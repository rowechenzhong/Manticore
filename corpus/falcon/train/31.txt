Positive and Negative Spaces
by Toni McGee Causey
When I first went to college, my major was Architecture. (I had not yet realized that I could actually be a writer as an official occupation.) I couldn’t wait to take architecture courses and I perused the curriculum in the student’s catalog and read through the course descriptions with a lust that most kids that age reserved for hot cars or cold beer. (The caveat—I already had a hot car—a 1968 cherry red Mustang,
and I had access to plenty of cold beer.) (Hi Dad. I totally did not drink until I was officially 18, the legal age of drinking, because I was a very very good kid who did everything her dad told her.) (You cannot ground me retroactively, don’t even try.)
Anyway, I wanted to be an architect, and I imagined all the sorts of buildings I would design. I endured the first semester of boring classes and looked forward to being able to take Engineering Design, the very first freshman level course that was one of the official architecture courses.
(Frank Lloyd Wright -- Falling Water)
(Craftsman style house)
Turns out? They expect architects to use math much more sophisticated than simple addition and subtraction to formulate all of those pesky things like load bearing walls that will hold the building up.
It is apparently not kosher to make wild-ass guesses, which is how I would frequently solve math problems, and they heavily frowned on the eeny-meeny-miny-moe method. Ironically, I had placed out of every math requirement, including calculus—I had this uncanny ability to guess the right answers on tests, and yet, my professors, picky bastards, would not go with the percentage route that I was going to be correct a good solid 80 to 90% of the time. 10% to 20% of the buildings falling down would be bad.
It was a very short career.
In spite of that, I’ve remained fascinated with architecture over the years, as well as interior design. I pore over magazines and web sites, absorbing new trends. I have dozens of coffee table books with photos of spaces—old plantations, castles, bungalows along an Italian coastline, the white cities of Greece.
Recently, Janet Reid recommended a little book titled: 101 Things I Learned in Architecture School by Matthew Frederick. I love this little book. Since I didn’t even get past “2 things I learned…” in my own career, it was like having a crash course in all of the cool terms I’d wanted to study, but hadn’t. Some of these things I had picked up in my journeys, but it’s nice to see them laid out so simply. What I expected when I bought the book: to learn a few more terms, satiate that longing to design by at least sidling up to it and conversing with it a bit.
What I had not expected when I bought it is to see an entire book that has as much to do with writing and living as it does architecture. And I hadn’t expected to have a startling revelation about my own life.
Now, to be fair to Mr. Frederick, he did not design the book with the latter in mind—it’s something I simply “saw” in the book. Which is a bit ironic, since the revelation occurred over the architectural term “positive and negative space.”
Mr. Frederick defines these terms thusly:
“We move through negative spaces and dwell in positive spaces.”
It’s a simple concept.
When I thought about this in relation to writing, I had a twofold appreciation for the term. First off, just the physical aspect of the page—the words and paragraphs create positive space and the white space around it is the negative space. If you pick up any manuscript and it’s filled with long, dense paragraph after paragraph, it feels cluttered and heavy, weighted and overwrought, even before you’ve read a single word. A reader brings with her the expectation of balance, and you need white space to achieve that balance. Too much white space, though, feels bereft of weight, of value, of deeper meaning, and so it’s the writer’s job not only to craft the words, but to pay attention to the space those words take up on the page.
Simple enough, right?
The other meaning when applied to writing is the creation of the worlds we hope to evoke. Mr. Frederick goes on to explain:
“The shapes and qualities of architectural spaces greatly influence human experience and behavior, for we inhabit the spaces of our built environment and not the solid walls, roofs, and columns that shape it. Positive spaces are almost always preferred by people for lingering and social interaction. Negative spaces tend to promote movement rather than dwelling in place.”
(a place to dwell--a positive place)
(An example of a city street--a corridor--a negative space.)
Again, simple.
In writing a book, we’re attempting to create a world. We want to do such a fine job, that the readers feel as if they’ve inhabited that world and that they’ve met the people who live there, and know them well.
One time, a long time ago, my husband and I were house shopping. In the course of a random conversation with a man we’d met, he mentioned that he and his wife were about to put their house up for sale. When he described the location, it piqued our interest, because it was very close to where we’d been previously looking, and this house happened to be on a small lake with a decent view. It was the exact size we were looking for and, miracle of miracles, it was in our price range. We made an appointment to go view the home and double-checked with the owner prior to arriving to make sure the time was still convenient, since, obviously, they were still living in the home and it wasn’t yet listed.
We wound through the neighborhood of unique homes and arrived at his address to see a beautiful Craftsman styled house set against big oaks and a few pine trees. The landscaping was impeccable—and lush. They’d eschewed the boxy, regimented style of an English garden look and had, instead, created a free-flowing design that invited you to move through a winding walkway through a wonderland of color until you reached the front door. We had a hard time keeping our mouths from gaping open with awe and lust. I didn’t want them to add another $20K just from the look on our faces.
(similar to this)
Crossing through the threshold, however, was a shock. Though the home was beautifully designed, you couldn’t tell it for the clutter. Now, I have two sons and a husband, all of whom could easily be celebrated on the poster for “Packrats Unlimited,” so I’m not unfamiliar with the challenges of digging out from under the constant influx of junk. But this? This house was piled with detritus beyond my wildest imagination. Every level surface had piles and piles of paperwork. In the dining room, the table (which could have seated eight) had a pile so high, that the chandelier above it (and these were ten foot ceilings) was actually skewed at an angle, resting on the top of the pile. Every countertop, every sink, toilet, bed, side table: junk. We couldn’t enter the spare bedroom, though they opened the door to show us the room; there was junk piled from floor to ceiling, spanning the entire room. It looked as if someone had routinely just opened the door and tossed items in, for years.
(And waaaaaay worse than this...)
When we left there, my husband wondered if they were moving because they wanted a bigger house. I predicted that they weren’t going to even get the house officially listed and that within a year, they’d be divorced and battling over the house in a lawsuit. It didn’t surprise me in the least to see it for sale a year later with an “Owner recently divorced, highly motivated” notation on the listing.
They had not created for themselves a positive space to dwell; instead, they’d created a negative space that they could only move through. Disconnected, they became apathetic to their needs—each others’ and their own—and the family dissolved.
I’ve had people hand me novels in the past for critique and they spend a couple of chapters (or more) “building the world” – telling the reading about the political and economic machinations which have brought this world into being, into the state we find it in at this moment in time. It’s a huge mistake to do this. For one thing, the story hasn’t started yet until the characters are moving through that world and experience conflict within it. For another, the writer isn’t trusting the reader to extrapolate the positive and negative spaces from a select few examples.
If you look at the paragraph above describing the clutter, I’d be willing to bet you mentally filled in those rooms, though I didn’t describe a single stick of furniture, or the style of the interior. You filled every nook and cranny with junk in your image, though I didn’t get very specific about the junk. What’s more, if you thought about the couple, I’d be willing to be you saw them both in rather rumpled, dragged from the laundry basket wrinkled clothes, though I never described them.
We don’t have to give pages and pages of details—we just need to give a select few that show not only the space the characters are in, but how they’re interacting with that space. Some of our own choices are determined by economics which can be beyond our control, but some of the choices we make in our surroundings communicate who we are and what we think of ourselves. Same with our characters and their worlds: how do they dwell? What do they move through? Why? What does their surroundings say about them? What does yours say about you?
While I was thinking about this application of the architectural terms of negative and positive space, and simultaneously reading JT’s blog about the clutter of the online media and the expectations of what we have to do to create a writing career and maintain it, along with marketing it, I had an abrupt-but-fine appreciation for the connotations of positive and negative spaces and how they impact our lives. With regard to the social media/marketing aspect, I think the online world—particularly Twitter and Facebook—create the illusion of positive space, a space to dwell. Only, there is no “space” there, there is no permanent peace or interaction with tangible walls and windows, living areas and social areas. It’s all hallways and moving, traffic and business with the veneer of being social, and at its most fundamental sociological construct, it’s in disharmony with our need to dwell, because in social media, we’re always moving through. Targeting something—more interaction, more movement, more recognition, more awareness (both of each other, of marketing needs and trends, of products, not necessarily just of our own products).
It makes sense, then, that these sorts of venues create a sense of discord over time. I think it’s ironic, but I think that while it gives the illusion of greater intimacy and friendship, it also emphasizes the disconnect we have in our lives because we’re not interacting with a space or with a person, but with a computer screen. I enjoy Twitter, and, tangentially, Facebook, but I have felt far less stress in this last month since I have cut back my interaction at both places to just a few minutes a day.
Aside from that, though, is another fundamental truth of space, and it’s the fact that we build our environment. We choose where we’re going to dwell (or, at least, what we surround ourselves with in our dwelling place). The epiphany I had when reading Mr. Frederick’s book was that the positive and negative spaces were a part of our philosophy of life, not just our physicality in life. (I know this is not a new concept. It just opened up something for me.)
I’ve always been the type of person who was an overachiever. I’d accomplish something, check it off as done and move on to the next thing. It felt lazy, almost, to just… be. To be in a place and time without some sort of pressing item that needed to be achieved next. The problem with this was that I was dwelling in the corridors of my life. If something was done, it was over and I passed on through to the next challenge, and there was no space to just enjoy.
In the world of publishing, there is always the next hurdle. Always.
As soon as you finish a book, you have to try to get an agent. As soon as you get an agent, you have to try to sell it. As soon as you sell it, you have to start worrying about what changes they’re going to want and whether you can deliver that. As soon as you deliver that, there are marketing decisions that are made (often without your input) and marketing decisions you make (which increases the pressure), because now there is a goal: sell the books. While all of this is going on, you’re trying to either write the next book on a contract (and you are worrying whether or not you can hit the bar you’ve set for yourself again, whether you even remember how to write a book, and why on earth did you think you could do it again?) or you’re trying your dead level best to convince someone that yes, you can write another one and here it is, or here is the proposal. As soon as your first book goes on sale, all sorts of goals will crop up—will it do well enough, will it further your career, will it die a stone cold death and stop your career. If the former, the bar is set higher. If the latter, that’s a whole set of other problems / goals / fears. People will tell you to stop and enjoy the moment, but you’re generally so frantic to accomplish all of the stuff you need to accomplish in the short window that your book will be on the shelf that by the time you think you have time to stop and enjoy it, it’s long past gone and is probably buried under the last three goals you were striving for.
It is very difficult to just “be” and dwell.
But positive.
So beyond just the writing applications of space and how it’s relevant to character development, my own personal philosophy has shifted in priorities: take the time to enjoy the people around you. Take the time to look at the things you have done and enjoy them. Dwell. Be. Replenish. The world and the race will still be there when you’re ready to re-join. There is no one final race anyway, but millions of races. If you don’t join this day’s race, you can join tomorrow’s.
Questions:
What is one thing you’d change about your physical environment that would make it a more pleasant place to dwell? Does your environment reflect the real you? If not, why not?

Hi Toni,
I enjoyed your commentary.
As a writer who began life as a visual artist I like to be reminded of the concept of positive and negative space. Our lives need both, our writing needs both. Perhaps everything needs both positive and negative to survive.
It is interesting how easy it is to get wrapped up in the process of becoming a successful writer.
Aw, Toni, I just want to hug this post. I love it. I'm sitting here nodding along and expecting my head to roll off my neck any second now.
To answer your questions would require miles of space, considering my life is in flux right now, but the most important thing I hold onto is that I know where that positive space is, and somehow I'll get there. At least I can visit it until I get all my ducks in a row.
There's something so exhilarating about finding that one place where everything just feels right. There's a little more color, the air around you is a little sweeter, and you feel utterly free. And yet you've never felt more connected.
Great post! A very good way at looking at writing.
This post is just what I needed read right now. My newest book is just now on the market and I'm hot into marketing--worrying about those issues you mentioned--will it be good enough to notice, will folks like it, what if they don't? Can I get the energy up to continue on?
Positive and negative space is truly something to address right now -- as i market, and celebrate, and accept what I have indeed accomplished. Thanks

Hi Karla - thank you! Sent you an email on FB. ;)
Kate, I think you're 100% correct - we definitely need both positive and negative spaces. We need to remember how to slow down and savor, and we also need to feel comfortable moving through space, getting to where we need to go, if that makes sense.
JM, thank you -- and I love love love that last paragraph you wrote there. It's so true--when we find the right place for us, we feel both connected and free.
Vicki, thank you!
Sylvia, I so empathize right now--it's incredibly nerve-wracking and almost debilitating the sheer volume of marketing stuff we have to attend to when a first book comes out, instead of having the creative space to really think about and work on the second book. I am one of those authors who'll do a lot for a book, and I feel like that's been a good thing, in many ways. But recently, I've come to the conclusion that I have to draw the line, I have to protect the creativity, the mental space where the work takes place. Because if I make myself crazy trying to get attention for this book (whatever "this" book is), I won't be in a good mental place to create something better, and only by creating something better will I entice more readers.
Here's to you finding the balance you deserve, and in doing so, reap so much success, it's beyond your imagination. :)
Toni - This was wonderful. This is a little OT but it reminded me of something about space. I lived in the desert for 8 healing years. Later I read a book called Finding Fran. In it Fran speaks of living outside of Taos, NM and all the wide open spaces. I'm paraphrasing but she says something to the effect that Space Empties You. That resonated with my experience. All those hours of quiet in the desert emptied negative stuff right out of me.
Toni, Thank You for allowing me to re-post this. It blew me away the first time I read it, and I found it to be every bit as powerful and thought provoking the second time around.
I know an author, Wade Hall, who has blue prints of a Frank Lloyd Wright house that was never constructed. He is planning to have it built as the centerpiece of a rural writers retreat on some beautiful wooded property he owns. He took me through the location, and it will make a great positive space for writers someday. Your take on architecture/writer was fascinating. One of the most intirguing posts I've read in a while.
What is the title and/or artist of the painting of the woman crouching within an "invisible box"?
Anon -- I apologize -- I cannot find it again! I tried to go back to that image in order to answer it, but it was originally saved on a computer that crashed and I didn't move the data (artist, link) over apparently when I had moved the blog files. Very sorry not to be able to answer--I don't even have a clue how I found it. I tried googling all of the relevant key words I could think that I might have used before, and nada! argh. Very sorry--I am usually much better at giving attributions.Pune: A mock drill to gauge fire-fighting preparedness at Pune airport was held at the Lohegaon air base on Tuesday.
Though the drill was a routine exercise, it caused a flutter among locals residing in nearby areas seeing movement of fire tenders at the Lohegaon air-base.
A routine mock drill to test fire fighting preparedness was performed at the airport, an Air Force spokesman said, dismissing reports of any disturbance in the flight schedule.
City fire brigade officials, who too were unaware of the exercise, said they had been asked to keep two fire engines ready as stand-by, adding that the grass along the runway had reportedly been burnt.
The Pune airport is part of the Air Force base from where civil flights operate.New School Now On Paper
As it stands now, the design of a new Northside Elementary School in La Crosse will differ from other schools in the area. District Chief, Randy Nelson talks about plans for 1611 Kane Street.
Franklin Elementary School is set to be raised sometime this summer to make way for the new school, being paid for with referendum dollars approved in November.Gun, ammo stolen from Md. cop car
The advice on avoiding car break-ins is pretty clear by clicking the "Don't Forget" link at the bottom of the Montgomery County Police Department's home page:
"Remove electronics, their accessories and other valuables from view or even better, take them with you."
Nobody's perfect.
Sometime Monday night or Tuesday morning, a thief broke into an unmarked police vehicle parked outside the officer's home in the 2500 block of Sapling Ridge Drive in Brookeville, about 12 miles north of the Capital Beltway.
The thief took a Colt M-4 Rifle, two loaded M-4 magazines, two sets of handcuffs, two Montgomery County Police badges, an ASP baton and two loaded .40-caliber Glock magazines, according to the department.
"It is not a normal practice or policy of the Montgomery County Police Department officers and detectives to store their weapons and other serialized equipment overnight in a marked or unmarked police vehicle," police said in a statement.
Detectives are asking anyone with information about the crime to call 240-773-5530 or 301-279-8000. Anonymous callers can use 1-866-411-TIPS (8477).

You have to figure out a healthy balance of fear within yourself in order to see growth and success as an entrepreneur. Read more in the article I published in Tech Cocktail.
Before I started my first company, I didn’t believe in stress. I genuinely thought people just complained a lot. Then, I racked up a $100,000 American Express bill from overspending without tracking my advertising, and I became a believer in work-related stress.
The saying goes “If you’re not scared, you’re not doing it right.” My first real experience of stress and fear in business was a result of mistakes I made, but I’m glad it happened or I wouldn’t have succeeded as an entrepreneur.
The only way to make monumental leaps in growth is to put your business on the line and learn to tolerate a healthy dose of fear. But you don’t want to let your personal well-being suffer, or your business may not last. Stress can drive you to get important tasks done, but leading a healthy and balanced life benefits you much more.
Balance Your Personal Well-Being
Although everyone knows that eating well and exercising are important, many people fail to make these things a priority. They don’t realize that focusing on a healthy lifestyle will benefit any business indefinitely. With better sleep and nutrition, you’ll be more focused and more productive during the workday, and you’ll also be able to use your time away from work more effectively.
I couldn’t run a business if I didn’t feel healthy. This means that a fair amount of my schedule each week is devoted to exercise. People might say that this takes away from time I should devote to work, but it makes me healthier — both psychologically and physically — so I can handle the potential stressors that land on my desk every day. When you get stressed, you carry that with you outside of work, and it affects other areas of your life.
Good health during the day is closely related to good sleep at night. Every time someone confides in me about his difficulty in finding restful sleep at night, I soon learn that he doesn’t exercise enough. I exercise at least once a day, and I never have trouble sleeping. Sleep is grossly underrated. When you sleep well at night, you have more energy and focus during the day, and everything feels more manageable.
The Balancing Act
Just as you must make an effort to balance your health priorities as an entrepreneur, you must also learn how to strike a good balance between the manageable dose of fear that comes from taking calculated business risks and the constant stress that eats away at your health. Here are three tactics you can use to improve your life and keep work stress at bay:
Track Metrics. Track metrics such as revenue, gross profit, and advertising spending on a daily basis. This will help you spot discrepancies or issues long before they become debilitating problems for your business. This leads to better business results and offers you peace of mind.
Make Yourself Less Available. I’m notorious for not being attached to my phone and laptop. I hire people I trust to be competent and creative enough to solve problems on their own. When I don’t answer every text or call immediately, it gives them an opportunity to resolve urgent issues without my help. This is counterintuitive for many people, but it’s better for you to focus on other things when you can — and for your employees to become more self-sufficient.
Don’t Check Email after 7 p.m. The exact time might vary from person to person, but several hours before you go to sleep, you need to shut your laptop and forget about work for the night. I hate when I slip up on this — there’s always an email about a problem. When I see it, I either end up working on a resolution for several hours, or I worry about it all night. Either way, I lose sleep, which we’ve already established is bad for your business. It’s OK to refuse to let work issues affect your nights.
Use Fear to Your Advantage
I don’t agree with Donald Trump’s belief that you should focus on revenge in business, but it’s not a bad thing to instill a healthy fear of your company in your competitors. Fear and stress can go both ways, and a strong competitive advantage is good for three reasons:
1. If your competitors know they can’t treat you like other companies, they’ll be less likely to sabotage your marketing efforts or attempt to defame your brand.
2. If your competitors are afraid of your brand power, they’ll be less likely to try to directly compete with you, which helps your business.
3. If your competitors fear your business’s drive to excel, they might leave the market completely, resulting in less competition and higher margins for you.
You need a healthy level of fear and stress to succeed as an entrepreneur, but if you’re too full of anxiety, your stress can paralyze your business. Finding balance for yourself moves your business forward and keeps it standing long enough to see the risks pay off. Make some changes and see the results: When you’re leading a healthy life, your body and mind aren’t the only things that will benefit.

This is a good version of the classic Chicken Caesar. We make it with Hannah's Homemade Croutons Hannah's homemade parmesan croutons - or eat in pitas with tomato.
I used to have a chicken caesar salad at Smokey Mountain Pizza, until they closed down! I have been trying to duplicate it at home-now with success! This was SO good. I didn't use any carrot; used chopped red onions instead-just a few croutons (used whole grain) & fat free caesar dressing. I mixed a little lemon juice & black pepper into the dressing for a kick. It turned out GREAT! I loved the grilled chicken part-added a little italian seasoning for more flavor. Thanks so much for sharing this!
Scaled this down for 2 servings for a quick lunch for me and my BF... I grilled the chicken on our gas grill and let it cool slightly as I prepared Kittencal's Famous Caesar Salad to use for the dressing. I did not use the shredded carrots because I was too lazy to shred them and my BF doesn't think they belong on a caesar salad! Love, love, love this quick and easy salad that really packs a punch, flavor wise... Thanks so much for sharing!

Huh? I don't get it
If this is an attempt at trying to be funny, you failed, big time. Besides the title is Tom Fulp is gay yet you don't even have Tom in your flash! You just had two poorly drawn characters. The black kid you voiced, was clearly a stereotype, and a bad one at that. I could see why people call you racist. You took the time to make this and of course you're going to get negative feedback. Just be a big boy and take it.

Microsoft CEO Steve Ballmer will show off tablets, including Samsung and Dell models, running Windows 7 at the CES event in January, a source has told The New York Times.Microsoft CEO Steve Ballmer is expected to introduce a number of tablet devices meant to-you guessed it-compete with the Apple iPad in the market that Microsoft first created in 2000 and that Apple revived and reinvented this year with the iPad. Citing "people familiar with Microsoft's plans," The New York Times reported Dec. 13 that the big reveal is expected to occur at January's Consumer Electronics Show (CES) and that the devices, which will run the Windows 7 operating system, will likely come from Samsung and Dell, among others.
The Samsung device is expected to be "-similar in size and shape to the Apple iPad, although it is not as thin,'" reported the Times, quoting its source. "-It also includes a unique and slick keyboard that slides out from below for easy typing.'" The tablet is also expected to "run the Windows 7 operating system when in landscape mode, but will also have a layered interface that will appear when the keyboard is hidden and the device is held in a portrait mode.".

Actually, it has been, somewhat.
On Monday (my day off), I didn't really have to do anything until the evening, when I checked in with RCIA and we had a brief liturgy in which I anointed the catechumens. But the Altar Society of St. Mary Parish had a meeting, and I hadn't yet been with them, so I joined them for lunch. But I did get to sleep late -- which is why I woke up at 6 am...
Tuesday, I had the school Mass, then briefly in the office, spent opening lots of mail and directing it hither and thither. Then quickly write some remarks to share with the Rotary Club (I talked about the date of Christmas, and how it might be more valid than previously thought -- thanks to Mark Shea, who I did credit in my talk), then back to the office, a little office work (the pile on my desk is pretty heavy right now), then a rehearsal for servers for Christmas.
This morning, I worked on my homily for Christmas Eve; I still need to write a homily for Sunday, and for Christmas Midnight Mass. I will probably use the same homily from midnight, for 9 am.
One of the things pastors have to do is be supervisors: I have a number of employees, and this is the time of year when I meet with them, give them an annual review. Each of these should be written, and we meet and talk. If a supervisor does his job, this isn't scary, because there should be no surprises. Rather, it should be very positive. Of course, this should be happening in various ways throughout the year. But keeping track of information, and following up (i.e., I look back at past reviews) help make it time-consuming. I really should have had this done by now, as I'm now racing to get it done before Christmas.
I hope to decorate my Christmas Tree this weekend.

Why is it that our best intentions to get ready early for Christmas, be it shopping or decorating or just getting other responsibilities out of the way so we can enjoy the holidays, never seem to work? Every year I try so hard to get ready early and it never seems to work. Oh well, at least I am in good company as I can't think of too many people who are ready.
I hope you have a wonderful and blessed Christmas.
Father, did you move to your "new" home yet or are you still across from the beer joint? Be nice if you were away from there in time for the New Year's Eve revelry, ha.
Think the world is full of people having last minute rush for Christmas. It seems that no matter how much I plan not to get involved in that hectic scene, it happens anyway - so many unanticipated surprises or snafus pop up. The most delicious part of Christmas is going to Mass - and trying not to doze off in the sudden peace!
Have a wonderful Christmas season, Father Fox! Julia
Father, sounds like my life these days -- all kinds of unexpected challenges, most of course involving preparations for Christmas. I hope that you have a truly Blessed Christmas, filled with beautiful music! God bless, Patricia GonzalezLCS Boys Golf

Mid-Missouri hosts King Kat Tournament Trail
Thursday, April 17, 2014
A professional catfish tournament will be casting into the Missouri River on Saturday.
The Cabela’s King Kat Tournament Trail will hold the day’s weigh-in at 4 p.m. at the Noren Access in north Jefferson City, where spectators are welcome.
“Hopefully we’ll see some monster catfish,” said Chris Wilson, sports and film sales manager with the Jefferson City Convention and Visitors Bureau.
But fishermen will be launching by 6:30 a.m. from the north I-70 bridge west of Columbia to the Missouri 47 bridge in Washington.
Up to 75 boats, usually with two fishermen each, are expected at this first-year event, which will proceed no matter the weather.
This is a catch-and-release event. Blue Cat, Channel Cat and Flathead Cat at least 15 inches long may be weighed.
Local fishermen have been traveling to other sites for tournaments. Now, they can stay here and others may come to the Capital City, he said.
“A sanctioned catfish tournament makes sense to use the Missouri River, one of our greatest venues,” Wilson said.
These professionals will share tips at a 7 p.m. seminar Friday evening at the North Jefferson City Recreation Room.
Crappie USA and Cabela’s King Kat Trail also will host a Kids Fishing Rodeo 9-11 a.m. at Binder Park, west of Jefferson City.
Children ages 12 and younger may sign-up between 8-9 a.m. at the Binder Lake Deck, 1200 Binder Lake Road, and must be accompanied by a parent or guardian.
The tournament trail began in February in Manning, S.C. A total of 18 trail sites will wrap-up in October in Camden, S.C.
“With prize money, we’re likely to see some mighty fine fishermen,” Wilson said. “They are extremely qualified.”

Israeli Air Force
Found in: Israel Defense Forces Israeli Air Force
The Israeli Air Force is the air force of the Israel Defense Forces. The current Commander in Chief is Major General Ido Nehoshtan. The Israeli Air Force has approximately 1000 aircraft and is regarded as one of the greatest air forces in the world due to their gaining air supremacy in the Middle-East.
History
Early years (1948-1957) and 62 Spitfire LF Mk IXE. Creativity and resourcefulness were the early foundations of Israeli military success in the air, rather than technology . War
During the Six-Day War, the Israeli Air Force achieved air supremacy
In the War of Attrition, the IAF operated in air "dog fight" and bombing of strategic targets deep within enemy's territory. Notable operations were:
September 11, 1969: IAF planes shot down 12 Egyptian jet fighters in dog fights.
September 26, 1969 - Operation Rooster 53: IAF Super Frelon and Sikorsky CH-53 Yas'ur helicopters carried paratroopers in a raid to capture and airlift back an advanced Soviet P-12 radar deployed in Egypt near Suez. A CH-53 helicopter carried the 4-ton radar back, tethered underneath it.
January 7, 1970: the IAF started Soviet-piloted Egyptian MiG-21 fighters.
Yom Kippur War
In the Yom Kippur War of October 1973, the IAF suffered heavy casualties from Soviet anti-aircraft surface-to-air missiles, but managed to regroup and assist IDF ground forces and later bomb targets in Syria and Egypt. One of the first battles in the war's air front was the Ofira Air Battle, involving two Israeli Phantoms versus 28 Egyptian Mig-17s and Mig-21s, and resulting in 7 downed Egyptian planes and disengagment of the rest. IAF helicopters proved to be highly useful in logistics and rescue efforts (MedEvac). According to Israel, during that war, the IAF lost 102 planes while the Egyptian Air Force lost 235 and the Syrian Air Force lost 135, although these figures are contested.
Growth (1973-82)
Following the Yom Kippur War, most of Israel's military aircraft have been obtained from the United States. Those included the F-4 Phantom II, A-4 Skyhawk, F-15 Eagle, . The Kfir was adapted to utilize a more powerful US engine, produced under license in Israel. In 1976, the IAF participated in the Operation Entebbe rescue mission in Uganda using the C-130 Hercules for transport.
During the 1980s and 1990s the IAF was equipped with a variety of additional U.S. aircraft .
Bombing of the Osiraq nuclear reactor
On June 7, 1981 eight IAF F-16A fighters covered by six F-15A jets flew in Operation Opera (also referred to as Operation Babylon or Operation Ofra) to bomb and destroy the Iraq nuclear facilities of Osiraq. Among the pilots that took part in the attack was the late Colonel Ilan Ramon, Israel's first astronaut. The planes returned to Israel very low on fuel.
1982 Lebanon War and its aftermath
During the 1982 Lebanon War, IAF planes destroyed many Syrian air defences (most of them in Operation Mole Cricket 19) and shot down 100 Syrian aircraft without losing a single fighter plane in an air to air combat.
During the war, IAF AH-1 Cobra helicopter gunships destroyed dozens of Syrian armored fighting vehicles and other ground targets, including some T-72 main battle tanks. presence in Lebanon the IAF AH-1 Cobras continued to mount attacks on Hezbollah and PLO militant positions in south Lebanon.
Bombing of the PLO headquarters in Tunis
A response to a PLO terrorist attack which resulted in the murder of three Israeli civilians in Cyprus, Operation Wooden Leg took place on October 1, 1985. The strike involved the bombing of PLO Headquarters in Tunis, Tunisia, by F-15 Eagles. This was the longest combat mission ever undertaken by the IAF, a stretch of 2300 kilometers, involving in-flight refueling by an IAF Boeing 707. As a result, PLO headqurters and barracks were either destroyed or damaged. Derby missiles. In 1991, the IAF participated in Operation Solomon which brought Ethiopian Jews to Israel. Also, the IAI Lavi was canceled.
That same year, Israel was attacked by Iraqi Scud missiles during the first Gulf War. Israeli Air Force pilots were on constant stand-by in their cockpits throughout the conflict, ready to fly to Iraq to retaliate. Diplomatic pressure from the United States, however, kept the IAF grounded while Coalition air assets and Patriot missile batteries supplied by the U.S. and the Netherlands sought to deal with the Scuds., and considered among the best in its field, as well as a special version of the Apache Longbow, designated AH-64DI or Saraph. In 2005 the Israeli Air Force received special Gulfstream V jets (known as "Nachshon"), modified with the newest and most advanced intelligence systems in the world, all made by Israel Military Industries.
Three IAF squadrons , based at Sedot Mikha airbase, are thought to be responsible for Israel's surface-to-surface nuclear strike capability, maintaining a stockpile of between 21 and 100 Jericho I and II medium-range ballistic missiles. The Jericho III, capable of reaching targets throughout the Middle East and Europe, as well as much of Africa and Asia, is thought to be currently entering service, with a test launch in early 2008.
During the al-Aqsa intifada, the IAF was largely employed in targeted killings of leaders of Palestinian militant groups, most notably Salah Shakhade, Mahmoud Abu-Hunud, Abu Ali Mustafa, Ahmed Yassin and Abed al-Aziz Rantissi. This policy is controversial - due to the collateral damage caused in certain instances. Israel claims it is vital to fight terrorism and that IAF pilots do whatever they can to avoid civilian casualties - including aborting strikes.
After a landmark 1994 High Court appeal by a Jewish immigrant from South Africa, Alice Miller, the Air Force was instructed to open its flight school to women. Miller passed her entrance exams, yet failed the medical tests and thus did not qualify. The first female fighter pilot successfully received her wings in 2001 (several female navigators graduated before her).
In September 2007, the Israeli Air Force successfully bombed an alleged Syrian nuclear reactor in Operation Orchard.
Records and highlights. The IAF relies on its Air Intelligence Directorate for intelligence, including analysis of aerial photography. Many of the IAF's electronics and weapons systems are developed and built in Israel by Israel Military Industries, Israel Aerospace
June 5, 1967 the Six Day War: The destruction of the entire Egyptian air-force within three hours. By the end of the day the Syrian and Jordanian air forces were wiped out as well. The IAF shoot-down total at the end of the war was a claimed record of 451 enemy aircraft downed versus nineteen of its own. See: Operation Focus.
War of Attrition
March,
Oct.
However in this war over 50 planes were lost due to the introduction of new Soviet air defence.
Israeli Air Force was the first Air Force that fought against the new Soviet doctrine of advancing mechanized forces covered by overlapping different surface based anti aircraft systems.
1982 Lebanon War
June 8, 1982 1982 Lebanon War: The destruction of the entire Soviet supplied Syrian air-defence system in Lebanon within a few hours without a single warplane lost; Syria with the help of the Soviet Union built up an overlapping network of surface-to-air missiles. It achieved in dogfights a total of 80 Syrian planes shoot-downs, without a single Israeli plane being shot down.
2006 Lebanon War
The IAF played a critical role in the 2006 Lebanon War by leading the Israeli attacks on Hezbollah. These strikes mainly, though not exclusively, in southern Lebanon were aimed at stopping rocket launches by Hezbollah's militia targetting. four male and one female aircrew members. Earlier, an IAF F-16I had crashed during take-off. Israeli aircraft also shot down three armed Iranian aerial drones during the conflict.
Other
The only documented successful emergency landing of an F-15 with one wing, after losing the starboard wing after an airborne collision with an A-4 Skyhawk during training. The Skyhawk exploded and its pilot ejected. McDonnell-Douglas, manufacturer of the F-15, refused to believe it was possible until photos of the incident were released. The F-15 was subsequently restored to flight status.
"Ace" pilots: 39 IAF pilots have shot down at least five jet planes, ten out of them shot down at least eight jet planes.
"Ace of Aces": Colonel Giora Epstein shot down seventeen jet planes, holding the world record of jet aircraft shot down, and the most aircraft shot of any type down since the Korean War.
Obtaining the first shoot-downs for the American fighter jets, the F-15 and the F-16. [*]
The first possible shoot-downs of their own American fighter jets, the F-16s and F-15. [*]
Pilot Selection and Training
The selection process for IAF pilots can be traced to Ezer Weizman, widely considered the architect of the modern Israeli Air Force, and his aim of recruiting only "the best for pilots." His reasoning was that the skill and bravery of the ground forces would be for naught if they could be attacked at will from the air. As a result, only those thought to possess the innate ability to succeed as Israeli pilots are even invited to begin the training process, and only the most qualified succeed in completing what is seen by many as the world's most demanding military selection course.
Consequently, potential Israeli pilots are identified prior to reporting for national service at age 18, based on factors such as high grades in school and top scores on standardized tests, excellent physical condition and high technical aptitude. Those who meet these and other criteria are invited to participate in a six-day gibush (cohesion), a selection phase involving physical, mental, and sociometric challenges. Recruits are screened not only for their ability to perform the tasks assigned, but for their attitude in performing them such as how they take hardships and unexpected difficulties, how well they work in groups and how they approach problem solving and disaster management situations. As many as 90 percent of those who commence the gibush will be dropped from further consideration at its conclusion.
Those who pass the gibush embark on a three-year journey to earn their wings, which includes extensive flight training, infantry training, officer's course, and studies towards an academic degree (a B.A. or B.Sc.). The prospective pilots are evaluated constantly, and the vast majority of those who begin flight training do not make it through the full program. Those expelled from the course will either remain in the air force in a non-flying capacity, or transfer to an army unit; this is dependent to a large degree on the stage at which they leave the course.
While in flying school, future pilots are sorted and assigned to train on different types of aircraft. Few become fighter pilots (considered by some to be the most desirable assignment), while the remainder learn to fly helicopters, transport aircraft, or train as navigators.
The pilot course was opened to women in 1995, though the first female pilot did not receive her wings until 2001 (Several female navigators graduated earlier.) While Israeli Arabs may volunteer to serve in the IDF, it is unclear whether they can seek air force training. In 2006, an Israeli Arab applied to be considered for the pilot program, but was not accepted.

Sheldon Kowalchuk Resource Conservation ManagerWapusk National Park & Manitoba North National Historic Sites
In April of 2010, research facilities in the Churchill area received a huge injection of funds when the Churchill Northern Studies Centre (CNSC) was successful in obtaining $11,000,000 from Indian and Northern Affairs Canada (INAC) as part of the Arctic Research Infrastructure Fund (ARIF). The ARIF is an $85,000,000 program that is part of Canada’s Economic Action Plan. The fund is designed to invest in maintaining and upgrading key arctic research facilities.
The CNSC is the key research facility in the Churchill area and, with the new construction occurring at that site in addition to upgrades to existing infrastructure, the CNSC will continue to be the centre of attention for many researchers in the Churchill region for years to come. The CNSC is a launching point to access the northern portion of Wapusk National Park (NP). The funding proposal by the CNSC also included a number of partners that have a research interest in WNP. There are a number of outlying research camps and facilities in Wapusk NP that have supported researchers in their work and some have been in operation for nearly four decades.
In total, approximately $750,000 will be spent on research infrastructure within Wapusk NP over the two-year life of this program. The implementation plan for the work in the park is split into two key phases. The design, acquisition and transportation of materials by over snow vehicle is occurring in 2009-10. The majority of the construction will occur in the summer of 2010.
The investment in Wapusk NP will occur at four locations. The Nester One research camp is owned by the Province of Manitoba and activities at this location include the construction of a new washroom building and upgrades to the viewing tower and kitchen building. At the Nestor Two research camp, operated by the Hudson Bay Project, two new buildings will be constructed to replace the existing bunkhouse and kitchen building. A new water and wastewater treatment unit will also be installed to provide potable water to the camp in addition to treating all wastewater. Parks Canada will be constructing a backcountry cabin, washroom building and a water and wastewater treatment unit at Broad River and a fenced compound, backcountry cabin and shed at Owl River.
There has always been a great interest by researchers to work in this part of the world and that is likely to continue in the future. The funding provided by INAC was a timely source of funds to improve research facilities in the Churchill area and in Wapusk NP and will leave a legacy for years to come.Regional News of Sunday, 3 June 2012

Mr. Victor Smith, the Eastern Regional Minister, has cut the sod for the construction of an eighteen unit classroom block at the cost of GH¢863,000 for the Klo-Agogo Senior High School in the Yilo Krobo District.
The classroom block which is funded by the GETFund would be completed by the end of the year.
Mr. Smith also broke the ground for the construction of a six unit two storey classroom block for the Somanya Basic Schools complex.
The GH¢367,959.68 project which is being funded by the GETFund is expected to be completed in eight months.
The minister, who was on a familiarization tour of the District, said the projects formed part of the developmental agenda of the government and part of the “better Ghana agenda” program of government.
He urged teachers to help government train the young ones so that they do not become liability to society, and advised pupils and students to stay in school to get the appropriate skills and knowledge so that they can also contribute their quota to the development of the country.
The Regional Minister earlier inspected the completed twelve units two storey classroom blocks for the Somanya Presbyterian Basic Schools Complex and the completed Nkurankan D.A Junior High School complex.
Mr. Smith also inspected the on-going Klo-Agogo Hospital expansion project, the reconstruction of the Nkurankan market project, the on-going construction of Klo-Agogo to Oluahai feeder road, and broke the grounds for the development of the new Klo-Agogo market.** / 5 stars

What do you think?INTERNET übergeeks were beside themselves with anger last week after Apple Computer licensed a controversial patent on "one-click shopping" from online book-seller Amazon.com. It's one of the most heavily criticised Internet patents ever granted (
With one-click shopping, customers don't have to enter their name and bank details every time they buy something online. Instead, a small ID file called a cookie, planted on their hard drive, allows them to be billed automatically.
Amazon's patent was granted last September, and it sued online rival Barnes&noble.com a month later to stop it using a similar system. In December, a district court judge sided with Amazonbut Barnes&noble is appealing. "This is an example of a patent that public policy should not permit to be granted," says James Love, director of the Consumer Project on Technology, a Washington DC pressure group.

- the young Refs, the "Newbies", just up from the bushes, don't have a regular rhythm and every once in a while fake dropping the puck, this is murder on the timing of your center ice men.
- we need a dry land "Draw" competition...all centers...Ron Shock, Captain of the Penguins, 1976!
- the Leafs in a pretty evenly called "fair fight" type game get that gift from Stephen Walkom...can you imagine if that call had gone against Tranna!! One or two of those a year can keep your season going...
- Tranna still maintains a large minor penalty (power play) advantage over their opposition while fielding one of the "Dirtiest teams in the league!"
- Florida should have called J-S G (Just a Supersized Guy) for being the largest (Blue and White) beach ball the League has ever seen and had Walkom make Tranna forfeit the game! I count at least 5 measurements he exceeds!
- Stephen Walkom, like all come backs if you are past the "Best Before" date...you're done!!

The "Refs!"
Posted by Canucnik at 5:45:42 10:28:00 AM
It's crazy with the lack of penalties called against that 'truculent team' isn't it? Kinda makes you wonder if favorites are played.
That allowed goal by Orr last night was a JOKE.
I can't seem to find a replay but I saw a highlight this morning that indicated there should have been a penalty on Giguere just before the Kessel goal.
So the refs decided this game, which is something that should NEVER happen.
They are SUPPOSED to be totally impartial.. but for some teams it sure appears they are not.
I would just love to hear the refs explanation as to why they allowed that goal?
Sandy:
It was bad and then they shoot it in off his foot...there is something wrong with Walkom, he couldn't get along with the guys in the League Office and now he goes out on the road to get away from his wife...but he knows enough not to call a late in the game penalty on his adopted home town boys! Can you believe it, he teaches and runs a Referee's School called "Three Blind Mice" by his pupils!
Nik
Point 5 is a closely guarded secret Nik, and the stats state it clearly.
If you care for your life, you will forget what you know.
Toronto, the 2nd worst club in the league last season, was only one of 2, yes 2, + teams in PP for and against.
Hmmmm.
GNBut HALE. I didn't wear it for (in singsong) Halloween...!
*grins*
Last year, I was the Mad Hatter Hostess and Hubz sported a top hat with white rabbit ears. Cute, right?
So this year, I figured - what the hell - I'mma bust it out for the party. Here's the pic I tweeted that night, but you can't see my fangs. :(
Actually, they're these custom-fit "Love Bites" fangs, and are really subtle. Take a looksie:
Did you see Hubz's picture? Every year, that fucker bitches at me about what costume he's gotta wear that Hallow's Eve. He moans and groans, complains when I apply his make-up... he is just ALL OUT grumpy.
But I think it's all a facade. Coz you should see the way he works his costume. *shakes head* He runs the local full-service hotel, so this costume actually fit him perfectly. And did you see them monster boots?!
Skinny Ass is already tall at 6'5" - guess he just wanted to make sure you wouldn't miss him. ;)
And you know I had to throw one in there of those nefarious monsters of mine ;)
Hope you all had a wicked Halloween!!

Ha! Awesome costumes!
My 10 yr old wanted to dress as a vampire *ninja* Geisha, but I told her she had to choose just one this year. She chose Geisha. ;-)

Wore my troll fringe today just for the laughs! Been sorting out my bedroom today, I have so much stuff I dont even know what to do with it all! A Hoarder paired with compulsive buyer is not good combination. I found some bags earlier that I bought when I was 15, still with tags on never been used. I will be putting some of it on ebay eventually, Just so much effort! Wish it was simpler but there is always that one smarmy buyer who finds some sort of flaw on the inside right seam and demands a refund. So I have to go over everything and describe everything!
I love the touch of color with the scarf ! And your hat is so cute :)

say the project has been crippled by today's revelations that key
scientific documents might have been falsified.
And lawyers for the state are pouncing on the disclosures as key
evidence in the battle over Yucca Mountain.
Energy Secretary Samuel Bodman admitted today that a U-S
Geological Survey employee indicated in e-mails from 1998 to 2000
that he fabricated documentation about water infiltration and
climate at the site 90 miles northwest of Las Vegas.
One lawyer for the state says the question of whether water will
get into the tunnels and corrode casks containing the nation's
nuclear waste is the very heart of the technical dispute between
the state of Nevada and the Energy Department.
The state's planning to oppose the Energy Department application
for a Nuclear Regulatory Commission operating permit for the Yucca
site.
State Attorney General Brian Sandoval says the federal
government should suspend the plan in the interest of safety.
But a geologist and consultant for Nevada on technical elements
of the project says he wouldn't pronounce the plan dead.
He says project planners will redo work under appropriate
quality assurance -- or try to do quality assurance after-the-fact.The UK's fastest-growing regional news network

Home Maidstone News Article
Joele Leotta murder and wounding Mr Galbiati with intent to cause grievous bodily harm.
After arriving at the scene, PC Middleton provided first aid to Mr Galbiati and defendant Zuravliovas, who were both sitting on the pavement outside the Italian restaurant.
Police investigate the scene in Lower Stone Street
She was then called to the doorway leading upstairs to the bedsits, where Mr Leotta was unconscious.
PC Middleton told the court: “There was blood everywhere. What I remember most is a pool of blood under his head.”
PC Middleton and another colleague, PC Rachael Bryant, began CPR after failing to find a pulse. They continued to provide treatment until paramedics and a medically trained officer, PC James Arnold, arrived and took over.
PC Middleton searched the property, including the Italians’ room. She said: “There was blood and broken and overturned furniture. There were massive holes in the wall.”
Mr Leotta had suffered 100 injures and died hours later in hospital.
It took officers around 15 minutes to discover the fatal attack was unfolding just yards away from Maidstone Police Station.
Alex Galbiati
DI Ivan Beasley said: “From the first call that was made, the police operator and others working behind the scenes were trying to establish where the caller was in order to send the appropriate help or assistance.
“This included a three-way conversation with an interpreter and also trying to locate the mobile phone location through GPS.”
Jurors have also heard this week how another tenant at the bedsits hid in a cupboard for two days after police sealed off the suspected murder scene.
Sebastian Gieras, who lived on the same floor as Joele Leotta and Alex Galbiati, told the court he was cleaning the bathroom on the night of the incident when he saw a group of men outside the Italians’ door.
He said one of them was carrying a butter knife and asked him who lived in the room but Mr Gieras told the man he didn't know and returned to his room.
The court heard Mr Gieras was in the cupboard when his brother, Artur, was arrested.
The witness was wanted by police for a bail warrant which was later withdrawn.
He was discovered and arrested by officers on Tuesday, October 22. Sebastian and Artur Gieras were later ruled out of the investigation.
Amrat Gohil owns the bedsit in Lower Stone Street, Maidstone, where Joele Leotta was fatally injured.
Landlord Amrat Gohil gave evidence at the trial on Tuesday. He told jurors he confronted tenants at his property in Lower Stone Street after receiving a complaint about noise.
Mr Gohil said he paid a lunchtime visit to the bedsits above Vesuvius on Saturday, October 19, last year –the day before the fatal incident – and switched off loud music playing in one of the attic rooms where Gelezinis lived.
He called 999 when another tenant, known as Monkey, began to “shout at him” before leaving the property.
The prosecution claims the four defendants attacked the two Italians because they believed they were responsible for the complaint, but it was actually another tenant who lodged the grievance.
The trial continues.

The marina and yachting industry in the Middle East is currently witnessing strong growth potential. According to Simon Arrol, Director of Homeport, the region's leading marina and yachting operations firm, new marina developments in Dubai are estimated to add 4,500 marina berths to the existing capacity in the next five years.
"With the current rise in waterfront developments, we estimate that in the next ten years there is potential for an explosive growth in yacht ownership, resulting in greater demand for marinas in the region," said Arrol.
Currently, the UAE has seven marinas and boating clubs with an additional four scheduled to be built in the near future. Kuwait currently sports seven marinas and boating clubs and another marina is due to be constructed in the near future. Dubai is the undoubted centre of the Gulf leisure industry with an increasing number of boat builders serving the Gulf and the European markets. While the main focus for leisure boating in the region is on fishing and diving, cruising on larger yachts is gaining in popularity and there are nearly 1,500 larger leisure yachts in the Gulf region mainly in Kuwait and the UAE.
Furthermore Dubai is now one of the world's leading tourist destinations with its main emphasis on a marina lifestyle. Massive waterfront projects in Dubai and the surrounding region have generated an increased demand for leisure boats, equipment and associated services. Due to the significant rise in the number of marinas and related activity currently witnessed in Dubai, Homeport (), has announced its plans to relocate to Dubai Maritime City, as part of its overall strategy of laying added emphasis on the Middle East.
"Homeport will greatly benefit from the professional and world-class environment of Dubai Maritime City that will provide them with improved contact with boat and equipment builders, repairs and event organizers, all activities that are key to the growth of yachting and marinas," said Amer Ali, Project Manager of Dubai Maritime City.
Homeport specializes in the design and management of marinas and provides consultancy to architects and property developers on the best way to design a marina and to integrate it aesthetically and operationally with the waterfront property. Apart from investing in marina, they also manage the marina's Capitainerie services such as yacht charter, brokerage, sea school, insurance and boat repairs.
Dubai Maritime City will be a 216-hectare manmade peninsula, and will create an iconic, multidimensional maritime centre providing a unique world-class environment for the global maritime community. Dubai Maritime City is headed by Sultan Ahmed Bin Sulayem, Executive Chairman.

Attack of the 50 Foot Woman is a 1958 American..
Trivia:.
Yvette Vickers had a close call when filming her character’s death scene. A large nail on one of the boards from the fallen debris stood dangerously close to her head.
The giant bald space alien is played by Michael Ross. He can also be spotted playing the bartender.
The movie’s poster was as #8 of “The 25 Best Movie Posters Ever” by Premiere.
According to Yvette Vickers, the suggestion for her sexy dance came from Frank Chase, brother of dancer Barrie Chase, who played the deputy Charlie.
Director Nathan Juran insisted on being billed as “Nathan Hertz” (Hertz was Juran’s middle name), apparently because he was embarrassed by this film’s low budget and poor quality.Officials Charged With Taking Federal School Funds
SEPTEMBER 11, 2007
The lieutenant governor and a territorial senator of American Samoa have been federally charged with fraud, bribery and obstruction of justice for taking nearly one million federal dollars intended for schools.
American Samoa is an unincorporated U.S. territory in the South Pacific Ocean that doesnâ??t have a federal court but receives plenty of federal tax dollars for numerous programs, including schools. Prosecutors say that Lieutenant Governor Aitofele Sunia and Territorial Senator Tini Yuen illegally steered $775,000 in public school funds to companies they owned.
The corrupt Samoan officials created bogus paperwork to give the false appearance that a huge school project was instead dozens of small projects that each cost less than the $10,000 that requires competitive bidding. Then they bribed the two public officials in charge of enforcing procurement laws to approve the fraudulent scheme.
Those two officials, Samoaâ??s chief procurement officer and Education Department director, are already serving prison sentences for their role in the scheme that has cheated schools out of hundreds of thousands of dollars.
The procurement officer (Faâ??au Seumanutafa) is serving a 30-month sentence and was ordered to pay a $61,000 fine and the education director (Kerisano Sataua) was sent to jail for eight months and was fined $85,000. The lieutenant governor and senator face 20 years in prison and fines of up to half a million dollars.Let me tell you, when a perfectionist starts to learn cursive it is fun times.
“Augh! Look at this y! It’s horrible! Look at how messed up it is!”
“No, Alex. I’m not going to look at your messed up y. Finish the row, and then circle the y you like the best, and I’ll look at that one.”
“Z is hard too! Miss Amy says that she never mastered cursive z. Do you think I’ll ever be able to get it?”
“If you could write cursive letters the first time you tried, you wouldn’t need a cursive book. Just keep practicing and then circle your best z.”
And miraculously? This totally works. Circling the best letter, which I guess implicitly means disowning all the less-perfect ones, seems to shut off the perfectionist critic in her head. It keeps her practicing.
She can’t wait to be able to use cursive all the time:
Oh I love that response! I’m going to have to try that…K
What a great idea! “Circle the one you like best.”
I’m going to try to figure out ways to incorporate that into my own life.
It may help your little perfectionist (and “Miss Amy,” presumably his teacher) to be aware of this: jstor.org/stable/pdfplus/27542168.pdf

LANSING, MI — In the minds of new business owners Paul Bussard and Paul Fox, wine is something everyone can enjoy.
With their new business, P Squared Wine Bar, the two Pauls hope to introduce downtown Lansing to wine in a non-intimidating fashion, providing a casual atmosphere and wines for every price range.
The bar and restaurant opened this week at 107 Washington Square South and offers 100 types of wines, including 20 Michigan varieties. A number of food options also are available.
Fox and Bussard, both Lansing natives, are passionate about wine and saw an opportunity to create a market for their passion in the heart of the downtown.
"We've been lovers of wine for quite a few years," Bussard said. "We think we can carve a niche. Everyone we've talked to seems really excited that we're doing this."
Bussard traces his own love of wine back to his second Iraq deployment while serving in the U.S. National Guard. When he was in Iraq, Bussard read a lot of material about wine and became interested in the history behind the drink.
"I couldn't drink it at the time, so I learned about it," he said.
Under Huntington National Bank's Small Business Associate's Patriot Express program, Bussard received a $120,000 loan to help get P Squared up and running as he transfers into civilian life, according to a press release from the bank.
Bussard and Fox have backgrounds in business and management, so once the idea was tossed around to get a wine bar up and running, it never went away. For more than a year, they've gone through exhaustive preparation to make sure their business will succeed, Fox said.
"Between the two of us, we have the confidence and skill set to make this a reality," Fox said.
Fox and Bussard consider themselves two normal guys who happened upon wine and loved it, so they plan on marketing it to everyone — not just wine snobs.
To help accomplish this, P Squared features several electronic menus on customized iPads that help customers as they determine which wines might suit their tastes. The iPads categorize the wine into various groupings such as price, flavor, region or complementary foods and allows customers to order right from their menus.
Fox said social media also has played a key factor in their business model. From the get-go, they've placed emphasis on their website and Twitter account to hype the business even before it opened.
Now that P Squared is open for business, Bussard said he's hopeful that hype translates into a prosperous new business in downtown Lansing where people can get together and enjoy wine for what it is — a delicious drink with a lot of history.
"I love to talk wine with people and get into the dorky, science side of it," he said. "But even if people don't know anything about it, we want them to try. It's fun, and as long as it tastes good to you and you enjoy it, that's all that matters."
P Squared Wine Bar is open from 11 a.m. to midnight Monday through Thursday, 11 a.m. to 1 a.m. on Friday and noon to 1 a.m. on Saturday.A strong cloth tape for general purpose bandaging and whenever extra strength is needed. Hospital brand Durapore Surgical Tape.

According to the company's blog, a Cubify employee used a CAT scan machine to make a model of his own face, then used additive manufacturing to bring the hyper-realistic mask to life.
"The beginning of the freakiest Halloween costume ever?" the blog asks. "We can only hope!"
3D printing has applications that go far beyond mere scare factor, however. The ability of 3D printers to accurately recreate the natural imperfections in skin have huge implications for the medical field, because the technology could be used to create extremely realistic prosthetics for victims of disfiguring accidents.
Medical firms are already developing 3D printing techniques that will be used to fit wounded soldiers with new limbs, and 3D printed models have also been used to develop artificial joints perfectly tailored to a person's unique bone structure.Monday, April 28, 2008

Morris: Everybody loves to imagine what these stories are. You see something really, really, really bad--and I would put Abu Ghraib in that category--and the natural human tendency is to imagine that these people are beyond the pale, they're not like you and me, they're in some deep sense subhuman. And on the flip side, there are the real heroes, who stood up and said, "I won't allow this to happen." Now, I'm not saying that there aren't people who are beyond the pale, and that there aren't real heroes. I just think that the story is far, far more complex.Again, you can read the rest here. And for the visually inclined, here's a brief film clip of the director talking. Since he was leaning back in his chair, his shirt is crisply lit and his face is grainy, with a Francis Bacon-like swirling of reds and purples. (Fun fact: as a young man, Morris studied the cello with Nadia Boulanger, as did his frequent collaborator Philip Glass. Is she the mother of American minimalism? Aaron Copland studied with Boulanger as well, and I've always thought that his 1924 Symphony for Organ and Orchestra had a distinctly minimalist shimmer to it.) Anyway, here's Errol:
For both the Left and Right, the bad apples are these odd constructions. Everybody has an investment in seeing them as bad. Part of what the movie is trying to do--and I think it's a risky thing to do--is to show people struggling with a kind of nightmare.
Propeller: The nightmare of Abu Ghraib itself?
Morris: Yes. I mean, the place was crazy. They put a prison in the middle of the Sunni Triangle! One of the standards of the Geneva Convention is that you do not put prisoners in a war zone, where they can be killed. You put them behind your own lines. Abu Ghraib, setting aside all its associations with Saddam's regime, was in a place that was just dangerous. There were two military intelligence officers who lost their lives that September during a mortar attack. Prisoners were killed, too. It was a dangerous place, ill-supplied, understaffed, with people pouring in from random sweeps. People coming into the place were unable to get out, due to endless bureaucratic rigmarole. For all intents and purposes, we were running a concentration camp in the middle of the Sunni Triangle. Congratulations!

About Modern Australian Food
The term “Modern Australian” was first coined in 1996 in the Sydney Morning Herald Good Food Guide. This style of cooking has variously been known as international, mod-oz, fusion or contemporary and denotes a culinary culture that is the result of a collision of cuisines from around the world.
Modernettes on a tour of the Orient. Chinese restaurants can still be found in almost every Australian town, many serving Westernised dishes such as sweet and sour pork and beef with black bean. As the Australian palette has developed, so too has the complexity of these Chinese dishes.
The second great culinary revolution came post WWII, with massive European immigration in the 1950s and ‘60s. As the Mediterranean immigrants poured in, so too did spaghetti, youvetsi and baba ganoush.
Australia’s liberation from a traditional food culture of its own has allowed innovation to flourish in our kitchens, however it is important to note that “Modern Australian” cuisine is not far removed from other International food cultures such as those in America.
The fusion food found in fine dining restaurants today often combines Asian and European traditions, cooking styles and ingredients. It is found in some of the best restaurants all over the world.

CHU-SHAMO 中軍鶏
The medium weight class of the Shamo breed
O-Shamo Page One / O-Shamo Page Two / Chu-Shamo
Firstly, names need to be explained, as they can be confusing. Although not a translation of the word, “Shamo” can be understood to mean “Game bird from Japan”. Therefore Ko Shamo means miniature game, not miniature version of the large fowl. Nankin Shamo means Game bird from Nankin. [The Japanese characters for “Shamo” can also be translated as “Gunkei”, hence the strange name of the Yamato game bird.]
The word SHAMO on its own refers to the large fowl, but that can be further divided into O Shamo (large size) and Chu Shamo (medium size). Both of these are the same breed, which comes in a variety of weights – all above 3kg (nearly 7lbs) being correct.
An extract from an article written in 1990
by Julia Keeling:
With any breed of animal or bird which was originally bred for a specific purpose but later developed for exhibition, certain attributes unimportant to their performance take on special significance. Exhibitors must be wary, when trying to achieve these points, that they are not exaggerated so much in importance that the true working type is lost (as in Scottish Terriers or English Bulldogs for example).
An Asian Game exhibitor must aim for certain eye, leg, and feather colour, angle of back and wing, stance etc, which have little bearing on working ability, but which define it as that particular breed.
Birds still bred for their original purpose and legitimately fought in Asia, South America and other parts of the world do not, of course have to adhere to this rigid standard of excellence, their excellence is tested in quite another way, and consequently they are not homogeneous in type or colour.
However, for a breed to be shown and judged, a standard must be written for the guidance of breeders and judges alike. Ideally a showbird should be correct in all the show points, but still possess all its original characteristics - temperament does affect carriage, and is certainly involved in 'type’.
SHAMO STANDARD
(current in Britain.
This illustration above from the book KAEMPFER UND ZWERGKAEMPFER DER WELT) caused quite a stir amoung gamefowl enthusiasts and its blood began many excellent Shamo lines in Germany.
Black/red is the most common colour seen. (The ‘red’ may be any shade from yellow to dark red, with wheaten or partridge females which can be any shade from cream to dark brown, with or without dark markings).
My 13 year-old son above with a wheaten Shamo hen. This bird has kept the elegant, slender form of her first year and has given young that, so far, have this more slender form. Shamo usually change physiologically in their second year, becoming more massive, as well as developing the pronouced points of heavy eyebrows, more fleshy faces and spurs..]

The following morning around 5 am, Angad and Kripa headed off to their honeymoon (well for them it seemed like a journey to hell) via car. It was a long journey hence they decided it would be a wise idea if they left home early. They both sat in the car quietly. Angad concentrated on driving while Kripa looked uninterested, looking out the window and resting her eyes every now and then. She still couldn't believe she was married. She loved her father immensely and she was aware of how she had taken him for granted at many times. Being the only child, she was showered with unconditional love by her father. Her father tried his best not to make her miss the presence of her mother at all while she was growing up. All the love and attention from had started to spoil her which made her father apprehensive and wary of her future. She was 22 year old who had graduated a year ago but did nothing that seemed like she wanted a career ahead. She had been sitting at home, lazing around and going out whenever her heart desired. When he received the proposal for Kripa's wedding from his best friend for their son Angad, he was more than elated. It was like God had answered his prayers. According to him, this was the best way to bring Kripa back on track and sort her life out forever. Being a single dad wasn't easy for him. On top of that, he was a highly successful business man. He's been exhausted most of his life as he juggled between Kripa and business but he made sure Kripa never lacked his presence in her life.
Kripa being head strong and stubborn would have never agreed for this wedding, but however rough and tough she seemed, she was an emotional sucker from within. Her father knew that if Kripa's mother was alive, she would have wanted her to settle down. Her father mentioned this to Kripa aur bas pighal gayi! She couldn't see her father so helpless, and that too because of her. Seeing her father pleading her to get married for the sake of her late mother made her realise what a carefree daughter she had been, always thought of herself and not about the happiness of her father. She had taken her father for granted and she wanted to give something in return to him. She agreed to get married not whole-heartedly. Her father, being her father of course was aware of how mischievous Kripa can be and her agreeing to get married can spring many surprises in the future. He made her promise upon himself that she would try and make this marriage work out. Kripa was now binded by this promise that she could not break at any cost.
As for Angad, well he was a usual guy who would go club and spend his time with friends and not to forget girls. He was a 24 year old who had two degrees in his favour. It was about time he lived his life to the fullest. He seemed like a carefree person, which he was, but he respected and valued relationships very much. He knew the importance of marriage and would be totally committed when he gets married. But that was a reason why he didn't want to get married. He was not ready to commit himself to anyone as yet. He wanted to live his life and of course, the hot single girls out there were too tempting for him to even think about getting married. His parents were worried about him, especially his mother. He didn't want her only son, who she boar in her womb for nine months to end up in the gutter one day due to his carefree lifestyle. What made things worse for her was Angad's straight no answers to her. This was the limit for her. She made up her mind that she would not utter a single word to Angad until he changes his decision. Angad cared about her and was desperate for his mother to speak to him again. He thought that maybe if he gave her some space, maybe she'll start to talk to him again. Little did he know that she was on a hunger strike too. After two days of rigorous fasting she was rushed to the hospital after having blacked out at home. Angad was shaken by this incident. His mother was in this state all because of him. His dad finally intervened in this matter and being the disciplinarian that he is ordered Angad to get married to his friend's daughter. Angad had no option but to agree. This made his mother extremely happy and he could see the glint of hope within her eyes. He promised her that he wouldn't let her down.
Kripa looked out of the car window thinking about life ahead. She glanced towards Angad and studied his face. She thought to herself, 'socha tha ki koi shehzaada se shaadi hogi…lagta hai ab is langoor se hi kaam chalaana hoga!' She closed her eyes thinking about how it would have been like to have chosen someone of her choice for her marriage.
There was an assembly where the swayamvar of Princess Kripa was being held. Around 20-50 young men were seated in rows, waiting for Princess Kripa to come and make one of them her prince. They all were around the height of 6 feet and were extremely gorgeous (may I add, all had 6 pac abs) dressed in orange dhotis and nothing else but gold ornaments around their biceps and crown adorning their heads.
Her highness Princess Kripa was seated on her thrown that was at the top of the staircase. She was draped with a saree tightly around her body that accentuated her tall curvaceous body. Like a princess, she too was loaded with jewellery on her body and an elegant crown on her head. She descended down the stairs with a garland made of flowers in her hands. She came down the stairs and inspected each man one by one, walking past them, looking at them, waiting for a spark to happen. After reviewing the 50th prince, Kripa lost hope and turned to go back to her thrown in disappointment. Just as she turned, she heard someone approach. A new prince had arrived at the swayamvar. He stood their waiting by the door. A tall 6 foot 2 guy with a muscular frame and hazel eyes. Kripa ran towards him in slow motion with the garland swinging from left to right in her hands. She approached the prince and was about to put the garland around his neck when she realised that this prince was none other than Angad.
Kripa woke up with a gasp. She could not believe this. She was dreaming about her fairy tale wedding…then where the hell did Angad come from? Angad looked at her curiously and asked, " kya hua? Tum theek ho?" She looked at him sharply replying sarcastically, "I'm married to you, of course I'm fine!" She looked out the window and thought to herself 'yeh langoor sapno mein bhi mera peecha nahin chodta! Uff!'
Angad looked at her and thought, 'haan haan, jaise mere bhaag khul gaye is psycho se shaadi karke'.
Angad could see that she was dozing off again and mischief was cropping into his mind. He blasted the stereo to full volume making Kripa wake up in a jerk.
"Abey oye! Dimaag ke saath kaan bhi kharaab ho gaya hai kya?" Kripa asked in anger.
"Haan, well dimaag mere shaadi ke mandap mein hi kharaab ho gaya tha, jab tumse shaadi hui. Aur jab dimaag hi kharaab ho gaya hai, kyun na kaan bhi kharaab kar doon".
Kripa looked at him in disbelief. He had lost his nut to screw his brains with. To annoy Kripa even further he started to drive the car fast and awkwardly. This had started to freak Kripa out and she insisted that he stops this at once. But Angad was hell bent to drive fast.
"Angad gaadi roko"
"Kyun? Humein aaj hi wahaan jaana hai…slow jaayenge to agle hafte tak nahin jaa paayenge"
"Angad, I insist, gaadi roko", she screamed.
"Aha! Nothing doing princess!"
"ANGAD PLEASE GAADI ROKO. MERI MAA AISE HI MARI THI!"
Hearing this he pressed the brakes instantly, stopping the car. "Kya?"
She stared ahead of her feeling numb and replied, "haan. Main 6 saal ki thi. Main beemaar thi isliye unhone mujhe Aaya ke paas rakha tha meri dekhbaal karne ke liye. They had gone for a conference in Pune. Woh jaldi mere paas aane ki koshish kar rahe the. Papa lost control of the car and crashed into an oncoming truck. Papa bach gaye, lekin maa bach nahin paayi".
Angad looked at her feeling extremely guilty. He had taken the joke a bit too far.
Kripa looked through the side window and said, "ab chalna nahin hai kya?" trying to cover up her pain. He started the car and continued to drive. He didn't know how to speak to her now, especially when she was in this type of mood. He had tried breaking the ice with her on several occasions in the past few days but to no amend. He tried to apologise to her about what he had just done. "Kripa… I'm…I'm sorry".
Kripa turned her head towards him instantly. "Kya…kya kaha tumne?"
"I'm sorry Kripa. Main mazaak kar raha tha. You see, tum theek hi kehti ho. Mujh mein koi samajh hai nahin. Main stupid hoon, duffer hoon, langoor hoon".
Hearing 'langoor' she laughed and replied, "haan, that I have to agree with".
They both continued to laugh and tried to speak to each other cordially for once.
"I'm sorry as well. I guess I've been quite difficult in the past few days".
"Oh yes! That you have been" Angad winked at her.
"Hey! I'm being nice, don't screw your chances!"
"Ok as you say Princess!"
"Princess? What's with you calling me that?" asked Kripa.
"Well I don't see you appreciating it if I called you a wicked witch now, would you?"
"OYE!" They both laughed and continued to joke about the events that had taken place in the past few days, such as the suhaagraat incident which neither of them would ever be able to forget.
Finally about 10 am they reached their villa in Goa. As soon as they reached their bedroom, the first thing they did was jumped on the bed for a quick nap. They had been knackered with the long drive to the place. This was just the beginning. They wondered how they'll survive seven days in this so called honeymoon.

Plaintiff brings this shareholder class action on behalf of himself and all other public shareholders of American Commercial Lines Inc. (“American” or the “Company”) against the Company’s Board of Directors (the “Board” or the “Individual Defendants”), Finn Holding Corporation (“Finn”), Platinum Equity, LLC (“Platinum”) and Finn Merger Corporation (the “Merger Sub”) (Finn, Platinum and the Merger Sub are collectively referred to as the “Platinum”)(collectively referred to as “Defendants”), for breaches of fiduciary duties in conjunction with the proposed buyout and acquisition of American by Finn, an affiliate of 1 Platinum. Under the terms of a definitive merger agreement announced on October 18, 2010, American shareholders other than GVI Holdings, Inc. (“GVI”) will receive $33.00 in cash for each share of American common stock they hold (the “Proposed Acquisition”). If the transaction closes before the proposed closed date of December 31, 2010, GVI will receive $31.25 in cash for each share of American common stock it holds. The transaction is valued at approximately $777 million. 2. GVI is American’s largest shareholder, owning approximately 25.26% of American’s outstanding common stock. GVI has entered into a Voting Agreement in support of the Proposed Acquisition. Additionally, the Individual Defendants as well as Company officers owning approximately 4% of American common stock have likewise unanimously pledged their votes in support of the Proposed Acquisition. As a whole, close to 30% of American common stock has already been pledged in support of the Proposed Acquisition. 3. If the Proposed Acquisition is approved, the Individual Defendants will have breached their fiduciary duties of loyalty and due care by, inter alia, agreeing to sell American without first taking steps to ensure that Plaintiff and Class members (defined below) would obtain adequate and fair consideration under the circumstances. As alleged herein, Platinum aided and abetted the Individual Defendants’ breaches of fiduciary duty. 4. Plaintiff seeks to enjoin the Proposed Acquisition or, alternatively, to recover damages in the event that the Proposed Acquisition is consummated. The consideration offered to American’s public shareholders is grossly unfair and inadequate. 2 THE PARTIES 5. Plaintiff Leonard Becker is, and has been at all relevant times a shareholder of American. 6.

The Company’s common stock is traded on NASDAQ under the symbol “ACLI.” As of October 20, 2010, the Company had approximately 12,830,000 shares of common stock outstanding. 7. Defendant Clayton Yeutter, (“Yeutter”) has served as Chairman of the Board of Directors of the Company since January 11, 2005. 8. Defendant Richard Huber, (“Huber”) has been a Director of the Company since January 11, 2005.

Defendant Emmanuel Rouvelas (“Rouvelas”) has been a Director of the Company since January 11, 2005. 11. Defendant Michael Ryan, (“Ryan”) serves as a Director of the Company. Ryan was named President and Chief Executive Officer of American effective March 1, 2008. Prior to that, he served as Senior Vice President of Sales and Marketing since coming to American in November 2005. 3 12. Defendant Christopher Weber, (“Rosenthal”) has been a Director of the Company since January 11, 2005. 13. Individual Defendants Clayton Yeutter, Richard Huber, Nils Larsen, Emmanuel Rouvelas, Michael Ryan and Christopher Weber are, and at all times relevant hereto have been, directors of American, and are referred to herein as “Individual Defendants” or “Director Defendants.” 14. The Director Defendants, by reason of their corporate directorships and/or executive positions, are fiduciaries to and for the Company’s stockholders, which fiduciary relationship required them to exercise their best judgment, and to act in a prudent manner and in the best interests of the company’s stockholders. 15. Each Director Defendant herein is sued individually, as a conspirator and aider and abettor, as well as in their capacity as an officer and/or director of the Company, and the liability of each arises from the fact that he has engaged in all or part of the unlawful acts, plans, schemes, or transactions complained of herein. 16. Defendant Platinum Equity, LLC (“Platinum”) is a global M&A&O firm specialized in mergers, acquisitions and operations of companies that provide mission-critical products, services and solutions in diverse industries. Platinum is headquartered in Los Angeles, California. 17. Defendant Finn Holding Corporation is an affiliate of Platinum and a Delaware corporation. 18. Defendant Finn Merger Corporation (the “Merger Sub”) is a Delaware corporation and a wholly-owned subsidiary of Finn. 4 SUBSTANTIVE ALLEGATIONS 19. On October 18, 2010, American announced that it would be acquired by an affiliate of Platinum, Finn Holding Corporation, in a transaction valued at $777 million. The press release states in relevant part: JEFFERSONVILLE, IN--(Marketwire - 10/18/10) - American Commercial Lines Inc. (NASDAQ:ACLI - News) ( 5. 24. The Company’s recent financial performance and analyst expectations establish that the Finn Defendant’s offer is woefully inadequate. 25. Since dropping to a year-to-date low of $15.24 per share on February 1, 2010, American’s stock has seen its value steadily increase. Over the past six months alone, American stock has risen in value by greater than 40%. Of even greater significance, since June 9, 2010 American stock is up over 63%. Moreover, as recently as October 15, 2010, American common stock traded at $33.67 per share – above the transaction price. 26. The upward trajectory of American’s stock price is likely to continue. As the Company stated in its most recent 10K, “[h]istorically [American] generates stronger financial results in the last half of the year, driven by demand from the grain harvest and the impact of that demand on grain and spot shipping rates.” 27. On October 11, 2010, BB&T Capital Markets upgraded its opinion of American stock from “hold” to “buy” and at least five other analysts have graded American as a “strong buy” in the last two months alone. 28. Additionally, at least one analyst has set a target price of $50.00 per share for American common stock. 6 29. Commenting on the deal, Alex Brand, a stock analyst with Stephens Inc., stated, “[s]hareholders might find the $33 per share price too low,” Brand further noted that Platinum’s offer was below the stock’s closing price of $33.31 on Friday October 15, 2010, which is “very unusual” for a company that is not teetering on bankruptcy. Brand said the $33 price is a “very attractive” deal for Platinum. 30. Brand stated that the deal is being driven by Sam Zell [financier of GVI Holdings], which owns a quarter of the Company, “This is basically his deal, so the question is, will the other 75% of shareholders vote in favor of the deal? I think what the stock is telling you today is, not at $33.” 31. In an article in the Indiana Economic Digest, Morgan Keegan analyst Chaz Jones agreed, saying the offer “likely understates the value,” of the Company. Jones added, “We feel that a higher valuation is likely warranted for a long-term buyer of American, we can’t speculate on whether private equity players will feel the same way.” 32. Echoing these sentiments, American’s stock opened for trading on October 21, 2010 at $35.10, well above the $33 offer price and the third straight day since the announcement of the Proposed Acquisition that the stock opened above $33 and at a price greater than what it closed at the day prior- a strong indication that those following the stock believe it to be worth more than the offer price of $33 per share. 33. Clearly, based on the above, the Proposed Acquisition will allow Platinum to purchase American at an unfairly low price while availing itself of American’s significant value and upside or long-term potential. 34. Moreover, the Merger Agreement contains certain provisions that unfairly favor Platinum by making an alternative transaction either prohibitively expensive or otherwise 7 impossible. For example, the Merger Agreement contains a termination fee provision that requires American to pay $14,000,000.00 to Platinum if the Merger Agreement is terminated under certain circumstances. 35. The termination fee payable under this provision will make the Company that much more expensive to acquire for potential purchasers, while resulting in a corresponding decline in the amount of consideration payable to American shareholders. 36. The Merger Agreement also contains a “no shop” provision that restricts American from considering alternative acquisition proposals by, inter alia, constraining American’s ability to solicit or communicate with potential acquirers or consider their proposals. Specifically, the provision prohibits the Company from soliciting any alternative proposal after a brief defined time period, but permits the Board to consider a “bona fide written Acquisition Proposal” if it constitutes or is reasonably calculated to lead to a “Superior Proposal” as defined in the Merger Agreement. 37. Moreover, the Agreement further reduces the possibility of a topping offer from an unsolicited purchaser. Here, Defendants agreed to provide Platinum information in order to match any other offer, thus providing Platinum access to the unsolicited bidder’s financial information and giving Platinum the ability to top the superior offer. Thus, a rival bidder is not likely to emerge with the cards stacked so much in favor of Platinum. 38. Accordingly, the Company’s true value is compromised by the consideration offered in the Proposed Acquisition and the Proposed Acquisition is the product of the Board’s breaches of fiduciary duty, aided and abetted by Platinum. 8 THE INDIVIDUAL DEFENDANTS’ FIDUCIARY DUTIES 39. In any situation where the directors of a publicly traded corporation undertake a transaction that will result in either a change in corporate control or a break-up of the corporation’s assets, the directors have an affirmative fiduciary obligation to act in the best interests of the company’s shareholders, including the duty to obtain maximum value under the circumstances. To diligently comply with these duties, the directors may not take any action that: (a) adversely affects the value provided to the corporation’s shareholders; (b) will discourage or inhibit alternative offers to purchase control of the corporation or its assets; (c) contractually prohibits them from complying with their fiduciary duties; and/or (d) will provide the directors, executives or other insiders with preferential treatment at the expense of, or separate from, the public shareholders, and place their own pecuniary interests above those of the interests of the company and its shareholders. 40. In accordance with their duties of loyalty and good faith, the Individual Defendants, as directors and/or officers of American, are obligated to refrain from: (a) participating in any transaction where the directors’ or officers’ loyalties are divided; (b) participating in any transaction where the directors or officers are entitled to receive a personal financial benefit not equally shared by the public shareholders of the corporation; and/or (c) unjustly enriching themselves at the expense or to the detriment of the public shareholders. 9 41. Plaintiff alleges herein that the Individual Defendants, separately and together, in connection with the Proposed Acquisition, violated, and are violating, the fiduciary duties they owe to Plaintiff and the other public shareholders of American, including their duties of loyalty, good faith, candor, and due care. As a result, Plaintiff and Class members will not receive adequate or fair or value for their American common stock in the Proposed Acquisition. 42. As a result of the Individual Defendants’ breaches of fiduciary duty, the Company’s public shareholders will not receive adequate or fair value for their common stock in the Proposed Acquisition. CLASS ACTION ALLEGATIONS 43. Plaintiff brings this action individually and as a class action on behalf of all holders of American common stock who are being and will be harmed by the Defendants’ actions, described herein (the “Class”). Excluded from the Class are Defendants and any person, firm, trust, corporation or other entity related to or affiliated with any Defendant 44. This action is properly maintainable as a class action because, inter alia: (a) The Class is so numerous that joinder of all members is impracticable. American’s stock is publicly traded on the NASDAQ and there are approximately 12.8 million outstanding shares. Plaintiff believes that there are hundreds if not thousands of holders of such shares. Moreover, the holders of these shares are geographically dispersed throughout the United States; (b) There are questions of law and fact which are common to the Class including, inter alia: (i) whether the Individual Defendants have breached their fiduciary duties to plaintiff and the Class by agreeing to an acquisition transaction at a price that is inadequate and is not the fair value that could be obtained under the circumstances; (ii) whether Platinum aided and abetted the Individual Defendants’ breaches of fiduciary duty; and (iii) whether the 10 Class is entitled to injunctive relief and/or damages as a result of the wrongful conduct committed by Defendants; (c) Plaintiff is committed to prosecuting this action and has retained competent counsel experienced in litigation of this nature. The claims of Plaintiff are typical of the claims of the other members of the Class and Plaintiff has the same interests as the other members of the Class. Accordingly, Plaintiff is an adequate representative of the Class and will fairly and adequately protect the interests of the Class; (d) The prosecution of separate actions by individual members of the Class would create the risk of inconsistent or varying adjudications with respect to individual members of the Class which would establish incompatible standards of conduct for Defendants, or adjudications with respect to individual members of the Class which would, as a practical matter, be dispositive of the interests of the other members not parties to the adjudications or substantially impair or impede their ability to protect their interests; and (e) Defendants have acted, or refused to act, on grounds generally applicable to, and causing injury to, the Class and, therefore, preliminary and final injunctive relief on behalf of the Class as a whole is appropriate. FIRST COUNT Breach of Fiduciary Duty against the Individual Defendants 45. Plaintiff incorporates each and every allegation set forth above as if fully set forth herein. 46. As alleged herein, Defendants have initiated a process to sell American that undervalues the Company. Indeed, the stock price has risen over 60% since June 2010 and in the days leading up to the announcement, was trading above the deal price. The Individual 11 Defendants are privy to non-public information concerning the Company that the public stock shareholders are not; thus, there exists a fiduciary duty to protect these shareholders and ensure the cash out process entails both fair dealing and a fair price. Defendants have failed to sufficiently inform themselves of American’s value, or have disregarded the true value of the Company. Furthermore, the Individual Defendants have agreed to onerous deal protection devices that discourage any alternate acquirer from coming forward in the face of the knowledge that Platinum can block the purchase. 47. As such, unless the Individual Defendants’ conduct is enjoined by the Court, they will continue to breach their fiduciary duties to Plaintiff and the other members of the Class, and will further a process that inhibits the maximization of shareholder value and the disclosure of material information. 48. Plaintiff and the members of the Class have no adequate remedy at law. SECOND COUNT Aiding and Abetting the Board’s Breaches of Fiduciary Duty Against Platinum 49. Plaintiff incorporates each and every allegation set forth above as if fully set forth herein. 50. Platinum knowingly assisted the Individual Defendants’ breaches of fiduciary duty in connection with the Proposed Acquisition, which, without such aid, would not have occurred. In connection with discussions regarding the Proposed Acquisition, Platinum secured certain deal protection provisions which unfairly inhibit the advancement of alternative proposals. In addition, Platinum obtained sensitive non-public information concerning American’s operations and thus had the advantage to acquire the Company at an unfair price. 12 51. As a result of this conduct, Plaintiff and the other members of the Class have been and will be damaged in that they have been and will be prevented from obtaining a fair price for their shares. 52. Plaintiff and the members of the Class have no adequate remedy at law. WHEREFORE, Plaintiff demands injunctive relief, in his favor and in favor of the Class, and against the Defendants, as follows: A. Declaring that this action is properly maintainable as a class action, certifying Plaintiff as Class representative and certifying his counsel as class counsel; B. Temporarily and permanently enjoining Defendants, their agents, counsel, employees and all persons acting in concert with them from consummating the Proposed Transaction; C. To the extent the Proposed Transaction is consummated before entry of this Court’s judgment, rescinding it and setting it aside or awarding rescissory damages; D. Awarding Plaintiff the costs and disbursements of this action, including reasonable attorneys’ and experts’ fees; and E. Granting such other and further relief as this Court may deem just and proper.

The possibility that Israel will be in a position to lift foreign currency controls if American Jewry succeeds in raising $75,000,000 in loans to help Israel retire its short-term obligations, was held out here today by Finance Minister Levi Eshkol in a report to the Cabinet on his trip to the United States.
Mr. Eshkol, who returned to Israel this week-end after ten days in the U. S. where he worked with Jewish leaders on the loan, said he believes American Jewry will be able to arrange the long-term laans which Israel needs. Earlier, interviewed by newsmen, he praised the efforts of the American Jews to help Israel.I need city lights defense and weaponryBattlefield?

Automation supplier invests $1.5M in expansion
A diversified maker of custom automated equipment is opening the doors to a $1.5-million expansion to meet customer demand.
JR Automation Technologies in Holland said today that it has completed the 40,000-square foot expansion, at 12688 New Holland St.
The expansion will help the company serve various industries: automotive, construction, consumer products, food processing, furniture, medical, aerospace and pharmaceutical.
The company operates three locations in Holland and offices in Stevensville, south of Benton Harbor, and Pickens, S.C.
Scot Lindemann, vice president of JR Automation Technologies, said the growth of the business is a reflection of employee dedication.
“Our business has provided solutions to allow the manufacturing industry to roar back,” Lindemann said. “Our growth is a direct result of our employees’ ability to go above and beyond to meet the changing needs of our customers in a wide variety of industries.”
Regional partner
JR Automation Technologies partnered with Lakeshore Advantage in Zeeland, the regional economic development nonprofit, to assist in the planning of the expansion project.
Bryan Jones, chief operating officer at JR Automation Technologies, said the collaboration with Lakeshore Advantage was due to the company recognizing increased demand exceeded capacity.
“We just didn’t have the space,” Jones said. “So we put together a plan for expansion with the help of Lakeshore Advantage. Their advice and connections have been invaluable.”
Jennifer Owens, president of Lakeshore Advantage, said the nonprofit was pleased to work with the company on the project.
“This company is a true regional asset providing innovative process solutions to national and international manufacturers,” Owens said.
Contractor
Lakewood Construction in Holland was selected as general contractor and contacted earlier this spring with a mandatory completion date of Aug. 5.
Dave Ash, director of sales and marketing at Lakewood Construction, said there was a bit of a relationship between Lakewood and JR Automation Technologies prior to the project.
“You always are excited about new customers, and we have done some work for JR in the past, more small interior work, and through that, we have developed a relationship and trust with each other that led to them hiring us and us partnering together for this addition,” Ash said.
Construction hurdle
With the groundbreaking around April and four months to complete the project, Lakewood Construction subcontracted Lamar Construction to help erect the steel required in the new plant.
When Lamar filed for Chapter 7 bankruptcy in July before the project was completed, Lakewood Construction’s own steel erection crew worked in the evenings and the following weekend to maintain schedule.
Some of the staff at Lamar who were working on the project were also transferred over to Lakewood Construction’s temporary payroll to finish the expansion on time.
“Our reaction to that was it was fast and furious to figure out how we are going to maintain the schedule, because every day mattered — we couldn’t afford to lose a day, let alone three or four days,” Ash said.
Despite the challenge, Ash said there was roughly only one day lost in the scramble.
JR’s Lindemann said Lakewood Construction is an example of the West Michigan culture to do the right thing.
“We could not have completed this project without Lakewood’s willingness to step in and step up,” Lindemann said.You are an Italian citizen after recognition -- NOT before.

Advocates are holding the rally — which will be held from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. — to bring attention to the plight of homeless residents throughout New Jersey. The rally will be attended by homeless advocates Sherry Rubel and Minister Steve Brigham, who led Lakewood’s homeless community known as Tent City.
“The homeless situation is growing. It’s endlessly growing, and it’s growing into the middle class,” said Rubel, who lives in South Brunswick and photographed the residents of Tent City before the community was torn down this year.
After Tent City was dismantled, about 50 or 60 of its homeless residents were given a one-year stay in hotels, but the solution is expensive and not a permanent answer to their crisis, Rubel said.
She and other homeless advocates are supporting a project that would fund small homes of 190 square feet that cost about $10,000 to construct. But zoning laws that emphasize large houses and a lack of available land block the ability for advocates to build homes for the currently homeless, Rubel said. She hopes that by rallying before the state Senate, lawmakers will agree to provide public lands for the project.
“If we had the land, we could do the rest,” Rubel said.

4751Oregon City’s offense has been running circles around its opponents in Three Rivers League girls basketball.
The Pioneers (15-2, 4-0) are averaging 84.0 points per game in league play, including a 99-point game last week against Canby in which they rewrote the school record book.
“We really like to start to click on all cylinders coming into the end of January and into February, so going into March we really have a lot of momentum and the kids are feeling good,” coach Kurt Guelsdorf said. “We’ve been scoring the basketball quite well.”
The offensive surge isn’t coming against weak competition. The team’s four league wins are against teams in the top 18 of the OSAA Class 6A power rankings: Clackamas (fourth), Canby (10th), West Linn (11th) and Lake Oswego (18th). The Pioneers are No. 2, behind South Medford.
In a 99-62 win over Canby, Oregon City shot a school-record 72 percent. The Pioneers shot 85 percent in the first half in setting a school mark for points in a half (65).
Guelsdorf said the Pioneers – ranked third in the Class 6A coaches poll -- have settled their rotation since a 69-50 loss to No. 1 South Medford in the final of the Nike Interstate Shootout on Dec. 30. The day before that game, senior wing Jade Lowery went down with a season-ending knee injury.
“We still miss Jade, there’s no doubt,” Guelsdorf said of Lowery, who averaged 9.0 points, fourth on the team. “She would be a huge piece to our puzzle. But that’s not going to happen, so we’ve had to adjust, and I think the kids have done a great job of doing that.”
Junior post Johanna Paine leads the team in scoring with a 15.2 average, followed by junior post Catelyn Preston (9.6) and junior point guard Montana Walters (9.1).

That's where the soon to be part comes in. My little jujube (her prior nickname) will be ELEVEN (it's a sign!) on September 8. So in honor of my favorite little Whovian, I am attempting Tardis shoes. They are very expensive on Etsy and other places, and I am understanding why.
Here's what I bought from the store:
Plain white canvas shoes
Acrylic paint markers (dark blue, black and white)
4 pack of foam brushes
2 bottles Tardis blue acrylic paint
1 can modge podge clear acrylic sealer
What I ordered from etsy to go with them
And various other bottles of paint I had on hand.
Additional supplies
Newspaper for work space
Cup for paint
Masking tape for taping off shoes
Q-tips for cleaning out the holes for shoelaces
Napkins/paper towels
First thing I did was PLAN. Plan, plan, plan. Plan so hard and so long that you don't even WANT to make them anymore.
I sketched the shoe from the side, and then a top view. This was helpful for planning the elements I wanted to include, as well as helping scale the elements to fit.
When you have your plan in place, set up your work space somewhere comfortable. I personally set mine up on my glass cook top. With the light right overhead, makes an excellent craft space. Tape off the shoes. I did these, not only around the bottom, but marked out the black bar on top and the white windows/sign below.
Stuffing the inside with paper towels helped it keep its shape and helped absorb any paint that seeped through. It's not captured on photo, but I also folded a piece of paper towel and pushed it between the tongue of the shoe and the shoe, to keep it clean. I have plans for it later :)
Paint away. My foam brushes were about one inch wide and just perfect for these shoes. I recommend holding the shoe from from bottom in the hand you do not write with. Don't switch hands, just turn your wrist back and forth, painting with your 'good' hand. I did up over the top lip around the shoe, but not inside. I did the placket last. Paint over the whole thing, use cotton swabs to clean out the rings and then use a napkin, kind of rolled into a fine point and carefully wipe down the placket. The paint won't come off the shoes, only the rings. Please note, these are metal, so this method may not work as well with plastic rings.
Once I was done, I slowly took off the tape and used the paint pen to go around the bottom. It worked very nicely, as the color I used was a few shades darker than Tardis blue, but still not as dark as black, so it mimicked the lines on the Tardis very nicely. Then I set them up in a high area (where Bubber could not find them) and let them dry.
The next step was removing the strip of masking tape on the top. I used a black paint pen to line and fill in. Really very easy, if not a bit of time consuming to fill in all the little white spots. As you can see, I started out trying to invert the writing with the black paint, but my E turned out funny and it went downhill from there. Never fear, I have a white fine tip paint pen for later. Oh and for the love of BANANAS, do NOT shake your paint pen ANYWHERE near the shoes. Have you ever seen a grown nerdy woman sob? It's not pretty.
Now the masking tape squares came off. I took the blue paint pen and outlined the boxes to make them look nicer and more uniform. One line midway horizontally and two evenly spaced vertical lines to make the window. Lightly outlined in black over the blue.
I used a white paint pen for the lettering and it was actually very easy with the calligraphy tip. The very edge and a steady hand worked well. It's not horribly time consuming either. The longest part is the waiting between stages. Paint drying and all that.
I painted the tongue black, for reasons you'll see later. Now you'll notice, some blue paint got on the rubber trim around the shoe. If these were for my own use, I would have sucked it up and left it. Since these are going to be a gift, presentation is key, so I went over some of the bad spots with the white paint pen. This cleaned up with appearance very nicely. I know that these are going to be WORN by a KID no less, but I feel confident in taking this step, knowing it won't last long.
I also did some lettering on the sign. You can probably make out the free. The first line says telephone (as tiny and small as it is) and the third line is 'of.' I feel like these are "ALMOST" done, save for some surprises and a clear coat spray. Allons-y!
As you can see, I added a fez and a bow tie. She is, after all 'Come along Pond,' and you can't come along Pond, unless you're with 11. Plus my niece likes him best. So :::pffffllllttttt:::
Set them outside on the back porch and sprayed per directed.

Fluffimama out <3March 23, 2013
LAS CRUCES, New Mexico - Freshman Anna Cross belted a grand slam home run and earned her first collegiate win in the circle to lead Louisiana Tech to an 8-4 win over New Mexico State in the Western Athletic Conference opener Friday night at NMSU Softball Complex.
"I thought we really stepped up tonight," said Tech head coach Mark Montgomery. "We put the loss to Stephen F. Austin at home behind us and really came out tonight and played well. We made some quick adjustments at the plate and made some great plays both offensively and defensively. There were a lot of individuals that came through. It's nice to see because this was really a team win."
Cross (1-1) got off to a shaky start in the circle, walking two batters, hitting a third and allowing two hits and two runs in the first before settling down to induce an inning ending double play ball.
"Anna struggled in the first inning," Montgomery said. "We hadn't seen that from her. She pressed a little I think. She maintained her composure and got the double play ball. Then to turn around and get an at bat and answer the bell with the grand slam ... you really saw her confidence go through the roof. That was the difference in her performance the rest of the game." all the confidence she would need the rest of the way.
All four runs were unearned as a key error by NMSU freshman third baseman Emma Adams kept the inning alive. Alayna Kipp started the rally with a one-out single followed by the fielding error by Adams on a ground ball by Janna Frandrup. Meghan Knowles then followed with a single to load the bases.
Tech continued to add to its lead in the top of the third inning. Hailey Winter and Alayna Kipp were both hit by pitches and Melanie Goff singled to load the bases with one out before Frandrup hit a bloop single over the first baseman's head to plate a run, giving Tech a 5-2 lead.
Knowles then plated a run with a fielder's choice force out at second base before Tech stole the final run of the inning on a double steal attempt that allowed Kipp to score from third before NMSU tagged Knowles for the final out of the inning. Tech led 7-2.
"NMSU is a formidable offensive team," Montgomery said. "You have to limit their offensive output and maximize yours. The fact we were able to keep adding on runs gave us some breathing room. We didn't have to press. It was very important."
Tech appeared as if it were ready to blow the game wide open in the top of the fourth inning as Dacia Hale, Cross and Amanda Krueger all singled to load the bases with no outs. Pinch hitter Claudia Cantu then hit a grounder to Adams at third that was booted for an error as Hale crossed home plate for an 8-2 Tech lead.
However, Newman pitched out of the jam, retiring the next three batters without allowing a run.
Frandrup came on in relief of Cross to start the fifth and worked a one-two-three inning thanks to a stellar defensive play at third base by Michelle Jones, who robbed the Aggies of a for-sure hit.
NMSU began the bottom of the sixth with a single and double off of Frandrup as Montgomery reentered Cross in the circle. Cross retired pinch hitter Lacey Rother on a sacrifice fly to right field, plating one run and cutting the lead to 8-3. After a walk and a bunt single loaded the bases, Cross got the second out on a force play at home.
The Aggies scored their final run of the inning and the game on a fielding error by Tech which allowed Adams to score. However, Cross then got Tehani Kaaihue to line out to Jones at shortstop to end the inning.
NMSU started the bottom of the seventh inning with a single by Staci Rodriguez before Kelsey Dodd grounded into a 4-6-3 double play. Cross got the final out on a pop up by Malena Padilla to end the game.
Cross (1-1) picked up the win, allowing two runs on five hits and five walks with one strikeout. Newman (8-8) took the loss, allowing eight runs - three earned - on 11 hits and one walk with three strikeouts.
Offensively, Tech was led by Cross (2-3, 4 RBI, 1 run), Alayna Kipp (2-3, 2 runs), Goff (2-4, 1 run), Krueger (1-4), Kristen Miles (1-3), Cantu (1 RBI), Frandrup (1-3, 1 run, 1 RBI), Knowles (1-4, 1 run, 1 RBI), Hale (1-3, 1 run) and Winter (1 run).
The two teams will play a doubleheader Saturday with game No. 1 slated for 5 p.m. CT.Coming up we have Pittsburgh.
Not only is it the 4th preseason game which is historically yawnsville, but its against a team we will be playing again in a few weeks. Things will be held closer to the vest than any preseason game in memory.
Originally I thought Blanchard would play the entire game, but he has a concussion.
Joe Webb the entire game? Will they run more than the same 4 offensive plays all game long?

Can Kazakhstan become a world power??
Source: Al Jazeera
As Egypt asks the IMF for a $4.8bn loan, we ask if it should be looking inwards at its underdeveloped financial sector.
Business & Economy, Egypt, United Kingdom
The country braces for soaring debt and another tough economic year.
Politics,WYOMING — Listen to Jena and Jason St. Clair talk about how weight loss has changed their lives:
“You just feel better. You feel more alive. You enjoy life a lot more,” Jason said.
“It’s definitely brought us a lot closer in our marriage. We’re becoming new people together,” Jena said.
While they sound like infomercial spokespersons, the St. Clairs aren’t pushing any product — except for a healthy diet, regular exercise and family support. With those tools, Jason has lost 90 pounds and Jena 70. Their 8-year-old son, Ayden, has lost 25.
The Wyoming couple plans to continue dropping pounds this year with support from a public weight-loss program that Grand Valley Health Plan will launch Saturday.
But even as they enjoy their success, Jason, 28, and Jena, 24, can’t forget the painful experience that started them on this journey.
One morning in March 2010, Jason woke up with a pinched sciatic nerve that caused severe pain in his back and leg. His doctor told him he needed surgery — but he might be able to avoid it if he lost weight. Jason weighed 368 pounds then.
Since Jena was pregnant with their second child, Jason wanted to avoid back surgery at all costs. He didn’t want to be recovering from an operation when they had a new baby in the house. It was time, he decided, to take control of his weight, which had increased steadily since high school.
A patient with Grand Valley Health Plan, he set up an appointment with a dietitian.
“My whole diet was really wrong,” he said. “I ate a lot of fast food. I’d go out for lunch, for dinner, for late-night snacks.”
He and Jena began making meals at home — mostly chicken and fish, with vegetables. Jason began eating breakfast regularly. Most days, he whipped up a shake with protein powder, oatmeal and peanut butter.
He stopped buying large quantities of snack food to eat while watching TV. He switched to sugar-free Popsicles. If he wanted a treat, he would share a 99-cent bag of Doritos with his wife.
As Jason lost weight, his back condition improved. He began walking regularly, then added weightlifting to his exercise routine.
Today, he is pain-free and medication-free. And he has managed to avoid the surgery.
“I completely beat it by weight loss,” he said.
Crucial to his success is support from his family. As resident managers of Boulder Ridge Apartments, Jason and Jena work close to home, which makes it easier for them to prepare lunches and dinners together.
They go to the YMCA five days a week, usually after dinner. They exercise and then join Ayden for a game of air hockey or basketball. Their 1-year-old, Caleb, plays in the nursery.
Jena said the daily exercise was a big adjustment. After giving birth to Caleb in October 2010, she weighed 272. Even the simplest exercise made her breathless. She felt out of place in a gym.
“The biggest thing is you have to find out what works for you,” she said.
For her, the treadmill was the best first step. She later moved on to the elliptical machine, then started running laps. Now, she takes fast-paced Zumba classes and is working out with weights.
“It’s so much of a lifestyle change,” Jena said. “But you get used to it.”
She’s become so used to it she almost craves exercise if something prevents her from working out for a few days.
TIPS
Looking to lose weight and get in shape this year?
Grand Valley Health Plan, a health maintenance organization, is inviting the public to join its 2012 Challenge. The program offers free nutrition counseling and support for weight loss, encouraging participants to make sustainable lifestyle changes. Exercise classes are included for a small fee.
Those who lose 12 pounds in 2012 are eligible to win a prize, such as a weekend trip or a health club membership.
As happy as Jason and Jena are with their progress, they feel even better about the habits they are instilling in Ayden and even Caleb.
“I’ve always been obese,” Jena said. “That was a big thing for me — breaking the cycle. I don’t want my son to grow up obese and get teased at school.”
As a third-grader, Ayden gets more leeway in his diet than his parents, but he still eats healthier than before and enjoys a much more active lifestyle with his family.
“He’s doing a lot better in school, too,” Jason said. “I think the proper nutrition can help you think a little better.”
The St. Clairs are quick to say they do get bored with what they consider a “bland diet.” They have occasional “cheat meal days,” when they go out and order whatever they want.
“It’s very important to do that, or you will wear yourself out very quickly,” Jason said. “It will drive you crazy eating the same stuff all the time.”
Jason also found support through his health plan’s weight loss program, which was open only to patients in 2011. He gets encouragement from the nutrition and fitness tips he receives by email. And he likes seeing other people’s stories and tips on the program’s Facebook page.
“It’s a nice community thing,” he said. “It really is a struggle to do it alone. Everybody gives each other a push.”
Through the Grand Valley program, Jason is eligible for a drawing that will be held Jan. 26 for the 2011 participants. The chance to win a prize, such as theater tickets, a family get-away or a TV, are a nice perk, he said.
But better health is a good reward, as well, he said.
“It’s worth every minute you spend in the gym,” he said. “You’re investing in your body for the long run. You want to make sure you’re happy and healthy for your children. You want to see your grandchildren. I think that’s very important.”
He views the back pain that set him on this path differently now.
“That pinched nerve was a gift and a curse,” he said.Monali Thakur, Shefali Shah, filmmakers Nagesh Kukunoor and Satish Kaushik during the music launch of film Lakshmi at Hard Rock Cafe in Mumbai on December 20, 2013.

Yasin co-founded the Indian Mujahideen (IM), reportedly with the support of Pakistani terror group Lashkar-e-Taiba. The IM is suspected of direct and indirect links to a series of terror attacks in India In recent years.
Yasin Bhatkal was arrested on the basis of a tip-off from the Intelligence Bureau for a case involving large amounts of fake currency.
He furnished a voter identity card that was in an assumed name with an address in Bihar.
When Kolkata police cross-checked with Bihar officials, the name and address were established as genuine.
It's likely Yasin Bhatkal had stolen someone else's identity, sources said.
After spending some months in Alipore jail, Yasin Bhatkal was released on bail.

Review
The Patmos Deception
Nick Hennessy, journalist. Carey Mathers, forensic archaeologist. Dimitri Rubinos, tour boat guide/Greek Lothario. What do these three have in common?
At first blush, not much. Nick is eking out an existence as a freelance journalist in Paris after his newspaper’s satellite office closed. Dimitri, whose tour business has suffered the same hits as Greece’s economy, struggles to keep his livelihood afloat and his desperately ill father in medical care. And Carey has just arrived in Athens, after landing the dream job of a lifetime (for a forensic archaeologist, that is). She’s been hired by the illustrious Athens Institute for Antiquities, in the wake of thefts of major Greek treasures and artifacts, to work alongside the Institute’s director to search out the thieves.
As the taxi takes Carey in the pouring rain from the airport into the city, she sees evidence everywhere of the devastation of Greece’s economic woes: gypsies, beggars, boarded-up shops and businesses. When the taxi pulls up at her destination, the Institute, Carey is shocked and appalled to discover that the gates are chained shut with Greek notices tied to them. The building’s first-floor windows are broken and barred, the fountain is empty. And Carey’s job, which she had flown halfway across the world to assume, is apparently no more.
."
So what does a doctoral student do when she’s in a foreign country, she can’t speak the local language (and can only read the ancient one), and her promised job has evaporated? Carey is fortunate, for a guardian angel in the form of a young woman from a nearby taverna (or Greek neighborhood restaurant) has seen the whole thing. Elena brings Carey and her luggage into her family’s taverna from out of the rain. She feeds her and explains what has happened to the Athens Institute for Antiquities --- at least the little that she knows. Prior to the Institute’s closing, Elena was the administrative assistant to the Institute’s director. Observing the increasing numbers of art thefts, the director had formed a plan to investigate them and had hired Carey to help. Just as this theft task force was about to begin its work, government authorities shuttered the Institute and closed it down. Carey is left with nothing to do but to find a way forward.
After Nick’s Paris stint with the Dallas Morning News ends with their French office closure and him in Paris without a job, he chases down what he hopes will be interesting stories that he can pitch to other news outlets. He meets Phyllis Karras, assistant director of the UN’s World Heritage Sites, at a chance encounter outside the Paris Sotheby’s. Over coffee she shares tips with him about black market antiquities buyers. Phyllis’ inside information breathes new life into Nick’s writing, and he’s able to stay on in France’s capital.
Now, Karras contacts Nick with the offer of a lifetime --- one that will benefit his career and the UN World Heritage Sites at the same time. It seems that there are high-level thefts of priceless icons, vases and other items of national importance to Greece. Karras’ co-workers and bosses seem concerned, but no one really wants to do anything about it. She is troubled about the possibility of an internal conspiracy, and believes that Nick is just the person to uncover the deception.
Her only concern about using Nick to follow this story is his utter lack of experience in archaeological antiquities. He tells her he knows just the person to help: Carey Mathers, his lifelong friend and forensic archaeology expert. Karras agrees, but warns Nick that this exposé may be not only dangerous but also life-threatening.
Dimitri, on the verge of losing his business, has arranged for the sale of his ship’s valuable berth to his despised, albeit wealthy, competitor. But at the last moment, help comes from an unexpected direction: a Scot who’s willing to hire Dimitri, and his boat, for an incredible money-making opportunity that will save his business and provide for his ailing father. The only problem? He’s being hired to smuggle.
Dimitri, Nick and Carey delve into the dangerous world of artifact and treasure thefts and conspiracies. What they discover along the way will impact their lives, their freedom, and, for two of them, their relationship with a God they had ignored for most of their lives. Both men are deeply drawn to Carey, her vibrant life, and her faith in God. Will the three survive the perils ahead? Will a great treasure of the Christian church be lost? And last but not least, will Carey choose Nick or Dimitri?

Social monitoringOverview of the Annual Performance Report Development: See Indicator 1
Percent of noncompliance corrected within one year of identification:
Percent = [(b) divided by (a)] times 100.
States are required to use the "Indicator C 9 Worksheet" to report data for this indicator (see Attachment A).
This Indicator documents the correction of noncompliance within one year for findings identified in FFY08/SFY09 (i.e., those sent to CFC offices on December 18, 2008, and then revised on March 5, 2009) and on site monitoring visits conducted in FFY08/SFY09. There were no complaints or hearing requests that resulted in a finding of noncompliance. Of the findings identified in FFY08/SFY09, 59.2% were corrected within one year. The target for this indicator is 100%. For finding identified in FFY07/SFY08, 98.2% were corrected within one year. The two remaining uncorrected findings (under 8C) identified in FFY07/SFY08 have been corrected.
The drop in this measure from 98.2% in FFY08/SFY09 to 59.2% can be attributed to the addition of "prong 2" to findings identified for Indicators 1, 7 and 8, ensuring that CFC offices have correctly implemented the specific regulatory requirement, as defined in OSEP Timely Correction Memo 09-02. When a finding has been identified, the CFC office develops a corrective action plan and implementation is documented. Child-specific data are accessed through the data systems (i.e., the Service Delay Reporting and Cornerstone systems) and file reviews to ensure that correction for that child has occurred. Prong 2 involves the documentation that a CFC office has implemented the regulatory requirement using monthly statistical reports that show three consecutive months during which the CFC office shows (100%) compliance.
In FFY09/SFY10, the greatest challenge for correction of noncompliance was for Indicator 1, service delays, in which 20 of the 21 identified findings remain uncorrected. Challenges for timely services are discussed under Indicator 1. Several factors related to compliance with this indicator, including provider payment delays, are not under the control of the CFC office or the Bureau. For other indicators (7 and 8C) the issue involves documenting three consecutive months with 100% compliance. Several CFC offices fall in and out of 100% compliance with one or two consecutive months of compliance, but not 3 consecutive months. Non-compliance usually involves a very small number of children, as demonstrated by CFC-specific date for these indicators. Lack of correction of two findings for 8A involved noncompliance with1file in each of two CFC offices with an uncorrected finding.
Improvement Activities Completed: Illinois has a process in place to document the identification and correction of noncompliance as soon as possible but in no case later than one year from identification, which builds on Illinois' extensive use of its data system. The process of notifying CFC offices of findings has been combined with the determination process, allowing CFC offices to fully address areas of concern into a comprehensive correction action plan. As part of efforts to address noncompliance, all new service coordinators complete on-line training modules. The Illinois Early Intervention Training Program continues to update and modify the modules as needed and upon the request and approval of the Department.
For Indicator 1, 7 and 8C, correction within 12 months of the notification of a finding is now identified when data demonstrate that a CFC office has 100 percent compliance during three consecutive months.
For Indicator 8A, correction will be documented when no files at the subsequent annual monitoring review indicate a finding, based upon identified transition elements in the monitoring review tool.
Actions Taken if Noncompliance Not Corrected: Corrective action plans to address noncompliance policies, procedures, and practices are required to be written and implemented for any finding of non-compliance. Compliance is considered in setting determination scorecards if an agency fails to submit a credible corrective action plan, fails to make adequate progress, or fails to implement major features of the plan. Determination scores are negatively impacted by poor performance in performance measures.
Verification of Correction of FFY 2008 findings (either timely or subsequent): See steps outlined below.
Describe the specific actions that the State took to verify the correction in FFY 2009 of findings of noncompliance identified in FFY 2008: When a finding has been identified, the CFC office develops a corrective action plan and implementation is documented. In addition, the following steps are taken.
There are several elements of the CFC monitoring file review tool that relate to documentation of the transition process. Transition elements from the CFC monitoring file review tool that reflect compliance with Indicator 8(a) include the following:
Correction of Remaining FFY 2007 Findings of Noncompliance (if applicable)
If the State reported less than 100% for this indicator in its FFY 2007 APR and did not report that the remaining FFY 2007 findings were subsequently corrected, provide the information below:
Correction of Any Remaining Findings of Noncompliance from FFY 2006 or Earlier - not applicable
Additional Information required by the OSEP APR Response Table for this Indicator (if applicable):).
Illinois Part C is implementing a coordinated system of finding notification and correction.
On a quarterly basis, data will be reviewed to ensure that implementation of corrective action plans have been documented, child specific correction has taken place, and CFC offices demonstrate three consecutive months with 100 percent compliance. When compliance with OSEP Timely Correction Memo 09-02 is
present, CFC offices will be notified that correction of a finding has taken place. The program will also communicate with the EI Monitoring Program to track and document correction of noncompliance for 8A that has been identified through file reviews as part of the on-site CFC office review process. The system will also track correction of noncompliance identified based upon dispute resolution, complaints and hearings.
This will be implemented in FFY10/SFY11 as part of the finding notification process and will continue as an ongoing strategy.
Resources include the Bureaus of Early Intervention and Performance Support Services and the EI Monitoring Program.
Resources include the Bureaus of Early Intervention and Performance Support Services.
Beginning in July 2011and on an ongoing basis, "mini APR tables" will be provided to CFC offices on a quarterly basis, so that they can monitor performance on Indicators 1, 7, and 8C.5 Tips to Select the Right Dress for a Date
Going on a date, you have all mixed feelings of being excited, nervous, happy and curious; an influx of emotions, all at the same time. On top of it all, comes the major concern, what to wear and how to dress up. When you go on a date it’s like creating an impression or image about you and your personality, the way you carry yourself and dress up does matter, and hence attention must be paid. Here are 5 tips to select the right dress for your date.
1. Choose a dress according to your comfort zone
Yes it’s true you have to dress your best to impress, but going out of your comfort zone and dressing, will end you up in a complete mess. It is a good thing to try out new things and take extra efforts, but not to an extent that you become super conscious while you are on a date. Choose a dress in which you are comfortable, and yet it enhances your beauty.
2. Too much revealing must be avoided
Agreed you have great assets and you are proud of it, but wearing clothes that are really revealing would give wrong signals. Dress up in a way which that shows your beautiful features and that highlights your best side but do not wear something that is very revealing.
3. Dress according to the place and occasion
It is very important to be dressed according to the kind of place you are going to. Being over or under dressed would make you and your partner feel awkward, it’s better to inquire about the venue in case you are unaware about what kind of place it is.MassDOT/MBTA Boardroom

The United States' UN Ambassador, Samantha Power, said Wednesday that Washington is “deeply concerned” by Israel's decision to turn 4,000 dunams of land in the Etzion Bloc region into state land.
The US “position on settlement activity is very well known,” she told reporters. .”
Asked by Al Jazeera if the US could support the Palestinian Authority's initiative to set a timetable for “an end to the occupation of the Palestinian territories,” Power said: .”
She was also asked what steps the US intends to take to push forward a ceasefire deal between Israel and Hamas, and whether the US wants a UN Security Council resolution on the matter. Power stated: .”

SMART MAN, AND THAT IS WHY HE KEPT HIS SEAT.November 03 2010 at 11:56 AM Report abuse Permalink rate up rate down Reply
After reading the political races around the nation, I can only make one point or maybe a few. Every person running for office and is behind, will say and do everything in their respective power to get the vote. I cannot understand a country that allows anyone to run for an office that spends millions of dollars on a $200,000 job. It just does not make any sense. First of all, every representative of states based on number of people is in the house. I am not sure what the number is... however, if these people go to Washington and vote according to their districts, instead of their parties, we would be so much further ahead. I am tired of people following the party instead of following the people. This would create bipartianism. As far as the Senate, we only get two per state (thank GOD). Nontheless, they also should vote regarding how the state feels about an issue. This would bring the government to the people instead of party lines. Remember this will bring government for the people, by the people. One last thing. Why doesn't America lower the corporate tax rate for all businesses doing business in America. In other words, if Ford would sell a car in America, the corporate rate would be 10%, however, if they sell that car in China, then they would pay 20%. We can always talk about businesses having their company in America and only sells in America. Which I think should be the lowest tax break of all. I do not like companies that sell in America, but move to Mexico for lower labor. These companies should be charged the highest rate of tax.October 28 2010 at 10:47 AM Report abuse Permalink +1 rate up rate down Reply

In normal time, you are correct about check and balance. But, in this cycle, we have no other choices but to vote out Dems.

Much has been said and written about conservative Republicans forcing the moderates out of their party. Here we have an example of the opposite...moderate and conservative Democrats have no place as their party lurches to the left. Manchin has been an exemplary governor...but in Washington voters fear that he'll be yet another Democrat forced to rubber stamp the administration's policies. Even with the commercial where Manchin loads his rifle and fires a round into the cap and trade bill, the public is suspicious (and not without reason). He'll take care of West Virginia...but will it be the same way that Ben Nelson of Nebraska (The Cornhusker Kickback)or Mary Landreau of Louisiana (The Lousiana Purchase) "took care" of their state in return for backing Obama's agenda? Kentucky has long been Republican in national issues while every bit as Democratic as West Virginia in state races. Perhaps there is something sensible here...at least until the Democratic party regains the centrist position.October 25 2010 at 1:12

We all know Halloween as trick-or-treating, costume contests, bobbing for apples, Halloween parties, and other fun activities.
Halloween activities and traditions around the world are a little different. For instance, in Scotland there is a tradition of telling one’s future spouse by carving an apple in one long strip, then tossing the peel over one’s shoulder. The peel is believed to then land in the shape of the first letter of the future spouse’s name. Unmarried women were told that if they sat in a darkened room and gazed into a mirror on Halloween night, the face of their future husband would appear. However, if they were destined to die before marriage a skull would appear.
Another Halloween game/superstition was playing fortune teller. To play this game, symbols (dollar sign- wealth, clothespin- poverty, rice- wedding, umbrella- journey, four leaf clover- good luck) were cut out of paper and placed on a platter. A person would enter a dark room and was ordered to place his or her hand on a piece of ice, then lay it on a platter. His or her “fortune” would stick to the hand.
So, whatever your tradition, game, or superstition- Happy Halloween from the Fairview!!Sex hook ups in West Chester

>>> it's tuesday, october 2nd , 2012 . i'm chloyce talbott. mitt romney landed in colorado last night and scored the endorsement of the big guy . the legendary quarterback and now executive vice president of football operations john elway . it was the only scheduled talk. it was a stealth bomber in the background there. romney tried to tamp down expectations in the back.
>> people want to know who is going to win? who is going to score the punches and who is going to make the biggest difference in the arguments they make? in my view, it's not so much winning or losing or even the people themselves. it's about something bigger than that. these debates are an opportunity for each of us to describe the pathway forward for america that we would choose.
>> playing off the enthusiastic crowd. romney had lines for the base. may even tested out a few zingers we might hear wednesday night.
>> this is a home to focus on the family which is committed to preserving the foundation of america . we have to get the pipe laine from canada if i have to build it myself.
>> it will kill america 's entrepreneurship.
>> that's the first time, by the way, romney talked about card check on the stump since the primaries. others call it the employee free choice act . it was a priority four years ago. it never passed because a few democrats helped kill it. it's faded from the debate since 2009 . that's why it was odd to hear it last night. the president took a break from a more low key debate schedule. he delivered pizzas to the local campaign office where he also called some volunteers and did a little joking about his own debate prep.
>> basically they are putting me indoors all the time. it's a drag. they are making me do my homework.
>> as romney and obama hunkered down, their surrogates are fan ing out across the country today. the first lady, ohio. that's where early voting begins today. biden is in north carolina . march koe rubio brackets the president's visit in vegas. paul ryan kicks off a bus tour of the buckeye state .
>> i was teaching the kids the song on the way over here.
>> we screw that up. of course, he's in iowa. not ohio. in an interview, romney was pressed for specifics on his tax plan. after ryan said on fox news on sunday the math would take too long to explain.
>> you could say everybody is going to get up to a $70,000 deduction and can use your charitable deduction or home mortgage deduction or others. and you can fill that bucket if you will, the $17,000 bucket that way and higher income people might have a lower number. or you could do it by the same method that boll simpson did it. but that's the sort of thing you do with congress.
>> so that's the most detail we have heard romney talk about this idea of different buckets and a cap on deductions. but still it's been at nearly every stop in the the last two weeks. romney has had to explain the 47% remark. don't be surprised if we hear a version of this answer when it comes up wednesday night.
>> if you could go back to that fundraiser, would you have said it differently?
>> it's not productive for someone to get into the detail of how a campaign is going to cop l together the people i need to win an election. i'm a president for 100% of the american people and that's the real% people care about. not 47 versus anyone else . i will be president for 100% of the feem.
>> of course, 47% is something we're hearing a lot in tv ads. the president's campaign continues to pound the issue on the air waves. heading into tomorrow night's debate, the president and romney each have two vulnerabilities. whatever candidate exploits his opponents will end the night with the upper hand. for the president, he hasn't fully described what his second term is going to look like. proposals in tv ads and on the stump like a million new manufacturing jobs, 100,000 new math and science teachers. feel mores a operational than an actual detailed plan. given the fact there's hunger for change, what change can the incumbent promise? the president has to come up with a good enough explanation of how reelecting him would break the partisan fever in washington. what does romney have to deal with? he hasn't differentiated from george bush 's. and his plans lack specifics. in a one-on-one debate, candidates have a lot of control over how aggressive they are. both romney and the president are inexperienced in a one-on-one debate format. few details on the format. the president and romney will be at podiums, standing, not sitting, and there will be no basic time limits on their answers. it's not 90 seconds, buzzer, things like that. it's up to the discretion of the moderator, jim leierer. that's going to be up to him. but there's supposed to be a lot of leeway here over how long the conversations go. the debate is on domestic policy. 90 minutes is supposed to be devoted to the economy specifically with governing and health care . but we'll see if the general nature of those areas allows libya to come up, which we know the romney folks want to do. debates are as much about style as substance and this is a reality show where obama and romney will meet in the first time in nearly five years before their biggest audience of the campaign. the first 2008 presidential debate between the president and john mccain got seven times the audience of the highest rated 2012 republican primary debate. think about that. seven times. past debates show romney and obama have to worry about cut away shots that are less than flattering. in the past both candidates have come across as irritable, patronizing or disengaged. this was chris christie 's advice to the candidates yesterday.
>> what you do is go out and be yourself. and people either like it or don't. if they don't, they are going to vote for somebody else. not a tragedy. no one dies.
>> finally speaking of debates, there was a barn burner last night in massachusetts where scott brown and democratic challenger elizabeth warren faced off in a debate. moderated by nbc's david gregory . it was tense from the outset.
>> if you're going to comment on my record, i would at least have you refer to it -- excuse me. i'm not a student in your classroom. please let me respond, okay?
>> that was an echo of a quip brown used in 2010 when he told martha kwaurkly i'm not in your courtroom, i'm not a defendant. i the two fought over whether elizabeth warren used her native american heritage to gain employment advantage.
>> i listed myself as native american . i was listed there. it's part of who i am.
>> do you consider yourself a minority?
>> i consider myself as having a native american background. that's what i said, that's what i am.
>> is she a liar? is that your judgment?
>> david, you'd have to ask her who she e actually is. at the pinnacle of her success at harvard, she changed back to being white.
>> all night, brown did his best to help voters forget he has a party. he kept calling himself an independent thinker saying mitch mcconnell has a lot of work to do to earn his vote to become potentially majority leader if republicans get enough seats. even saying he'd support john kerry for secretary of state. but he did trip up when he was asked to name his model supreme court justice .
>> let me see here. that's a great question. i think justice scalia is a very good judge. justice kennedy is obviously very good. and justice roberts , justice --
>> warren couldn't hold in her laughter, but she had her own oops moment.
>> can you name some republicans in the senate today that you are able to work with on big issues, substantiative issues the country faces?
>> probably richard lugar would come to mind.
>> he's not going to be there. who else can you name?
>> that is a problem.

The Woodland Kingfisher (Halcyon senegalensis) belongs to the tree kingfisher family.
Distribution.
Woodland Kingfishers mostly migrate at night.
This is a medium-sized kingfisher, 20 - 24 cm in length and weight between 54 - 81g.
The adult has a bright blue back, wing panel and tail. Its head, neck and underparts are white, and its shoulders are black.The large bill has a red upper mandible and black lower mandible. The legs are bright red. Some birds may have greyish heads, causing confusion with Mangrove Kingfisher.
However, the lores are dark, creating a dark stripe through the eye (the stripe does not extend through the eye in Mangrove Kingfisher), and the underwing, primaries and secondaries (shorter, upper "arm" feathers) are black with white underwing coverts (there is a black carpal patch on the white coverts in Manrgove Kingfisher). The inner webs of the base of the flight feathers are white, creating an indistinct white wingbar (white completely absent from wings in Mangrove Kingfisher). The breast is white (tends to be much greyer in Mangrove Kingfisher).
The sexes look alike. Juveniles are duller than adults; they are narrowly barred on the sides of the underparts; and they have a dusky-brown bill.
The flight of the Woodland Kingfisher is rapid and direct.
The Woodland Kingfishers are aggressively territorial, attacking intruders - including humans.
The call of this noisy kingfisher is a loud trill.
It hunts from an exposed perch, often on a dead branch of a tree, or perches quietly in semi-shade while seeking food.
The prey is mainly a wide variety of large insects, but also other arthropods, snakes, fish and frogs.
Fish, crabs and birds are rarely taken.
Unlike most kingfishers, Woodland Kingfishers rarely dive for fish.
Woodland Kingfishers migrate to Southern Africa from October to April to breed.
They breed from November to March in the Transvaal and November to January in Mozambique and Zimbabwe.
During the breeding season, they are are highly vocal and very striking display while calling with outspread wings to show the white linings.
The nest is a tree hole excavated by a woodpecker or barbet. They may also nest under the eaves of a house or in the old nest of Little Swifts. The average clutch consists of 2-4 glossy white eggs. These eggs are incubated for 13 - 14 days. Both parents raise the chicks jointly. The young fledge when they are 15 - 22 days old.

North Carolina Federation of Republican Women Rescinds Invitation to Local Author to Speak on Non-Political Issue for Being an Unaffiliated Voter
This content is provided by press release through Box Canyon Press, an independent third-party content provider.
Source: Alan Rosenthal, Author – Safer Online Dating©
Asheville, NC, Feb. 04, 2013 /Box Canyon Press/ — A February talk on Safer Online Dating©, taken from the book of the same name, has been canceled due to the author’s voting status of unaffiliated. Local author Alan Rosenthal was originally invited to speak by the local Blue Ridge Republican Women’s Club. At the direction of the North Carolina Federation of Republican Women, the chartering organization of the local group, the invitation to speak was rescinded because the state group’s rules only allow for registered Republicans to address the group.
“This is very unfortunate. I’ve worked professionally for many Republicans and have helped some get elected but my talk is not about politics. This is about keeping all people safe. I think it is shameful but I really feel bad for the woman who extended the invitation. She was caught in the middle and had to give me the news,” Rosenthal said.
Here is the note that was sent to the author:
“Please accept my sincere apologies for the information I’m about to deliver. It seems that because the Blue Ridge Republican Women’s Club is chartered through the North Carolina Federation of Republican Women, we must abide by their rules for speakers, which states that speakers must be registered Republicans. When sharing next month’s program notes with the board, I noted that you were unaffiliated…and then learned about rules governing speakers. I’m so sorry to have to rescind the invitation — it feels extraordinarily awkward and unprofessional to do so, and I hope that you have the grace to find it amusing rather than simply irritating.”
Rosenthal made it clear about the sender of the note, “The local area representative has been wonderful. I would suggest that she was mortified at this decision. This is simply an inane and thoughtless policy, especially when both parties are losing voters to unaffiliated in droves. This is not exactly a welcome mat for Republican causes or an invite to join the party. When I’m asked to help people in trouble, I don’t ask for their voter status.” Taking it in stride, Rosenthal quipped, “Well, I guess it’s one way to affirm I’m a writer. I feel like Salman Rushdie but without the death threats.”

- Share a TipI have this borderline difficult HW assignment that introduced ArrayLists about a lesson back from the one I am on now. Currently I am having difficulty doing something (and wording) to make the script work right. Lets say I have the following (example script):
ArrayList<ShapesV4> shapes = new ArrayList<ShapesV4>(); shapes.add(new ShapesV4(10, 5)); shapes.add(new ShapesV4(7, 1)); shapes.add(new ShapesV4(5, 2));
Except mine has one int and several Boolean statements as the parameters of the "new shapes object". I am currently trying to figure out how to get the element of the parameters of one of the shapes objects. From what I have figured out, sometihng like shapes.get(x) will only get the object and not the element of a parameter of one of those objects. I need to be able to iterate through the parameters of all those objects but I don't know how to set that up. I figured it would look something like shapes.get(0[1]) to get the number 5 of the first object. But obviously that isn't correct... What is the correct setup if someone is kind enough to answer?Pediatric physical therapy, physical therapy for kids, children's physical therapy - Located in Anchorage, Alaska

Physical Therapy for Kids in Anchorage, Alaska provides specialized pediatric physical therapy to children with movement concerns from very mild delays to severe motor impairment. Many parents have concerns because their child falls frequently, has unusual movement or postures, or just doesn't seem to keep up with other kids/infants the same age. Other children have diagnoses with associated movement problems such Torticollis, Plagiocephaly, Cerebral Palsy, Down Syndrome, Spina Bifida, and other genetic disorders. And some have unknown reasons for evident developmental delays. PT for Kids can help with all of these through evaluation, treatment, and referrals for medical equipment and other services if necessary. Children can be treated at any age, from birth through 18 years of age.
Family support and participation is ideal for maximal progress. What the child and parents would like to achieve both with physical therapy and in other areas is considered first. Parent or guardian observation and involvement with therapy sessions is ideal and instruction for continued practice at home is a regular part of therapy. Implementation of techniques and activities on a daily basis is where most change occurs. A primary goal of PT for Kids is to teach the child and/or caregiver how to make changes in movement. Through repetition of new movement patterns the child learns and improves their skill.
Pediatric physical therapy can improve your child's ability to sit, crawl, walk, run, and play whether they need a little boost or lots of help, Physical Therapy for Kids can help your child move their best!SAGINAW, MI – Friends and fellow musicians will rally around Seth Payton, performing Friday, May 31, at White’s Bar, 2609 State, to raise funds toward his medical expenses.

Author's Introduction
Large numbers have interested me almost all my life.
This page covers all the huge numbers I have seen discussed in books and web pages, and it actually does so in numerical order, as near as I can tell (see the uncomparable and superclass 5 discussions).
One important thing to notice is that all discussions like this ultimately lead to difficult and unsolved problems in the theory of algorithms and computation. This page ends with Turing machines just before crossing over to the transfinite numbers. If you want to learn something about the theory of algorithms and computation, get two or more fairly knowledgeable people to compete at describing the highest number they can, and then stand back!. One such competition (detailed in a footnote) took only a few days to move beyond the range of everything discussed in the first two-thirds of this webpage, and then spent another few years discussing formal proofs.
This page is meant to counteract the forces of Munafo's Law of Mathematical Discourse. If you see room for improvement, let me know!
Classes
First of all, I'm going to define what I call "classes" of numbers. This is a somewhat refined and more precise version of the "levels of perceptual realities" presented by Douglas Hofstadter in a 1982 Scientific American column [38] (and reprinted in his 1985 book [40]).
(the concept of subitizing)
Class-0 numbers are those that are small enough to have an immediate intuitive or perceptual impact. Perceiving such a number is called subitizing, and for most purposes the limit has been shown to be somewhere from 5 to 9 (see Kaufman [29] and Miller [30]).. (Methods involving objects or symbols that each count for 5, 10 or larger values, came later, see below.). A person in a stadium with 10,000 people will have a fuzzier magnitude perception (they might guess anywhere from 3,000 to 30,000). By the time we get to numbers like 108 (the number of blades of grass in an acre) a person is probably about as likely to believe "10 million" (107) as "a trillion" (1012) unless!) I tried this myself at age 9 and reached 35000 before memory became too difficult.. Many examples are described in [44]., like base 2, 16 or 60). Typically this depends on how the digits are recorded and what you need to do with them. Since I used 6 as the upper limit of class 0, and 106 = 1000000 for the upper limit of class 1, I'll just continue the pattern and say that the class-2 numbers go from 106 to about 101000000.
Place-value notation was popularized in the Arabic culture (but came from India, and perhaps from China before that, again see [44]).. To make an exact calculation about thousands of objects, only a handful of objects (the digits) need to be manipulated.
Googol is a class-2 number, as are the various large prime numbers used in cryptography, all of the known Perfect numbers (until 1997!),, by my admittedly arbitrary decision, is a bit beyond the class-2 range).
The Big Number Names of Nicolas Chuquet
(number names based on Latin)
The word million comes from around 12702, and entered the English language around 13706. The names billion, trillion, and so on up to nonillion, plus the general idea of continuing with Latin-derived prefixes all first appear in the late 15th century, in writing by Nicolas Chuquet, a French mathematician living in Lyon from 1480 until his death in 1488. (There were also the longer forms bymillion and trimillion used as early as 1475 by Jehan Adam, but these never caught on). Follow this link for more details: Origins of the Chuquet number names.
Peletier's Proposal and the Short Scale.
The long scale is Chuquet's original system, and has digits grouped 6 at a time, thus trillion is a million times larger than billion. This is the "billion=1012 system". Peletier's names for 10(6N+3) (in the English spelling, milliard=109, billiard=1015, etc.) are compatible with this system.
The use of number-names during the following few centuries eventually led to widespread usage of billion to mean 109, trillion for 1012, and similar redefinitions of the higher names. These definitions are the short scale or "billion=109 system". Follow this link for more on the history of short vs. long scale. Here is a related video by Numberphile: How big is a billion?.
Zillions: Big-Number Words as a Hyperbolic Adjective
While the confusion between short and long scale was becoming well-established, the big-number words ending in -illion were also becoming popular for the purpose of espressing an excessively or unimaginably large, or even infinite, quantity. This is a type of usage that was already common for hundreds, thousands, myriads and millions. For example, OED's [41] HUNDRED heading 2 a. begins: "Often used indefinitely or hyperbolically for a large number: cf. thousand. (With various constructions, as in [heading] I.)", and then gives nine quotations dating from 1300 AD to 1885. In the following table I show the first documented use of each number-name in both the literal sense and in this "superlative" sense.
(It should be noted that zillion more generally can refer to far larger things. For example, Howard DeLong[33] used the term "zillion" to refer to an iterated Ackermann function of some other really large number c1.[48]
Standard Accepted Names and SI Prefixes
This table shows all positive powers of ten that have authoritatively accepted names in English (by [41]) up to Chuquet's highest name nonillion. The numeric values here follow the billion=109 system ("short scale"). I am also including a few other non-powers of 10 that have names in English, but leaving out many base-20 constructions and other names less than 100, about which you can read plenty in [44]. I include all former and current official SI prefixes because they are quasi-"words" that have a purely numerical meaning. The dates of first literal and superlative usage are largely from OED [41] but are augmented as indicated in the footnotes.
The Standard Names and SI Prefixes
Chuquet left it to others to work out the details of extending the names beyond nonillion. Although there is much discrepancy between the actual number-names in Latin and the -illion names Chuquet listed, it was nevertheless understood that Latin number-names were to be used to extend the names as needed. Using Latin for prefixes goes smoothly as far as vigintillion. The following names are found in many dictionaries19; vigintillion and centillion are a little more common than the others. Some popular non-dictionary sources have made reference to millillion and milli-millillion (mostly due to Henkle/Brooks, and Borgmann [32]).
Larger Standard Names Beyond Chuquet's Nonillion
The Conway-Wechsler System
Chuquet's names are notable for being well-researched, faithful to Latin within limits of utility, for retaining the meaning of existing widely-used names, and for being proposed by a respected well-known mathematician. The Henkle/Brooks names fall short of that mark on one or two counts.
The only modern-day system with equivalent qualifications is that described by Conway in [42]. It extends the Chuquet names arbitrarily far, and surpasses the other ad-hoc systems by having better spelling, greater consistency, and avoiding hyphens. It was developed by John Horton Conway and Allan Wechsler after significant research into Latin5. Olivier Miakinen4,9 refined it to fix a few minor problems, as described below.
The system is based on the short scale (billion=109) but the names could easily be used in a long scale system. A number name is built out of pieces representing powers of 103, 1030 and 10300 as shown by this table:
The rules are:
- Take the power of 10 you're naming and subtract 3.
- Divide by 3. If the remainder is 0, 1 or 2, put one, ten or one hundred at the beginning of your name (respectively).
- For a quotient less than 10, use the standard names thousand, million, billion and so on through nonillion. Otherwise:
- Break the quotient up into 1's, 10's and 100's. Find the appropriate name segments for each piece in the table. (NOTE: The original Conway-Wechsler system specifies quinqua for 5, not quin.)
- String the segments together, inserting an extra letter if the letter shown in parentheses at the end of one segment match a letter in parentheses at the beginning of the next. For example: septe(mn) + (ms)viginti = septemviginti because the (m)'s match; Another example: se(sx) + (mx)octoginta = sexoctoginta.
- For the special case of tre, the letter s should be inserted if the following part is marked with either an s or an x.
- Remove a final vowel, if any.
- Add illion at the end. You're done.
Many of the resulting names are only slightly different from one another. For example 10261 is sexoctogintillion and 102421 is sexoctingentillion. Then there's 10309 = duocentillion while 10603 = ducentillion; and similarly 10312 = trescentillion while 10903 = trecentillion.
However, if such subtleties of spelling (and probably pronunciation) don't bother you, the Conway-Wechsler system extends to arbitrarily high values. After setting out the rules above, the authors continue7:
With Allan Wechsler we propose to extend this system indefinitely by combining these according to the convention that "XilliYilliZillion" (say) denotes the (1000000X + 1000Y + Z)th zillion, using "nillion" for the zeroth "zillion" when this is needed as a placeholder. So for example the million-and-third zillion is a "millinillitrillion."
As their example shows, the beginning parts of the standard names such as million and trillion are used for the "1" and "003" parts (respectively) of the number 1,000,003, with the placeholder "nilli" for the central "000" portion. This is the "1,000,003rd zillion", which is 103×1000003+3=103000012. In general, when naming 103N+3, the rules above are to be used for each group of 3 digits in the number N.
For another example, consider 1019683: this is 103×6560+3, so N=6560. That breaks up into a "6" part (the standard sextillion) and a "560" part (sexagintaquingentillion by the above table and rules); these are combined to form sextillisexagintaquingentillion which is the full Conway-Wechsler name for 1019683.
The name for googolplex is ten trillitrestrigintatrecentilli....trestrigintatrecentilliduotrigintatrecentillion; with the "...." replaced by 30 additional repetitions of "trestrigintatrecentilli". This name is two words and 3+766 letters long.

Las Vegas (Nov 12, 2012) – The Cosmopolitan of Las Vegas welcomes Flogging Molly with special guest Mariachi El Bronx to the Boulevard Pool for St. Patrick’s Day weekend on Saturday, March 16 at 9 p.m.
Tickets to Flogging Molly will go on sale Friday, Nov. 16 at 10 a.m. PST and are available online at or through Ticketmaster at 800.745.3000. General admission tickets are $35 (plus applicable taxes and service charges). A limited number of premium cabanas are also available by emailing Nightlife Marketing.
Founded in Los Angeles in 1997, Flogging Molly has always defied categorization. The infectious originality of their songs is a badge of honor and key to the band's creativity. Flogging Molly infuses punk rock with Celtic instruments—violin, mandolin and the accordion—and merges blues progressions with grinding guitars and traditional Irish music. Theirs is music of exile and rebellion, of struggle, history and protest..

Perfect ocean-front resort condo-highly recommendPosted Dec 28, 2014 on Hotels.com
Marvelous stay in a perfect ocean-front resort location. The condo was impeccably decorated by it's owners - clean, charming, and very attractive. The resort setting afforded us ready access to a host of amenities - golf course, three beautiful on-site beaches, clubhouse, shopping area, and gourmet restaurants in two of the resorts' four-star hotels. Pathways allowed easy walking access to everything, including an interesting historic lava-flow site and some lovely tropic fish ponds. But if we preferred not to walk or take our rental vehicle, the resort also offered complimentary shuttle service between destinations. Located conveniently north of the Kona Airport, we had ready driving access to several of the islands' most famed beaches - Hapuna State Park and Mauna Kea were a handy ten-minute drive to the north. Loved our stay and would undoubtedly stay here again on future trips.

Lovely location and viewPosted Oct 26, 2014 on Hotels.com
We were very happy with our that at Mauna Lani Point, we stayed in unit F204. The layout and appliances available at the unit were great. We had a great view out of the back of the unit. It's a short walk to the pool/grill area where you can lounge by the pool, check out the sauna, or grill up some dinner. Not far from the building is a nice little beach with some good snorkeling, in the other direction is a shopping plaza with food, groceries, coffee, snorkel rentals, etc. The decor of the room seemed a little dated (musty white shag carpeting). The bottom seal of the shower had slipped a little causing water to leak on the floor, when I slid the seal back to where it was supposed to be black gunk came off on my hand,people in general wouldn't touch that through normal use but it should still be deep cleaned every now and then.

Pros: location to golf course
Cons: Beds, couches, unit needs updating. A BBQ grill on the patio as was indicated in your guide.
Location: Golf.
We did not get a condo with a BBQ grill on the patio, as was stated. The beds were VERY uncomfortable. There were no robes to use. The couches were very uncomfortable. The kitchen was very limited on amenities. The unit was very dated. I would rate this unit a 3 star NOT a 4 star as was noted in your guide. The view was very limited on the Fairway due to overgrown bushes.

The two of us had a great time here during our October stay. The room was large with very nice finishes and it had a good view of the ocean across the fairway. It was very quiet. The private beach was small but nice and not crowded. Swimming and snorkeling are good at this beach. The grocery store in the resort had everything needed for making meals in the condo. The resort grounds were well maintained and car and people traffic were light. This is a great place for couples looking for a relaxing atmosphere.

ビーチとゴルフ場と山が見えていい部屋でしたPosted Sep 30, 2014
ハワイ島には１０年振りぐらいで、以前泊まったことのあるマウナラ二リゾートに決めました。そして今回はマウナラ二ポイントを選びました。海辺にあって静かなコンドミニアムは少なくてここは貴重な所だと思います。 部屋は思っていた通り、奇麗で豪華で問題なかったですが、多少古くなっているかなという感じはします。眺めなどは、１ベッドルームということで選択できる部屋は少なかったようです。気になったのは時々蟻とか小さな虫が入ってきたことぐらいです。できるなら虫退治を利用する前にしておいて欲しい。ヤモリもラナイ近辺にはいますが私は気にならなかったです。総じて快適に過ごせる場所だと思います。

This is so cool! Digital flash photography has just taken a light speed jump forward making macro flash and flash photography in general much easier, more rewarding with amazing results. This is an amazingly well thought out system!
The R1C1 (what a name) is comprised of the R1 close-up remote kit (pictured here), SU-800 Speedlight Commander (unit in the hot shoe) and SB-R200 Wireless Remote Speedlights (flashes on the ring). As soon as you see the box that holds all of this, you instantly know there’s more to this unit than just a couple of flashes. In fact when you purchase the entire kit, there is so much stuff that comes with it, the instruction book has packing information! That’s right, the case that holds all of this gear needs packing instructions. But don’t freak, if you don’t want to carry the huge case around, the kit comes with soft pouches to break everything out for easy travel. As I said, this is one well thought out system!
The main components of the R1C1 are the SU-800 and SB-R200s. These three units provide you wireless macro flash capability. What’s cool, you can simply slap this thing on your camera, place the flashes wherever you want them (they have modeling lights to help you with lighting patterns), dial in lighting ratios with the push of one button, fire and the iTTL system gives you the right exposure. That’s the very basics, it can do one heck of a lot more.
The R1C1 system works with Nikon’s iTTL so you can have as many as EIGHT SB-R200 on the ring working for you, either as one light bank or three banks on five channels. You can add to this mix SB-800s wherever the subject demands and control them all from the SU-800! You can even take the SU-800 and use it with just SB-800s as the Master Unit so you don’t have to sacrifice a SB-800 to the task.
What about the quality of the light? They are flash units which by their very nature are a harsh light. Light modifiers and gels come with the R1C1 which can help. I think once you buy the R1C1 you will more than likely by a third or fourth SB-R200 to lighten up shadows and mellow out the two light sources. The SB-R200s aren’t real powerful, but they can put out 15 feet of light at f/4 at ISO 100. If time permits, I will add images the R1C1 link in Moose’s Camera Bag in the future to give you some better ideas of what it can do.
In the meantime, I would strongly suggest that if you do any type of macro photography, you at the very least check out the R1C1. We have one at all DLWS events for folks, it’s just that amazing and powerful a tool for the wildlife/nature photographer.The film should just hang out on the sides of the neg carrier.

well here is a pic
i think i may have to look for a better enlarger this one seems more like a toy kinda one its very plasticy
hmm its the same model so i have a kids toy great so i see i need to keep looking
hey would you be willing to scan that Manuel for me i dont have one thank you
You can probably sand off most of the rust on thr easel, but the, you'll have to repaint it in that same yellowish color. There are also some good deals on "the bay" for them. The Durst is a prety darn good unit, specialy for free. What lens (if any) came with it? Free is always good!
isco-gottingen 1:5.6/50
is what it says its plastic and fixed i cant take it out
on the top there is 3 flat lenses that sit under the bulb
So what if its an entry level enlarger, for what you paid for it, its a good starting point. A little clean-up and start printing. We all started somewhere, my first enlarger was a 1940's era diffusion machine that I had to make a negative carrier for. Use it, and keep an eye out for a more versatile machine.It's Good To Be King By Ezra Edmond A short musical about how good it is to be the king.

After 2 failed attempts to try Hard Rock Cafe (over the past 2 years!), we finally did last week. I was feeling very “man zhang” so rif treated me to dinner. 😛
The place was awfully packed, and we had to wait for 30 minutes at the bar. Luckily, they gave us our table within 10 minutes. Since it was still happy hour (buy 1 free 1), rif ordered a Carlsberg Pilsner. I had plain water, since Jeen and rif banned my alcohol intake for a freaking month!
We shared a plate of Hard Rock Nachos and a Hickory Smoked BBQ Trio Combo. The waiter asked us to take the “kiddy” nachos portion o_0, as he thought we wouldn’t be able to finish the food. Hmmmm…
I insisted on my huge ass plate of nachos anyway, and a huge ass plate it was! Fresh tortilla chips generously topped with stringy cheese, pinto beans, sour cream, onions, pico de gallo, jalapenos and served with a side of fresh salsa.
Pico de gallo is a fresh condiment made from chopped tomato, onion, and jalapeños chile. A simple starter with basic but fresh ingredients, I enjoyed it. It’s does not contain meat, unlike Chili’s version.
While we were finishing the last pieces of our nachos, the trio platter arrived. As rif was cutting the beef ribs, I tucked into the baked beans and coleslaw. The beans had a smokey flavour which I liked. The ribs were as gorgeous as it looked. Tender, smokey and oozing with flavour, I regret being so biased towards beef ribs.
The beef steak was just as good and delightfully tender! Topped with fried onions and smokey BBQ sauce, I enjoyed every bite. Since they did so well with the ribs and steak, I was slightly disappointed the chicken was dry. I took the thigh, while rif took the drumstick. The thigh was still acceptable, being dry only at the sides. The drumstick tasted like jerky.
We were already very full, but decided to try the Hot Fudge Brownie Sundae. Again, the portion was huge. The brownie was as big my palm! And topped with vanilla ice cream, a generous squeeze of whipped cream, chocolate sauce, sprinkles and cherry. It was moist, rich and very good.
There was a lion dance that night, since it was still Chinese New Year. I think only the foreigners were excited! 😛 Dinner cost RM 157.55 inclusive of tax and service charge. Not cheap, but worth every cent. Thanks for dinner rif!

"How People Make Things," which opens Saturday in Whitaker's Harsco Science Center, is a salute to manufacturing inspired by the late Fred Rogers, the longtime host of "Mr. Rogers' Neighborhood" on PBS.
A quote from Rodgers greets visitors on a plaque at the exhibit entrance: "My father and my two grandmothers worked in factories, and I was always interested in their work. When we show factories, they certainly have fascinating machines, but I always emphasize that it takes people to make machines and to make them work. I like children to know that people can take pride in their work and that everyone's job is important."
Rogers, a Latrobe native who died in 2003, often included factory tours on his children's show. That was the inspiration for this exhibit, created by the Children's Museum of Pittsburgh.
Pennsylvania-made products feature prominently in the exhibit, including crayons, Cannondale bicycles and the Slinky. Mr. Rogers is there, too, in the form of videos of the factory tours from his show.
Tickets: (Harsco Science Center admission includes exhibit) $13.75 adult; $11.75 for children (ages 3 to 12) students (with ID) and seniors (55 and over). Hours: 9:30 a.m.-5 p.m. Monday through Saturday, and 11:30 a.m.-5 p.m. Sunday. Info: 214-2787 or.NHL Games
NHL Playoffs: Vancouver Canucks at San Jose Sharks

Minnesota Wild's Dany Heatley, center, celebrates his goal with teammates during the second period of an NHL hockey game against the San Jose Sharks in San Jose, Calif., Wednesday, April 3, 2013. (AP Photo/Marcio Jose Sanchez)THE ‘that was made’ seems, from its uselessness, weak even to foolishness after what precedes: ‘.
‘ that statement of the evangelist with which I have now to do, ‘All things were made’ not by, but ‘through him.’: ‘All things were made through him, and without him was made not one thing. That which was made in him was life.’ You begin to see it? The power by which he created the worlds was given him by his father; he had in himself a greater power than that by which he made the worlds. There was something made, not through but in him; something brought into being by himself. Here he creates in his grand way, in himself, as did the Father. ‘That which was made in him was life.’
What does this mean? What is the life the apostle intends? Many forms of life have come to being through the Son, but those were results, not forms of the life that was brought to existence in him. He could not have been employed by the Father in creating, save in virtue of the life that was in. As to what the life of God is in relation to us, we know that it is the causing life of everything that we call life—of everything that is; and in knowing this, we know something of that life, by the very forms of its force. But the one interminable mystery, of that relation. Meeting this relation, loving his father with his whole being, he is not merely alive as born of God; but, giving himself with perfect will to God, choosing to die to himself and live to God, he therein creates in himself a new and higher life; and, standing upon himself, has gained the power to awake life, the divine shadow of his own, in the hearts of us his brothers and sisters, who have come from the same birth-home as himself, namely, the heart of his God and our God, his father and our father, but who, without our elder brother to do it first, would never have chosen that self-abjuration which is life, never, ‘Thy will, not mine, be done!’ He made himself what he is by deathing himself into the will of the eternal Father, through which will he was the eternal Son—thus plunging into the fountain of his own life, the everlasting Fatherhood, and taking the Godhead of the Son. This is the life that was made in Jesus: ‘That which was made in him was life.’ This life, self-willed in Jesus, is the one thing that makes such life—the eternal life, the true life, be partakers of the divine nature, or we perish. Man cannot originate this life; it must be shown him, and he must choose it. God is the father of Jesus and of us—of every possibility of our being; but while God is the father of his children, Jesus is the father of their.
‘ ‘: ‘I ‘love is the only good in the world,’ and selfishness the one thing hateful, in the city of the living God unutterable,, ‘My father, do with me as thou wilt, only help me against myself and for thee;’ if I cannot say, ‘I, ‘Thy will be done,’ he closes the everlasting life-circle; the life of the Father and the Son flows through him; he is a part of the divine organism. Then is the prayer of the Lord in him fulfilled: ‘I.” ‘ ‘loved.

SPARKS -- A Richmond man has been arrested for allegedly kidnapping two Modesto teenagers and taking them across the state line to a casino hotel in Nevada, where he is accused of sexually assaulting one of the girls, police said.
Nicholas Wessel, 37, was arrested at the Nugget Casino Resort in Sparks on Tuesday on suspicion of two counts of kidnapping, sexual assault, and production and possession of child pornography, according to authorities.
The two girls -- ages 14 and 15 -- were reported as runaways to Modesto police on Sunday. By Tuesday, police discovered one of them had interacted with Wessel on Facebook and was still logging in to her account. Investigators then contacted the social media giant to obtain an IP address, which led them to Nugget, said Sgt. Ivan Valencia of Modesto police. Within hours, Sparks police had Wessel and the teenagers in custody.
The girls later told investigators Wessel convinced them to accompany him to Nevada, where he got a hotel room. Inside the room, Wessel allegedly sexually assaulted the 14-year-old and took pictures of her, the girls told police. Investigators found images of the girl and other children on Wessel's camera, according to police.
The girls were taken to a Nevada juvenile hall, and Wessel was booked at Washoe County Jail.
"It's good to remind parents of the dangers of the Internet and be mindful of what their children are doing," Valencia said. "Predators are out there."

We know that Keith and Charla were doing some pretty heavy flirting that day on the beach, and Dave was very upset by this. If I remember correctly, it was Scott who talked to Keith about the possible un-coolness of this...and Keith did not feel he was being inappropriate (i agree, actually). Well he did seem to back off (Charla), but i'm sure that day was always in the back of Dave's mind. Then, at Pandora's Box, someone (who? who?) asked Charla if she ever tried to seduce anyone and she said, "Yes, Scott. But he turned me down." Now, i have no clue as to why Scott turned Charla down (memories of Melanie's mammories...sorry, couldn't help it...or he just didn't like Charla...loyalty to Dave...who knows?), but Dave, hearing that answer, might have felt that Scott did it because he knew how Dave felt about Charla and was being loyal to him. It's just a theory, but perhaps he felt torn because Scott appeared to be more of a "friend", at least when it came to Charla. He did tell Keith that Scott "had his back" for some time, and Scott not having sex with Charla is the only evidence of "having his back" that i remember for quite some time. Sorry. This was a really long thought.From a Picture of Pride to a Symbol of Abuse in Iraq

FORT.
If that is the case, the family and friends then have to reconcile how the tough, bold and independent young woman they know followed an order that seemed so obviously wrong.
"She's kind of stubborn," her mother, Terrie England, said. "But that doesn't mean she can't follow orders."
Her family brims with accounts about how strong willed Private England could be. In one, a thunderstorm and tornado blew into town just as her older sister was preparing to graduate from high school, forcing students and their parents to flee the ceremony. While her family huddled in the lowest spot that they could find in their trailer home, Private England wandered into the yard. Ignoring her family's pleas and with the wind howling as loud as a freight train, she tried to photograph the passing funnel.
"You talk about the unusual," Mrs. England said. "That child liked it."
It was a mother's way of saying her daughter could be impetuous, sometimes to the point of imprudence. It was, perhaps, the same streak that caused Private England to marry a longtime friend when she was 19, only to divorce him within two years. Or to sign up for the Army Reserve while in high school, over her parents' objections.
A friend, Kerry Shoemaker-Davis, said: "She is straight in your face, tells you how it is. That's why it shocked me. It's so not her. It's not in her nature to do something like that. There's not a malicious bone in her body."
Like another West Virginia woman whose life was turned upside-down by her experiences in Iraq, Jessica D. Lynch, who enlisted, Private England joined the Army Reserve because she wanted money for college and the chance to see the world outside her small town.
And just as Jessica Lynch's rescue from Iraqi troops became one of the biggest stories of the war, the story of the Abu Ghraib photographs has attracted hordes of news reporters to tiny Fort Ashby, a one-stoplight town in the West Virginia Panhandle that is perhaps best known for its history as an outpost in the French and Indian War.
Exhausted by the stream of reporters knocking on their door, the Englands fled today.
"They needed a vacation," Private England's best friend, Destiny Goin, said."We're not going talk about this today."
Lynndie Rana England was born in 1982 in Kentucky, where her father worked for a railroad company. The company transferred him to its station in Cumberland, Md., when she was 2. So the family moved to Fort Ashby, 13 miles south.
By all accounts, the family was extremely close. Lynndie and her siblings, an older sister and younger brother, spent much time together hunting, camping, fishing and swimming.
Her parents called her a tomboy, eager to prove that she was as tough and athletic as the guys. She played a mean center field in softball, her father, Kenneth, said on Wednesday in an interview. But she sometimes found it difficult to kill animals when they went hunting.
"I don't think she ever got a deer," Mrs. England, 44, said. "I think she went just because she wanted to be outside, and wanted to be with me."
In high school, her parents said, she was a good student, though she was not in the honor society, as her friend Destiny was. But she yearned to go to college, wanting to become a "stormchaser," the kind of meteorologist who does not simply study bad weather, but immerses herself in the middle of it.
Her parents say they had enough money to help her pay for college. But Private England, 21, insisted on doing it by herself. So she joined a local unit of the Army Reserve, the 372nd, in Cresaptown, Md., to obtain college benefits from the military.
"I told her I didn't want her to do it," Mrs. England said. "But she said, `Mom, I'm going to turn 18 in a month, and I'll just sign up anyway.' She could be like that."
After high school, she worked at a chicken-processing plant and at the nearby IGA supermarket. Then, in March 2002, on what seemed almost like a whim to some of her friends, she married an old friend who worked with her at the supermarket, James L. Fike. The couple were divorced, though they remain on friendly terms, Mrs. England said in interviews this week.
"It was like, one day, she was just married," Mrs. Shoemaker-Davis said. "She walked up to me at the 7-Eleven and said, `See what I did.' They had just gone to the courthouse and did it."
While in Iraq, members of the 372nd say, Private England became romantically involved with another man implicated in the abuse scandal, Specialist Charles A. Graner. Military officials say she is pregnant and has been sent to Fort Bragg, N.C.
She has not been charged, as Specialist Graner and five other members of the 372nd have. But military investigators have called her a suspect in the abuse inquiry and continue to question her.
In Fort Ashby, the Englands have kept their yellow ribbons that signify a soldier overseas pinned to their front stoop, though Private England is now in the United States. Inside, a Christmas tree decorated with red, white and blue lights and glass bulbs will remain up until she returns home.
"She called me in January and said, `Mom, something bad has happened, but don't worry about it,' " Mrs. England recounted. "Of course, that only made me worry more. But nothing could have prepared me for this."
The Englands learned of the photographs in a particularly jarring way. The couple had just returned from a turkey-hunting trip last week when they received a message from a co-worker of Kenneth, that Lynndie's picture had been on "60 Minutes II" on CBS-TV.
The next morning, Mrs. England brewed herself a pot of coffee, snapped on CNN and there, playing over and over and over again, were Private England and the Iraqi prisoners. Mrs. England put a hand to her mouth, steadied herself and said aloud, "Oh my god."
Mrs. England says she has spoken to her daughter since then, but has learned few details. Private England has not told her that she is pregnant, and she has said the Army has refused to give her a lawyer.
Mrs. England worries that war, Iraq and Abu Ghraib have changed her daughter forever. The girl who ran into thunderstorms ducked for cover when lightning crashed outside her window recently and thought she was hearing mortar fire, her mother said.
"Some times you think you can deal with anything," Mrs. England said. "And then you find you can't deal with what you thought you could. I don't know if everything she once wanted has changed."Contributeto QRZ

The 35-year-old, who recently gave birth to her first child, said she thought it was "fine" for expectant mothers to have a glass of wine after the first three months.
Her comments, were immediately criticised by medical experts who described them as “ill-informed” and “dangerous”.
The Government is currently reviewing guidelines on drinking alcohol when pregnant after experts warned that even very small amounts could result in Fetal Alcohol Syndrome which can lead to learning difficulties, poor co-ordination and attention deficit disorder.
Current UK guidelines say pregnant women can drink one or two units, the equivalent to one or two small glasses of wine or single measures of spirit, once or twice a week.
In the US and Canada complete abstinence from drinking is advised for expectant mothers.
Last night foetal alcohol syndrome specialist Dr Raja Mukherjee, of St George’s Hospital Medical School in London, said: “If Rachel Weisz has drunk during her pregnancy and the baby is fine then that’s just pure luck. The problem is that you don’t know who is at risk and who is not…
Miss Weisz, who won an Oscar last year for her role in The Constant Gardener made her comments in an interview in New York to publicise the film, in which she appears with actor Hugh Jackman.
Asked whether she thought a glass of wine was fine she replied: “Personally I do. They say not in the first three months though, but I think that after that it’s fine. I mean in Europe they drink it”.Let's clear this up, shall we? How, exactly, am I supposed to pronounce the word "pecan". PEE-can? Puh-CAHN? PEE-cahn? I find myself in the puh-CAHN camp, but I'm always uncomfortable saying that word in front of others. (#firstworldproblems)
And don't get me started on "apricot"...
Well, however you pronounce it, pecans make a truly excellent addition to these banana muffins. And there are oats, just for good measure. I keep dreaming that I swap the pecans out for chocolate chips, but then I can't make myself do it. Everything just blends together so perfectly. Even hubby, who doesn't like nuts in baked goods, concedes that these are excellent, nuts and all.
I am a BIG fan.
They are my current breakfast obsession, accompanied by a big glass of chocolate almond milk. Mm mm mm mm MM! Breakfast of champions.
Banana Nut & Oat Muffins
adapted from In Sock Monkey Slippers
Ingredients:
2 1/4 c. flour
1/2 tsp. salt
1/2 tsp. baking soda
1 1/2 tsp. baking powder
3 large, very ripe bananas, well mashed
1/2 c. granulated sugar
1/4 c. brown sugar
1/4 c. butter, melted (browned is even better, if you want to go there) and slightly cooled
2 eggs, at room temp.
1/2 c. buttermilk, at room temp.
2 tsp. vanilla
1/2 c. old fashioned oats
1/2 c. chopped pecans
Directions:
Preheat oven to 400º.
In a large mixing bowl, whisk together flour, salt, baking soda, and baking powder. Set aside.
In a separate bowl, mash bananas, then add sugars, butter, and eggs, one at a time. Whisk in vanilla and buttermilk.
Pour banana mixture into flour mixture and gently fold until only a few streaks of flour remain. Add oats and pecans, reserving a couple Tbsp. of each to garnish tops of muffins if desired. Gently fold until just incorporated.
Using a standard-size (3 oz. or 1/4 c.) ice cream scoop, divide among lined and lightly greased muffin tins. Sprinkle on reserved oats and nuts. Place in oven on center rack, and reduce heat to 375º.
Bake for 16 - 20 minutes, or until toothpick comes out cleanly.
Remove from pans immediately and let cool. (Or eat them as soon as they won't burn you. Your call, really.)
Makes about 16.
Goodmorning Christyn..I really like your sweet blog and your recipes...Iam Kate from Greece and i want to invite you to my blog..
Thanks for your comment, Kate! I'll have to check out your site. :D
Your muffins look so delicious - perfect breakfast food. In England I think everyone calls them pee-cans, so luckily I can avoid your dilemma! (I like the way puh-cahn sounds though!)
Thanks, Rosie! I envy your ease of pronunciation choice. ;D
I'm originally from SW Missouri. I say puh-cahn. Been a family debate for as long as I can remember. Lol Just made these muffins tonight to have for breakfast in the morning but they may not last that long. Even a win with my picky 3 year old! Thanks for the recipe! You can definitely add me to your reader list!
Thanks for your comment, Tiffany! That made me smile. This one is a hit with toddlers for sure. My kiddo LOVES them!August 29, 2012
NEC, Northeastern University Present Harry Partch Symposium and Festival, September 19—21
Events Include Concerts, Seminars, Instrument Workshop
Partch’s Collection of Idiosyncractic Instruments on Display and in Demonstrations
New England Conservatory and Northeastern University are teaming up to present a major reexamination of the music of Harry Partch and his influence on musical composition, September 19—21. Highlights of the festival, The Harry Partch Legacy: Microtonal Constructions and Intercultural Dialogues will be the exhibition of Partch’s own unique handcrafted instruments, for which he wrote many of his works, presentations by music scholars, interactive workshops, films, and demonstrations by performers expert in playing the instruments. These and several musical performances will take place at both NEC and Northeastern. Composer, musicologist, author, and Bard College faculty Kyle Gann will give the keynote speech, Partch On the Road: The Kerouac of music, September 19 at 9:15 am in NEC’s Jordan Hall.
Partch (1901—1974), instrument building, and western musical genres.
Although widely known, he is at the same time one of the least performed 20th century composers—mainly due to those one-of-a-kind instruments. Sporting such picturesque names as bloboys, cloud chamber bowls, chromelodeon, eucal blossom, marimba eroica and zymo-xyl, these “contraptions” (a term Partch himself used) are difficult to transport, and they require performers with specialized knowledge of how the composer intended them to be used. For this symposium and festival, many of the instruments will travel from New Jersey to NEC's Jordan Hall, with the help of their custodian, Dean Drummond. Visitors will be able to examine them and hear them used in concert. Scholars will gather to explore the continuing impact of Partch’s work.
The symposium and festival are funded in part by a grant from The Harry Partch Foundation.
All events are free and open to the public.

SPIES
By Michael Frayn.
261 pp. New York:
Metropolitan Books/
Henry Holt & Company. $23.
MICHAEL FRAYN is a master of the intellectual mystery masquerading as ripping popular entertainment. ''Copenhagen,'' his wildly successful 1998 play, turned the still-contentious question of what Werner Heisenberg said to Niels Bohr in that city in 1941 into a powerfully driving drama, with characters who lectured on physical principles like uncertainty and quantum mechanics even as they enacted them. ''Headlong,'' his widely read 1999 novel, a comedy of country manners and city wiles, concerned a grimy picture that may or may not have been a Bruegel, with a potted history of the Netherlands in the 16th century and disquisitions on the difference between iconology and iconography and other tweedy subjects thrown in for good measure. Even Frayn's sublime front-stage/backstage farce, ''Noises Off'' (1982), recently revived on Broadway, can be appreciated as a rollicking meditation on chaos, artifice, the ambiguity of language and the phenomenology of generally falling apart (Frayn is also the author of ''Constructions,'' a book of philosophy), only with slamming doors and outrageous pratfalls instead of footnotes.
''Spies,'' Frayn's 10th novel, involves a decidedly more sober kind of game. It's the third week in June, and a sickly, familiar smell in the air draws an elderly translator to fly to a ''far-off nearby land,'' the England of his childhood. A train takes him the last few miles to a rickety wooden station near a suburban London street identified only as the Close, where ''the same old quiet sweet dull ordinariness'' conceals a dark secret. Back in deepest wartime, the narrator, a teapot-eared boy named Stephen Wheatley, spent a summer playing at the house of his friend Keith. Stephen's own family is awkward and embarrassing: his father is a dull man who works in an anonymous office and dispels any disagreeable situation at home with bizarre expressions. Keith's house, on the other hand, is a tidy fortress of English propriety and composure, presided over by a marmoreally composed mother and patrolled by a jolly authoritarian of a father, who calls his son ''old bean'' and keeps the bayonet he wielded to ''run through'' five Germans while an officer in the Great War.
Mostly, Keith and Stephen's games consist of boyish contributions to the war effort: construction of an imaginary railway line from the flower beds to the air-raid shelter, explorations of a nearby house gutted by a German incendiary bomb with its tenant still inside, a wary eye kept on another broken-down house recently taken over by a shadowy entity called ''the Juice'' (read ''Jews''). But then one day Keith blurts out six words that change everything -- My mother is a German spy.'' Soon the boys are reading her diary, watching her through the vines entangling their secret backyard hideaway, recording in a notebook her baffling comings and goings from the market or the mailbox or the house of her sister, whose absent husband is one of the airmen writing ''a tangled scribble of heroic vapor trails'' in the sky. And the more they watch, the more strange things do seem to be going on, like the trick of a tired eye. Keith's mother enters one house but then seems to emerge from another, jumping ''back in time'' but ''forward in space'' like ''a hallucination.''
But then again, is simply vanishing and reappearing, which Stephen's father does every weekday, really so strange? To Stephen, it ''seemed a full enough job description for all practical purposes.'' Everything seems perfectly normal, even dull, to the reader too, until a curious gaslight effect starts to take over, cued by the waxing and waning of the moon. One night Stephen wakes up and sees, beyond the heavy blackout curtains, a familiar world that has become, under the full moon, a photo negative of itself, its ordinary plants and houses ''picked out, against a background of velvet darkness, in the most delicately brilliant and unearthly white.'' He goes out alone in the night, that ''almost forgotten time,'' to the tangled hinterlands of the village, its own front, where a puzzling encounter sets in motion a deadly chain of events that climaxes at the next dark of the moon.
Some of the novel's most eerily beautiful passages evoke the landscape of the town itself, a train-set Potemkin village recently carved out of wild country and mapped out in districts known only as the Close, Paradise, the Lanes and the Barns, a desolate cluster of collapsed farm buildings at the edge of the known world. When the adult Stephen returns, he finds ''the familiar world has reached out and sealed the underworld away beneath the well-drained and well-lit surfaces. Light has joined up with light, and the haunted darkness between them has been abolished.'' But in his memory the old world remains with its terrors, like the ragged children of the Lanes with their menacing dogs and the sinister, metallic words like ''colonization'' that keep cropping up. And then there is Stephen's increasing preoccupation with ''germs'' (read ''Germans''), a fear that gets mixed up with his budding sexuality, which itself is somehow wrapped up with his emerging complicity with Keith's mother, his father's odd exclamations, the telltale slime on the walls of the tunnel linking the Close to the Lanes and the Barns beyond.
The transformation of the landscape, plowed up by bombs and bulldozers and then planted with full postwar suburbanization, is a process echoed in the actions of Stephen's memory. ''What do we see from our vantage point in the meantime? Or dream that we see, or imagine that we see, or imagine later that we remembered seeing?'' he asks as he reconstructs the story. The many such passages of narrative self-questioning have a certain heaviness after a while, as does some of Frayn's symbolism, like the mysterious X's in Keith's mother's calendar that recur with the new moon and that reappear as the occult sign on an old tin discovered near the Barns, and then become the pleasurable, nauseating kisses Stephen gets from someone who turns out to be spying on him.
Like ''Copenhagen,'' ''Spies'' is a backward-looking meditation on an ambiguous encounter, half-remembered, half-imagined, that begins in friendship and spirals out into a galaxy of questions of loyalty, guilt and complicity, the unknowability of others and the strange dark matter at the fringes of the self. At the novel's climax, the narrator says of his boy-self, ''I really have no idea, as I try to piece all this together half a century later, whether he understood or not.'' At this point readers may think they get it, but then Frayn lays the answer out in an overexplicit coda, tying up loose ends we may have barely noticed were there. The novel ends up turning on an entirely different mystery from the comings and goings of Keith's mother. As someone puts it directly to Stephen: ''So why you? Why did she pick you?'' If the answer seems forced, the asking has a gorgeous melancholy that shivers the mind.

Tattoos lose their taboo, become more popular with women
- From: adelaidenow
- February 17, 2013
ONCE associated with bikies and sailors, tattoos have become a mainstream way to express individuality.
Social researcher Mark McCrindle says heavily inked men and women sporting extensive tattoos such as sleeves, where an entire arm is covered in elaborate designs, have become such a common sight they rarely warrant a second glance.
"The growth of tattoos has become one of the key trends of the 21st century. They've lost their stigma and are hugely popular with men and women in the middle class," he says.
"I think women in particular are using tattoos as a way to mark something, such as the birth of a child in a very public and meaningful way," he says.
The tribal armbands in vogue a decade ago have been replaced by names, dates, quotes and more feminine patterns.

Comment 3 of 3A Dutch Jewish watchdog group reported a 23 percent increase in the number of anti-Semitic incidents last year in the Netherlands.
The Hague-based Center for Information and Documentation on Israel (CIDI) recorded 147 anti-Semitic incidents in the Netherlands in 2013, compared with 114 in the previous year. CIDI’s annual report was released Tuesday.
Verbal assaults on Jews that involved a direct exchange rose to 21 from 14. Three incidents involved direct physical violence, and one case featured threats of violence.
“CIDI finds the increase all the more disconcerting because it is partly caused by frequent confrontations between victims and perpetrators,” the organization said in statement.Tagged Photos

whaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaat the heeeeeeeeeeck…. is there even a point to painting that good?
There is NO WAY those are paintings!!..
My mind wass blown at first too, but they are! Oil on canvas!
I´m done. Envy.
-TC-
I can’t… I don’t believe it. Those must be very well photoshopped pictures.
They are real! Oil on canvas! Mind blowing :O
That first one is really good. The last one you see it a tiny bit
Modern day Norman Rockwell!
wtf wtf wtf wt fwt fwtfw
nice waste of time.
I definately tip my hat to this guy, forget HD tv….hes doin HD PAINTINGS
that doesn’t even make sense
They kind of look like 3d renders.
Do you know anything about the process? Surely he must have a photo(s) to work from?
Yes, he uses high quality pictures to look at and I think projects them onto his canvas to trace, but he does do all the painting himself. Oil on canvas! It’s insane
WHAT?
I think we all need to get together, find this man and beat him senseless.
hooooooooow?
he’s very patient I must admit, but i don’t like those painings – we have cameras to do photos. it’s completly soulless.
The first one >>work in progress <>work in progress <<
Shit. Thats awesome!
thats incredibly. but i agree with jaca
even if it’s really awesome, i agree with Jaca too.
maybe that’s his point. I dunno. Maybe that’s the reaction he wanted.
“Shit! those are paintings! No way??” “What’s the point?” “There is no soul. we can use cameras for that.”
Since most of the subjects are mundane objects that show how material our life is.. Maybe he was tryin to make a statement, IMO
yeah, it’s really impressive… but I think I would like a lot more if it came with the concept, I mean, nobody does that kind of painting without a really strong concept, knowing that it will be judged as “complete waste of time” (I agree with that, at least, for now). I admit that the concept is clear once you think about it, BUT, still, pop art did that a long time ago.
Student, I do agree with you…. IT MUST have a concept, but, is it enough? Even if the artist is expecting this kind of reaction, WHO IN THE WORLD WOULD HAVE THAT KIND OF TROUBLE to make realistic paintings like that, just to receive a weak response? These paintings give you something to think about… but just for 5 minutes. Is the juice worth the squeeze?
^ yea great points. i feel the same way when i see any photorealistic painting to be on honest, even when they are fantastic portraits of people and not these mundane everyday things – and especially when they are copied from an identical photograph.
i do find the magazine rack interesting and perhaps its the one that leads me to believe Bernardi is attempting to make a statement, similar to what Student mentioned. the craft here is incredible i wouldn’t hang them on my wall though.
Gotta give him credit, he’s probably the most controversial/talked about artist ever posted on booom?
You should post more stuff like this jeff. Make people think beyond “i like this” or “meh”
the Valerie Hegarty post remains the most debated – 70 comments or something

This is Caraaaazily purrrrrrrrrrrrfect, how os that a painting!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!8o
He does take the photograph and then transcribes it (perhaps from slide, perhaps using the grid system), but I think the point of it is to take the concept of actually freezing a moment in time that actually happened from the monopoly of photography and brings back some of the glory to oil paint.
First and last ones are photos. They are the photos he will use to paint from. I don’t know why he posts them as “work in progress”.
helkarava – good one.kinda agree, but if it’s your passion to get done shits we see us around in that HQ on paper.. with color ,than .. do it. and he does it in MAX HQ still WTF !
i’m sure we all wish we could do what this guy can do. agree?
wow..THIS IS 4D
wooooooooooooow
very gooooooooooooooood.
hi it s very good x
No, this is not a photo, i saw 1st painting just last week at Bernaducci.Meisel Gallery, exactly the same as it is above. It is photorealism, due to the advantage of technology, some artists use photograph and projector on canvas and some artist use in addition an airbrush tool. Examples are Bernardo Torrens and Hubert de Lartigue.
VERY GOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOD.

No one wants to believe that a man capable of writing books that can move the human spirit or of producing beautiful paintings is capable of murder. At the least, we would prefer to believe that such men surely change for the better as they age. Having been raised a Southern Baptist, I was taught to believe in deathbed conversions, just as you were.
That shared belief in the power of repentance is the reason I'm writing you this open letter. There are those who truly change, but we must look carefully to determine the genuine from the counterfeit.
There is a vast difference between true repentance and merely saying what others wish to hear. My concern is shared by special agents of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, who -- for perhaps the first time in history -- have taken to the streets with a public protest and a petition prepared for you, signed by thousands of active and former special agents.
As I write this letter, you have before you a request to pardon Leonard Peltier, a former American Indian Movement activist now serving life in a federal prison for the murder of two FBI agents, Ronald A. Williams and Jack R. Coler, who died on duty at the tragically early ages of 27 and 28.
You and I, Mr. President, also share the experience of having grown up in the same tumultuous period of political protest. Each of us in his own way has stood up to be counted, as did Ronald Williams and Jack Coler. After more than a decade of social activism, my fate led me into a relatively late career in law enforcement while yours took you all the way to the White House.
I have seen social activism from both sides, as an activist and a law enforcement officer and I can tell you that those who took up violence at a time when you and I were working for peaceful change within the system were of a different breed, already inclined towards vile acts of aggression before they cloaked themselves in righteous causes.
Much has been made of the fact that Leonard Peltier was poor and a high school dropout. Many of us were poor and struggled to educate ourselves but did not choose a path of violence. Most managed to survive and thrive without ever having physically harmed another human being.
There are those who make much of the fact that Peltier's initial act of violence against a Milwaukee police officer failed because of a malfunctioning weapon. They say that all else that befell him afterwards should be pardoned because they were a direct result of that youthful and misguided attack on what he viewed as an oppressive system.
Mr. President, weapons do sometimes misfunction. I know, because I've been there. But the mechanical failure of a firearm does not mitigate murderous intent.
On June 26, 1975, at least 125 rounds were fired from high-powered rifles by Leonard Peltier and his accomplices at agents Williams and Coler while they were engaged in doing their job. After being rendered helpless from the rifle fire, both agents were executed at close range by shots to the head, in the same manner that wounded animals are dispatched. This is the record of the trial that has held up through appeal after appeal.
Several years ago, I read a moving book by a death row inmate convicted of murdering a police officer as he lay helpless, a case very much like the one in which you are being asked to issue a pardon. Though a veteran police officer, I was so touched by the beauty of the writing, I could not believe the man who had written the book was capable of cold-blooded murder. But I was wrong. As in the Peltier case before you, that other case has withstood the intensive scrutiny of time and unending legal actions.
Artistic talent is not given only to the righteous. I have now lived long enough to understand that even methodical murderers are quite capable of producing richly creative works of art. And prior repentance is not necessary for the creation of such art.
Not that Peltier has repented. In fact, he still touts himself as a heroic member of a persecuted minority, who acted in self defense against a cruel and oppressive society. That our society has been cruel and oppressive at times is undeniable, as we both well know. The only question in Peltier's case, however, is whether murder is a justification for past injustices.
Mr. President, the answer to that question is a resounding "no." Peltier may well have done many good deeds since being imprisoned as his supporters claim. His victims, however, were denied the opportunity of ever again doing good deeds because they died senselessly at such young ages.
Whether you are considering, or have seriously considered a pardon for Leonard Peltier, I do not know. What I do know is that he murdered two human beings, one of whom had his hand protectively raised in front of his face when he was shot.
Please make sure that Leonard Peltier continues to produce his art behind prison walls. It's the safest thing for the rest of us.
And it is justice, if there ever was justice...08 Mar

The story lines are abound for the Carolina Hurricanes Thursday morning heading into their matchup against the Detroit Red Wings.
There’s the whole thing of Nathan Gerbe coming back to Michigan, where he’s from. Which is kind of neat, since he has only played there in the regular season once in his career before this. As humanly interesting as this tidbit may be, it only gives Fox Sports color commentator Tripp Tracy something else to talk about during the game other than the game; which he is famous for — because he is awful.
Losing forward Alexander Semin to a concussion is also being brought up. This is another distraction, however, since Semin is pretty far away from “irreplaceable.” In fact, he’s pretty far from “useful” these days. As desperately as the Hurricanes PR department is trying to get people to care about this, it’s not working. Semin being out is another non-issue.
Only two things should be discussed as far as the Hurricanes’ lineup is concerned: Jeff Skinner and Cam Ward.
Skinner is finally returning from his Oct. 24 upper-body injury, having been officially activated Thursday morning. Not only is his return solidified, but head coach Kirk Muller has him placed on the top line — in Semin’s spot — with Eric Staal and Jiri Tlusty. The only way this decision can backfire is if the power goes out in Joe Louis Arena and the game has to be canceled. Having a Skinner-Staal-Tlusty top line is such a no-brainer, it’s insane to think it wasn’t the first thing Muller did in October. Putting grind-it-out Staal with the run-and-gun Tlusty and Skinner should have been a clause in Muller’s contract.
Where does that leave Semin? Who cares. There’s three other lines he can skate on, it’ll be figured out.
Then there’s the whole Ward vs. Justin Peters madness. Who should start, who should be traded, etc.
Fact: Ward has started in one game since being re-activated. One. A single game. Against the Boston Bruins – who are actually really good. Ward’s one loss to Boston had almost nothing to do with Ward.
Yet, somehow this logic is lost on Muller, who confirmed Thursday afternoon that Peters would get the start over Ward. This is the dumbest idea since the McDLT. Ward is an elite goaltender and faltered in a single game. One game. While it’s true Peters is on a hot streak, something else is true: Ward won’t get any better sitting on a bench.
Carolina is comfortable enough in the Metropolitan Division standings that they can throw Ward in there and have it be OK. When your franchise goaltender just came off of a very long injury, takes a loss in his first game not due to lack of talent and gets benched for an AHL replacement — that’s as comforting as steel wool.
Skinner on the top line is the good news. Ward riding the bench is the face palm. Gerbe coming home to Michigan is the “aww.” Semin out of the lineup is the distraction. Somewhere in all of this, Carolina has a hockey game to win.

Audi TTS "Shelley" Autonomous CarEnlarge Photo
Racing is a great way to demonstrate the latest technologies developed by companies. In1985 Audi convinced America that all-wheel-drive was practical when it won at the Pikes Peak International Hill Climb using their a Sport Quattro S1. Now Audi is returning to one of the oldest motorsport events to demonstrate their Autonomous TTS.
The project is part of a partnership between Audi, The Oracle Corporation, and Standford University’s Dynamic Design Lab. The group chose the TTS for its exciting sportiness, as well as for the computer friendly drive-by-wire system and DSG gearbox. It uses two computers, one system controls conveys the car’s placement and how safely it’s going solely using GPS and the car’s traction control system, while the other uses this information to operate the car.
The Pikes Peak race was chosen as it will challenge the Autonomous TTS. The course is 12.42 miles of road consisting of pavement and gravel, 156 turns, 4,271 feet of elevation change, and seven percent grades. The car won’t be going as slow as it shows in the video either; they plan to actually race the car up to the peak just like the ones piloted by people. While there is no word as to what class it would be under, it will more than likely be in the Exhibition Car category which emphasizes new technologies.
The TTS is done up in the classic Audi factory livery, and pays homage to the Sport Quattro S1 that dominated the competition 25 years ago. Later, the project will head to El Mirage to set a land speed record for fastest automated car.
[Source: Audi]SAN ANTONIO, Sept. 11, 2013 /PRNewswire-iReach/ -- The main focus of hybrids is fuel economy, so it's not surprising that many of the available hybrids are sedans, one of the most common body types in the automotive market. However, in the 2014 Honda CR-Z, Honda has taken two doors and three seats away, leaving one of the sportiest looking hybrids available. The 2014 CR-Z is a two-passenger hatchback coupe which takes away the mundane experience of driving a hybrid and makes it marvelous.
(Photo:)
Consumers can find the only small hybrid with a stick shift in the 2014 CR-Z. When paired with a 1.5-liter engine and 15 kilowatt electric motor, the 6-speed manual transmission of the 2013 CR-Z was capable of a combined 37 mpg fuel economy. The fuel economies in all Honda models that have been released this year have been increased from the 2013 model. That's likely to be the same in the 2014 Honda CR-Z. Consumer complaints about the small size of the 2013 CR-Z are likely to be addressed this year as well. That means a larger interior volume could also come with an upgrade from the 130 horsepower engine that was found under the hood in the 2013 model.
One feature that is expected to make a return is the Plus Sport System complete with an engine-priming button on the steering wheel. Once the button is hit, the engine is juiced up for a burst of speed which can be used to pass slower vehicles, or just for fun. It's a feature that really consumers enjoyed in the 2013 CR-Z, so it's highly likely that the 2014 model will be getting it as well. Other features expected to add to the sporty vibe of the CR-Z again are the textured aluminum sports pedals and the aluminum shift-knob. Consumers are also likely to enjoy that the three-mode driving system isn't expected to go anywhere. The modes alter a variety of different systems in the car to cater to different driving styles.
The future of sports hybrids is the 2014 Honda CR-Z. Get in touch with the professionals at Benson Honda in San Antonio to find out more about this one of a kind hybrid. Their staff is trained and certified in dealing with just about everything Honda.

In French
the name means "bearded chicken from Watermael". Belgian Bantams are “true bantams” having no large counterparts; the
Belgians love their bantams.
Class: Light Bantam
Size: Bantam (only) Male: 22 oz. / Bantam Female: 18 oz.
Comb, Wattles & Earlobes: Rose
Color: over 30
Place of Origin: Belgium or Netherlands
Conservation Status: not in danger
This little chicken from Watermael or Watermaal, is related to another Belgian breed: Bearded d'Anvers but sports a crest of
feathers, small rose comb, clean legs and a lower tail carriage. It’s the smallest of the three prominent breeds: D’uccle,
D’anvers & Watermael.
Barbu d'Uccles, also known as Booted Bantams, are more placid and easy going. They always have a single comb and feathered
legs and are slightly larger than the d'Anvers, but otherwise very similar in characteristics.
Bantam chicken fanciers are busy in this part of the world, producing new breeds and color varieties quite often. This is one of the reasons that this little bird is so well liked and special.

HONG KONG, July 5, 2011 /PRNewswire-Asia/ — Hutchison Global Communications Limited (HGC or the Company), the fixed-line operating division of Hutchison Telecommunications Hong Kong Holdings Limited (SEHK: 215), has extended network reach to the Greater Mekong Subregion (GMS) and established an enhanced presence in Europe, the Middle East and Africa (EMEA). HGC’s customer base in the GMS has increased in size, while the volume of the Company’s voice traffic from EMEA doubled in the first quarter of 2011 compared with the same period last year.
Widening our spectrum of customers in the GMS
HGC’s fully-fledged network and data services were extended to the GMS in January 2010 and now serve the Subregion’s carriers, as well as overseas carriers and enterprises, with extensive and highly-resilient connectivity that links five GMS member countries — Vietnam, Thailand, Laos, Cambodia and Myanmar.
The GMS network offers full diversity via at least two routes between each GMS network connection point and other destinations. It deploys both submarine and terrestrial cables on multiple physical paths. These are connected to HGC’s core global network to provide diverse routes from the GMS to Asia, Europe and the US, as well as to facilitate interconnections throughout Subregion nations.
HGC’s spectrum of business customers in the GMS has widened, mainly as a result of the Company’s ability to meet the upwardly-surging needs of corporate customers seeking to benefit from the Subregion’s rapid economic growth. These include multinational corporations such as manufacturing giants, banking and financial institutions, telecoms operators, news agencies, as well as small and medium enterprises.
Provided Myanmar‘s first IP-VPN service
Andrew Kwok, HGC’s Senior Vice President of International Business, said: “As the first overseas network operator to provide intra-GMS connectivity – characterised by the provision of one-stop-shop solutions, total network diversity and stringent service level agreements, together with connection between the Subregion and rest of the world – we not only enjoy first-mover advantage, but also a higher profit margin as telecoms solutions delivered in unserved and underserved new markets fetch a higher premium compared with those in developed markets.”
HGC ventured into the GMS in 2004, with the design and project management of the world’s first terrestrial cable connectivity between Vietnam and Hong Kong via mainland China, before proceeding to provide Myanmar’s first IP-VPN service in 2008. Network reach has since been extended to other parts of the Subregion. The Company has established local offices in the GMS to provide timely support based on homegrown talent and know-how backed by stringent service level agreements to meet customers’ increasingly sophisticated requirements.
Enhanced presence in EMEA leads to a doubling of voice traffic
In a move to serve the international connectivity needs of Chinese enterprises and other Asian companies as they go global, HGC strengthened its business presence in EMEA by establishing an office in London last December. This has enhanced network connectivity between Asia and Europe and extends the Company’s reach into the Middle East and Africa.
HGC’s business reach of EMEA now includes major African nations such as Egypt and Kenya, as well as Dubai in the Middle East plus Hungary and Scotland in Europe. This enhanced regional presence led to a doubling of the Company’s volume of voice traffic from EMEA for the first quarter of 2011 compared with the corresponding period last year.
Mr Kwok said: “We expect the volume of voice traffic in EMEA to account for approximately one-third of our total voice traffic this year, with the key driver of growth in EMEA being Europe. From a data perspective, we plan to establish new points-of-presence (PoPs) in the region during the second half of 2011 in order to deliver diverse telecoms solutions, especially as more cities in Africa are switching from satellite to fibre connectivity.”
Dedicated service teams in London attract new business
HGC is able to offer multiple gigabits of capacity on Hong Kong westbound routes, as well as transpacific and transatlantic cable systems on Hong Kong eastbound routes, to provide diverse network connectivity between Asia and Europe via its PoP in London. The Company’s highly-meshed global network architecture and extensive bandwidth scalability attracted new clients and broadened its EMEA customer base.
A prime example is HGC’s recent provision of connectivity to European broadcasters in order to facilitate live coverage of the 2011 Formula 1(TM) events in Shanghai and Malaysia. Further Asia-based sporting events will see HGC providing yet more international connectivity and bandwidth solutions to meet the demanding needs of customer organisations in EMEA.
The new office in London, headed by HGC’s Ravindran Mahalingam, General Manager of EMEA Region – International Business, delivers the Company’s full portfolio of telecoms solutions to EMEA. Given a closer proximity to the region, HGC is now able to serve customer organisations in EMEA with round-the-clock technical support in similar time zones.
Extension of HGC’s fully-meshed network and telecoms services to the GMS, along with deeper penetration of EMEA, look set to generate greater international business growth, while sharpening the Company’s competitive edge and strengthening our market leadership.

Most recently, minimally invasive approaches have been applied to pancreas surgery, including the use of the da Vinci® robot. These minimally invasive approaches allow for smaller incisions, a shorter hospital stay and a quicker return to normal activities.
Specifically, robotic technology offers obvious advantages in pancreatic surgery by enabling more precise dissection and superior suturing along major vessels, which allows for spleen-preservation when possible. This results in:

A time when hearts are broken, dreams are shattered and players come of age.
For Drury's Molly Moulton, it's more about playing beyond her years in one of the more pressure-packed situations the game has to offer: free-throw shooting.
Don't let her calm demeanor completely fool you, though. She knows what's at stake.
"It depends. If it's a close game, I get a little nervous," she conceded.
Maybe it's just the gym at Monument Mountain Regional High School, but the sophomore is almost a sure thing from the line in the fourth quarter.
In her first postseason game, Moulton made 9 of 16 free throws in the final frame to finish with a game-high 16 points. All 16 came from the free-throw line. In the two games Drury played at Monument, she made 26 of 35 attempts.
Her approach is quite simple, a good bet as to why she's so successful at the line.
"I just try to make it to get the lead up and help my teammates out," she said.
Coach Jay Meehan couldn't pinpoint a moment during the regular season where he gained almost absolute confidence in his little sharp-shooter down the stretch. Perhaps that's because he knew the team would need contributions from everyone to make a postseason run, or maybe it's because Moulton has been performing in the clutch all season long.
Whatever the reason or combination thereof, Meehan continuously put the ball in Moulton's hands down the stretch when the win was anything but secure.
The reason is two-fold.
"Yes because A, she's a good free-throw shooter. And B, she draws a lot of fouls," Meehan said. "She's going to get fouled nine times out of 10. She has put up a ton of free throws all year, not just in these three Monument games."
The consistency she showed in the second quarter, making six straight and 7 of 8 wavered for the first 7:30, but didn't falter in the dying seconds.
Moulton never made more than two straight in her first 10 attempts of the fourth quarter. She missed her 11th and 12th attempts with her team leading 45-39 with 33.5 seconds left. She didn't miss from that point on, stretching the six-point lead to an insurmountable 10-point advantage.
Moulton's older sister, Emily, a senior on the team, opted to not give a long drawn-out speech about what to expect in the postseason.
"I just told her she had to keep her head up and follow through," Emily Moulton said. "It's big for her to shoot up because if it goes flat ... It has to go up. She's a small little thing."
Molly Moulton's sharp shooting from the foul line helped power Drury into the Western Massachusetts Division III quarterfinals against top-seeded Sabis. Free throws may not be as important as they were against Monument, but in the postseason, it's always a good idea to take the easy points, just in case they turn out to be crucial.
"You just have to practice them everyday," she said, "so it's just routine when it comes down to games like this."

July 2 (Bloomberg) -- BNP Paribas SA, France’s largest bank, may narrow a 40 billion-euro ($50 billion) funding gap in Spain and Italy by moving some loans in those countries to deposit-rich Belgium, three people with knowledge of the matter said.
The bank is seeking to tighten the mismatch of loans and deposits in European countries by the transfer of export-lending and project-finance portfolios to Belgium, the people said, citing Chief Financial Officer Lars Machenil at a meeting last month in Paris. The bank also studied moving commodities-finance assets to Switzerland, they said, declining to be identified because the discussions aren’t public.
“It isn’t easy to lend to Spanish companies without having enough deposits locally,” said Christophe Nijdam, an analyst at AlphaValue in Paris. “That’s why they’d look for funding elsewhere.”
BNP Paribas is looking to address funding concerns in Spain and Italy, where the Paris-based bank’s loans outweighing deposits was among reasons cited by Moody’s Investors Service for downgrading its credit rating last month. Transfers of loans from elsewhere to Belgium might be capped at 20 billion euros and at 10 billion Swiss francs ($10.4 billion) to Switzerland, according to one of the people.
BNP Paribas, like other lenders in Europe, is trying to match assets and liabilities on a country basis as local bank supervisors try to “trap” more capital and funding at a national level, Morgan Stanley analysts including London-based Huw Van Steenis wrote in a report on June 26.
Pulling Back
The four largest banks in France provide 150 billion euros of parent funding for their European peripheral activities, the report said. By transferring export-finance operations from Spain and Italy to Belgium -- with its deposit surplus -- BNP Paribas would be able to cut its parent funding.
The bank’s shares rose as much as 5.5 percent and were 3.9 percent higher at 31.53 euros as of 5:16 p.m. in Paris.
BNP Paribas spokesman Pascal Henisse declined to comment on remarks made by CFO Machenil and on the 20 billion-euro estimate for the bank’s funding shortfall in Spain, which two of the people said almost matched the lender’s figure for Italy.
Henisse said in an e-mailed response to questions that retail banking in Belgium, conducted through BNP Paribas’s Fortis Bank SA/NV unit, already includes operations from Luxembourg, Poland, Turkey and some specialized business.
“As part of its daily treasury activities Fortis Bank is engaged in short-term lending and borrowing activities with BNP Paribas group,” he said. Fortis Bank’s net liquidity to its parent is “very limited,” and was less than 1 billion euros at the end of last year, he said.
Funding Surplus
The attempt to back loans with deposits comes as Europe’s almost three-year-old debt crisis gums up euro-area banks’ efforts to finance operations. BNP Paribas, which has cut its sovereign debt holdings in the region’s troubled countries, is now seeking to shrink cross-border funding of private loans in those countries.
The bank, which took 3.2 billion euros in writedowns on Greek government debt last year, has rushed to cut its sovereign-debt holdings in most European countries except Belgium since mid-2011 to help protect capital levels.
It cut its Italian government debt holdings by 43 percent to 11.6 billion euros in the 10 months through April 30.
While as a group BNP Paribas says it has a funding surplus, the bank has shortfalls between loans and deposits in some of its main countries.
Italian Aid
At the end of March, BNP Paribas had a 51 billion-euro surplus of stable funding on its cash balance sheet, helped by rising medium- and long-term funding resources, according to its website. Based on BNP Paribas figures, customer loans equaled 116 percent of client deposits, according to its May 4 results.
The French bank’s crossborder.
BNL’s commercial-banking loans exceeded deposits by 39.1 billion euros at the end of March, BNP’s website shows.
No aggregate data are available for BNP’s loans and deposits in Spain, where the lender doesn’t operate a consumer-banking network.
Belgian Position
Meanwhile, BNP’s Belgian consumer-banking network had deposits exceeding loans by 15.5 billion euros at the end of March, according to its website.
BNP Paribas, which bought Fortis’s bank assets in Belgium and Luxembourg in 2009, set up a corporate- and investment-banking hub in Brussels for European structured finance, serving Benelux, Northern Central Europe, Greece and Turkey for corporate acquisition finance, export finance and project finance, according to a Dec. 1, 2009 presentation to investors.
Brussels is home to BNP Paribas’s center for overseeing “particular banking services at a European or global level for both large and midsized international companies in their daily banking activities,” the bank said Feb. 10, 2011 as it unveiled “One Bank for Corporates in Europe.” The program provides services to 160,000 European firms at 150 business centers in 23 nations including France, Belgium, Italy, Spain and Switzerland.
Italy, Spain
BNP Paribas’s corporate-banking European services such as cash management and trade finance are housed in Brussels. The bank’s Belgian consumer-banking unit is the country’s largest bank by deposits.
In Italy, BNP Paribas acquired BNL in 2006 for 9 billion euros and it has more than 1,000 outlets. The bank helps Italian companies operating abroad with services such as cash management, trade finance and lending through “Italian desks” active in BNP’s units in other countries.
In Spain, BNP Paribas’s corporate- and investment-banking unit has 340 employees in Madrid, Barcelona, A Coruna, Bilbao and Valencia and 15 billion euros of assets, according to a Spanish presentation on the bank’s website.
Among its Spanish activities, BNP also has a car-fleets leasing operation, a private-banking business and owns 50 percent of mortgage-lender UCI, a venture with Banco Santander SA. UCI manages 11.8 billion euros in assets, the bank said.
Rating Cut
BNP Paribas was among 15 global banks -- including French rivals Credit Agricole SA and Societe Generale SA -- downgraded by Moody’s on June 21. Moody’s action on BNP Paribas was partly prompted by funding needs at the bank’s Rome-based unit BNL.
 May 4. Loans at the Italian retail-banking unit were at 71.3 billion euros by the end of the first quarter, almost unchanged from a year earlier,Jessica Alba Will Be Back for ‘Sin City 2,’ So Let’s Watch Her Strip Scene Again
News recently broke that not only will we finally be getting a sequel to 2005′s badass hit ‘Sin City,’ the very best part (parts?) of that movie—Jessica Alba—will also be back.
The above photo is the first promo shot from ‘Sin City: A Dame to Kill For,’ and once again the Hollywood marketing machine has absolutely nailed it. We will go see this movie. For art.
What this news really is, though, is an excuse for us to post the following video, and if you saw the original ‘Sin City,’ then this performance by Nancy Callahan needs no introduction:<<At both half-time and full-time of a brutal Champions League defeat to Bayern Munich, Arsenal were booed off by their irate fans, only for the more understanding sections of Emirates Stadium to respond compassionately with a delayed show of support. Clearly this remains a club torn between loyalty and dissent – not least when it comes to their manager.
The final judgement on Arsene Wenger’s Arsenal tenure will not solely draw on this game for its body of evidence: it was entirely expected that a far superior Bayern Munich, who have tamed the ebullient Bundesliga, would dominate an Arsenal humbled by Blackburn. And dominate they did. Yet a defeat which effectively ensures Arsene Wenger will suffer an eighth trophyless season still exposed some familiar, unforgivable faults.
An unconvincing defence riven by uncertainty; a team with questionable character and little confidence; and a chronic lack of options provided by a squad that has been eroded of genuine quality quite alarmingly over the past few years.
Seeking a response to a second cup exit at the hands of lower-league opposition on Saturday, Arsenal enjoyed five minutes of promise at the start of the game, roared on by an unusually vocal home crowd. But after both Santi Cazorla and Theo Walcott whipped in dangerous crosses – the first of which forced Manuel Neuer into the rarest of things for the Bayern keeper: a save – the Germans ruthlessly punctured any nascent optimism in the home support.
As an enthusiasm killer, Toni Kroos’s thumping volley that kicked up off the turf and rose out of the reach of Wojciech Szszesny after seven minutes was every bit as deflating as Park Ji-Sung’s strike after eight minutes in a semi-final defeat to Manchester United here in 2009. That match also ended 3-1, Arsenal outclassed by a weightier, more accomplished, more powerful rival. It has become a familiar fate.
Jupp Heynckes's lavishly gifted Bayern side are certainly worthy of comparison with teams of the stature of Manchester United and Barcelona. A 20-minute spell and one aberration aside – Manuel Neuer’s decidedly un-German walkabout for Arsenal’s goal – the team 15 points clear in the Bundesliga were everything they promised to be. Classy and composed in defence, authoritative in midfield, fluid and precise in attack and flanked by two tireless, dangerous full-backs in David Alaba and the inestimable Philipp Lahm, this is a team perfectly calibrated and balanced for the rigours of the elite modern game.
Watching Bayern overwhelm Arsenal in the first half – particularly in midfield where Javi Martinez and Bastian Schweinsteiger’s initiative and vigour in a deeper role provided the foundation for Kroos to manoeuvre stylishly – was to watch a team utterly confident in their own ability and identity; drilled, disciplined and deadly. The sort of team that, it seems, Arsenal may never again be under Wenger.
Bayern were helped by some poor defending. Thomas Mueller’s goal from a corner was avoidable, while Mario Mandzukic’s third exposed the grand fragility that was Arsenal’s left flank: all Bayern’s goals came from that side, with the out-of-position and out-of-sorts Thomas Vermaelen offered little protection by Lukas Podolski and then, following a tactical reshuffle, Santi Cazorla in the second half.
The way Mario Mandzukic was left completely free from another Lahm cross from the Bayern right to head wide in the first half was perhaps the most vivid example of Arsenal's tenuous grasp of the art of defending. Heynckes put it succinctly enough: "It was just easy for my team to play."
Wenger, whose anger flared up briefly again in his post-match press conference, only to be replaced by a more sanguine outlook, admitted: “The nerves played a big part. The results bring confidence. It’s a bit of a vicious circle. The players gave absolutely everything. We played against a side who have no doubt at all. They have a history in the last six months where everything is positive, every player is confident to play with full power. That’s not the same for us at the moment. But things can change quickly. In three weeks, we can do it.”
They can't. Bayern have conceded three times only once this season, and only once - Lukas Podolski's opportunistic header - in 2013. They are invulnerable, whereas a decidedly mortal Arsenal have just lost their sixth home game of the season - the most since the turbulent 1996-97 campaign which heralded Wenger's arrival. A different age, in so many ways.
These are two teams separated by a gulf in technical quality and strength. With Mueller at his elusive best, Bayern could enjoy the luxury of having Arjen Robben on the bench, where he sat alongside Mario Gomez - not everyone's idea of a top level striker but a man with an enviable goalscoring record nonetheless given he has almost 100 goals in three-and-a-half seasons with the club.
Meanwhile, Wenger's apparent distrust of Olivier Giroud last night meant Arsenal had to start a stranded and subdued Theo Walcott in attack, because a team engaged in a bitter fight for fourth has mystifyingly left themselves with no other senior strikers. Quality has been dripping out of this Arsenal side for years, never adequately replaced. They have few options beyond the first XI, as that loss to Blackburn proved, and Wenger must take responsibility for this situation - whatever the scale of the financial constraints he has faced.
In truth, after a night when Santi Cazorla played far below his best, Arsenal's only saving grace was Jack Wilshere, again. A combative first half was followed by a more impressive second, one cute turn away from Schweinsteiger and drive forward demonstrating that of all the Arsenal players on show, only Hertfordshire's finest would have any hope of commanding a place in this brilliant Bayern team.
Flinging his arms up in frustration at a mistake from Per Mertesacker and berating his team-mates following sloppy passes, Wilshere was the only player to look capable of dragging Arsenal out of their malaise, to drive them forward with any kind of convincing intent. But it will take more than just Wilshere, however willing he may be, to alter Arsenal's course.
It will take a defence who knows how to defend, it will take deeper reserves of fortitude and it will take an infusion of genuine quality. The belief that Wenger is the man to provide these vital ingredients grows weaker by the week, and last night only suggested that the boos from the home fans will grow ever louder, as support continues to ebb sadly away.

Now, it is found. Thanks to a dedicated Delaware historian, a 79-year-old ex-coach and a dead man named C. Rollin Jones, we can suddenly see the picture of the way it was in 1890, the year a new state religion dug its cleats into a meadow next to Dishwater Run.
Let us step back in time.
In the spring of 1890, George Cole, an undergraduate student, convinced Alexander S. Lilley that he, Lilley, was perfect for the job of football coach at Ohio State University. At the time, there was no football team, so this sort of thing was possible -- an undergraduate could hire a coach.
Imagine if sophomores still had that type of power. Or, freshmen.
Anyway, Lilley organized the squad, put it on oxcarts (or such like) and followed the Olentangy on up to Delaware. Within this fair town, on a site within a quarter-mile of the birthplace of the 19th president, the Buckeyes played their first-ever game on May 3, 1890.
It was, of course, a Saturday.
Their opponent was a crew of sturdy Methodists from Ohio Wesleyan University, which was an old hand at the sport. The Bishops had been playing, unofficially, for a couple of years. The Buckeyes, presumably underdogs, pulled off the upset, 20-14.
Where did the staunch lads engage in this epic battle?
Ah, that is the question.
Nobody thought to mark the spot during the Harrison (Benjamin, not William Henry) administration. Why go to the trouble? What the heck was football back then? It's not like this silly game had the same promise as, say, electricity.
Within a few years, the Bishops moved their field to another part of campus -- a rockier part, yes, but a place where they wouldn't keep losing their footballs in the creek. Time passed. Chic Harley was born in 1895. Paul Brown was born in 1908. Wayne Woodrow Hayes was born in 1913. Ohio Stadium opened in 1922. If anyone remembered where the first game was played, they weren't much worried about it. They were looking ahead.
The site of the first-ever game de-pixilated, one dot at a time, from the collective memory bank.
Brent Carson, 58, is a retired middle school social studies teacher and a practicing historian of some repute in the area.
Last year, Carson read with interest a story, by Dispatch columnist Bob Hunter, about the dedication of a plaque in the parking lot of a Giant Eagle grocery store in German Village, on the corner of Whittier and Jaeger Streets. The plaque marked the location of Ohio State's second-ever game -- its first home game. There was a big to-do. Jim Tressel offered words. The band played.
Hunter, closet historian in his own right, lauded the celebration. He also pointed out that the German Village site marked the spot for Game No. 2. And he lamented that no one knew the location of No. 1, save for the fact that it was in Delaware.
Carson read this and thought, "If anyone knows, Dick Gordin knows."
Dick Gordin, 79, is half an answer to an interesting trivia question. Who are the only two Ohio Wesleyan graduates who became athletic director at their alma mater? Answer: Branch Rickey and Gordin.
Gordin is OWU's unofficial sports historian, and he's well qualified because he has seen about a third of that history with his own eyes. Some of it, he was a part of -- as a baseball player, as a coach of numerous teams, as the originator of the OWU soccer program, as athletic director.
The rest, he can look up.
Carson called Gordin and asked, "Do you know where the Ohio State-OWU game was played?"
Indeed, Gordin had the smoking memo.
"There's this letter, from a man named C. Rollin Jones, and it's in our archives," Gordin said. "I've read it a hundred times. It has landmarks."
C. Rollin Jones played for the Bishops on May 3, 1890. He also participated in OWU's centennial celebration 52 years later, in 1942. He might have given an address. He might have written a personal note to athletic director George Gauthier (who, as OWU football coach, beat Michigan and Syracuse in 1928). In any case, there is a letter in the university archives, a letter written by Jones that describes exactly where the field was when the Bishops put their honor on the line against the Buckeyes, and were upset.
"It's right here," Gordin said as he swept his hand out in front of him. "Can you see it?"
Carson, by Gordin's side, beamed.
This was 10:15 a.m., last Wednesday. The sky was achingly blue, the sun was bright and climbing and a hint of breeze was whispering in the pines.
Gordin is correct. The field is there. You barely have to squint to picture it.
"See?" Gordin said.
OWU has swallowed up blocks and blocks of Delaware as it has expanded over 165 years. But here, in one of the oldest corners of campus -- not 50 yards from where the Barber Tavern, the first structure in the city's American history, stood in 1808 -- the greensward remains untouched.
Imagine that. The place is not only preserved, it feels, dare we say, hallowed.
The Delaware Run -- a creek that students used to call Dishwater Run, and across which a rope would be slung every autumn so that the sophomores could have a tug-of-war against the beanie-wearing freshmen -- marks the north side of the field.
A monument marking the sulfur spring -- a tourist destination before the accompanying hotel sold out to the Methodists, who opened a college on the site in 1842 -- marks the south side of the field.
On the east side, where one end zone was situated, there's a semicircular parking lot that runs on and off of Henry Street.
To the west, the lawn gently rolls uphill, until it hits Sandusky Street. There is a stand of pines guarding the area that must have been one of the end zones. Other trees have risen on the field over the past century, including persimmon, maple, chestnut, sweetgum, sycamore, oak and, yes, even Aesculus glabra -- an Ohio Buckeye tree, stuck right about midfield.
"I'd say that's about 100 yards, from there," Gordin says, turning his head, "to there."
It's not hard to find there on Henry Street, across the street from Selby Field, a grand old stadium in which the Bishops have played since 1929.
You can walk the same turf that George Cole kicked up in another century. And you can think, "Man, what if I could pick the next Ohio State coach."
You can stand on a spot that C. Rollin Jones might have occupied, and you can imagine a conversation.
You: "Jonesey, did that loss hurt?" you say.
CRJ: "Nah. We beat Ohio State in '88, in a friendly, during our commencement games. Unofficial, though."
You: "Jonesey, did you play for Fielding Yost?"
CRJ: "Nah. He took the job here after I graduated. What the heck is a 'point-a-minute' offense?"
If the funding is available, Carson and the Delaware County Historical Society will plant a plaque somewhere on the grounds next year. They hope that this simple act of preserving 100 yards from 117 years ago will elicit smiles from visitors now, and a century from now, and for as long as the bronze can hold a piece of local history -- not to mention the seed of the state's true religion.We see that you do not have JavaScript enabled.

7 Ways to Find Wedding Dress Deals
Like us on Facebook
I recently went wedding dress shopping with a friend of mine at a small boutique full of gorgeous gowns that looked way more expensive than their price tags. When I said as much, the shop's proprietor told me about a bride who'd recently fallen in love with a dress, then decided not to buy it when she learned it was "only $1,500." My jaw dropped.
.
- Seek out samples. Each season, bridal stores buy a selection of styles in sample sizes (usually 8 or 10).
- Go to off-the-beaten path boutiques. Big cities boast designer boutiques from the usual suspects, but you can also find smaller shops carrying gowns from designers whose names you may not recognize but whose dresses are just as lovely —and lower priced. Bonus: shopping at these smaller-name stores can be a much calmer experience!
- Brave the superstore. If calm isn't your concern, save time by stopping by bridal superstores, where you can try on many, many dresses at a variety of price points all at once.
- Browse preowned options online. Most brides wear a wedding dress once, so even a used gown is only gently worn. The web is full of preowned dress sources, like Preowned Wedding Dresses and Save the Dress, where brides sell back their gowns, almost good as new. You can also check Ebay and Etsy for preowned and vintage dress deals.
- Wear an heirloom. Wearing a family heirloom as your "something old" not only saves money, it also adds meaning. If your mom didn't wear a dress you love, consider dresses worn by other friends and family members, including aunts, cousins, and your mom's friends. Many people will be honored to lend their dresses.
- Buy vintage. If you don't have a good vintage option in your family heirlooms, shop vintage shops and used clothing stores. Be sure to check both the wedding dress racks and the vintage formal wear and party dresses. Often with vintage, you'll get the expert craftsmanship of designer wares at a fraction of the price. If you find a dress you love that's not quite your style or size, stores can recommend a tailor who specializes in vintage finds.
- Skip the wedding dresses all together. Brides often joke that as soon as you say "wedding," vendors automatically up the estimate. Especially if you don't want a white gown, or even if you do, shop the formal wear and party dress selections at department stores and boutiques, as well as the bridesmaids' offerings from wedding dress designers.

"But you forget that here, we have the freedom to do things like this. While this act may make people mad, it is the same as the picture used for the story - inflammatory at best. It is merely a symbol of your dislike for something. I say burn it and anything else you want as long as you don't hurt anyone physically in the process and I don't mean "potentially" like Petraeus."

307.How can a political party that calls itself “social democratic”, or even “progressive”, have a leadership campaign go on for several weeks without candidates – as far as I can determine – discussing the damaging force that capitalism has become?
At Davos last month, heads of think tanks and corporations called for the revamping of capitalism because of the destruction the system has wrought.
Even the normally mild-mannered monthly Toronto Life had freelance journalist Jason McBride do a hatched job on dysfunctional capitalism in its March issue in an article entitled Something Rotten on Bay Street.
McBride interviewed prominent economist Roger Martin, Dean of University of Toronto’s Rotman School of Management and author of Fixing the Game.
Writes McBride: “Martin is a great believer in business as ‘an agent of positive change,’ but he argues that business has failed, spectacularly, to fulfill this role, largely because of its misplaced faith in erroneous economic theory: specifically, that the primary purpose of any corporation should be the maximization of shareholder value.”
Why can’t the NDP speak up?
Surely if it is okay for Big Business and one of its leading proponents to slag capitalism, it should be safe for aspiring NDP leadership hopefuls to speak up and join the conversation.
In fact, the NDP itself could benefit greatly from a society-wide discussion concerning the problems caused by capitalism.
If there are no improvements to the neoliberal-style of capitalism practiced now, the NDP – if elected – will come up against the extreme right wing views of powerful corporate bodies. This includes the Canadian Council of Chief Executives, which consists of executives from all of Canada’s most powerful corporations, and the 50-member Canadian Bankers Association.
If these two bodies did not like policies proposed by a new NDP government, they could easily undermine the government’s agenda. Just ask Barack Obama.
At this stage it is highly unlikely that any of the remaining seven NDP candidates will come forward to open-up a discussion on the failures of capitalism.
Journalist Murray Dobbin, in an October 24 article on The Tyee, provided an insightful description of the positions being taken by the three leading candidates:
“If the party chooses one of the front runners, Brian Topp or Thomas Mulcair, it will cement the party's rightward drift and pre-occupation with tactical manoeuvring at a time when world events will make drift of any kind a sideshow,” wrote Dobbin.
Dobbin is supporting former CAW negotiator and MP Peggy Nash for the leadership. He likes Nash because of her excellent grasp of economics and the fact that he believes she can bring together the various social movements the NDP will need if it hopes to defeat the Conservatives.
Even so, it is unlikely that even Peggy Nash will come out and promote the reorganization of capitalism during the race.
Instead of explaining how they would challenge the system, the NDP leadership hopefuls are playing it safe, making proposals that would, at best, reinstate some of hundreds of programs slashed by Harper. Greatly restricted by budget limitations, they also would be able to add few of their own excellent programs.
Starry-eyed by the possibility of forming the next government, the NDP is targeting mushy middle ground voters.
However, if the new leader wanted to try to really shake up Ottawa, s/he could go another way.
A little assertiveness will do better at the polls
The party could adopt a more aggressive stance and target the tens-of-thousands of angry and disgruntled Canadians, many of whom are struggling or being left behind by Harper’s neoliberal policies.
The way in which the public embraced the Occupy Movement in the beginning shows that people know they are being exploited. They are in need of leadership.
The new NDP leader could take a bold step and expand the activities of the riding associations. Most associations have never been fully utilized. They could be turned into activist groups that would, as the saying goes “get their hands dirty”, assisting groups and people in their communities who are facing difficulties.
The associations could recruit volunteers who would be able to help, say, a women’s shelter that has lost its funding because of Conservative cutbacks, or an after-school program that might need to find new facilities.
The party could recruit a lot of those young people who were so emotionally touched by Jack Layton’s remarkable letter when he passed away.
If it wanted to, the NDP even could develop its own version of the Company of Young Canadians, the Trudeau era organization that provided many kinds of support for poor communities.
The party would benefit considerably by getting involved in these kinds of activities. Such a program would allow the party to rebuild and expand its depleted grassroots networks. If the NDP is elected, it will need a wide and responsive base to support it against the right-wing attacks that are almost guaranteed.
And communities would greatly appreciate the support and, most important, there would be a good return at the ballot box. Yes, it could be the right time for the NDP to show some imagination and ingenuity that would allow it to deservedly make its mark in the 2015 election.

RENO -- Because of state budget constraints, the Washoe County School District may have to cut up to $23 million from next year's budget.
Thirty-eight items are slated to be cut, including a 20-percent cut to the Regional Technical Institute, also known as RTI.
The Graphics and Design Program and the Early Childhood Education programs are both slated to be cut. We spoke to a teacher who says she'll lose her job, as well as the parents of preschoolers who take advantage of the low-cost education young children get at RTI.
Parents say RTI is one of the best preschools in Reno.
"They get so much love and security and confidence," says Leslie Hutchens, the mother of a pre-schooler at RTI.
This center likely won't last long. After 16 years of teaching here, early childhood education teacher Marilyn Howard's contract isn't expected to be renewed.
"You think you have some stability," she said. "You think you have some reassurance that you'll have a job and a place if you've been there for 16 years."
Howard says the district is losing a valuable program, one that teaches her high school students life skills, like how to be good parents.
"Everyone thinks it's intuitive that we know how to raise children," Howard says. "It's not something you're born with."
Students say the program has helped them with these skills.
"You learn how to deal with the kids and how not to yell at them all the time," says student Lisa Harpe.
Parents say this class gives young children the skills they need to get a jump-start in kindergarten, and that letting Howard go is a great loss.
"She [Howard] has got 25 years of teaching experience," says Chris Moore, mother of a pre-schooler at RTI. "It's hard to find that and the love and care that she gives to each child."
Howard says she's concerned about the loss of her job, but she's even more concerned about the future of these kids.
"I know I'm doing a good here, not only with the preschoolers but with teenagers," she says. "So that's what's so hard; a great program is going to be lost."
If you'd like to speak out about any of the proposed program cuts in the district, you can do so Thursday night at 7 p.m. at Wooster High School.A clinical report published by the American Academy of Pediatrics on Monday is saying that energy and sports drinks are harmful for children and teens. The report is calling for a total elimination of energy drinks and a near-elimination of high sugar sports drinks.
Many of these drinks, like Red Bull and Monster, are becoming increasingly popular in kids’ diets and can, in fact, cause harm like high blood pressure, high heart rates, and insomnia.
In addition to caffeine, energy drinks include high amounts of sugar and herbal stimulants such as guarana and taurine. Some have up to 500 mg of caffeine, the equivalent of 14 cans of soda. Yikes.
Sports drinks have been around for years, but because of the wide assortments and flavors that are now available, kids are drinking at alarming rates and in lieu of water. The report published in Pediatrics claims the cost of using these drinks interchangeably with water may mean risking obesity, dental erosion, and weight gain. Sports drinks may have a place in kids’ diets, but only if they are participating in activities where they are sweating excessively.
"There's no place for energy drinks for kids," said report co-author Dr. Marcie Beth Schneider, an adolescent physician in Greenwich, Conn. "There's a place for sports drinks, but that place is very specific." manufacturer of Red Bull refuted the AAP’s study saying a can has about as much caffeine as a cup of coffee and includes ingredients that European health officials have declared to be safe. However, users of energy drinks may chug them more quickly than they would hot coffee because they're served cold.
"For most children engaging in routine physical activity, plain water is best," Dr. Holly Benjamin, from the AAP Council on Sports Medicine and Fitness, and co-author of the report, said. The authors advise pediatricians to discuss sports and energy drinks with patients and their parents.
Many people online are reacting to this study with a resounding, "Duh." One blogger sarcastically asked, "What would we do without experts? Red Bull is bad for children." I had to chuckle because I feel the same way. But, I see so many kids emulating their parents, chugging sugary sports drinks throughout the day. Many of my students know not to try to drink energy drinks in my classroom because it will end up in a garbage can and they will have to endure a lecture. But, many of them believe, because of their parents' understanding, that sports drinks are ok. So I guess we do need experts. Some people truly do not know the harm of these drinks.

Thanks for a job well done.Jimmy Savile, Cyril Smith, Stuart Hall and now Max Clifford. Four powerful men, big figures with high public profiles.
And all paedophiles who abused their positions to prey on vulnerable youngsters.
Savile and Smith were, certainly, protected by the establishment.
Political clout intimidated police who protected the villains and failed their victims.
Savile escaped justice by dying before we knew the vile depths of his reign of terror.
Maggie Thatcher’s favourite was considered off limits by the cops.
Rochdale Lib Dem MP Cyril Smith also largely cheated accounting for his offences.
It wasn’t until after his death that Labour MP Simon Danczuk was able to expose Smith’s sadism.
Hall was sheltered by BBC fame but is now deservedly behind bars.
Publicist Clifford will get his just deserts when sentenced on Friday.
Sex abuse victims I’ve spoken to were doubly tormented when nobody listened to them. Their complaints were dismissed, their testimony often rejected.
They were ignored. The result was abusers escaped punishment to continue abusing.
Which brings me to the case of the Tony Blair minister highlighted in yesterday’s Daily Mirror.
The allegation is this minister was involved in a London child sex ring in the 1980s. And a police inquiry was pulled in the 1990s when his name cropped up.
Hand on heart: I don’t know if he is guilty of a heinous crime or if his visits to a children’s home were misunderstood. But I do know there must be a thorough investigation.
Because the allegations are so serious they mustn’t be swept under the carpet.
There must not be another cover-up. We owe the truth to victims of abuse.
If I was the minister under suspicion and innocent, I’d be shouting loudest for an investigation to clear my name.
Over recent years so many people have come forward claiming they were abused by politicians there’s an argument for a wider inquiry.
Crusading MP Tom Watson spoke from a position of knowledge when he demanded an inquiry into a “powerful paedophile ring” linked to the Thatcher regime.
The names of those linked to the Elm Guest House in South West London, a hive of abuse with Cyril Smith among the visitors, will shock you if they ever become public.
Victims who were insulted by cover-ups in the past deserve the truth in the future.
We can’t right past wrongs but we owe it to those who endured unimaginable torment to learn from past mistakes.Goldstar Member’s Event Journal

By BERNADINE MORRIS,
Published: March 26, 1992
PARIS, March 25— Oscar de la Renta, the American who in three seasons has settled comfortably into the French fashion scene, and Yves Saint Laurent, a pillar of the shows here for 30 years, were the last major designers to introduce their fall and winter collections.
It is now clear that women of the world who care about fashion will have a choice of hem lengths. Trousers are back on center stage and black is the color of the season. Clothes are more closely fitted than they have been, but never in a torturous way.
De la Renta opened his show with cheerful checked tweeds in loosely woven wools, combining colors like olive with orange, and wine with gold. In coats, suits and dresses, waistlines were gently fitted, skirts full and flaring.
In his first show here a year ago, de la Renta focused on plaids, which became the hit of the season. Now he hopes to do the same with checks. He even shows similar patterns in sheared mink, which created a buzz in the audience as people realized they were looking at fur, not fabric. They had not seen anything like it since the designer's plaid mink coats.
When he moved into his obligatory black fashion sequence, de la Renta made sure he kept things sexy. A velvet jacket teamed with wool pants had a low curved neckline framed in a satin collar. Plain black suits with short skirts were topped off with big fluffy hats of tulle and feathers.
The grand ball gowns that are a de la Renta specialty -- typically embroidered velvet bodices with billowing satin skirts -- alternated with long slender dresses and gold embroidered pants suits.
Giancarlo Giametti, the business partner of Valentino, one of the first Italian designers to show his ready-to-wear here, welcomed the American to the French fashion community. "Stylish," Giametti told de la Renta. "Very stylish clothes."
Americans are best known in Europe for sports clothes. Though de la Renta did show a lot of sweaters, especially effective with his long flaring checked-wool skirts, his collection is in a more formal mode.
Saint Laurent, over the years, has intoduced a more casual feeling to French design, including pea jackets, pants suits and leather clothes, which are all the rage this season. The biggest burst of applause was elicited by a fire-engine-red cashmere twin sweater set paired with a long, full black velvet skirt. The French don't often see this type of clothing from their high fashion houses.
The collection opened no new fashion territory. The designer did, however, play around with skirt lengths. When hemline unrest began a year ago, Saint Laurent brought his skirts to a sensible level, just clearing the knees. This season, he's all over the lot. In addition to the ankle-length pants he has shown before, he offers thigh-high dresses, coats that are just under ankle length and skirts that stop anywhere from the top to the bottom of the calf.
"It's a beautiful length," said Lucienne Saint Laurent, the designer's mother, pointing to the middle of her calf. "I'm going to try it." The skirt she was wearing was much shorter.
There were some admirable pieces in the collection, including Victorian fitted jackets that looked fine with long skirts or ankle-length pants. But it was clearly not one to change the world.
Looking fit after the show, though his arm was still in a cast from a fall a month ago, Saint Laurent discussed plans to hold his next show in his salon, rather than in the vast tents in the courtyard of the Louvre.
"I myself would prefer a smaller presentation," he said, "but it has not been decided." Then he sighed wistfully. "There is so little time between collections," he said. "One must work so hard."
Among the designers who presented their fall collections before the shows ended this afternoon was Hanae Mori, who was one of the first Japanese to become a regular here. Her show had a little more flash and dash than usual. But the designer thinks her customers, basically conservative women, are ready for her lively patterned knits in both checkerboard effects and the butterfly motif that has become her trademark.
Silk shirts in patchwork designs with quilted jackets and crinkled silk shirts with brocade skirts and pants are other lively ideas. In honor of the shop she plans to open in London this summer, she offered a group of suits in British houndstooth checks and plaids and handled the tailoring with skill. The shop in Piccadilly is one of a number she plans to open in Europe. Barcelona, Spain, is the next target, with a shop scheduled there at the end of the year.
To designers all over the world, Paris is the fashion mecca. If they cannot afford their own space, they form groups to present their clothes in hotels, tents in the Tuileries and even boats anchored in the Seine. The Chamber of Commerce of Austria sponsored a fashion show at the Espace Cardin to introduce the work of six of its designers. They offered knitwear, leathers, tailored clothes and, predictably, variations on loden-cloth jackets.
One of the Austrians, Atil Kutoglu, 25 years old, was ecstatic. "I've shown my clothes in Dusseldorf, Tokyo and New York," he said. "But this is Paris. I'm so excited to be here."
The most original of the Austrian group, he showed clothes with an exotic Turkish theme that played into the ethnic revival in fashion. He mixed plaids with flower prints, wrapped sequined skirts over stretch pants and combined sheer coats with leather shorts.
His clothes had the freshness of talented young designers anywhere in the world. They brought inquiries from store buyers and a few orders. "I'll be back here," he said. "With my own show. Soon."

This drug is also called MDX-1106. It sounds very promising thus far.
For a definition, you can go here:
Definition of Anti-PD-1 Human Monoclonal Antibody MDX-1106
There will also be a webinar on August 17th at 5pm with Mario Sznol, as he presents an expert's presentation on this exciting new therapy. Dr. Sznol is a Professor of Medicine (Medical Oncology) and Co-Director of the Melanoma Program at Yale Cancer Center. He has been involved in pioneering this therapy that is akin to Yervoy and showing promising response rates in trials so far.
You can register at:
Concerning the trials, no, I do not believe you have to be BRAF positive, but for two of the four trials listed you do have to be what is called HLA-A*0201 positive.
Here is a listing of the four trials listed:
The first trial listed is even given with ippi.
You can look at the inclusion/exclusion criteria for each, and also to see if it has a trial location in your area. If you are interested in one of the trials, you should call the contact info for that trial to verify that the information on clinicaltrials.gov is still accurate.
There is also what is called MDX-1105, which is a ANTI-PDL1. It says it is open, but I am not sure this trial is open yet as the drug was supposed to be reformulated. Again, call to verify.

Authorities in Cedar Falls say an SUV hit a school bus loaded with children as it waited near train tracks, but no one was injured.
Cedar Falls police say the accident occurred Wednesday afternoon as the school bus was stopped for railroad tracks on Center Street. The bus was hit from behind.
Children on the school bus, which is owned by the Cedar Falls Community School District, were transferred to another bus.
Authorities say they're continuing to investigate the accident.Here's what you may have missed on Thursday in court and police-related news around the midstate.

The Metropolitan Area Planning Commission voted 6-4 Thursday afternoon against initiating the rezoning of physician George Tiller’s former clinic at 5107 E. Kellogg Drive.
The rezoning had been sought by Kansans for Life, which presented nearly 14,000 signatures in support of the rezoning to the Wichita City Council. The request for the city to initiate the rezoning is believed to be the first of its kind in Wichita, officials have said.
The vote came after presentations from Kansans for Life and from Trust Women, which plans to reopen the clinic under the name South Wind Women’s Center. That group plans to offer health care services to women, including abortions up to 14 weeks. A clinic official has said it will not perform late-term abortions.
David Gittrich, the development director for Kansans for Life, said he was disappointed but not surprised at the vote.
He criticized the decision by city planning officials to proceed with the hearing Thursday afternoon, held after a foot of snow paralyzed the city and closed some city events.
"No question that hurt us significantly," Gittrich said. "There would have been a huge crowd show up if it had been a nice day. Most people thought the city was closed, and it looked to those of us who were there like it was."
The presentations came after 10 MAPC members deadlocked over whether to hear Gittrich’s request. The commission, with three members absent, finally voted 9-1 to hear the request to break the deadlock, said John Schlegel, the city’s planning director.
The deadlock was an early signal the rezoning request would fail, Gittrich said.
"At that point, you knew five people had already made up their minds," he said.
Julie Burkhart, founder of Trust Women, said she was “relieved that they did not vote to take up the public hearing process.”
“We did not request a rezoning of the property,” Burkhart said. “To our knowledge, that property had been used for medical purposes since the 1950s, and (the city’s) staff report said it goes back to 1937."
She said Wichita real estate company J.P. Weigand had marketed the building as a medical office, and she noted the clinic was zoned to allow a medical office when Trust Women bought it in August.
Kansans for Life sought to rezone it as residential, office warehouse or industrial park.
Burkhart said she was thankful that planning commissioners “were able to see that their job" is to ensure buildings are zoned appropriately and to not make decisions based on personal politics.
On Feb. 5, Gittrich presented 13,937 signatures to the City Council and promised hundreds more before the planning commission meeting. He told the council that the clinic isn’t suitable for a residential neighborhood and has been the source of heavy police traffic in the past, arguments he renewed before the planning commission on Thursday.
Gittrich didn’t commit to Kansans for Life’s next move. He did not rule out asking the Wichita City Council to initiate the rezoning itself, or asking neighbors around the clinic to seek the rezoning.
It is the first time that any group has asked for a city-initiated rezoning in Wichita for a specific piece of property, Schlegel said earlier this month. The city and the planning commission have initiated broader rezonings, such as for neighborhoods, but never for an individual property, he said.
Thursday’s vote is the end of deliberations on the request by MAPC, Schlegel said, unless the City Council decides to initiate the rezoning itself.
In that case, planning staff would become involved again and a public hearing would be held, Schlegel said.
City Council members remain noncommittal about the petition and unsure whether any city action would stand up against a court challenge from Trust Women. There are also concerns about the private-property rights questions any city intervention would raise.We're sorry, we need more information to run your search.

About Microgravity
What does it mean to be “weightless”?
We have all seen images, such as the one at the right, of astronauts floating inside a spacecraft. If these astronauts used a spring scale to weigh themselves, they would detect no weight at all. Does no weight mean no gravity?
There certainly is gravity in the space around Earth, and that's what holds satellites in their orbits. Spacecraft with astronauts typically orbit at an altitude of only about 400 km (250 mi), and the acceleration of gravity at this distance is about 90% of its value on the surface of Earth. With all this gravity, how can astronauts be weightless?
The answer is that both the astronauts and the spacecraft are in free fall. Gravity accelerates BOTH equally. It's like being in an elevator with the cable cut. Since you and the elevator accelerate towards the center of Earth equally, you are not pressed down against the floor of the elevator. If you stood on a scale, it would read zero as long as you are falling freely.
The environment inside an orbiting space station is frequently called "microgravity," due to small residual accelerations of the spacecraft, including aerodynamic drag, vehicle rotation, and venting of gases.
This drawing shows how Newton imagined that a cannon could fire a projectile horizontally at various muzzle velocities. If the velocity were high enough, the projectile would follow a circular orbit. In each path shown in the drawing, the cannonball would be in free fall. (drawing courtesy of NASA)
In the SkyLab orbiter, one astronaut balances another on his index finger. (photo courtesy of NASA)
Astronauts-in-training affectionately call this aircraft the "Vomit Comet." To simulate microgravity, the Comet flies a parabolic arc for about 25 seconds, as shown in the inset. A typical training flight consists of flying about 40 such arcs. (photo courtesy of NASA).
Research
Why study fluids in space? For starters, understanding the way fluids behave without gravity may help scientists and engineers to better apply fluid phenomena on Earth- affecting applications like engines, power plants, and heating and cooling systems. Fluids are also integral to life support systems on spacecraft and better understanding of their phenomena is vital to further space exploration. As an example of this, let's examine boiling.
Boiling in microgravity (courtesy of NASA)
Boiling on earth (courtesy of NASA)
Fluids: A fluid is defined as any material that flows in response to an applied force. This means that besides the obvious fluids, water and liquids, air and gases are also fluids. Even the plasma that makes up the sun and stars is a fluid. And, most surprisingly, some solids behave like fluids--both soil and sand easily flow when a force is applied to it.
A pot of boiling water is something most of us can picture in our heads. Think about the role gravity plays in this everyday phenomenon. As the water heats, gravity causes the hotter regions of liquid to rise--a process known as "convection"--which distributes heat throughout the water. Once the water heats to the boiling point, the gravity-induced buoyant force sends the bubbles upwards, producing a "rolling boil." But this familiar picture changes drastically in a microgravity environment. Gravity-driven convection and buoyancy are non-existent, and without their dominating influence, scientists grow closer to understanding the fundamentals of boiling.
Given our dependence on boiling liquids in food and drink preparation, it is easy to imagine why scientists are interested in studying boiling phenomena. But, beyond the kitchen, boiling is used in many engineering systems as an effective means of transferring heat. Excess heat can be dispelled through the vapor bubbles moving through a boiling liquid. Although boiling figures prominently in the mechanics of heating/cooling systems, power plants, and engines, a better understanding of this phenomenon could lead to more efficient and effective applications.
Pool boiling experiments conducted onboard an orbiting space shuttle provided scientists the first glimpse of boiling in space. In gravity, vapor bubbles form on the heater surface of the liquid and, due to buoyancy, quickly rise to the top. In microgravity, without buoyancy, the bubbles remain attached to the heater surface and continue to grow. As these bubbles grow, the liquid is no longer in contact with the heater surface to cool it down and therefore, the liquid is useless as a heat transfer device. This situation can lead to "dryout" which is the suspected cause of the infamous Chernobyl disaster.
The space shuttle boiling experiments and future space station experiments are increasing our knowledge of boiling phenomena. These results will aid in our further exploration of space…. The final frontier.

Instead, this hot gas slowly diffuses away from the wick and burns only when it reaches a supply of oxygen. The flame is spherically symmetric. (photo courtesy of NASA).

Apr 9, 2013, 9:25 PM EDT
Desperate times may call for desperate measures in New Jersey.
The Devils are winless since losing sniper Ilya Kovalchuk to a shoulder injury seven games ago, and have scored just 12 goals.
On Tuesday, the Russian winger returned to practice — and head coach Peter DeBoer suggested there might not be many more practices before he puts Kovalchuk back into the lineup.
“We’re not going to put his safety in jeopardy,” DeBoer told NHL.com. “But we’re not going to wait until he’s 100 percent to get him back. That’s not realistic.”
The Devils haven’t said what’s wrong with Kovalchuk’s shoulder, only offering a timetable for return (2-4 weeks).
Kovalchuk hasn’t said much either, other than he was in a lot of pain and still hasn’t been able to take hard shots.
“You gotta just keep yourself in shape and do what the trainers and the doctors tell you to,” Kovalchuk explained. “We’ve got a great group of guys here who are very professional and I trust them 100 percent.
“I just try to work hard. We all know the situation we are in and I want to be back as soon as possible.”
The Devils have nine games left in their season, including Wednesday night’s Rivalry Game against the Boston Bruins (7:30 p.m. ET, NBCSN).
They currently sit ninth in the East, two back of the eighth-place Islanders for the conference’s final playoff spot.
It stands to reason they won’t be making the postseason without Kovalchuk in the lineup — regardless if he’s at full health or not.
“”I’d take him at less than 100 percent,” DeBoer said. “But he’s got work to do before he’s an option.”

If we’re healthy in the playoffs(assuming we can pull our s*** together and make it) we will be a very dangerous underdog. That healthy team held the penguins to two consecutive one goal games. Also two quick facts as a reminder, last time there was a shortened season and last time we started off 3-0 we won)You have 2 remaining free articles this month

Wang Hui on the dismissal of Bo Xilai.
Stories began to circulate on 6 February, when Wang Lijun, Chongqing’s police chief, fled to the US consulate in the nearby city of Chengdu. Neither the Chinese nor the American authorities have revealed anything about what followed, the US saying only that Wang had an appointment at the consulate and left the next day of his own accord. Since then he has been in the custody of the Chinese government. Reports in the foreign media fuelled online speculation, with the result that all sorts of rumours began to spread – some of them later shown to be true. There were stories about a power struggle between Bo and Wang; about the corruption of Bo’s family (how could they afford to send their son to Harrow, Oxford and Harvard?); about coup attempts by Bo and Zhou Yongkang, the head of China’s security forces; about business deals and spying; about a connection between Bo and the mysterious death of the British businessman Neil Heywood in November. Even supporters of what has been called the Chongqing experiment – the reforms implemented under Bo, who became party secretary there in 2007 – were unwilling to say that no corruption or malfeasance took place. In today’s China, these offer a convenient pretext for an attack on a political enemy.
As the stories multiplied, two main interpretations emerged. The first – supported by a good deal of leaked information – saw the Chongqing case as merely a matter of a local leader who had broken the law. The second linked the incident to political differences. With a population of 32 million, Chongqing is one of the PRC’s four centrally governed municipalities (the others are Beijing, Shanghai and Tianjin). In the 1930s and 1940s, the city was an important arms-manufacturing centre for the Kuomintang, and today serves as a hub for much of south-west China. The Chongqing model operated within China’s existing political institutions and development structures, which emphasise attracting business and investment, but involved quite distinctive social reforms. Large-scale industrial and infrastructural development went hand in hand with an ideology of greater equality – officials were instructed to ‘eat the same, live the same, work the same’ as the people – and an aggressive campaign against organised crime. Open debate and public participation were encouraged, and policies adjusted accordingly. No other large-scale political and economic programme has been carried out so openly since the reform era began in 1978, soon after Mao’s death.
Both interpretations, one denying, the other privileging the political character of the Chongqing events, are partial. The important question is whether the scandal will encourage the development of a politics of democratic participation or merely end up reinforcing China’s practice of ‘backroom politics’. A critical moment came when Premier Wen Jiabao gave a press conference on 14 March at the end of the ‘Two Meetings’ – the National People’s Congress and the Political Consultative Conference – in Beijing. If there were different views about how to handle the Wang Lijun incident, or problems concerning Bo Xilai’s behaviour or that of his family, the Two Meetings would have been the appropriate place to discuss them. This wasn’t what happened.
According to media reports, on the morning of 3 March He Guoqiang, one of the nine members of the Politburo Standing Committee and the secretary of the Central Commission for Discipline Inspection, visited the Chongqing delegation to the Two Meetings and was warmly welcomed by Bo Xilai and Huang Qifan, Chongqing’s mayor. On 8 March, Zhou Yongkang, another member of the Standing Committee and secretary of the Central Political and Legislative Committee, spoke at the Chongqing delegation’s policy deliberation meeting at the National People’s Congress. On 9 March, the Chongqing delegation held a press conference at which Bo Xilai and Huang Qifan took questions for nearly two hours. Yet at the closing press conference on 14 March, the final question (from a Reuters reporter) elicited a prepared response on the situation in Chongqing from Wen.
He began by acknowledging the achievements of ‘successive’ Chongqing governments, but then changed his tone: ‘The current Chongqing and government leadership must reflect on the Wang Lijun incident and learn lessons from it.’ He referred to the 1978 Central Committee plenum that announced the start of the reform policy, and even more pointedly to the CCP’s 1981 ‘Resolution on Certain Questions in the History of Our Party’, which officially declared the Cultural Revolution to have been a ‘disaster for the country and the people’. ‘We have resolved that we should free our minds and seek truth from facts, and we have formulated the basic guidelines for our party,’ he continued.
In particular, we have taken the major decision of reform and opening up in China, a decision that is crucial for China’s future and its destiny. What has happened shows that any practice that we take must be based on the experience and lessons we have learned from history and must serve the people’s interests. The actions that we take must be able to stand the test of history and the reality. I believe that everyone in China understands this, and I have confidence in our future.
It is nearly forty years since the end of the Cultural Revolution and the situation in China today is not remotely comparable to that of the 1970s. So why did Wen want to link Chongqing and the Cultural Revolution? The Chongqing model certainly has its faults, and they have occasioned substantial debate, but the criticisms should have led to improvements. There have been comparable problems in other regions – Guangdong and Wenzhou, for example – but Wen’s rhetorical invocation of the Cultural Revolution served to single out the Chongqing experiment and seal it up, like the Cultural Revolution itself, as a forbidden subject, not available for public debate or historical analysis and fit only for political condemnation. Those associated with it can now be vilified as power-seekers, conspirators, propagandists or reactionaries who want ‘to turn back the wheel of history’.
Around 9 o’clock the next morning, the People’s Daily website hinted on Weibo, the Chinese version of Twitter, that there was about to be ‘an important news announcement’ (the Wang Lijun incident had been made public the same way). At 10.03 a.m., the Xinhua news agency reported on Weibo that Bo had been removed as Chongqing party secretary. Soon afterwards a number of leftist websites began to experience server problems, which lasted for the next five days, and activists were forbidden from mentioning the matter on Weibo. ‘What happened during the two days after 13.45 on 14 March 2012 can be described as a “palace coup”,’ a reporter for the Financial Times’s Chinese website declared. Around midnight on 15 March, Li Yuanchao, head of the Central Committee’s Organisational Department, and Vice Premier Zhang Dejiang arrived in Chongqing and announced Bo’s dismissal.
People who were old enough at the time remembered what the atmosphere was like after the mysterious death of Mao’s nominated successor Lin Biao in 1971. Information is selected or fabricated according to political need, and then released through channels determined by the same considerations. Rumours have flourished inside and outside China, and there are signs of conspiracy everywhere. Rumours are a product of backroom politics, and at the same time provide the means for backroom politics to come out into the open. On 10 April, another rumour went round: the government was going to make an important announcement. The statement came not in the main news bulletin at 7 p.m., but in the 11 o’clock news, when it was announced that Bo’s wife, Gu Kailai, had been arrested on suspicion of murdering Heywood. Bo’s suspension from the Politburo and Central Committee was also announced – allegedly to allow serious violations of party discipline to be investigated. As for Heywood, there are plenty of contradictory accounts there too: the official statement calls him a businessman, but some British reporters have suggested he might have been a spy.
Websites critical of the government, such as Utopia (wuyou zhixiang), were shut down in the days before Gu was arrested to forestall any uncensored comments about her, though the reason given was to remove improper discussions of decisions made by the National People’s Congress. While leftist websites were being closed down, foreign sites, including ‘hostile websites’ like the Falun Gong’s that are usually blocked, were suddenly selectively unblocked, providing a conduit for more rumours to flow into China. The means of transmission itself tells us a lot, involving as it does collaboration between the Chinese and US authorities, as well as interaction between domestic and foreign media. It became difficult to distinguish between the coverage in the New York Times, the Financial Times, the Wall Street Journal and the Falun Gong’s outlet, the Epoch Times, or to differentiate them from Chinese newspapers and websites. The question here is whether there is a single intelligence at work, or a network of forces collaborating to bring about a particular result.
The government doesn’t always seem sure which line to take on the affair. On the one hand, with Wen’s press conference, Bo’s sacking and Gu’s arrest what was first said to be an ‘isolated incident’ has been turned into a situation of the utmost political gravity. Wen’s talk of the Chongqing reforms presaging a repeat of the Cultural Revolution seems intended to indicate that open politics – social experiment and competition between different political positions – will no longer be allowed in China. (The chief similarity with the Cultural Revolution, as many online commentators have pointed out, is the speed with which Bo was removed.)
Having ratcheted up the importance of the incident, the government then tried to downgrade it, releasing information through various channels about Bo and his family breaking the law, in an attempt to cast the matter as a merely criminal case. The Financial Times has claimed the affair shows that ‘the curtain that covers the highest-level secrets of China’s rulers is no longer so tight.’ But the ‘curtain’ has always opened to let through snippets of information at opportune moments. The aim of the current manoeuvres is to clamp down on political freedoms in order to make it easier to drive through deeply unpopular neoliberal measures. In the late 1980s, after some failed attempts to push through ‘price reforms’ on many basic commodities, the death of the former party leader Hu Yaobang – deposed several years before partly because of his leniency over student demonstrations – inspired the discontent that manifested itself in Tiananmen Square and elsewhere. After the students had been repressed the price reforms were pushed through without further protest. It is a pity that during the current celebrations of the 20th anniversary of Deng Xiaoping’s ‘southern tour’ and his call for the speeding up of reforms, nobody is mentioning that the precondition for the accelerating marketisation of 1992 was the crackdown of 1989.
The southern tour opened the way for the privatisation of state-owned enterprises, leading to large-scale lay-offs and systemic corruption. Agricultural reforms caused crisis in rural areas, while the marketisation of social security systems, including medical insurance, led to increasing disparities of provision between rich and poor, country and city. This has led to unrest: in 2008, the state council announced that there were 128,000 ‘collective protest incidents’ in that year. The number has increased since then to 180,000 a year. There has been widespread discussion of the problems of state-owned enterprises, the agrarian crisis and the rising cost of education, housing and medical care, the so-called ‘new three great mountains’. In response to all this a directive to ‘pay more attention to social equality’ replaced the Central Committee’s 1990s policy of ‘giving priority to efficiency, with due consideration of equality’. Yet now that Hu Jintao and Wen – representing a new generation of national leaders – have consolidated their power, political reform has been put on hold and the bureaucratisation of state structures has continued apace.
The emergence of different local models was policy debate of local people, dissatisfied with the position of labour and the gap between rich and poor, rural and urban dwellers. have devoted several pages to the achievements of state-owned enterprises and the argument against privatisation.

An economic breakthrough is unlikely to happen in the near future.
Lukashenka said before yesterday's meeting of the Security Council that he wanted to hear the government's answers to the questions when the economic growth would resume and what we should do to avoid a repeat of the situation that led to problems. Charter97.org asked Leadnid Zaika the head of the analytical centre Strategy, to answer these questions.
– Mr Zaika, when do you think the significant growth will resume? Is it possible with the current economic model?
– If the government is able to notice the peculiarities of the situation, in current conditions, amid crisis, it should lower taxes, give up a lot of expensive programmes and cut budget expenditures. If it does so, it will be easier to achieve the growth. If it continues to raise taxes, what we see now, to support the ineffective employment and sponsor many enterprises, the period of the crisis will take a longer time.
– Can anything really change if the government admits there are serious problems in economy?
– Lukashenka's statements that we need to get rid of some sores in economy were made for population. What does “sores” mean? These are not sores. It is a serious disease. It's not cancer, but it is rather complicated. We need a systematic approach, but they reduced everything to a large-scale modernisation. It is expensive. It is even more expensive than hockey. I think it distorts the situation.
– In you opinion, what should Lukashenka and the government do not to distort the situation, but to improve it?
– The matter is that Lukashenka does not play and does not tend to play the role of the country's main economist. The government behaves like an obedient student who repeats words after his “teacher”. It plans high percents, but it doesn't matter. The GDP growth planned by the government makes no sense. We need quality changes instead of fractions of a percent amid crisis and this tectonic shift. Focusing on percents is a thing of the past. The main thing now is to figure out what growth areas have been created and if we have development prospects for the future. For example, we have prospects for manufacturing 3D printers. The second question is why we produce cars of Toyota Corolla type on the basis of a Chinese clone. Why didn't we begin the production of Tesla electric cars and so on? If we put several questions, we will see that the Belarusian economy has no serious and powerful drivers.To make reservations by phone, dial freephone 0800 221 222 in the UK, 1 800 409 929 in Ireland, or view our regional telephone reservation numbers.

Baton Rouge entrepreneurs looking for a place to work and collaborate have a new option: Springboard Baton Rouge is opening its coworking space downtown on Monday.
The second floor of the Kress Building at 445 Main Street will offer 12,000 square feet of space for members who pay a monthly fee, said James Digby, who co-founded a startup accelerator in Amsterdam and is now running the Springboard space. For the first four weeks, anyone is welcome to come work and check out the location for free.
The goal is to offer local entrepreneurs an affordable place to work, while putting them in a location where they can meet other entrepreneurs, Digby said.
“You could just bump into someone in the space, spark a conversation, and (ultimately) say ‘That’s a great idea, I can use that in what I’m doing,'” Digby said.
In Baton Rouge, Digby said he’s found “there are a heck of a lot of entrepreneurs in a lot of different pockets. They just don’t have a space here.”
Springboard’s memberships will start at $85 per month if people want to come in and use one of the open desks, while a dedicated desk area with storage costs $450 per month. There are a limited number of offices available for $750 per month, Digby said.
Members also get use of the space’s conference rooms, Internet access and other general amenities. In the coming weeks, Springboard plans to announce a lineup of business workshops it will offer, Digby said.
Digby co-founded the Rockstart Accelerator in Amsterdam. He said he first met Wendy Overton, one of the organizers of Startup Weekend Baton Rouge, at the South by Southwest festival in Austin. He was invited to give a talk here, and Springboard co-founder John Schneider asked if he wanted a job.
They kept talking, and Digby decided to go for it.
“I see so much potential in in the region,” Digby said. “That’s not to say I’m here to fulfill that potential. I love to just get people together and allow it to happen naturally. That’s what really excites me.”Click to expand

The Manistique Emeralds varsity softball team welcomed two guests to the Emerald City on Monday for a softball doubleheader: the Escanaba JV Eskymos, and Old Man Winter.
The teams played softball under snowy, windy conditions, with the JV Eskymos getting a big first inning to top Manistique, 13-7. The second game was cancelled.
"It was terrible," Manistique Coach Dave McNeil said. "Big winds, big snowflakes. And I'll tell you what. There's a huge advantage to getting big runs in the first inning when it's 28-degree weather! We played even with them after that, but that first inning was big."On Fri, 2008-07-25 at 11:07 +0200, Nicolas Spalinger wrote: > Dave Crossland wrote: > > 2008/7/24 Vasile Gaburici <vgaburici gmail com>: > >> Does anyone know if they > >> have their own production tools? > > > > They do, and they depend somewhat on proprietary software (FontLab) > > but SIL have been slowly publishing them, I think. > > Yes, the SIL designers and script engineers intend to publish more of > the various tools used in the font production workflow (but it takes > time and effort!).

Now a year later UNL looks back at what happened, the communication break down and how things changed to prevent a similar outbreak.
When asked about regrets UNL Housing Director Sue Gildersleeve says she has none.
"I am very happy with what we have in place right now," said Gildersleeve. "I think we've got a very reasonable protocol and it's serving the students well....Regrets would be old business and I think that we handled everything, it was a difficult situation. I think we worked well with the students to give them as much information and deal with it frankly in a much more proactive fashion."
With her focus on the future, Gildersleeve says the University's bed bug policy is working.
"We have had a couple of incidents in our family housing units. We had two happen last fall. We've taken care of those with heat treatment with no recurrence. Nothing in our residence halls."
But this time last year, students felt at risk.
In response to student and parent concerns, 10/11 News requested hundreds of emails sent among University administrators about the bed bug infestation.
What we found, shows a communication breakdown. It also showed UNL was filtering the information being shared with parents and the media. In emails Gildersleeve reminded RAs that UNL would not allow anyone to talk to the media.
In this email from January 19th, UNL News Director Kelly Bartling insults our effort to share the story with parents and all Nebraskans. "TV, well whatever. I can't stand TV news. Nobody is watching them."
She goes on to write, "Far as I'm concerned, the story is over."
Unfortunately for everyone involved, it was far from over. The infestation continued well into February.
Angry emails from parents and University replies continued through February, as well as the bed bug battle in the dorms.
One RA who lived in a room with bedbugs became concerned when the University didn't tell other students about the problem. She wrote "the major repairs note isn't working." When she asked what to do a housing employee replied, "tell them we're treating the room just to be cautious."
Now, a year later, Gildersleeve is confident with the school's bed bug policy.
UNL will now post signs on dorm floors where inspectors find bedbugs. All infected areas will immediately get heat treated. The school will also focus on communication with students.
"We think that the best course of action is to notify the people closely affected. We count on our students to let parents know if they are affected. But most schools, there is really not a reason to do a large alert," says Gildersleeve.
With only two cases reported on campus this school year, and zero bed bugs showing up in dorms, Gildersleeve stands by UNL's new bedbug protocol.
"I am very satisfied," said Gildersleeve. "We did everything that we could at the time and we've had a good plan moving forward and so far it seems to be working very well."We all want what’s best for our children, and we want to make sure that they are able to get the best possible education. However, the cost of higher education is going up, and it can be difficult to save up to cover those costs.
This is where something like the RESP can help a great deal. You have the chance to take advantage of the power of investing and compound returns with a tax-advantaged account used for the benefit of your child.
What is an RESP, and How Does it Work?
A Registered Education Savings Plan (RESP) allows you to save for a child’s post-secondary education. You place money in the account, and it grows overt time. When your child is ready to attend university, he or she can withdraw the money to help pay for costs.
You can start saving for your child right from birth, you just need to get a Social Insurance Number for your child first as the RESP will be registered to that SIN. You can learn more about how to open the RESP for your child at CanLearn.
One of the great things about the RESP is that a number of people can contribute to the account. Grandparents, friends, and others are allowed to make contributions on behalf of your child. If you are comfortable with this strategy, you can ask friends and family to contribute to the RESP on behalf of your child, rather than giving them toys and gadgets for birthdays and holidays.
RESPs are similar to RRSPs or TFSAs in that they can include various investment products in a government plan to shelter tax and encourage saving. It’s important to note that you don’t receive a tax deduction for your contribution to the RESP, though, as you would with the RRSP contribution. Your RESP is more like a TFSA in this regard: You do not get a tax deduction when you contribute, but there is no tax withheld when you withdraw the money.
How Much Can You Contribute to the RESP?
RESPs have a lifetime contribution limit for each child of $50,000. There is no annual contribution limit, so you can add money in a way that is convenient to you, as long as the lifetime contributions (from all parties adding to the RESP) does not exceed $50,000.
However, even though you don’t need to worry about mandated contributions and limits, it does make sense to use $2,500 as your annual goal due to the Canada Education Savings Grants (CESG).
The CESG is a grant equal to 20% of your contribution, up to $500 each year. The lifetime maximum of the grant is $7,200 per child. Because of this $500 grant limit, you should consider only contributing the $2,500 a year necessary to receive the grant.
What if your child does not complete a post-secondary education? After the age of 21, you can transfer up to $50,000 to your own RRSP. You do have to return the grant money, though.
Looking for a simple, diversified portfolio to use in a Registered Education Savings Plan? I suggest an even split of these four TD e-Series Funds I’ve mentioned previously. As an example, you could contribute $100 every 2 weeks, $25 into each index fund.
With the right plan, you can save up for your child’s education, making his or her university experience more manageable in terms of cost.
Just to point out that it’s actually not the best thing for the RESP account to only contribute $2500 to capture the grant money. The best thing to do is to invest as much as you can as soon as you can to capture the compounding growth if you intend to contribute the maximum of $50k..
Is this also applicable to people who have only been in the US for 2 years?
You can open an RESP for kids that aren’t yours, correct? Like nieces, nephews, grandchildren?
It is really important to understand working of RESP before investing any kind of money into it.
What are the fees in self direct RESPs.La Maison des Trois Thès in Paris is presided over by Madame Yu Hui Tseng, a master of the Chinese tea ceremony and one of the world's preeminent experts on tea (and the only woman among them). She also happens to be a descendant of a famous Chinese philosopher and student of Confucius.
Master Tseng established La Maison des Trois Thès in 1995 in the Fifth arrondissement of Paris. Her shop sells around a thousand varieties of tea, rare vintages among them that date back as far back as 1890. Some black teas, she says, improve with age. She also relies on the 3,000-year history of Chinese tea to create blends that would otherwise no longer be in existence. Next time you're in Paris, consider stopping by for a rare (albeit pricey) cup.

P.S. I had the misfortune of watching Bill O’Reilly while I was at the gym last night. I was a captive audience! Anyway, he was mouthing off about how waterboarding and other torture techniques had kept everybody safe and that only the “loony left” opposed it. Isn’t O’Reilly supposed to be Catholic? Is he aware of Church teaching on torture? Does he know anything about consequentialism? Does he care? Does he realize that this kind of manifest support for a gravely evil act in the public domain could well prohibit him from the Eucharist? Where are the communion warriors when you need them?

- It Is Better That One Man Should Stand In For The People « The American Catholic: Politics and Culture from a Catholic perspective
The Church says that the embrace of its social teaching necessitates a “second conversion” for Catholics, moving from orthodoxy to orthopraxis. The first conversion to orthodox believe has a clear priority, and many remain at this level. The second conversion is to not only to see the truth of Christ, but to see the world through the eyes of Christ. That is the greatest challenge, I think, to one’s “old self.”. I’m still not there..
Yes.
I’m still not there.
I imagine we all must continually engage in a sort of decolonization, that’s for sure.
Not all evangelicals are like this. See Glen Stassen.
I recommend a book to this entire blog. It is called _Where God Happens_ by Rowan Williams. The reading and conversion to the forms of community life in that book would do us–especially me–some good. It would serve as a remedy for the constant and often shallow forms of criticism that appear here too often, like the broad and unhelpful critique of “evangelicals” in recent posts. I know more evangelicals who are closer to the heart of Catholic life and thought than I do Catholics. That may, however, be my peculiar situation in life.
Where are the communion warriors when you need them?
Glued to the tube watching those paragons of Catholicism, Bill Torture O’Reilly and Sean Birthcontrol Hannity.
Brett, yes, you have a point– I like Glen Stassen and Jim Wallis. And Rowan Williams too for that matter.
“Communion warriors” only descend on Democrats. War isn’t intrinsically evil and so forth…and Bush is “pro-life”. Heh!
True-blue (or, as it were, true-red) Evangelicals tend to be terribly annoying, their policies insipid. Their children are more liberal though. Anybody in bed with James Dobson is a creep. This kind of ‘culture war religiosity’, which is mainly directed against things, is what ruined the Republican Party, as far as polite company is concerned. McCain in 2000 would have been another story. Thanks to the ruthless Bush campaign, that didn’t happen.
This is the only country in the West where people seriously believe in creationism, are aghast at the concept of sex ed and so forth. A propensity to support wars is always quite widespread among the ‘saved’ crowd.. I couldn’t even tell you what the whole thing has to do with Christianity. Well, aside from “Are you saved ?”, “Have you accepted Jesus as your savior ?”, with the lovely opinion that they’re good to go. Here’s your sign.
You (Minion) have always accurately described the influence of Evangelicals on American (conservative) Catholics. Heck, down to the music. The “Christian Contemporary” atrocities were frequently heard in Catholic churches.
At least, the “Christian Coalition” and “Moral Majority” (neither moral nor a majority) are pretty much gone. Pat flippin’ Robertson. Not to mention the hyper-emotional “Evangelists” like Benny Hinn or the nuts from the 80s with wives featuring inch-thick-makeup.
While I certainly disagree with a lot of Catholic social policies (the faith aspects don’t really concern me), at least it’s on an educated level.
Minion, I think you should move to Colorado Springs, the Mecca of Evangelicals. For mortification purposes :D The holy rollers make a hairshirt seem fluffy.
Brett, yes, you have a point– I like Glen Stassen and Jim Wallis.
People who put out sloppy and distorted analysis of abortion statistics flock together, I guess.
Mr. Naus, I’ll repeat the question I put to you on November 24, 2008, in the comment thread of the post “the house that Neuhaus built.”
On that post, you seemed to be scoffing at the mental gravitas of the working poor … here do you mean to say that Evangelicals are stupid? The phrase you use, “while I certainly disagree […] at least its on an educated level,” suggests to me that you mean to say this very thing.
Is this the basic framework you work off of? Whoever disagrees with you must be stupid?
“Where are the communion warriors when you need them?”
I’m right here! Just need a bigger soapbox… maybe a clerical collar…
And Gerald, I think it is absolutely ridiculous to use “worship music” as evidence that conservative Catholics are in cahoots with Evangelicals. I realize you aren’t too picky about the brushes you use to tar “conservative Catholics,” but really this one is just nuts. Every “conservative Catholic” I know is utterly aghast at Protestant-style worship music in church. Many of them aren’t happy with anything but the Extraordinary Form!
“Well, actually, the Bible says that evil cannot be negotiated with. It has to just be stopped…. In fact, that is the legitimate role of government. The Bible says that God puts government on earth to punish evildoers. Not good-doers. Evildoers.”
So the Bible doesn’t say we can’t negotiate with evil? I seem to specifically recall Christ three times NOT negotiating with the Devil when He was on the mountain. And what is the legitimate role of government if it’s not to protect its citizens, which sometimes involves punishing those who break the law or threaten its people? In fact, for many that is among the very few legitimate roles of government.
You may find Evangelicals distasteful, but as vulgar as they may seem, they are very often also right.
Interesting, Victor, that you would side with the way certain American evangelicals approach war rather than the just war principles of Catholic social teaching. What are those popes thinking after all, since the bible clearly tells them to take out the evildoers, does it not?
No, yours is the arrogance of private interpretation.
I didn’t say anything about war. I was saying, in general, governments have a duty to protect the weak from the strong and that as Christians was can never negotiate with evil. That’s pretty consistent with Catholic social teaching, eh?. To someone with my yankee roots it seems strange watching a tridentine mass followed by some guy thumping a bible like he just stepped out of a rivival tent. It’s enough to give you whiplash.
…as Christians was can never negotiate with evil. That’s pretty consistent with Catholic social teaching, eh?
Not quite buddy, Unless you mean that we cannot negotiate with evil since evil is abstract. As Christians we cannot simply equate a human being with “evil,” which is what Rick Warren (and you apparently) are doing.
See this whole time I was thinking that evil was a privation of the good and therefore has no real existence. To think that evil can or cannot be negotiated with seems a bit silly to me.
.”
SO true. As a convert, I realize now how much I am having to undo. Even after we converted we were still very Protestant in how we thought about the world and we interpreted it. I think that is to be expected for converts because it is like having to relearn how think and experience and interpret. What is frightening, is that so many Catholic speakers and people in positions of power to sway the Catholic public via books and tv and radio are these converts who are not completely in line with the Church’s thought.

Agreed, and yet they are held up as shining examples of Catholicism at its very best. Some of them seem to specialize in dispensing personal opinion more than anything else. It’s all very strange coming from my background which I admit was rather prejudiced against protestantism having had the faith drilled into me by strict old fashioned nuns back in the pre Vatican II 60’s. They would be rolling in their graves at what goes on today. In the pre-Roe church abortion was never spoken of. Never heard the word. Now it’s all anyone talks about, splitting the laity along political lines, bishop against bishop, people shopping around for new parishes because their pastor doesn’t obsess on Abortion enough to suit them. Those old nuns would have fainted if they even heard that word mentioned out loud. And they had a deep disdain for protestantism. Martin Luther was like the devil incarnate and they always said we could only read a Douay Rheims bible and never King James because that was (horrors) Protestant! I was over at my friend’s one day and he showed me a new bible he got at Sunday School, the cover said “KING JAMES BIBLE”. It was like flashing neon letters at me and I dropped it down on the table like it was poison. It’s funny now but that’s what we learned 40 years ago. Nowdays the pendulum seems to have swung completely in the opposite direction. Very strange times indeed.
Yes the bashing of Evangelcials gets old. THe Parody I often see is not like what I see in real life everyday. It is certaintly not in line with the Church or the leadership of John Paul the II and now Benedict.
I just listened to Anne Rice talk about her books on James Dobson. Now no doubt they disagree with each other on numerous things. But it struck me that if Anne Rice that has a gay son can get on the Dobson show and Dobson thought her story thought they disagree was important and could lead other to Christ then that is a wonderful example of what we all should be doing. No doubt both took some heat for being in each other presence and enjoying each other.
I notice the comment section has gone into another theme about converts and all.
I converted some years ago of course. AmyWellborn is in ROme right now and had a great post on her blog the other day that there is not cookie cutter Catholic and I think maybe that is something we should all remember.It challenges me at time to recall that
It was called “The right kind of Catholic”
After reflecting on what Pope Benedict said on the subject and before saying how in Rome you really confront this
.
MM,
You criticize evangelicals for the same reasons you spit your vitriol all over those who leave comments on this blog, you hate anyone who disagrees with you. Though I agree that evangelicalism is a stain and an aggressive cancer spreading heresy wherever it goes, Evangelicals themselves do not bother me.
I had the misfortune of watching Bill O’Reilly while I was at the gym last night. I was a captive audience!
My friend, that is why God allowed Steve Jobs to invent iPods.
C matt makes a good point. It is providential that the arrival of IPods coincided so closely with the rise of cable news commentary.
That’s it…let’s run all of the evangelical “converts” (how can they be converts when they were already Christians, BTW?) out of the Church because we don’t like their politics! Perfect! The Church isn’t already hurting enough.
JH put it perfectly above:

Oh, I had the ipod, But there was a big close-captioned TV with O’Reilly’s big head. What was I to do? :)
That is a predicament!
On Rick Warren’s comments, I would wonder what the context was. Government’s legitimate role is to protect against the bad guys. How well they carry out that role in a particular instance is a whole other issue. Was Warren simply referring to this general role, or was he stating that the US’s actions vis-a-vis Iraq was a proper implementation of the role? can you do about acne on your own?

So before, you go browsing the web and putting your personal information in any site that looks professional, make sure you follow these simple tips:
Be sure to read the FINE PRINT when the word FREE is involved...
There are 1000's of product offerings on the internet using the term "free". This ussually means that in return for getting that free prize, you need to divulge a lot of personal information about yourself that you would not otherwise share in hopes of getting that free prize. This information that you submit, is often times shared with other companies that pool all these companies data together to offer their data services to 3rd parties. Be cautious when the word "free" is being used, and if you want to protect your personal/private information, don't use it on these type sites before reading their privacy policy or terms and conditions.
Keep your Private Email and Home Phone Number Private!
Signup to one of the free email services out there like: gmail.com, hotmail.com or yahoo.com. So, whenever you are filling out forms on-line you can use this free email account that you dont mind spreading around. Then if the email address is of no use anymore, you can throw it away and open another one. Also, make sure before you ever put your home phone number in any form, you are comfortable with them possibly selling that information to 3rd parties. If you have the extra funds available, purchasing a throwaway phone, might be something you want to consider. This way, you can use the phone # of the throwaway phone whenever filling out forms or offers over the internet.
Use a Post Office Box when necessary
If you are concerned about your private home address being distributed throughout the internet, go ahead and start using a Post Office Box. They are simple to setup, and whenever you want to fill out something over the internet, use the PO Box instead of your private home address.
Useful tools

Signature:"...cross me, and you'll soon discover that under this playful, boyish exterior beats the heart of a ruthless, sadistic maniac."
-Lord Edmund Blackadder IIWind Energy in India has recently seen a sharp dip in investment and gloominess amongst the wind energy companies. Top global wind turbine companies like Gamesa have cut jobs while Vestas is looking to pull out from India altogether. India’s biggest wind market Tamil Nadu which accounts for more than 50% of the total wind power capacity has seen the sharpest decline. This made wind developers become cautious and even seen exits of top executives. However things are going to change soon as India plans to reintroduce Generation based incentives (GBI) which was discontinued. Some states are also revising the tariffs for wind power which had become too low to be remunerative. Andhra Pradhesh which has recently unveiled a 1000 MW solar energy policy is set to increase the wind power tariffs by more than 30% . The new electricity tariff will be Rs 4.70/ Kwh up from Rs 3.50/ Kwh. Note most southern states are suffering from massive power deficits and blackouts.
GBI to be Reintroduced in India
The Indian Wind Industry has been facing problems in 2012 and installations have fallen off sharply as two of the most popular subsidies have been taken away by the Government in March 2012. This coupled with local factors particularly in the biggest market of Tamil Nadu has taken the sheen of the wind energy industry.
However after a huge effort at lobbying , the Government has agreed to reintroduce Generation Based Incentive (GBI) of 80 paise per unit. Note GBI is a kind of feed in tariff given to wind energy production. Instead of a fixed rate, the Government gives 80 paise to the wind farm developers as an incentive. This is over and above what he gets by selling the power to the state electricity board. Accelerated depreciation however is not going to return and seems buried for good.
Wind Energy Industry of India in 2012, finds going tough as Local bodies start to Tax Wind Turbines in Tamil Nadu
The Indian Wind Industry in 2012 is finding the going a bit difficult after a record breaking year in 2011. First the accelerated depreciation subsidy which has been around for a long time making India the 5th largest wind energy producer, has been removed. Second the GBI incentive scheme too was removed so that the Wind Energy industry depends on the Renewable Energy Certificates (REC) scheme which is quite fickle and market based. Now the Wind Energy Industry finds itself facing a new set of problems in its bastion of Tamil Nadu which accounts of almost 1/3rd of the total wind energy capacity in the country. Tangedco, the distribution utility is threatening to remove the “banking facility” of the wind energy producers which allowed them to sell power at a time when the electricity prices were high.
Problems Faced by Indian Wind Industry
Wind Power Plants in India are finding the going tough in 2012. Wind power players are also facing tactical problems like collecting of dues from the state distribution utilities. Most of the state power distribution companies are saddled with massive debt and payment to suppliers is always a perennial problem. In the case of the wind energy developers, the problem of working capital has become acute with payment delays of more than a year..
Google+Google+
In a major boost for wind power energy generation, the Andhra Pradesh Electricity Regulatory Commission has fixed Rs 4.70 per unit tariff for 25 years for firms which sign up power purchase agreements by March 31, 2015. The issue of tariff was proving to be major hurdle for wind power producers. Developers expressed concern that the earlier tariff was unremunerative as it was not bankable. Several leading players in the country had signed up to set up new plants but were unable to do so due to lower tariff structure. Generating companies will have to bear the expenses to evacuate power generated to the grid sub-station.2008 FORD FOCUS SE $8,995

WASHINGTON — Trade representatives from the United States and Colombia recently signed a free trade agreement which will eliminate the South American country’s import tariff on U.S. spirits.
Under the agreement, effective May 15, Colombia’s 15 percent tariff on U.S. produced brandy, gin, liqueurs and certain other spirits will be eliminated. The 15 percent tariff on U.S. whiskey, rum, and vodka will be reduced to 14 percent in 2014, and further reduced by 2 percentage points annually until the duties are completely eliminated..

Elbit Systems' Hermes 900, its largest unmanned air vehicle, made a 15min first flight in strong winds on 9 December in Kziot, southern Israel.
Elbit's Hermes 900 has a 15m (49ft) wingspan, a 970kg (2,130lb) maximum take-off weight and is powered by a 115hp (85kW) Rotax 914 engine for a 300kg payload capability and endurance of 40h.
It has an "independent" automatic take-off and landing capability, allowing the medium altitude-long-endurance UAV to land on non-instrumented runways.
Hermes 900 is also equipped with what Elbit calls "a secured redundant" line-of-sight datalink and a redundant satellite communication beyond-line-of-sight link.
The Hermes 900 is controlled by Elbit's universal ground control station, which the company says can control two UAVs at the same time. Elbit has teamed with Thales and L-3 MAS Canada for the UAV and is offering it to the Canadian army.
On Elbit's website it shows the Hermes 1500, which is larger than the 900, but the company has discontinued that product.
Elbit plans to complete platform testing early next year, says Haim Kellerman, Elbit's co-general manager of unmanned aircraft systems. Platform testing will be followed immediately by a series of payloads tests, which includes Elbit's full range of electro-optical sensors, plus signals intelligence payloads.
Kellerman declined to comment on questions about weaponising the Hermes 900.
The aircraft is scheduled to be available to enter service in the second half of 2010, Kellerman says. So far, Elbit has not announced a launch customer for the aircraft. But Elbit expects the Israeli defence forces to convert its unit operating Hermes 450 to the 900 variant, he says.
"[Customers] want to see the platform," Kellerman says. "Interest will mature now, and that will be turned intoEducating imaginative, resilient leaders for God's changing world.

Korn Dubstep Opinions shown by now our at least a snippet. I wasn't too into Untitled for a second, but I really listened to all the songs and they really are great. I don't think I'll hear a Korn song though and be like that sucks, nah if Korn does something I'm cool with it, I like when bands change their sound constantly. It keeps things fresh.
But MOST IMPORTANTLY we need some more of that badass sounding song! Especially since the release date was pushed back to November. I heard it was coming out in October, and I was like yeah I can get a badass Korn CD for me on my birthday and bump that shit until the neighbors be some dicks calling the cops on me. At 3 in the morning too, probably.
If any of the guys from Korn see this please take the release a flippin song so I don't go insane into consideration.

The gross domestic product of Saxony-Anhalt will increase by 2.6% in 2011. Due to structural reasons the growth is lower than in Germany. In Saxony-Anhalt the key growth driver, the engineering industry, are poorly represented. The previously strong food industry suffers under the pressure of rising commodity prices. The growth gap is explained also from a slowing dynamics in the industry later this year, what is already indicated in the intermediate goods sector, which is the most important part in Saxony-Anhalt´s industry. In addition, the dynamics of household demand for consumer goods and housing is weaker because of the sharp decline in population. Furthermore, the government sector slows in connection with the consolidation of public budgets. The growth gap compared to the average of the New Federal States in total also stems from the fact that the recovery in Saxony-Anhalt had progressed rapidly: 267-275

Frustrated by an increase in petty crime, residents of an Oregon neighborhood have decided to arm themselves instead of calling the police.
Residents of a Jennings Lodge neighborhood in Clackamas county, Ore., have put up fliers advertising their new policy, calling themselves the 'Glock Block', according to KOIN News.
'This is a Glock Block,' the fliers read. 'We don't call 911.'
(Excerpt) Read more at dailymail.co.uk ...
Vigilante neighbors. No bias here, nosiree!
According to the local (KGW Channel 8) newscast last night, it’s just one woman that has put the sign in her window. She gave out signs to her neighbors, but none have displayed them yet. So the headline that it’s the whole neighborhood is totally off.
More neighbor”hoods” need to do this. Make for a lot of “politeness”
To Brits..standing up to the oppressor is vigilantism..cause they were once the oppressors.
“Glock Block.”
Catchy. I like it.
Too bad I’m a Springfield man, though.
Glock Block? Really? Well whatever blows your skirt up.
I’d rather live on a 1911 block or SAA Block. or a browning high power block or a s&w K frame or L frame block, or a Ruger Blackhawk or Redhawk block. Or a sig or beretta block. Even a Walther P 38 or PPK block.
Don’t shoot yourself in the foot with that Glockenspeil.
Glock hater
Ermey is making money. He is in fact a 1911 fan and a Harley fan. But glock and victory motorcycles, brought dump trucks full of money to his house and dumped it in his driveway. GOD BLESS CAPITALISM.
No. Not hate. Bottom of my list.
:o) Me too.
My Dan Wesson Valor is one of my favorites of the five 1911s in my safe.
In my safeI have but one 1943 circa bone stock Remingon Rand. My son keeps a Colt remake of the military 1911a1 that came out around 2001(even has the us property logo on it like my Remington Rand).
It seems Remington, Ruger, Smith and Wesson and everyone else makes a 1911. Amazing how popular a 102 year old antique design is, and how foolproof a design at that.
Then again I find revolvers to often be my go to gun. So many guns, so little time.
I didn’t realize he rode. Outstanding. Maybe I’ll see him on the road someday.
Well, my block is known as the Berretta Block!!!
SouthNarc: That a stock Commander?
Me: Yeah.

Re: How do you set up FaceTime on ipad mini in response to MommaCT
So, first ensure they're signed on their respective ipads in icloud. Go to settings-icloud and verify what account is logged in. Once you've ensured they're logged into their own accounts open up settings-mail calendar and contacts, and ensure none of your accounts are logged on. Now that you've ensured they are logged on and you're not try getting facetime/imessage to work.
Go to settings-message enter their apple ID and log in. Do the same at settings-facetime.
Let me know what problems, if any, you run into.

An attempt to assassinate Premier David Ben Gurion and other members of the Israel Cabinet was foiled today when guards in the Knesset overpowered a young Jew who aimed a loaded Sten gun at the Ministers of the Jewish state after jumping to the Speaker’s platform from the visitors’ gallery.
The Knesset was holding its last session prior to its adjournment for a period extending through the High Holy Days. The would-be assassin, Avraham Tzafati, who is believed to be a religious fanatic, was standing for some time in the visitors’ gallery overlooking the Speaker’s platform. Suddenly he jumped from the gallery to a position before the Knesset chairman’s seat and aimed his lethal weapon at the Israel Ministers who were seated on the platform. He was swiftly seized and overpowered before he could open fire.
Tzafati, who shouted, “Kill Ben Gurion,” as he was taken out of the Knesset building, carried a book of plans for the erection of the Third Temple in Jerusalem. When he was conducted past the Israel Premier, Tzafati screamed: “We fought for you, why don’t you build the Temple?”
The Knesset adjourned shortly after the excitement over the disturbance subsided and an inquiry into the attack was immediately launched. Tzafati is believed to be of unsound mind. He was reported to have claimed after his arrest that he “did not mean to kill anybody” but planned instead to take his own life.
Before adjournment of the session, Herut deputies demanded that the Israel parliament initiate a full-scale debate on the Jerusalem issue in view of the imminent arrival of a United Nations representative for Jerusalem. The demand was opposed by Zalman Aharonovitz, chairman of the Knesset Foreign Affairs Committee, who revealed that his group had already discussed the arrival of the U.N. representative with members of the Foreign Ministry. He pointed out that the last U.N. resolution on Jerusalem empowered the U.N. Conciliation Commission to appoint such a representative which it had now decided to do.
The Jerusalem municipality yesterday adopted unanimously a resolution reiterating opposition to the internationalization of the city. The resolution stated that “in view of the present efforts to reintroduce plans for the internationalization of Jerusalem the municipality once more declares in the name of the inhabitants that it will accept only full Israel sovereignty. Jerusalemites fought and shed their blood for the city when it was abandoned by all the world and they will continue to defend it so that it will remain the capital of Israel.”Get the Best Priced BMW 545i Fuel Level Sending Unit

it's a very uninteresting thing to most of us. some people have great balance and some people have better balance when their heads are above their feet.
not really a lot going on behind that. your balance is different. that's fine. if you want us to tell you you're weird, well, i think you are. most people like to be able to control the front wheel, hence arms on bars.

A short description of the life and works of Chacham Isack Aboab da Fonseca.
Introductory:
Recently it was discovered that the
Portuguese community Kahal Zur Israel most certainly was
the eldest Jewish community on the American continent.
Ishac Aboab da Fonseca, chacham of Kahal Zur Israel,
represents therefore the first “officiating” rabbi in
the New World. This, consequently, sparked a renewed
interest in the personality of chacham Aboab.
So we now know that not all that we read about his life, is correct, for instance the erroneous detail, widely published, that Aboab was the rabbi of the Amsterdam community Beth Israel.
Reason the more to take a plumb into sources of the Municipal Archive of Amsterdam
and sketch his life and work on the basis of recently discovered archival material.
Chacham Aboab died in Amsterdam on Adar II 27th, 5453, being April 4th 1693 at the ripe old age of 88. At his funeral the next day in Ouderkerk, the poet-rabbi Solomon d'Oliveyra spoke at his graveside and commemorated Aboab in poetic words. (1) He started his speech with a metaphor about a broken clock: "the clock does not work anymore, the wheels have fallen out and the cords are broken, everything is mixed up".
I
This confusion is perhaps also the
state of mind of the speaker and his audience and that
is very well imaginable: Isack Aboab had served the
Portuguese community for over 70 years and during this
period he was for many a source of wisdom, a beacon and
a source of strength. The seventeenth century was a
"Golden Age" of prosperity and freedom for the Republic
of the Netherlands, Amsterdam and the Portuguese Jews.
At the same time, however, it was for the Sefardim a
century of uncertainty, distress and conflicts to which
Aboab was witness. To begin with, there was the
uncertainty of the earliest period of settling in
Amsterdam. Then there was the laborious strain around
the 'Uniao", the uniting of the three separate
communities Bet Israel, Bet Jakob and Neve Salom into
one, the Talmud Torah in 1639.
Around 1641 Aboab and his companions left for Recife in Brasil; they survived the rough conditions that prevailed during the Portuguese siege.
In most cases the year of 1642 is mentioned as the year of his departure.
Because of the fact, that his function in the Amsterdam community was taken over by Menasse ben Israel already in May 1641, there is reason to assume that his departure occurred earlier. (2)
After his return to Amsterdam, Aboab was involved in the commotion around Baruch Spinoza in 1656. He was also swept along in the ecstasy around Shabtai Zvi in 1666 and afterwards experienced disenchantment with his ideas. In the end Aboab was the driving force behind the building of the new synagogue.
Aboab has left behind many works, both written as well as translated; he cooperated with writers, poets and printers and portraits have been painted of him. In the notary archives of the city of Amsterdam minutes have been found proving that he participated in the daily life of the city.
After his demise his library has been sold. A description of his collection has been kept.
In short, Aboab has left behind a long trail and his biography echoes the story of the Sefardy Jews in Amsterdam of the seventeenth century.
II
Isaac Aboab was born in 1605 in
Castrodaira, Portugal; his parents were David Aboab and
Isabel da Fonseca. Out of fear of the Inquisition the
family had themselves baptized; Isaac got the name Simao
da Fonseca. Nevertheless, the family was not safe; they
fled the persecution to St. Jean-de-Luz, very near the
border in France and from there to Amsterdam,where they
arrived about 1612. His father became a member of Neve
Salom.
In some texts it is stated that David Aboab died in Saint-Jean de Luz. As no source is given for this information, we assume that the David Aboab, mentioned as a member of Neve Shalom, was the father of I.Aboab. He paid 5 guilders to the community Neve Shalom in the year 1616, this according to the manual of that community that begins in 1616.
According to this source he remained a paying member until 1638.
Isaac Aboab was educated by Chacham Uziel, who was a native of Fez in Barbary. Aboab turned, like his teacher, into a follower of the Cabala.
He is referred to as Ishac Aboafe/Aboab. Only in a later stage did he add his mother’s name Da Fonseca, to his own name .So as to distinguish between him and the other
Aboab’s he is usually mentioned with both names in one.(3)
The first time his name appeared in a source is in the manual of the treasurer of Neve Salom.In the year 5380 (1619/20) he paid for the first time a small annual contribution to the community. The following year, in 5381, he received a salary of about 15 guilders: he taught at the Talmud Torah and he dedicated himself to the Study of the Law. (4) At that time he was not yet seventeen years old.
III
During this period the development of
the Jewish printing industry started in Amsterdam.
Menasse ben Israel (1604-1657) initiated in 1626 the
first Jewish printing house in Amsterdam. He printed
Spanish, Hebrew and Latin books. He was quickly followed
by other Jewish printers/publishers. The arrival around
1640 of the important Venetian printer Emanuel
Benveniste meant that Amsterdam had overtaken Venice as
the center of the world market for Hebrew books. This
came about as a result of the great freedom that Jews
enjoyed there, as well as the economic growth in the
Republic. The Jewish printing industry provided work for
printers, proofreaders, agents and bookbinders – and the
books were sent to all over Europe, as well as to the
Ottoman Empire and Asia. Isaac Aboab earned his living
in the printing industry as well, along with other
activities. The first Hebrew book was printed in
Amsterdam in 1627 by Menasse ben Israel, with Aboab's
assistance who did the proofreading for this prayer
book.
In the historical writings of the period it is almost always mentioned that Isaac Aboab was chacham at Beth Israel in the period before the union in 1639. From the archives it seems, however, that he was engaged by the Neve Salom community. In 1633/34 he received 200 guilders a year as chazzan. The following year, in 5395, chacham Aboab received 300 guilders a year. (5) In 1638, one year before the Uniao, he still received this salary as chacham. (6) Chacham Menasse ben Israel received 150 guilders, the same as 'Ruby' Jacob Gomes.
IV
In 1639, along with the Uniao and the
founding of Talmud Tora, Menasse Ben Israel, David
Pardo, Saul Levi Morteira and Isaac Aboab were appointed
chachamim. Aboab was instructed to teach the Hebrew
language and the first lessons in Gemara. (7) He also
had to provide the 'Derashot de noite'.
He did not serve long at the new Talmud Tora of the community. From the colony Pernambuco in Northern Brazil came the news that Jews could live there in all freedom. The Dutch had conquered this colony in 1624 from the Portuguese. Together with, amongst others, Mozes Raphael de Aguilar, Aboab left around 1641 or 1642 for Brazil. He served in the community Kahal Zur Israel in Recife. It came recently to light that Kahal Zur Israel, probably founded in 1636, was the oldest Jewish community on the American continent, and not the community Mikve Israel in Curacao, as was supposed until now. At the height of its existence in 1645, Kahal Zur Israel had 1,630 members. Aboab was for a long time the rabbi of this prosperous community; as a matter of fact he was the first rabbi serving in the New World.
However, the Portuguese tried to re-conquer the colony from the Dutch. The siege took a long time and the hardship was great. Afterwards Aboab wrote his memories about this time in a Hebrew work "Zecher Asiti Lenifla'oth El": Reminded was I of G'd's Miracles.
The writings of Ishac Aboab, together with the minutes book of the community of Recife (1649-1654) were assembled and published in Hebrew by Joseph David Weitman, rabbi of the community Beth Jacob in Sao Paolo. (8)
Upon his return to Amsterdam in September 1654 he was immediately reinstated in his position of chacham because of seus meritos pasados y presentes – his past and present merits. (9) He earned a salary of 450 guilders and had to hold one sermon per month.
In 1655 he published an important translation. Isaac Aboab, as mentioned, was a cabalist; he was a follower of the Lurian mystical tradition. In his teachings, Isaac Luria (1522-1570) put the emphasis mainly on the deep meaning of daily pious
deeds, which would bring the world nearer to a state of perfection. (10) Luria was a native of Safed (Tsefat), where he headed a group of Cabalists. With their philosophy they made the town of Safed famous.
An important representative of the Lurian thought was Abraham Cohen Herrera (ca.1570-1635), who lived part of his life in Amsterdam. Cohen Herrera wrote in Spanish the cabalist-mystical work Puerta del Cielo –Gate to Heaven. Aboab translated this work into Hebrew, entitled 'Shaar Hashamayim’ thus bringing it to the attention of a larger public. The book was printed in 1655 by Emanuel Benveniste.
After the departure of chacham Menasse ben Israel to England in January 1656, Aboab took over some of his tasks. He now had to hold two sermons per month at a salary of 600 guilders. In his position as chacham he was involved in July 1656 in the pronouncement of the ban of Spinoza. After the death of chacham Saul Levi Morteira in 1660, Aboab became head of the rabbinate.
VI
In 1666 a large part of the Sefardic
community in Europe got carried away by the belief in
the arrival of a Messiah, namely Shabtai Zvi
(1626-1676). In Venice and Hamburg people became
overwhelmed by the prophecies, visions and wonders
connected to the supposed Messiah. Also in Amsterdam the
poor as well as the rich became intoxicated. They tied
green ribbons to their clothes (green was the color of
identifying Shabtai Zvi) and atoned in public for their
sins. In the synagogues musical instruments were now
allowed. Prominent Amsterdam Sefardim made arrangements
to leave for the Holy Land in order to join the Messiah.
Aboab too was in this state of intoxication and believed
strongly in the 'new king'.
The disenchantment was great when Shabtai Zvi was taken prisoner by the sultan in Constantinople and after being put to the choice in September 1666, between death and conversion to the Islam, he chose the latter. The board in Amsterdam ordered all publications and books referring to him to be destroyed. His name was cursed and all traces of him were obliterated.
Belief in tradition and authority were to take the place of shaken expectations (11).
VII
Aboab's wife Ester died in 1669. She
was buried in a new part of the cemetery, which had been
bought in 1663. There was plenty of space in that part.
Up till that year one was buried in order of entry, but
after this expansion of the cemetery there was the
possibility to reserve burial spots in advance. Chacham
Aboab made use of this possibility and had the tomb of
his wife covered with a double stone. On the right side
the following text by Aboab was engraved:
I shall stow away Ester
Until the time comes
That she shall return and
Her soul shall rejoice in happiness.
Because her end came in the night
(Translation by Moshe Mossel, Jerusalem.The original Hebrew text can be found in the book by D. Henriques de Castro Mz-Selected Gravestones from the Dutch Portuguese Jewish Cemetery at Ouderkerk aan de Amstel with Descriptions and Biographical Notes. p. 40 of the Engish version (12))
Above the text is a wreath of leaves with the text ' a virtuous woman is the jewel of her husband '. Underneath the text on the tombstone a reclining hour-glass is engraved.
Aboab remarried with Sara, whom he also survived. David Henriques de Castro discovered in the nineteenth century a small blue tombstone very near the double tombstone. According to this stone she passed away in 1690. (13)
VIII
In 1670 when it turned out that the
synagogue at the Houtgracht became too small, Aboab took
the initiative to argue for the building of a new
synagogue instead of enlarging the existing one. On
November 23rd, 1670 he held an enthusiasm-inspiring
sermon after which the amount of approximately 40,000
guilders was offered. His exertions were rewarded and it
was decided to buy a piece of land near the synagogue at
the Houtgracht. The construction suffered delays because
of the war against England and a heavy storm. However,
on Friday, August 2nd, 1675 the building was inaugurated
in the presence of Mayors, Aldermen and other notables.
The imposing building was lit up with candles. Three
encircling were made carrying Tora Scrolls and Chacham
Aboab carried the first Tora Scroll. The songs that were
sung during the three rounds were composed by Aboab
himself and Solomon d'Oliveyra.
The name of Aboab is intertwined ingeniously in the Hebrew words above the entrance to the synagogue. The text reads as follows: 'But I shall enter Your House
through your greatness and mercifulness'. (Psalm 5:8).
According to tradition a date/year can be made up from the letters/numbers of an aphorism. These words are then often indicated by little stars or other signs. In this case the last word is 'bet-cha': meaning Your House, the letters beth-yud-tav-kav having the value of 2+10+400+20. These total up to (5)432 = 1671/1672.
It is not clear whether this year refers to the real start of the building activities or to the date that the building actually should have been completed.
The name of Aboab is spread over two words, one after the other. The fifth word Avu=aleph-beth-wav-aleph and the first letter of the last word, the already mentioned beth-cha. In this way his name, spelled aleph(a)-beth(b)-wav (like o)-aleph-beth is cleverly intertwined in the text.
The building still is impressive. The Czech writer Egon Kisch wrote: It is in no way a house of assembly for outcasts, the house neither withered nor tending to hide, a beautiful building, a Jewish cathedral. (14)
Isaac Aboab was and is still being honored for his contribution to the realization of the house of prayer. "Honor to his memory for this meritorious work! For this a laurel was put on his grave!" wrote David Henrigues de Castro (15).
IX
The period of about 1670 till about
1685 was a turbulent one in the history of the Talmud
Torah. There were constant conflicts about money between
the management and the members of the community (family
Del Sotto), about the prohibition to buy poultry from
the Ashkenazi Jews (Abarbanel), about choices of marital
partners (families Curiel and Aboab), about the place
persons were assigned in the new synagogue (Isack
Henriques Coutinho), or about the text of the hashkava
at the grave of a deceased (families Pereira and de
Mercado).
The conflicts had one similarity: rebellion against the authority of the parnassim. (16) These quarrels always came down to the same: the families who were in opposition wanted to establish their own community and home synagogue. Obviously the parnassim strongly opposed and were supported by the Amsterdam municipal authorities. The aldermen passed a ruling in 1680 at the request of a Portuguese Jew who was not permitted to establish a home synagogue: that as long as he wanted to be Jewish he would have to keep to the regulations of the church.
Aboab fulfilled an important role in all these conflicts. It appears from the events that the members of the community mostly did not listen at all to the parnassim, but in the end they recognized the authority of the chachamim. In all these conflicts Aboab stood steadfast behind the parnassim and tried to restore the peace. He was successful: in the end the rebellious families returned to the Talmud Torah.
One of the quarrels was about the text of the hashkava used for David de Mercado who died in 1682. A group of family members and friends, amongst whom Jacob Israel Pereira and his sons did not agree with the leadership nor with the Chief Rabbis. The documents have been kept in the notary's archives; we can follow this conflict almost by the day.
Chacham Aboab also handed a declaration to the notary. He told in Dutch what he had experienced at the cemetery in Ouderkerk and in the synagogue. In the cemetery a quarrel broke out about the text of the hashkava. The family and friends of David de Mercado wanted to perform the hashkava as it was phrased originally: haham asalem. Aboab translated this for the notary as 'a wise and perfect preacher'. But because the leadership and the rabbis were of the opinion that David de Mercado had been a member of the community just like all the others, they refused to honor him this
way. A row broke out and many hard words were said. Because chacham Aboab and chacham Sasportas(who would succeed Aboab after his death) could not calm the people's mood they both left Ouderkerk in haste in a boat. A few days later the quarrel was continued in the synagogue. There was a great row and the parnassim did not succeed to restore order. At last the chachamim raised their voices to tell them to be quiet and so they calmed down.
X
Isaac Aboab was absorbed in his
studies until his death.
When he was about 75 years old he wrote a commentary to the Pentateuch: Paraphrasis comentada sobre el Pentateucho. The book was published by Jacob de Cordova in 1681.
During the last years of his life Aboab was blind. Even though the light in his eyes was darkened, he saw the Light better through study and contemplation, said Solomon d'Oliveira in a speech at his grave. (17)
Aboab was laid to rest next to his first wife Ester. The double tombstone now got the text on the left side: 'Tombstone of the very wise and excellent rabbi (…) spiritual head and leader of theological studies at the Holy Community in Amsterdam, who was called to the divine fields of heaven on Saturday, 27 Adar II of the year 5453 (April 4th, 1693). For 70 years he was head of this community and reached the age of 88 years (…). (18) Above the text are engraved a pomegranate branch and an olive branch hanging from a crown, beneath the text lies an hourglass and between both sides stands a column with an open book and a little crown as well as on one page a burning candle. Beneath this is a text from Yesaya:- 'and your virtue is your vanguard', and out of a cloud appears an arm of which the hand holds a crowned F. The F refers to Fonseca. A two-armed lamp is placed above both slabs with the text (19).
As previously mentioned, his collection of books was put up for sale. From the catalogue printed in 1693 by David Tartas, we know that had owned more than 400 books, most of which were in the Hebrew language. In this collection there obviously were not only a great number of cabala works, but also philosophical works from Jewish authors like Maimonides and non-Jewish ones like Aristotle.
His name lived on, also in a literary sense. After his death his name and the date of his death were printed on each side of the Sephardic Ketuba, the marriage settlement. These forms were still in use after tens of years.

Trooper Jack Walker says the accidents likely happened around 3:15 a.m., and the call to OHP came in around 3:40 a.m.
The wreck happened when a pickup truck, believed to be a Dodge model, was traveling northbound in the southbound lanes of the highway.
The pickup collided head-on with a semi, then rolled over and caught fire, killing the lone driver.
Two brothers, identified as Jeffrey and Timothy Sheffield of Florida, were taken to McAlester Regional Medical Center to be treated for minor injuries. They have since been released.
Investigators are still working to figure out who was driving this pickup truck, as the body was not immediately identifiable.
"The Highway Patrol and medical examiners are working hard to make identification of the body and hopefully we'll get that as quickly as we can and we'll be able to make notification to the family," Walker said.
Investigators are also looking into just what caused the driver to travel the wrong-way on the highway.
Hazmat crews were called to the scene, because the semi truck leaked a small amount of diesel onto the highway.
The accident did not create a traffic backup, but did close down the left southbound lane of Highway 69 for roughly 3 hours.
The road has since reopened.The Buffalo and Erie County Public Library's 2010 Adult Summer Reading Contest exceeded all expectations!

"I wanted a place where people could hand themselves over to the very best beauty experts in the world," he says.
He's not lying: you can get your spray tan done by the charming James Read, your mani by beauty editor's fave Adam Slee. Follicular trouble? Trichologist Ricardo Vila Nova, a man with possibly the healthiest-looking hair in the world, is on hand to fix it. There are bespoke face and body treatments by Natura Bissé (Kathy Phillips, doyenne of beauty journalism and the brains behind ThisWorks, waxes lyrical about them when I bump into her on the stairs, so I take note), and you can have a 'life-changing' 'intimate wax' by the no-nonsense Kim Lawless. And so on.
I'm there for a simple buff and a chat with UK nail queen Marian Newman, who heads up her eponymous nail lounge at the Atelier, but she has a rather exciting treatment to try out on me, and it's brand-spanking new to the UK (and currently exclusive to the Atelier). For the first time ever, she says, she can repair weak, brittle, and even severely damaged nails. "It's a total game-changer," she says.
The IBX System uses heat and UV light to help penetrate a blend of jojoba and avocado oil plus toughening agents deep into the nail, where it forms an 'interpenetrating polymer network' that fuses the nails' top layers together with little flexible polymer links.
The result? Hydration is locked in. Nails are strengthened. Peeling stops, splitting stops. White spots disappear.
"Think of keratin treatments for your hair, where strength and smoothness is locked in for months," says Marian. "This is the same principle."
"Gel nails are everywhere right now, and inasmuch as they are safe if you apply and remove the gels properly, there is still always a payoff, as the regular acetone soakings inevitable dry nail out," says Marian. "IBX will form a protective shield against this."
"But it will also repair severely splitting, peeling, and ridged nails, and turn yellow nails pinkish again, in a few treatments. Healthy nails like yours will simply get stronger, pinker and more resistant to drying out and peeling, allowing them to grow longer and stronger."
Hallelujah, I was just decrying my nails' recent lack of strength and unwelcome new tendency to split and break. Marian paints on some solution, lets it dry, paints on some more, shoves my hands under her UV lamps (one for every hand – very flash) a second time. And that's it. It takes about 45 minutes.
Three days on, my nails are gleaming. They look glossy straight out of the shower: water doesn't seem to penetrate and soften them. They've returned to their pink and-white hues of yore, and there's no splitting or breaking. And that's all in a single treatment. If you want fabulous nails, I'd start forming an orderly queue at the Atelier right about now.

KATY PERRY'S NEW COVERGIRL AD CAMPAIGN
WEDDING MAKEUP FOR HUMIDITYMartyn Brown of Team 17 said he appreciates "PS3 owners getting pissed off" Alien Breed Evolution isn't there day one, but that's "up to Sony" to address.
Xbox Live sales and marketing clout "far outweighs" launching on both as a standalone publisher. Not the case of "here's some cash in a suitcase." Talk of bribery ," studio boss Brown tells VideoGamer.com.
"Obviously we'd like everything on every platform day one. The LIVE Arcade thing… we get accused of being bribed or we've took Microsoft's money, and it's all bollocks."
," he added, it's just the way the world goes.
."
Has a platform exclusive really stung you, videogamer?According to a study done at the Department of Family and Preventive Medicine at University of California at San Diego, a lifetime equivalent of two cups of coffee per day is associated with decreased bone density at both the hip and the spine in older women if they don't also drink milk (JAMA, 1994; 27: 280-3). (Moderate daily milk consumption, about one glass of milk per day, seems to counterbalance somewhat the calcium wasting effect of caffeine.)
Nightshades
The concept that the nightshade vegetables affect calcium balance has been put forth for over 20 years by Dr Norman Childers, a professor of botany at the University of Florida at Gainesville and formerly of horticulture at Rutgers University. The nightshades comprise a family named Solanaceae, which includes potato, tomato, aubergine, red, green, chili and other hot peppers, paprika, and tobacco. Professor Childers has shown that nightshade consumption contributes to osteoarthritis because these plants contain substances called alkaloids, which disturb the calcium metabolism and tend to remove calcium from the bones, causing aches, pains, even deformations.
It has been my speculation since the early 1980s that people eat so many nightshades simply to counterbalance their consumption of milk products, which have more calcium than human beings need. Theoretically, then, dairy products and nightshades are opposite and complementary: if you eat one, you need the other. Conversely, if you stop eating one (say, dairy), you might do well abandoning the other, or else there may be repercussions in the body's calcium balance. Many of my students and acquaintances have found that if they keep eating nightshades in a low fat, dairy free diet, their joints begin to ache.
I haven't found any studies that directly link osteoporosis and nightshades. Nevertheless, it may be sensible to pay attention to them because of their ability to affect calcium balance. For those at risk for osteoporosis, an occasional potato or tomato may not cause any trouble; however, it may be a good idea to refrain from relying heavily on these vegetables in the diet. In all cases in which I enquired, women with osteoporosis and a history of bone fractures relied on heavy daily use of potatoes as a major source of starch, and tomatoes as both a flavouring and a raw vegetable.

After a fantastic November, the wheels have slightly come off the Cobblers’ bandwagon with three defeats on the spin, two in the league and one in the Johnstone’s Paint Trophy, but Nicholls believes the rot can be stopped on the English Riviera.
Despite successive league defeats at the hands of Oxford United and Cheltenham Town, the Cobblers are still just four points adrift of the play-off places and Nicholls is still very positive.
“If we had got points from the last two games then we would have been in the play-offs,” said the shot-stopper, who is on a season-long loan from Premier League side Wigan Athletic.
“But luck hasn’t been on our side and we have to just keep going.
“If we want to be in the play-offs at the end of the season then we have to be beating teams like Torquay.”
The Cobblers squad travelled to the south west today ahead of the game, and Nicholls says he and his team-mates are still in confident mood despite their blip in form.
“I think we have to approach every game the same,” said the 20-year-old.
“In our last two games we had chances to win, and we could have won both games.
“So I think we will go into the Torquay match and prepare in the same way, and we will go to win the game as we do every other.”
Conceding goals has become an issue again for the Cobblers, with Nicholls having to pick the ball out of his net eight times in the past three matches.
Prior to those three games, the Cobblers had conceded just five in six fixtures, and some supporters are concerned the arrival of Clarke Carlisle has upset the balance in the Town defence
But Nicholls insists that is not the case, and that the former York City man just needs some time to settle in at Sixfields again.
“When I first heard about Clarke Carlisle signing, I thought it would be a great signing and could be one of the signings of the season,” said Nicholls.
“As soon as he settles in and as soon as the back four get used to each other and gel as a team, then we could be a side that can go on runs.
“I don’t think there have been many problems, and it is now just a case of getting a solid back four.
“We just need to get used to each other.”
THE Cobblers have been handed a home tie in the fourth round of the FA Youth Cup against either Hull City or Swansea City.
The tie is a reward for their 2-1 third-round win over Canvey Island at Sixfields on Wednesday night.
The clash with the Tigers or Swans has to be played before January 19, 2013.
FORMER Cobblers defender Ian Hendon has been promoted to Under-21s coach at Premier League outfit West Ham United.
Hendon, who has previously managed Barnet, was in charge of the development squad at Upton Park, but has been promoted in a reshuffle following manager Sam Allardyce’s decision to remove Wally Downes from his coaching team.

Teams of three students from all over the southwest region of Ohio challenge themselves to write their best fiction and nonfiction for a panel of judges, and gather at Miami University Middletown's Campus Community Center in December for a series of writing-related activities. Faculty advisors attend with their students and engage in aninformative seminar and other conferencing events. Highlights of the program include:
Each team of three students (grades 9-12 eligible) will complete two different writing tasks and receive an overall performance rating from the Program Judgesâ€”members of the Miami University Department of English. Writing teamsâ€™ work will be exchanged with a partner team from a different school. All participating teams will meet for a half-day conference in which students will meet with their partner teams to discuss their writing, receive feedback from a faculty mentor, engage in a creative writing workshop. Faculty advisors can attend a seminar on teaching and writing, and all participants will enjoy a lunch banquet, during which selected students will read from their work. All participating teams will also receive certificates of participation and copies of Student Voices, a publication of highlights from the teamsâ€™ writing submissions.
The teams will not be competing against one another, but rather will be "competing" against themselves in an effort to produce their very best work. Faculty should choose three students with a sincere interest in writing.
A fuller description of the writing tasks will be sent to you when you register, but a brief overview of the writing submission requirements follows:
Each team member will submit a piece of prose. Students may choose a favorite piece they have already written or they may write a new piece specifically for the Program. Any kind of prose is acceptable: for example, an informative essay, a short story, a persuasive paper, a narrative, a newspaper editorial, an analysis of literature, film, television, or advertising. No entry may be longer than six typed, double-spaced pages. Poetry will not be accepted.
In addition, teams will submit one collaboratively written work of prose. All three team members will collaborate on an assigned topic. The topic will be sent to each team as soon as it has registered for the program. The submitted writing will be holistically rated by our judges, and each team's overall performance will receive a rating of Superior, Outstanding, Good, or Place.

The mention of the Elaine Irwin paintings helped to tie the art back to the Leg Up video and the Whenever album which represent a coupling of John's work as a painter with his music career - which is really my take on his art and this show. It also helped me get around to talking about that great little Hud painting. I wasn't attempting to catalog his relationships in an art review. Hope that clears this up a bit!
Anybody know what the second meg painting looks like?. Love the first one in the coat with her staring straight out.
Anon/sandy, I sure saw you mention meg ryan in your comment though.....
i only see elaine mentioned in this article. i think maybe that may be what anonymous may be talking about. i dont see anything else mentioning meg in this article.
There are two paintings of his girlfriend Meg Ryan there. The ones of Elaine and one of his other ex-wives are older works. and why not? They were/are all part of his life.
i am so glad john included his painting of elaine. and no mention of meg lmao

I guess one of the main advantages, or disadvantages, of America is that it's mythology and foundation can be remembered. In another couple hundred years, it will all be legend held together by convenient artifacts.
this is a great idea. its important to support your local artists, not just walk around art openings looking for free wine.
Some investors buy high end works sight unseen from major auction houses, they phone in bids based on who the artist is.

I think this is brilliant. It's a way to generate arts awareness, support artists on a small (but important) scale, and encourage artistic productivity. Well done Seed Space. Well done Nashville.
Hey all, one of the CSArt curators here -- We at believe in supporting artists financially. Much of what is time/labor intensive for an artist's work is the energy put into making one's idea elegant-once you've got that down, producing the work isn't as labor intensive (think photography -- that reproducible great shot), therefore so expensive to produce. The CSArtists sell their work for $1000-$4000 a pop in galleries and many of them show internationally, making a CSArt crate a GREAT deal, even if you only like 1 piece in a crate!
The artists we asked to participate all eagerly agreed to make a limited edition run of a work for many reasons, some of which are so that more people would know and own their work. Many of them went above and beyond and are making 50 originals, which we love (but didn't require)!
As artists, writers and curators, we want to get more real (not poster art so often bought in stores) art to more people by making it both accessible and affordable. Like Laura H said, if $250 is too much, split it with 4 friends and make it fun!
One thing to keep in mind that art has the potential to appreciate in value. If you own a unique collage by, for example, Mike Calway-Fagen and he ends up having a solo show at the Guggenheim in 15 years---there's a good chance that art work you own by him will be worth more as well. Considering the past (see Robert Rauschenberg, see Cindy Sherman, see Red Grooms). Consider what happens beyond the immediate results. It could be more rewarding even beyond Just supporting your local art community.

The class action, led by Slater & Gordon, alleges
Senior GPT executive and former operations chief
The Federal Court in Melbourne heard how GPT executives struggled with their partner’s more conservative forecast as the joint venture’s earnings were revised down.
Peter Collinson, SC, for the litigants, questioned whether the $70 million downgrade proposed by Babcock & Brown “blew a hole" in GPT’s growth forecast as a result.
“It was a just a lower number," Mr O’Brien replied. “I wouldn’t describe it as blowing a hole in the forecast."
The joint venture’s earnings were slashed from $211 million to $143 million, although GPT had pushed for a $177 million forecast, the court heard.
Mr Collinson asked how GPT had arrived at the $177 million estimate and questioned whether it was merely a “balancing item" that allowed the trust to achieve its 5 per cent growth forecast.
“What you’re suggesting is we invented that number when that clearly is not the case," Mr O’Brien replied. He said his team were “sceptical" of their partner’s $143 million forecast, because it may have been lowered to allow the joint venture to achieve its growth forecast the following year, thus averting a requirement to wind the vehicle up.
But there was pressure on GPT, too, the court heard, because lower earnings from the joint venture would lead to an earnings downgrade, which could put pressure on its share price and prompt a takeover bid from a rival.
“It would be both a tragedy and travesty if we were on the receiving end of a successful bid," former GPT chairman
The litigants’ lawyers also grilled Mr O’Brien at length over how GPT executives had derived their earnings forecast for their European funds management business, Halverton.
Another line of inquiry fixed on GPT’s expectations of investor support for a $960 million capital raising for its wholesale fund. A successful raising would have allowed GPT to retrieve some investment from the fund, and bring development profit to book.

MILTON, Ga. – The city of Milton recently won the “Outstanding Plan Implementation” award for its work on the Crabapple Form Based Code and Transfer of Development Rights Ordinance.
The honor was given at the Georgia Planning Association Chapter Awards in late September.
“This is a huge win for the city and a great way to recognize the time our residents, plan partners and staff spent working on the cutting-edge ordinance now in place,” said Community Development Director Kathleen Field.
After six months of stakeholder meetings and two months of administrative work, the ordinance was adopted June 18 by Milton City Council. The vote capped more than two years of work to create the vision and framework for an ideal Crabapple.
The new zoning tools mean Milton can now create a uniform, community-approved aesthetic in the area while protecting the surrounding open spaces from development.
Milton is the only jurisdiction in Georgia to embed the transfer of development rights into a Form Based Code ordinance. Since the successful adoption, the planning team has been asked to speak at the Atlanta Regional Commission, Georgia State University and the Congress for New Urbanism, Atlanta chapter.
So far, the response has been favorable because of the ordinance’s transferability for use by other jurisdictions. The city has already begun work on a similar ordinance for the Ga. 9/Deerfield Parkway corridor, with stakeholder meetings kicking off in September. The ordinance is expected to be drafted in March, after which a presentation will be made to council for possible adoption..Vienna, VA (PRWEB) September 24, 2012

Visits to the Osteopath revealed inflamed kneecaps, unsurprisingly, excessively tight muscles and a significant imbalance between my quads and my VMOs. Treatments prescribed by the Osteopath were initially quite helpful but ultimately Yoga and Pilates classes gave me back the flexibility I had been used to, the ability to move freely again and a better understanding of the muscle network connecting throughout our bodies. It turns out a knee problem could ultimately link to poor pelvic posture or even a weakness in the abs.
So what had happened? Why, all of a sudden, did my knees start playing up? Well, to be perfectly honest I am still not entirely sure. It’s a bit of a mystery, but I can only guess that a sudden change in exercise caused my muscles to react very extreme. The weird thing is that I was always reluctant to call it an injury. As far as I was concerned I had not injured myself…but something had definitely gone wrong.
Things unfolded last year in the spring of 2011 when I injured my shoulder. Initially after the injury I could barely pick up a glass, so needless to say that any jerking movements were out of the question, and that included running.
Since I began running in 2006, at the time mainly to get fit, the sport has become an increasingly important part of my life. Getting out for a run after a day at the office helps clear my head and get perspective on things. For me it has never been about running a marathon or a specific distance, but about pushing my own limits and getting healthy, while having that time to myself. By 2011 I couldn’t imagine my life without running, I was training regularly trying to add a little distance, shave off a little time and I had taken part in a couple of 5km and 10km charity runs.
But, what does a shoulder injury have to do with running or a misaligned patellar, I hear you asking? And how did it turn a Yoga and Pilates snob into a ‘believer’? I had tried Yoga once before, a decade ago, and have to admit that the class had entertained me for all the wrong reasons. I became a giggling wreck!
Just to clarify, I am well aware (now) that Yoga and Pilates are not the same, even if they cover some similar exercises, but the focus of the exercises varies from class to class. Furthermore, since there are several types of Yoga, in this article I will be referring to Hatha Yoga.
But I digress. When I injured my shoulder I worried about getting out of shape. Over the previous year I had been training a lot with plenty of hill – running, plus the first 10km race under my belt. I was probably at my fittest to date and I did not intend to lose that. So, how to keep fit? Well if I couldn’t run I could still walk, and tucking my arm in tightly I even managed to keep my shoulder still. And I went walking, as fast as I could, almost every day after work for several kilometres. However, since I was ‘only’ walking, not running, I became increasingly lazy when it came to stretching and it is probably worth mentioning that I had been an avid stretcher. I have always been reasonably flexible and found that I could improve the ‘bendiness’ by stretching properly after an exercise session.
Within three weeks my right kneecap had started ‘clicking’ or ‘popping’ now and then. A long weekend in the Yorkshire dales made it even worse and the following week I decided to get some advice from an Osteopath, as the standard quad stretches did not seem to work. After some extensive assessment and a rather painful massage of my quad, VMO, ITB and calf, I was sent home with exercises to do daily, the suggestion to self-massage my leg (Have you ever tried that? It’s hard work) and a new appointment for the next week.
By then I had over compensated on my left leg to such an extent that it had started to come out in sympathy!
I was at a point now where everything had become so tight and my kneecaps inflamed, that I could barely bent my knees, let alone cycle, walk properly or even get down the stairs as usual. Everything that would require my thigh muscles to tense up was almost impossible, as it pushed my kneecaps too tightly onto my thighbones. It was surprisingly painful.
Over the next couple of months I regularly saw the Osteopath and followed the prescribed exercise and massage instructions diligently. While things were improving slowly, by mid-summer stairs were still an issue, as was walking for any more than 10 minutes, and running as well as squatting or kneeling were entirely out of the question. I had gained some of my mobility back and was able to cycle again, but the clicking kneecaps continued, so did the visits to the Osteopath, and I had to stretch after every bike-ride or walk, as my muscles would tense up quickly if I did not.
At the time I had already signed up to a rowing course for that July, but the rate my recovery was going at, it was very unlikely I would be able to take part…how was I going to get into a tiny slim rowing boat if I couldn’t squat or kneel and was only able to sit on the floor by ‘dropping’ the last few inches? I decided to cancel.
I hadn’t run in about 4 months by this point and personally this was taking quite a toll. While the lack of exercise depleted me of my usual energy it also made me impatient, easily annoyed, frustrated and generally discontent. It had been such a long time that I was finding it hard to imagine myself out running again anytime soon.
Having scoured the internet for information, I had not found anything particularly useful. There is a lot online about patellar mal-tracking, covering everything from symptoms and anatomical descriptions to stretching and surgery, but no explanation on what may have brought it on so suddenly or what to do about it other than stretch.
August approached and there was a Hatha Yoga course starting in my building at work…Thinking of the stereotype, ‘people who do Yoga tend to be quite flexible’, I decided to go and see if I could take part.
The course was approximately 8 weeks and a complete eye opener!
When it started I had been seeing the Osteopath and following his advice for three months, and I continued to do so throughout the course, but the improvements I saw from week to week with the Yoga exercises was inspiring.
It was slow, included relaxation and allowed me to do the exercises to my own ability which improved from week to week. When the course finished in October, I was able to walk normally, but still needed to stretch, and had started practising on the cross-trainer and rowing machine at the gym. I still couldn’t quite squat or kneel, though my attempts were improving, and all my stretching sessions included Yoga postures now.
A basic movement sequence like the ‘Sun Salutation’ which incorporates muscle groups throughout the body, helped improve my flexibility with every try. At the same time the exercises slowly started building up my leg muscles again, which had lost significant strength in the previous months.
And not least of all, the classes provided a feeling of reasonable contentment for the first time in months. Being used to ‘aerobic’ sports, I am still surprised by the impact an ‘anaerobic’ session can have and its ability to make you feel calm and relaxed, yet still exercised.
My next experiment was a Pilates course, hoping it would offer a similar balance to Yoga between movement, stretching and relaxation. It turned out to be a little more active with exercises centred on core strengthening, posture awareness and flexibility. However, the exercises are still individually adaptable to one’s own ability, usually being split into several levels, such as the “preparation”, a “mid-level” or a “full version”. Attendees are free to decide which version they feel most comfortable with, and the interesting thing is that changes within one’s ability from week to week, serve as a really good indication on ‘problem’ areas, such as stiff backs, tight muscle groups or similar.
Another 8 weeks after starting the Pilates course and coming up to Christmas 2011 I went to my last appointment at the Osteopath. In the meantime I had started to do short bouts on the gym’s treadmill, continued on the cross-trainer and rowing machine and included a 30mins session mixing Yoga, Pilates and general stretching at the end. Somewhere around this time I also finally managed a squat!
In January of this year I went on my first outdoor run! I am now back to running about three times a week, I have returned to a Legs, Bums, Tums class at the gym and guess what, I signed up for that rowing course again this summer.
I am still doing the Pilates classes and I have no intention to stop! I enjoy noticing how my flexibility improves from week to week. Additionally I have gained an increased awareness of my posture and how to improve it, which has also transcended into my running. I am much more aware of hunched shoulders, running ‘tall’ as well as my footfall and leg extension now. My muscles still get tight, and at times my knees still get a little aggravated, but I am now in a position to deal with it and relish mostly pain-free runs.
And you know what else, a couple of weeks ago I managed to do my first ever splits!
It was uncomfortable and tough, and I haven’t managed it fully again since, but I am sure I will again soon.
The moral of the story… well I guess there are several. For me there are three things I have learned from this.
One; I am one very lucky girl. Having gotten only a very short glimpse into a world where I am not free to move as I please, I am even more grateful for my health and ability to do anything I want.
Two; don’t take injury lightly, or any other condition. Now more than ever do I believe the mantra “Listen to your body”. Take a break, get the necessary rest and get things sorted before resuming training, thus hopefully preventing anything more serious.
Three; if it comes to health vs. fitness, health should always win out. Granted a two-week or even month-long break, may set you back a bit, cause you to lose a little tone and gain a little flab, but a forced break lasting 6 months or more, will not only set you back a couple of minutes or miles but return you to naught.
Oh, and last but not least, keep supple…and do not discount the benefits of Yoga and Pilates, they provide an effective low-impact balance to the rhythmical pounding of your trainers on the track.Robert Young

That was a couple of days before he went missing March 26.
In the three months since his disappearance, little information has surfaced; however, family, friends and investigators are still asking the community for answers.
Efforts to generate information and awareness include flooding Oroville with banners and four billboards. However, on Wednesday, two of the banners placed at a property Neal King owns near the intersection of Olive Highway and Oro-Quincy Highway were removed. The banners, which were donated, were there Wednesday morning, but were gone in the evening, Gayle King said during a phone interview Wednesday evening.
One appears to have been returned, but the banner that faces the majority of traffic is still missing, she said Thursday. She said it's very disrespectful that someone would do that.
The banner, which is approximately 6-by-2-feet, shows a picture and gives a description of Neal King, and announces a $20,000 reward that is being offered by his family.
A friend driving toward Berry Creek noticed the missing banners and alerted King, she said from her home in McLean, Texas. The locks placed on the property were also cut off.
Gayle King had the property, which was reportedly leased to Donald and Jennifer Cheatham, secured in April because the building was left unattended for months, King said.
Law enforcement officials kicked the door in when they searched for Neal and everything was out in the open, King said. It was locked to protect the property that was there. If things went missing, she didn't want to be held responsible, she added.
King informed the authorities of the issue and that witnesses reportedly saw Jennifer Cheatham on the property removing items that belong to Cheatham and her husband's company — Amazon Garden Supply, King said.
Cheatham was sent an eviction notice in early June, King said. However, King would have appreciated a notice to let her know when the property would be vacated, she added.
The recent theft of the banners just adds to the frustration King was already feeling, she said. She's in disbelief that someone would take the banners.
"I get frustrated at every turn," King said.
However, it's the lack of information to her son's disappearance that leaves her baffled.
In a town with about 15,000 people, how can someone disappear and no one notice? King asked. It's a small town and people notice things, she added.
She hopes Oroville residents will stand up and not allow a crime like this to go unpunished, King said of her son's case.
Chico resident Neal King, 24, was reported missing by his girlfriend March 29, three days after he allegedly attended a business meeting to finalize a deal to exchange property for marijuana at the home of Donald Cheatham on the 4000 block of Hildale Avenue in Oroville.
According to the Butte County Sheriff's Office, King is thought to have been last seen in the Berry Creek area, about 20 miles northeast of Oroville.
After several search warrants, Donald Cheatham, 36, and Jennifer Cheatham, 38, were arrested and face charges with possessing marijuana for sale and a firearms enhancement. Their trial is set for Aug. 19.
On April 10, the BCSO reported that it thought foul play was involved in King's disappearance.
Neal probably walked into something and had no idea what was going on, Gayle King said. His demeanor before he went missing didn't indicate that he was worried about anything.
"I don't think he was expecting not to come home that night," she said.
Since his disappearance, Gayle King lives "in that place of not knowing where he could be," she said.
Authorities are also having a difficult time pinpointing a location.
The BCSO has looked into all the properties that are known of, have served several search warrants and used cadaver dogs on a couple of properties, but have had negative results, BCSO Detective Jay Freeman previously told this newspaper.
"At this point, we're still not sure where he is or what happened to him," he said.
There has been no cooperation from the primary suspect — Don Cheatham, Freeman said. He's about the only person who appears to know anything.
Gayle King wants people who may have information to come forward, she said.
"My kids lost a brother and I've lost a son," she said. "He was a good kid and he didn't deserve this ..."
A Facebook page titled "Missing: NEAL KING" was created for people to leave tips or contact information.
Anyone with information is urged to contact detective Freeman at 538-3828.

Lazar Krstic said Saturday he believed economic changes in Serbia should be implemented fully without delay, but that Prime Minister Aleksandar Vucic "is soft-hearted, and that is why he has the support of the people."
Krstic adds the austerity measures should include losing 160,000 jobs in the public sector in the next two years, and pension and salary cuts of up to 20 percent.
Serbia must overhaul the economy to draw much needed foreign investment and advance the EU membership bid. The government Saturday passed new pension and labor laws amid workers' protests, but has been reluctant to cut jobs and salaries.South Jersey News - Page 10

Time factor in e-learning: impact literature review
Resum
Some exploratory research.
With the aim of looking at how the topic of time in e-learning is addressed in relevant research a tentative study is being conducted based on a literature review.
This research is now in a second phase and includes a wider specialized journals, data base gathering and also some readjustments on the technological resources area analysis. Below are the results from phase one. Accepted as an important issue in e-learning, this phase has been crucial into pursuing the new stage that has to lead to a broader knowledge about not only the importance of the time factor in e-learning but the real role it has in research in e-learning.I have already spoken in my earlier posts about the vital need for us to recognise that Christian’s should expect to be able to change. Some types of counselling seems to focus on trying to find explanations for why we are the way we are. This is only ever useful if it is the first step to enabling us to change.
The bible is full of commands that we are expected to fullfill. It is no use us simply saying ‘but I cant do that’. God never commands us to do that which is impossible. Whilst we will have a lifetime’s struggle, we should expect it to be an ever more victorious one (even if there are setbacks along the way)
It is my belief that one of the areas we should focus on most as christians is our thought life. It is vital to distinguish between thoughts and feelings here. People often say something like “I feel inadequate” or “I feel inferior”. This is wrong of course as these are not emotions but cognitions. We must learn to question our thoughts and the rational basis for them. Ironically of course sometimes these are accurate assesmments- you feel like a failure because you ARE one! It is no use pretending you are not- but fortunately you are not the only failure- we all are!
God is in the business of changing failures into successes. One of the ways that needs to happen is in our thought life. Also, we sometimes need to just start behaving in the ways we would if the problem was solved. So, if struggling to forgive a close family member, taking a step to bless them by buying a small present might be hard to do, and we might be feeling like a hypocrite as we do it, but the act of doing the right thing will begin to change our thoughts and feelings.
As Jay Adams puts it (Christian Counsellors manual, p 118) one of the devils most cunning tricks is to pursuade men that “they cannot do what God requres because they do not feel like doing it. or that they must do what they feel like doing and cannot help themselves”
We live in an age that fosters our desires and turns them into “felt needs” and then proceeds to try and sell the satisfaction of those needs to us. The gospel teaches us to die to our desires and live for others.
Perhaps the best example of this is the biblical command to love one another- or particulalry ones wife. The biblical response to someone saying they have fallen out of love with their spouse is to teach them how to act in such a way as to rekindle that love.
Our counselling should focus on our responsiblity to make wise choices and act in according to Gods ways. A detailed self-examination for hidden sin, followed by confession and repentance goes a long way to solving many problems. Repentance and change are the hallmarks of the maturing Christian.
God really has given us what we need for this process to occurr..

Evangelical:Pope asks forgiveness for ‘evil’ of clerical child abuse
Francis feels compelled ‘to personally ask for forgiveness’ over damage to children

Pope Francis has today made his first public plea for forgiveness for the “evil” committed by priests who molested children, using some of his strongest words yet on the Church’s sexual abuse crisis.
The Argentine-born pontiff said the Catholic,” the pope said.
Victims’ groups have criticised Pope Francis in recent months for not taking a bold enough stand on the issue and for not meeting with sexual abuse victims in Italy and in a July trip to Brazil.
In December, the Vatican announced the creation of a new, dedicated group to help the church fight the abuse crisis, but only named its members in late March.
The group of clerics and lay people includes Marie Collins, the Irish survivor of abuse in the 1960s who has campaigned for the protection of children and for justice for abused children.
ReutersHell Hole
Part comedy, part tragedy and all bite, No Man's Land damns and mocks in equal measure, painting a picture of war's absurdity that should make peaceniks of us all but, likely, won't. Although set in the former Yugoslavia during the Bosnian-Serbian war, the movie transcends its geographic borders: Bosnian-born writer-director Danis Tanovic could just as easily have been talking about the Middle East, Northern Ireland, Rwanda, Afghanistan or any of a dozen other regions torn apart by long-standing ethnic and religious hatreds.
The tone is established early on when a small group of Bosnian soldiers get lost in a fog. Huddled together, waiting for the air to clear, they talk. "What is the difference between an optimist and a pessimist?" asks Ciki (Branko Djuric). "A pessimist thinks things can't get worse; an optimist knows they can." Very soon, of course, things do get worse: When the fog clears, a firefight breaks out between the Bosnians and a nearby unit of Serbs. Ciki survives by rolling into an open-air trench, a long, thin gash in the earth that lies halfway between the Bosnian and Serb military lines -- no man's land. Before long he is joined by Nino (Rene Bitorajac), a frightened, rather clumsy Serbian soldier who has been ordered to check out the foxhole.
Despite clearly being stuck in the same boat, the two men can't stop hurling epithets at each other or trying to gain the upper hand. Any momentary shift in power proves a hollow victory, of course, since neither man can raise his head above the trench without getting shot at by both their Serb and Bosnian brethren. Making survival even less likely is a third body in the trench, that of Cera (Filip Sovagovic), a Bosnian soldier lying on top of a bomb rigged to explode if he moves.
Marchand (Georges Siatidis), a French sergeant with the U.N. peace-keeping force UNPROFOR, learns of the men's plight and tries to help, despite orders from his superiors not to get involved. When a British journalist, Jane Livingstone (Katrin Cartlidge), hears of the rescue attempt, she and a phalanx of other reporters race to the site, turning the event into a media circus.
Practically no one emerges unscathed in Tanovic's cleverly conceived and written script, which was named best screenplay at last May's Cannes Film Festival. Antiwar, rather than anti-Serb, it is a blistering attack on the U.N.'s utter ineffectualness; on the bloodthirsty, ratings-obsessed media; and on the warring factions themselves, whose similarities far outweigh their differences. Using satire as his building blocks and irony as his mortar, Tanovic exposes a level of insanity and absurdity that has become sadly commonplace in today's world.
The ironies zing by. The U.N. high command in the region, Colonel Soft (Simon Callow), claims he can't act without orders from his superiors, a time-honored don't-blame-me defense that allows everyone in the chain of command an excuse for inaction (the colonel seems far more concerned with seducing his secretary than attending to the conflict anyway). Falling back on a policy of neutrality, the U.N. basically sits back and watches as the combatants slaughter one another. If the film has a hero, it is Marchand, who is sick of being a bystander and rightly observes that "doing nothing to stop it is taking sides." But even his efforts are brimming with irony since he has to expend as much time and effort in preventing Ciki and Nino from killing each other as he does in trying to rescue the three men from the foxhole. Perhaps the film's most delicious irony is reserved for the end and concerns the ambitious and self-absorbed Livingstone.
Most of No Man's Land takes place in a 10-by-15-foot hole in the ground, yet the film feels neither stagy nor static, and it never becomes boring. In fact, it is consistently amusing, filled with small, "inside" jokes, such as the German bomb expert who arrives punctually at 3:30, the exact time he is expected. The film reverberates with anger and intelligence, wit and despair. Hope is harder to distinguish, yet the very fact that Tanovic can still find humor is itself a hopeful sign. He rejects the label "black comedy" for his work, describing it, instead, as "a very serious film with a sense of humor." It is an apt description for a very remarkable film, one of the best of the season.

Ministerial decision
Robyn Bromley, Delegate of the Minister for the Environment and Heritage, 29 January 2007
The Hon Tim Mulherin MP
Minister for Primary Industries and Fisheries
GPO Box 46
Brisbane QLD 4001
Dear Minister
I am writing to you as Delegate of the Minister for the Environment and Heritage in relation to the assessment of the Queensland (QLD) Spanner Crab Fishery under the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999 (EPBC Act). An assessment of the QLD Spanner Crab Fishery under the EPBC Act was completed in 2002. As a result of that assessment, the former Minister for the Environment and Heritage, the Hon David Kemp MP, declared the QLD Spanner Crab Fishery exempt from the export provisions of the EPBC Act and included product from the fishery on the List of Exempt Native Specimens (LENS) until 5 February 2007. He also accredited the Fisheries (Spanner Crab) Management Plan 1999 (the Spanner Crab Management Plan) under the relevant protected species provisions of Part 13 of the EPBC Act.
In December 2006 the QLD Department of Primary Industries and Fisheries (DPI&F) submitted the 2005 and 2006 Annual Status Reports for the Spanner Crab Fishery for consideration of further export approval of product from the fishery. The DPI&F reports have been assessed for the purposes of the wildlife trade provisions of Part 13A and the protected species provisions of Part 13 of the EPBC Act. The assessment also took account of measures that have been developed by DPI&F in response to recommendations made in the initial assessment of the QLD Spanner Crab Fishery to improve the management of the fishery.
I am pleased to advise that assessment of the fishery is now complete. The assessment report will be available on the Department of the Environment and Heritage website at:.
While I consider that the existing Part 13 accreditation still applies to the QLD Spanner Crab Fishery, in the initial assessment only the Spanner Crab Management Plan was accredited under Part 13. I understand that recently three operators were granted General Fisheries Permits (GFPs) which allow them to operate in a manner contrary to the Management Plan (by using larger boats and double the amount of dillies). While I do not consider that this practice is likely to pose a significant threat to protected species given the existing extremely low rate of interaction and DPI&F’s implementation of a protected species education program and reporting mechanism, operations under these permits are not currently exempt from the offence provisions of Part 13. I therefore believe it is appropriate to accredit the management regime for the fishery, including the Spanner Crab Management Plan and the Fisheries Regulation 1995 (under which the GFPs are issued), under Part 13 of the EPBC Act. The new accreditation will ensure that individual fishers operating in accordance with the management arrangements, including GFPs, LENS, to include specimens that are, or are derived from, fish taken in the QLD Spanner Crab under the Convention on the International Trade in Endangered Species.
The management arrangements for the fishery meet the Australian Government’s Guidelines for the Ecologically Sustainable Management of Fisheries. The QLD Spanner Crab Fishery January 2007
Attachment A
Recommendations to Queensland Fisheries Service on the ecologically sustainable management of the Queensland Spanner Crab Fishery
The QLD Spanner Crab Fishery is a well-managed fishery with a range of management measures to promote the ecologically sustainable harvesting of species from the fishery. These measures include:
- protection of berried female crabs;
- a Total Allowable Catch (TAC) and Individual Transferable Quota’s (ITQs) in the fishery;
- a minimum size limit;
- a seasonal closure; and
- gear restrictions.
The following recommendations have been made to further strengthen the effectiveness of the management arrangements for the fishery and minimise environmental risks in the medium to longer term. DPI&F should action these recommendations before the next review in 2012.
Recommendations
- DPI&F to inform DEH of any intended amendments to the management arrangements that may affect sustainability of the target species or negatively impact on byproduct, bycatch, protected species or the ecosystem.
- DPI&F to ensure that management arrangements for the shared spanner crab stock with NSW take account of the results of the collaborative monitoring project, once available.
- By the end of 2007 DPI&F to develop a compliance strategy for the Spanner Crab Fishery addressing high risks identified in the compliance risk assessment, particularly those relating to data reliability.
- By the end of 2008, DPI&F to develop an improved method of estimating abundance of the spanner crab stock that takes into account relevant information on the biological characteristics of spanner crabs, changing fisher behaviour and increased effort in the fishery.
- DPI&F to undertake an assessment of the impact of operations under GFPs that takes into account the impact of the operations on the target species and broader ecosystem and cumulative impacts of the permits issued, and incorporate this as part of the next review of the Spanner Crab Management Plan.
- By mid 2008, DPI&F to implement management responses for risks ranked as ‘moderate’ or above in the Spanner Crab Ecological Risk Assessment.Categories

Bootcamp Starts in July at the Chicago School of Poetics
We got a reminder in our inbox today to get prepared to enroll in summer sessions at the Chicago School of Poetics, which start on July 19th. They offer a melange of online courses from Remix the Poem to Strategizing Poetics to Dream Journaling and Poetry. But they’re also getting militant with their poetics. Check out first Poetry Bootcamp:
In this writing intensive course students will craft original poems using concepts and techniques like surrealist operations, investigative poetics, Japanese poetic diary practice, mining secondary source texts, found language, use of paratextual elements like footnotes, marginalia, and indexing, list poems, etymological research, homophonic and homolinguistic translation, ekphrastic poetry, bestiaries, abecedarians, autobiography, and so forth. Students will generate a copious amount of writing from which to work, edit, revise, and exhaust all resources in the writing of poetry.
And once you’ve passed that one, you can move on to, of course, Publishing Bootcamp:
Now that you’ve written hundreds of poems you’d like to see them in print or online. The instructor will share his insight gained after 12+ years of editing a respected online magazine, and publishing his own poetry in numerous magazines and in book form. Are contests really worth it? Should you have to help a publisher pay for print costs? What are some of the leading poetry publications and how should you follow up with them? Students will receive sound instructor advice and critique on specific methods for publishing.
You’ll be playing Reveille!

A war hero who was missed off a south Norfolk memorial will have his name added after a historian urged the parish council to take action.
Albert ‘Ray’ Childs will join his brother Harry and 16 others on the Hethersett War Memorial after Bea Ewart, village historian and joint author of a book on the memorial, raised her concerns.
Councillors agreed that it was an appropriate time to make the change, with the memorial set to be cleaned and enhanced later in the year.
Mrs Ewart said that the absence was likely to have been an accident.
“He could have been put on but it looks as if they didn’t know about him. Either that or the family were so cut up about their youngest son dying that they didn’t want to do anything or tell anyone,” she said.
Mr Childs was gassed during active service in France 1918. Although he continued to serve in the war, he returned home to be hospitalised when his health deteriorated to “a precarious state”.
He died aged 24 in 1919 and was buried in St Remigius Churchyard.
The village stalwart - whose family name was honoured at the naming of Childs Road - was known to many as the secretary of the juvenile branch of the Rechabites Club and secretary of Hethersett Cricket Club.
The addition will mark the second occasion that a name has been to the war memorial - Norman Folkard was included in 2011 after he was killed in action in 1956 during the Cyprus Emergency.
Hethersett Parish Council is also supporting a new website, set up by councillor Peter Steward, which looks at the village and the men who served in both war.

Our response? A new workshop and some new research that Forrester clients will see very soon.
[Update - Jun 4 - The research is out now Top 10 Web Design Fixes For Improving Business Results]
We looked at our existing, rigorous review method and we asked ourselves - "Which of these criteria do we see most often across all the sites we review? And which flaws are pretty simple to find and fix? And, finally, which of these criteria deliver the biggest impact on business results?" We narrowed things down to ten test criteria for which we have very robust ROI cases, backed up by plenty of examples .
Harley Manning is going to publish a document soon which will explain our rationale for this new methodology and provide examples of good and bad designs to make things crystal clear. We're also running two workshops in June - one in London and one in Cambridge (MA) - to train clients in the "top ten" methodology and do some interactive exercises so that participants will actually review their own sites.
Top Ten Web Design Fixes Workshop London - 17, June, 2009 (led by Jonathan Browne) -
Top Ten Web Design Fixes Workshop Cambridge (MA) - 18, June, 2009 (led by Megan Burns) -
I'm hosting the London workshop, and I'm pretty excited to be the first Forrester analyst to introduce this method to our clients. Please take a look at the event page on our Web site - and please mention this workshop to friends and colleagues who would benefit from learning how to find and fix the ten problems that most sites have, that are easy to spot and worth it to fix. This workshop will be great for them - and I predict that the people who pursue this kind of tactical, low-cost, high-impact agenda during this recession will be indispensable to their companies.

It's a big day for the South Florida courts today, what with the conviction of superpimp Arthur Vanmoor and sentencing of dirty-bomber, Jose Padilla, to 17 years.
Vanmoor, who was profiled by New Times in 2004, once owned 90 percent of the escort businesses listed in the Fort Lauderdale phone book. He also sold fake cancer cures. Van Moor is going down for 19 counts. Sentencing is still a ways off.
Padilla, also profiled by New Times, is going to the can for conspiring to support Islamic extremists. Perhaps the most interesting thing about his case is that much of the evidence against him couldn't be used in court because the Bush administration doesn't respect Constitutional Rights

After an 11th-hour elimination round sent the beastly CT home, the game has blown wide open on the guys’ side. Johnny Bananas is a tried and true champ but admitted on last night’s episode that “Free Agents” — which has found him in multiple elimination rounds — has left him exhausted.
Johnny Reilly, on the other hand, has never been on the chopping block. With luck on his side, he seems rested and ready to take on what host TJ Lavin deemed the most difficult thing the final six competitors would ever have to do in their lives.
Zach, meanwhile, may be built like a brick house and has won multiple missions on “Free Agents,” but he got off to a rough start in the final’s first leg with Devyn as his canoe’s co-pilot.
Speaking of Devyn, the master politician has earned her way to a second consecutive finale. And though she has admitted she’s not an obvious physical threat, she’s been victorious every time the game has gotten intellectual.
Laurel, who’s got brains and brawn (remember — she just sent Theresa packing in a puzzle-oriented elimination round), is an undisputed warrior. But she’ll be the first to tell you that in three finals, she’s never managed to ascend past second place.
Lastly, Nany, who’s begun her very first final on a high note, has been on a tear lately. She snatched first place in the game’s last two missions, but she admitted to Bananas that she isn’t sure she’s got what it takes to go the distance.
So, all things considered, which two competitors do you think will walk away winners at the end of the twenty-fifth “Challenge” season?

2014 Chevrolet Malibu
The Malibu is a roomier, more refined and more efficient execution midsize sedan for 2014. Updated styling, a revised interior, a new 2.5L standard engine and suspension enhancements highlight the changes. It's rated at 196 hp and 186 lb ft of torque. Revised transmission shift points and quicker shifts also enhance the feeling of performance.
Chassis and suspension updates contribute to the 2014 Malibu's more refined driving experience to enable more precise calibration of the dampers for a smoother overall ride, while also improving body roll control and weight transfer during acceleration or turning.

© Motor Matters, 2013Happy out there with ya!
If any of ya find any leprechauns running around out there that look like this one …. snatch on to her for me (you guys know I have a “thing” for thigh highs and midgets…LOL)
All kidding aside, I hope you are all having a fun and safe night out. That said, if you are out painting the town green, DON’T drink and drive. Please remember to use a designated driver or call a cab .
Even though I’m stuck here, we really haven’t had too bad of a day. The weather was absolutely BEAUTIFUL and it’s beginning to feel a little like spring.
They’ve been paining our station for the past week or so and the oil base paint has added a new aroma to our house. We’ve had all the doors open and fans set in every direction but we are still faced with the not so pleasant fragrance. Lucky for us, the Chief came to visit.
He decided there was no way he was gonna allow us to cook or eat in these conditions so he invited us up to Station #5 for our evening meal.
Turns out, the Chief was pulling double duty today … chief and chef.
Chief Adkins (Theodore Wendel …. TEDDY) and I worked together for many years on Ladder 2 when I was first hired. Teddy was the Senior Private and I the Junior when Ladder 2 was a tiller (open tiller). We went through a lot doors together and he taught me several lessons along the way. Working back then was FUN … we didn’t want a day off because we were afraid we’d miss something.
Teddy taught me about “seniority” in the fire house. As a kid and rookie fireman, obviously; I wanted the tiller position. Teddy would always remind me how I needed to learn “this” position or “that” task before trying to jump right to the tiller. That was unless it was raining, snowing or just plain cold as hell …. then it was time for me to learn the tiller …LMAO.
Teddy was also one of the men who taught me how to cook in a firehouse. It’s NOT EASY. The station was a double company with the Battalion stationed there as well. There were 10 men to cook for each day. You had to plan the menu, shop and cook and meals had better hit the table at noon and 18:00.
One of Teddy’s special dishes is the St. Patty’s Day staple … corned beef and cabbage.
It’s a casserole type dish that is very good. Corned beef, cabbage, potatoes and carrots. Anyway, that’s what he so fittingly prepared tonight.
Thanks to Chief Adkins and the Brothers and Sisters at Station #5 for having us down.
We weren’t the only guest at the Station #5 table tonight. The ambo had a paramedic student riding and the Chief had Priest ride along. The student is Jewish so it was mentioned that I should include a joke in tonight’s post…. 12 Firemen, a Jew and a Priest were sitting at …errrr… LOL … I’d better not.
The Chief’s ride along was Reverend Sandy Webb of St. John’s Episcopal Church. The Reverend is helping to start a Chaplin Program in our Department and wants to get out to meet our members and see a little of what we do and face.
We have attempted Chaplin programs in the past but none have lasted. Our Brothers out in the County have a great one in place and I hope Father Webb can create something similar.
Everyone was on their best behavior and the Father seemed to enjoy not only the meal but the typical firehouse table chatter.
I’m not sure he fully understands what he’s getting into but I know that he has some pretty good help by his side so I’m certain he’ll do just fine. (sorry about the first picture and the “midget and thigh high” comment Father but I did ask you to keep an open mind when checking out the site…lol) Special THANKS to Reverend Webb for his efforts on our behalf.
It’s a bit odd I guess but St. Patty’s Day always has me thinking of New York and the FDNY. I used to go up every year and march along side the Brothers from 39/16. I made the trip one last time following the 9-11 attacks and was honored to march ahead of 343 American flags.
With the FDNY on my mind and a Priest in the house, my thoughts were of Father Mychal Judge.
Father Judge was the Chaplin for the FDNY and was known and loved by all its members. He was a Roman Catholic priest of the Franciscan Order of Friars Minor
You’d never know it by looking at him in that pic would ya? He looks like a fireman. Most FDNY members who knew him would likely tell ya that he was a fireman.
He responded to countless incidents to pray for and comfort the victims and members of the FDNY. The attacks on the World Trade Center in 2001 was no different. Father Judge was there from the beginning.
At 09:59 am that morning, when the South Tower collapsed; Father Judge was in the lobby of the North Tower. Debris and rubble from the South Tower collapse filled the North Tower lobby and took Father Judge’s life.
He is officially listed as the 1st victim of the attacks. His body bag was labeled “0001”.
I will never forget the images of those 4 men carrying his body from the rubble in a chair.
His funeral was held on September 15th and was attended by more than 3,000 people. His helmet was presented to Pope John Paul II and there has even been talks of Sainthood. Streets have been given his name, statutes have been erected, and medals awarded..
So as you can see, the position of fire Department Chaplin is not one to be taken lightly.
Father Judge set the bar high.
I’m wondering how many of your departments have a Chaplin Program? How is it working? Do the members find it helpful? Do you have any advise for our members or for Reverend Webb as we begin building ours?
I did find a site with some information on Chaplin Programs for those of you who, like us; may not have one in place or may be thinking about starting one. Check out Chaplin Fellowship Ministries for more.
That’s gonna do it for now …. for all you local folks, don’t forget to come out and support The Roanoke Rampage as we take on the Chicago Fire Department in full contact football for charity this Saturday, 3 pm at Salem Memorial Stadium.
Until next time… stay safe and in house!

Once called "The Week of Work," the annual meeting of SVHE was and is unlike many other academic gatherings. Papers in progress are presented in various interdisciplinary seminars and in the Call for Papers working groups, where each receives thoughtful and constructive response from participants. Plenary sessions give opportunity for coherent exploration of a thematic focus, with ample time as well for discussion with speakers. Although most Fellows are professionally involved with matters of higher education, many are from other ways of being. In addition, families and partners are welcomed as full participants in all sessions (with special programming provided for those under 18). We seek to create a setting where we are not just "managing knowledge" but also trying to live toward wisdom and committing ourselves as whole human persons to 'the sterner discipline of seeking a common good in human affairs."
Over the 4-5 days, we pursue these goals in formal and informal ways, including gathering for:
Morning Group Seminars which explore themes from "Historical Fiction" to "Theorizing Culture, "Forms of Autobiography to "Sustainability" and more. The only rules are first names only and confidentiality when appropriate to sustain a safe haven for frank discussions.
Afternoon and Working Groups as well as Plenaries that delve into thematic concerns with both personal and public dimensions.
Programs for the young and not so young "Society Brats" who have sailed on the Chesapeake Bay as well as discovered we are all at least bicultural. Several have grown up to be Fellows and serve on the Board of Directors.
Long conversations at breaks, over meals, and into the evening such that laryngitis is the only threat to the playing with ideas that is our mainstay.
We rotate the location of our conference to accommodate our membership, favoring institutions with a strong commitment to providing a liberal arts education.Infibeam Pi: Is this India's killer IT product?
One of the biggest criticisms levelled at the Indian tech industry is that it has been unable to really come out with a "killer product" -- the kind of product that catches the public's imagination at large. Well, with the Pi e-book reader, that criticism might just have been answered resoundingly.
On a level playing field, the device would not have the hardware or connectivity muscle to take on Amazon's mighty Kindle, but given the terms on which Amazon has brought its e-book reader to India, the Pi is more than capable of slaying it.
First things first, the Pi bears more than a passing resemblance to the Kindle. It has the same e-ink display surrounded by a white plastic front, although it does not have a QWERTY keypad, but just a navigational pad with metallic keys on the side for increasing font size, going back to the previous menu, adding bookmarks and so on.
Some might feel that its six-inch display is on the smaller side, but we found it just perfect for reading. And at 180 gms, it is light enough to slip into a coat pocket, like any decent bestseller.

Simple specs
In terms of specs, the Pi does not seem a heavyweight. It has 512 MB onboard storage (expandable using SD cards) and has no wireless connectivity options -- the only way you can transfer books to it is through a USB cable connected to a computer, and you can forget about browsing bookstores or the Internet on it.
However, compare it with the Kindle in India, where you have to pay for even downloading free e-books and have to shell out close to ten dollars for every book purchase, and you will start seeing where the Pi scores.
The Pi simply lets you transfer any PDF book to it -- you could have bought it from any site or any location, and there is no premium pricing involved. The reader also supports PDF, EPUB, HTML, TXT, MOBI, DOC, formats, lets you play MP3 files, and view images in JPG, BMP, PNG formats. A huge bonus is support for Indic languages, including Hindi and Sanskrit and most official Indian languages.
And while the greyscale display might put iPad fan boys off, we cannot argue with a battery life that lasts for almost a week -- you can just take this along on your short trips and leave the charger behind.
Click NEXT to read about Pi's pricing.
Pricing power
Top that off with the fact that the Pi costs Rs 9,999, which is almost half of the Rs 18,000-odd that the Kindle commands in India, and you can see why we are so impressed with the device. Yes, it has its rough edges - we do wish lines would not break for no reason at all, and its penchant for rebooting can be a bit of a pain.
Availability also seems to be an issue: Although one can order it from, it is largely absent from most electronic stores, where Indian consumers tend to go to buy their gadgets.
We would have no qualms crowning the Pi as India's killer IT product, were it not for the availability issue. It may not offer as much as the Kindle, but it offers a great deal at a much lower price. And in a price conscious market, that counts for a lot.
Still, all said and done, if it is a simple e-book reader you are looking for in India, we think this is your best option. By far.
It is not too expensive (compared to the Kindle), is lightweight, looks sleek enough, has decent battery and storage life and supports most popular text formats.
Most e-book readers could not ask for more.

Superwhites is back!
The aim of the Superwhites event is to promote the Friuli-Venezia Giulia region, Italy's most famous white wine area. Here, the tradition of wine production goes hand in hand with wonderful gastronomic delicacies such San Daniele ham and goose liver, and these products and others were combined with resounding success last year at the first edition of Superwhites in New York and Rome.The best way to introduce a region and allow people to get to know it better is through its tastes and flavours. This is the formula we will be using once more this year in three meetings, organized by Slow Food Friuli, during which we shall introduce 45 Friuli-Venezia Giulia wineries specially selected from the Italian Wines guide, a joint publication by Slow Food and Gambero Rosso. For several years now, this leading guide, now in its fourteenth edition, has also been published in English and German. The wines to be tasted during Superwhites'have been selected from the list of those which achieved the highest ratings (Two or Three Glass symbols) in the 2001 edition of the guide.The dates for 'Superwhites 2001' are:New York, April 21-22Zurich, second half of October (to be confirmed)Rome, November 17-18The three events will offer a precious opportunity to take part in Taste Workshops and a Grand Tasting of the great food and wine of Friuli Venezia Giulia.To book your 'appointment with taste', call Slow Food USA for the New York event (Toll-free in the United States: 1-800-SLOWFOOD, from Canada and within New York: 1-212-988-5146, email: pmartins@slowfood.com).The booking service for the events in Zurich and Rome will be operational as of early August 2001.

Bond markets of financially stressed euro zone countries have received only a short-term relief from European Central Bank President Mario Draghi’s indications earlier this month that the central bank may resume its bond buying program, although probably in a somewhat tweaked form compared to the currently dormant one.
Uncertainties regarding the details of a new round of bond buying are likely to keep the pressure on Spanish and Italian bonds, even as mid-August sessions have seen some relative calm due to a break in bond issuance and light trading volumes. On the flip side, this keeps German bond prices high, and yields low. Bond prices and yields move in opposite directions.
“While we doubt that the ECB action can entice private investors that abandoned the peripheral markets back in the short run, it seems equally unlikely that the flight into Bunds even increases as long as these risks remain in check,” said Peter Schaffrik, head of European rates strategy at RBC Capital Markets.
German bond yields, which have hit successive record lows in the past few months in markets as investors rushed into the perceived safety of the euro zone’s benchmark issuer, have been trading in negative territory at the short end of the yield curve for months.
In addition, German borrowing costs at debt auctions with up to two years of maturity, have also hit negative levels. This means that investors effectively pay to the German state for the privilege of buying its debt.
Against this backdrop, it came as no surprise in May that Germany set the coupon, which represents the level of return an investor should receive if it holds on to a debt until maturity, at 0% on its current benchmark Schatz.
At maturity, holders of this bond will get back only their principal invested but won’t get any scheduled interest payments until then. The German Finance Agency closed out at the time to set negative coupons on Schatz to be issued in the future.
But more bonds out of Germany with a 0% coupon remain a possibility.Duke Energy Indiana seeks energy sourcesOctober 25th, 2007 in Technology / Energy & Green Tech
Duke Energy Indiana issued a request for proposals Wednesday, seeking bids for power generated from renewable energy sources.
The company said it is interested in talking with potential suppliers about purchased power agreements or purchasing a generating facility.
Officials said the request for proposals is specifically aimed at renewable sources, including sun, wind, water and organic matter. The company, seeking up to 200 megawatts by 2011, said proposals must be submitted by Jan. 15.
."
Duke has approximately 4 million U.S. customers and has nearly 37,000 megawatts of electric generating capacity in the Midwest and the Carolinas and natural gas distribution services in Ohio and Kentucky.
"Duke Energy Indiana seeks energy sources." October 25th, 2007.Poet Sri Jayadeva was born in 11th century in Bindu Bilva village near Puri Jagannath Temple in Orissa. His wife Padmavati, was an accomplished temple dancer. He was very much influenced by the culture and devotion of Vaishnava Brahmanas. It is believed that Sri Chaitanya Maha Prabhu also visited him.
Poet Jayadeva's magnum opus "Gita Govinda' is one of the most popular compositions in Sanskrit language, describing the divine love of Radha and Krishna. It is lyrical poetry divided into 'Prabandhas' which contain couplets grouped into eights called 'Ashtapadis'. The poems describe the attraction between Radha and Krishna,their separation, their yearning and
union with the assistance of Radha's Sakhee (confidante) are very engrossing. Ashtapadis have a very important place in Indian Classical dance and music.
Excellent lyricism, exquisite vocabulary, alliteration and description of
divine love have unique place in literature. Gita Govinda overflows with
'Madhura Bhakti' known as one of the nine forms of devotion to God.
I have my own limits to venture translating fully the descriptions of
sports of love. Only Jayadeva who was immersed in devotion to the divine couple Radha and Krishna could outpour his ecstasy and admiration uniquely.
I acknowledge my hearty gratitude to 'Vavilla Rama Sastry & Sons' whose publication 'Gita Govinda Kavyam', a Telugu translation of Poet Jayadeva's
immortal classic, helped me to understand the Sanskrit work.We're 1,601 FUN FRIENDS!

By now, you’ve seen the Mortal Kombat Rebirth movie. If not, watch it. We’ll wait.
Jeri Ryan, the actress who played Sonya Blade in the movie and Seven of Nine in Star Trek: Voyager, explained what the movie is for. “It’s not a game trailer,” Ryan tweeted. “Actually was made for the director to sell WB on his vision for a reimagined MK film.”
“I did it as a favor to a friend,” Ryan continues,”No idea yet what WB’s reaction to it was. And I’m not sure how you can contact WB to push them to make it.”
With all of the Internet buzz, Warner Brothers is, without question, aware of it.Not applicable
1. Field of the Invention
The present invention relates generally to commercial transactions and more specifically to a method and system for using relevant customer preferences in real time to customize a commercial transaction.
2. Related Art
Business intelligence information about a customer is helpful for marketing sales and services to the customer. This is particularly relevant to internet purchasing where use of personalized customer preferences can be employed to market additional product and services to a prior customer. On the internet, a customer preference profile is typically obtained by requesting the customer to respond to a list of questions asking about demographic personal information and other factors that relate to buying preferences or from tracking the customer's activity on the internet. The company then uses a computer program to model a profile for the client and to prepare a general model that predicts the outcome of future customer contacts.
This approach is problematic for several reasons. First, customer compliance is often incomplete as the customer finds the process tedious and personally invasive. In addition, it is time consuming for each business to collect, store and process this information. Moreover, retail merchants are not expert in modeling the input data and often fail to apply sufficient resources to properly use the data. As a further consideration, there may be potential liability associated with collecting and storing of customer personal information which needs to be protected from unauthorized access by others.
Thus, it would be beneficial to have a method and system that makes available in real time and at the point-of-contact, information about the customer demographics, buying preferences and lifestyle that need not be developed by the merchant. In addition, it would be useful if the information could be relevant to the customer but not personal to the customer.
The present invention is directed to methods and systems for solving the problem alluded to above, by using an individual merchant server computer with memory for storing a geodemographic database of transaction relevant customer information or a syndicate between two or more merchant server computers and a commonly shared system server computer with memory for storing a geodemographic database of transaction relevant customer information.
In the stand alone merchant server computer embodiment, when a customer computer accesses via a network the merchant server computer, the merchant server computer obtains customer identification information from the customer computer. The information is used to store an anonymous identification tag on the customer computer, for example as a cookie, the tag providing an address to a segment of the database of transaction relevant customer information that is relevant to the customer. When the customer computer later contacts the merchant server computer, the anonymous identification tag is retrieved from the customer computer and the tag is used to retrieve the segment of the transaction relevant customer information from the memory storing database, which is then used by the merchant server computer to customize communication between the merchant server computer and the customer computer.
In the syndicate embodiment, when a customer computer accesses via a network a merchant's server computer of the syndicate, the merchant server computer obtains customer identification information from the customer computer. The information is used to store an anonymous identification tag on the example as a cookie, the tag providing an address to a segment of the database of transaction relevant customer information that is relevant to the customer. When the customer later accesses any merchant server computer of the syndicate, the accessed syndicate merchant server computer retrieves the anonymous identification tag and uses it to access and retrieve transaction relevant customer information from the commonly shared system server computer memory. The retrieved information is used by the merchant to customize communication with the customer in real time and at the point-of-contact.
Also provided herein are additional embodiments as well as systems for carrying out the methods discussed above.
The various features and advantages of the present invention will become more clearly appreciated as a detailed description of the preferred embodiment is given with reference to the appended drawings in which;
FIG. 1 is a schematic of several embodiments of the invention providing an overview of the architecture of the customer PC, merchant server computer and database-containing server computer interactions; and
FIGS. 2 through 4 are general flow chart diagrams of digital information transmission according to an embodiment of the present invention.
FIGS. 1-4 show various embodiments of the invention. FIG. 1 is diagram showing two embodiments of the computing system formed in accordance with the present invention. In one embodiment depicted in FIG. 1, syndicate 10 of merchant server computers such as computers 11, and 16 are linked to a commonly shared system server computer 13, which contains a memory 15 for a transaction relevant customer information database.
As used herein, transaction relevant customer information includes information that a merchant would consider useful at the point-of contact with the customer. Point-of-contact includes contact between the merchant and the customer where the customer is seeking information about products or services and/or is seeking to enter into a transaction with the merchant.
Transaction relevant customer information preferably include geodemographic customer buying preferences and lifestyles. Geodemographic information refers to household buying preferences that are not linked to any single household, but are linked to all households within a geographic location. Geodemographic information is preferably kept in a separate database from other transaction relevant customer information such as personal information and past purchasing information. The use of geodemographic information is preferred, because it is not personal to the individual customer as in the case of the foregoing mentioned personal information. Thus, by not utilizing personal information, the privacy of the customer can be more completely protected and respected.
Returning to FIG. 1, in use, customer personal computer (“PC”) such as personal computer 12, uses the internet for example through an internet server provider (ISP) 14 to access and register as indicated above 1 at a syndicate merchant server computer such as the computer 16. The registration prompts the customer to send customer identification information including postal information containing the customer's zip code, to the merchant server computer 16. The merchant server computer receives the information and causes the preparation of an anonymous identification tag, which is later sent to the customer PC 12 and stored therein preferably as a cookie. The identification tag preferably is an address to a segment of the geodemographic database that contains customer purchasing preferences and lifestyles that are relevant to the customer.
Preferably, the customer identification information is based on the registration information sent by the customer PC 14 to the merchant server computer 16. The anonymous identification tag preferably contains an address to the sector of the database containing customer preferences and lifestyles relevant to the customer. The anonymous identification tag also preferably contains no specific customer information.
In order to create the anonymous identification tag, the merchant server computer 16 sends as indicted at 2 the customer identification information regarding the customer to the system server computer 13 which geodemographically codes the information and stores this in the system server computer database memory 15. For example, the customer ZIP code is geodemographically coded by generating a segment address code which identifies that segment of database that is relevant to the customer. The code is stored in the database and all personal information identifying information including the customer's address or ZIP code is deleted. As indicated at 3, the database sector identifying code is then sent to the merchant server computer which uses it to create the anonymous identification tag for the customer PC. At a future time when the customer PC accesses as indicated at 5 a syndicate merchant server computer, such as the computer 11, and the merchant server computer retrieves the tag as indicated at 6 from the customer PC 12.
The merchant server computer sends as indicted at 7 the retrieved tag to the system server computer which uses the tag to locate and retrieve transaction relevant customer information stored in the memory geodemographic database. This information is directly related to the customers transaction preferences. The retrieved information is sent as indicted at 8 to the requesting merchant server computer 11 which processes this information to prepare a customized communication that is sent as indicted at 9 to the customer PC.
A stand alone merchant server computer embodiment is also depicted in FIG. 1. Where the merchant computer is not part of a syndicate and yet is constructed in accordance with the present invention. A stand alone merchant server computer 17 is connected to its own transaction relevant customer information geodemographic database memory 18. In this case, steps 1-9 in FIG. 1 are conducted as appropriate between a customer PC and the stand alone merchant server computer 17 and between the merchant server computer 17 and its transaction relevant customer information geodemographic database memory 18.
In a similar manner to the syndicate example, an anonymous identification tag is created from custom postal information (e.g., the ZIP code). The tag bears database sector identification information so that relevant customer information can be retrieved relating to a group of consumers residing in a given geographic area, without identifying the customer or storing persona, private information regarding a particular customer.
The customized communication is the merchant's web page which has been modified based on the transaction relevant customer information received by the merchant. Alternatively or in addition, the customized communication may include providing a customer service representative (sales representative) with information about the customer's buying preferences. This information may be used as part of communications on-line or by telephone between the customer service representative and the customer. In any case, the customized communication results in a more personalized experience by the customer and increased satisfaction and sales.
The customer PC can be coupled to the merchant server in one or more ways, including an internet connection (e.g. WWW) or a telephone wire connection using modulator/demodulators (modem) within the customer PC and merchant server computer. Other types of electronic communication devices can also be used by the customer such as a personal communication device, interactive television, and the like can be used provided that an identification can be stored on the customer's device.
Connections from the merchant server computer to the system server computer can be accomplished in various ways, including communication over cellular telephone systems or other wireless links such as microwave or infrared communication links, Ethernet, token ring or other local area or wide area network communications systems, internet communications, satellite communications, fiber optic communications, and the like. Communications between the syndicate merchant server computers and the shared system server computer can be secured by methods well known in the art such as by encryption to protect transfer of confidential customer information.
The customer PC can communicate with merchant server computer through the WWW or Internet-type network in a known manner. Thus, the customer PC can use an HTML-compatible browser (e.g., Netscape Navigator™ or Microsoft Internet Explorer™) to specify a link to a merchant server computer via a Uniform Resource Locator (URL).
As indicated above, transaction relevant customer information is sent as a data stream from the system server computer to the merchant computer that sends the customer identification tag. The data is preferably processed by a data processing program on the merchant's server computer which uses the data for customizing communication to the customer, preferably by a web page. The data processing program can filter data, and/or process the information resulting in the selective presentation of products and/or services to the customer that relates to their predicted buying preferences. Transaction relevant customer information also may be processed in a predefined manner for each merchant by a program at the system server computer, the result being a document formatted according to products such as in a web based catalog may differ under customization and may involve custom advertising of products and services outside of the catalog. In the latter case, the customized web page can provide a hyperlink to additional information about the product, its availability and cost.
The database memory associated with the system server computer includes one or more hard disk drives for storing the information. The database memory can comprise separate databases of information preferably located in different hard drives. For example, the database memory can contain one hard drive or set of linked hard drives for storing personal customer information as well as past purchase information while a second hard drive or set of linked hard drives can be used to store the geodemographic information.
FIGS. 2-4 illustrate a method of the present invention which avoids storing personal confidential information about the customer by utilizing specifically geodemographic customer information. Using the inventive syndicate system 10 as above (indicated at box 201), when a customer PC contacts a stand alone merchant server computer or a merchant server computer of a syndicate (indicated at box 202), the merchant server computer requests postal mailing address designed to link the customer PC to the stand alone merchant or to the merchants of the syndicate when the customer again contacts and accesses the stand alone merchant server computer or any merchant server computers of the syndicate (indicated at box 206). At that time, the merchant server computer retrieves the TAG stored on the customer PC (indicated at box 207). The merchant server computer sends the TAG to its own database or to the shared database of transaction relevant customer information (indicated at box 208). The system server computer or stand alone merchant computer uses the TAG to look up customer buying preferences and lifestyles in the segment of the geodemographic database identified by the TAG (indicated at box 209).
The customer preference data is retrieved by merchant server computer from the stand alone or the shared geodemographic database (indicated at box 210). The stand alone merchant server computer or syndicate merchant server computer processes the data and uses it to customize the merchant's web page which is then sent to the customer (indicated at box 211). The steps from when the customer with the identification tag accesses a merchant server computer (stand alone or syndicate merchant) and receives a custom web page from the merchant server computer should occur very quickly so that the customer does not become impatient.
Geodemographic databases generally cover geographic buying preferences for products relating to all products and services, including telecommunication, energy, cable, retail, media and financial services. More specifically, the databases contain buyer preference information as follows: Telecom, relating to call waiting, caller ID, and additional lines; energy, relating to heat pumps, load control, and gas dryers; cable, relating to pay-per-view, cable radio and movie channels; retail, relating to jeans, shoes and jackets; media, relating to newspaper, radio and television; and financial, relating to banking, insurance, and brokerage. Geodemographic databases are well known in the art and include those from CACI (Arlington Va.) (e.g., ACORN), Experion (Orange, Calif.) (e.g., MOSAIC) and Claritas (San Diego, Calif.) (e.g. PRIZM).
For example, PRIZM is a reliable and accurate lifestyle segmentation system updated regularly to contain the latest information. PRIZM Cluster analysis begins with the U.S. Census database, which contains thousands of demographic data items from small neighborhood areas across the country. Also taped is a demographic sources and information from millions of consumer purchase records. The PRIZM model is based on demographic and lifestyle factors that best define a neighborhood type and predict consumer behavior including social rank, mobility, urbanization, household composition, ethnicity and housing. PRIZM assignments are built from the block group, the smallest piece of standard census geography for which information available. This ensures that the system accurately reflects both subtle variations in the population density within a neighborhood as well as key differences between neighborhood types. The result is a 62-cluster PRIZM system providing a flexible framework for decision making that's consistent from one level of geography to another. For instance, the PRIZM assignments for five-digit ZIP Codes can be accurately translated into PRIZM assignments for census blocks, census block groups, census tracts, or ZIP+4 areas. This ability to “upshift” or “downshift” from one level of geography to another—with total consistency—is a feature of PRIZM.

The present invention can be applied to electronic on-line shopping systems which allow a user to remotely purchase goods and services from a variety of different on-line merchants over a distributed computer network such as the Internet. In such systems, the on-line merchant publishes an on-line catalog which can be viewed interactively by the end user at a personal computer. These catalogs include pictures, descriptions, and pricing information for the products and/or services of the respective merchants. In World Wide Web (“Web”) based implementations, on-line catalogs are generally in the form of hypertext documents which are hosted by merchant Web sites which are accessed using a standard Web browser application which runs on the user computer. On-line catalogs for multiple merchants may alternatively be hosted by a centralized computer of an on-line services network, such as MSN™, or by an Internet site which is accessed using a proprietary client application (such as the client application of eShop Inc.).
In either case, the present invention can be used to customize a stand alone or syndicate merchant's on-line shopping web page that is sent to a customer whose computer has an identification tag accessible to the merchant server computer. As described above, the stand alone or syndicate merchant's server computer retrieves the identification tag from the cookie file on the customer's computer and uses the tag to select and retrieve in real-time, relevant demographic and buyer preference information from the database. The merchant server computer uses the retrieved marketing information to customize the shopping web page that is sent to the customer.
The use of a customized communication such as a web page resulting from the methods and systems of the present invention, provides the ability to market a broad range of products and services. The relevant demographic and buyer preference information obtained in real-time and at the point-of-contact with a repeat customer to the syndicate allows for more personalized web page browsing, increasing web site “stickiness” and resulting in increased sales and customer satisfaction.
The present methods and systems also provide a valuable cue for cross-selling strategies by delivering marketing decision information online directly to the customer service representative. It enhances marketing efforts without sacrificing risk policies, particularly in the case where personal customer information is limited to postal address information. Use of geodemographic databases makes available thousands of national product profiles from dozens of categories of consumer behavior and accommodates custom profiling for more precise targeting of products and services. This approach also eliminates guess work on the part of customer service representatives, because the recommended products or services output in the customized communication are rank-ordered by the likelihood-to-buy index. Opportunity costs are avoided by marketing other products/services at the beginning of the account life-cycle..The Engineering Life - Around the Web Everyone Needs a Spiderbot, No One Knows Why Caleb Kraft, Chief Community Editor1/10/2014 02:11 PM EST 2 comments post a comment NO RATINGSLogin to Rate Tweet Everyone who has seen this video instantly exclaims their desire for one, but what would they do with it?"I need one of those!" This is almost the exact same response I get every time I've shown someone this video. Everyone wants one. Every single person I've shown, even those who hate spiders. There's something alluring about this little fella that just draws people in, despite its arachnid-esque physique. However, I have been following up that video with a simple question: "Can you think of a single use for this?" This question usually illicits a long pause, followed by abject silence. No one can think of a single use for this contraption. "But it's so cool!" everyone retorts, and I completely agree. I still want one, though I know that the only pleasure it would give me would be in the first couple days of operation, and then possibly showing it to people who hadn't seen one before. Someone brought up the fact that I have a quadcopter and asked, "What use does that serve?" Well, honestly, most of the time it serves none. It was amusing for a few days, but I only drag it out now if I need to shoot some aerial footage. That ability to capture aerial footage is a pretty big checkmark in the useful column. One friend told me to think of it like a radio-controlled car. They have no use other than the fact that people enjoy driving and racing them. I can grasp this idea. However, the spider bot is so fragile that I find it difficult to envision people actively enjoying driving it around for very long. Just watch this video and pay attention to Adam Savage talking about breaking his in various stupidly easy ways. In all seriousness, I do understand why people have this hobby. It is kind of fun to play the "what use is it?" game, but I think at this point it might also be fun to share what the draw is to this kind of robot. There are groups of people who spend their hobby time working on hexapods and octopods that have natural motion. For them, the fun is creating these complex physical behaviors. The ability to have not only a biologically inspired walking gate, but multiple variations that are kinematically correct is quite a thrill for them. Just as an artist relishes in the perfect transition from a hot to a cold color, a spiderbot enthusiast will get tingles down their spine when they succcessfully nail down the thorax compensation for a sideways weight shift. In short, for the people who participate in this hobby, it is usually the process of creating and refining the thing that offers more fulfillment than having the final product be a usefull robot. This specific one is the T8 made by Robugtix. Coming in at roughly $2,500 it is quite an investment for a toy. However, they're working on a newer and much cheaper version called the T8X. You can find its order form here. The price for this beauty ranges from $499 up to $749 depending on when you order. The lower price is a pre-order discount. — Caleb Kraft, Chief Community Editor, EE TimesJulia Mancuso speeds down the course on her way to clock the third fastest time during a training session for a women's World Cup downhill race on Feb. 22.

I've been waiting for this trailer ever since Wayne White told me about it last time he was in town — at the opening for Slow Burn, an exhibit he mounted alongside Kurt Wagner at Zeitgeist. (I wrote a review of that show here, but if you want a real tutorial on White, check out Ridley's 2009 cover story on him.)
Beauty Is Embarrassing is the feature-length debut of filmmaker Neil Berkeley, and it looks like a comprehensive, hilarious, in-depth portrait of the man responsible for the playfully surreal aesthetic of of Pee-Wee's Playhouse and the look of award-winning music videos such as Peter Gabriel's "Big Time" and Smashing Pumpkins' "Tonight, Tonight" — not to mention basically an entire generation's idea of what big, block-lettered, tongue-in-cheek design looks like.
The doc features interviews with everyone from Paul Reubens to Todd Oldham, who published the gorgeous coffee-table book of White's work a few years ago. Look for further coverage of the film in upcoming Scene issues, and of course here on Country Life.CHI 2010 Workshop May 7 or 8, 2011 (final date to be announced)
Call for Participation
Large interactive displays are now common in public urban life. Museums, libraries, public plazas, and architectural facades already take advantage of interactive technologies for visual and interactive information presentation. Researchers and practitioners from such varied disciplines as art, architecture, design, HCI, and media theory have started to explore the potential and impact of large display installations in public urban settings.
This workshop aims to provide a platform for researchers and practitioners from different disciplines such as art, architecture, design, HCI, social sciences, and media theory to exchange insights on current research questions in the area. The workshop will focus on to the following topics: how to design large interactive display installations that promote engaging experiences and go beyond playful interaction, how different interaction models shape people’s experience in urban spaces, and how to evaluate their impact.
Workshop Goals & Topics
The goal of this one-day CHI 2011 workshop is to cross-fertilize insights from different disciplines, to establish a more general understanding of large interactive displays in public urban contexts, and to develop an agenda for future research directions in this area. Rather than focusing on paper presentations, this workshop aims to trigger active and dynamic group discussions around the following topics:
Beyond Playful Interaction
A number of studies found that large display installations invite for playful interaction but often fail to convey meaningful experiences related to content. This raises the following questions:
- How can we design installations that endure people’s attention past the initial novelty effect and direct the interest toward the content?
- What design strategies can be applied to promote an active individual and social exploration and discussion of the presented information?
A number of interaction techniques have been explored for large displays in public spaces ranging from interaction via cell phones, to direct-touch or full body interaction. We would like to discuss:
- How do different interaction methods shape people’s experience of large display installations in urban spaces?
- How do interaction methods differ from each other in terms of triggering interaction and engagement with the presented content?
Different quantitative and qualitative methods have been applied to evaluate people’s experience and use of large display installations in public spaces. During the workshop we would like to discuss:
- How can we evaluate the "success" of large display installations in urban spaces?
- How can particular aspects of public large display installations such as engagement be evaluated?
- What kind of evaluation methods are most effective in different progress stages (design phase/installment phase)?
For more details on the workshop please refer to our extended abstract and workshop proposal.
Submission Details
Submit a position paper (maximum 4 pages) to largedisplaysinurbanlife@gmail.com by January 14, 2011 using the CHI extended abstract format. The paper should describe experiences, works in progress, or theories around designing and/or evaluating large interactive displays in public urban settings. We plan to explore approaches and insights from different disciplines to this topic so submissions from art, architecture, design, HCI, media theory, and social science are highly encouraged. We welcome all methodological approaches and techniques centered around the topic of large interactive displays in urban life.
At least one author of each accepted position paper needs to register for the workshop and for one or more days of the CHI conference itself.
Important Dates
Submission Deadline: January 14, 2011
Notification of acceptance: February 11, 2011
Workshop: May 7 or 8, 2011 (final date to be announced)

It’s that time of year when things are crazy. You are probably slammed at work trying to finish year-end projects while preparing for the holidays. But don’t let all of your work get in the way of enjoying this special time of year. To enjoy the holiday season more, here are a few tips…
• Review your day.
There is a lot going on so at the end of each day take some time to plan your schedule for the next day.
What do you need to get finished?
Make a list with the amount of time you need to complete each task. List your top priorities first. Then, when you wake up the next day, you’ll know what you need to work on and finish that day.
• Schedule “me” time.
When you have a busy schedule, it can be so easy to rush from one activity to the next without taking a break. You go to work, drive the kids to wherever they need to be, shop, cook, clean, do laundry, etc. At the end of the day, you collapse on your bed and either fall asleep right away or lie awake thinking of all the things you need to get done the next day. This is not a good schedule for your health or stress levels.
Instead, schedule some time for you. Take time out to take a fun exercise class, go for a walk, get a massage, read a book… whatever you like to do that gives you a moment to relax and get your thoughts together.
• Get help.
Whether you want to believe it or not, sometimes its impossible to do it all. And if you try to do it all, what are the chances that you’ll be able to do everything well?
Instead of running around like a crazy person and doing everything so-so due to a lack of time, why not ask for help?
Maybe you can hire an intern or part-time employee, give your kids some extra chores to do or seek out family and friends to help you with shopping and odd jobs? It may cost a little extra money and time to give out some of your responsibilities to others, but it will be will worth it. The work will get done, and you’ll avoid spreading yourself too thin and getting sick.
Don’t let the holidays pass you by
This is a very special time of year to appreciate what you have and spread goodwill and cheer. But if you are stuck behind your desk, up late worrying about work or in bed sick, the season will pass you by.
Instead, make a schedule, including “me” time, and stick to it. And if you find that you Are just overwhelmed with all the things you have to do, find some people to help you. Then, maybe you’ll be able to relax, get your work done, AND enjoy the holiday season!

What a foxy new wash from the masters of the skinny only problem I have with them was that they were only 1% lycra - 2-3% would have felt much better. I only buy stretch jeans, but these didn't have enough give in them in the thighs and seat to make them comfortable; I think it has to do with the dye or thread they use with this color; stiff and kind of itchy in the summer. My other jeans are stretchy enough that they feel good going on, but with these I am still trying to get them "broken in". I love that they are black on the inside; I like to cuff them and wear them with heels, and I have been told the contrasting cuff looks really good. Hope this helps
I usually take a 32 in J Brand, but these feel a bit loose in the hips & waist. They look like they would be tight judging by the picture, but overall, they feel great, but just a little loose in the caboose! I will have to put darts in the back for a snugger fit in the hips. The fabric/finish is beautiful - there is nothing else like Silver Fox out there! Very cute jeans!Pretty sure they are referring to old school ones with the wood panel siding that weigh 1400 lbs and use the energy of a small city to run.

- Excellent product
- I took this out for the first time about 3 weeks ago and I have been addicted ever since. The very first object I looked at was Jupiter since the Moon wasn't up(which turned out to be a good thing because the sky was much darker) I could clearly see the bands of Jupiter and its 4 moons. After a little bit of time I quickly got the hang of the setting circle and was able to find the Orion Nebula. Since then I have had 3 clear nights and have knocked off about 10 Messier objects and I have been having a blast doing so(while learning the sky).
The customer service at OpticsMart is amazing as well, David has been great.
Only tip I can give is read the manual the information is great and definitely helped this beginner astronomer :)
- New AD8 Dobsonian
- I ordered this scope from opticsmart after waiting for several weeks to get one from another company "we wont mention any names" that had them on back order and kept pushing the ship date. I placed the order on Wednesday 12/10/14 it shipped that same day and I received it on Friday 12/12/14. Wow what a great company this arrived quickly and in good shape very well packed. I promptly proceeded to put it together and get it all setup. Now I just had to wait until the cloudy sky curse lifted. Finally Monday 12/15/14 I had clear weather so I got everything setup right before dusk and waited to begin my viewing for the first time. On my goodness I just spent like 5 hours just scanning the sky looking at things with the included 30mm 2" eyepiece. I look forward to getting to do much more star gazing with this in the very near future.
- Perfect for a beginner
- After a month of online researching and reading countless reviews I decided
to go with the AD8. It was definitely the right choice!! I have always been interested
in the universe around me but I didn't think you could get these breath-taking views
with a telescope at this price! I ordered the base package due to my tight budget and
I am not disappointed...I LOVE IT! This is my first scope and I was a bit worried about the size but the AD8 is quite easy to put together and move around. The quality of this beast is AMAZING!!
If you are looking for a first scope go with the AD8. You will not regret it. Accessories included are awesome but I would recommend the 2x Barlow I will be ordering one very soon!!
- The Best!
- After several months since I purchased this telescope, I have compared it side by side with
a 4" APO refractor, a C6 SCT, and a TV Ranger. The views in these smaller scopes are no
match for the AD8. It is like watching a regular movie and then watching it in blueray. This
was my experience with the views of Saturn, it looks 3D, very sharp.
If you want a complete package buy the tweaker's dream package and the Halo setting
circles, it is worth it. Definitely the best bang for the buck.
- Viewed the supernova SN2014J in M82!
- What a view! This is the first "review" of my 8" Apertura Dob. I've had a few observing sessions with this scope and have been favorably impressed. BUT, the other night I viewed this latest Type Ia supernova and the view was spectacular! Clean image of M82 (and M81) thru my 9mm 100-degree Agena EP. Even resolved a 13.4 magnitude star, in close proximity to M82. All of this with city lights all around. Amazing scope.
- Love this telescope!
- I have owned my AD8 for over a year now and have been meaning to write this review for some time. Simply stated, I love this telescope. It arrived in perfect condition with easy to follow instructions. Collimation took a small bit of practice (and patience) but I've only had to do it once. Over the past year I have schlepped this scope back and forth in the trunk of my car a couple hundred times as well as subjecting it to temperatures ranging from 50-85F and it has remained perfectly aligned. The Dobsonian mount rolls smooth as butter and the views are amazing. I live in a large community by the ocean so water vapor and light pollution are a big problem, however, I have had no trouble identifying 105 of 107 Messier objects with ease. I bought a separate OIII filter which fits nicely on the 30mm eyepiece and have started working on planetary nebula. As far as the planets go, you can see the bands on Jupiter and 4 moons (though it is a little bright without a planetary filter), the Cassini division on Saturn's rings, moons, and some albedo features on Mars (again a planetary filter would be helpful). If I had one wish for this telescope it would be a better fitting lens cap for the main tube because it falls off whenever the temperature gets too cold, that said, I have spent many, many happy hours at this telescope and feel it was money well spent.
- Very well made scope, great value.
- To say that I'm impressed with my new AD8 is an understatement. The scope is very well made and the quality is even more than I expected, with the best accessory package that you will find with similar scopes. I should also mention the ease of assembly. I don't think it took more than a half hour to put the scope together from start to finish. I purchased my scope online on Wednesday morning and it was here in central NY. early Friday afternoon, WOW! I've been a faithful Orion customer for years, but decided to try Opticsmart due to the much better value of their Dobsonian packages and from what I've seen so far, I'll be buying from Opticsmart from now on. Thank You.
- Wow! Incredible views!
- Let me start out by saying that this is my first scope. I was a little intimidated about the collimation business before I bought the scope because of what I had read online. I have been saving up for this scope for about nine months, and researching the whole time. When I knew I was getting close to affording one, my research had led me to Opticsmart because of their legendary customer service. I also liked the package they put together with the scope. A very good deal, in my opinion, especially for one getting started in this hobby. The only decision left for me was to get the AD8 or wait and spring for the AD10. I decided not to wait and bought the AD8, and I'm glad I did.
The scope came in two boxes, all very well packaged. The only thing broken in the box was one of the styrofoam fillers. Even the collimation was very close. I ordered my AD8 on Friday morning with the Tweaker's Dream package so they collimated the scope before shipping. They shipped it using FedEx Home Delivery service, which is normally closed on Sunday and Monday, but because of the holidays coming up, they delivered it on Monday. Wow! Ordered the scope Friday morning, David put the package together for me and got it shipped by 4:00 that day! That's quick. I have Monday and Tuesday off, so I woke up to an early Christmas present on my front porch.
I was so excited, I skipped breakfast and started putting the scope together. I've never been accused of doing anything fast, and I still got this scope together, collimated (slight adjustment to the secondary mirror), and spotting scope aligned in less than an hour. Keep in mind that I have had NO expereince doing this. The instructions in the manual were very clear. Now I just needed to wait for the sun to go down.
I was outside with my scope, ready to go at 6:00 pm waiting for the first star to show up. I don't have a clear view of the horizon in any direction. Too many trees and houses. But by the time Jupiter had risen above the trees, I had found several stars and had even found the Andromeda Galaxy. That one was tough. I could find it with my binoculars, but was having some difficulty pointing the scope in the right place. But I finally found it. I don't have a barlow yet, so Andromeda was just a little bit bigger dust bunny in the night sky. Then it happened. Jupiter finally got above the trees. I pointed my finders scope to the gas giant and looked in the 30mm 2" EP and saw a beautiful planet with slight orange stripes and the four largest moons spread majestically across the view. Wow!!! Now I had seen Io, Ganameade, Callisto and Europa through my binoculars, but they didn't look as beautiful as this! I was amazed that I could make out the signature stripes of the planet. As the night went on, Orion rose and I saw the Orion nebulea. I tried to see the double star Rigel, but I suppose I need more magnification. I just saw one point of light. I'll have to get that Barlow Lens soon. But first, I'll need an observation chair. This night of observing was a little hard on my back and legs. I put the scope up on a table and raised it a couple of feet and that helped, but that wasn't enough to make it comfortable.
I continued gazing at anything and everything I could find. I have to deal with a lot of light pollution, so there is a lot I can't see. But I did see the moon. The moon filter is awesome. It seemed to clarify more detail than I had ever seen before. What a wonderful first light experience. Then, just after midnight, the curse hit. Clouds rolled in. So I brought the scope back in the house.
This scope was so easy to move from one point to another, and it would stay put when I got there. I carefully balanced the scope with minimal friction dialed into the clutch. That extra time paid off. Though I may have had some difficulty finding some things, I think that was more due to light pollution and less to the with the scope. The 8x50 finders scope that came with this scope stayed right on all night. Even after I had removed it to find Andromeda, then put it back on the mount. It was still lined up.
I am very pleased with my purchase. I am very pleased with my scope. The AD10 would have been a little much for me to handle. This AD8 is a perfect size to take out the the back yard or the the next star party. Perhaps, one day I will want more aperture. For now, this is a good fit. If you've ever thought about getting a scope, this is the one to get. Stars are more beautiful through the eyepiece of a high contrast telescope!
Thank you to David Giles and the whole team at Opticsmart for their stellar customer service.
Clear Skies!
- Great scope, even better service!
- Just received my AD8 yesterday (2 days after shipping!) and let me say I couldn't be happier. The scope came shipped in pristine condition, the documentation for setup and collimation was easy to understand and made getting everything up and running a breeze...and wow, getting it out to a dark sky site the views through the 9mm and 30mm supplied EP's was breathtaking. Planets were sharp and bright, the supplied moon filter made moon viewing crisp and incredibly detailed, and the 8" lightbucket made viewing of M31, M35, and M57 mindblowing.
Not to mention that Opticsmart has hands down some of the BEST customer service I've ever dealt with. Live chat was great and when I sent an e-mail in regards as to an estimate of when the scope would be shipped (so I could plan my first light trip with work) I had a reply within the hour. Overall an amazing experience, from ordering to setup to viewing I have nothing bad to say at all.
- With great frustration comes an infinitely greater payoff.
- My initial reaction was, "holy crap this thing is a monster, what have I gotten myself into?" And after hours of building, aligning and focusing, setting up, seeing blurry star-like specks, taking it back upstairs, getting annoyed at everything and everyone, realigning and focusing, figuring out how to the mirrors to give them sharp focus, carrying down and setting up.... then....
Bam!
More stars than I have ever seen in my life. Literally thousands of them with star clusters and constellations and double star systems all in a sparkly bag of diamonds that was shot out of my Star Cannon. Freaking amazing views of the sky tonight! And that was just in about a half hour of observing...
All that hassle was totally worth all the effort to learn how to set up and use my first telescope. What I saw is flooring me and I stopped looking a while ago. This telescope is outstanding and I am glad I got an 8 inch instead of a 10 because this thing is just the right size without getting out of hand. I would recommend this to anyone just starting out, you will not be disappointed remotely. The Universe is a beautiful place and this scope will open the door for you!
- Awesome Deal & Great Customer Service
- I purchased the Apertura AD8 Telescope May 10,2012, after spending a month reading reviews on astronomyforum.net.It arrived in Oklahoma in (2) days.It came well packaged & the only problem was the nylon thumbscrew in finder scope was broken.I called Rex & explained to him the problem he was very courteous & shipped me the new nylon thumb screw right away.We have used the telescope a handful of times.So far we our pleased with our purchased from opticsmart.I have seen saturn as well as venus,mars & the moon.The smoothness of the dob is excellent.Putting it together with the manual was nice.The laser collimator was easy to use with the barlow method.(That's the way i used it with great results)
Us being a complete newbie i would recommend this scope, the quality & views i have seen so far.We (the wife & i ) have enjoyed showing family & friends the awesome views from our scope.The thing about having & great telescope is the great A***** Customer Service that comes with it.If you have any questions with anything they sell feel free to give them a call and Clear Skies! Thanks to all the staff at OpticsMart.com

- Awesome Scope, Awesome Value!
- I just received my AD8 yesterday (only took 5 business days to get here)! The boxes were in perfect shape. Both of them were taken into the garage and I started putting it together. Everything was packed perfectly, and the instructions were very clear. When things started taking shape, I realized a couple of things. 1st, the AD8 (compared to my 4" reflector and 90mm Mak) looked like a real telescope! 2nd, its a little hefty. Not too big a problem around the house, but I'll have to make some adjustments to take it in the motorhome so neither one gets damaged. So, even with high winds at the house, I couldn't stand it and took it outside for a quick peek. Once I lined up the finder, I quickly looked at the moon (amazing), the Orion Nebula (also amazing, and I could even see it in the finder), and finally Jupiter (not so amazing). Unfortunately, I could really see the effects of the high wind with Jupiter and the poor seeing. The other problem I had was with the Crayford focuser. There is no physical problem with it, just me not being used to it and fat fingering it. That's ok, I still need to collimate and will play more with the focuser.
Overall I couldn't be more pleased with my purchase and Opticsmart!! Thanks for a great scope!!
- outstanding
- I received this telescope last week after months of research. I didnt see anything on this telescope until about a week before i ordered it and seen it had more accessories than other 8 inch scopes in this price range. It came in great shape, had it set up in no time thanks to the easy instructions. The sky was perfect that night, the moon looked incredible like you were fixing to land on it, jupiter was amazing i could easily see the bands, orion nebula wow i could go on and on and on well you get it. Good quality great looks i would highly recommend this scope as a first or second scope. Thanks alot Rex keep up the good job your doing, ronnie
- Outstanding Telescope and Awesome Customer Service !!!
- well just to update my previous review, we finally got to use our new scope and must say that it is a most Impressive and SOLID piece of equipment!!! This is the first Telescope that we had ever purchased and we are so pleased with the service we got and even more with the product we received. We are both new to astronomy and researched everything out their about buying a scope and You guys at Opticsmart are First Class!!! We bought this as a Valentines gift to each other and you now have us as Lifetime Customers. So anyhow on to the scope. The most concern we had about getting a reflector scope was the collimation,we didnt exactly know anything about this but wow is it Simple with the included Laser Collimator. very easy to do. the thumbscrews at the front are very nice and really adds that customized feel to it. looking at the stars and planets its just amazing what you can see through this scope.the eyepieces are really easy to change out and everything fits like it should. it was very easy to adjust the finder scope and it only takes a minute to get it right. The views of Jupiter have really been a WOW experiance to be able to see the red bands around it right from my backyard. Incredible. Moving the scope around on its mount is Buttery Smooth in every direction. This is a Quality Product that i would recommend to anyone that is getting started in this hobby and getting it through Opticsmart makes it even better.. They only thing i have to complain about is that the Dobsonian base is to damn big to fit in the trunk of a Chevy Cavalier. So we made it work by setting the base in the back seat and sliding one end of the optic tube into the base and the other end resting on pillows.. Takes up the whole backseat but WOW does it look cool!!! Being noobs like we are we had a bit of apprehension about spending $450 bucks on a scope but i am sure glad we took the leap.. I can honestly say that we will be pleased for years to come with this scope and cant wait to get a barlow lens and some more eyepieces. Thank you Very Much Opticsmart....
- Very nice telescope
- My 5 yr old son received a cheap 60mm refractor for Christmas and he seemed to show an interest in looking up at the night skies. I knew that the cheap one he received for Christmas just wouldn't do, so I started looking for a replacement. I did quite a bit of reading and settled on the idea of a dobsonian in the 8" range. I found multiple vendors and brands before eventually deciding on Opticsmart's Apertura AD8.
I ordered the telescope and two days later it arrived at my door... very impressive considering the price for shipping (free). I opened it and assembled it as per the instructions. Simple to follow and it took about 40 minutes from unboxing to complete assembly. Once assembled I realized this was going to make for a much better viewing experience as compared to the cheap scope my son received for Christmas.
As I read over and over, when you get a new telescope mother nature will be sure to provide bad weather; no exception here. I have had it out 3 times now and love the scope. Couldn't figure out the two screws for the focuser, but a quick call to Opticsmart had that worked out. Operator error on my part. So far we have looked a Jupiter and all its moons, Orion's Nebula, Pleaides, and Venus. All looked great and I was very impressed with the stability of the scope. Finder scope works very well once aligned properly, and maintains alignment very well. I plan to modify a garden cart to help facilitate moves from the garage to the front of the house. Not too heavy, but awkward to move.
Overall I would give this scope 5 out of 5 stars and the service at Optics Mart is top notch!!! I know where I am going to buy when it is time for my new stuff!!!
- Very Impressed
- I ordered my scope on the 5th and I just finished assembling it at 615pm on the 8th!!! Outstanding Job opticsmart!! Everything is just as it looks on your website and I couldnt be more satisfied. You guys are Awesome! After comparing other Dobsonians from Orion and Zhumell and others with my Fiance for the last several months we finally chose Opticsmart. It was very easy to assemble and now if the SKIES werent so cloudy I would be out using it. We decided to get the Tweakers Dream Package and the Velvet Lining is Very Impressive indeed and the Guide Knob is very cool too. Cant wait to test it out and I will Update my Review when we do...Thanks again and Job Well Done!!!
- Great Telescope for a Beginner or Experienced Astronomer!
- I purchased the Apertura AD8 Telescope a few weeks ago after spending several weeks looking at similar 'scopes, and I'm glad I bought this one! The telescope is very solidly constructed, especially the aluminum mounts which secure it to the base. Being a Mechanical Engineer myself, I opened up one of the aluminum altitude (up/down) mounts and found that they had quality ball bearings inside; the altitude motion is very smooth on bearings rather than on other scopes where there is friction with the base. The azimuth (turning) motion is also _very_ smooth as it also incorporates roller bearings, which make it easy to move to the position you need and helps greatly when tracking objects. The included finderscope is great, it is really nice to have a right angle finder which makes viewing a pleasure, and it seems to be of very good optical quality too.
The focuser has several adjustments, one for altering the friction when changing focus and another for locking the focus down when you've adjusted it for an object. It has brass compression rings which are good for keeping your eyepieces in place, and allows you to extend them out of the tube a bit if necessary. As I purchased the Tweaker's Dream Package, my optical tube came "flocked" with black velvet (this is put on by Opticsmart), it was very professionally done and extended all the way to the bottom of the tube. This allows greater resolution by damping out light rays that are not running directly to the primary mirror. The Tweaker's Dream Package also included thumb adjustment screws for collimating the secondary mirror, which are very handy since then you don't have to worry about dropping a screwdriver down the tube onto your mirror! Also added were plastic inserts under the adjustment screws, which serve as a kind of bearing to make it easier to slide the secondary mirror around when collimating. Finally the package gives you a handle to move the telescope around to objects (so you don't have to touch the optical tube on a cold night), and finally a second eyepiece storage tray which attaches to the base (allows you to store an extra three 2" and extra two 1.25" eyepieces).
The quality of the primary mirror seems very good, and it came with a white circle sticker pre-stuck at it's center, which made collimating easy. The included laser collimator is quite good, although it is a lot more accurate when you use it with a Barlow lens to collimate the primary (google "barlowed laser collimation"). You MUST collimate (align) any Newtonian telescope such as this properly to get the optimum performance out of it! This is a skill which takes a little time to learn, but there are clear instructions in the included manual.
Overall, this is a great telescope, and unlike many similar ones, comes with an optional extras package (the Tweaker's Dream) which I highly recommend, as well as a clearly printed color manual! I am a very frugal person and I have found this telescope to be of great value. I have so far been able to see M31 (the Andromeda Galaxy) in detail, the Great Nebula in Orion, a transit (shadow) of one of Jupiter's moon's on the planet, the cloud bands and Great Red Spot on Jupiter (with the 9mm and a 2x barlow), the list goes on.
My experience with Rex has been top notch, he is a great guy who stands up for his customers and communicates every step of the way. I had a minor issue with a pair of Celestron binoculars I purchased along with the scope (Celestron's fault Not Opticsmart's), and he was helpful with exchanging them every step of the way and made the process very smooth. He is a business owner who is willing to go the extra mile for his customers!
I can recommend the Apertura 2X Barlow lens as a great first accessory for this telescope, it will give you effectively another 2 eyepieces because it doubles the magnification of the two that are included.
My experience level is I have spent about a year looking at the night sky through binoculars, and this is my first telescope purchase.
Happy Observing!
- Enjoying our first telescope
- I ordered the AD8 for our family to enjoy. We are doing exactly that. Our order included a 2x Barlow, a Telrad, and the "tweekers" package. All pieces arrived on time and in good packing condition. I was able to follow the included instructions and had the dob assembled in just over an hour. As a complete newbie, I was glad to see this was not difficult at all. I used the laser collimator to align the mirrors. This was fairly straight forward since the secondary mirror arrived in correct alignment. We have used the scope a couple of times and are thoroughly enjoying gazing at stars from our back yard. Thank you, David Giles, for your quick response to emails and helpful approach to our transaction.

Sous-Vide 101: Slow-Cooked City Ham With Balsamic Brown Sugar Glaze
Sous-Vide 101 is our series of posts with recipes, tips, and techniques on sous-vide cookery.
[Photographs: J. Kenji Lopez..
Step 1: Start With a Good Ham
Hams come in various levels of quality, ranging from chopped-and-formed giant Spam-like creations, to actual whole muscle-cured and cooked cuts. The latter is what you're after. Once you move into the whole muscle realm, even the standard supermarket option (Cook's brand is the most popular) will do, but you can move into the realm of specialty hams,
Since city hams come pre-cooked, for 3 hours to guarantee that they're piping hot through to the center.
Step 3: Make the Glaze oven is ideal.
Step 5: Give it the First Coat
Like painting a wall, the best way to build up a good, even coat of glaze is to work in layers. Start by painting one layer on before popping the ham into the preheated oven.
Step 6: Repeat Glaze
Continue brushing the ham with fresh glaze every five minutes for a total of three or four coats. When the ham is shiny and shellacked all over, you're done.
Step 7: Get REady to Carve
I'm a fan of practicality in the kitchen, which means that I'd rather serve my ham pre-sliced and ready to eat than to fumble around at the dining room table trying to serve it. Here's the easiest way I know to slice a bone-in ham.
Step 8: Make the First Cut
It can be rather impressive to make lots of thin, parallel cuts towards
Serve up that ham with some good wine, a big-a$s fork, and extra glaze tables.This is the official HP iPAQ Voice Messenger User Guide in English provided from the manufacturer. If you are looking for detailed technical specifications, please see our Specs page.

Hello, in continuing the question portion of the webinar titled "How much should a website cost?" I have a question about using a web browser for having staff maintain the site. Is there something we would need to ask our web developer to add on the backend for using a web broswer managment system? There was mention of using Dreamweaver, but after hearing Gunner's opinion about Dreamweaver, I would like to transition into a modern CMS. What should we tell our web developer when going with a modern CMS like WordPress, Drupal, etc.?
Thank you!!!
How do you know when you have "custom code development" and is this an area where you can reduce costs by trying to use/adapt open source software? My organization has a database of information that we want to make available in a variety of ways (different search models), and probably extend in the future, possibly even integrating with other websites. Is this in the realm of "custom code development" and if so, how avoidable is it ?
This was fantastic - thanks so much. I'm a dinosaur who learned HTML in the 1990s (when pages were gray), and I'd like Mr. Gunn to elaborate on the geeky reasoning behind the uselessness and danger of using Dreamweaver for content management. I totally agree, but it would help in my own efforts to transition away from this stuff to have an expert opinion and more detail.
I'd also like to know what you guys think about eCRM ASPs like Convio. You can contact me offline at colnick@laconservancy.org
Thanks!

Built-in browser management solutions come standard in most CMSs. I've heard complaints about Drupal's lack of differentiation between the admin and user interface causing confusion, but I've not experienced this myself. In terms of what you should tell a developer, this is dictated by what kind of site would best serve your organization, and this takes planning and research. TechSoup has a lot of great articles to help you get started. Here's the "Web Building" link from the TechSoup Learning Center:
This depends on the size, form, and state of your current database (is it clean? compatible? large or small?), what exactly you're looking to achieve as an end product(s), and how important this functionality is to your overall website goals. Database migration rarely happens in absence of at least a few hiccups. Typically the functionality your describing is not something that's provided out-of-the-box, and is therefore designated as custom.
This was a very helpful session, thank you. I am wondering about building a website that is not a brochure site, that is more of a web application, custom code site where both Joomla and Drupal may not quite fit our needs, what would you suggest in this case? Thank you!
I have two comments:
1) If you have specific questions on this topic, I suggest you do not post them here if you want an answer. Questions are stacking up causing confusion, and most people won't see your questions posted under this thread or topic. Create a new topic and ask your question as clearly as possible. Also include as much information that can help people answer your question. Most of the questions here would be best addresses by a meeting with a web designer or Internet consultant, not a short answer on a forum. The topics are complex and should be as specific as possible so you can get a useful answer.
2) Someone mentioned that there was a statement the "uselessness and danger of using Dreamweaver". While there may be some situations where this could be true, Dreamweaver is one of many professional web design tools and so those that find it "useless" may be in a unique situation that has nothing to do with web design, and since it is a web design tool the only time I can think were it could be "dangerous" would be creating web pages with content that made someone more than just a little angry.
I've been using DreamWeaver for about 8 years and I can't say I have every been hurt or even brused by it once. I can't say the same for Windows usage, which continues to cause periodic injury and humiliation.

Re: Dreamweaver
It's a very useful tool in many situations, but a bit bulky for the CMS world. As was mentioned in the presentation DW can be great for the design side of CMS, but in terms of implementation it's irrelevant for some aspects and overkill for others. With CMS you're either adding content directly through the browser (no need for DW), or modifying the site design/infrastructure by editing CSS, text, and php docs that don't render in DW's design view. Firebug is a Firefox add-on that's great for previewing site modifications with your browser in real time. Once you've mapped out changes in Firebug, it's convenient to implement edits with a light-weight color-coded text editor. DW can be used for this. It's somewhat a matter of preference, but why spend time loading DW when you can get the job done with a few smaller, faster programs?
That's a great set of questions.
You usually can't "bolt on" web-based content administration to a site that does not have it. So you would likely need to migrate to a CMS, but without knowing what technology your site is running on now, I can't give a super-useful response on that point.
There is *nothing* "wrong" with Dreamweaver, it's a great tool and I still use it in some situations.
It is simply the case that Dreamweaver-maintained "static" sites are largely a thing of the past, and moving to a web-based content management system provides a host of richer, more powerful web site capabilities, including RSS, "edit from anywhere", and rich multi-user editing, not to mention access to libraries of add-on functionality.
In terms of platform selection, that's a longer process, and that's what the webinar was about. Don't pick a technology first; have a plan for your web site and find a shop that has experience creating the kind of site you think you want. Make the use of an open source CMS like Wordpress, Drupal, Joomla or Plone be a requirement of your implementation when you ask for a quote.
That said, Wordpress is an *excellent* entry-level CMS for small to medium-size organizational web needs. The others are "bigger" platforms, more powerful but correspondingly more complicated.
What you describe is indeed in the realm of custom code development, and that's not a bad thing. :^) Anytime you make a unique data model available to the world via the web, you have to create a solution that understands how to manage that resource.
For the purposes of the this webinar and these answers, custom code is functionality distinct from the general CMS tasks of managing text and other media, including "create new page", "edit page", "add navigation link", etc. By putting together lists of "user stories" as described on the webinar, you can separate them into "general content management features" vs site-specific functionality.
The key factor in keeping down custom coding costs is not starting to code until you *really* understand what you're building it and have vetted it thoroughly with target users. Understand exactly who you are building your site for, and know exactly what kinds of steps they should be able to take on the site to obtain benefit or useful information. These "user stories" form the basis for getting an estimate on the cost of the coding project.
In addition, such user stories also let you investigate whether there are existing solutions or partial solutions available. Writing custom web code as a nonprofit is always something you should do as a last resort. If you can find a data visualization library or other platform that meets your needs for publishing your data, I strongly recommend leaning toward existing solutions if at all possible. Code you pay to have written is a stone around your organizational ankle that you'll drag forward with you. Sometimes that's the right thing to do, but only occasionally.
A related issue is integration with your existing or future "main" site; it's not a given that your CMS and a solution like the one described above will interoperate seamlessly. Definitely verify the status of such issues before starting to code your data model.
See my "custom code" answer elsewhere on this page :)
As I mentioned in another answer:
Thank you for that reply. Could you refer me to examples of "data visualization libraries" ? Thanks.
Unfortunately the data visualization space is not one that we actively track, so I don't have any good recommendations off the top of my head.
Factors to consider when looking at such libraries include:
1) compatibility with existing technology that will need to be integrated (possibly your web site, and any software that generates/manages the data you want to visualize, any other subsystems required to publish the data you want to visualize).
2) Licensing and costs; if there are respectable open source options, those are worth trying, as it's best to avoid being locked into licensed libraries that have annual or usage-based fees. If you have to license, look for 1-time license models as opposed to recurring.
3) Administrative tools: how does the system let you "drive" it? Are there web-based admin screens, or do you have to hand-edit configuration files in a text editor? Again, understand and document how you plan to and need to be able to manage the tool and the visualization offereings (e.g. how do you create/add a new visualization, how to you list all available visualizations, can users create their own visualizations, can users save custom visualizations in an account, etc) before looking at what's available.
4) Use by others "like you": do you know of peer organizations or others in your network doing similar visualizations? What are they using?
That said, I did a quick Google search, and there seems to be a wealth of options. You'll likely need someone somewhat technical to go over the options, as they span a range of languages, underlying platforms, and architectural models (e.g. client-side vs server side):
In addition, if you've seen visualizations on the web that you liked, follow up and see if there's contact information on the site where you can inquire what they're using and whether or not it's generally available.
BUT FIRST, before looking at that link or considering any solution, write down your requirements: what should the technology allow you, the data publisher, to do, and what should it enable a person browsing the data to do? If you don't take the time to wrestle with and explicitly record your needs in detail, it's odds-on you won't get it right. Sorry to be pushy, but that's a fact in my many years of experience and mistake-making :^)- $154 shopbop.comSimilar itemA cluster of Swarovski crystal sparkles on these Ben Amun earrings.

Abstract
ARAUJO NETO, Sebastião Elviro de et al. Organic production of seedlings of sweet pepper with different substrates. Cienc. Rural [online]. 2009, vol.39, n.5, pp. 1408-1413. Epub May 22, 2009. ISSN 0103-8478..
The seedling's stage in the horticulture is fundamental to obtain good yield, and the substrate is the largest responsible for that. The objective of this research was to identify combination of organic residues in the confection of substrates for production of sweet pipper seedlings cv. Casca Dura Avelar. Seeds were sowed in plastic glasses of 180cm3, containing mixtures of organic residues in each substrate, as it follows: T1 Plantimax® (treatment control), T2 compost organic + coconut peel (1:1 v/v), T3 compost organic + bed-of-chicken + peel-of-rice carbonized (1:1:1 v/v), T4 compost organic + manure bovine + peel-of-rice carbonized (1:1:1 v/v), T5 compost organic + earthworm casting + peel-of-rice carbonized (1:1:1 v/v), T6 compost organic + earthworm casting + pit of triturated açaí (1:1:1 v/v), T7 compost organic + earthworm casting + peel of triturated coconut (1:1:1 v/v), T8 compost organic + manure bovine + peel of triturated coconut (1:1:1 v/v). The experiment followed a completely randomized design with eigth treatments and four replicates and three plants per plot. There was effect of the substrate in the production of seedlings of sweet pepper for all the analyzed characteristics. The substrate Plantmax® was what presented better acting. Among the alternative substrates, the T5 was what presented the best result.

These arched brushes will be approximately 4" wide (brushes themselves) and will use the yellow and black attention getting color scheme shown on the right illustration.
The left brush assembly indicates how brush systems will be used to seal in certain areas around the enclosure.
The brush example on the right is the same type of brush that will be used at the bottom of the 30-foot long skirts that run both inside and outside the rail system, hanging off the bottom of the main arch. There will be two sets of these brushes on either side of the knee wall, helping to keep dust, blowing snow and rain, some insects and wildlife out.realmagick.com The shrine of knowledge.

To do this, simply click one time on your table to select it and then click on the column that you want to have your data sorted by. In this case, I'm going to click on the Complete Tour column so that all of my data can be sorted by the cheapest to the most expensive tour. I'll then come over to my Table Inspector and in the Edit Rows & Columns, I'll click the Gear icon and then select Sort Ascending.
You'll see that all of the data in my table is automatically resorted based on the values in this last column, and they're sorted from the least to the most expensive. If I want to choose to have my table sorted by a different column, all I need to do is click on the column header for that column, go back over to my Edit Rows & Columns tool, and select Sort by Ascending there. And now my table is in alphabetical order based on the name of the tour package itself.

The bill proposes freeing ISPs from liability when they report suspected cybercrime, such as an e-mailed bomb threat that crosses their network, assuming they act in good faith. It also calls for strengthened penalties for cybercrime and increased funding for a government-run centre to detect security threats.
"Until we secure our cyber infrastructure, a few keystrokes and an Internet connection is all one needs to disable the economy or endanger lives," Smith, who is chairman of the House Subcommittee on Crime, said. "We cannot afford to let our technology be our weakness," he added.
The bill has not been scheduled for a vote by the full Judiciary committee yet, although Smith's spokesman said he expects the full committee to consider it in the coming weeks.We're 987 Writers

The Cialis were so good, in fact, that I my second order with them was for 60 more 20mg generics.
To be honest, I went there hoping they would carry Pronabol (an Indian version of Dianabol that is the closest thing to the original Ciba brand ones I've ever used), but like everyone else, they only carry Anabol, and odds are any Anabol you don't buy in Thailand is fake - It's notoriously hard to get out of the country. I've had a couple of real tubs over the last couple of years...one from Shaz, and one from a British Ex-Pat who actually lives in Thailand and is famous for creating paper anabolics.
Anyway, here they are, knock yourselves out -- I've confirmed that they do in fact deliver what they promise, but sadly from India, not from the land of the rising Sun.
GENERIC MEDICINE - Order at Nippon PharmacyBooks of The Times Murdoch in London
By Christopher Lehmann-Haupt
Published: January 2, 1984
GOOD TIMES, BAD TIMES. By Harold
Evans. 430 pages. Illustrated. Atheneum. $17.95. The ''Good Times'' of Harold Evans's title came before Rupert Murdoch acquired The Times and The Sunday Times of London in 1981. The ''Bad Times'' came after. It's about as simple as that.
The good times involved editing The Sunday Times from 1967 until 1981. There was the successful publication of extracts from the diaries of former Labor Minister Richard Crossman, an act undertaken to challenge Britain's clandestine method of governing and expose its ''record of bad decisions secretly arrived at.''
There were the campaigns to expose the real dimensions of Kim Philby's espionage activities and the lie that lay behind the 1974 crash of a DC- 10 airliner outside Paris and the liability of the distributors of the drug Thalidomide. Such milestones of investigative journalism were achieved, according to Mr. Evans, through the unfailing support of publisher Roy Thomson, whose ''creed,'' printed on a card he carried in his pocket for 25 years, read in part, ''I do not believe that a newspaper can be run properly unless its editorial columns are run freely and independently by a highly skilled and dedicated professional journalist.''
But then came trouble with the print unions, the shutdown of the papers, the decision of the Thomson Organization to pull out and finally, with charming humility and many a promise to preserve the integrity and independence of The Times, the takeover by Rupert Murdoch, the Australian press baron. Although Mr. Evans was warned that by offering him the editorship of The Times, Mr. Murdoch was merely removing him from his base of power at The Sunday Times and that, as one colleague warned Mr. Evans, ''It'll all end in tears,'' he could not turn down the chance to run Britain's highly prestigious and history-encrusted newspaper of record.
Sure enough, although Mr. Evans was free long enough to make important changes in the paper and thereby reverse its precipitous circulation decline, Mr. Murdoch began to stalk him in ever-tightening circles. ''He was incontinent in breach of promise,'' Mr. Evans writes. Although the new owner had signed guarantees to keep his hands off, he could not resist giving editorial advice. He scoffed at Mr. Evans's extensive coverage of Poland's Solidarity movement, citing a paragraph in one of his tabloids as all the coverage the story deserved. He refused to give Mr. Evans a budget, encouraged him to spend whatever was necessary to improve the paper, then indicted him for being a spendthrift.
Finally, his guerrilla campaign fully mounted, Mr. Murdoch asked for Mr. Evans's resignation. Although the editor had the backing of an independent Board of Directors, he was exhausted and could see no good for the paper in his continuing. Just as another friend had predicted, he had lasted no longer than 12 months. They were bad times.
Harry Evans's account of these times reminds one of nothing so much as a highly English version of ''Indecent Exposure,'' David McClintick's account of the struggle for control of Columbia Pictures Industries. Once again, it's a bully in power against a subordinate of deep integrity. Once again, the cast is filled with characters you love to hate - not only Mr. Murdoch, whom Mr. Evans compares to ''the philanderer who convinces each new girl that she's the one who'll change him'' - but also people like Mr. Evans's deputy editor and eventual successor, the aristocratically laconic Charles Douglas- Home, who, according to this account, conspired against Mr. Evans while affecting to be his loyal deputy and, when finally confronted, said, ''I would do anything to edit The Times. Wouldn't you?''
Finally, like ''Indecent Exposure,'' ''Good Times, Bad Times'' is told from the innocent victim's point of view. In fact, it goes even further, since Mr. Evans, unlike Mr. McClintick, can never even pretend to be getting the other side's version of the story. This is the book's one outstanding weakness. For all the grace of its prose and the wit of its storytelling, it ends up seeming to protest too much. For all the integrity it manifests and all the love of honest journalism it flaunts on its sleeve, it leaves one with the sense that Mr. Evans is serving his own cause even more fervently than that of honest journalism.
The biggest problem is that he never comes up with a fully satisfying explanation for why the new proprietor of The Times was out to get him. He offers politics as a possible reason; Mr. Murdoch may have grown too unhappy with The Times's sniping at the Thatcher Government's economic policy. But in the light of Mr. Murdoch's apparent opportunism and lack of deep political conviction, this explanation seems lackluster. It only serves to heighten the sense of Rupert Murdoch as a character of motiveless malignity, a kind of Iago. Such people are fascinating. Iago happens to be the most interesting character in Shakespeare's ''Othello.'' Unfortunately for Mr. Evans, Rupert Murdoch is the most interesting character in ''Good Times, Bad Times.'' Considering the author's almost excessive piety about what constitutes good and evil in contemporary journalism, I doubt that this is quite the impression with which he meant to leave us.

A healthy green and uniform lawn is tough to get established, and unfortunately, incredibly easy to destroy. Heavy foot traffic, wheelbarrows and gardening equipment, and car tires can shred your grass to pieces, and in areas where traffic is constant, it can be impossible to reseed. Turf reinforcement mesh creates traction and distributes the weight of people and equipment passing over the lawn, so feet and tires aren’t yanking grass out in clumps. It can also spare vehicles from becoming stuck and people from slipping and sliding when the grass is wet.‹ Back to Lombard surname

.”
Special report: borderforce.azcentral.com
Two years ago, members of Congress called on Homeland Security’s Office of Inspector General to investigate CBP’s use of force after a PBS documentary aired cell-phoneyear after the OIG report that agents would continue to consider rocks deadly weapons justifying the use of deadly force.
Shawn Moran, vice president of the National Border Patrol Council, called PERF’s criticisms “a misinterpretation of the situations in which agents used deadly force.” He said Fisher’s directive amounts to “a reminder to agents to seek alternatives. We don’t view it as an outright restriction on agents’ use of deadly force.”
The Twitter account for the Border Patrol union tweeted, just after the guidelines were released, that “Border Patrol agents must not hesitate to defend themselves when being attacked.”
Fisher said that CBP is “in the final stages” of updating its use-of-force handbook, and that it will begin negotiations with its unions have been killed in rocking assaults.
In a statement accompanying the directive, Fisher said that since 2010 agents have used deadly force 43 times, resulting in 10 deaths. However, data compiled by The Republic records 26 deaths involving agents since 2010. Two of those involved CBP officers. CBP didn’t immediately respond to requests for clarification.
Rep. Raul Grijalva, D-Ariz., was one of the members of Congress who called for the OIG investigation. He called Fisher’s directive and the release of the policy “a first step, and a recognition of the fact that this is a matter of growing public importance.” But he added that CBP and the Border Patrol, as the nation’s largest law-enforcement body, “should follow the same requirements for transparency and accountability that other federal agencies and police forces have to follow.”
U.S. Sen. Jeff Flake, R-Arizona, issued a statement that said, “The Border Patrol has a tough job. Any loss of life incurred in the course of Border Patrol duties, as with any other government agency, should be given a close look.”
Chris Rickerd, policy counsel for the ACLU in Washington, D.C, said the policy change is not enough.
“It is largely a restatement of existing policy, which is a shame because clearly existing policy isn’t working,” he said
He said the Police Executive Research Forum recommendations must be released and called for an independent investigation of every use of force case in the last.”There is damage that has been done; there is repair that must be done.
A cripple in the street
A blind man in the corner
Hospitals loaded with the sick
Morgues full of preserved bodies
A body without its head
A plane in the air, but no pilot
Wrists slit, the blood gushing
Neck dangling from a hangman’s noose
A mother wailing
A father crying
A daughter weeping for her parents
A groom mourning his most recent bride
A disease spreading
A darkness growing
A vast expanse of barren land
Pungent heralds of a dying world
A drop of sunshine
A ray of light
A breeze with moisture
A blade of grass pushing through the sun-baked earth
A note of music
A spray of rain
A splash of color
Youth coming into a rugged age
A smile on a face
The laughter of a child
A rainbow; a silver lining
A trumpet answering a distress call
A mother conceiving
Daddy coming back home
A helping hand
A pleading message: Heal me.

Jil Sander’s tweed jacket is a sublime cut and great fabric and it’s reduced to £415 at Browns, but if that’s still too dear for you then forego the high street for a quality secondhand jacket. You’ll have to try on a good few examples until you find the correct fit and maybe enlist the help of a tailor or sew-savvy friend to make some adjustments but you can snap up a great piece like Rokit’s blue-grey jacket for only £25 and you can guarantee the fabric will be top notch.
A little tip, always check the fit from the shoulder, it’s the most complex part of a jacket, and the most difficult area to change. If the shoulders sit properly then after adjusting the sleeves or waist you should be able to get a perfect fit.
All Saints’ Jack waistcoat is reduced to a very reasonable £35 and will keep you toasty, alternatively hunt out some vintage long-sleeve Fair Isle knits if you really feel the cold. Perk up the look with a coloured tie in a muted but rich tone like burgundy or forest green to liven up the greys, add a thick scarf, gloves, a hat or even a balaclava if it’s particularly icy and you’re all set to brave the outdoors.

Israel, it appears, has a new neighbor – Osama Bin Laden.
In a lecture at Tel Aviv University, Major-General Aharon Zeevi Farkash, the head of Israel’s Military Intelligence, confirmed that Al-Qaeda has now established a presence in Gaza in the wake of the Israeli withdrawal from the area.
You’ll recall that in the immediate aftermath of Israel’s retreat, there was chaos along Gaza’s southern boundary with Egypt, as thousands of people moved freely in both directions without anyone there to check them.
As a result, analysts feared that terrorists would exploit the opening to move men and equipment into Gaza for possible use in future attacks against the Jewish state.
Now, Maj.-Gen. Farkash has confirmed precisely that.
I don't want to beat my own drum here, but in a post back on July 24th, several weeks before the Gaza pullout, I wrote the following:
.
…however difficult it might appear to be to maintain an Israeli presence in Gaza, the consequences of withdrawal might only prove far more devastating – and lethal.”
So now, as a result of Prime Minister Ariel Sharon’s abandonment of Gaza, the people of Israel have yet another terrorist group poised next door to worry about.
Nice going, Arik.SOUND TRANSIT
Has the tide turned for Sound Transit? The agency's light-rail plan was looking pretty unstoppable Monday, when agency and federal bigwigs gathered to report that the Bush administration had included in its 2004 budget $75 million of a proposed $500 million grant and had given its highest stamp of approval to the proposed 14-mile starter line from downtown Seattle to Tukwila. The "highly recommended" rating was based on projected ridership, design, and the level of local funding that will go into the project. "We're as close as we have ever been, in terms of not just receiving the funding agreement but also our state of project readiness," says agency director Joni Earl. "The minute we get that grant agreement, we literally are under construction in three weeks." The ticking clock has made time a critical issue for light-rail opponents, and they're doing everything they can to stop the project from Olympia. A bill to force a revote on light rail—and possibly replace it with monorail or another technology—is in the Senate's Highways and Transportation Committee, headed by Eastside Republican Jim Horn. (The bill is sponsored by a whole herd of Eastside Republicans, though Horn is not among them.) Another bill to replace the agency's 18-member board with an elected body (and, incidentally, jeopardize Sound Transit's federal funding by leaving the agency in limbo until an election can be held in November) is in the same committee. A companion bill was expected to be filed by Seattle Democratic Rep. Ed Murray on Wednesday, according to Murray's office. The bill "creates a whole new level of uncertainty" for the agency's goal of securing the grant by summer, Earl says.
HIGHER EDUCATION
At the end of November, the regents of both Washington State University and the University of Washington issued the state Legislature a kinda- sorta-ultimatum: Start bringing state per-student support in line with the actual costs of educating them, or we're going to limit admissions. Cut education funding, and expect to see a smaller student body—just when demand for higher education is about to skyrocket. The resolution wasn't just a fluke; in January, the presidents of both universities issued an unprecedented joint letter asking alums to help spread the message: more state funding for higher education. Though state budgeters claim the Legislature has the final say on how many students will be admitted in any year, the regents' resolution signaled a level of resistance to legislative fiat not seen in a decade or more.
MEDIA
The Washington Post is set to open a Seattle bureau this fall, according to Bill Hamilton, an associate managing editor at the D.C. paper. It will be staffed by Washington state native Blaine Harden, one of many reporters leaving The New York Times in frustration over new executive editor Howell Raines. Harden is also a former Post reporter and will focus on environment and land-use issues.
In a major coup, the Seattle Post-Intelligencer reeled in Mark Trahant as its new editorial-page editor; he's previously worked for both the P-I and The Seattle Times and has been a Pulitzer finalist. Trahant replaces Joann Byrd, who is retiring.

What you want is the densities (mass per unit volume) of copper and zinc. Metal densites are readily available in chem and physics handbooks and online.
For example, try
Here is a site that gives composition and mass by year for the penny.
You can find the density of each at and click on copper (#29) and zinc (#30). The density of Zn is a little lower than that of copper and you can see that the penny changed to a lower mass with the new 97.5/2.5 Cu/Zn blend. The atomic mass of zinc is slightly higher than that of copper which means that a mole of Cu atoms weighs slightly less than a mole of Zn atoms.
My ratio above might be misinterpreted. Perhaps I sould have written 97.5%Zn/2.5% Cu.Relevant offers
The man charged with injuring cricketer Jesse Ryder in an alleged assault at a Christchurch bar 10 months ago is seeking to have the case dropped because of pre-trial publicity.
The stay application was heard by Judge Brian Callaghan in the Christchurch District Court today.
The man has name suppression and Judge Callaghan ordered that the stay application be argued in chambers, in the presence of only the people involved in the case and the media.
He suppressed reporting of all the submissions and evidence heard at the hearing, except for the nature of the application and the outcome.
The 38-year-old defendant was present for the hearing. He faces a charge of injuring Ryder with reckless disregard for his safety. Last year he elected trial by jury and the case has been progressing through the pre-trial process.
The hearing is continuing.

Objective
To examine whether sedentary behavior, obesity, smoking, and depression are risk factors for persistent fatigue in adolescents.
Design
Longitudinal population-based survey.
Setting
Twenty-eight randomly selected schools in east London, England, in 2001 and 2003.
Participants
A total of 1880 adolescents (49% male; 81% nonwhite British) aged 11 to 12 years and 13 to 14 years in 2000.
Intervention
Confidential questionnaires completed in class.
Main Outcome Measures
Persistent fatigue (extreme tiredness twice weekly or more often in the previous month at both surveys), sedentary behavior, physical activity, depressive symptoms, body mass index, and smoking.
Results
Severe fatigue was reported in 11% of participants aged 11 to 14 years and 17% of participants aged 13 to 16 years. Eighty-four participants (4%) reported persistent fatigue. Across both surveys, only 3 pupils reported chronic fatigue syndrome. In multivariate logistic regression, risk of persistent fatigue was independently associated with being sedentary for more than 4 hours per day (odds ratio = 1.6; 95% confidence interval, 1.1-2.3; P = .01), being physically active (odds ratio = 1.5; 95% confidence interval, 1.1-2.3; P = .004), and depressive symptoms (odds ratio = 2.0; 95% confidence interval, 1.5-2.7; P < .001) in the first survey, after adjustment for age, sex, and socioeconomic status. Obesity and smoking were not associated with fatigue.
Conclusions
Persistent fatigue is common. Being highly sedentary or highly active independently increased the risk of persistent fatigue, suggesting that divergence in either direction from healthy levels of activity increases the risk for persistent fatigue. Mental health is important in the etiology of persistent fatigue. To help define effective preventive strategies, further work is needed on the mechanisms by which these factors contribute to fatigue.
Fatigue is a common symptom in modern adolescent populations; contemporary data suggest that severe morning fatigue at least once per week is reported in early adolescence by 40% to 60% of European adolescents1 and 30.6% of US girls.2 A detailed recent Dutch study3 found that 20.5% of adolescent girls and 6.5% of boys report severe fatigue at a clinical level in the previous fortnight. While fatigue itself may be a normal feature of the increased growth and educational demands of adolescence, persistent fatigue syndromes are an increasing concern and one of the major causes of long-term school absence.4 In a recent United Kingdom (UK) population-based sample of individuals aged 11 to 15 years,5 0.6% reported severe fatigue lasting longer than 6 months and 0.19% had chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS) as defined operationally by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention criteria.6
Despite the prevalence of fatigue and persistent fatigue states in young people, little is known of factors associated with severe symptomatic fatigue and persistent fatigue in adolescents. In cross-sectional studies, severe symptomatic fatigue in young people has been reported to be associated with other somatic symptoms,2 sleep problems,7 depression and anxiety,3 and alcohol and tobacco use.2,7 However, to our knowledge, these associations have not been examined in longitudinal studies and may represent outcomes of fatigue rather than risk factors.
Being sedentary in childhood has recently been identified as a potential risk factor for chronic fatigue in adult life.8 There is cross-sectional evidence in adults that severe symptomatic fatigue is associated with physical inactivity.9 However, the associations between physical exercise, sedentary behaviors, psychological problems, and severe or persistent fatigue have been little studied in young people. A better understanding of such factors might inform preventive strategies to reduce the incidence of persistent fatigue states in adolescence.
The extent to which risk factors for symptomatic fatigue may also be associated with operationally defined fatigue syndromes such as CFS in adolescents is also unclear. Studies in adults suggest that there is considerable overlap between chronic symptomatic fatigue and CFS10 and that persistent symptomatic fatigue may be a precursor of CFS.11 A recent study12 in Dutch adolescents similarly suggested that there is a continuum of symptoms of fatigue from healthy adolescents to those with CFS. Additionally, the potential for overlap between symptomatic fatigue and CFS has recently been increased by a move away from using operational criteria to define CFS in Europe; the Royal College of Paediatrics and Child Health in the UK has suggested CFS be defined simply as 3 or more months of medically unexplained debilitating fatigue.4
We used longitudinal data from a population-based sample of UK adolescents to examine the hypotheses that higher levels of sedentary behavior, obesity, smoking, and depression increase the risk for later persistent fatigue.
The Research With East London Adolescents Community Health Survey study is a longitudinal school-based survey of a representative sample of young people in east London, England.13 In 2001, 30 of the 42 secondary schools in east London were randomly selected and balanced to ensure representation of single- and mixed-sex schools. In the 28 schools that agreed to participate in phase 1 (2001), 2 representative mixed-ability classes were selected from each of year 7 and year 9 and data were collected from 2790 young people aged 11 to 14 years (84% response rate). Phase 2 resurveyed classes involved in phase 1 in 2003 when the young people were aged 13 to 16 years (years 9 and 11). The total sample size for phase 2 was 2675 participants (78% response rate), of whom 2094 had participated in phase 1. Ethical approval was obtained from the North East London Research Ethics Committee. Written consent was obtained from all of the pupils.
Data were collected by confidential questionnaires completed in class. Questionnaires have been shown to be the most reliable method of collecting activity data from large adolescent samples.14 Questions on fatigue were modified from the World Health Organization Health Behaviour in School-aged Children survey questions on subjective symptoms.1 Young people were asked, “In the last month, how often have you had the following: headache, stomachache, back pain, other aches and pains, and extreme tiredness?” Response options were rarely or never, about once a month, about weekly, more than once a week, and about daily. We defined severe fatigue as extreme tiredness occurring more than once per week, in line with Health Behaviour in School-aged Children study usage for significant subjective symptoms in young people.15 Persistent fatigue was defined as severe fatigue in both phases. Young people were also asked whether they currently had CFS.
We used 2 Health Behaviour in School-aged Children study activity questions that have been shown to be valid and reliable in individuals aged 12 to 15 years.16 The frequency question asked, “Outside school hours, how often each week do you usually exercise in your free time, so much that you get out of breath or sweat?” with responses from once a month or less to every day. The duration question asked, “Outside school hours, how many hours do you usually exercise in your free time, so much that you get out of breath or sweat?” with responses ranging from 0 to 7 or more hours per week. Following the recommendations by Booth et al,16 we defined adolescents as active if they exercised more than twice a week for an hour or more, with the remainder defined as inactive.
The quantification of inactivity has received little attention. We used a modified version of the Health Behaviour in School-aged Children study activity duration question to obtain data on sedentary behaviors, asking, “Outside school hours, on average, how many hours a day do you usually watch TV or videos, play video games, or play on the computer?” We categorized sedentary behavior as less than 2 hours, 2 to 4 hours, and more than 4 hours per day.
Depressive symptoms were assessed using the reliable Short Moods and Feelings Questionnaire with thresholds for high scorers from validation studies.17 Long-standing illness was assessed using a question from the Health Survey for England, and smoking was assessed using standard Office for National Statistics questions. Height (Leicester portable stadiometer; CMS Camden Ltd, London) and weight (Tanita Body Fat 300 electronic scales; Tanita Corp, Tokyo, Japan) were measured by trained researchers, and body mass index (calculated as weight in kilograms divided by height in meters squared) z scores were calculated from the UK growth reference. Body mass index z scores were categorized as underweight (≤ −1.00), normal (−0.99 to 0.99), overweight (1.00 to 1.99), and obese (≥ 2.00, corresponding to body mass index ≥ 98th percentile).
Ethnicity was reported using an adaptation of the UK Census 2001 questions; 73% of the phase 1 sample was nonwhite. For socioeconomic data, household crowding (> 1.5 persons per room) and country of birth were reported by young people, with eligibility for free school meals obtained from Local Education Authorities.
Analyses were weighted to take account of unequal probabilities of selection. As the sample selection used a stratified cluster design with pupils clustered within schools, standard errors and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for means and proportions were calculated using the survey commands in Stata version 8 statistical software (Stata Corp, College Station, Texas). Logistic regression was used to examine associations between potential predictor variables in phase 1 and each of severe fatigue in phase 2 and persistent fatigue. Associations were first adjusted for socioeconomic status, sex, and school year. Multivariate models were then developed, including all predictor factors together with socioeconomic status, sex, and school year. We also included country of birth in the models because of the ethnic diversity of our sample.
Data on fatigue in both phases were available for 1880 participants (49% male; 90% of the total longitudinal sample), who form the subject of all of the report analyses. The distribution of ethnicity in this population was white British in 19%, white other in 5%, Bangladeshi in 27%, Asian Indian in 10%, Pakistani in 7%, black Caribbean in 6%, black African in 10%, black British in 5%, mixed ethnicity in 7%, and Chinese, Vietnamese, or other in 5%, very similar to that in the entire longitudinal sample.
Table 1 shows the distribution of severe fatigue in the sample in both phases. Severe fatigue increased from 219 participants (11%; 95% CI, 10%-13%) in phase 1 to 305 participants (17%; 95% CI, 15%-18%) in phase 2 (P < .001). Eighty-four (38%) of the students reporting severe fatigue at phase 1 also reported severe fatigue at phase 2; thus, 4% of the students reported persistent fatigue. Ethnicity was not associated with frequency of fatigue in either phase. Chronic fatigue syndrome was reported by 2 subjects (0.07%) in phase 1, neither of whom participated in phase 2, and by an additional subject in phase 2.
Among the participants, 367 (20%; 95% CI, 18%-22%) were born outside the UK. Those born outside the UK had a trend toward lower prevalence of severe fatigue in phase 1 (15%; 95% CI, 11%-21%) compared with those born in the UK (20%; 95% CI, 19%-23%) (P = .08) and a lower prevalence in phase 2 (those born outside the UK: 15%; 95% CI, 12%-20%; those born in the UK: 21%; 95% CI, 19%-23%) (P = .03). Those born outside the UK also had a trend toward lower prevalence of persistent fatigue (3%; 95% CI, 2%-5%) compared with those born in the UK (5%; 95% CI, 4%-6%) (P = .07).
Sedentary behavior and activity were associated in both phases. In phase 1, 23% (95% CI, 21%-26%) of active young people were sedentary for more than 4 hours per day compared with 30% (95% CI, 27%-33%) of inactive young people (P = .007). In phase 2, 23% (95% CI, 20%-26%) of active young people and 33% (95% CI, 30%-36%) of inactive young people were sedentary for more than 4 hours per day (P < .001).
Table 2 shows the distribution of fatigue in both phases in relation to potential risk factors in phase 1. Table 3 shows associations between phase 1 factors and severe fatigue in phase 2. The sample size for the multivariate model adjusted for all factors was 1597 owing to missing data for some variables, particularly for body mass index. In the multivariate model adjusted for all factors, increased risk of severe fatigue in phase 2 was independently associated with sedentary behavior for more than 4 hours per day, being physically active, depressive symptoms, and having a long-standing condition at phase 1. Female sex was also associated with an increased risk, whereas birth outside the UK was associated with reduced risk. There was no significant interaction between sedentary behavior and physical activity. Odds ratios in the multivariate model were not materially changed when the frequency of severe fatigue in phase 1 was added to the model (data not shown).
Table 4 shows associations between phase 1 factors and persistent fatigue. Similar to findings for severe fatigue, sedentary behavior for more than 4 hours per day, being physically active, depressive symptoms, and having a long-standing illness at phase 1 were associated with an increased risk of persistent fatigue. There was no significant interaction between sedentary behavior and physical activity in the model. The association of sedentary behavior with fatigue was similar in both active and inactive subjects. Sex was not an effect modifier of the association between sedentary behavior and fatigue.
To our knowledge, these are the first longitudinal data on risk factors for persistent fatigue in adolescents. Four or more hours per day of television, video, or computer use doubled the risk of persistent fatigue. Higher levels of physical activity and depressive symptoms also independently increased the risk of persistent fatigue. These findings were independent of potential confounding factors, including socioeconomic status, body mass index, and having a chronic illness. Notably, the association between sedentary activities and later severe fatigue was also independent of baseline fatigue, indicating that this association does not merely reflect inactivity due to initial fatigue.
We gathered data from a large, ethnically diverse, population-based sample of adolescents using validated questions. Analyses were controlled for factors potentially associated with the presence or reporting of fatigue. The models for severe fatigue and persistent fatigue were similar and robust.
Our study had a number of limitations. We defined persistent fatigue as reporting severe fatigue in the previous month on 2 occasions 2 years apart. We acknowledge that this may misclassify some subjects as we have no knowledge of fatigue between these occasions. However, this is likely to bias our findings toward underestimation of relationships. Many adolescents with CFS do not attend school regularly; thus, our findings will underestimate the prevalence of persistent fatigue states. Additionally, those who do attend regularly are likely to have less severe fatigue. Our assessment of fatigue was limited and we could not assess the extent to which fatigue disrupted daily life. Fatigue may be a symptom of depression or chronic illness; however, our models for persistent fatigue included both chronic illness and a validated measure of depression. Sedentary behaviors and physical activity were highly correlated. To account for this, we entered each of them separately into the models and tested for any interaction.
Our estimate that 25% of participants reported severe fatigue weekly or more often at ages 11 to 13 years is similar to that reported by the US National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health,18 which found that 15% of boys and 24% of girls aged 12 to 17 years had fatigue weekly or more often. Severe fatigue increased significantly with age.
We found that high levels of sedentary behavior and exercise were each independently predictive of persistent fatigue. We are unaware of published population data on the association of fatigue with sedentary behavior in adolescents. Our findings are consistent with those by Viner and Hotopf8 that being sedentary in late childhood increases the risk of later CFS, but they are also consistent with those of case-control evidence19 and concerns within patient groups that higher levels of exercise predispose to chronic fatigue states. However, our finding regarding exercise is contrary to a cross-sectional Dutch school-based study3 reporting that higher participation in sports reduced the risk of severe fatigue and a cross-sectional US study2 that found no association. These differences may reflect reverse causality in the cross-sectional studies in that fatigued adolescents were less likely to participate in sports. Additionally, our exercise variable included lifestyle activity as well as sports in contrast to the other studies. It is notable that our definition of being physically active (1 hour of exercise on ≥ 2 days per week) is roughly similar to the current recommendations for adolescents of the President's Council on Physical Fitness and Sports and the National Association for Sport and Physical Education: “teens should do at least 20 minutes of vigorous activity 3 days a week and 30 minutes of moderate activity 5 days a week.”20 This suggests that promotion of healthy levels of physical activity, while associated with a clear health benefit, may also increase fatigue in contemporary adolescents.
Our findings suggest that sedentary behavior and exercise may influence the development of fatigue in different ways. Inactivity may predispose to fatigue through cardiorespiratory and muscle deconditioning or through a lack of the beneficial effects of regular exercise on health.21 Conversely, high levels of exercise may produce fatigue through muscle fatigue or metabolic changes in the central nervous system.22 Our finding of independent effects for sedentary behavior and exercise is supported by evidence that sedentary behavior and physical activity, while correlated, have different determinants and track differentially from childhood.23 It is also consistent with recent reports that sedentary behavior and physical activity have independent effects on cardiovascular risk.24
These findings suggest that divergence in either direction from healthy, age-appropriate levels of activity increases the risk for persistent fatigue and that health promotion toward achieving healthy levels of activity in adolescence may prevent fatigue states. Our findings cannot necessarily be extrapolated to treatment for fatigue states but suggest that both prolonged rest and overexertion may increase rather than reduce fatigue, supporting graded rehabilitation treatment paradigms.
We found that crowding, an indicator of deprivation, was associated with higher risk of persistent fatigue. Whereas clinical samples of adolescents with CFS frequently show a strong social class bias to higher social groups,25 findings from population-based surveys in adults show that operationally defined CFS is more common in groups with lower socioeconomic status.26 We found no association between ethnicity and persistent fatigue after adjustment for socioeconomic status. This is contrary to findings in reports from clinical samples that CFS is more common in white adolescents,25 although this is likely to be confounded by social class. Birth outside the UK was associated with lower risk of fatigue, independently of socioeconomic status. This suggests that either the experience of fatigue or its reporting may be influenced by cultural changes linked with migration.
Our finding that depressive symptoms increased the risk of persistent fatigue is consistent with a large literature showing that fatigue is associated with depression both in the general adult population27 and in those with persistent fatigue states.28 Young people with CFS have higher levels of psychological distress than healthy peers,29 and studies from psychiatric clinics suggest that around one-third of young people with CFS have significant depression.30 However, we are unaware of population studies of the relationship of persistent fatigue and depression in adolescents. While there may be significant clinical overlap between persistent fatigue and depression, it is notable that these conditions have distinct endocrinological profiles,31 and in epidemiological samples the heritability of fatigue and depression appear independent.27
We did not find smoking to be an independent risk factor for fatigue, contrary to reports from cross-sectional studies among adolescents.2,7 Our finding that having a long-standing illness increased the risk of persistent fatigue confirms findings in adults.8
Prevalence of self-reported CFS was low (0.07%) and similar to estimates from previous reports,5 although school-based studies are likely to significantly underestimate prevalence. The extent to which our findings on persistent symptomatic fatigue have meaning for more severe clinical fatigue syndromes is unclear. Although some have suggested that there is a continuum of fatigue from healthy adolescents to those with CFS,12 this is not a well-accepted view. Thus, our findings cannot be directly generalized to CFS, particularly as we did not collect data on the degree to which fatigue affected daily life. Additionally, power considerations necessitated using a less severe category, those with extreme tiredness 2 or more days per week in both phases, as our sample of interest; of these 84 young people, 25 had daily extreme tiredness in both phases, but this group was too small for modeling. Despite this, studies in adults suggest that there is considerable overlap between chronic symptomatic fatigue and CFS10 and that persistent symptomatic fatigue may be a precursor of CFS.11 This overlap may be more pronounced in children and adolescents, particularly given the move away from the use of adult diagnostic criteria for CFS by new Royal College of Paediatrics and Child Health guidance. These suggest that severe fatigue causing disruption of daily life for more than 3 months is sufficient to justify a diagnosis of CFS if other medical causes are excluded.4 Given these, we believe that our findings concerning the associations of sedentary behaviors, activity, and depression with persistent fatigue have implications for the prevention of subclinical and clinical fatigue states in adolescents.
Persistent severe fatigue is concerningly common in modern adolescents, although CFS itself is rare. Being highly sedentary or highly active independently increased the risk of persistent fatigue, suggesting that divergence in either direction from healthy, age-appropriate levels of activity increases the risk for persistent fatigue. The strong association of depressive symptoms with persistent fatigue confirms that mental health is important in the etiology of chronic fatigue states. These findings need to be further explored in prospective and clinical samples; however, they suggest the possibility that promotion of healthy levels of activity and emotional well-being in adolescence may prevent persistent fatigue states.

Sport Chalet will implement a finance and merchandising system from BearingPoint Inc. that will let it establish a unified platform for Web- and catalog-based multichannel selling and distribution.
Sport Chalet, a $350 million regional specialty sporting goods chain with 45 stores in California, Nevada and Arizona, wanted an integrated system to provide visibility of key metrics to improve decision making and automate manual processes. The 10-month contract with BearingPoint, McLean, VA, covers the integration of the new SAP for Retail and mySAP ERP application throughout Sport Chalet's enterprise. SAP is a major provider of business software.
The company initially engaged BearingPoint in March to define requirements and select a new system that would serve as a foundation for its current operations and support store expansion and growth plans.
In addition to enhancing multichannel capabilities for Sport Chalet, Los Angeles, the new system will let the company's merchants, warehouse personnel, vendors and management analyze and research data more effectively for better inventory control.Lewies answers Bok SOS

Van der Merwe is joined by Tendai Mtawarira in sitting out of the upcoming Test against Scotland this weekend.
Mtawarira is suffering from cervical disc issue and will have to see a specialist in Durban.
Fellow Sharks prop, Lourens Adriaanse, also joins the squad to provide cover in the front row.

L.G. asks from Vineland, NJ on June 21, 2011
Claiming Child on Taxes???
My daughters father just called and asked if he could claim out daughter every other year on taxes. My daughter is 10 and her father and I have always had an agreement amongst ourselves. (we kept it out of the courts) During the school year my daughter lives with me and stays with her father every other weekend. I get $500 a month from him for her. During the summer she stays with him and I get her every other weekend and during this time he does not pay child support. He is not a bad father he is just not helpful financially beyond his child support. Does he have the right to claim her every other year??? I am a single mother with another son and I live pay check to paycheck. It's hard but I manage and my kids are always taken care of. He is married with two other kids living in a beautiful house in a nice part of town. Help!!!! I am angry that he wants to do this but he said it is his right and wants to settle this as adults ...he does not want to take me to court if he does not have to. Is it really worth the fight especially since we have a decent relationship and my daughter is very happy. I don't want her to notice a change in the atmosphere.
So What Happened?™
Thanks everyone for some great advise. I talked to my aunts friend who was the supervisor for child support at welfare and she agreed with the fact that I have every right to say no. I can only hope my decision does not make him turn this into something it does not have to be. That tax money is very important each year. This year it went all to my daughter for expander for her teeth and a gifted program she got into for this summer. Next year she is supposed to get braces and the the tax money is where I would be getting the money to pay for it. Believe when I say my children come first and everything I do and earn is to make there life better. Thanks again and I will keep you posted on the outcome.

Well no it is not his " right" . Fed tax law is clear...the child lives with you for the majority of the year so you get to claim her.

Your anger is justified. This man just tried to punk you out to get his way. Firstly he doesn't have any right to claim the child every other year. That is an agreement that should be done in writing and presented to the court according to the IRS rules.
I received child support in NJ. My guess is that he wants to keep it out of the courts because he probably knows according to the formula used by the system he would be paying you far more than he is right now.
Get yourself prepared by getting a great attorney. Save money anyway possible because I wouldn't advise you to go to court without one but stall him as you prepare to go to court.
In the NJ formula they consider all income from all adults supporting the children and all the children in the house, they then take the support calculation and divide it by your and his percentage of income to determine just how much you each owe the child in support. Think of it like a pie. The state would be determining based on the income that your kid is entilted to $100 a week in support you may be responsible for only $20 because you only make 20% of the income calculated to support the kid. He then would be responsible for the $80 a week for the care of the kid. Visitation and claiming the child on a tax return are all things that can be determined in the order for support and custody.
Keep you emotions on this matter to yourself as you work out how you are going to handle this but it does need to be handled. I'm so angry with him for treating you like this. I loathe when men try to manipulate women because we are women.

Hi, Lil:
Just say, "NO."
"I need the extra income."
He can then make a decision on what he wants to
do about it. You already supplied the reason to say no.
Of course, you don't have to get into an argument with him
about this. You know the drill.
Good luck.

Forget about trying to be nice for the sake of "atmosphere". It's time to get a legal agreement in writing so you are not wondering when your child's father is going to pull the rug out from under you.
Find an attorney or apply for legal aid. Don't let your ex tell you what his rights are. Find out for yourself what the law says in your state. I'm in Oregon, and claim my 2 boys as dependents on my taxes. Their dad and I share custody but I am considered the primary residential parent, so I get to claim them every year. Having everything in writing means I don't have to get angry or worry about whether I'll get child support next year when my ex decides he wants to change things. This is how adults settle things, clearly, legally, in writing. Do it for your daughter.

K.I. answers from Los Angeles on June 21, 2011
My husband and his ex wife split the claiming of taxes.
~I personally think that it is fair to do so too. I mean if you think about it, dads who pay CS and have visitation have to pay monthly CS AND have to keep up a house and a room w/toys and clothes and all that stuff for when the child is at their house...so they deserve a tax break too.
Let me ask you this? Do you pay CS to him during the summer? Seems like you should...to me anyway...if you do not why do you think you shouldn't?
IMO, giving him the option of claiming the child every other year is
more than fair and you should think about doing it?!
The amount of other kids he has and what kind of house he lives in is not relevant in the slightest bit...that just makes you seem jealous and petty.

T.L. answers from St. Louis on June 21, 2011
I think it is only fair that he gets to claim your daughter every other year. I also think it is fair that he doesn't pay child support when she is staying with him. At that point in time he is caring for her 100%. $500 a month should be plenty to take care of a 10 y.o.
This is just a general statement for all parents who receive child support, but. It seems that most parents that receive child support rely on this money and they shouldn't. This is not guaranteed money and can stop at any time. This money should be put aside for the care of the child. New shoes, daycare expenses, extra activities. Just my thoughts though. I know it is easier said then done.

J.F. answers from Scranton on June 22, 2011
The way the new tax laws are set up he can not claim her without you signing a paper allowing it that has to be filed with the IRS. The law now trumps whatever was set up in court via divorce/support courts. The way its set up now is the parent who has the child/children 51% of the time is the only one who can claim them without filing paper work. I forget which number was assigned to said paperwork but you can call the IRS and get that information you can also ask that a block be put on her SS number so that only you can file using her. We went through this, this year. The IRS was very helpful in this matter and kicked back the ex's taxes and let ours go through with my child on it!

A.J. answers from Williamsport on June 22, 2011
Hmmm. I think the reason he is asking you is that he can't just do it because he DOESN'T have the right. Check with a good attorney and accountant. Sounds to me that by threatening you, he may unwittingly be poking the hornets nest because he's not paying enough child support, and he'd be sorry if you went to court, so I'd call him on that bluff. Child support should be year round. Being on good terms with your ex should not be contingent on you giving to much, which you already are. Don't let him bully you. Know your rights. You may be best off going to court actually. Speak to a few experts in your state.

L.M. answers from New York on June 21, 2011
According to the IRS the person who claims the child, is who the child lived with the majority of the time. This would be you. There are exceptions, so he could claim her every other year if you agree to it. IMO no way!!!
If he wants to settle this as adults, that means coming up with a legal written agreement. Although, I would recommend going through the courts, to the best of my knowledge it's not necessary. The two of you can draw up an agreement, sign it and have it notarized.
Just another thought... It sounds like he could afford alot more than $500 a month (unless his new family is living off of his spouses income). I would consult with an attorney.

C.C. answers from San Francisco on June 21, 2011
I don't know if it's the same from state to state, but here in CA, if you have 51%+ physical custody of the child, you can legally claim them every year on your taxes, unless there is some other agreement worked out. A friend of mine recently discovered this, as he has slightly more than 50% custody of his kids, and his tax attorney told him that is how the law reads. So actually, since you have way more than 50% custody, you should be able to claim your daughter on your taxes every year. Tell your husband that's fine if he wants to take it to court - then you will also re-negotiate child support at that time. (This friend of mine makes around $50K per year, his ex makes more than that, and the courts were making him pay $800/month in child support for 2 kids even though he has more than 50% custody - go figure! So it sounds like you could probably be getting a lot more in child support if you need it!)

S.W. answers from Minneapolis on June 21, 2011
A lot of divorced families do alternate the tax deduction each year. But then, a lot of fathers pay support every month, all year long, no matter if they have extended summer visitation.
You may want to attempt to negotiate an increase in total support, in exchange for the tax deduction. I agree that you want to keep this out of the courts, as that will cost you both more than the tax deduction is worth. And cause resentment.
BTW - it is not his business whether you are single or married, or have other children or not. It is his business if he is paying the proper amount of child support given what his income is now. You might want to check with an authority in your state to see if $500 x 9 months is reasonable.
One thing my ex and I did was to figure out who would get the biggest tax break, I claimed our daughter, then I shared half of the tax deduction with him. Well, not truly with him, it went into our daughter's bank account to catch up on her expenses.
If you are able to discuss this with him, maybe you could share how much of a benefit it is for each of you, and come to an agreement that would be better for both of you.

Please get advice from an accountant. The last thing you need is trouble with the IRS. Someone in your area can surely give you the name of an accountant who can answer this one simple question for not much money. Our accountant gave us good information before we used her professionally and charged nothing for it. The IRS and state revenue services have strict rules about these things.
D.W. answers from Philadelphia on June 23, 2011
I would say that it is usually standard to share who claims the child. I think it is standard that it is every other year the other parent can claim the child on their taxes. I would say it is fair. I think that he pays regular child support and that you both have a good relationship. As parents, I think that many of us struggle with the current economy. Many parents live pay check to paycheck.
J.L. answers from Chicago on June 21, 2011
Since she spends the majority of her time with you i would say hell no if he is financially better off then you are not to mention you are the custodial parent.
How did you come up with $500 a month? Is this an agreement you have with him without the legal system? If it is are you sure you are receiving enough child support? If not, I certainly would have him increase the child support and then you could consider this.
If it starts to get ugly I am afraid you will need to pursue this with an attornery to make sure you are getting what is owed for the support of your family.
E.M. answers from Honolulu on June 21, 2011
Tell him you will need more in child support on the years he claims her.... I suggest it be how much you would get for claiming her on your taxes.
I think that if he gets more than you for claiming her then he should always claim her and pay you more in child support every year... I am betting though that he will not get any financial benefit from this though...
B.B. answers from Philadelphia on June 22, 2011
I know you said that you have kept everything out of court, but legally the parent that pays child support has the right to claim the child on their taxes. He actually has the right to claim her every year. I know it will be hard, but rather than put yourself and your daughter through a huge court battle, it might be worth it to let him claim her every other year. Hope it all works out.
K.B. answers from Philadelphia on June 22, 2011
In my opinion, he has every right to share in the tax deduction. The fact that he has a better life style depends on different factors. Does his new wife work? There could be a compromise. You can always tell him that if you both went to court he may get to take the tax deduction every other year, but you will have to right to ask for more child support and could certainly get it as it doesn't sound like much money if he's living the good life, especially if the good life is by his sole employment. Compromise by asking for more child support and then he can have the tax deduction every other year.
With that said, I think there is a thing out there where divorced parents each get a partial of shared children. You may want to call H&R Block or some place to get some details before you make a decision.
Just remind him that no, he does not want to go to court because he may get his way, but you may also get yours by the courts giving you much more child support. And also, remember, any other children and spouses have nothing to do with child support on any one particular child. Doesn't matter if you have another child or not. Courts don't care about that, just like they won't care how many other children he has. They care about how much money he makes and what percentage of his income should go to this one particular child.
Make some phone calls and get some facts about how much courts generally award for child support and also about shared tax deductions.

C.W. answers from Dallas on June 21, 2011
Check the IRS code. It states that if there is a conflict on who claims the child/children then the custodial parent claims the child/children. It is the tie breaker rule. Unfortunately, if he is already threatening to fight you on this I would say to get a lawyer.
F.H. answers from Phoenix on June 21, 2011
I didn't read your prior responses but in my divorce decree it states my ex can claim our son and me our daughter only IF HE IS CURRENT ON CHILD SUPPORT. I believe that is the standard AZ wording. So far he is always laid off and behind so each year I have gotten to claim BOTH kids!!!So yes, it is fair for him to do that if he does all that he's supposed to. Good luck.
C.A. answers from Tucson on June 21, 2011
if he helps support her it is in his rights to claim on taxes. you could go to mediation to get it figured out.
D.H. answers from Louisville on June 21, 2011
You don't state if there is any documentation to your agreement (just that it wasn't in the courts), but the IRS usually requires the custodial parent to provide a certain form to the non-custodial parent saying they are allowing the non-cp to claim tbe child that year.
Another question for you - not trying to get in your business, but do you claim EIC with/for you/your children. (wondering since you say it's paycheck to paycheck) Just remember, you may lose EIC if someone else claims the child.

Occurred : 2/19/2009 19:00 (Entered as : 02/19/09 19:00)
Reported: 2/20/2009 1:20:36 AM 01:20
Posted: 3/19/2009
Location: Stevenson Ranch, CA
Shape: Light
Duration:40 minutes
Observed with the naked eye, an unusually bright white round object in the North Western. night sky of Santa Clarita Valley in Southern California. It appeared to stay in the same position (approx. 10:00 position) 30 minutes or better with the intensity never changing. During this initial observation the object never came closer or farther in respect to our viewing location; basically the object size never changed. Orion’s belt was viewed almost due West at approximately 11 o’clock position from our viewing position. We heard no noise or saw no indication of a missile launch out of Vandenburg Air Force Base; next launch is scheduled for February 24, 2009 per Vandenburg’s calendar. The object was than observed through the side sighting scope of an amateur telescope (D: 60mm; F: 700mm) where the following was observed: object had a dark center, with a white band with red and blue colors radiating outward from the white outer band perimeter. Object remained a full round shape 90% of the time. However, it changed from that frontal view round shape and rotated on its vertical axis maintaining same vertical size, but it changed its’ vertical shape to half the original frontal view; then its’ shape shifted like a saucer rounded on one edge and flat on the other edge; then it rotated and titled some more and its’ shape became an oval and went into a horizontal position. Within 30-45 seconds after changing to that final position the object descended below the visible horizon. The color lights remained the same throughout this observation. The view through the main telescope was further validated by one of the observers. One observer; having worked on highly secretive military aircraft; and that observer understands the maneuverability of aircraft; believes these observations are beyond any known comprehensible understanding of present day aircraft to his knowledge. As of this date has anyone reported sightings similar to our observations?

Representatives from the South Coast Air Quality Management District reassured concerned citizens that they are continuing to monitor the air quality in Claremont and the surrounding cities.
A town hall meeting was held in Taylor Hall in Claremont to address the topic of air quality in the East San Gabriel Valley.
The meeting allowed the AQMD to listen to residents’ questions and concerns on the negative effects the poor air quality has on the area.
“We are encouraged by residents who came out tonight, so we know what concerns there are,” board member and Mayor of Chino Dennis Yates said.
A Power Point presentation acquainted the residents to the agency’s purpose and explained the reasons poor air quality exists.
The main problem is the mobile sources such as cars, trains and buses, which contribute over 75 percent of the emissions in the region.
“There is a higher risk value around the freeways because there are many mobile sources around there,” board member Rudy Eadon said during his presentation.
The effect of poor air quality affects everyone, but targets specifically senior citizens or those with respiratory problems such as asthma.
Barbara Moreno said she was there to represent the retirement community of Claremont and is concerned for their health, since they are allowed daily morning walks.
A discussion on initiatives being passed to set guidelines and regulations on local mining companies was an important factor to the improvements being made to clear the air.
“As a mother and hopefully a cancer survivor, I was pleased to hear the new initiatives passed,” said Marylou Ferry, a concerned Claremont resident.
“There’s more and more families here asking to be taken seriously out here and care about the kids,” she added. “My kids are gasping for breath – it breaks my heart.”
Other inhabitants agreed with Ferry and shared personal stories in how they were directly affected and obtained feedback from the representatives of AQMD.
“People’s lungs are burning,” said Marla Law Abrolat, a pediatrician and asthma specialist, “The ozone is higher in Pomona. Asthma symptoms have risen.”
The AQMD reassured the citizens that new regulations would be passed by January 2006 to improve the air quality and limit the objects that harm the ozone layer.
The AQMD is an agency that provides money for studies throughout the San Gabriel Valley and Orange County. They also create new initiatives by cutting emissions from local ports.
They also assist local business owners to be conscious with the issue and helps in environmental justice issues.
To most people air quality is an important issue.
For one resident an analogy is used to compare the problems of unhealthy bad air quality to a disease. His point is that both can be either treated or prevented.
“Prevention is a lot easier than to cure,” Charles Majestro, a resident said. “One way to kill it is to get rid of the disease.”

Here we find CNN propagating their misconceptions again. "Deep inside the West Bank." Karnei Shomrom is a 15 minute ride from Kfar Saba. How far do you drive in 15 minutes? To the local mall? Local grocery store? 15 freaking minutes. It's 30 minutes to Ariel, that's central West Bank, 45 minutes to Elon Moreh, that's about as far in as qualifies as West Bank, and another 20 minutes to the Jordan Valley (which, I guess, is past the West Bank.)
For perspective, it takes 15 minutes to drive from the KOTEL to Kever Rochel, that's Bet Lechem (Bethlehem), supposedly another country (Philstine, ah, Palestine).
Perspective is an amazing thing. I recently had a Shabbos guest from Utrich, Holland. She mentioned she sometimes goes on a shopping trip to Berlin (Germany). I'm thinking, O M G, such distant traveling for shopping??? So I asked her, "how long does it take to get there." She answered, "about an hour and a half".
Apparently for this reporter, deep in the West Bank is a 1 hour trip from his hotel in Tel Aviv.

For the astronomers that solved the problem of “quenched galaxy” growth it was simply a matter of perspective.
[[nid:1368689]]
The quenched galaxies from the universe.
Led by Marcella Carollo, from ETH Zurich, in Switzerland, a team of astronomers used the Hubble Space Telescope’s COSMOS, Cosmological Evolution Survey, to solve the mystery of the growing quenched galaxies. Hubble’s COSMOS provides researchers with 575 views of the universe using the Advanced Camera for Surveys. The researchers examined distant quenched galaxies, going as far back as eight billion years into the universe’s past. Using COSMOS, the Canada–France–Hawaii Telescope and the Subaru Telescope, the astronomers observed data from an area of the universe approximately nine times that of the moon..
[[nid:1368737]]
Galaxies today are much larger and shut off at a later stage. Co-author Simon Lilly, from ETH Zurich, said the “the mistaken impression of individual galaxy growth over time” was due to larger galaxies, with more material to form stars, shutting off at a later time. Carollo said, “Whenever we see simplicity in nature amidst apparent complexity, it's very satisfying.”
Alvio Renzini, from the INAF Padua Observatory in Italy, had an earthly analogy when explaining the solution to the mystery. Renzini said, “It's like saying that the increase in the average apartment size in a city is not due to the addition of new rooms to old buildings, but rather to the construction of new, larger apartments,” said in a statement.
The scope of COSMOS allowed researchers to study each galaxy in the same manner, allowing for a definitive comparison. “No single collection of images has been large enough to enable us to study very large numbers of galaxies in exactly the same way,” said Carollo. The team’s research will be published in The Astrophysical Journal.
A video giving a zoomed-in glimpse of a section of the universe as observed by COSMOS can be viewed below.Dean, College of Education

Location, ST | website.comPrepare to have your breath taken away. Apple unveiled iOS 7 at its Worldwide Developers Conference today, giving the public its first official sneak peek at the massive, design-conscious overhaul coming to the mobile operating system that runs your iPhone, iPad, and iPod touch. Here are the most exciting new and updated features.
An updated design
One of the first things you’ll notice about iOS 7 is that it pays an incredible amount of attention to graphic design. There are new app icons, improved typography and a minimalist approach that removes unneeded clutter, lines and color when they get in the way. The home screen is lush and vibrant, but apps like Calendar use color to help organize your life and keep your day on track. Address and search bars are hidden in Safari until you swipe to reveal them. Even the Weather app has undergone a graphic upgrade.
The new operating system uses motion sensing to create a 3D parallax illusion, making it appear as if your icons are floating above your background. It’s an absolutely unnecessary feature that is beyond gorgeous, putting an exclamation point on the operating system graphic redesign.
Notifications
Your phone’s Notification Center is getting a much-needed upgrade in iOS 7. Information is broken up into three tabs: a Today tab, which shows your calendar appointments, the current weather and even local traffic conditions; a Missed tab, which shows you all those text messages and push notifications that happened since the last time you used your phone; and an All tab, which lets you sift through every notification you received in the last 24 hours.
Control Center
In iOS 6, some of the most important phone features, such as turning on Wi-Fi and enabling Bluetooth, are hidden away in a Settings submenu. Not in iOS 7: A fully loaded Control Center can be summoned by swiping your finger up from any screen. All the important features you’re familiar with are there, as are a few new ones. Now, you can quickly access your phone’s calculator, turn on AirPlay, play and pause music–even use the new built-in flashlight feature (finally!).
Photography
Photography has always been a major part of the smartphone experience, and in iOS 7, your picture collection is getting a major update. Open the Camera app, and you’ll notice it looks a lot like Instagram, complete with eight new retro filters and an option to take square photos.
Once taken, photos are automatically organized into three groupings based on dates and locations. So a week-long trip to New York City will automatically appear in your photos as its own “Collection,” an easily found grouping of all the pictures you took while there. Inside that Collection are individual “Moments” – photos taken from the top of Rockfeller Center or shots from Central Park. You can even search your photos by year.
Multitasking
Doing more than one thing at once on a smartphone is admittedly a tall order. Apple has made strides to allow for multitasking in the past – you can use Facebook while an MP3 plays in the background, for example. But now, multitasking is built in to all iOS apps, not just a musical few. And switching between apps is easy – a simple matter of swiping your finger across the screen.
The new iOS 7 learns from how you use the phone, automatically updating apps based on your usage history. If you check your email when you wake up in the morning, your phone will learn to look for new messages immediately before you wake up. And, your phone will prioritize updates for energy efficiency, taking advantage of those moments your phone connects to Wi-Fi. In short: With iOS 7, your iPhone battery should last longer.
Find my Phone
The iPhone is a pretty popular device with tech junkies and thieves alike. With that in mind, Apple added a number of new security features that make it harder for the bad guys to sell a stolen phone and easier for you to recover yours.
Erase your phone remotely, and a lock screen message will provide good Samaritans with an alternate phone number to contact you. Erasing your phone’s memory now requires you to enter your Apple password. And, should you get your phone back after you erased it, entering your password will let you undo the damage and start restoring your phone to the way it was.
iTunes Radio
Following in the trend of copying third-party apps, Apple is introducing a Pandora-like streaming radio service this fall called iTunes Radio. The app works much the same way other streaming apps do, giving you the ability to create personalized radio stations. But, it also gives you the ability to purchase songs directly on iTunes and control the flow of music through Siri voice commands.
AirDrop
Your iPhone is finally getting the ability to share photos, videos and contacts directly with other Bluetooth-enabled devices using a feature called AirDrop. Tap the new “Share” button and you’ll be given a list of nearby devices you can securely beam your content to. No complicated setup is required, and you can easily turn off AirDrop so strangers won’t be able to see and beam questionable material to your phone.
iOS in the Car
One killer feature of iOS 7 won't be available at launch: iOS in the Car. The new functionality essentially takes your smartphone's screen and mirrors it in your car, letting you see and control music, GPS, answer phone calls and use other features all without touching your phone. A slew of major car manufacturers will be including this functionality in their 2014 models, including Chevrolet, Ferrari, Honda, Jaguar, Kia, Mercedes, Nissan, Volvo and more.
Coming this Fall
Owners of the iPhone 4, 4S, and 5 will be able to upgrade to iOS 7 for free this fall, when the new 2013 iPhone is released. Not all features will be available on some older models, due to their slower processors. The iPad 2, iPad Retina, and iPad mini will all be able to run iOS 7, as well as the iPod touch 16GB, 32GB, and 64GB.
IOS7 a reluctant love affair…
From Doug Asker on June 14, 2013 :: 5:53 am
I have already been testing iOS7 on my iPhone 5 for the last week. Being truthful I fell just a little tepid regarding the whole encounter. After years of design advancement why have Apple decided to make their OS seem like a poor relation of Microsoft’s Windows 8. On the other side it seems to have borrowed heavily from Android. Now you can swipe up to turn on/off WIFI, blue tooth, much like Android.To conclude I like: Newsstand, the integrated flashlight, screen transition, new compass interface and mail interface.
I don’t like: no bulk delete function in the mail program, it’s still message by message deletion. The pseudo windows interface and menu movement. The settings menu is a bit of a waste land of white space.
Like an aging husband and wife I am finding more faults with it as time goes on but I grow to love it the more time I spend with it.

Amazing considering he had ACL surgery just a year ago. Even though he didn't get it I'm sure it'll be remembered as the most impressive season a running backs ever had if you think about everything he went through.
its a shame, i was really pulling for him to break it. so close! if only he could of finished off that last run with a td instead of the drive ending with a fg, he would of broke it by 1 or 2 yards lol. amazing season though by an amazing player.
As a Vikings fan, used to coming up short. But he had a great year, and because of him, it's not over.

The Cult of Gattis'The Amazing Spider-Man' Countdown: Spider-Man Swings Through the 1970s.
Yes, the Sam Raimi movies were pretty good, but don’t even act like The Amazing Spider-Man is the character’s first reboot. Before the 1970s were over, fans were subjected to FOUR different versions of their beloved wallcrawler. And worse yet, almost none of them were anything like the comic book character! So, relax. Don’t sweat the reboot. The worst that could happen to Spider-Man has already happened. Read on...
Spider-Man (1967-1970)
When you hear “Spider-Man, Spider-Man, does whatever a spider can,” you’re hearing the catchy theme song to the very first Spider-Man animated series. The show maintains Spidey’s charm, with his trademark quips and crazy rogues gallery, even through the crude, noticeably cheap animation. The show ran for 52 episodes, with the first two seasons airing on Saturday mornings on ABC.
Fun Facts: Infamous animator Ralph Bakshi (Fritz the Cat, Lord of the Rings) produced seasons 2 and 3 of the show.
The Electric Company (“Spidey Super Stories” segment, 1971-1977)
Strangely, this is the version of Spider-Man that I grew up with -- an oddly mute wallcrawler who loved teaching phonics. It’s the first live-action depiction of Spider-Man, and It’s especially weird to see this footage today, with a shabby Spidey interacting with an impossibly young Morgan Freeman. His dialogue appears as simple word balloons (accompanied by what sounds like a pop and a duck quack), designed to get children excited to read (it worked for me!). There were 28 “Spidey Super Stories” segments produced over the course of The Electric Company’s run.
Fun Facts: Not a single Spider-Man villain from the Marvel comics appeared on The Electric Company, though he did take on Morgan Freeman as Dracula and a character named “Sandman” who put folks to sleep.
)
The Amazing Spider-Man (1977-1979)
For a character known for his quick wit, Spider-Man rarely gets a chance to mouth off in his live-action depictions. Here, Nicholas Hammond played a perfectly stoic Peter Parker and a near-silent Spider-Man for thirteen sporadic episodes that aired on CBS over the course of three years. The show never really found a foothold as episodes were too expensive to produce, and creator Stan Lee was vocal about the show’s dull plots.
Fun Facts: Once again, Spider-Man never faced any Marvel super-villains on his own show, instead facing off against terrorists, mad scientists, and theives.
Spider-Man (??????? aka “Supaidaman”1978-1979)
It would be tough to re-invent Spider-Man as any less faithful than he appears in Toei’s version. The Japanese sentai version Spider-Man (think Power Rangers) launched from a movie into 41 episodes of the least Spidey-like Spider-Man show that ever hit the airwaves. Peter Parker’s Japanese counterpart Takuya Yamashiro gains spider-powers from an enchanted bracelet given to him by an alien. Spider-Man can also transform the alien’s ship into a giant robot named Leopardon. While not exactly (or remotely) canon, Stan Lee reportedly liked the show. You can stream most of the episodes directly from Marvel’s own site.
Fun Fact: “Friendly neighborhood Spider-Man?” Not here. In Toei’s version, Spider-Man referred to himself as “Messenger from Hell, Spider-Man” and “Iron Cross Killer Spider-Man.”
News from the Web
-- Fans won’t have to wait too long for a sequel (of sorts) to Amazing Spider-Man. Activision’s upcoming video game tie-in will take place immediately after the events of the film. Using something that development house Beenox calls “Web Rush technology,” the trailer promises a free-roaming Spidey game, peppered with New York City landmarks.
-- A lot of folks were disappointed that the first “official” look at the Lizard came in the form of a Pez dispenser, but I’d like to direct my outrage at Pez for switching from heads to busts. A Pez dispenser is supposed to be a big ol’ candy-spittin’ noggin! If I wanted busts, I’d go to a museum. As for the look of the Lizard himself, it’s appropriately Ditko-esque (I think many fans were hoping for something closer to Todd McFarlane’s take on the beast). I don’t think it’s a coincidence that another, better image of the villain appeared the very same week, as a piece of concept art from Spidermedia.ru. He’s missing his lab coat and purple pants, but it looks like the classic Lizard to me!
-- Newsarama featured a list of “10 Things You Might Not Know About Spider-Man.” Some of the details are things most Spider-Man fans will know (Spidey sense, mechanical web shooters), but there are some other bits on there that don’t immediately come to mind when one thinks of Spider-Man (like the fact that Peter Parker’s parents were super-spies).
-- The first theatrical teaser poster for The Amazing Spider-Man has been revealed, prompting many to wonder what “untold story” they’re talking about. Personally, I think the simple adjective “amazing” at the bottom of the poster would’ve been more effective. Promising an “untold story” muddies the fact that this is a completely new movie, not a never-revealed side story to the events we’ve already seen in the original trilogy. The design carries over the brooding look that’s been so pervasive in all of Sony’s marketing material for the film so far.
There are 204 days until the release of The Amazing Spider-Man on July 3, 2012. The Marc Webb film stars Andrew Garfield, Emma Stone, and Rhys If.Morocco, Tafilalet Region
A Berber nomad sits in front of her tent and spins. She has been widowed and she no longer travels from one spot to the other. Her home is her tent. The wool she is spinning will be used to repair it or to make it larger. Her tent is set behind the dunes of the Erg Chebbi where the reg desert begins and there is forage for her goats.
Tour guides bring tourists to look in her tent and to photograph her. She earns some money from tips. She cannot get to the market and must ask the tour guides to bring her sugar, tea and flour. They don’t always do it. People in the village know she has a hard life, but they do not seem to feel that they should make an effort to help her. I visited her many times and, over the years, she did well without any help.

When it comes to Sinatra -- even the older, Vegas model -- virtually everything he did just reeked of awesome and A Jolly Christmas from Frank Sinatra was no exception. Seriously, who else could sing the words, "Oh, by gosh by golly, it's time for mistletoe and holly" and not sound like a complete dork? Frank, that's who.
Jolly was Sinatra's first Christmas record released in 1953 during his vaunted years on Capitol Records. It features the Ralph Brewster Singers and some of the finest ensemble arrangements you'll find on any vocal standards record ever made. The bonus tracks that came with the CD release of Jolly included arrangements from the legendary Nelson Riddle.
For a time, the record was re-packaged with a Christmas tree ornament on the cover and simply titled The Sinatra Christmas Album but the full cover was eventually restored and, in 2010, a vinyl pressing was released.
The thing about Sinatra is that his deep, powerful baritone gives a certain gravitas to everything he sings. This is evident on the more traditional carols on the record including "Silent Night," "Adeste Fideles" and his stirring rendition of "O Holy Night." But, for all the seriousness, he still knows how to swing and his classic arrangement of "Jingle Bells" is a perfect example as is the one almost giddy original on the album "Mistletoe and Holly."
I still think his versions of "White Christmas" and "A Christmas Song" are easily comparable to Bing Crosby and Nat King Cole, respectively, and his version of "Have Yourself a Merry Little Christmas" is my all time favorite and arguable the best ever.
This is, at times, a pretty weighty record. It doesn't shy away from carols, which is something many albums do to avoid the more solemn, church-y vibe that comes with them. On this album, however, they just take on a rich, reverent tone that isn't heavy or boring and the wartime material is appropriately mournful without being overwrought. Any artist who wants to make a great Christmas album should set the bar here and hope to come close to it. This was clearly a carefully crafted record -- not just some throwaway bunch of Christmas ditties -- and, on it, Sinatra is as good as ever... and just as cool.

While trying to take my mind off that nauseating feeling building in my stomach halfway across the Cook Strait last Sunday, I was reading a bit in Physicsworld about measuring an electron’s electric dipole moment. (By way of quick explanation – an electron has a negative charge on it, but is this charge uniformly distributed over the electron, or does one end of it hold more charge than the other? If the latter, it has an electric dipole moment.) Conventional physics (e.g. ‘The Standard Model’ of particle physics) says it won’t have an electric dipole moment, but there are reasons for thinking it might.
Anyway, I won’t go into the details, other than to say the article was written by Chad Orzel (author of ‘How to Teach Physics to your Dog’) who is clearly extremely enthusiastic about this subject. He talks a bit about the relative merits of the mulit-billion dollar Large Hadron Collider (LHC) against the dirt-cheap-by-comparison electron-dipole-moment (EDM) experiments for establishing the existence of new physics beyond the Standard Model. But the thing that made me laugh (and momentarily forget that I was trapped in a floating metal container 10 km from land) was the lovely comment "…we will probably need a combination of both measurements [LHC and EDM] to fully explain the universe we live in."
Is it just me, or is this a rather ambitious statement to make? Will the LHC and EDM together will tell us everything we could possibly want to know about the universe? I think, perhaps, we’d need a bit more besides these two. Well, actually, a whole lot more. But I applaude his enthusiasm.
The study of physics is important in order to have a better understanding of our surroundings. This is because the subject sets up our fundamental principles that we live by and use to understand the world around us. As we discussed in our physics class, every situation involves physics. From backing out of your driveway to throwing a ball with your friends. Due to this constant integration with everyday life the study of this subject has to have a key integration when considering your overall education, as it was stated in the original post “physics is essential for life”. There is a definite parallel to this statement in that “physics is essential in education”. So on an ending note, there should be no debate about the importance of physics education while going through school, because it is essential for having an understanding of the world around us.Hi,<br><br>I have recently installed torque 2.1.8 in a small cluster of Penitum's D EM64T, I'll run Gaussian 03 in parallel, it's possible in Torque??<br><br>I have the Gaussian 03 with Linda (64 bits), but i don't have idea of the configuration about the queue for Gaussian parallel jobs <br><br><br>Any ideas??<br><br>Thanks for you time and you help.<br><br>Victor Gomez<br><br>I couldn't believe how easy it was and right away I started getting into a conversation with fun people who were from the same area as me and had related interests.

Exodus 20
Exodus 20:15
15. Thou shalt not steal.
15. Non furaberis.
THE REPETITION OF THE SAME COMMANDMENT
Deuteronomy 5
Deuteronomy 5:19
19. Neither shalt thou steal.
19. Non furaberis.
Since charity is the end of the Law, we must seek the definition of theft from thence. This, then, is the rule of charity, that every one’s rights should be safely preserved, and that none should do to another what he would not have done to himself. It follows, therefore, that not only are those thieves who secretly steal the property of others, but those also who seek for gain from the loss of others, accumulate wealth by unlawful practices, and are more devoted to their private advantage than to equity. Thus, rapine is comprehended under the head of theft, since there is no difference between a man’s robbing his neighbor by fraud or force. But, in order that God may the better withhold His people from all fraudulent injustice, He uses the word theft, which all naturally abhor as disgraceful. For we know under how many coverings men bury their misdeeds; and not only so, but also how they convert them into praise by false pretexts. Craft and low cunning is called prudence; and he is spoken of as provident and circumspect who cleverly overreaches others, who takes in the simple, and insidiously oppresses the poor. Since, therefore, the world boasts of vices as if they were virtues, and thus all freely excuse themselves in sin, God wipes away all this gloss, when tie pronounces all unjust means of gain to be so many thefts. Nor let us be surprised that this decision should be given by the divine tribunal, when the philosophers deliver nearly the same doctrine.
We must bear in mind also, that an affirmative precept, as it is called, is connected with the prohibition; because, even if we abstain from all wrong-doing, we do not therefore satisfy God, who has laid mankind under mutual obligation to each other, that they may seek to benefit, care for, and succor their neighbors. Wherefore He undoubtedly inculcates liberality and kindness, and the other duties, whereby human society is maintained; and hence, in order that we may not be condemned as thieves by God, we must endeavor, as far as possible, that every one should safely keep what he possesses, and that our neighbor’s advantage should be promoted no less than our own.Find out more about decorative stone
There is plenty of help available for anyone identifying decorative stone, and researching the history and impact of the stone trade, or preparing urban geological trails. As well as the Corsi collection, the Oxford University Museum of Natural History has other collections of decorative stones comprising around 1,000 historic and modern samples. Other useful sources of information about decorative stone include museum and private collections, commercial and educational websites, and a wide range of general and specialist books and journal articles.
Some of the best places to see our heritage of decorative stone are in the shopping malls, churches, and public buildings of our towns and cities. ‘Town walks’ and ‘geological trails’ also offer fascinating ways to explore millions of years of geological history. Polished stone in the high street can reveal evidence of volcanic explosions, ancient seas, and the thrusting upwards of mountain chains.
Polished stone in Belfast City HallA new study of social housing by Peter King, Reader in Social Thought at De Montfort University*, argues that all present government support for social housing including Housing Benefit and subsidises paid to social housing providers should be scrapped and replaced with a single means-tested cash benefit paid to those on low incomes.
Potentially £20bn would be available for a direct cash benefit using money from the present Housing Benefit and social housing subsidy schemes. The cash benefit would be paid directly to the recipient and depend on local housing costs, but would not have to be spent on housing.
King argues that the present system of support for social housing means that government rather than tenants or landlords increasingly take decisions about rent levels and quality of housing. Despite government rhetoric, housing policy is becoming more centralised. Decision-making power has been removed from tenants and landlords, so that tenants have little incentive to drive down rents and landlords little incentive to improve their properties.
The provision of high quality, affordable housing for those on low incomes can be best attained by providing those on low incomes with choice and autonomy. Hence, King argues for more choice via direct payments and the end of social housing.
These policies have been successful in Australia, New Zealand and some continental European countries. They would end the stigma attached to social housing as individuals rather than particular forms of housing would receive government support.

A 60-year-old man is in serious condition in hospital with the new coronavirus that was discovered in Saudi Arabia last year. Reports that he passed it onto his son have prompted comparisons between the new virus and SARS, the disease that killed 775 of the 8000 known people it infected worldwide in 2003. But how sensible are the comparisons?
What kind of disease does the virus cause, and can it spread?
The man hospitalised in Manchester, UK, late last month has severe pneumonia caused by the new coronavirus – so severe, his blood is being oxygenated outside his body. The UK Health Protection Agency (HPA) reported on Wednesday that the man's son has now been hospitalised with the virus in Birmingham.
The first man had recently travelled to Pakistan and Saudi Arabia, and fell ill after four days in Saudi. His son lives in the UK and had not been abroad – in fact he is the first of the 11 cases known so far who is not a resident of Saudi Arabia, Qatar or Jordan. The HPA says he probably caught the virus from his father.
Does this mean the virus has the ability to spread quickly among people?
No. The son had health issues which may have lowered his immunity, says the HPA. And no one else who has come into contact with the two has fallen sick, so far.
Indeed, other than the son, nobody who has been in close contact with people known to be infected with the new virus have so far tested positive for it. "If novel coronavirus were more infectious, we would have expected to have seen a larger number of cases," says John Watson, head of respiratory diseases at the HPA.
Is this the first case of person-to-person transmission of this virus?
No. Last April, before the new coronavirus was discovered, eleven people in Jordan, including eight healthcare workers in an intensive care unit, came down with severe pneumonia. Their samples tested negative for any respiratory pathogens known at the time. But after the new coronavirus was discovered in pneumonia patients from Qatar and Saudi Arabia in September, the Jordan samples were retested. Two of the healthcare workers, who had died, tested positive for the new virus.
The cluster in Jordan raised the possibility of human-to-human transmission, said the World Health Organization, even though not all the cases were reported as testing positive for the virus.
This is not impossible: in the cases confirmed so far, the virus mainly affects tissues deep inside the lungs, and may not have been present in a sample from further up the respiratory tract.
This is worrying as healthcare workers were among the chief victims of the SARS virus in 2003. Hospital workers are being closely monitored in Manchester and Birmingham.
Three people who contracted the virus in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, last October were also members of the same family, according to Saudi health authorities. Two died. But we do not know if these people gave the infection to each other, or if all were exposed to the same source in the environment. The results of a survey of wildlife in the region for similar viruses have not yet been released.
Why does everyone keep mentioning SARS?
It was also a coronavirus that caused SARS (severe acute respiratory syndrome). That virus jumped from bats to humans in southern China and spread worldwide in 2003, killing 775 people. The new coronavirus is most closely related to coronaviruses that come from bats, although that doesn't prove it is from bats or that it will do what SARS did.
A study in December found that most European health authorities have the facilities to perform a test for the new coronavirus. One problem, though, is knowing who to test. As well as being infected with the novel coronavirus, the 60-year-old man hospitalised in Manchester also had a flu virus when he was first examined. If such co-infection is common, many people with pneumonia who test positive for flu could be treated for that without being tested for any other viruses, leaving the new coronavirus to slip under the.2 British Teens Hurt in Acid Attack in Zanzibar They were volunteering at local school By John Johnson, Newser Staff Posted Aug 8, 2013 12:16 PM CDT STORY COMMENTS (16) (Newser) – Two British teenagers were splashed with acid by attackers on a motorcycle as they walked along a street in the African island of Zanzibar, reports Reuters. Katie Gee and Kirstie Trup, both 18, suffered injuries to their face, chest, and hands in the attack last night, but both are out of the hospital, reports the BBC. Authorities are trying to fly them back to Britain today. They had been volunteering as teachers at a local a school. "The two attackers passed by several white tourists in the area and threw acid after reaching closer to them, which raises suspicion of a planned attack," says an official with the Art in Tanzania charity. Authorities have not speculated about a motive, but they condemned the attack and reminded locals that tourism is essential to Zanzibar, reports CNN. A friend tells the Telegraph that Gee had been slapped in the face about two weeks ago in the street by a woman who was apparently upset that Gee was singing during Ramadan.

Session: 2013/2014
Date: 11 June 2014
Committee for Justice
PDF version of this report (166.8 kb)
The Chairperson: I welcome Mark McGuckin, deputy director from the public legal services division, and Padraig Cullen, principal legal officer of the public legal services division, both from the Department of Justice. You are very welcome. As normal, Hansard will record this session, and it will be published in due course. I will hand over to Mark at this stage.
Mr Mark McGuckin (Department of Justice): Thank you very much, Chairman, for your introduction and for the opportunity to present to the Committee. I will keep my comments brief as the details are set out in the paper that the Committee has before it. The paper includes a summary of the responses received to the consultation document together with the Department's proposed way forward.
The purpose of exceptional grant funding is to provide legal aid funding for representation for persons seeking to participate in certain legal proceedings that fall outside the scope of ordinary legal aid. Legal advice and assistance is already available under the green form scheme, and the exceptional grant scheme would include, for example, inquests into the death of relatives. Under the provisions of the scheme, the Northern Ireland Legal Services Commission can request that the Department authorises funding for exceptional individual cases.
To date, the exceptional grant power has most often been used to provide funding for representation of next of kin at certain inquests to comply with article 2 of the European Convention on Human Rights. It has also been used to provide funding for the representation of the plaintiffs in the Omagh civil action. Potentially, this power can be used to provide funding in exceptional cases that fall outside the scope of ordinary legal aid, either to enable the commission to comply with its duty under the Human Rights Act not to act in a way that is incompatible with a convention right, or to enable the Government to comply with their obligations under the law of the European Union.
Under the current legislation, the Department can either direct that legal aid be provided by the commission in specified categories of cases that fall outside the scope of ordinary legal aid or the Department can authorise funding generically or in respect of an individual case if the commission requests it to do so. To date, there has been only one direction issued in relation to exceptional legal aid — direction 1 on representation at inquests. Funding for the representation of the next of kin at most legacy inquests involving deaths at the hands of agents of the state or where there have been allegations of collusion has been provided under this direction. The other main category of inquests that have been funded under this scheme involves hospital death cases. Representation for the next of kin in such cases has been authorised by the Minister following individual requests from the commission.
Exceptional grant funding was considered as part of the access to justice review, and its report contained a number of relevant recommendations. In particular, it recommended that the Minister should no longer have any decision-making role in the grant of exceptional funding in individual cases. The Minister accepted that recommendation and, recognising that the existing arrangements had been in operation for seven years, commissioned a review of the scheme. The review focused on four particular areas: the delegation of discretion to vary or waive the financial eligibility test; the definition of the term "immediate family" and the application of the financial eligibility test; the remuneration payable to legal representatives; and the scope of proceedings included under direction 1.With the agreement of the Committee, the Department undertook a targeted consultation to seek views and inform decisions on the way forward. Five substantive responses to the consultation were received. Overall, the responses to the proposals in the consultation document were positive, though there were some suggestions about implementation.
In light of those positive responses, the Department proposes to proceed as follows. Decisions on the grant of exceptional funding in individual cases should be the responsibility of the statutory appointee at the head of the legal aid delivery organisation. In practical terms, we propose implementing the change in line with the establishment of the proposed legal services agency. That will be provided by the new article 12A provision to be inserted into the Access to Justice (Northern Ireland) Order 2003.
Once that arrangement is in place, appeals against decisions not to grant funding or further funding in individual cases should be heard by an independent appeal panel. That will be provided by the new article 12A provision to be inserted in the 2003 Order.
The statutory appointee should be given discretion to vary or waive the financial eligibility test, so removing that responsibility from the Minister. That will be provided in the civil legal services financial regulations to be introduced under article 13 of the 2003 Order.
The meaning of the term "immediate family" should be redefined to address issues where an adult has died without a partner and where, potentially, parents, children and siblings are involved and to clarify the application of the financial means test in such cases. That will be provided under the civil legal services financial regulations to be introduced under article 13 of the 2003 Order.
There is a need to reform the fee structure for inquest cases funded under the scheme. However, rather than look at that in isolation, it will be taken forward as part of the wider reform of civil remuneration.
When responsibility for the grant of exceptional funding passes to the legal services agency, decisions on requests for exceptional funding for categories of cases that fall outside the scope of ordinary legal aid will rest with the director of legal aid casework. That will include inquests into deaths that occurred while the deceased was detained by the state under the Mental Health (Northern Ireland) Order 1986. The new article 12A provision to be inserted into the Access to Justice Order 2003 will also provide a mechanism to fund cases of that nature. Potentially, the Department could also issue a direction to the director of legal aid casework in broadly similar terms to the current direction 1, but with the scope of the direction also covering this class of case under the Mental Health Order.
As I mentioned, the provisions to transfer decision-making on application for exceptional funding in individual cases from the Minister to the director of legal aid casework in the proposed new legal services agency is contained in the Legal Aid and Coroners' Courts Bill. The other changes required can be provided for in secondary legislation, which will come before the Committee and the Assembly. The Bill provides the legislative mechanism for the introduction of independent appeals panels to consider appeals. The role of the panels will include hearing appeals against the refusal of an award of exceptional funding or further funding in individual cases.
Further detail on the outcome of the consultation is set out in the post-consultation report. I am happy to address any questions that the Committee might have on the outcome of the consultation and the Department's proposed way forward.
The Chairperson: OK, members. As Mark indicated, in taking this forward, we have already covered some of the proposals in the Legal Aid and Coroners' Courts Bill. The other mechanisms will be introduced by way of secondary legislation, which will obviously have to come to the Committee for detailed scrutiny. That said, if any members want to ask something now, they are at liberty to do so, bearing in mind that we will look at this in detail when the legislation comes before us and then decide whether or not to implement some of what the proposals contain.
Mr McCartney: This is just a broad question. In general, how many inquests are there in any given year?
Mr McGuckin: I do not know off the top of my head.
Mr Padraig Cullen (Department of Justice): We do not have that information about the number of inquests. Of course, we can provide it. If your question is directed at how many applications for that form of funding are received, we will return to you in writing with those details.
Mr McCartney: It will be useful when we scrutinise that. It will be interesting to see how many inquests there actually are.
Mr McGuckin: I can give you the number of inquests and then, to put that into perspective, the number of applications for exceptional grant funding for inquests. That would let you see the volumes.
Mr McCartney: OK. That would be fine.
Mr A Maginness: Just when we are on that issue, is there any figure for the overall cost of exceptional grants to date?
Mr Cullen: Again, we have those details. We can provide them in written form. They are logged separately from the cases that are paid for by way of exceptional legal aid. I am afraid that we do not have those figures to hand.
Ms McCorley: Go raibh maith agat. Do all inquests fall into that category?
Mr McGuckin: Into the exceptional category? Padraig, do you want to take that question?
Mr Cullen: Potentially, the scheme could cover any inquest. However, because of the ambit of the ordinary legal aid scheme, particularly for advice and assistance, which can be provided in any type of legal proceedings, that funding is intended to fund representation by a solicitor and barrister at an inquest hearing. The overall scheme is set up on the basis that it is intended to provide funding in exceptional inquests. Again, the nature of inquest proceedings, like some forms of tribunal proceedings, is that they are intended to be inquisitorial in nature rather than adversarial, which is the normal form of legal proceedings in a civil or criminal court. Therefore, potentially, yes, that funding could be provided in any type of inquest.
However, the scheme is established with limited funding on the basis that it is targeted to fund exceptional inquests; when the next of kin are unable to afford their own representation and, with the inquisitorial nature of inquest proceedings, the nature of the issues to be investigated by the coroner in that particular inquest are serious, coupled with other factors like whether other parties are legally represented and whether there have been other forms of inquiry into the death in question. Those various criteria can feed into the question of whether the individual inquest is considered to be exceptional and whether, in particular, article 2 of the European Convention would require the state to provide exceptional funding if the next of kin could not afford their own representation.
Mr McGuckin: So, ordinarily, in the run of inquests, you would not necessarily expect somebody to have legal representation added in the nature of the event. The provision here is for very exceptional cases in which that is appropriate in order to get to the right outcome.
Mr McCartney: I have just one further question. I am sure that it is something that we will tease out. In what you would describe as a "normal" inquest, who represents the deceased? Obviously, the family represents the deceased. Would their representation be provided by the coroners' office?
Mr Cullen: It would not provide representation at the hearing of the inquest. We do not speak for the Coroners Service. However, it has support staff who will assist the next of kin on any individual death and advise them on whether there will be an inquest and what the procedure will involve. As regards having representation at the hearing, in the great majority of inquests cases, as indeed the great majority of cases in the civil and criminal courts, the parties are not legally represented. When it is considered that the nature of the issues involved are particularly serious, such as when agents of the state were involved in the death or there are serious allegations of collusion, and in the other category of case that Mark referred to, such as particular hospital-death cases in disputed circumstances, and other cases of that nature, the scheme has been designed with the intention to provide funding for those exceptional cases where the coroner concerned may not be able to discharge the obligation on the state to carry out an effective investigation into the death without representation for the family.
As I said, we will provide the numbers retrospectively. The broad picture is that they are a small number of cases compared with the whole number of cases that are heard in the Coroners' Court each year.
Mr Elliott: Just for clarity, what was the answer to Mr Maginness' question about costs?
Mr Cullen: I am afraid we do not have those figures available today.
Mr Elliott: You will come back with them?
Mr Cullen: I am, of course, happy to provide them. They are separately maintained within the Legal Services Commission's financial records, broken down between criminal cases, different court tiers and civil cases. This is classed as a separate class of case, and we have those figures available.
Mr McCartney: I have just one technical question. In relation to clause 3 in the Legal Aid and Coroners’ Courts Bill, if the Department were to take a policy decision not to fund certain types of inquests, is that possible? Would the director be in a position to say that he thought that was unfair given the way the legislation is now going to be framed?
Mr Cullen: No. Categorically no. In our presentation and oral briefing to the Committee in relation the Bill if it is clearly understood, whether it is direction or guidance they sit under legislation. They cannot override that, whether that is primary or secondary legislation. The article 12A provision in the Bill to be inserted into the 2003 Order sets the legislation. The guidance or potentially a direction will sit under that.
The Chairperson: All right, gentlemen. Thank you very much.News & Analysis IMP8980D Crosspoint Data Switch IC Supports Voice, Data, and Video IMP8980D Crosspoint Data Switch IC Supports Voice, Data, and Video EE Times1/29/1997 08:00 PM EST Post a comment NO RATINGSLogin to Rate Tweet San Jose, CA--January 27, 1997--IMP Inc. (San Jose, CA) announced the CMOS IMP8980D 256 by 256 channel PCM Digital Crosspoint Switch integrated circuit for digital exchange, PBX, and Central Office applications. The CMOS device switches digital data streams such as Pulse Code Modulated voice, video, or data signals. The IMP8980D establishes a path between any input and output over the internal ST-BUS. The IMP8980D has eight each ST-BUS input and output pins. By using time division multiplexing, the component level 2,048 kbit per second ST-BUS supports 32 logical data channels at 64 kbits per second at each device input and output pin. ST-BUS bit rate is divided into 8,000 frames with 32 channels per frame. Two operating modes exist. In Message mode the system microcontroller can pass information onto an output channel. In the non-blocking Switching mode, the output can specify its input channel data source. Multiple outputs can share an input; this is useful in message broadcast applications. A system microprocessor makes switched connections, writes data to output channels, and can receive data from input channels. In addition, the system microcontroller can concurrently read input channel data and write data to ST-BUS channel outputs. Large logical switch structures are possible since the IMP8980D can set outputs into a high impedance state on a per channel basis. Pricing for the 44-pin PLCC IMP8980DP and 40-pin DIP IMP8980DE starts at $7.70 in 1,000 piece quantities. Production quantities and samples are available now. IMP 2830 N.

Must a lack of incest, addiction, murder, and shocking secrets guarantee a rocky road to readership for a memoir? Not in the case of Diane Johnson’s “Flyover Lives,’’ where solid Midwestern values seasoned by charm, affection, and lovely writing provide a welcome detour off the tabloid path.
Curious to discover how a worldly writer evolved from small-town ancestors, Johnson, a novelist known for her send-up of Americans in Paris (“Le Divorce,’’ “Le Mariage,’’ “L’Affaire’’), decides to begin her exploration with the prairie women of her family who “didn’t have the leisure to pick up their pens.” She hopes to understand her connection to those pioneers, the pull of home — Moline, Ill. — and the equally strong desire to escape it.
A house party in France ignites the book’s first spark. Americans have no interest in history, a French friend accuses. Though other guests pose the standard queries — how long can a novel take? Does Johnson use a computer? — it’s the questions about her ancestors that stump her. She determines to find out more about her forebears and Moline. “[H]ow indeed could I ever become a writer? We were Default Americans, plump, mild, and Protestant, people whose ancestors had come ashore God knew when and had lost interest in keeping track of the details.”
The gauntlet thrown, Johnson researches family members who joined the vast migration to the Midwest in the 18th and 19th centuries. Through letters, documents, and diaries, she traces marriages, religious conversions, childbearing, and deaths. (Of the nine babies one ancestor delivers, only two survive.) She records the painting, quilting, canning, sewing, candle-making, laundering — chores all undertaken amid hordes of household guests, often with “a dying relative upstairs.” Yet, despite such toil, Johnson sees “happy women leading useful lives.”
She recalls her happy childhood with devoted parents who also lead useful lives. Memories unfurl of football games and dances, her father’s woodworking, her mother’s sewing, Saturday mornings at the library, summers on the lake, stewardess ambitions.
Her many uncles improve her vocabulary, give her a Brownie camera, and an amethyst from India, their only scorn directed toward a hairdresser sister-in-law, who displayed a 3-D rendering of “The Last Supper’’ in her living room, “a personal humiliation that such an error of taste could arise in my family whose walls . . . were hung with slightly amateurish oil paintings and watercolors by grandmothers and aunts — refinements the women in the family thought important.”
At college in Missouri, Johnson wins a month’s internship at Mademoiselle along with the daunting and impeccably pageboyed Sylvia Plath. “She was Literature up a notch from anything that had occurred to me.” Ever the country mouse, Johnson finds New York scary, “especially the gravelly voiced women editors who smoked and looked at the world through narrowed eyes, so unlike the moms of Moline.”
She leaves school to marry, has children, guilty they’re not the “totally absorbing joy” the 1950s demanded. When she finally starts to write, she tells no one because “the testimony of many writers’ families — usually male writers — convinced me it wasn’t good for children to have a writer parent.”
Fears notwithstanding, she builds a career, struggling to gain confidence in her work. As a screenwriter in Los Angeles, she hangs out with Mike Nichols, Volker Schlöndorff, Francis Ford Coppola, James Ivory, watches the filming of “Le Divorce,’’ works with Stanley Kubrick on “The Shining.’’ Delightful anecdotes abound.
Though Johnson portrays her childhood as unremarkable, her adulthood is complicated: post partum depression, a physically abusive husband, an affair with a married man, a yellow sports car she can’t afford, a remarriage, the conflicting claims of children and writing. These she touches on lightly, no headlines or fraught exposition. While her ancestors’ hardships weren’t her own, she acknowledges common bonds.
By the end, because so much lies between the lines, I wanted more. Perhaps I’m one of those Americans the French might disdain as indifferent to history, but — mea culpa — I confess that Johnson’s ancestors were far less compelling to me than Johnson herself. Others may disagree. What’s certain, however, is the absolute pleasure of being in the company of a skilled writer who so eloquently examines the people and geography that shaped her.Mameve Medwed has published five novels; her essays and reviews have appeared in The New York Times, Gourmet, Washington Post, among others.

CLERK of the supreme court, court of appeals and tax court ATTORNEY FOR APPELLANT: ATTORNEYS FOR APPELLEE: DONALD R. SHULER GREGORY F. ZOELLER Barkes, Kolbus & Rife, LLP Attorney General of Indiana Goshen, Indiana KARL M. SCHARNBERG Deputy Attorney General Indianapolis, Indiana IN THE COURT OF APPEALS OF INDIANA CORY DEVONN BEAVERS, ) ) Appellant-Defendant, ) ) vs. ) No. 20A03-0911-CR-523 ) STATE OF INDIANA, ) ) Appellee-Plaintiff. ) APPEAL FROM THE ELKHART CIRCUIT COURT The Honorable Terry C. Shewmaker, Judge Cause No. 20C01-0811-FA-52 May 13, 2010 MEMORANDUM DECISION - NOT FOR PUBLICATION VAIDIK, Judge Case Summary Cory Devonn Beavers appeals his two convictions for Class A felony dealing in cocaine and aggregate sentence of forty-five years. He contends that the evidence is insufficient to support his convictions. He also contends that the trial court abused its discretion in sentencing him, his sentence is inappropriate, and Indiana should recognize the doctrine of sentencing entrapment. Finding the evidence sufficient to support his convictions, no abuse of discretion in sentencing, that Beavers has failed to persuade us that his sentence is inappropriate, and that Indiana does not recognize the doctrine of sentencing entrapment, we affirm. Facts and Procedural History On November 5, 2008, a cooperating source, identified at trial as CS99023 (“CS”), contacted an undercover officer, identified at trial as UC193 (“UC”), with the Elkhart County Interdiction and Covert Enforcement Unit and told him that he could buy two eight balls of cocaine from an individual known to him only as “T.” UC met with CS and searched him to confirm that he had no money or contraband on his person. UC then gave CS $300 in pre-recorded buy money and fitted him with an audio recording device. CS called T and arranged to meet him at a Kroger parking lot in Elkhart. Before the meeting, however, T moved the meeting place to Stevens Avenue, which was a few blocks away. UC drove CS to the meeting place in his van and parked near a street light. Shortly after they parked, a green car arrived. T exited the passenger side of the green car. CS exited the van and met T in the middle of Stevens Avenue. T was upset because CS had brought UC, whom he did not know, to the exchange, but CS assured T 2 that it was okay. CS and T then walked to the passenger side of the van, where CS handed T the $300 and T handed CS cocaine packaged in three baggies. The cocaine was later weighed and totaled 3.18 grams. CS entered the van, and T returned to the green car. CS then handed the cocaine to UC, and they drove to another location, where UC again searched CS and found no money or contraband. On November 10, CS again contacted UC and told him that he could buy two more eight balls of cocaine from T. As before, CS called T and arranged to meet him at Kroger. UC searched CS and gave him $300 of pre-recorded buy money. Again, T changed the meeting place to a different intersection on Stevens Avenue. UC and CS were the first to arrive and parked the van near a street light. A red truck arrived shortly thereafter. T exited the passenger side of the truck and walked directly to UC in the driver’s seat of the van. UC rolled down his window, and T reached across UC to hand CS cocaine. The cocaine was later weighed and totaled 5.04 grams. CS handed T the $300, and T left. CS then gave the cocaine to UC, and they drove to a separate location, where UC again searched CS and found no money or contraband. After further investigation, the State charged Beavers with two counts of Class A felony dealing in cocaine. Ind. Code § 35-48-4-1(a)(1)(C), (b)(1) (three grams or more). The initial charging information, however, lists the defendant as “Darrell E. Phillips” because Beavers provided a false name to the police. His true name was not discovered until a December 2008 pretrial conference. The charging information was then amended to reflect his real name. A jury trial was held in August 2009, during which both UC and 3 CS identified Beavers as the person who sold them the cocaine. Beavers was found guilty as charged. At the sentencing hearing, the trial court identified the following aggravators: (1) Beavers has two misdemeanor convictions in Michigan as well as one misdemeanor conviction which is considered a felony under Indiana law; (2) there are between two and four bench warrants for Beavers’ arrest, and he has three pending cases; (3) Beavers committed this offense while on probation in Michigan; (4) Beavers used a false name to hinder the investigation in this case and has used the same false name in Ohio and Michigan; (5) there is at least one hold on Beavers from another jurisdiction; (6) Beavers is a gang member; and (7) Beavers gave false information to the preparer of his Presentence Investigation Report, which required corroboration and postponement of his sentencing hearing. The court identified the following mitigators: (1) Beavers’ age of twenty-six years and (2) all statements of Beavers and his counsel. The court indicated it would have been willing to consider Beavers’ addiction issues as a mitigator; however, Beavers said he had none. The trial court sentenced Beavers to forty-five years on each count and ordered the sentences to be served concurrently. The court ordered the sentence in this case to be served consecutive to any sentence imposed by the trial court in Saginaw County, Michigan. Beavers now appeals. Discussion and Decision Beavers raises several issues on appeal, which we reorder as follows. First, he contends that the evidence is insufficient to support his convictions for dealing in cocaine. Second, he contends that the trial court abused its discretion in sentencing him. 4 Third, he contends that his sentence is inappropriate. Finally, he contends that Indiana should recognize the doctrine of sentencing entrapment. I. Sufficiency of the Evidence Beavers contends that the evidence is insufficient to support both of his dealing in cocaine convictions because the “evidence fails to establish Beavers as the individual actually perpetrating these crimes.” Appellant’s Br. p. 8. When reviewing the sufficiency of the evidence, appellate courts must only consider the probative evidence and reasonable inferences supporting the verdict. Drane v. State, 867 N.E.2d 144, 146 (Ind. 2007). It is the fact-finder’s role, not that of appellate courts, to assess witness credibility and weigh the evidence to determine whether it is sufficient. Id. To preserve this structure, when appellate courts are confronted with conflicting evidence, they must consider it “most favorably to the trial court’s ruling.” Id. Appellate courts affirm the conviction unless “no reasonable fact-finder could find the elements of the crime proven beyond a reasonable doubt.” Id. at 146-47 (quotation omitted). It is therefore not necessary that the evidence “overcome every reasonable hypothesis of innocence.” Id. at 147 (quotation omitted). “[T]he evidence is sufficient if an inference may reasonably be drawn from it to support the verdict.” Id. (quotation omitted). In order to convict Beavers of dealing in cocaine, the State had to prove that he knowingly or intentionally delivered three or more grams of cocaine. I.C. § 35-48-4- 1(a)(1)(C), (b)(1). The only element Beavers challenges on appeal is identity. Although both UC and CS identified Beavers at trial as the person who delivered 3.18 and 5.04 grams of cocaine on November 5 and 10, 2008, Beavers argues on appeal that the 5 controlled buys occurred in the evening when the lighting conditions were poor, Beavers was wearing a hooded sweatshirt, and the controlled buys were short in duration. Beavers also notes that neither the green car nor the red truck were registered to him and the phone he used did not trace back to him. We find that these arguments are simply an invitation to reweigh the evidence, which we will not do. Two witnesses who personally interacted with Beavers identified him as the person who delivered the cocaine. UC and CS were present on both November 5 and 10. On both occasions, UC was careful to park near a street light. On November 5, Beavers and CS engaged in a heated discussion in the middle of the street before the exchange occurred because Beavers was upset that CS had brought along somebody he did not know. This prolonged the buy and the ability to observe Beavers. In addition, CS had interacted with Beavers three times before these controlled buys, including going on a walk with Beavers and his pit bull. And on November 10, Beavers reached across UC in the van to hand CS the cocaine and had a brief exchange with UC. As for some of Beavers’ other arguments, the evidence shows that Beavers was a passenger in both cars, so it is of little significance that the vehicles were not registered to him. In addition, UC testified that it is not uncommon for drug dealers to use other people’s phones to transact drug deals. The evidence is sufficient to prove that Beavers is the one who delivered three or more grams of cocaine on both November 5 and 10, 2008. II. Sentencing A. Abuse of Discretion 6 Beavers contends that the trial court abused its discretion in sentencing him to forty-five years, which is fifteen years above the advisory sentence for a Class A felony, for each count of dealing in cocaine. or the reasonable, probable, and actual deductions to be drawn therefrom. Id. We review the presence or absence of reasons justifying a sentence for an abuse of discretion, but we cannot review the relative weight given to these reasons. Id. at 491. We first note that Beavers’ abuse of discretion argument acknowledges the trial court’s long list of aggravators set forth in the facts section above. Significantly, he does not argue that any of the aggravators are improper or that the court failed to find any mitigators. Rather, he simply argues that there was nothing extraordinary about these controlled buys that warrant an above-advisory sentence. Beavers’ short argument on this issue, see Appellant’s Br. p. 19-20, is basically a veiled attempt to reweigh the aggravators and mitigators that the court did find. Anglemyer prohibits this. We thus proceed to address Beavers’ inappropriate sentence argument. B. Inappropriate Sentence Although a trial court may have acted within its lawful discretion in imposing a sentence, Article 7, Sections 4 and 6 of the Indiana Constitution authorize independent appellate review and revision of sentences through Indiana Appellate Rule 7(B), which 7 provides that a court “may revise a sentence authorized by statute if, after due consideration of the trial court’s decision, the Court finds that the sentence is inappropriate in light of the nature of the offense and the character of the offender.” Reid v. State, 876 N.E.2d 1114, 1116 (Ind. 2007) (citing Anglemyer, 868 N.E.2d at 491). The burden is on the defendant to persuade us that his or her sentence is inappropriate. Id. (citing Childress v. State, 848 N.E.2d 1073, 1080 (Ind. 2006)). As for the nature of the offenses, Beavers argues that they are simply run-of-the- mill controlled buys, involving neither weapons nor violence, committed by a mid-level dealer. We agree. However, Beavers’ character speaks volumes and supports his aggregate sentence of forty-five years. At the time of the offenses in this case, Beavers, twenty-six years old, had accumulated misdemeanor convictions in Michigan for malicious destruction of personal property (2000) and domestic battery (2001 and 2005). According to the trial court, the 2005 conviction is considered a felony under Indiana law. In addition, Beavers was on probation for the 2005 conviction at the time of the offenses in this case. A probation violation petition and bench warrant were subsequently issued in Michigan. Finally, Beavers had charges pending against him in Saginaw County, Michigan (felony robbery, misdemeanor domestic violence), and Defiance, Ohio (burglary, fraud, possession of cocaine—all felonies), at the time of the instant offenses. Appellant’s App. p. 120. The record shows that Beavers routinely uses a false name to hamper investigative efforts. Indeed, he gave a false name to the police when he was arrested and booked in 8 this case. It was not until a December 2008 pretrial conference that he provided his real name. He also used this name in Michigan and Ohio. At an earlier sentencing hearing in this case, Beavers gave the trial court false information about his criminal history in Michigan and Ohio. The court stated, “And I am particularly disturbed by the fact, Mr. Beavers, that it appears under one scenario that you did, in fact, attempt to mislead the Court as to your identity, as to your criminal history, and as to the existence of outstanding warrants for your arrest, and the Court takes a dim view of that.” Tr. p. 296. Beavers’ easy recourse to dishonesty speaks poorly of his character. Instead of facing up to his crimes, Beavers has fled at least two jurisdictions and used a false name to evade efforts to locate him. In the process, he has managed to commit two Class A felonies in this state. Beavers has failed to persuade us that his sentence is inappropriate. C. Sentencing Entrapment Finally, Beavers contends that Indiana should recognize the federal sentencing doctrine of sentencing entrapment and apply it to the facts of his case. Sentencing entrapment occurs in situations when a defendant who lacks a predisposition to engage in more serious crimes nevertheless does so as a result of “unrelenting government persistence.” United States v. White, 519 F.3d 342, 347 (7th Cir. 2008), reh’g and reh’g en banc denied. This doctrine has apparently been used in some of the federal circuits to authorize a sentence reduction in cases where the defendant, while predisposed to commit a lesser offense, is entrapped into committing a greater offense subject to greater punishment. See United States v. Staufer, 38 F.3d 1103, 1106 (9th Cir. 1994). But see United States v. Sanchez, 138 F.3d 1410, 1414 (11th Cir. 1998) (rejecting sentencing 9 entrapment defense). Beavers argues that there is no evidence “in the record to establish that [he] was predisposed to deal in amounts of cocaine greater than three (3) grams, the threshold amount separating a Class B Felony from a Class A Felony.” Appellant’s Br. p. 21. Indiana does not recognize this doctrine, and given the differences between the federal sentencing guidelines and our own system, Beavers provides no compelling reason why we should do so. Rather, under our system, the details surrounding the offense are properly considered under the nature of the offense prong of an inappropriate sentence analysis. Here, we properly considered that Beavers was a mid-level drug dealer and that these were State-sponsored buys. And as for Beavers’ argument that he was not inclined to deal over the threshold amount of three grams, he provides absolutely no evidence of that. We decline Beavers’ invitation to recognize this doctrine when Indiana law adequately addresses his concern in our Appellate Rule 7(B) analysis. Affirmed. NAJAM, J., and BROWN, J., concur. 10

Knowing it may or may not be a traffic snafu there, the Militant rode on his bike and was able to get in and out in a flash (if you saw a bike riding though the Dodger Stadium parking lot - it may or may not be the Militant himself)!
After riding in the main Sunset Gate where is voucher was scanned, he followed the auto traffic to a spot at Dodger Stadium Lot 3 near the Golden State Gate, where he ran into a section of the lot divided into several lanes by traffic cones. The first person he met asked to see his voucher and put a golden wristband on his arm. Yes, he has to wear this thing for the next 19 hours and use it to gain entry into the cordoned-off area surrounding Staples Center. A second wristband was handed over to him.
Duh. So the Militant rode his bike to the end of the lane, where they took his voucher printout, tore it up, discarded it in a recycling bin and handed him a pair of purple tickets for the event.
Score! (Seat location and barcode pixelated out to maintain the Militant's anonymity in top picture)
As a long queue of cars waited to exit the Golden State Gate, the Militant rode on through on his bike, unencumbered. So long, suckas!
Now, the Militant knows what you're all thinking. "What's the deal with MJ, MA? It's soooo mainstream. Have you sold out?"
The Militant admits Michael Jackson is as far from the Militant as one can get (well, actually, not quite). He's never been to a Michael Jackson concert, never had a glitter glove, never had Michael Jackson posters in his room,
But the Militant, in his 30somethingness, can't deny MJ played a large role in his '80s music memories. He does own three unspecified Michael Jackson albums, two of them are on vinyl LP (You can pretty much take a wild guess at what one of them is). And the day the "Thriller" video came out, it was nonetheless a cultural event the day the Militant's dad came home from The Wherehouse and popped the tape into the old Betamax (The Militant certainly hopes no pictures of a 12 year-old Militant in a red zipper jacket ever surface).
But in the interest of Militancy, the Militant sees it this way: On Tuesday, July 7, 2009, the entire world's eyes will be focused on Los Angeles. At least for a few hours (again). we can lay claim to being the center of the world. In an age where collective consciousness is splintered into various niches, thanks to the Internet and specialized media, it's a rare sight to see such a major cultural event take place, the Militant will be there to witness it, and it's right here in our backyards.
The Militant will, of course, either be riding his bike or riding the (M)etro there. If you're going to the memorial at Staples Center Tuesday and don't, not only will you suck, but you're gonna make millions of other people's lives suck as well. The Militant can never suck!
The Militant will be Twittering (depending on signal quality) from Staples Center! Follow him at!

At the temple Heather claims she has found The Zen and is changing her religion from BuJew (Buddhist jew) to HinJew (Hindu-Jew) – is she working her way through all the religions to see which one is most forgiving of two-faced bitchiness! Shannon swoons about the masterful spiritual awakening she experienced because she gets The Zen. She lives The Zen; embodies it and it shines through her pores like a crystal deodorant in reverse. Tamra doesn’t get The Zen and thinks it’s a cocktail. She has The Evil Eye though – does that count?! Vicki found her Zen at an insurance conference many Dr. Moons ago, so she’s good!.
The New Gals change clothes to give the illusion of conformity, Shannon put on a dress one might wear to high tea. Tamra complains about potentially being gang raped in Bali by monkeys – too bad she’s about to be ganged up on over cocktails and what is possibly fried monkey mousse! #Foreshadowing Vicki and Tamra flee and hide in the bathroom where they discover toilet paper is a western concept. Vicki needs to just start wearing Depends.
As they shop in the local market, Vicki reaffirms the dumbness of Lizzie and Mute, who allow the vendors to take advantage of them. They were probably just having fun, but to Vicki money is a Goddess who needs worshipping. Vicki probably has a specially made crown of Benjamins which she wears at night to chant in front of her shrine of insurance documents.
Then they get fish pedicures and the fish swarm Tamra (because she’s dead inside?), Heather is so perfectly taut with Botox there is no loose skin for the fish to eat. Shannon is petrified of fish and freaks out that they touch her. Vicki just ran through the market screaming, “Insurance!”
The next day the ladies break into groups: Heather and Tamra go for a bike ride to explore Bali, Shannon and Vicki go to a spa for holistic heaven, Mute and Lizzie decide to sit by the pool to plot and plan their mutiny against Tamra. Lizzie and Danielle seemed to be having the least amount of fun – was it because Danielle is so invisible Lizzie couldn’t tell if she was talking to the pool liner or her friend?
After being crystaled, Shannon tells Vicki that Tamra has been a bad friend. And Holistic Heaven goes to Holistic Hell in one coconut water and a hibiscus facial spray. Not only has Tamra been trashing Brooks behind Vicki’s back, she’s been complaining about Vicki as well. Vicki is speechless and looks legit hurt. She thought Tamra was her friend again (despite the fact that she was talking about her to Lizzie a couple weeks ago!) and is disgusted to learn that Tamra cannot be trusted. “There’s a darkness inside of her,” Vicki informs us.
Back at the pool Shannon and Vicki meet up with Lizzie and Mute for cocktails. Liquid courage, gals! In a gossip catharsis that leaves no nasty stone unturned, Shannon is regaled with stories of even more dreadful things Tamra said about her that led Lizzie and Danielle to avoid her. Not only is Shannon crazy and being entertained little green martians in her head, but she needs a colonic she’s so full of bullshit, and an exorcism couldn’t even save her. And speaking of being saved, Tamra has been regaling all the ladies with scandalous stories of Shannon’s marriage. Oh – and Vicki is next – Tamra still doesn’t accept Brooks. Vicki is just mouth agape staring at the ground, with fish eyes. Shannon hates fish, Vicki – look out!
Heather and Tamra explore rice paddies – Tamra thought rice grew on trees, so she learned something new and she’s about to learn even more new information – like everyone is wise to her antics!
Before dinner Shannon thanks Heather for including her in the trip, and apologies – again – for all their drama. It seemed as if Heather was going to accept but as soon as they sat down she confronts Shannon with some bogus nonsense of the time at her Hoedown that Shannon’s husband told her to spread her legs before getting on the mechanical bull. Apparently Terrry is sooooooo furiously mad it took him months and months to speak of the horrible matter. Or maybe his memory frozen with Botox?
Shannon is like oh shit – not this again. She wisely doesn’t take the bait and orders another drink, besides – there’s an agenda: the Tamra drama supersedes.
Things get weird – there is lots of awkward silence. Vicki is silent as Mute (I KNOW, RIGHT?!) and is just staring straight ahead to keep from crying. Tamra tries to speak to her using some weird telepathy but it’s hard to decipher anything when neither of their faces move! Finally Tamra leaves for the bathroom and Vicki spills to Heather that Tamra has been trashing Brooks, lying to her face, and basically being untrustworthy. Again. Vicki feels their friendship is over.
And then bam! Shannon calls Tamra out for her backstabbing betrayals, constant lies, and talking about her to everyone in the group. She also thinks Tamra made up the ‘Take down the Beadors’ comment. Shannon was calm but firm. Tamra blamed Lizzie and Mute for revealing what she said and that Shannon drinks too much. She brings up ‘Marry, Shag, Kill’ again and accuses Lizzie of making the ‘Eddie wants to eff me’ comment, which Lizzie denies, but Heather insists Lizzie said.
Lizzie tells Tamra she is “such crap” and has just been trying to manipulate everyone. Tamra gets madder and madder because well, Lizzie is beating her at her own game: calling her out, not backing down, confronting her with verbal jabs. “You’re the most insecure woman I’ve ever met,” Lizzie snaps.
Tamra responds by fleeing the table. No one goes after her, which speaks volumes. And Lizzie knows she has won. But she is not done yet – Shannon issues the final blow. Shannon tells Heather that even she is not immune from Tamra’s vicious tongue, as Tamra told her they weren’t truly friends and that Heather was only in her wedding for the show. Oh and she told Mute (she speaks!) that Heather is anorexic. Heather tears up, looks down at her plate of congealed Balinese delicacy and she sniffles that she’s hurt.
One thing we can thank Tamra for is that she rendered Vicki silent (Mute 2.0!). Vicki is just so hurt she’ll never recover. Heather goes to check on Tamra, finally, and Tamra denies it all, blames Lizzie for fabricating an attack, and says again that Shannon is crazy. Still – she is most upset with Vicki.
Heather is only there to confirm she hasn’t been played for the fool, that Tamra didn’t take down the Dubrows by selling a snake oil friendship. “But you love me, don’t you?” Heather pleads. Of course Tamra does – Heather is her only frienemy left! Oh Heather… if it walks like a bitch, talks like a bitch, lies like a bitch – she’s probably Tamra.
No one is feeling forgiving towards Tamra and Vicki is STILL pretty much silent, but Lizzie is the cat that ate the canary and Shannon looks shocked at her own gumption. Heather thinks they should just wait to deal with it until they get back to the OC. Don’t they have a 30 hour plane ride together?
You know Tamra was caught on tape saying all the horrible things about Shannon, making the comments about Brooks, but I don’t know – do we believe all of Lizzie’s tales? Is Lizzie an evil genius (has Tamra met her match?!) or is Tamra just a really horrible person?
Heather wanted an experience that was indigenous to Bali, too bad she got one that is only indigenous to Housewives: The Vacation From Hell! No matter what the location.

tracetcp is a command line traceroute utility for WIN32 that uses TCP SYN packets rather than ICMP/UDP packets that the usual implementations use, thus bypassing gateways that block traditional traceroute packets.
In addition to providing the functionality of the standard traceroute utility tracetcp allows a trace to be performed over any TCP port. This allows the discovery of what ports a filewall blocks and also the presence of any transparent proxies that have been put in place.

'Fierce Green Fire' showcases 50 years of environmentalism
- Article by: Colin Covert
- Star Tribune
- April 11, 2013 - 2:49 PM
American naturalist Aldo Leopold wrote of an unexpected encounter with a wolf in his 1948 collection of outdoor essays “A Sand County Almanac.” He instinctively pulled out his rifle and shot the animal. As he stood beside the dying wolf, he saw in her eyes “a fierce green fire.” Her death was a sort of birth for Leopold, the awakening of his ecological consciousness.
The new documentary “A Fierce Green Fire” is a big-picture history of the American environmental movement and its global offshoots. It is a celebration, a critique and a call to action. Watching it, you hope your grandchildren will not be viewing it one day from inside their climate survival pods.
Mark Kitchell’s film ranges from the early conservation era of John Muir, through Rachel Carson’s focus on environmental toxins and regulation in the early 1960s, and the rise of the Sierra Club, but emphasizes iconic moments from the past half-century. This is advocacy filmmaking, if advocating the continued health of our planet warrants that description.
It is less partisan than you might expect. The film approvingly shows the portion of President Richard Nixon’s 1970 State of the Union address dealing with America’s pollution crisis. “Shall we surrender?” he asked. “Or shall we make our peace with nature and begin to make reparations for the damage we have done to our air, to our land, and to our water?” The film reminds us that Nixon created the Environmental Protection Agency and impelled Congress to draw up the Endangered Species Act. It shows President Obama vacillating over the carbon-limiting Kyoto Protocol in 2009.
Kitchell plods through this worthy material. Where Jeff Orlowski’s Oscar-nominated 2012 documentary “Chasing Ice” dramatized dying glaciers with compelling you-are-there images, Kitchell trots out the standard array of archival photos, news footage and talking heads. Earnest narrators, including Robert Redford, Meryl Streep, Ashley Judd and Isabel Allende, don’t add much excitement.
When Kitchell introduces engaging people on the front lines, the film’s pulse spikes. There’s real drama in the retelling of New York’s Love Canal catastrophe. Lois Gibbs and her fellow housewives took EPA officials hostage to force the government to move their families away from a toxic dump that caused children to be born with extra ears, double rows of teeth, and superfluous fingers.
The tragedy of agriculture organizer Chico Mendes, murdered for rallying rubber-tappers to save Brazil’s Amazon rain forests, hits like a punch in the gut. The ideological split between Greenpeace pacifists and a militant, piratical offshoot that rammed and sabotaged whaling vessels is a gripping yarn. In Kitchell’s presentation, alas, they are brief, rousing sections in a humdrum lecture.

Stormbreaker - Review
Review by Jack Foley
THE name’s Rider, Alex Rider and while this young James Bond’s exploits may leave younger fans shaken, adults might not feel quite so stirred.
Based upon the ultra-successful novels by Anthony Horowitz, Stormbreaker could well become a franchise to rival the Harry Potter series if it plays its cards right. But on the evidence of his first outing, the jury is very much out.
Director Geoffrey Sax gives it his best shot, courtesy of a cracking ensemble cast and some smart set pieces, but the film feels hopelessly uneven given its uneasy mix of juvenile humour and potentially more serious situations.
Leading man, Alex Pettyfer, also upsets the flow, acquitting himself capably enough during the action sequences but emerging as way too bland to really convince as a charismatic superspy in waiting.
The film picks up energetically enough as the uncle/guardian (Ewan McGregor) of Alex Rider (Pettyfer) is killed mid-mission while investigating the shady affairs of evil businessman Darrius Sayle (Mickey Rourke).
Alex is subsequently recruited by two government spooks (Billy Nighy and Sophie Okonedo) to finish the job and infiltrate Sayle’s network, posing as a super-nerd to get the lowdown on a potentially lethal new computer system.
In so doing, the young agent uncovers a plot to assassinate the Prime Minister (Robbie Coltrane), while underlining his credentials as a future spy in the making.
But while young fans of Horowitz’s novels may well be hooked by Stormbreaker’s energetic style, given the talent that’s been assembled older viewers may feel somewhat cheated.
Many of the established stars seem content to ham it up rather than act, which contributes to the sloppy tone, while Rourke lacks any real menace as the villain and fails to present a worthy adversary.
For every set piece that works (such as a climactic chase through the streets of London involving a Mini and some horses), there are several that don’t, including one ill-judged confrontation between Missi Pyle and Alicia Silverstone that’s juxtaposed with the action taking place in a cartoon.
Even some of the humour feels strained and obvious, particularly in the way that it parodies 007 and Austin Powers while virtually winking at the older audience.
Hence, the lighter side of the film is completely at odds with the more serious themes it puts forward, such as the loss of father figures and the effects of bullying. There’s simply no consistency.
On the plus side, Sax keeps things moving at a lively pace and makes good use of his London locations. And there are some nice supporting performances from the likes of Nighy (excellent as ever), Stephen Fry (as a glib Q equivalent) and Damien Lewis (as an assassin).
An open ending also suggests there’s plenty of room for improvement should the box office set up the possibility of a franchise.
It’s just that for all its hard work and endeavour, Stormbreaker doesn’t really blow you away as impressively as it should.

This is a very good article and I love all the Alex Rider books.heather Day Jul 28 #With.
Fact is that we have have four full functional electronic chart systems on board - two computers that run Transas Navigator and Open CPN software, plus two iPads running Navionics HD and various other charting or mapping apps. How much redundancy do we need ? What could cause all four of those systems to fail at the same time ? Nothing short of a nuclear holocaust or perhaps a major meteor strike I think.
So, should we continue to carry around hundreds and hundreds of paper charts, most of which are inevitably out of date and not corrected ?
How Do They Compare ?
We probably obtained this from a merchant ship that was clearing old charts, though we have some that came from military ships as well.
The second deficiency is accuracy. That That Fiji chart that i selected was first published in 1878, with large corrections in 1915, 1939 and 1962.
There were further small corrections published through to 1988, when my copy was originally purchased.
However when I compare it to the information available on Transas Navigator or Open CPN there is simply no way that I would want to work with that paper chart. I found the same issues with many other old charts that I reviewed. They are beautiful works of art, but too much information is simply missing, unless you carry every detailed chart on issue.
Another ComparisonHere is Ascension Island, a tiny dot in the South Atlantic. In the North west corner is Clarence Bay, the subject of this comparison. You can click on these images to enlarge them.
Here is the same area from our Transas Navigator charts. Very few soundings in the harbour, though it has enough detail to support prudent navigation. I think the Transas chart is showing its "big ship" heritage here.
The real surprise is the data found in the Navionics HD package on iPad. Good detail on the harbour right into shallow water, mooring buoys shown. lead lines etc. Here is Navionics showing they understand the needs of small boat operators.
So some paper charts have more shore line detail and sounding density than any of our electronic versions, but that detail is usually beyond what we need.
Our Decision
For years we've lived lived by the policy that we would always have detailed paper chart coverage, to backup the electronic systems onboard.
Now we've decided to carry only large scale paper charts that provide oceanic coverage, perhaps over several sheets, for use in passage planning and as emergency plotting aids. The result is that we've been able to remove a stack of charts almost eight inched high ! Most of course have gone to good homes on other boats.
No GPS - How About Glonass Then ?
It is a frequent topic of conversation among cruising sailors, but I'm guessing that 99% of us would be in serious trouble if the GPS satellite system failed (or was turned off) during an ocean passage. How good are your sextant skills ? Probably better than mine I'd say.
B&G / Simrad / Lowrance) will provide a position fix from the GPS satellite system, but also from the Russian Glonass system, and from the European Galileo system, providing a large degree of redundancy. Other manufacturers will surely follow.
I was also impressed to see that the latest iPad and iPad Mini also feature Glonass sensors, to supplement the standard GPS positioning system.
iPad WiFi - No GPS
Finally, a word of caution for sailors who are contemplating an iPad purchase. Over the past few weeks I've run a number of informal iPad training sessions for cruising folk here at Yacht Haven Marina. Unfortunately more than one couple has purchased a wi-fi only version of the iPad, which has no GPS positioning system - it cannot work properly with any marine navigation App.
If you want to use the iPad for navigation you must buy the model that has 3G/4G network compatibility. Only those models have the necessary position sensors.
If you do unfortunately have the wi-fi only version, you can easily add GPS compatibility to the unit by using the Bad Elf external GPS module. Two versions are available, one with cable connection and the other using BlueTooth.
6 comments:
Our decision about paper vs electronic charts was the same as yours, only we got rid of a 12" stack of charts, one of the heaviest and bulkiest items on the boat.
Now, however, in addition to the large scale charts we try to carry a cruising guide, (Hardcopy) of the areas we will be visiting. At least with the chart, a magnetic compass, and the guide book we can get into a harbor and get new electronics, should the entire system some how get destroyed.
Now, also, with OpenCPN, we can use scanned versions of paper charts, should we find one we just can't part with, which can be added to our OpenCPN catalog of charts, and toggle back and forth from the vector to the scanned version: best of all worlds.
A couple of things to ad.
1. An issue to a lot of users in out of the way places is still resolving datum issues. Yes they still exist, in some data bases, areas that have not been converted to WGS84. Some electronic chart brands do this as well as they can, some not so well and all are constrained by the availability of source data. Using an electronic chart with the ability to overlay a satellite image is the most definitive way to have confidence, or otherwise in the datum of the coast line you are approaching.
It is easy to think that the chart you down loaded last week must be the latest and up to date. Do not be fooled. Some Chart brands are more proactive than others keeping things up to date but the most common reason for a chart being out of date is just simply that the up to date info is not available. Busy places get updated regularly. Out of the way places may get surveyed every blue moon. Reputable electronic chart systems generally have a way of showing the source data and its date which may vary from one area of a downloaded chart to another.
2.You mentioned the fact that a number of manufacturers now provide Glonas / GPS Hybrid receivers but failed to mention Garmin were first on the market with this and have combined it with a superfast 10htz processor allowing GPS derived heading and speed over the ground to be as good as you can get at speeds as low as 1 knot
Fred, thanks for sharing your approach. Pity I'm not able to scan everything before we dispose of it......
Thanks Robin, Appreciate your perspective on this. From our conversation yesterday, it seems that Garmin has the latest and best coverage in Indonesia. I'll be interested t hear from others on this issue.
I wanted to add a bit from our own personal experience with the iPad and Bad Elf. Though it's true it's a somewhat of a hassle to add a GPS dongle to the iPad every time you want to use your navigation app, the Bad Elf costs about the same amount as the difference in price between units and is said to do a MUCH better job of maintaining a signal. I can't speak to this directly because we have the wi-fi only iPad, but we have no complaints about the Bad Elf and once we lock into a signal, it there to stay!

Thanks Stephanie, those who have wi-if only iPads will be encouraged by your comments. I gather you are using the pro version of the Bad Elf, with Bluetooth connection ?.
Network
News: Another Corporate Rip-off
August 10, 2002
By Joseph Arrieta
I
recently underwent the net head's ultimate nightmare: marooned
in America without http. I was surrounded by refrigeration,
internal combustion, AC, electronics, telecommunications and
plumbing at my in-laws, but no computer.
There was no newspaper. I'd stumble into the living room
every morning desperate for news, only to face that ubiquitous
American device, that slimy slinger of imagery, shameless
purveyor of useless chatter, instigator of countless atrophied
minds and swelling asses: television.
I'm familiar with the technology, of course. Television brings
me the Oakland A's and Raiders, plus Jim Lehrer, for which
I'll always be profoundly grateful. Other than that I never
watch anything else.
From a public policy perspective, network television has
earned yet another negative moniker: rip-off!
Since the beginnings of television the major networks have
been given free spectrum space as long as
they performed a public service by broadcasting news every
night. That free ride has long deserved to be over. Calling
television journalism news is like calling a Big Mac food:
it seems genuine but only makes you sick.
Dan Rather was on the Lehrer News Hour early last year, remarkably
sanguine about the whipping his network executives were about
to get in Congress for the utter debacle of Election night
2000. "Well, we deserve it, " he said, chuckling.
Wrong answer, Dan. You've deserved it for a long time.
I found network news to be maddeningly incomplete and fundamentally
off mission. A story would run on the deficit but with no
reference to the crooked accounting that allowed the rationalization
for the tax cut to take place. There was endless blather about
a kidnapping/murder of a girl in California, but zero reference
to any trends in American child crime. I knew a lot of background
for the stories, and the network presentation was infuriatingly
consistent in its woeful shallowness.
Since when did American television journalism become so obsessed
with health issues? Obesity, diabetes, osteoporosis, some
killer Nile mosquito, asthma, Alzheimer's, an incredible amount
of yap about female hormone therapy (barf)--all received a
great amount of precious air time. Some viewers might be interested,
but this simply wasn't news.
Since network news was such a wasteland (22 minutes of almost
nothing), I turned to the Big Kahuna, the total news network,
CNN.
Amazingly, CNN has shattered their medium! What the hell
is that scrolling text at the bottom of the screen? I noticed
it after 9/11 when I walked by a bar and saw the TV on the
wall, but thought it was one of those optional side channel
feeds, like simultaneous Spanish broadcasts, that one could
choose to display.
Hello? Is CNN broadcasting imagery and sound-to watch-or
text, to read? I'd be reading a story and they'd break for
commercial, completely shutting off the text right in the
middle. Anybody home? Pick one medium, guys.
It got immediately worse. CNN constantly exhorted viewers
to go to their site and participate in their instant polling,
which they were always careful to state was "not scientific,"
meaning that these useless polls held no value. CNN seemed
completely unaware that they were deliberately steering their
viewers out of one medium (television) into another (the Internet)
for useless junk.
I was almost embarrassed for CNN. They'd blown the presentation
of their core medium and were steering their viewers right
into another. I guess it never occurred to them that viewers
would soon figure out these useless polls were pure pap, but
that the Internet offered endless fascination for even the
least curious person. Go, I mentally exhorted the viewers,
go and take that stupid instant poll, but keep that browser
fired up! Go, go, click the mouse away from that horrible
flashing box into the bit stream of ip!
Television news matters. Even if I blessedly never have to
watch the stuff again, roughly 50% of the country has no Internet
access and depend on it for one of the most vital elements
of democracy: an informed citizenry. If you don't agree, I'm
sure the folks at Media Whores Online
would like to have a little chat with you.
We can play an active role in improving network news, which
would also have a positive effect on CNN. Pass legislation
dictating all national network news broadcasts be one hour
in length with no more than 12 minutes of advertising. [1] If the networks refuse they can always cough up the spectrum
fees they've gotten such a free ride with. One billion dollars
annually.
Network news would have to adapt to a reporting/interview
model similar to the Lehrer News Hour, but with probably much
more reporting in the mix. If the topics aren't particularly
interesting the News Hour can be real sominex, but in the
past few years they've brought in excellent media and economic
reporters who file superlative stories, followed by expert
interviews. Now that's broadcast news.
I'll write to Gephardt, who will likely ignore it. Fine.
Some day some politician is going to figure out this rip-off
is an opportunity for votes that every citizen can immediately
understand.
Voters remember the debacle of Election 2000 and have flat-out
had it with corporate rip-offs. Dan Rather was right -- network
news does deserve a whipping. Time to pay up.
[1] Network ratings, along with network news, has been declining
steadily for years. Maybe if the networks actually delivered
value their ratings would go up. Duh!

North Koreans who escape their impoverished homeland by sneaking into neighboring China are in for a rude awakening once they cross the border.
The Chinese government does not recognize them as refugees. Rather, they are seen as economic migrants, and they are systematically sent back home – where they face the possibility of being shipped to one of North Korea’s notorious labor camps, tortured or even executed.
Justice for North Korea, an organization made up of both South Koreans and expats that was established in May 2007, hopes to raise awareness about those who risk their lives to escape the closed country.
One of the group’s regular activities involves a gripping performance held from 3 to 5 p.m. every Saturday on the main drag of Insa-dong, central Seoul, where a half-dozen members depict how severely defectors are treated by North Korean and Chinese soldiers.
“We basically have a small performance where one person dresses as a refugee and is tied with ropes and has a black cloth over her face and is kneeling down on the street,” said Lauren E. Walker, an English teacher who has been in Korea for just six months. .”
During the performance, group members display informational posters, distribute flyers to passersby and attempt to engage people about the issue. The group currently has 10 active members, and more than 170 people have joined its Facebook page.
“Expats who are involved often get asked, ‘You’re not Korean, why are you doing this?’” Walker said. “That’s a really great opportunity for us to say, ‘We live here in Korea and we feel that North Koreans are part of our families, too.’ We get the information to people and encourage dialogue with South Koreans and all other tourists and expats in the Insa-dong area.”
Dan Bielefeld, a member who came to Korea in 2006, said that a Korean boy approached him one time and asked in Korean, “Is this real?”
“I explained to him in my halting Korean what was going on, and he seemed interested,” Bielefeld said. “Many South Koreans are aware of the dire situation in North Korea, but I guess they don’t know the details. People I talked to were surprised, saying they didn’t know it was that serious.”
The group branches out into other areas as well. As part of its efforts to bolster awareness of North Korean defectors, it recently hosted a screening of the 2005 documentary film “Seoul Train” in an art gallery near Hongdae.
The film tells the story of a family that attempted to escape North Korea by going to the Japanese consulate in China. As they passed through the front gates, some of the family members were forcibly dragged out by the Chinese police.
The family eventually won asylum and arrived in Korea, helped by the vast media coverage that characterized the incident as inhumane. More than 40 people of various nationalities came to see the film, which was followed by a panel discussion with three people who have risked their lives to help North Koreans escape.
Tim Peters, an American Christian activist who runs the Seoul-based charity Helping Hands Korea, was one of them.
“Even though this film was made five years ago, the situation as it exists in China as far as North Korean refugees are concerned is almost completely unchanged,” Peters said during the discussion.
Pastor Peter Chung, the Korean founder of the group, said the majority of Justice for North Korea’s members are foreign nationals. Their involvement in this issue, he said, helps get the attention of locals.
“Their work reminds South Koreans that, hey, even foreigners are campaigning for North Korean human rights,” Chung said. “They think, ‘I’m a South Korean and I share the same blood with North Koreans and I should get more involved.’”
Chung, who studied abroad in China in 1998, witnessed heartbreaking scenes of poor North Korean defectors wandering around helplessly in China. He quit his studies and set up a shelter to help North Korean defectors. He was captured by Chinese guards and served jail term for his work.
For those who are interested in checking out the group’s activities or participating, search Facebook using the term “Rescue NK.”

"Soldotna High School and the science department is the team," Nolden said. "I feel humbled about the whole experience. Because I know all the teachers in my particular school and throughout the district are great teachers also. And why I'm singled out, I'm not really sure of the whole situation but I'm flattered."
The other teachers receiving the award from the Kenai Peninsula were Melissa Cloud and Shellie Worsforld of West Homer Elementary and 2012 Kenai Peninsula BP Teacher of the Year, Sean Campbell, of Homer High School.
Nolden's favorite aspect of being in the classroom is being around the students, he said.
"It's the whole deal about the kids being grateful to the teacher all the time," Nolden said.
In his 28 years of teaching, he's had numerous experiences with students that he's thankful for.
If he's not in the classroom, and it's winter time, Nolden can be found on the bench of the SoHi hockey team.
Whether it's hockey or biology or health, Nolden makes sure the students are learning something they can use outside of the classroom -- it's what makes him tick.
"The idea of learning and the idea of learning a concept and then being able to apply that to every day life, that's when the light bulb comes on and says 'OK, I get emphysema now,' it's that moment that says, 'OK now I know what that is,'" he said.
He tries to follow a pattern with his instruction. He'll have a lecture discussion, then switch gears to book assignments, then have an activity and then a review and then have a test on the subject.
"Those things vary from time to time but that's kind of the approach I take," Nolden said. "The reviews can be art or a digital presentation, they can vary, but it's kind of that initial format."
Nolden attributes a teacher enrichment pathway that he and his colleagues participated in as to what helped him continue success in the classroom.
This was Nolden's second time receiving the honor. Nolden said the collaboration between his fellow teachers was a big help in restructuring lesson plans.
"The idea of me winning this award, well I'm teaching a lot of the same material Chris Hanson is in his biology class and working with Dave Emery in his health class with the same types of materials," Nolden said.
Nolden said the award is a feather in the cap for his fellow teachers and the administration that supported them with evaluations of their material.
"I think it's the working together with our science department and under the directive from (Kenai Peninsula Borough School District) administration," he said.
The students must be hearing the messages Nolden is giving to them. That's what he strives for. If students ask him why are they learning about a particular topic, Nolden tells them how it applies to life.
"I'm always stressing why things are important, and I always challenge kids to ask me, 'Why do we need know this?' and hopefully I can give them an answer where they'll nod their head and say 'OK','" he said. "I guess that's the idea of the practicality of what you're learning, whether you go on to college or whether your interests bring you in an area other than science or college."

A1) Field testing of the windows will not be required. Include submittal data indicating the windows compliance. Q2) The specification gives a sq. ft. requirement of both office space and storage space and drawing C-100 shows quantity of trailers are we to assume that the office space is link together or are they separate units and can it be it be more then (6) to meet the requirements? A2) After researching standard configurations and locally available products, the requirement for temporary office trailers shall be two each, nominal 24x60 double wide office trailers and a one each, nominal 12 x 60 office trailer. This is a total of 3,600 SF. Q3) Under the specification 01-45 40 can the system be tested separate within the 60 day period or is each system to have a 60 day time frame? A3) I believe these requirements are clearly stated in the specification, but I will summarize them in this response. This response does not change the requirements of Section 01 45 40. The Contractor is responsible to submit a list of all systems requiring testing no later than 60 days from the notice to proceed. When the list is approved, the Contractor is to submit test plans for all systems on the list. The tests are to be conducted when systems are completely installed for the entire system. There is to be 14 days notice of system testing. This section also limits the percentage of a system that will be considered complete based on the status of the list, test plans, and completion of testing. Q4) The carpet rep is saying they never heard of the carpet tile that is in the specifications. A4) It was confirmed that this is an obsolete product. Substitute Milliken ―Colorweave‖ series or any equal product meeting the specifications and approximate appearance in color and pattern selection. Q5) On drawings A-200 & A-210 reflected ceiling plan there is the symbol O the description is ceiling mounted or recessed can fixture. If we are removing cleaning and re-lamping we will need what type of lamp to bid. If the new fixture bid is accepted we will need to know what to supply. Please note that this fixture type is shown on A-200 & A-210 in vestibule 124 but not on drawing E-100. A5) General note 3 on A-200 indicates to remove existing lights in ceiling grid areas. Drywall ceiling areas will not have light fixtures removed. This leaves only 8 of this fixture type in rooms 152 & 153. These 8 fixtures will be removed and reinstalled without re-lamping. The additive bid item will not include these fixtures. Q6) Need clarification for tapered roof, specs. Call for min. ¼‖ per foot and min R20 insulation. This would put the height of insulation at section 2/A-501 at 14 ½‖. Are we to build up gravel stop? Also on g-001, alternate bid items, ABI #6, upgrade to white membrane, is this rubber or TPO? W912KC-09-B-0002 0002 Page 4 of 37 A6) A. This roof has sloped steel. The roof steel from column line 1 slopes approximately 3 1/8‖ to column line 2A. On the main roof, the roof steel from column row J slopes 12‖ over approximately 41’-6‖ to the east to a load bearing wall and from column row F slopes 12‖ over approximately 50’ to the west to the same load bearing wall. On the eastern section of the roof the steel slopes from column row E 7‖ over approximately 20’ to column row C and 7‖ from column row A over approximately 36’ to column row C. The sloped steel will require significantly less tapered insulation than anticipated in the question. This information should be sufficient for bidding purposes. The actual structural drawings will be reproduced and provided to the successful contractor for detailed planning. B. Material shall be EPDM. Q7) Reference Specification Section 015100, Construction Facilities, Section 2.01 B.1: Specifications state that the contractor is responsible for ―providing wiring for telephones and computer networks‖. Approximately how many telephone and computer wall jacks will the contractor be required to install? A7) The goal is to have two telephone and two computer data wall jacks available in each room, regardless of room size. Since the layout of the trailers is not yet determined, plan to allow for a total of 35 telephones and 35 computer data wall jacks total. Q8) Reference Specification Section 075323, EPDM Roofing. Please identify the manufacturer and installer of the existing roofing scheduled to remain. Is the existing roofing to remain covered under any warranty and, if so, what are the contractor’s responsibilities for maintaining that warranty? A8) The existing to remain roof is a Johns Manville system installed by Varga Roofing Inc, 1300 Renton Road, Pittsburgh, PA 15239. The system was installed 11/30/03 and has a 20 year UltraGard Roofing Systems Guarantee number ANE121026119. The new roofing shall be installed so that the existing to remain roofing guarantee is not impacted. The Johns Manville Guarantee Services Regional phone number for the eastern region is 800-345-9603. CONTRACTING QUESTIONS Q1) On the bid form, can you clarify what 2 amounts include, sustainment repair portion and R&M repair portion? A1) Both portions comprise the ―Base Bid‖ and are for Contracting / Finance purposes only. If using this form for your bid, simply annotate your bid on the sheet with the words ―BASE BID.‖ In the solicitation amendment there will be additional line items (bid forms) for the Alternative Bid Items (ABIs) – see Q8. Q2) When will the solicitation form 1442 be reissued without a draft mark? A2) Whenever the DRAFT solicitation is approved by the higher level state contracting authorities. NOTE: If necessary, the Contracting Officer will extend the bid due date to allow for sufficient time to formulate / submit bids. Q3) What will be the required to be submitted with this offer? A3) The bids (base and ABIs); Certified bid bond; Tax Identification #; Online Representations and Certifications Application (ORCA) Representations and Certifications (Reps and Certs). Q4) What is the amount of the bid bond? A4) The bid bond amount will be 20% of the bid price. W912KC-09-B-0002 0002 Page 5 of 37 Q5) Is there a bid bond form? A5) There is no federal bid bond form. I believe it is specific to the state where the bonding agent is located. NOTE: The solicitation amendment will contain Provision 52.228-1 – Bid Guarantee (Sep 1996) -- which will more fully explain the requirements. Q6) Is there a form for alternates? A6) No. A bid bond will be the only acceptable bid guarantee. Q7) For work purposes, are we to assume that the every other Monday that the base closed? A7) Specification section 01 00 00, 1.07, B indicates the work hours. The base is closed every other Monday. A schedule of off-Monday’s and holidays will also be provided at the Pre-Construction conference. Q8) Will the amendment show the Base bid and Alternative Bid Items (ABIs)? A8) Yes. Bid form will be changed with lines for a base bid and each additive bid item.

Ballasts and lamp requirements for the existing fixtures shall match those specified for the new fixtures. Q8) On drawing E-100 in Note #1 it says to remove all speakers and fire detection devices, store them and reinstall. What drawing will we find the speakers on? None of the electrical or fire alarm drawings show existing speakers. A8) Drawing A-200. Q9) On drawing E-101 it shows one place that we are to build a frame for installing antennas on but on drawing A- 600 it shows three places to build frames for antennas, please advise. A9) There are three new antenna racks as shown on A-600. Q10) On drawing E-200 in room 109 it shows two UHF Radio Speakers. What size and manufacture do you want? What type wire do you want us to run to it? Where is the head end equipment for the speakers? A10) Speakers are to be 8‖, ceiling mounted, high impedance, 70V, with integral volume control.

Q11) On drawing FA-101 is the ―H‖ in a dashed circle a heat detector? On drawing FA-001 under the Fire Alarm Legend an ―H‖ in a dashed square is a heat detector. A11) The ―H‖ in a dashed circle on drawing FA-101 is a heat detector. Q12) Reference Drawings A-100, A-101, A-300 and A-600: Drawings A-100 and A-101 indicate that the double doors into Mechanical Room 119 are to be removed and replaced as per the door schedule on Drawing A-300. The door schedule indicates that this opening is to receive a new hollow metal frame and insulated hollow metal doors. However, the South Elevation Detail 7 on Drawing A-600 appears to show a new aluminum framed door with glazing. This detail is referenced on Drawing A-101 at the doors to Equipment Storage Room 134. The Drawings do not indicate that this door is to be replaced. See sub-questions a through f. RESPONSE after each question. b) Please confirm that no work is to be performed on the exterior door to Room 134. RESPONSE: There is no work on the exterior door to Room 134. The detail reference 7/A600 on drawing A-101 should be facing west to the door at the end of corridor 125. This door is to have the masonry around the door repaired as indicated in the detail 7/A-600 on A-600. Detail 7/A-600 on A-600 is actually the EAST elevation and incorrectly references detail 6/A-600. W912KC-09-B-0002 0002 Page 7 of 37 c) Please confirm that the doors shown on Detail 7/A-600 are the doors into Room 119. RESPONSE: Detail 7/A-600 is not for the door into room 119.

RESPONSE: Correct. e) Please confirm that the only aluminum framed entrance to be removed and replaced is the exterior door to Room 144. RESPONSE: Correct. f) Please confirm that the only door openings to receive new lintels are the exterior door opening to Room 144 and the exterior door opening to Room 119. RESPONSE: The door to 119 does not receive a new lintel. Only the door to 144 receives a new lintel as scheduled in the lintel schedule in the structural drawings. Q13) The window manufacturer has indicated that the window width of 40" exceeds the maximum of 36" Due to the excessive weight of the glass, even a 36" width is too much weight for the hardware. The factory is recommending using a project out window with fixed above (1/3 - 2/3 configuration).The manufacturer also expressed that they cannot use SOLAR BAN 60 LOW E with the specified glass make up. They can only use a Hardcoat LOW E. A13) Change specification Section 08 52 00 paragraph 1.03C to the following: C. Glazing and Glazing Systems Subjected to Airblast Loadings: The test specimen shall be tested in accordance with ASTM F 1642.

The weeklong, nationwide recognition effort is a program spearheaded by the National Association of Community Centers (NACHC) of Bethesda, Md.
Plus, a six-month report recently released by clinic officials show the clinic is expected to exceed last year’s totals, and that primary care has been provided to 911 patients. Also, nearly 9,500 prescriptions have been provided to county residents who qualify for their services.
NACHC leaders said, .”
Justin Coby, executive director of HPFC, said the goals of the initiative are to enhance the visibility and profile of the clinic; and to generate community pride and build support. Coby said the success of the clinic is directly tied to the dedication of staff, volunteers, and community member supporters, throughout Miami County.
“With the addition of a full-time nurse practitioner, expanded clinic hours, and the transition into the Affordable Care Act, 2014 has been quite the dynamic year for us. As we take a moment to reflect upon and analyze our service numbers, we know that none of this would have been possible without the support of our local donors, supporting foundations and United Way partners,” Coby said.
Recently, the director released a statistical review of HPFC’s first half of the year. The reported data is through July 31.
• The direct medical care is provided through the assistance of volunteer physicians and full-time/part-time nurse practitioners. This care is to treat our chronic care patients (long term illnesses such as high blood pressure and diabetes) and walk-in clinic times, where we offer acute care (short illnesses such as a sore throat). So far, the clinic has cared for 911 unique patients.
• Nursing visits are scheduled weekly visits. These visits allow patient to follow-up on chronic therapy, and/or an opportunity to evaluate the effectiveness of current therapy. To date, we have been able to provide 188 nursing visits to our patients.
• Diagnostic and lab testing initiated by Health Partners has provided 1,932 blood work tests, X-rays and other necessary tests such as carotid or venous studies to our patients at no cost.
• Prescription medications are a critical component of our patients’ health care. Health Partners has been able to provide 9,442 prescription medications so far this year, at a value of over $1.4 million.
• Direct Hospital Referral is a more streamed-line referral system for uninsured and under-insured patients originally seen by the local hospital, Upper Valley Medical Center (as in- or out-patient), and in need of follow-up care within seven days. Through the first six months, the Clinic has provided 82 primary care visits, five social service consults, seven nursing clinic appointments, and 36 phlebotomy visits to these patients referred directly from UVMC. In total, these services are valued at nearly $30,000, and delivered to the patient at no cost.
• Social service consults provide patients a social worker to speak with each Thursday night to direct them to local services they may need. This year to date, we have been able to provide 129 social service consults.
Coby said, “The report’s outcome results are valued at more than $2 million, and at this pace we are set to surpass last year’s figure of nearly $3.3 million in services and medication. This is an $8.36 value of medical services provided to our patients for every $1 we spend.
“It takes everyone to make Health Partners a success, and a vital and much-needed resource for Miami County,” Coby said.
Health Partners Free Clinic is located at 1300 N. County Road 25-A in Troy, and can be found on their website at. The phone number is (937) 332-0894.Do you know where your net is?Thursday, April 24, 2014 by: Bob Mihell
Depending on whether you have a Type A or Type B personality, smelt fishers might want to begin thinking about finding their nets in their garages or basements.
Although there is still 18 to 20 inches of ice at Haviland, Harmony and Batchewana bays north of the Sault, according to a local fishing expert, there are reliable reports that the smelts are running under the ice preparing for their annual spawning trip up area rivers and streams.
Orest Witiw, who runs the sporting section at the Trading Post, said that as a rule of thumb, the smelt run does not begin until the ice leaves the bays, but acknowledged too that the smelt run is triggered by water temperature.
Witiw said the Trading Post usually gets a head up when the annual run is underway because people come in to buy smelt nets.
Smelts begin to move into rivers and streams entering Lake Superior about a week to ten days after the run starts in St. Joseph’s Island and along the North shore, he said.
“There is nothing happening east of the Sault. Lake Huron is still frozen over as well,” Witiw said. “We’re a little bit behind, but we have had years like this in the past.”
Witiw, an avid fisher for over 40 years, recalled catching smelts in the Chippewa River in late May around the long weekend, and the start of the walleye season.
Presently, he said, ice fishers are enjoying an extended season on Haviland, and other bays north of the Sault, where they’re catching limits of whitefish, perch and rainbow trout.
While this winter was harsh, he said those fisher who braved the cold and snow enjoyed a very productive season.
“Winter was brutal; the conditions weren’t very good, but people with portable shacks were getting big perch and lots of whitefish.”
Witiw said how much longer the ice remains in the bays would depend on the weather.
“If we get some warm weather and rain the ice can rot very quickly,” he said.
As of April 22, the Sault O.P.P. detachment had not issued any ice condition warnings for area lakes, but nevertheless they are urging people to use caution before going on lakes because ice conditions can change suddenly.
Meanwhile, a spokesperson for the Ministry of Natural Resources said Wednesday that he had heard an unconfirmed report that the smelt run had begun on Manitoulin Island.
Bruce Tomlinson, MNR conservation officer in the Algoma region, said that water temperature is the best scientific predictor of when the smelt run begins.
“When the water temperature in rivers and streams hits nine or ten degrees celsius the smelt spawning cycle will occur,” he said. “Ice on the lakes does not change that.”
He added that the smelt spawning cycle ends when the water temperature climbs to 15 degrees celsius.
“If we had a major thunderstorm that would influence the start of the smelt run,” he said.
Conversely, under those types of conditions, if the water temperature rose quickly it could shorten the smelt run, he pointed out.
Cathy Phillips, the owner of Harmony Beach Lakeview Resort, has her own way of predicting when the smelt run is about to begin.
“Everything depends on Mother Nature,” she said. “I just go by the buds on the trees, and when I hear the frogs in the creek at night. I haven’t heard them yet.”
She is hoping, however, she’ll hear them soon.
Her restaurant has been serving baskets of fresh smelts to customers for the past 23 years.
“I am getting about a 100 calls a day for the past week from people asking if we have smelts yet, and when are they going to be here,” she quipped.
For many people, it’s a lot easier to come to the restaurant for their annual smelt feed than to catch them and clean them.
“It’s a lot less work,” she said.
Although smelts are a popular spring delicacy for many area residents, Tomlinson noted that smelts, like alewife, another small fish, and salmon, were originally ocean saltwater species that were introduced to the freshwater lakes system.
He said that freshwater smelts originated in 1923 when they were planted in Crystal Lake, Michigan, and spread to Lake Michigan from there.
Despite their popularity as a food, their value is debatable, he said.
“They do interfere with the food chain and can be detrimental to a lake’s bio-diversity,” he said.
That is particularly true of alewife, and to a lesser extent smelts, who prey on lake trout fry after they are hatched in their spawning grounds.
Tomlinson said that one of the reasons salmon were introduced to the lake system was to help rehabilitate a dwindling lake trout population.
“We were losing lake trout because they were being eaten by these invasive species before they had a chance to mature, so we needed something to knock back the alewife population.”
Writer’s Comment: I suspect many among us have fond memories of smelt fishing and smelt dinners. Among my favourites as a boy is associated with eating our annual smelt feed. My dad always got stuck cleaning them, and my mom was cook. My job was to go in the backyard with a small knife to dig up tender young dandelion greens. My mother would mix the greens with some lettuce and an oil and vinegar dressing. Simple fare fit for royalty. I haven’t eaten dandelion greens for decades, but I have noticed them from time to time in the produce section of some grocery stores.

By Vicki Allen
WASHINGTON (Reuters) – The House of Representatives on
Friday took a symbolic jab at Saudi Arabia, accusing the
kingdom of fueling.
The funds are intended to provide classroom space and pay
for experts to help train counter-terrorism police.
Rep. Jim Kolbe, an Arizona Republican, said the measure
would hurt efforts to foster Saudi Arabia as a partner in
fighting terrorism. But his was a lonely voice.
Congress has passed similar measures in the past, but Bush
has used a waiver to clear the funds to Saudi Arabia.
In other action on the bill, lawmakers voted 229-174
against a measure to cut $30 million from $545 million in
counter-narcotics funds for Colombia.
Critics said the cut was needed to show displeasure at
Columbia’s failure to reduce coca production and continued
alleged human rights abuses by its military.
But other lawmakers said Colombia has made big strides in
quelling violence in the country long wracked by a guerrilla
war funded largely by the drug trade.
“This is not the time to send the signal that we do not
believe that Colombia is doing what it needs to be doing,”
Kolbe said.
Among other measures in the bill are $3.4 billion to fight
global AIDS, tuberculosis and malaria; $2 billion for the
Millennium Challenge Corporation that offers aid to countries
that make economic and political reforms; $522 million for
stabilization efforts in Iraq, and $962 million in aid to
Afghanistan.IGN

Ford Mustang Locking Steering Columns - Understanding Locking Steering Columns
In 1970, Ford Began Fitting Mustangs With Locking Steering Columns To Improve Vehicle Security
Nearly a century ago, automobile security began with door and ignition locks. As the bad guys became more creative, automakers, along with Washington and insurance companies, had to become even smarter, with the federal government mandating anti-theft locking steering columns for the '70 model year. General Motors got the jump, installing locking steering columns in '69 along with a key reminder buzzer.
With Ford locking steering columns, the ignition lock cylinder is located at the top of the column, just below the steering wheel, while the actual ignition switch is located below the collar on the column tube, activated by a simple linkage. The steering wheel locking mechanism is located in the collar just below the steering wheel. A long tube within the steering column with a lever at the steering gear is what keeps the transmission selector in Park (automatic transmissions) or Reverse (manual transmissions) when the ignition is turned off and locked. It's harder to steal a car in Park or Reverse.
Although Ford locking steering columns went through minor revisions during the 1970s, their basic function changed little, many in the area of safety. The design of collapsible steering columns changed in the years following 1970 as more was learned about crashes and their effects on occupants. As we examine '70-'78 Ford locking steering columns, we learn that '70 was a stand-alone column for one year only. Model years '71-'72 had the same column, with minor changes at the end of '72 that continued through '73. For '74-'78, there were two types of locking steering columns-one more like '73 for '74-'75 and another in '76-'78 with the windshield wiper switch located in the turn signal lever.
For this article, we're going to focus the function of fixed (non-tilt) '70-'78 Mustang steering columns. In a later issue, we'll show how to rebuild a '70-'78 locking steering column-both fixed and tilt.
As mentioned earlier, '70 is a stand-alone locking steering column. Although '71-'78 columns are virtually the same at the collar, Ford located the ignition switch farther down the column to move it under the dashboard and out of harm's way, making access more difficult for thieves. For '70, the linear-actuated ignition switch is tied directly to the ignition lock actuator just below the collar. The transmission lock operates via a tube within a tube to the moving collar just below the fixed collar. The tube and collar, which are hidden by a plastic sleeve, move to the locked position when automatics are placed in Park or manual transmissions are placed in Reverse. The actuator pin mechanism moves into the rotating collar, locking the transmission in Reverse or Park.
Removing The Ignition Lock Cylinder
Removing the ignition lock cylinder is the same from '70-'78. Like '65-'69 Mustangs, you need the key for ignition lock cylinder removal. Turn the ignition key to "on" and insert a paper clip into the hole as shown. The lock cylinder should come right out. Just grab it by the ears and give it a yank. This gives you access to the locking mechanism. You can turn the lock mechanism with a common screwdriver.Games

Israel Premier David Ben Gurion has given assurances of recognition of the principle that Bar-Ilan University, religiously-oriented institution of higher learning in Israel, had earned the right to a subsidy from the Israel Government, it was reported at a press conference here by Rabbi Joseph Lookstein, chairman of the Academic Council of the university.
Rabbi Lookstein, who returned from a two-month study of the problems created for the university by the sudden death last year of its founder and first president, Dr. Pinchos Churgin, told the press conference that the university, now in its fourth year, had achieved acceptance among sections of the population which had been skeptical or opposed to it at the start. It now has 60 faculty members and 260 students.good saddle horse, very sensitive to pressure would be good dressage prospect$1,000

Characters - Poem by Anna Laetitia Barbauld
OH! born to sooth distress, and lighten care;
Lively as soft, and innocent as fair;
Blest with that sweet simplicity of thought
So rarely found, and never to be taught;
Of winning speech, endearing, artless, kind,
The loveliest pattern of a female mind;
Like some fair spirit from the realms of rest
With all her native heaven within her breast;
So pure, so good, she scarce can guess at sin,
But thinks the world without like that within;
Such melting tenderness, so fond to bless,
Her charity almost becomes excess.
Wealth may be courted, wisdom be rever'd,
And beauty prais'd, and brutal strength be fear'd;
But goodness only can affection move;
And love must owe its origin to love.
OF gentle manners, and of taste refin'd,
With all the graces of a polish'd mind;
Clear sense and truth still shone in all she spoke,
And from her lips no idle sentence broke.
Each nicer elegance of art she knew;
Correctly fair, and regularly true :
Her ready fingers plied with equal skill
The pencil's task, the needle, or the quill.
So pois'd her feelings, so compos'd her soul,
So subject all to reason's calm controul,

- Janet Chismar Senior Editor, News & Culture

It’s one thing to get glowing reviews from the Christian media and believing moviegoers. But perhaps the greatest testimony to the power of a film such as The Gospel of John is how it has impacted non-Christians.
Take producer Garth Drabinsky, who is Jewish. “Everyone who worked on the project found it emotionally very, very uplifting – even if you weren’t reared in Christianity,” Drabinsky told Crosswalk.com during a recent interview. “You can’t avoid the majesty of this work – the nobility of it – it’s reverence and the fact that is has affected the lives of millions of people for centuries and centuries.”
Born in Toronto in 1949, Drabinsky studied the Old Testament as a child. “I read the Torah fluently, which is a reasonably complex thing to do. So I’ve always found it to be very pulling and it tugs at my basic foundation. Philosophically, it’s almost unavoidable to read John and not be overwhelmed with the ideas of Christ, as simple as some of them are, yet so complex in terms of their execution. The concept of loving one another is certainly something that the world has never figured out – certainly in these tumultuous times.”

Haslem speaks, Heat's role players rise up
By Michael Wallace
INDIANAPOLIS --.
The supporting cast boost continued with guard Mario Chalmers, who scored seven of his 14 points during a 9-1 run in the third quarter to extend the Heat's lead to 15 after Indiana rallied to within 78-70 midway through the period.
Miami got much of the same from Chris “Birdman” Andersen, who had nine points, nine rebounds and two blocks. He also extended his perfect shooting streak by making 16 consecutive shots over the past four games.
The Heat's reserves were in such a good rhythm in Game 3 that even Ray Allen and Shane Battier got back to knocking down 3-pointers. Allen had been scoreless in Indiana this season and Battier was shooting 23.1 percent from 3-point range during the playoffs before Sunday.
It was all a collective dose of much-needed relief for Miami's marquee players. James had 22 points, four rebounds and three assists, Wade added 18 points and eight assists and Bosh contributed 15 points and three rebounds.
The balanced effort completely derailed the Pacers' plan coming in to force James, Wade and Bosh do most of the heavy lifting and while shutting down Miami's role players.
James credited Haslem for setting the tone on a night when the Heat showed the form they played with during their 27-game winning streak that ran through February and March.
“He's the heartbeat of our team, first of all,” James said of Haslem before singling out other teammates. “There's no one on our roster that plays that we don't have the utmost confidence in. For him to come through and do what he was able to do offensively from the start -- with [Chalmers] stepping up in the third, also Shane and Ray contributing, [Andersen] giving us his usual. We needed everyone's effort and it allowed us to get a big win on the road.”
Indiana coach Frank Vogel pointed to Haslem's hot start as one of the key reasons the game got away early.
“Is he going to shoot 8-for-9 every night? We'll see,” Vogel said. “If he does, it's probably going to be a long series for us. We have to make some adjustments, for sure.”
But one of the adjustments for the Heat came a few hours before Game 3 started. That's when Haslem stepped to the front and talked about a needed attitude adjustment. The room fell silent as the usually reserved co-captain spoke.
“He doesn't talk too much,” Wade said. “When (Haslem) talks, he's not just talking to hear his voice. We understand that this guy is all heart. This is one of the total team guys. When he steps up and says something, everyone listens.”
Haslem then made sure his game spoke volumes. He regained his touch on the baseline jumpers that had been a staple of the Heat's offense dating way back to their run to the title in 2006 while playing alongside Shaquille O'Neal.
This, in part, was the Heat's response to the Pacers' 97-93 victory in Miami in Game 2. After that game Friday, Indiana star Paul George referred to the Heat having a Big 3 and the Pacers having a more balanced Big 5. The Heat's role players were motivated to deliver a statement game.
“It was very important for us to come in here, take them out of it and play our game,” Chalmers said. “We talked about coming in here and getting everybody involved. We knew what we had to do. When we come in here and everyone shares the ball, we're an impossible team to beat.”
What started as a talk translated into a resounding win that was arguably the Heat's best performance of the playoffs.
“We needed to play like our basketball lives are on the line,” Haslem said. “That's the type of scenario we tried to create for ourselves. LeBron has been having a great series, has been carrying us. But it takes all of us to get this done.”The Da Vinci Notebooks at sacred-texts.com

"This is the point where we hit the wall," she says. "This is our maddest time." The analogy is a good one but also a risky one, because for some runners "the wall" spells disaster.
With just 100 days to go before the festival opens on 21 June Mackenzie fizzes with confidence and enthusiasm for the cultural events commissioned to mark the Olympics. "Our fundamental criteria has been that they will only happen once in a lifetime," she says.
Mackenzie is speaking before the festival's brochure deadline, the point of no return. ," Mackenzie says.
The "brochure" will not be made public until the end of April when a document bigger than the Edinburgh Fringe guide will be published and we will see for ourselves just how unforgettable – or forgettable – the festival will be.
In terms of what we know, many would say that the signs are good: a Pina Bausch retrospective at Sadlers' Wells and the Barbican; films by Mike Leigh and Lynne Ramsay; Cate Blanchett on stage in Botho Strauss's Big and Small; Martin Creed trying to get the entire nation to ring a bell quickly and loudly for three minutes; spectacular pyrotechnics on Windermere; Radio 1's Hackney Weekend with Leona Lewis, Plan B and more; Simon Rattle conducting Wynton Marsalis' swing symphony; one-off screenings of newly restored Hitchcock films across London; and exhibitions of work by Damien Hirst at Tate Modern and Tracey Emin at Margate.
Barely a day goes by without Mackenzie attending a launch for what is invariably "a major announcement." On Tuesday, the Birmingham Opera Company will reveal details of its plan to stage the world premiere of Karlheinz Stockhausen's six-hour opera Mittwoch, which includes a section in which a string quartet performs in four separate helicopters. The transformation of the Olympiad's reputation has been remarkable. Mackenzie was appointed just two years ago, a short period in terms of arts commissioning. "You have to take the positive," she says. "There's not much point in moaning that it would have been nicer to have been there three years earlier. It means I had to move fast and be decisive and that is quite exhilarating. There's not much room for hesitation. It's been fun. On a good day it is really good fun."
The brief history of the Cultural Olympiad is this. It was launched in the autumn of 2008 to a largely negative response – it seemed so earnest, so mired in committee-led worthiness. Most arts bosses would say "yes we will be taking part … once we know who's in charge and what it is we're taking part in." It lacked a big idea until, very late in the day, with Mackenzie's appointment.
White the "Cultural Olympiad" brand was becoming a bit of a joke, Mackenzie thinks some of the criticisms were unfair. They were responsible for a lot of successes, she says. "Our latest figures show that 16m people have experienced the Cultural Olympiad over four years – that's great."
She adds: "A lot of it was not easy or simple for journalists to talk about. But with the greatest respect that doesn't mean it's not good."
Mackenzie says some of the Cultural Olympiad achievements had been "phenomenal". Things such as the Tate Movie project which involved 34,000 children making a film with Aardman; the Lakes Alive festival in Cumbria which some assume must have been going on for decades; and the enormously successful Big Dance.
The World Shakespeare Festival was also up and running before Mackenzie got involved. Produced by the Royal Shakespeare Festival, thousands of artists from around the world will take part in nearly 70 productions. There will also be a connected season produced by Shakespeare's Globe that will have every play performed in a different language – Antony and Cleopatra in Turkish, for example, Cymbeline in Juba Arabic, and Henry VI, Part 2 in Albanian.
Another important part of the Cultural Olympiad is the £3m Unlimited strand, billed as the biggest ever UK celebration of disabled arts. But people still simply did not "get" the Cultural Olympiad. Mackenzie realised that an easy to grasp arts celebration was also needed, hence the London 2012 Festival.
There are now so many projects, so many people involved, that it is hard to get a precise handle on the figures. Roughly speaking, however, the overall budget is more than £97m. That breaks down to £52m for commissions for the London 2012 Festival and £45m for projects in the broader Cultural Olympiad. It is clearly a large sum although not that much more than the £80m allocated to the opening and closing ceremonies of the Games.
Countdown event
The fact Glasgow is doing anything at all for the London Olympics – an event that, as Bremner put it, is "145 days and 400 miles away", – is something of a coup. But here is the SNP culture minister, Fiona Hyslop, in animated conversation with Mackenzie.
While in Glasgow, Mackenzie works the room faultlessly, like a politician. That should come as no surprise. She did work as a special adviser in the department of culture under five different secretaries of state, a feat of endurance by any measure. She knows how things work and she understands the politics of politics. She also needs such skills to deal with the fair amount of snide comment still directed at the Cultural Olympiad. The former Culture Show presenter Lauren Laverne read a skit about it on a recent edition of Channel 4's 10 O'Clock show, mocking a project in Coventry where a 10m-high Lady Godiva puppet is being built which will travel to London powered by 100 cyclists. An easy target perhaps.
"My view is that mocking modern art is 20 years out of date," said Mackenzie. "When I started in the arts I remember people mocked the Tate for having bricks outside it and a man walking round East Anglia with a pole on his head. Now Tate Modern is one of the most popular destinations in London."
Most of the arts community appears to be on board. At the recent State of the Arts conference in Salford, a gathering of arts managers from across England, the playwright David Edgar questioned the funds being spent on the opening ceremony but not, to be fair, on the London 2012 Festival.
"Afterwards I thought of a really good response but I was at Crewe," she says. "Just as we in the arts world say it is a false proposition when you say 'Why don't you stop funding the arts and spend the money on hospitals?' it is exactly the same to think you have to have a choice between having the opening ceremony of the Olympic Games and the Arts Council's cuts to regularly funded clients.
"No one attacked me at that conference, no one has attacked me in the arts world."
She has, she says, been cut quite a lot of slack. "Once people thought it was going to be a good thing then everyone wanted to help. Success has many parents." Of course there is cynicism, there always is, but you have to seek it out, she adds.
Boat building
Around 450 miles away from Glasgow, in an ordinary looking boat shed in an isolated marina near the West Sussex military base of Thorney Island, is The Boat Project. Artist Gary Winters ponders whether he has had any negative reaction. After a few seconds he says: "We haven't had any. I can't really remember any time when people have shook their heads or thrown their hands up and said, 'What are you doing,' or 'You're wasting money.'"
The project has a simple premise – they asked for pieces of wood that mean something to people with which they would then build a boat. It has, he says, resonated with people. The soon-to-be-finished result is an impressively sleek work of art, a kind of wooden collage.
Master boat builder Mark Covell has led a team converting and flattening everything from a guitar to a cricket bat to mundane planks. "You're having to think in completely different ways all of the time," he says. "The thing for me is that we haven't built a contorted boat – if were to paint it white it would look absolutely like a modern boat.
"It has been a project full of things I've never ever had to do before. It's like putting a man on the moon – we are in completely uncharted territory."
They finished collecting 1,220 donations in July and laid everything – including wood from HMS Victory, from Sir Alec Rose's boat Lively Lady, from the Olympic velodrome, a tiny two-inch square piece of wood from the Mary Rose, a light box from the Ark Royal – in the car park before embarking on the jigsaw of all jigsaws.
Every donation is chronicled, everything, whether it is "wood that looks like a fish" or "driftwood found by husband sitting on doorstep" or, movingly, a mother donating the A-level woodwork project from her late son. "There are some poignant stories," said Covell. "We're not sawing through these pieces with a wave of a hand, we're doing it with real respect.
"We almost don't see it as pieces of wood any more, we see it for what it is – a collection of stories."
The project is one of 12 visual arts projects across the UK called Artists Taking the Lead. Others include Anthony McCall creating a corkscrew of mist on Merseyside that will be visible 60 miles away; a full-sized football pitch created and hidden in a Scottish forest; LED art screens on bus shelter roofs in London and art work created from the wreckage of a DC-9 aeroplane that will tour Wales.
Winters (along with Gregg Whelan) is artistic director of the performance company Lone Twin. They put their application in for the south-east commission in 2009 with a synopsis that basically said "people contribute wood, a boat is made, boat sails". They were shortlisted and they found Covell to discover if it was actually possible, put in the fuller submission to Arts Council England and discovered they had won. "Then we had to do it," Winters said, laughing. "It was amazing. As a company, we've been fully immersed in the project for the past two years. It is a £500,000 commission which is a decent sized chunk of money that has afforded us a certain scale of operation. It's fantastic, it's going to come off."
The boat will be launched on 7 May, sailing to Portsmouth, Brighton, Hastings, Margate, before being put on a trailer for Milton Keynes. It will also be in Weymouth for the Olympic sailing events.
"A lot of these objects would have ended up in a skip, the objects, stories and memories all lost."
Winters said Lone Twin is happy and proud to be part of the Cultural Olympiad. "We use the phrase 'Cultural Olympiad' all the time and tell people we're part of it but it seems still a slightly alien term to people – I'm sure that will change. I don't think we'll be able to know how good it was, whether it worked until it's over."
If there are naysayers then Waters says simply: "Come and see the work. The country needs culture doesn't it. It is great to be part of a national event, we're proud."Written on: 03/12/2011 by Obag (8 reviews written)
This is a product and company review for the Garmin Forerunner 110 and Garmin as a whole. I have been very pleased with the Garmin Forerunner 110. It's not all been 100% and I'm on my second one, but I''ll get to later. Overall this is a great entry level running watch and has met all my needs.
I had used previous pedometer type running aids prior to getting the Forerunner and I was immediately struck by how much more accurate it was than the aids I had been using. It is very easy to use, ie. you can put it on and just head out the door. One issue could be that the buttons on the sides of the watch might seem a little small, but it's not a huge watch so you can't have everything.
Now to Garmin themselves, I did experience an issue with the face of the watch clouding over if I was out for a particularly long, hot run. So it is not quite as waterproof as it might seem. This then caused the watch to develop a fault with the sound. Luckily the watch was still within warranty and after contacting Garmin and returning it, they sent out a brand new replacement just 3 days later. No fuss no bother.
All in all very pleased with the product and service I have received.

Led by a strong desire to make a studio quality band accessible to any size church in an affordable way, founder Lee Bridges has developed an app specifically for church and worship leaders. ‘Worship Band in Hand’ hit the Apple App Store April 10th and will include favorite songs like "Our God," "Hosanna," "Mighty to Save," "Revelation Song" and many, many more.
“Our goal with Worship Band in Hand is to transport a studio-quality worship band into churches everywhere. We want to offer a flexible backing band that can shrink or grow to fill in the gaps of a church’s shrinking or growing worship team,” said Bridges. “Worship Band in Hand works along side live musicians to create a full worship experience that can be tailored to fit a church’s specific and unique needs.”
According to the 2009 National Congregations Study by Duke, there are 177,000 protestant churches in America with less than 100 people in their congregation every Sunday. Congregations of this size often have a difficult time filling a full worship band.
Rather than requiring a special computer setup and charging a premium for songs, Worship Band in Hand works with devices that many churches already have access to- the iPhone, iPad and iPod Touch. It provides Church and Worship Leaders with a backing band that can be tailored to fit their needs. With Worship Band in Hand worship leaders have the ability to doing the following: fill their worship band with only the instruments they need, mix their working backing band just the way they like it, create and edit sets lists and change the key of the songs to fit their voice. It also gives worship leaders the freedom to not have to scramble to fill a position in the band when the drummer cancels last minute and the ability to make room for a pianist by just muting the keyboards in Worship Band in Hand.
One of the most unique traits of Worship Band in Hand is that the app itself is free. Songs are available in the in-app store for only $4.99-9.99.
Being mindful of each churches budget was especially important to founder Lee Bridges. “We understand that many churches that will find Worship Band in Hand useful do not have large budgets, and we do not wish to put financial strain on any church.”
Worship Band in Hand launched April 10th and are available for purchase in the Apple App Store. For more information about Band in Hand visit
About Worship Band in Hand
Worship Band in Hand is a mobile app for iOS (iPhone, iPad, and iPod Touch). It provides Church and Worship Leaders with a backing band that can be tailored to their needs. Tools include the ability to create and edit set lists, change the key of the songs to fit the singers voice, fill in the worship band with multiple instruments or simply the instruments needed.“It’s a sad day for Minnesota”
The budget forecast delivered by state finance officials on Wednesday is perhaps the bleakest outlook in Minnesota’s history.
“This is the worst, without a question,” said Jay Kiedrowski, a senior fellow at the University of Minnesota’s Humphrey Institute of Public Affairs.
As the state’s chief financial officer under Gov. Rudy Perpich in the 1980s, Kiedrowski dealt hands-on with the fallout from another major recession.
What’s compounding the current shortfall is that it comes on the heels of already deep budget cuts and under a governor who refuses to raise revenues, he said.
The trends, if left unchecked, will have widespread consequences, from larger K-12 class sizes and higher college tuition rates to bumpier roads and fewer police officers.
“It’s a sad day for Minnnesota,” said Kiedrowski. Continue reading »

NBIA’s Eighth Summit for Advanced Incubation Professionals, a members-only event for experienced incubation leaders, took place Feb. 9-11 in Orlando, Fla. About 40 NBIA members from 25 states, Canada and France attended. The retreat-style compact event was packed full of discussions, debate and idea exchanges about innovation, entrepreneurship, business incubation and the entrepreneur support ecosystem at large.
Following a Sunday evening reception that gave attendees the opportunity to meet the people they’d be working with over the next two days, the event opened Monday morning with a welcome and introductions.
The first session, Great Start-ups, Great Entrepreneurs: Working with the People that Make an Entrepreneur a Success, was moderated by David Terry, executive director of the West Texas A&M University Enterprise Network in Amarillo, Texas. The session was divided into three topics, and Jerry Ross, executive director of the National Enterprise Center in Orlando, Fla. began with a discussion on the entrepreneurial spirit. Ross, a self-proclaimed lifelong entrepreneur, said, “If you have met one entrepreneur… you’ve meet one entrepreneur because they are all different. As coaches we need to recognize that.”
Ross joked that he would have coached Google to change its name, and points out that it’s an incubator manager’s responsibility to recognize the visions client entrepreneurs have. “What drives success in the beginning drives others crazy in the end,” said Ross. “How they got to be successful is stubborn persistence, and we need to help them grow. We need to help them make the transition, moving from what they do to how they think. It’s the difference between needing a coach and needing a psychiatrist.”

If the ejbSvr crashes first, the connection to the db is lost, then the db rolls back the active transactions and the server becomes not reachable, the client should get a RemoteException.
If is the dbSvr to crash first, all the changes are lost and all uncommitted modification too (but this depends from the databases behaviour). Then the AppSvr gets a SQLException and wraps it in a RemoteException to the client.I assume that uncommitted data are stored in some temporary structure in the db. A bad database could for example corrupt touched data...
In both cases, uncommitted modifications must rationally roll back, even if dbSvr and ejbSvr crash together.
The existence of more or less log files depends on the Application Server that you are using. On WebLogic there's a log to check the jdbc activity too.

Unity Ministry is an Christian faith-based outreach program started by Tabernacle Baptist Church to reach people in need in our area. Unity provides meals, clothing, and the Word of God to our neighbors in New Bern. Started in September of 2010, Unity feeds the homeless and those in need twice a week at Tabernacle Baptist Church. Food is provided Mondays and Thursdays at 5PM at no cost. A clothing closet is also available and donated clothing, books, and small appliances in good repair are provided free of charge. The Word of God is delivered to those willing to listen at each meal.
Suppose a brother or sister is without clothes and daily food. If one of you says to them, "Go in peace; keep warm and well feed," but does nothing about their physical needs, what good is it? James 2:15-16Three dimensions has always been my forte.
With
sculpture, I am free of
the constraints of format that restrict many other forms of
expression. The shape is entirely at my whim. Each surface
of my work must be
interesting and lead a viewer to explore another. I create sculpture in both
stone and welded steel.
Each brings its own challenges and rewards. Stone is a
subtractive process,
welded steel is additive.
Stone has certain intrinsic characteristics;
strength,
color, and over all shape. I like to push the limits of these
characteristics.
I want to twist the stone through itself, to make something hard look
soft, to
have it invite the viewer's hand. As I work a piece, I delight in
bringing
forth the native subtleties of color and texture in the stone. I
enjoy
seeing these attributes as they enhance what I'm sculpting.
Steel has fewer contraints than
stone. It
is
worked semi-molten and
hollow. Steel allows me to be completely unfettered and
free. There is such a feeling of power to have something as hot
as that torch in my
hand and harnessed to my will. Working hollow allows me to
work
larger than
I do with stone.Urschel a candidate for National Football Foundation Scholar-Athlete Award
Urschel a candidate for National Football Foundation Scholar-Athlete Award
UNIVERSITY PARK, Pa. -- Penn State senior John Urschel (Williamsville, N.Y.) is among the candidates for the National Football Foundation Scholar-Athlete Awards presented by Fidelity Investments. He also is a semifinalist for the prestigious William V. Campbell Trophy, endowed by HealthSouth, which recognizes an individual as the top football scholar-athlete in the nation.
Urschel and has an opportunity to become Penn State's 17th NFF Scholar-Athlete recipient, the last being All-America offensive lineman Stefen Wisniewski in 2010. Tony Pittman, Jeff Hartings, Wally Richardson, Aaron Collins and Paul Posluszny are the Nittany Lions' other NFF honorees during the Big Ten era. Director of Athletics Dave Joyner was Penn State's first NFF Scholar-Athlete in 1971.
A 6-3, 301-pound guard, Urschel has started 16 consecutive games for Coach Bill O'Brien's squad and played in 29 straight games. Urschel is also one of 30 candidates for the Senior CLASS Award.
Considered among the nation's premier college football scholar-athletes, Urschel owns a 4.0 grade-point average and is among seven of the 170 Scholar-Athlete nominees from all NCAA and NAIA divisions with a 4.0 GPA. He earned his bachelor's and master's degrees in mathematics over the past four years. The former Canisius High School standout anchors the Nittany Lions' offensive line, and is working on a second master's degree, in math education.
A 2012 first team career.
"We take great pride in the record participation by the number of schools in the NFF National Scholar-Athlete Awards program this year," said NFF Chairman Archie Manning. "It is important for us to showcase that success on the football field starts with winners in the classroom and the community. This year's record-breaking number of nominations further illustrates the power of our great sport in developing the next generation of influential leaders."
The 170 candidates for the Scholar-Athlete awards were nominated by their schools as the best all-around student-athlete on their respective teams. Candidates must be a senior or graduate student in their final year of eligibility, have a grade point average of at least 3.2 on a 4.0 scale, have outstanding football ability as a first team player and have demonstrated strong leadership and citizenship. The candidates come from all levels of play in the NCAA and the NAIA. The trophy is named in honor of Bill Campbell, former player and head coach at Columbia University and the 2004 recipient of the NFF's Gold Medal.
The class is selected each year by the NFF Awards Committee, which is comprised of a nationally recognized group of media, College Football Hall of Fame inductees, and athletics administrators. The committee will select up to 16, endowed by HealthSouth. Symbolizing the essence of the NFF's mission to build leaders through football, the Campbell Trophy comes with an additional $7,000 in scholarship money for a total of $25,000.
Each recipient travels to New York City as the guest of the foundation for the 56th Annual NFF Awards Dinner on December 10.
The Nittany Lions are coming off of a bye week and will open Big Ten play at Indiana on Saturday at 12 p.m. on the Big Ten Network. Penn State delivered a 34-0 win over Kent State on Sept. 21 in its last game, allowing only nine first downs and 190 yards, for its first shutout since 2010. The Nittany Lions ran for 287 yards, their highest total since gaining 338 yards at Illinois in 2009, led by redshirt freshman Akeel Lynch with a season-high 123 yards on just 14 carries and three touchdown runs by junior Zach Zwinak.

His health is rough; he has been the most disastrous vice-president in history; he has lost two wars; he has lost every ally; he is despised in much of the country; he is now going to be the center of all the questions that the Libby guilty verdict raise. Why did he get so exercized about a two-bit critic during a critical time in the Iraq war? Why would he risk losing his most trusted aide by coordinating a media sting on a minor political opponent? Why would he risk committing a crime to pursue Wilson unless he had something very serious to hide? He will now have to answer many questions - either before the press or before the Senate. Mark Daniels asks the right questions:

I wish Cheney were our President. The man is a rock, unlike...
I think Dick Cheney is a hail of a Vice President.
It sounds like Andrew Sullivan might be slipping into AIDS-related dementia.
Did I miss something? What "wars" did he "lose"? We lost 3,000+ men in Iraq. While every life is precious, in 4 years that is one-half the number of men we lost on Iwo Jima in 4 weeks! And who cares about Iwo Jima today? Andrew Sullivan just sounds ignorant and ill-informed with this screed.
My father helped take Okinawa. Anyone know how many we lost on that island?
Oh Andrew you silly boy, or is it girl?
It seems every week there is the question, Should (fill in the blank) resign?
Next, they will be asking if the the guy that cleans up after Barney and Beasley should resign.
He seems to be doing pretty well for a guy who has supposedly had HIV for so many years. Do you think he just made it up to become more popular with the "bug chasers" at his circuit parties?
I think Nancy Pelosi should resign because she's incompetent, can't clean up the corruption within her own nest of vipers, has hoof and mouth disease and the list goes on. It's about time the leadership of the GOP started fighting back against this hourly, daily, weekly, monthly, yearly attack on the Administration.
(And we are supposed to rely on the judgment of such an individual?)
Any time I read drivel like this, I remember back towards the end of Regan's second term. He was constantly lambasted as being a complete idiot by almost every segment of the media. This is the same bile.
What was his proof?
I know Andy likes boys and all but that seems like a personal thing to say.
12,513 dead or missing in 11 weeks of combat.
And idiots like Mike Barnicle has the gall to call the Iraq War the "worst military disaster in American history". Despicable.
If your Dad is still around, please thank him for me.
Sure, then W could appoint Fred Thompson as Veep, Two months before the Election, W could resign Leaving Fred to run as an incumbant for the last two months. (Hey, it makes as much sense as their drivel, Grin)
I wonder how many posts I'll get by angry people?
I have a long list of people who should resign before Cheney, including Sens. "Splash" Kennedy, Leaky Leahy, Dirty Harry, Chuckie Schumer, the unbearably smug Dodd, the unbearably pretentious, butt ugly Carl Levin, the shameless Kerry, that ass Feingold, the insufferable Boxer and of course, the honest and charming Mrs. Clinton (I do not include Obamayomama on my list because he hasn't done anything). Also Waxman, Barney Frank, the wormlike Berman, the dainty Maxine Waters, former ballet dancer Emanuel, the professional veteran Murtha, the virtuous William Jefferson and the modest and unassuming Sheila Jackson Lee --- all of whom have done incredible damange to our country and all of whom can fairly be described as traitors. I could go on but you get the idea. Only after they go should anyone look at Cheney sideways.
No, no. She is making her party look worse and worse every day. Let her stay and dig the grave.
They sure did. Poor President Reagan was constantly called senile for forgetting things or so they said. During those contra trials I wanted to kill the media. They made it seem like he was a dingbat. How dare they?
"He has lost two wars..."
Or so you hope you pig. Your Dem buddies In congress better
get busy before they lose their opportunities to lose these
wars.
Mega green projectile puke on you Mr. Andrew Sullivan, and
I'm one Irishman who hopes you never have a good St. Paddy's
Day again....JJ61
Andrew Sullivan is a raving lunatic. You cannot take this guy's rantings seriously.
TMI!! TMI!!!
[covers eyes and starts singing LA LA LA LA LA LA...]
=:-O
I always thought SNL had the best skits about Reagan--around the press he'd be a dimwitted idiot, but behind the scenes he'd be the sharpest tack in the box. :-)
Sounds a bit like our current CIC, eh?
Andy, you ignorant slut.
The Dims and MSM have them completely on defense. Apologizing, admitting mistakes, throwing Rumsfeld overboard, etc. Meanwhile, they are having some successes in the WOT and North Korea, and the news cycle gets completely taken over by silly, petty federal attorney firings. They are so far back on their heels, the Dims are scoring layup after layup. Pathetic, really.
Meanwhile, the President is down in Mexico groveling over illegals. Like his father he is fighting desperately for a legacy, even one defined by the Democrats. Sooner or later, it seems, all presidents figure out that the history books are written by socialists.
The fact that an article like this can have one ounce of credibility is less repulsive than the fact that the administration will take it seriously and start apologizing, admitting mistakes and throwing people overboard.
I wish he were. He passed away in 2002.
Lies are worthless unless they are strung together to create a story exactly opposite the truth. There cannot be a scintella of truth in the deception of these Marxists or their fantasy will tumble around them. They must provide a complete fabrication, finished in every detail, an alternate reality.
They stand against the truth in pure Machiavellian rhetoric, ready to provide an evil concoction, a witches brew of connivance sufficient to give the weak of mind and the hateful a conspiracy with which to fight the truth.
he has lost two wars;
That's interesting.
NO, GWB is no Ronald Reagan!! Not even close.
I would say what I think about Sullivan but then I'd have to go in rehab.
I was referring to his behavior with the press, and the way
he is viewed by those on the inside--not his political boo-boos. :-)
Andrew's pant load...
There were single days in the Civil War when more men were killed than the Americans who have died in Afghanistan and Iraq combined.
No Andrew...he should go hunting!
Louis Gottschalk, a prominent American psychologist and neuroscientist who earned world renown after studying the mental degeneration of the former president Ronald Reagan, has lost millions of dollars to a Nigerian internet scam, according to court papers filed in California by his son.
My hope is that Bush will resign and give us a real president that can and will stand up to these rats, one who can offer a cogent defense to conservative positions and pound the daylights out of the media. The greatest example of this is the day RR with a fervent anger told the New Hampshire media that attempted to shut off the microphones at the republicans candidates debate (which had been paid by the Reagan campaign) because George Bush refused to participate, "Mr Green, I paid for that microphone". I still remember standing in my living room and cheering. He won that primary hands down even thought Bush was widely favored. We need more of that type of spirited defense of our principled positions. Sadly, we have not had such since RR. Cheney, and maybe Fred Thompson in 2008 might be able to provide it.
They are terrified Cheney will change his mind and run.
I can't believe that in 2000 I used to enjoy reading AS on Drudge! He's been a whining simperer for a long time.
I do hope you are refering to Monty Python's "The Lumberjack Song" LOL!
I do hope you are refering to Monty Python's "The Lumberjack Song" LOL!

Maybe first it’s your nose, catching the scent of burning leaves that makes you swivel your head in a fruitless effort to find the source. It might be your eyes, opening up a little wider to match the detonation of color in the trees or perchance catching a glimpse coming around a corner of … a pirate ship? On a neighborhood lawn? Manned by … zombies? Nothing says “fall has arrived, Halloween is coming” quite like the annual adornment of the streets of Fairborn, decked in spooky splendor from Main to Maple by Mike Foy of Foy’s Variety Stores.
Mike Foy is a third-generation Fairborn storeowner who just can’t seem to get enough of Halloween and all its gory glory.
“Halloween is coming so I’m getting excited, myself,” he said.
Somewhere between setting up a full-scale pirate display and decorating his six storefronts with heavy-duty shows of frightening freaks, he finds the time to festoon his grandparents’ former home, support the Halloween Festival committee, run his Haunted Museum and host a 5K Fright Run. The man doesn’t stop.
“My dad taught me a long time ago, if you’re in business, support the community,” said Foy.
He’s certainly doing his part. In fact, Foy’s whole family is doing its, and has been for nearly 85 years. His grandfather, Albert, opened Foy’s as a five and ten in 1929 at the location that is now their Rock n’ Roll Grill. Mike’s father, Norman, took over in 1940. It was in the ’70s, as Mike was becoming more involved, that the store made the shift to a focus on Halloween.
“The change was because I was more interested in the theatrical part of things,” said Foy.
And so he began acquiring masks and costumes and props, attending shows and conventions to obtain the latest and the greatest, evolving his inventory to match the growing demand for supplies.
“I go to three Halloween conventions a year,” Foy said. “I get excited to see these products. They’re developing products right now for two years out.”
During his tenure, Foy has seen an evolution in the products available.
“There are so many things that have changed and gotten better through the years,” he said. “There are more expensive things to decorate with. People want their yard to look better than anybody else’s. They want their garage to be a haunted house. It’s amazing to me.”
Foy has been witness to the progression of Halloween traditions, too.
“Halloween has changed,” he said. “At one time, older people didn’t know what to think about Halloween. Now I think the kids who grew up with this new Halloween have turned into older people that know what Halloween’s about. It’s a fun holiday. It’s not a bunch of pagans. It’s fun. And it’s changed in the whole United States. It used to be, when my dad was little, you soaped windows and turned over outhouses. Things have really changed. Halloween is getting bigger in Fairborn. We’re known for Halloween just in Fairborn. We have a Halloween parade. It’s the 54th anniversary of our Halloween parade in Fairborn. Thousands of kids are in it. We have a Halloween festival in downtown Fairborn that the Chamber of Commerce puts on. And Halloween is growing in Fairborn still.”
And not just for the owner of the Halloween store. Other Fairborn businesses benefit from the draw that Foy’s has.
“We see a lot of business, especially on nights and weekends,” said Cheryl Abbitt of Tickets Pub and Eatery on Main Street in regards to the inundation downtown Fairborn sees in October. “It’s grown. People go all out.”
“Foy’s really has a national draw,” said Tonya Campbell of the Fairborn Area Chamber of Commerce on the Foy’s phenomenon. “People call from out of state for information about the Foy’s stores, as far away as Texas. It’s a destination. Some people come for tradition. They went to Foy’s as kids, and they want to bring their kids. It’s just huge. There’s not a place to park on Fridays and Saturdays in October!”
This is not a passing fancy. After decades of building the family business and generations of passing down tradition, Foy is here to stay.
“Main Street in Fairborn has been Main Street my whole life,” he said. “I love downtown, and I’ll stay downtown. … I like things to stay the same.”
But Foy understands that surviving in the world of commerce means adapting.
“I don’t like much change, but I’ll take a little bit,” he said. “When we started this business, there were four costume stores in Dayton. There was one in Huber Heights, Beavercreek, they were everywhere. Well, slowly the small ones that didn’t change and didn’t grow, went out of business. … I don’t want to let that happen to me. So you have to change some. You have to improve.”
One such improvement is Foy’s selection of masks, which has grown to be the largest in Ohio. There are more than a thousand on display in the Variety Store, many seemingly giving you the stink eye as you wander past.
“I’m kind of proud of our mask selection,” Foy said, smiling from between a deranged clown and Richard Nixon. “Mardi Gras masks are just getting more, bigger and bigger. We sell thousands of Mardi Gras masks. It’s amazing how things have changed. Mardi Gras is coming up from the South, and people, every day, somebody’s in buying masks. A lot of people have said to me, ‘How can a costume store make it year-round?’ It does.”
This is part of what separates Foy’s from the Halloween box stores that pop up this time of year. Foy’s wouldn’t make it if they didn’t have the selection, knowledge and customer service that far surpasses their corporate counterparts.
“I have a pretty good knowledge of masks,” Foy said. “Most of what I call ‘seasonal stores’ that only come in for one month out of the year just don’t have that.”
But that’s not to say that he doesn’t think seasonal stores have their place. Just the opposite, in fact.
“These seasonal stores are important because there are communities that would never see Halloween stores otherwise,” Foy said. “They have a purpose, and in my mind what the purpose is, is bringing Halloween all across the United States. If we only had small stores or costume stores in there year ‘round, it wouldn’t give everybody a chance to dress up. The seasonal stores are everywhere. They’re in every community.”
He acknowledged that Foy’s is not necessarily for everyone.
“Not everybody is so into it that they come here, but I think most people, if they’re into Halloween, they come here,” Foy said. “But if you just want a little item and you don’t want to come here and enjoy the whole Halloween experience, maybe you’ll go in [the seasonal store] just to get something. But I believe if you’re really into Halloween, you’ll come here because we have the selection, we have the knowledge.”
And Mike does strive to maintain a symbiotic relationship with what some would call his competitors.
“When you go into a place that’s only there five weeks and they’re going to be doing something else in five weeks … I don’t think they have the knowledge,” Foy said. “But we do send people there, and they send people to us … If I don’t have something, I’ll send them there. If they don’t have something, they usually send them to us. I want a relationship with them.”
Foy realizes that his station in life is unique and does not take the delight he finds in his occupation for granted
“I love what I’m doing, and I have fun at work,” he said. “To like what you do, that’s good. I can’t wait to get here in the morning!”
The joy in the Foy family seems to be hereditary, because Mike Foy, Jr. possesses the same zeal for the business as his father, and his grandfather before him, and his great-grandfather before him.
“He’ll want to do what his great-grandfather did,” Mike said of his son, who is now 16. “He loves it!”
The Foy family traditions reach deep.
“My dad had one child in his life, and he was 37 when I was born. I was 37 when my son was born. Like I told you, I don’t like much change. And that’s all just a coincidence, but I tell [Mike Jr.] all the pressure is on him,” Foy joked.
As for the zombie pirates at the corner of Main and Maple? You can stop by and see them and all of the Foy’s displays anytime you like, free of charge. That’s just the kind of empire Foy is running.
“That’s what I like, I like to entertain them,” he said. “You don’t have to spend a dollar to come here … I just want to get better at it,” Mike said. “And I think we get better every year.”
This business model, based on having a passion for what you do and being the best you can be at it, has kept Foy’s going for the better part of a century, and will keep it going for generations to come.
Foy’s Variety Store is located at 18-20 E. Main St. in downtown Fairborn. For additional store locations and hours, please visit FoysHalloweenStore.com

A well-executed printing campaign can yield a significant return. One of the most effective ways to gain the eye of your target audience is to create a printed piece that engages more than normal. Printed pieces implement anything from a unique fold to a scratch off to get a customer to respond to the call to action.
Creative use of elements such as QR Codes or Augmented Reality (clickable print) increase the focus time your marketing piece receives. Generally, if a customer handles your printed piece longer, they will retain your message more effectively. Combining interesting effects, like a die cut and a QR Code can increase the impact.
This original printed card for The Cornell Lab of Ornithology combines a colorful design and an unusual shape to encourage interaction with the piece. They took it one-step farther by incorporating three unique QR Codes that provide more information to the recipient. This tactic is an excellent way to be both memorable and informative.

However, with dark clouds still looming over the smaller 787-8 due to recent issues, it is little surprise that Boeing opted for a low-key rollout on this occasion.
Still, that hasn’t stopped The Aviation Writer from getting its hands on a cool video of the rollout, which was uploaded on Vimeo by amateur photographer and self-confessed aviation nut Liz Matzelle.
At the moment, the aircraft is painted in a simple Boeing livery (which actually looks great on the bird), but it will eventually feature the Air New Zealand livery, as the national carrier is the 787-9 launch customer.

What do you think of the Boeing 787-9? Does it look better than the 787-8? Stay tuned for more updates on the forthcoming aircraft, with an inaugural test flight expected next month. We cannot wait!

Eat that Airbus!
Watch out for the batteries...
Boeing is the best...
Just have extra fire extinguishers handy ;)
I don't get all this fuss over the 787, or most of the other airline type aircraft. The A-380 is the monster of the skies at the moment. Why airlines would use a smaller aircraft for overseas travel doesn't make sense.
Thats because they don't have the capacity on those particular routes or the airports don't have the facilities to handle the A380. Cheaper to fly 200 passengers on a 787 than 200 passengers on an A380. So if u can't fill it, don't buy it.
Airlines operate to make profit.. and aviation fuel is 1/3 of the operating costs, to operate the A380, it has to be more almost 2/3 full before it starts to make a profit. A large aircraft means higher operating costs and more fuel, a smaller aircraft full to capacity is more profitable than a large aircraft operating below full capacity.
Dear James,
It is not always the size that matters. Both, Airbus and Boeing have a different outlook on the future requirements of the aircraft by the airlines to cater to passenger demand. But this is more than just about passengers perception of the airplane. Airbus is of the opinion that in future many travelers will opt to travel through mega hub cities by taking one stop, hence a need for a larger aircraft such as an A380 that can fly more passengers in relatively fewer frequencies. While, Boeing on the other hand asserts that instead of taking long haul journeys, passengers would prefer to travel in short-medium distances, also called as point-to-point in aviation parlance. But yes the questions remains about who will eventually be correct, because both the OEMs are catering to the same market. Both the airplanes have been designed with sophisticated engineering, with special emphasis on the human well being during the flight.
I like the part when it's coming out on the streets!
It looks lovely but is it safe? Have all the problems been solved. So far it has caught fire on ground, or nearly on ground but what happens if it catches fire in the air?
I hope it is with no battery issues....
The B788 problem is not yet solved...
Every new design has teething problems, the B777 also had its share, the A380 had cracks on the wings and an engine exploded in flight. The difference is that Boeing is getting a lot of negative publicity. I believe the 787 is a sound design and will ultimately prove its worth.
Will it have all the teething problems the first model has?Coach Chuck Pagano opening statement:
"As far as injuries go, pretty mild. Darius Butler went out with an ankle. They're going to check him tonight. Didn't require an x-ray or anything like that. Saw him at halftime, so we just pulled him out precautionary-wise. It doesn't look like much. (Greg) Toler, right before that second deep ball when (Marcus) Burley came in and defended that deep ball pass, he just banged a knee. He's going to be fine. Art (Jones) came out but went back in. He just got the wind knocked out of him. Good football team. We knew it was a good football team coming in here. Credit the Saints, they did a fantastic job on both sides of the football.. We just didn't do the fundamental things. We’re more than capable, and we've seen that. We've got a really good defense. We've got a chance to be a really good defense, but we've got to do the little things. They did the little things better than us. They were fundamentally sound when we weren't tonight. Offensively, we generated only one touchdown drive in the first half and struggled there. Came out in the second half, at least they came out and fought, made it a football game, gave ourselves a chance at the end to go win that thing. Unfortunately, it didn't work out. We’ll look at the tape like we always do. Won't rush to judge anything at this point, but we know we've got some things to clean up. We’ll get back to work on Monday."
Were you surprised at the high number of missed tackles you guys had tonight?
"Again, I go back and I credit them. They did a nice job. We'd hold him, hold him, then they'd squirt out on us and get a cutback or we'd overrun something, poor communication whatever it was. We haven't tackled well to this point. It goes both ways. They got good runners and we didn't do a good job of that. We’ll go back to the drawing board and emphasize it moving forward. I know we can tackle. We tackled better in the second half. Just fundamental football, we’ll get better."
Why did the offense seem so out of sync?
"Well, you always look at, again, who you go against. It's a darn good defense front to back. They've got playmakers all over the place, so that has a little bit of something to do with it obviously. We just, again, I go back to it, fundamental football, blocking, throwing, catching. Just do the little things, getting lined up right. I think we only had three penalties. A couple of them were just friendly fire stuff, just getting lined up right. So again, whatever it was, we’ll look at the tape and see what we need to do moving forward to get that fixed."
Reggie Wayne was on the field for the first time in almost a year tonight. What were your thoughts on that?
"It was tremendous. For him, and anybody that has the opportunity and goes through something like that, especially Reggie at his age, being able to rehab and be back on the football field. You get great football players, guys that love the game like Reggie loves the game. We've got a bunch of them in that locker room that are very, very passionate about football. When it gets taken away from you and you have an opportunity to come back, it's a great thing. It's an emotional thing. I know for Reggie it was awesome. For all of us, it was great to see him back out there and get a little burn as we like to call it so that was good."
Tight End Coby Fleener
How wide open were you on that touchdown?
“Nobody covered me so that makes my job real easy. I think the credit really goes to the offensive line and the quarterback. They gave him a great amount of time and he made a great throw.”
You know how much it costs to dunk a football over the goal post so you saved yourself some money?
“Yeah, far more then I can afford, I can guarantee that.”
Was that a tribute to
“Yeah, I think so. He got a kick out of it and we talked after the game. He’s a great guy."
He played pretty well at your position.
“Absolutely. Definitely a guy to look to and learn from.”
Three games in now, how do you balance the way you guys have played in each game as to where you’re at overall?
“I don’t really think you can say that the win-loss record is a true indication of how you play during the regular season. There’s always stuff you can learn from to get better at. Hopefully, it doesn’t return in the regular season.”
Quarterback Chandler Harnish
Is hurting yourselves with penalties a source of concern?
“No, absolutely not. We got a lot of great players, great vets, good young guys and a very good offensive line. That’s not a concern, but it’s something we definitely need to correct, watch the film and go back to work.”
What was it like to see Reggie Wayne come back out on the field?
“I tell you what, there was a lot of excitement from the crowd during that introduction phase. It was great to see him come out, get a couple catches right away and he looked like Reggie as we know him. It was awesome.”
Quarterback Andrew Luck
What did you think of the performance of the offense in the first bit of extended playing time?
“Disappointed in myself. Missed some throws, interception. We didn’t establish a good rhythm. We did some good things as well though, we did get a touchdown drive. The two-minute drive, a lot of good things until we get stuck down at the goal line. We need seven points there, we’ve got to find a way to get seven. So good to get out, get the work. A lot of mistakes, I know I made a lot of mistakes that need to be corrected if we’re going to have a chance to be a good offense. It will be a good couple of weeks of work for Cincinnati and then the start of the regular season.”
Were you surprised that you underthrew Coby Fleener as much as you did on that interception?
“No, just a bad throw. Not surprised, surprised would be the wrong way to describe it. Just a really bad throw.”
How nice was it to have Reggie Wayne out there playing with you?
“It was great. I know the fans were excited and I know everybody on the sidelines was excited, and we were excited on the field to have him out there. Good for him to get some touches and get hit I think, and I’m sure you guys could ask him about it and get a better answer. He always has that great look in his eye when he’s on the football field. It’s very, reassuring might not be the right word, but it’s great to play with. It’s great to play with guys like him.”
How far in advance did you know the first play was going to Reggie Wayne?
“I had an inkling from the moment he started working back to get ready, when he came back the first play would go to Reggie Wayne. But I knew sort of set in stone, not set in stone because nothing is ever really set in stone, but I had a really good idea on Thursday night there was a chance of that.”
Knowing you may not play in the fourth preseason game, how do you feel now about the offense and the team going into the regular season?
“Yeah, definitely on the right path, the right direction. I’m sure we’re all disappointed in our effort, I shouldn’t say effort, but our production tonight. Guys gave great effort, but I know I made too many mistakes. I’m looking forward to getting back on the practice field and starting it off. We know we’ve got the Cincinnati game and obviously the start of the regular season, and we’ve got to take advantage of the days of work that we have to go out and correct those mistakes and get better as a football team.”
You guys have used the no huddle to get in a rhythm during the preseason, but not so much tonight. Do you think that’s something you’ll go back to in the regular season? How much has that been a factor for you?
“Yeah, the no huddle has been great. I still think we employed it a fair amount tonight. It’s obviously Coach Pep’s (Hamilton) and Coach (Chuck) Pagano’s decision on how we do it and what we do. Guys have gone a good job no huddle and guys have done a great job huddling up and playing a more traditional rhythm of a game. So I think we’re prepared for both.”
Wide Receiver Reggie Wayne
The crowd definitely appreciated you. Did you hear the cheers when you were introduced?
“I did and I appreciate them..”
The first play goes to you, was it designed that way?
“I’m not sure. You might want to talk to them. I just wait for my number to be called and that was an opportunity for my number to be called. I just wanted to make sure I caught it and got what I can.”
You catch two and then they take them away on penalties. Were they working against you?
“That’s what teammates are for. I was already messing with T.Y. (Hilton) saying who are you working for? You’re on the other side with the officials, but thankfully, it was the preseason and it didn't hurt anything. It was good to catch the football and get a real live game under my belt. There’s no way you can simulate that. That’s what I said last week. It was an opportunity for me to go out there and there was some real live bullets flying at me so it was good, one down.”
When did you find out you were going to play and what was your reaction when Chuck Pagano said alright, let’s go play tonight?
“He came to me yesterday and said we’re going to see how you feel in the morning. I told him cool so I went home and prayed about it, had a real good night sleep, about 12 hours in preparing myself and I couldn't tell you the last time I got 12 hours of sleep. I woke up this morning, I saw him, he asked me how I felt, I said pretty good and he said alright, let’s see where this thing’s at. I finally got that call out the bullpen and I was able to come out and do what I can to help.”

At a Congregational meeting on Sunday, June 23, 2013, the congregation approved the Pastor Nominating Committee's recommendation that The Reverend Doctor John Cecil Brearley be called as the next Senior Minister of First Presbyterian Church. Dr. Brearley will begin serving the First Presbyterian Church of Myrtle Beach in August.
Dr. John Brearley and his family are relocating from Greenville, SC, where he has served as senior pastor at the John Knox Presbyterian Church for the last 17 years. Prior to his call to John Knox Presbyterian, John served as pastor at Elkin Presbyterian Church in Elkin, NC, from 1989-1996 and as associate pastor at Bethesda Presbyterian Church in Camden, SC, from 1985-88. John earned his undergraduate degree from Presbyterian College, his Master of Divinity from Union Theological Seminary, and his Doctor of Ministry from Columbia Seminary. He also participated in post graduate study in Scotland at the University of Edinburgh. For over two decades he has also participated in the Reformed Theology Group and the Preaching Seminar at Montreat. Dr. Brearley currently serves as Vice Chair of the Presbyterian Homes of South Carolina. He was moderator of the Foothills Presbytery in 2010-2011 and currently serves on its Committee on Ministry.
To know John and Tammy Brearley is to love them. The couple grew up in the same church and schools in Columbia, SC. They began dating in high school and married while John was in seminary. Tammy taught third grade at Christ Church Episcopal School in Greenville for the last eleven years. The Brearleys have four outstanding children. Their daughter Meg has just completed her first year as a history teacher at Lexington (SC) High School. She and her husband, Paul Greathouse, were married in the summer of 2012. The Brearleys’ daughter Lauren is a practicing attorney in Columbia, SC. Their son Michael and wife Erin live in Nashville where Michael attends the Vanderbilt Law School and Erin teaches music. Following in the footsteps of her siblings John and Tammy’s youngest child, Caroline attends Furman University.
John comes from a long and distinguished line of Presbyterian ministers. His grandfather, Dr. Cecil Brearley, organized the founding of our church, The First Presbyterian Church of Myrtle Beach, in 1928 while serving as pastor of Kingston Presbyterian Church in Conway. Tammy also has deep family ties to the Myrtle Beach area. Her father, Gene Lewis, grew up in Conway. Her mother, Peggy Nigh Lewis, lived in Myrtle Beach and attended First Presbyterian Church of Myrtle Beach.
Hailing from the small rural community of Barbeque, North Carolina, Cam Thomas considers himself one of the foremost unofficial barbeque ambassadors on the Eastern Seaboard. After earning a BA in History from the University of North Carolina at Wilmington, Cam spent four years as a high school teacher and football coach at Western Harnett High School in Lillington, North Carolina. It was there that he became reacquainted with Mary Melissa Goodnight whom he had first met and fallen in love with while in the third grade.
As coach of the school tennis team, Mary needed a driver to transport her players to matches, and Cam just happened to have his bus license. While spending hours together at tennis courts all over eastern North Carolina, Cam and Mary became good friends, and over time they fell in love. Following a beach proposal at Bald Head Island, the couple was married on August 7, 2010.
Cam and wife Mary moved to Richmond, Virginia, where Cam entered Union Seminary. In 2014, The Pastor Nominating Committee at First Presbyterian Church contacted Cam Thomas and then invited him and Mary to visit FPC. It was very clear that Cam Thomas was a perfect fit for the First Presbyterian Church of Myrtle Beach. At a congregation meeting on Sunday, April 27, the PNC recommended Cameron W. Thomas and nominated him as Associate Pastor of the First Presbyterian Church of Myrtle Beach, SC. The congregation voted to accept the nomination.
On May 31, 2014, Cam earned his Master of Divinity degree. He and Mary packed their belonging and moved to Myrtle Beach. Cam was ordained on Sunday, August 3 at his home church, in Barbeque, NC.
Cam also has certification and experience in patient counseling through Virginia Commonwealth University in Richmond.
Ever the adventurers, Cam and Mary have explored many areas of the country, including the Grand Canyon and Sedona in Arizona and more recently, a frozen-over Lake Erie. Their sidekick on many of these adventures is Zeb, an affectionate and mischievous Walker Treeing Coonhound whose talents include hunting down the warmest spot on the couch. Zeb, Cam, and Mary enjoy spending time together and with friends and family, sharing meals, jokes and stories. On sunny days you can find them on local jogging trails, bike paths, or the beach.
On Sunday, September 21, The Reverend Cameron Thomas was installed as Associate Pastor, Youth & Missions, at First Presbyterian Church, Myrtle Beach, SC during the 11:00 AM worship service.
Born and raised in Carmichael, California, a suburb of Sacramento, Christa’s father, David, worked for the California Transportation Commission and her mother, Phyllis, was a Kindergarten teacher (both now happily retired). She is the younger of two daughters. Older sister, Karen, lives in Grand Rapids, Michigan with husband, Mike, and two children, son, Steven, and daughter, Megan. Christa currently lives with her sweet leopard gecko, Lily.
After graduating from high school with an International Baccalaureate diploma, Christa attended Stanford University and earned a BA in Classics and Economics in 2001. With plans to go into Egyptology and the study of classical economies, God called Christa to instead explore vocational ministry. She served as college ministry intern at First Presbyterian Church, Winston-Salem, North Carolina from 2001-2002. During that time, Christa sensed a call to pursue vocational ministry. As the time had passed to apply for seminary that year, Christa worked as an administrator of a financial services company before enrolling at Princeton Theological Seminary in 2003.
While at Princeton, Christa agreed to take a year-long internship as assistant minister at Groomsport Presbyterian Church in Northern Ireland and added an M.A. in Christian Education to her studies. She served as a chaplain to Stanford Hospital and Lucille Packard Children’s Hospital for her Clinical Pastoral Education, served a pastoral intern to three churches in Charleston, West Virginia, and served as a summer assistant minister to two small rural churches in Mountmellick and Tullamore in the Republic of Ireland. Additionally, Christa served for three years as the editorial assistant for Theology Today, the internationally acclaimed theological journal produced at Princeton seminary. In 2008, Christa graduated from Princeton Theological Seminary with a M.Div. and a M.A. in Christian Education.
After graduation, Christa served as volunteer intern at Mercer County, New Jersey chapter of the National Alliance on Mental Illness. In November 2008, she was called as Associate Pastor at The Woodlands Community Presbyterian Church, The Woodlands, Texas, a suburb of Houston. There she concentrated on adult education and discipleship, mission, pastoral care, and worship. From 2010-2012, Christa studied at San Francisco Theological Seminary, earning her Diploma in the Art of Spiritual Direction, thus certifying her as a spiritual director.
In 2014, Christa accepted a call as Associate Pastor to First Presbyterian Church of Myrtle Beach, South Carolina. She was introduced to the congregation on November 1, 2014 and installed during the 11:00 AM worship on Sunday, February 15, 2015.
Christa has served on a New Church Development Committee; Committee on Preparation for Ministry, led retreats, and most important to her, the colleague group of young pastors that she and a friend started in 2010 which continues to meet monthly. She plays the flute, enjoys world travel, Irish dancing, counted cross-stitch, reading, hiking, and exploring her surrounding community.
Reared in China by missionary parents, Howard earned his Associate, Bachelors, Masters, and Doctorates' from Princeton University, University Of Pittsburgh, Nyack College, and Pittsburgh Theological Seminary. He served several churches in Pennsylvania (Pittsburgh area) and New Jersey. Dr. Hansen and his wife, Alice Marie, have three children, L. SuZann, Kevin, and Evan. He now serves as part-time Parish Associate Minister at First Presbyterian.
Rev. Judith (Judy) Cettei joined the pastoral staff in January, 2014 as a part-time Parish Associate. Judy graduated from Elizabethtown College in Pennsylvania with a B.A. degree in German/Russian. After teaching for a few years, she joined her husband as owner and operator of McDonald’s restaurants. In 2002 Judy finally answered God’s call to a life of pastoral ministry and graduated from Union Presbyterian Seminary in Richmond, VA. After seminary she was the solo pastor of the Lake City Presbyterian Church and McDowell Presbyterian prior to Lake City. She retired from serving the Lake City Presbyterian Church in 2012 and continued her work for New Harmony Presbytery. Judy served on Dr. John Brearley’s Installation Committee in the fall of 2013 and offered to help with pastoral care and worship leadership. Judy and her husband, Mike, live in Georgetown and are the proud parents of Lara (Miles) Adler, Pawleys Island, SC and Matthew (Kim) Cettei, San Jose, CA. They have five wonderful grandchildren, ages 1-12. Judy and Mike feel like they’ve “come home,” as they were members of FPC in 1983-86, when they first moved to South Carolina from Pennsylvania.

RALEIGH – The thing about momentum is that it doesn’t begin from a standing start. Like a tractor trailer chugging up a hill, it rolls out slowly and eventually picks up speed as it goes along.
The same can be said for a college basketball season.
It’s one thing to play well in November and December, and even into January when the conference schedules begins. But those games are only mere preliminaries to help get the ball rolling for the games that really mean something at the end.
With just three weeks left in the regular season, those games are rapidly approaching. And for the first time since its upset of Duke more than a month ago, it finally appears as though N.C. State might just be gaining some momentum for a big finish.
It started with Scott Wood’s saving 3-pointer in the final second at Clemson and continued with a closer-than-it-should-have been overtime win against Virginia Tech. Tuesday, the Wolfpack took another step forward with a convincing 84-66 win against Florida State at PNC Arena.
No, these aren’t the same Seminoles that won the ACC tournament championship last year. Far from it.
But that’s the point.
Unlike most of its recent games, State didn’t play down to the level of its competition. This time it got off to a strong start and kept the hammer down on both ends of the court until the finish – outrebounding FSU 45-21 and getting a career-high 31 points and 13 rebounds from freshman T.J. Warren for its most lopsided ACC victory of the season.
“We needed a game like this,” said coach Mark Gottfried, whose Wolfpack improved to 19-7 overall (8-5 ACC). “We needed to play well and feel good about how we played. It was an important game for us tonight.”
That importance goes beyond the final score and the impact it had on keeping State in position to claim one of four first-round byes to the upcoming league tournament.
One of the most positive aspects of the victory came on the boards, where the Wolfpack showed it can still be dominant even when center Richard Howell isn’t his usually consistent self.
With their lowpost workhorse limited to just seven rebounds – four below his ACC-leading average – Warren and C.J. Leslie combined to take up the slack with 23 between them. That includes 14 off the offensive glass, leading to a whopping 29 second-chance points.
“Coach Gottfried has been stressing on me that I need to start rebounding and crash the glass on every single possession,” Warren said. “That’s what I wanted to do tonight.”
That’s the main reason Gottfried put the 6-foot-8 forward into the starting lineup in place of struggling guard Rodney Purvis. The offense he provided turned out to be a bonus.
Warren came to State with the reputation for being a prolific scorer. He showed why Tuesday, making 12 of 15 field goals, including his first two 3-pointers since Jan. 26 and all five free throws in a productive 31 minutes.
His contribution, combined with the recent improvement of fellow rookie Tyler Lewis, gives the Wolfpack an added dimension – not to mention a deeper rotation – heading down the stretch.
“Sometimes a freshmen, they’re up and they’re down, they’re up and they’re down.” Gottfried said. “(Warren) got an opportunity to step into the lineup tonight and I thought he took advantage of it.
“I’ve told all three of those freshmen all year long that for our team to be great, all three of (them) need to play well. Tonight happened to be T.J.’s opportunity and he was very good.”
But he wasn’t the only one. With Leslie adding 19 points and 10 rebounds, Wood hitting three more 3-pointers – including the 300th of his career – and point guard Lorenzo Brown handing out nine assists, the Wolfpack looked a lot like the team that won 10 straight before hitting some hard times in mid-January.
State will try to pick up even more momentum Saturday in an emotional rivalry rematch with North Carolina in Chapel Hill.
“You always want your team to be playing its best basketball in late February and March,” Gottfried said. “Hopefully we can continue to improve and play well.”
With this team, of course, you just never know. If nothing else, though, at least Tuesday’s performance was a promising way to start.

C002847CR and C011876CR; A117220 (Control) and A117851
Appeal from Circuit Court, Washington County.
Suzanne M. Upton, Judge.
On appellant's petition for reconsideration and request for leave to file supplemental briefing filed April 23, 2004, and appellant's petition for reconsideration and memorandum in support filed June 1, 2004. Opinion filed April 21, 2004. 193 Or App 164, 90 P3d 636 (2004).
Peter A. Ozanne, Executive Director, Office of Public Defense Services, Peter Gartlan, Chief Defender, and Jamesa J. Drake, Deputy Public Defender, for petitions and supplemental briefing filed January 18, 2005.
Hardy Myers, Attorney General, Mary H. Williams, Solicitor General, and Jonathan H. Fussner, Attorney-In-Charge, Criminal Appeals Unit, for supplemental brief filed February 10, 2005.
Before Haselton, Presiding Judge, * and Linder and Ortega, Judges.
LINDER, J.
Reconsideration allowed; sentences on counts 1 and 2 in case number C002847CR vacated; remanded for resentencing; otherwise affirmed.
*Haselton, P. J., vice Deits, Judge pro tempore
LINDER, J.
Defendant appealed three convictions for unlawful delivery and possession of a controlled substance, ORS 475.992. After defendant filed a brief pursuant to State v. Balfour, 311 Or 434, 814 P2d 1069 (1991), and ORAP 5.90, we affirmed his convictions without opinion. State v. Allen, 193 Or App 164, 90 P3d 636 (2004). Defendant now asks us to reconsider our decision, raising two arguments based on United States Supreme Court cases that were decided after his brief was filed. We grant the petition for reconsideration. On reconsideration, we affirm defendant's convictions but vacate the sentences on two of his convictions and remand for resentencing.
First, relying on Crawford v. Washington, 541 US 36, 124 S Ct 1354, 158 L Ed 2d 177 (2004), defendant argues that the state introduced hearsay evidence at trial that violated his constitutionally protected right to confrontation. Defendant was charged with and convicted of several drug-related offenses. At trial, the state introduced a laboratory report detailing the nature and quantity of the controlled substances in question. Defendant did not object to the evidentiary use of that report. On appeal, however, he argues that its admission into evidence, without the accompanying testimony of the expert who prepared it, violated his constitutional confrontation rights under Crawford and was plain error. For the reasons identified in State v. Thackaberry, 194 Or App 511, 516-17, 95 P3d 1142 (2004), rev den, 338 Or 17 (2005), however, the asserted error is not apparent on the face of the record, nor is it an error that we would exercise our discretion to review. On reconsideration, therefore, we reject defendant's argument that it was plain error under Crawford to admit the report, and we affirm defendant's convictions.
As a second ground for reconsideration, defendant argues that his sentences violated his constitutional right to a jury under Blakely v. Washington, 542 US ___, 124 S Ct 2531, 159 L Ed 2d 403 (2004). The trial court imposed upward departure sentences on two of defendant's convictions for unlawful delivery and possession of a controlled substance, citing defendant's "persistent involvement unrelated to current crime" and his parole status at the time of this offense. (1) Defendant argues that the imposition of the upward departure terms based on facts that were not proved to a jury beyond a reasonable doubt renders his sentences unconstitutional under Blakely. In so arguing, defendant concedes that his argument is unpreserved but contends that we should review it as plain error.
Under our decision in State v. Perez, 196 Or App 364, 102 P3d 705 (2004), defendant's plain error argument is well founded. We observed in Perez that a sentence can lawfully be increased beyond the maximum otherwise authorized, without a jury's determination of the aggravating factor, when the increase is based on the "bare fact" of one or more prior convictions. Id. at 371. But we concluded that a finding of "persistent involvement" requires an inference that goes beyond the mere existence of a criminal record because it captures "'a separate malevolent quality in the offender represented by the repetitive nature or pattern of the offender's criminal behavior over and above simply counting the number of offenses in an offender's criminal history.'" Id. at 372-73 (citation omitted). The same is true of a defendant's probation or parole status when he committed the offenses of conviction: "the issue whether a previous term of parole or probation 'failed to deter' defendant from committing further offenses" goes beyond the bare fact of a prior conviction and the sentence for it. Id. at 371-72. Where a defendant does not admit such aggravating factors, and the state does not prove them beyond a reasonable doubt to a jury, imposition of a departure sentence in reliance on those factors is plain error that requires us to vacate the departure sentence and remand for resentencing.
That is the appropriate remedy in this case. To be sure, as the state points out, defendant testified that he previously had been convicted of numerous crimes, and copies of the judgments of conviction for some of those crimes were admitted in evidence. Defendant also identified the person serving as his parole officer at the time of his current offenses. Thus, the state is correct that defendant effectively "admitted" his criminal record and his parole status.
But that is all that defendant admitted. As Perez discusses, an upward departure based on "persistent involvement" or parole status requires further inferences about the malevolent quality of the offender and the failure of his parole status to serve as an effective deterrent. Defendant did not admit those further facts. He therefore was entitled to have a jury determine whether those inferences were appropriate to draw by a standard of proof beyond a reasonable doubt. (2)
In addition to challenging the upward departure sentences imposed on two of the convictions, defendant also challenges as plain error the trial court's order, as part of the sentences on all three of his convictions, that he would not be eligible for consideration for so-called "Senate Bill 936 credits" on his convictions (e.g., early release and sentence reduction programs). See ORS 137.750. In so ordering, the trial court relied on defendant's criminal record generally and the factors that caused the court to impose the upward departure sentences. Defendant argues that those portions of the sentences also are unconstitutional under Blakely and qualify as plain error. Defendant's challenge in that regard is moot as to the sentences on the convictions that we otherwise vacate and remand for resentencing (counts 1 and 2 in case number C002847CR). As to the sentence on the remaining conviction (case number C001876CR), the issue does not qualify as plain error. State v. Vigil, 197 Or App 407, ___ P3d ___ (2005).
Reconsideration allowed; sentences on counts 1 and 2 in case number C002847CR vacated; remanded for resentencing; otherwise affirmed.
1. The upward departure sentences were imposed on count 1 and count 2 in case number C002847CR. On a third conviction for possession of a controlled substance (case number C011876CR), the trial court imposed a dispositional departure sentence based on "the stipulation of the defendant." Defendant does not challenge the dispositional departure on that third conviction.
Return to previous location.
2. On the pertinent charges, defendant pleaded not guilty and was tried by the court after he waived his right to a jury. The record provides no basis for a conclusion that defendant, in waiving his right to a jury trial, did so knowing that he had the right to have a jury determine the aggravating factors. Defendant's waiver therefore did not render his sentence lawful. State v. Gornick, 196 Or App 397, 409, 102 P3d 734 (2004).

We asked our growing corps of Rapid Responders where they stood on the issue of whether to transfer Packy to a sanctuary. And we asked, "If it were yours to decide, would you eliminate zoos in Oregon?
RELATED STORY:Bob Barker joins call on Oregon Zoo to retire Packy
Here's what they wrote:
Elephants are intelligent and self-aware. They are not on earth to entertain us. Give Packy and other elephants retirement.
— Thomas P. Krise, Salem
How about we let Bob Barker live out his remaining years in a sanctuary, and leave Packy right where he is? Packy can continue to delight young and old alike, and Barker can go off somewhere and stop annoying people.
— Woody Tiernan, Dallas
Having just retired, and enjoying my "freedom" tremendously, I think it is time for Packy to retire also. Oh, the sights he'll see! And the joy he'll feel.
— Lew Hundley, Salem
All zoos should be sanctuaries. Plenty of room, with unobtrusive visitors. I would hold zoos to a higher standard.
— David Haber, Salem
Celebrities always get more attention than they deserve. Packy has had lifelong contact with people in his current location. He is well fed and carefully tended. Just leave him where he has spent his life.
— Jim Jaqua, Keizer
Packy is a real anomaly, a Republican on welfare and Medicaid! Probably not eligible for Capitol Manor. Zoos like those in Portland and Seattle serve as animal hospitals, educational institutions and refuges. It is the habitat destruction and poaching by humans that needs Barker's protection.
— Calvin Collins, Salem
Where will Packy receive the best care, objectively? Who will give him better food and more space to walk around? Wherever that is, put him there.
— Brit McGinnis, Portland
This is the only home Packy has known. Why take him away from familiar family and environment? I would not get rid of zoos. More and more zoos are making the animals' habitats more environmentally natural, which allows visitors to get a better understanding of how they live.
— Emily Duerfeldt, McMinnville
In 2013 the Oregon Zoo was rated one of the 10 worst for elephants by In Defense of Animals. All of the elephants there should go to a sanctuary. These are highly social animals. Packy has established relationships that shouldn't be broken. Oregon needs zoos, but they must treat animals humanely.
— Brian Hines, Salem
Now knowing that elephants are highly intelligent including having empathy and self-awareness, to not allow Packy his time in a sanctuary is inhumane. Eliminate Oregon zoos? Yes, zoos are inherently unethical. Better a few large habitat preserves in the U.S. that allow wild animals to exhibit their normal behavior.
— Gary Kertz, Salem
Zoos serve a vital function in the preservation of endangered species. Therefore, keep them open. As for Packy, keep him where he will get the best care. If a sanctuary can do better than the Oregon Zoo, then by all means let him go there.
— Dorian Atkins, Salem
Packy, Keiko, will we ever learn? All Packy knows is life in the zoo. All Keiko knew was life in aquariums. Packy should live out his years in a familiar environment, not moved away to start over as Keiko unfortunately was. I support both animal rights and responsible zoos.
— Patt Wilson, Keizer
Shutting down zoos doesn't make sense. Where are our children going to see a "real" elephant, wolf and orangutan? On the Internet? Our elephant population has contributed more knowledge about elephants than Barker did on anything. Perhaps we should shut down game shows.
— Claude Shinn, Salem
The Oregon Zoo is remodeling their elephant exhibit. Let Packy enjoy it. He has certainly earned it. As for zoos, they show and teach us about a wide array of animals. Without them, we would be without that wonderful chance to learn and see these animals.
— Tony Weaver, Woodburn
Kids enjoy zoos. I did as a child, but it's a money issue. What is it costing to run our zoos? Money is tight everywhere.
— Richard Kent Brady, Salem
Packy was born in the Portland zoo. It is all he knows. For all we know, he may be happy there. When I was a kid, and when my kids were young, we enjoyed a day at the zoo. It can be a fun learning experience.
— Teresa Larocque, Dallas
I tend to agree that Packy should be moved to a sanctuary. I would not eliminate zoos in Oregon. Zoos provide an educational experience as they allow people to see and learn about wild animals they might not otherwise have the chance to see.
— Harold Hans, Salem
If Packy is healthy and enjoying life at the Oregon Zoo, let's keep him here. As to continuing to have zoos here and elsewhere, I think they are a valuable educational asset, but must be managed well and provide care and habitat that is suitable and humane to the animals.
— Chet Zenone, Salem

Thermos Brand Kicks Off Multi-City #ThermosThursday Hydration Station Tour in Los Angeles, With Additional U.S. Stops to be Announced
SCHAUMBURG, Ill., Aug. 21, 2013 /PRNewswire/ -- Genuine Thermos® Brand recognizes the important role that water plays in our daily lives, and how everyday actions such as drinking water from a reusable container can make a world of difference, while keeping people energized, hydrated and healthy for an active life.
That's why on Thursday, Aug. 22, Genuine Thermos Brand will kick off its first #ThermosThursday Hydration Station in Los Angeles at The Grove located at 189 The Grove Dr., Los Angeles. Between 11 a.m. – 4 p.m., Angelenos are invited to bring their own bottles to fill up with fresh, clean water and to spin a prize wheel for the chance to win Thermos brand hydration bottles that will be filled up on the spot with drinking water to help them stay hydrated throughout the day – and for their future use to help make an environmental impact by using a reusable container.
"At Thermos we believe living green matters, so we're continuously developing products that provide on-the-go people with more sustainable choices. Carrying a reusable Thermos brand product -- instead of purchasing plastic water bottles – is a great way to stay hydrated and reduce the amount of waste sent to landfills," said Rick Dias, President and Chief Operating Officer, Thermos L.L.C.
Los Angeles marks the inaugural #ThermosThursday Hydration Station stop on a multi-city tour during some of the hottest months, August and September.
Tips for getting in the hydration habit
Enjoying fresh water out of a reusable container is one of the easiest changes you can make to help the environment, and your health. Genuine Thermos Brand offers the following tips for staying hydrated:
- Monitor your water intake to ensure you are receiving the proper amount of hydration. According to the Mayo Clinic, your body depends on water to flush toxins out of vital organs and carry nutrients to your cells. The Institute of Medicine has determined that adequate daily water intake is roughly 104 ounces for men and about 72 ounces for women.
- Take fresh water along with you in a reusable container to stay hydrated while on the go. You'll not only positively affect your health, but you'll also help to reduce environmental waste by eliminating the need for plastic water bottles that end up in landfills.
- A reusable container for water will also eliminate the need for paper or foam cups. According to the Environmental Protection Agency, Americans throw away 25 billion foam cups each year. Five hundred years from now, those cups will still be sitting in a landfill.
#ThermosThursday
During the year, Genuine Thermos Brand has taken over one of the best days of the week – Thursday – to commemorate the widespread and most popular uses of Thermos brand products. Each week, a celebration can be found at #ThermosThursday, along with special Thermos brand content on Facebook (facebook.com/Thermos) and Twitter (@Thermos). Consumers can win Genuine Thermos Brand products, learn about heritage items, get special retail promotions and pricing on Thermos brand products, and even experience Genuine Thermos Brand during events and milestones celebrated across the country..

And of these
four, three increased their shipments in last year, with only HP being the runt of the litter.
iSuppli attributes that to "teething pains" after it took over Compaq.
Nevertheless, despite the grip the big four retain on the market, Others Inc, that is to say the white box makers, managed to grow their presence in 2002 as well.
There were some big changes in operating systems shipped, claimed iSuppli. Linux OSes outsold Unix servers for the first time, and grabbed 15.5 per cent of software shipped, a growth from the previous year's 10.1 per cent.
Nevertheless Bill Gates' "Winders" operating system still has a huge chink of the market. Linux, said the firm, is now a big part of the high volume entry level server market because of its low cost and its "similarities" to Unix as far as tools, utilities, configs and operating procedues go.
The market research company said it sees server units continuing to grow throughout this year. µ1. “Be ruthless in editing your own stuff. One writer who worked for me described my editing style as ‘Texas Chainsaw Massacre,’ and I took that as a compliment.”

But as I continue to write it becomes increasingly apparent that my snappy metaphor is getting in the way of carrying my readers where I want them to go. So I reluctantly, painfully, delete it.”
3. “When you're stuck, do whatever gets you going. Taking a break helps. I used to put on a recording of bagpipe music, but that's just me.”

5. “Structure. Think about main blocks of the finished content. Maybe some business context, history, market situation, whatever. If you get stuck with one block, move on to another. We are not trying to write like Henry James — just clearly, interestingly, and hitting the key points.”

7. “I think that compliments No. 2: write first and edit later. That was a problem of mine early on, trying to craft rather than just letting it flow.

SNAP Press Release
Sex Abuse Victims Want To Address Nuns’ Group
National Sisters’ Organization Won’t Let Victims’ Speak
Self Help Group Also Wants Vatican Probe into Nuns Expanded
It Should Include Questions About Sex Abuse & Cover Up, SNAP Says
Men And Women Who Were Molested Want To Reach Out To Others Who’ve Been Hurt
What:
Outside the national headquarters of American nuns, clergy sex abuse victims will carry signs and childhood photos during a sidewalk news conference. They will
-- discuss their experiences of being molested by Catholic sisters,
-- prod the Catholic hierarchy to expand a new Vatican probe to include clergy sex abuse by nuns
They will also call on US nuns to
-- launch a self survey to learn how widespread such sex crimes are, and
-- let victims address the nuns’ annual national conference next week in New Orleans
When:
Monday, Aug. 10th, 1:00 p.m.
Where:
Outside Leadership Conference of Women Religious (LCWR) office, 8808 Cameron Street (corner of Fenton) in Silver Spring, MD
Who:
Four adults who were sexually abused by nuns, along with several members and supporters of SNAP (Survivors Network of those Abused by Priests), including the group’s founder and president
Why:
More and more, SNAP is hearing from men and women who were molested, as young kids and vulnerable adults, by nuns across the country. Yet nun officials have done little to determine just how widespread such sex crimes and misdeeds by Catholic sisters really is. Nor have the nuns responded compassionately to those victims who have come forward.
The United States Catholic Conference of Bishops had asked the nuns to adopt their sex abuse policy which bishops wrote up in 2002. (It's called the Dallas Charter or the Charter for the Protection of Children and Young People). The nuns refused to do so.
The Leadership Conference of Women Religious (LCWR) is t he largest association of Catholic women religious in the United States. In July 2004, a group of survivors of nun sexual abuse asked the LCWR to work with them and devise a plan of "hope, respect, and healing," which specifically would include:
• Reaching out & offering help to victim-survivors of nun sexual abuse;
• Letting survivors speak at the LCWR’s regional and national conferences; and
• Conducting an independent annual audit of nun sexual abuse.
The nuns again refused and refused every year since then.
The LCWR has more than 1500 members, and represents about 95% of the 68,000 women religious in the US. Few of these religious communities of women answer to the local bishops; instead the majority of these orders report to an obscure office in the Vatican.

Even though we’ve had Nespekashuti and his coffin since 1893, we have very little information in our database about him. Working on his remains in the Artifact Lab is providing an opportunity to take a much closer look and to learn more about him.
One of the first things we decided to do was to x-ray his remains using our new digital radiography equipment. Although Nespekashuti looks pretty well-wrapped (despite his teeth being exposed), this is what we see under the wrappings:
As you can see, there are some big empty spaces (areas that are completely black), especially the neck and upper chest area, and there are areas where bones are completely disarticulated and appear to be piled on top of each other. We’re not really sure why this would be, but we have some ideas. Dr. Janet Monge, our physical anthropologist, is currently taking a closer look at the x-ray images in order to draw some conclusions about the bones and their condition, which may help us better understand why they are a bit of a jumbled mess…not unlike another mummy we recently treated and x-rayed, Pinahsi.
In the meantime, I’ve started the conservation treatment, which I’ll be sure to report on as I make progress.Lord Of The Rings Online has always been one of my favorite MMOS. The game is visually stunning and has so much depth and detail it is impossible to ever run out of things to do and enemies to conquer. Now the fine folks at Turbine have raised the level of enjoyment to a new height, with the introduction of War-Steeds and mounted combat for the Riders of Rohan expansion. Welcome to a high speed thrill ride with LOTRO War-Steeds.
When last we met, I told you about my initial highly positive experiences during the first few days of the expansion and I promised to come back after I completed Book 8 of the epic quest and earned my own War-Steed. I do apologize for being slightly delayed by the dubious distinction of spending a considerable amount of time covering the 2012 elections and its aftermath, but I came back, leveled up my character and I now am the proud owner of Calista, my medium War-Steed.
War-Steeds come in three different versions that relate to the different player classes and their style of combat. As a burglar who wears medium armor and engages in melee combat, I prefer the medium War-Steed for a balance between speed, agility and survival.
Ranged players might use a light War-Steed with the best maneuverability and plate wearers may prefer the Heavy War-Steed for more armor and health. It should be mentioned that while you can use your War-Steed anywhere in the game for transportation, you can only use it for mounted combat in the new Riders of Rohan expansion zones.
Since Turbine is famous for the incredible detail they put into every aspect of Lord Of The Rings Online, it should come as no surprise that War-Steeds offer an amazing variety of options. Every combat mount uses its very own legendary bridle that you can fine tune just like any other legendary in the game. Players will earn points to add to the bridle’s legacies and legacies can be tweaked when you reforge your bridle.
For those players willing to invest a bit extra in the game, the item shop offers a great selection of high quality runes to add to your legendary bridle. You can also purchase a stunning assortment of decorative gear from the item shop that won’t add any benefits in combat but they will allow you to look incredibly dashing when you ride into town.
Once you acquire your War-Steed, you will have to complete the training quests to learn how to fight from horse back. At first, you may be slightly confused since you will now have a new set of tool bars with a whole new range of combat traits to use in mounted battles. Be patient, do the quests and before long you will be ready to venture out into the wide world to completely crush your enemies and listen to the lamentation of their women. (sorry, wrong game. I got carried away.)
Just like a player character, the War-Steed comes with a list of traits and its own trait tree. As they level up, steeds earn a total of 77 trait points that are spent on new mounted traits. Most of the points are gained in mounted combat but Turbine decided to be ultra generous and players even earn trait points for their mount when they kill enemies and complete quests on foot.
The trait tree has three branches; one for health and defense, one for damage and one for speed and maneuverability. The tree comes with two unlocked specs and five more you can unlock through the item shop. You can refund points and respec for a reasonable fee payable with game currency and you can choose a light, medium, or heavy mount for each unlocked spec. The depth and variety offered for your War-Steed is simply unbelievable.
Of course, the actual mounted combat is what we are all interested in and I will tell you that it is unique and exciting. Fighting on a War-Steed takes the player far beyond the typical keyboard face roll style of battle found in many online games. Once you master mounted combat, you will be able to kill mobs that would destroy you on foot, fight multiple enemies and even hold your own against mini bosses. The combat is high speed warfare from the back of an agile, armored mount and it offers a thrill a minute mad dash through the plains of Rohan.
Turbine has done the impossible and actually managed to introduce an exciting new method of play to online gaming. Join up with a few friends on their War-Steeds and you will will soon become an almost unstoppable force. Turbine deserves great praise for bringing War-Steeds to Lord Of The Rings Online. Bravo and a job well done!Latest Society of Exploration Stories

Before being hired by Apple in April of last year, Browett was the chief executive of British electronics retailer Dixons Retail. Browett was let go by Apple in October 2012 and is currently the chief executive of Monsoon Accessorize.
Browett’s six-month stint as Apple’s head of retail was controversial due to several cost-cutting measures he implemented for Apple Stores, including eliminating staff and reducing working hours for employees. As reported by The Independent, Browett feels that he learned to be a humbler and “much kinder person” from the experience.
Apple CEO Tim Cook’s selection of Browett for the job was surprising to many people familiar with Dixons’ retail culture, which is primarily focused on discount retail sales, rather than customer service. In an email response to a concerned Apple user reported by MacRumors last year, Tim Cook assured him that, “I talked to many people and John was the best by far. I think you will be as pleased as I am. His role isn’t to bring Dixons to Apple, [it’s] to bring Apple to an even higher level of customer service and satisfaction.”What is the definition of defensive driving?

Allotment holders will be charged £75 per plot, per year, based on an average plot of 300 sq. mtr. Multiple plot cultivators will be liable to pay double, treble or even more depending on the amount of plots they have. Non payers would suffer harsh penalties similar to Council Tax non payers. This will of course be on top of any charge the allotment holder pays already to their Local Authority or Organisation who rents the plots out.
It is understood that the revenue raised will be in excess of £20m. Gordon Brown was very clear on where the money would be spent.
With the rise of home grown cannabis in The UK. Advisers to The Government warned that allotments would be used for production of organic marijuana. And policing this would be particularly difficult without proper funding. Therefore the Government are in the process of setting up the Allotment Inspectors. The Allotment Inspectors will be given special powers to enter allotment sites at any time day or night to check no illegal plants are being grown.
Allotment Associations are said to be rather unhappy with the latest nonsensical tax dreamt up by the Government. Jasper Carrot ex comedian, Golden Balls presenter and Chairperson of his local Birmingham Allotment Association said on the matter, 'this is bleeding ridiculous. I've never come across any illegal activity in 30 years of allotmenteering. Even if we did we'd just call the police. The Government must take us for fools if they think we'd just do nothing if this kind of thing was going on. Now we're lumbered with an extra £75 bill and the chance that complete strangers in uniforms could turn up day or night and nick our prize veg'.
Jim Bean committee member of National Society for Allotments said, 'Gordon Brown is a cabbage, most allotment holders are cultivating for similar reasons they did during WWII. To grow their own nutritious food they could not necessarily afford otherwise. Forcing people to shell out and extra £75 will force low income families and pensioners off their plots. Turning vegetable growing on allotments into a middle class gardening pastime'.
Time will tell if gardeners around the country will just swallow this tax laying down or descend on Downing Street wielding garden Forks. But you can be sure there'll be thousands of unhappy gardeners nationwide when their tax bills drops through their letter boxes.Sad as their recent parting of ways is, Adrienne Maloof and her husband, Dr. Paul Nassif, are determined not to go through an ugly, public divorce.
The Real Housewives of Beverly Hills cast member and her plastic surgeon husband, who called it quits earlier this week, have three young sons.
While Adrienne wants full custody of their kids, she is genuinely sad, not bitter at Paul, and isn't planning to get nasty with her estranged spouse.
“Adrienne has so much class, she isn’t going to be trash talking Paul or airing out any of their dirty laundry,” a source close to the reality star said.
“She doesn’t want things to get ugly; she just wants a clean break.”
She may get it; Adrienne and Paul have an ironclad prenuptial agreement that no doubt safeguards her vast fortune in any divorce settlement.
Adrienne and Paul have been married for more than nine years and have starred on the hit Bravo reality show for the past three seasons.
She reportedly skipped the Real Housewives of Beverly Hills reunion taping this week because the news of her divorce was too fresh and painful.
"I'm so sorry that this is happening but my children are my life and sometimes we need to do what's best for them," she said earlier this week.

Mr. White has studied the backyard photographs for over 10 years. Mr. White received a B.A. in journalism major, history minor from the Texas Christian University in 1949. Currently, he is vice president of Witherspoon and Associates, Ft. Worth's largest advertising and public relations firm. Mr. White has served with Witherspoon in various capacities for over 25 years. He has done extensive work in all areas of reproduction, including photographic, mechanical, printing, and the graphic arts.Mr. White has lectured in the United States, widely on the subject of the backyard photographs. Mr. Chairman, I would note that Mr. White's testimony today will be split into two parts: The first dealing with the photographs, and the second in relation to the rifle. But it would be appropriate at this time, Mr. Chairman, to call Mr. White to testify on the backyard photographs.
Chairman STOKES. The committee calls Mr. White. Sir, please stand and be sworn. Do you solemnly swear the testimony you will give before this committee will be the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth, so help you God?
TESTIMONY OF JACK D. WHITE
Mr. WHITE. I do.
Chairman STOKES. Thank you. You may be seated. The Chair recognizes counsel, Mr. Genzman.
Mr. GENZMAN. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
Mr. White, will you state your full name and occupation for the record?
Mr. WHITE. Jack D. White, vice president of Witherspoon and Associates, an advertising and public relations firm.
Mr. GENZMAN. Will you please refer to the exhibits marked 179 and 180 which were previously entered into the record. Can you identify them?
Mr. WHITE. These are known as the backyard photos. Lee Harvey Oswald supposedly had them taken by his wife, Marina. They are Warren Commission exhibits 133-A and 133-B, and one which surfaced in 1975 during the Church committee hearings, which is marked 133-C.
Mr. GENZMAN. Have you analyzed any of these photographs?
Mr. WHITE. Yes; over a period of about 5 years.
Mr. GENZMAN. What led you to do this analysis?
Mr. WHITE. Well, in 1964 I read the Warren Commission report and I saw where Lee Harvey Oswald said these photos were fakes. Being in graphics myself, I thought I could do a good job of analyzing them.
Mr. GENZMAN. I-how much time did you spend on your analysis?
Mr. WHITE. It was over a period of about 5 years. I completed it probably about 3 years ago.
Mr. GENZMAN. Mr. White, what was your method of analysis?
Mr. WHITE. I utilized various methods. First of all was just scrutiny, you might say--just looking at the photos to see how things in one photo compared with things in the other photos. I also made measurements. I made photocopies and printed them in various sizes. I made transparencies which I overlaid one over the other to make certain comparisons, and things of that sort.
Mr. GENZMAN. Did you scrutinize various features in the photographs?
Mr. WHITE. Yes, in particular the face and the background.
Mr. GENZMAN. Did you scrutinize the body?
Mr. WHITE. Yes.
Mr. GENZMAN. What opinions have you formed about the backgrounds of the photographs?
Mr. WHITE. I believe the backgrounds in the three photographs you see here are virtually identical. I think they were all taken from a single camera viewpoint. The backgrounds would have had to be either a single photograph originally, or else the camera for all photographs would have had to be on a tripod or some other support for stabilizing the camera in one position.
Mr. GENZMAN. What opinions have you formed about the heads in the photographs?
Mr. WHITE. The heads in A and B are identical to one another with the exception of the lip area, which shows strong signs of retouching. I was not able to adequately compare the head on C to A and B because I did not have an adequate quality print at the time I made my comparisons.
Mr. GENZMAN. Thank you. What opinions have you formed about the heads in relation to the bodies?
Mr. WHITE. When you make the heads in A and B an identical size, the bodies are different lengths. In fact, all three bodies are slightly different lengths than each other if you make the heads the same size. For instance, if you make the heads the same size, you might say that A has a normal length body, B has a longer body, and C has a shorter body.
Mr. GENZMAN. Did you determine whether the heads and the bodies are of the same individual?
Mr. WHITE. I did not do any extensive analysis of the bodies. Some critics believe these are three different bodies. I have nothing to say about that, but I do believe that the heads on A and B are the person called Lee Harvey Oswald, down to a point right below the lips. In fact, the face is a single photograph. It is not two different photographs of the same individual. It is a single photograph.
Mr. GENZMAN. Did you determine whether the bodies were originally on the background of the photographs?
Mr. WHITE. In my opinion, the bodies have been superimposed on the background. There is some evidence of this. I can't prove it, but that is my opinion.
Mr. GENZMAN. Based on your findings, what is your conclusion about the backyard photographs?
Mr. WHITE. Well, just as Oswald said, I think they are fakes.
Mr. GENZMAN. Do you regard these fakes as sophisticated or crude?
Mr. WHITE. They are extremely sophisticated, although they are not so sophisticated that the fakery cannot be detected. I deal in the graphic arts area all the time in my job. We frequently deal with photographers, commercial artists, people who do this sort of work. If we were to undertake to fabricate a photograph like either of these, we would go to an expert to do it. We would get somebody who was an expert photographer, an expert artist, or a commercial art studio, because it is obvious that to fabricate the head onto the body and then the body onto the background, several sophisticated techniques must be used, including a matting process. Matting, for the people who don't know about graphics, involves the use of masks and a pin-register system so that you can exactly superimpose something onto a background without the superimposure being noticeable. What you do is take the figure that you are going to superimpose on the background, and you cut a mask around this figure. You make a positive and a negative of this, using one of them to outline the figure and the other to knock out of the background the area in which you want to print the figure. It is a very sophisticated procedure. It is not something that the average person could do. These were not made, in my opinion, by somebody with just a pair of scissors and some paste.
Mr. GENZMAN. Do you have an opinion as to whether Oswald hypothetically could have made these fakes?
Mr. WHITE. Even though he said to Will Fritz that he knew something about photography and could demonstrate how these photos were made. I don't think he could have acquired the expertise to fabricate them in the few months he worked at Jaggars Chiles-Stovall in Dallas.
Mr. GENZMAN. Why do you think these fakes were made?
Mr. WHITE. It is fairly obvious after the fact that they were made to implicate Oswald in the alleged assassination by tying him to the assassination weapon.
Mr. GENZMAN. Mr. White, did you testify earlier that each back-yard photograph has an identical background?
Mr. WHITE. That is my belief.
Mr. GENZMAN. At this time would you please refer to the exhibit marked JFK F-391.
Mr. Chairman, I would ask that JFK exhibit F-391 be entered into the record.
Chairman STOKES. Without objection it may be entered. [The information follows:]
JFK EXHIBIT F-391
Mr. GENZMAN. Mr. White, would you identify this exhibit?
Mr. WHITE. This is some art that I prepared using photographs 133-A and 133-B. Let's for a moment look at the lower portion, if you will start at the bottom. The brown picture that you see on the exhibit is a portion of 133-B. The red picture is the corresponding portion of 133-A, which is a red transparency overlaid over the brown picture. After printing these photographs to the same exact size in the darkroom and then having the red transparency made of A and laying it in register over photograph B, I then slipped a piece of white paper under the red transparency to block out the brown picture underneath. If you will notice, where the red corresponds to the brown along the edges of the slip of white paper, you will see that every portion of the background matches perfectly. Starting on the left of the picture, you see that the shadows are a perfect match, then the post is a perfect match. All the fence boards are a perfect match. When you get to the corner of the garage it is a perfect match. Even the branches of the bush match perfectly. Then to go to the center portion--which is at the upper part
Mr. GENZMAN. Mr. White, could you go over to the exhibit and point out these matches?
Mr. WHITE. All right. What I was referring to here--notice that the shadows all line up in one picture to the other. The post lines up. The fence palings all line up. The edge of the garage lines up. The branches of the bush all line up. Going to the upper part of the picture, again 133-B is in brown and 133-A is in red, and I have inserted a slip of white paper under the red to block out the brown. Notice here the steps line up perfectly. The post lines up. This shadow lines up. Coming across, this post lines up perfectly. The edge of the garage lines up here perfectly. Even the shadow along from the edge of the roof of the garage lines up perfectly. So I think we can safely say that the background of 133-B, which is in brown, is identical to the background of 133-A, which is in red. They have to be from a single camera viewpoint. If the camera moved side-to-side or up and down, you would not have such a match because you would have a different perspective.
Mr. GENZMAN. Mr. White, are the backgrounds exactly the same?
Mr. WHITE. There are a few very minor discrepancies. For instance, between A and B--it doesn't show here but over here it does--there is one reference point in the background which is so minutely out of adjustment that either the camera moved upward a fraction of an inch or downward a fraction of an inch between the two. But there is absolutely no side-to-side movement of the camera between the three pictures. If you will notice right here, there is a highlight on the corner of the house just beyond this stairway post. It is a bright sunlit highlight on the corner of the house. It is exactly the same size here, here and here in all three photos. If the camera had moved side to side or up and down significantly, you would not have the exact same foreground to background relationship between the post in the foreground and the corner of the house in the background. A very slight difference in movement would completely change the angle of perspective and you would not see three identical highlights.
Mr. GENZMAN. What might have caused the slight discrepancy which you mentioned?
Mr. WHITE. I can only think of two things and this is only speculation, of course. Being an artist myself, I recognized with everything else virtually identical in the picture, an artist fabricating this picture could have manipulated the background of this photograph A--or B for that matter, but I think it was A. All the area that is very slightly moved has straight edges around it--the stairway, the post, the fence and this post. It would be a very simple matter with a razor blade to slice this along these straight lines and move it up or down. Now, the other possibility is, and it perhaps is a little more likely than that one, that instead of this being a single identical, original background print, there could have been more than one back* ground print, but they all had to be taken from a fixed point like a tripod, or perhaps a camera resting on a car door or in the alleyway. If the camera was on a tripod, all the backgrounds would be identical so it would not make any difference how many they took. But if there was somebody driving through the alleyway and they paused long enough to rest the camera on the cardoor, then I can understand how the camera did not move at all side to side and therefore all of these reference points are identical, but possibly the camera tilted a fraction of an inch up or down in the taking, and therefore you might have had a different reference point here. This reference point I am referring to is the roofline of the house in the distant background. This post in the foreground, as related to the roofline in the background, would have varied widely if the camera had moved any significant distance. In fact, over the years researchers have taken thousands of photographs of this same situation. After viewing many of these photographs, including some made by the Dallas Police and FBI, as well as by numerous private researchers, and even though these people tried to find the exact same viewpoint of this photograph; by checking the foreground and background relationships I determined that no one could find this exact same spot. I have yet to see a photograph that had this reference point the same and that reference point the same, even though people were trying to find the location from which this photograph was made.
Mr. GENZMAN. Mr. White, did you testify earlier that the heads of these individuals in the backyard photographs are identical?
Mr. WHITE. Yes.
Mr. GENZMAN. In making this determination, which photographs did you study?
Mr. WHITE. I studied 133-A and 133-B, because up until 1975 I did not have 133-C, and when I did, it was only a magazine reproduction so I did not have a very good quality print to work with.
Mr. GENZMAN. At this time would you please refer to the JFK exhibits marked as F-270, F-392, and F-393.
Mr. Chairman, JFK exhibit F-270 was previously introduced into the record. I would ask that JFK exhibits F-392 and F-393 be entered into the record at this time. Chairman STOKES. Without objection, they may be entered in the record at this point. [The information follows:]
JFK EXHIBIT F-392
JFK EXHIBIT F-393
Mr. GENZMAN. Mr. White, would you identify these exhibits?
Mr. WHITE. Well, as I said, this one has previously been entered. The two exhibits here, 392 and 393, are artwork that I prepared in my study of these two photographs. Now these are what are called the 3-M color keys. They are red and blue transparencies of photographs 133-A and 133-B.
Mr. GENZMAN. Would you point out on these exhibits how you determined that the heads are identical?
Mr. WHITE. Well, I started it out with the prints of the two photos that I ordered from the National Archives. I then made photocopies of them and printed them to the same exact head measurement, the top of the head to the bottom of the chin, so that the head measurements would be the same. I then took these two prints to a photoengraver who shot a halftone negative and converted the photos to these red and blue prints that you see.
Mr. GENZMAN. Could you lift up the enlarged overlay to show each head?
Mr. WHITE. Yes. As you see here, entirely in red is the head on 133-B. Entirely in blue is the head on 133-A.
Mr. GENZMAN. Do the heads match exactly?
Mr. WHITE. The heads match identically with one minor exception which I will point out. All around the hair matches--the outside and inside edges of the hair. The eyebrows, the eyes, the ears, the nose, the nose shadow, the chin, all match exactly. There is no variation. However, the lips do vary. On 133-B notice the lips seem to be turned downward in a frown, and yet on 133-A, which is the blue one, the lips are turned upward in a smile. Now I am no expert in anatomy or physiognomy or whatever you want to call it, but my impression is that lips are connected to the face. I have tried this experiment in the mirror, and you can, too. Look in a mirror you will see if you change your lips from a smile to a frown other features on your face change. It is virtually impossible to move your lips without moving other features on your face.
Mr. GENZMAN. Why would there be this difference?
Mr. WHITE. I believe the original photo is probably the smiling photo. You can see strong evidence of retouching on B. I believe the lips on 133-B have been retouched so that the face would not appear to be absolutely identical to the other photo.
Mr. GENZMAN. Mr. White, did you testify earlier that in each backyard photograph one man's head is attached to another man's body?
Mr. WHITE. Yes.
Mr. GENZMAN. Where were these attachments made?
Mr. WHITE. Well, as Professor Blakey indicated in his narration, it is widely believed that the splice occurs in the line straight across the chin under the lip.
Mr. GENZMAN. Mr. Chairman, at this time I would ask that JFK exhibit marked "F-394" be entered into the record. Chairman STOKES. Without objection it may be entered into the record at this point. [The information follows:]
JFK EXHIBIT F-394
Mr. GENZMAN. Mr. White, would you explain this exhibit?
Mr. WHITE. This is another exhibit that I prepared. In the center you see the Dallas police mugshot of Lee Harvey Oswald. On the left side you see the face from 133-A. On the right side you see the face from 133-B. All these head sizes have been printed to the same size. Notice the chin on the Dallas police mugshot is a rather pointed chin with a slight dimple or cleft in it. You will notice the same thing on this other Dallas police photo of Oswald in custody on exhibit F-270. Yet, if we examine any of the faces in 133-A, B, or C, we see that the Oswald in the backyard photos has a broad, square, fiat looking chin with no cleft or no sharp point to it.
Mr. GENZMAN. Mr. White, did you analyze the shadows cast by the figures in the backyard photographs?
Mr. WHITE. Yes.
Mr. GENZMAN. Did you find any peculiarities?
Mr. WHITE. Yes, several.
Mr. GENZMAN. Would you please refer again to exhibit 391? That is the three sections of the overlays of A and B.
Mr. WHITE. Yes.
Mr. GENZMAN. Can you explain the top display of this exhibit?
Mr. WHITE. Yes. Again, this is the same exhibit we saw before in which 133-B is a brown picture and 133-A is a red transparency overlay to the same head size over the brown picture. In 133-A you will notice that the shadow of the nose of Oswald goes directly to the center of his lips. Notice that in 133-B, the shadow of the nose goes directly to the center of the lips. Yet when we overlay these two pictures, we find that the head has tilted 4 degrees approximately from the A picture to the B picture. Yet the nose shadow moves as the head tilts. In other words, in both pictures the nose shadow goes directly to the center of the mouth whereas when he tilted his head 4 degrees, the constant direction of the sunlight should have caused the shadow to move. As you can see in A by this red arrow here, the sunlight coming in this direction would cause the shadow to fall to the center of the lips. Yet, as he tilts his head, the sun would have had to move in the sky 4 degrees to compensate for the tilt of his head. All other shadows in the picture are identical. Notice the shadow on the post under the stairway. It exactly overlays from one picture to the other. This stairway shadow has not changed, and yet this nose shadow moved as the head moved.
Mr. GENZMAN. Mr. Chairman, on this I would ask that JFK exhibit F-395 be entered in the record.
Chairman STOKES. Without objection, it may be entered into the record at this point. [The information follows:] 41-371 O - 79 - 22 Vol. 2
JFK EXHIBIT F-395
Mr. GENZMAN. Mr. White, would you identify exhibit 395?
Mr. WHITE. Yes. This is another piece of art that I prepared. It consists of pictures A, B, and C all printed to the same background size. The main difference you notice in them, besides the fact that I have cropped some off the sides, is that I have positioned them according to the vertical reference points; in other words, you notice that some are higher or lower than others. Now I have positioned them so that the same point in the background is along the horizontal line in the three pictures.
Mr. GENZMAN. Did you notice any peculiarities on the shadows of these pictures?
Mr. WHITE. Yes. If you consider each photograph as if you are looking at the face of a clock, it is quite obvious that in 133-A the ground shadow of the figure is pointing to 10 o'clock. In 133-B, the ground shadow is pointing to 12 o'clock. In 133-C the shadow is again pointing to 10 o'clock, but even though the figure is shorter, it is casting a longer shadow; in fact, the shadow goes 6 or 7 inches up the fence.
Mr. GENZMAN. Thank you.
Mr. White, did you analyze the position of the body in backyard photograph A?
Mr. WHITE. Yes.
Mr. GENZMAN. Did you make a determination as to the body stance in 133-A?
Mr. WHITE. Yes, I think the body stance is in position out of balance with the background. If you compare the verticals in the background to the balance point of the body, you find that the figure could not be possibly standing in that position because it is out of balance. If you make a parallel line from the center of the chin that is parallel to this post in the background, you find that the point of balance falls approximately 3 to 4 inches outside the weight-bearing foot. You can try this yourself by suspending a plumb bob from your chin and in order to get it to fall at a point 3 or 4 inches outside your weight-bearing foot, you will be off balance and you will fall over.
Mr. GENZMAN. Based on this analysis, what is your conclusion as to whether the figure is part of the background or whether it has been superimposed on the background?
Mr. WHITE. This is what led to my conclusion that the figures have been superimposed over the background. In other words, if it is impossible for a person to stand in that position in that background, then the figure had to be photographed independently and then pasted, if you will, or superimposed photomechanically on a blank backyard photograph.
Mr. GENZMAN. Thank you, Mr. White. Would you return to your seat.
Mr. White, based on all of your findings, is it your conclusion that the backyard photographs are fakes?
Mr. WHITE. Yes.
Mr. GENZMAN. Based on your expertise, how do you think these photographs came into being?
Mr. WHITE. Well, the way I visualize is very similar to someone coming to our advertising agency with a job they want done. I think that possibly somebody came to a sophisticated art and graphics department of some sort and they had several ingredients with them that they wanted made into a composite photo. They had with them a backyard photo with no person in it. They had a single ID-type photograph of the person we know as Lee Harvey Oswald. They had a couple of Communist newspapers. They had a pistol and they had a rifle. And just suppose that I am this art department that they have come to, I can visualize someone saying to me "Here are these articles. I want them put together into a composite photograph. The person's face you have here, I want him to be holding the guns and the newspapers and then I want the figure superimposed on this background." Well, being in graphics, I recognize that there are several techniques to do this, but it is not a simple matter. In order for our firm to do this, we would go to outside experts probably. We would go to an art studio or some firm which specializes in photographic composites. This is not something that could be done by someone with just a few weeks or a few months training. It would require the skill of a highly technical expert artist and photomechanical technician. And the steps that would be undertaken I visualize as being this. You have the blank backyard photograph, but you need to have a figure to put in it. So either in a studio or in an appropriate lighting in an outdoor situation, you photograph someone holding the gun and the newspapers in various poses. Of course, this person in my opinion was not Lee Harvey Oswald but some photographer's model. Once these photographs, which were taken against a blank or white background, were completed, then an artist superimposed copies of the face on the various bodies in the place of the face of the real person who was photographed holding these objects. At that point some retouching was done. A mask was made which--by "mask" I mean an amberlith outline of the figure and the gun that is to be superimposed on the background. Then through a sophisticated technique called matting, a negative and a positive were made of this mask, and one of these was used to outline the figure; the other was used to knock out of the background--the area to be double printed with the figure holding the gun. Then through the use of this pin register system to make sure the two images match exactly, the figure was printed onto the background. All this was done in a large size, I would estimate 16 by 20 inches. If we were doing the job, we would work with a 16 by 20 probably, even though the final results were going to be rather small. Once this double-printing of the image into the background occurs, then final retouching has to occur, and I think this is where the shadows were added. The ground shadows, in my estimation from having examined them closely, are airbrushed onto the background with transparent watercolor over the existing grass. By the way, at the time that these pictures were made, there is no grass on the ground in Dallas, and there are no leaves on the trees. The date of these pictures supposedly is March 29. I live in Texas, and I see the trees come out. It is usually late April before you have this amount of foliage on the grass, the bushes, and the trees. So I think the shadows were added by transparent retouch- ing, just as the British photo expert said on the film we saw a while ago. Some of the shadows were added improperly. For instance, the shadow of the post by the head of the figure on B is much wider than the same shadow on A. And also as he pointed out, when they cut their airbrush frisket, the knife must have slipped because the post becomes crooked in B and it is not crooked in A.
Mr. GENZMAN. Thank you, Mr. White.
Mr. Chairman, this concludes my questioning. Chairman STOKES. The Chair recognizes Mr. Goldsmith.
Mr. GOLDSMITH. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
Mr. White, when did you first form the opinion that the Oswald backyard pictures are fake? `` Mr. WHITE. You mean an exact date?
Mr. GOLDSMITH. No, roughly.
Mr. WHITE. I would say about 5 years ago.
Mr. GOLDSMITH. And that was after how many years of study of these photographs?
Mr. WHITE. Well, I have been studying them and looking at them, say, for 15 years. I did not start these tests and prepare the artwork you see here until anywhere from 3 to 5 years ago.
Mr. GOLDSMITH. You have been looking at these photographs for approximately 15 years and approximately 5 years ago you reached the conclusion?
Mr. WHITE. About 5 years ago, I ordered copies of the prints from the National Archives in order to make a more detailed study. Previous to that, I had only seen work that other researchers had done, such as Fred Newcomb and some others.
Mr. GOLDSMITH. Examining the photographs, how many factors suggesting that they are fake were you able to find, again just estimating?
Mr. WHITE. I haven't made a count, but I would say 10 to 12 at least.
Mr. GOLDSMITH. Now you indicate that you found at least 10 to 12 factors.
Mr. WHITE. I would guess at that.
Mr. GOLDSMITH. In light of that, do you regard the fakery that has allegedly been done here to be sophisticated or crude?
Mr. WHITE. It is sophisticated.
Mr. GOLDSMITH. Have you ever examined the original exhibits? By that I mean the original first generation of prints of 133-A and B and the original negative?
Mr. WHITE. No. I have only seen the DeMohrenschildt picture in the original.
Mr. GOLDSMITH. So as to exhibits 133-A and B you have never examined the first-generation print and you have never examined the original negative; is that correct?
Mr. WHITE. That is true. I have only the prints that were furnished me by the National Archives.
Mr. GOLDSMITH. Do you know what generation prints they were? By that I mean if someone were to take a picture of 133-A or B, that would now be a second-generation print?
Mr. WHITE. That is right.
Mr. GOLDSMITH. And if someone were to take a picture of that, it would be a third-generation print and so on?
Mr. WHITE. True.
Mr. GOLDSMITH. The materials you were given, do you know what generation they were?
Mr. WHITE. I have no way of knowing. I would presume that they were the next generation after what the exhibit is in the National Archives. That is just a presumption. I have no way of knowing.
Mr. GOLDSMITH. And prior to that, when you indicated that you had thought that these photographs were fake, this was based upon the work done by other people; is that correct?
Mr. WHITE. Yes, on things I had seen in various books, magazines, and so forth.
Mr. GOLDSMITH. And these things that you had seen in various magazines and books, were they the first-generation prints?
Mr. WHITE. I have no idea.
Mr. GOLDSMITH. You must have an idea, because if they were in a magazine or in a book, could it possibly have been a first-generation print?
Mr. WHITE. Oh, no; obviously not.
Mr. GOLDSMITH. Have you ever had occasion to take the original negative from 133-B and analyze it with a computer by a technique called "digital image processing"?
Mr. WHITE. No, obviously not.
Mr. GOLDSMITH. Mr. White, I have in front of me a pamphlet that you put together for the committee.
Mr. WHITE. Yes.
Mr. GOLDSMITH. Do you recognize this?
Mr. WHITE. Yes.
Mr. GOLDSMITH. On page 31 of that pamphlet, I regret that we do not have this in exhibit form. I see that you have it in front of you.
Mr. WHITE. Page what?
Mr. GOLDSMITH. Thirty-one.
Mr. WHITE. Oh, yes.
Mr. GOLDSMITH. I see that you have taken a ruler and placed it by Oswald's body and also by his rifle; is that correct?
Mr. WHITE. Yes.
Mr. GOLDSMITH. Mr. White, do you believe that an object photographed can be measured simply by placing a ruler against the image in the photograph?
Mr. WHITE. No.
Mr. GOLDSMITH. When you measured the object in this photograph, what did you do beyond using the ruler?
Mr. WHITE. This is strictly a two-dimensional measurement. Obviously I did not take into consideration any perspective which might exist or any other considerations. It is just a mere measurement of the body from the weightbearing foot to the top of the head in each case and of the rifle from the muzzle to the butt.
Mr. GOLDSMITH. Without giving any account to other factors?
Mr. WHITE. That is true. I am not a physicist or any sort of a scientist who could determine anything relating to the perspective. We don't know how close the rifle is to his body. We don't know how close the camera is to the subject, so it would be virtually impossible for just a plain citizen like me to interpret the perspective of this photograph.
Mr. GOLDSMITH. Have you had any training in analytical photogrammetry?
Mr. WHITE. No.
Mr. GOLDSMITH. Have you had any formal training in forensic photography?
Mr. WHITE. No.
Mr. GOLDSMITH. Have you had any formal training in the study of shadows in photographs?
Mr. WHITE. No.
Mr. GOLDSMITH. Mr. White, if the picture is authentic, would you expect all the shadows cast by objects in that picture to line up parallel to each other?
Mr. WHITE. I am no expert on that. 1 wouldn't have any conclusion unless you pointed some specific reference to me.
Mr. GOLDSMITH. Are you familiar with the concept known as "vanishing point"?
Mr. WHITE. Oh, yes.
Mr. GOLDSMITH. When you studied these photographs did you use the vanishing point concept to analyze the shadows?
Mr. WHITE. Not as such. I didn't see any point in using a vanishing point to analyze shadows.
Mr. GOLDSMITH. Mr. White, drawing your attention to the right side of photographs 133-A and B, did you detect any retouching there?
Mr. WHITE. I didn't really pay much attention to the marginal edges. I was mostly concerned with things in the center of the picture.
Mr. GOLDSMITH. At this point I would ask that Mr. White be given the original of 133-A and B. Do you have those before you now, Mr. White?
Mr. WHITE. Yes.
Mr. GOLDSMITH. I would like to refer your attention now to the area to Oswald's left in the two photographs.
Mr. WHITE. Yes.
Mr. GOLDSMITH. If you look at the area that I am pointing to at the exhibits, I would ask you to examine that same area in the original photographs.
Mr. WHITE. Yes, I see what you are referring to.
Mr. GOLDSMITH. Are those shadows the same in each background?
Mr. WHITE. It appears to be some sort of imperfection. I can't tell whether it is a shadow or not. They don't appear to be the same though.
Mr. GOLDSMITH. I would now like to draw your attention to a rectangle that appears in the picket fence in each photograph, and if you look at the chart, I will point it out to you, here, and right over here.
Mr. WHITE. OK.
Mr. GOLDSMITH. Did you ever measure that rectangle in those two photographs to see if the measurements were the same?
Mr. WHITE. No.
Mr. GOLDSMITH. When you examined the backyard photographs and used the transparency overlay technique, in addition to that, did you ever actually conduct any measurements?
Mr. WHITE. Of what?
Mr. GOLDSMITH. Of different parts in the background to see if the measurements of those parts correspond to each other?
Mr. WHITE. No. However, I can say that I examined the parts of the photograph in relation to each other, and I recognized that in the darkroom technique employed to make these photographs appear to be shot at different perspectives, that certain darkroom techniques like easel-tilt were used which changed the measurements.
Mr. GOLDSMITH. Now I understand that you have examined them, but again you haven't measured them?
Mr. WHITE. That is true, I have not measured them, but there are measurable differences, I would agree. However, this is not necessarily---
Mr. GOLDSMITH. Mr. White, I would ask you simply to confine your answer to my question, so please wait until my next question, sir. Now you made reference in your testimony earlier to two white portions that appear on the left side of each photograph. I am going to point them out to you now. I believe this is one; is that correct?
Mr. WHITE. Yes. No, it is higher than that, right up there, right there, yes.
Mr. GOLDSMITH. And up here?
Mr. WHITE. Yes.
Mr. GOLDSMITH. Did you ever measure those parts of the photograph to see if they were consistent with each other or if there were measurable differences?
Mr. WHITE. You mean with a ruler?
Mr. GOLDSMITH. With a ruler or any other technique?
Mr. WHITE. Well, I measured them with an overlay technique in which they appeared to be the same.
Mr. GOLDSMITH. Did you measure them by any unit?
Mr. WHITE. NO, not with a ruler or any unit of measurement.
Mr. GOLDSMITH. Mr. White, you have made reference to several points in these photographs that suggest that Oswald's head is disproportionately---- I withdraw the question. That the body of Oswald is not consistent in the various photo-graphs in light of the head size; is that correct?
Mr. WHITE. Yes.
Mr. GOLDSMITH. To what extent, if any, did you compute photogrammetrically the effect of an object's tilt on its apparent length in the photograph?
Mr. WHITE. As I said, I am not a scientist. I don't indulge in that sort of thing.
Mr. GOLDSMITH. Mr. White, I realize you are not a scientist. Do you now whether scientists consider the use of transparency overlays to be a good way of detecting differences between soft edged images?
Mr. WHITE. I have no way of knowing that.
Mr. GOLDSMITH. Thank you very much. I have no further questions, Mr. White.
Chairman STOKES. The Chair recognizes Mr. Genzman.
Mr. GENZMAN. Mr. White, have you analyzed any rifle photo-graphs connected with the Kennedy assassination?
Mr. WHITE. Yes.
Mr. GENZMAN. What caused you to do this analysis?
Mr. WHITE. I was led to this through my study of CE-133-A and B. Once I had determined to my satisfaction that these were fabricated photographs, I wanted to see if I could identify the rifle in the photographs as being the rifle in any other photographs in any of the Warren Commission literature.
Mr. GENZMAN. At this time would you please refer to JFK exhibits marked F-208 and F-396?
Mr. Chairman, JFK exhibit F-208 was previously introduced into the record. I would ask at this time that JFK exhibit F-396 be introduced into the record.
Chairman STOKES. Without objection, it may be entered into the record at this point. [The information follows:]
JFK EXHIBIT F-396
Mr. GENZMAN. Mr. White, could you go over to the exhibits--
Mr. WHITE. Yes, sir.
Mr. GENZMAN [continuing]. Specifically, JFK exhibit F-208, and explain it.
Mr. WHITE. JFK exhibit F-208 is my very earliest attempt to analyze the rifle in CE-133-A and compare it to other photographs of the rifle.
Mr. GENZMAN. Would you identify the various rifles displayed?
Mr. WHITE. Yes. They are labeled "a" through "g" over on the right-hand side. Photograph "a" is a print from exhibit CE-133-A; photograph "b" is exhibit 139 in the Warren Commission report, which the report tells us is the assassination weapon; "c" is another Mannlicher-Carcano rifle that I wanted to compare with all of these; "d" is erroneously labeled "Oswald's Rifle (Bolt Is Open);" this photograph I took out of the book "Six Seconds in Dallas." I learned later, much later than this exhibit was prepared, that this is not Oswald's rifle, according to the 26 volumes. This is called "Replica of Oswald's Rifle," so therefore this labeling is erroneous. Nevertheless it makes a good comparison with the other rifles because it is another Mannlicher-Carcano. Photograph "e"--this is Lieutenant Day's hand here, as he walks out on to Elm Street from the school book depository carrying the rifle. Now, this photograph has been reversed photographically by flopping the negative when it was printed just so it would be in the right orientation with the other photographs. You are actually seeing the opposite side of the gun. Photograph "f'--again this is Lieutenant Day's hand holding the rifle up, on the third floor of the jail the night of the assassination so that the newspaper people could photograph it. Photograph "g" is from Dallas Police Chief Curry's book, and this is the Dallas police file photo of the gun said to be the assassination weapon.
Mr. GENZMAN. Did you line these photographs up end to end?
Mr. WHITE. Yes. The Warren Commission told us that the assassination weapon was 40.2 inches long. In fact there is a tape measure in the picture there. So based on this, I assumed, perhaps erroneously, that all Mannlicher-Carcanos are 40.2 inches long. So in the darkroom, as I printed each of these negatives, I printed them each to an identical length from muzzle to butt.
Mr. GENZMAN. What did you determine from this study?
Mr. WHITE. Well, I determined very little actually. The first thing that I determined, that has not later been proved wrong, is that the gun in photograph 133-A seems identical in every respect to the gun "g" which is the Dallas police file photo. Other than that, I found that most of the reference points through which I extended vertical lines could not be made to line up. So I was really rather baffled by this because I couldn't understand why the various reference points shouldn't line up.
Mr. GENZMAN. Besides your determination that the backyard rifle matched the Dallas police rifle, would you characterize your results as inconclusive?
Mr. WHITE. Yes.
Mr. GENZMAN. Mr. White, what was your next analytical step?
Mr. WHITE. About a year passed between this study and my next one, because I was rather baffled by all this, and I really didn't know where to go from there, until a point in time when a researcher from California named Fred Newcomb furnished me a photograph of the rifle as it existed in the National Archives.
Mr. GENZMAN. Would you briefly describe the exhibit labeled F-396?
Mr. WHITE. OK. Once I received this photo of the Archive rifle and studied it in connection with some of the others, I had what you might call a brainstorm, after hearing some rifle experts talk. When I appeared before Senator Schweiker and the Church committee, I talked to some rifle experts. They said frequently when somebody buys an old war surplus weapon like this, the first thing he does is modify the stock to fit his physique. Therefore the thought dawned on me that the wooden stock is changeable.
Mr. GENZMAN. Did you line up the metal parts?
Mr. WHITE. Yes. I made prints where the metal parts of the rifle, that is, from the muzzle to the trigger guard, were all identical lengths.
Mr. GENZMAN. After lining up the metal parts, what did you determine about these stocks?
Mr. WHITE. I determined that the butts were different lengths after lining up the metal parts.
Mr. GENZMAN. Does the photograph at the bottom demonstrate this discrepancy in the length of the stocks?
Mr. WHITE. Yes. Here we have the Archive rifle printed in brown, the Warren report rifle printed in red; all the way from the muzzle through all the metal parts, in fact all the way to the comb, which is this little notch in the stock of rifle. All of that matches exactly. Only from here back, less than one-fifth length of the rifle, does not match.
Mr. GENZMAN. Briefly what did you determine from your study?
Mr. WHITE. It is my opinion that we have been shown by the authorities more than one gun as being the assassination weapon.
Mr. GENZMAN. Thank you, Mr. White. Mr. Chairman, I have no further questions.
Chairman STOKES. Mr. Goldsmith?
Mr. GOLDSMITH. Mr. White, I just have one question.
Mr. WHITE. All right.
Mr. GOLDSMITH. When you did this study, did you compute photogrammetrically the effect of tilt on the way that the length of an object appears in a photograph?
Mr. WHITE. I conducted a study by photographing a yardstick from three different-
Mr. GOLDSMITH. Mr. White, answer my question. Did you compute photogrammetrically----
Mr. WHITE. What is "photogrammetrically"? Describe to me what "photogrammetrically" is.
Mr. GOLDSMITH. I just have one more question Mr. White. Do you know what photogrammetry is?
Mr. WHITE. No.
Mr. GOLDSMITH. I have no further questions. Thank you. Chairman STOKES. The committee will recess until 1:30 p.m. this afternoon.
Mr. FITHIAN. Mr. Chairman.
Chairman STOKES. Yes, proceed.
Mr. FITHIAN. Will Mr. White be back after the recess?
Chairman STOKES. He will be back.
Mr. FITHIAN. Thank you. [Whereupon, at 12:30 p.m., the select committee was recessed, to reconvene at 1:30 p.m.]
AFTERNOON SESSION
Mr. FITHIAN. The committee will come to order. I will ask Mr. White to take the stand. While he is doing that, let me explain where we are before the House now. Apparently, in about 12 minutes or so the resolution for the funding of this committee will be considered. During that time, of course, the members of the committee will need to be on the floor and there will be a recess. It is not anticipated that that will be a long debate. Then, I believe, Mr. Blakey, we will reconvene and proceed.
Mr. Goldsmith, I believe, has just a couple of more questions. ! had two very brief ones, and so, a matter of 4 or 5 minutes, Mr. White.
Mr. GOLDSMITH. Mr. White, actually I have no further questions to ask you. I would simply like to make a few comments and they are as follows: The committee is very much aware of the assistance that you have offered to us. We are aware of the work that you have performed in this field and the committee is thankful for the work of people such as yourself who have served greatly to assist us in identifying the issues in the area of the photographic evidence that need to be resolved. I might add that at least I am aware that at some time you served as a consultant to this committee, and although you are not at this time affiliated with the committee's photographic evidence panel, that your work has been made available to that panel for analysis. In that regard I would simply state, were it not for people such as yourself, this committee would probably not be here today examining the scientific issues. Again, sir, I would like to thank you very much.
TESTIMONY OF JACK D. WHITE--Resumed
Mr. WHITE. Thank you. I appreciate the opportunity to present this as a private citizen who has no large budget to work with. I am just an ordinary person who has observed lots of things and I am really here to present questions rather than answers.
Mr. GOLDSMITH. We appreciate that. Again, thank you.
Mr. FITHIAN. Mr. White, you are in a professional advertising business, right?
Mr. WHITE. Yes, sir.
Mr. FITHIAN. My contacts with that business have been usually geared to certain times of the even-numbered years, but I believe it correct to say that people doing outdoor advertising and doing brochure layouts, et cetera, would turn us down cold in their own professional work if we sent them second, third, or fourth generation material and they would insist on first generation material; isn't that correct?
Mr. WHITE. Yes. You would be better off using originals. In my tests, as I told the committee, I had no large budget to work with. In all my studies I made use of materials that were available to me.
Mr. FITHIAN. But in your professional work you would always push for first generation?
Mr. WHITE. Yes, I recommended to the committee that they secure originals, the closest generation original to all of these things to study.
Mr. FITHIAN. You have anticipated my second question, then, which was just again to clarify the record. I was sure, being the professional that you are, that you would not have sought or asked for third generation films.
Mr. WHITE. Definitely not.
Mr. FITHIAN. Did the National Archives ever tell you which generation you received?
Mr. WHITE. I didn't ask. I asked for the best copy I could get of CE-133-A and CE-133-B.
Mr. FITHIAN. In your experience in commercial art, I take it it would make a difference certainly along the edge lines and the soft edges as I think the term is used, it would make a difference which generation of print was used and how sharp the clarity of the things were? There is a quality difference, isn't there?
Mr. WHITE. That depends. In some cases there is and in some cases it is negligible. The most noticeable difference of the photocopy from the original is in contrast. You hardly ever in a good photocopy will lose significant detail, but you will increase contrast so that the dark areas are generally darker and the light areas are generally lighter.
Mr. FITHIAN. Mr. Thone, this concludes my questions of the witness. Do you have any questions?
Mr. THONE. No, Mr. Chairman.
Mr. FITHIAN. Mr. White, it is the custom of this committee to permit the witness at the conclusion of his or her testimony an additional 5 minutes to clarify, amplify or modify or comment on any testimony. We would offer you that time now.
Mr. WHITE. I don't have too much to say except to thank the committee. There was one area of questioning which I had hoped to get into, which because of the shortness of time before lunch I was not permitted to go into. That is the question of the DeMohrenschildt picture. The DeMohrenschildt picture shows a much larger amount of background around the edges than any of the photographs, 133-A, B or C. To me this indicates that the DeMohrenschildt picture is printed full negative. In fact, we can verify this because it is printed with a black border around the edge, the black border being the clear area around the edge of the negative. According to the FBI, the picture, CE-133-B, was identified as being taken with Oswald's camera because it could be matched to the film plane aperture. Yet if the DeMohrenschildt picture shows a larger background area and it is taken from the same camera viewpoint, then 133-A, B and C have all been cropped and, therefore, if there is more background area in the picture, then it could not possibly be matched to the film plane aperture. Other than that, I have no additional comments.
Mr. FITHIAN. Thank you, Mr. White. You are excused. We want to thank you for coming today.
Mr. WHITE. Thank you.this is my first instructable, hope you like it. :)

Hi Gail and All,
I teach in a district that is stringently non-denominational about
every major holiday. We don't use the H-word (Halloween) or the C-
word (you can guess what that is) and we still manage to do nice
observances around this time of year. How about celebrating the
winter season and peace on earth? These are themes that are timely
and non-denominational. Winter animal themes are also appropriate;
doves, foxes, rabbits, moose, deer, etc. Try a winter weather
approach and do imagery about snow, crystals, and the need for
bonfires, etc.
A nice, quick, simple, kid-friendly gift to make are bird-feeder pine
cones. Get nice pine cones and drill a small hole in the large end.
Insert an eye hook and a pretty cord to hang them up. Spray a
mixture of diluted gelatin and water (gelatin can be found in the
canning section at the market) and then roll them in bird seed. I
buy 50 lb. bags of bird seed for under $10 at Walmart. We then
package these gifts in cellophane with a ribbon. Everyone really
loves them and they make a nice ecological gift to the birds. By the
way, I saw this idea in the Smith and Hawkins winter catalog last
winter and they cost big bucks!!
For cards and wrapping paper, try printing with oil-based non-
hardening clay and stamp pads. Form the clay into a stamp base,
impress a design into it and then stamp. You can do a central design
for cards or a repeating design for nice wrapping paper. Try gold and
silver ink stamp pads on colored paper. You can get these stamp pads
in specialty crafts stores like Michael's (in California).
Best wishes to all for a lovely winter season and peace on earth!!

>S. Jessop shares her unique experience being a truck driver for an oil rig in this career interview. She shares what it was like having men not want her on their rigs just because she was female, and how she constantly has to work harder than others in her field to prove herself because of her gender. Whether you are male or female, if you’re thinking about a career in truck driving, this interview is for you!
What is your job title and what industry do you work in? How many years of experience do you have in this field? How would you describe yourself using only three adjectives?
I am a truck driver working in the oil field. I have 7 1/2 years of driving tractor trailer. I would describe myself as dedicated, trustworthy, and caring.
What’s your ethnicity and gender? How has it hurt or helped you? If you ever experienced discrimination, how have you responded and what worked best? Do you speak another language, and has it been helpful in your career?
I am female. It seems like I have always had to prove myself since I have worked in mostly a “mans” job occupational field. In the oil field they just didn’t want me there. A lot of the men said flat out that women didn’t belong in the oil field. I did my job better than most, some people at the rigs would tell my dispatcher that they wanted me on their rig, and I was told that I worked circles around most of the men, but that wasn’t enough to get over the prejudice of most of the workers. I am an outgoing person, very friendly to everyone. In hind sight, I should have kept to myself and been invisible I guess. After 4 months of harassment I started keeping to myself, but that didn’t help, so, I lasted 3 more months and then quit.
How would you describe what you do? What does your work entail? Are there any common misunderstandings you want to correct about what you do?
I haul fresh water to rigs when they are getting ready to frac the well. They shoot the water down the well at 8000 psi to break up the rock, shale, etc to get the minerals. I haul off what they call flow back, the fresh water after it has gone down the well. After the well is set, gas, oil and lease water is sent through a separator. The poison H2S is removed from the gas and it is sent down the gas line to sell, the water and oil is then separated and they go to their own tanks, usually 3 tanks for each so nothing overflows. I go in and pull the lease water out and take it to salt water disposals. New wells can produce 200 barrels an hour, our rigs can only hold 130, so it can be very busy. What I would like to change is the misconception that women can’t do this job. Its hard work, but that’s what I love about it.
On a scale of 1 to 10 how would you rate your job satisfaction? What might need to change about your job to unleash your full enthusiasm?
I rate it right now at a 4. The thing that needs to change, is being taken seriously. I have a good head on my shoulders, I can see things that would make our jobs easier but I’m not taken seriously.
If this job moves your heart – how so? Ever feel like you found your calling or sweet spot in life? If not, what might do it for you?
I love driving. It was my sweet spot, but I am at a crossroads in my life. Do what I love and be alone or find a new passion and have a social life. I choose social life. I love to bake, make jewelry, read and photography. Those are the areas that I am looking into now.
Is there anything unique about your situation that readers should know when considering your experiences or accomplishments?
I have been all over the lower 48 and Canada. I wanted off the road so I could have some kind of social life. Since the 7 month struggle I have had here, I’m not sure what to do, all available driving jobs are in the oil field it seems. I have been looking for another career in some of my other interests. I believe that if you love what you do you will never WORK a day in your life. My mother is 90 years old and still does what she loves 30 hours a week. Having mostly trucking and construction in my background, It has been difficult to get in the door to start a new career. I WILL persevere.
How did you get started in this line of work? If you could go back and do it differently, what would you change?
I got started back in 1985. I was 6 months pregnant, and my (then) husband was driving truck. We were going through Nevada and he got very sick and our load had to be in LA. He told me I was going to have to drive, and that out in the desert I couldn’t hurt anything… So, a truck driver was born!
If I could go back, I would have learned other aspects of the transportation industry, it would have opened more career opportunities for when I got older.
What did you learn the hard way in this job and what happened specifically that led up to this lesson?
I just kept doing what I loved and never looked long term. I am now at an age that pulling a flatbed or a tanker is out of the question. I hate pulling reefer or dry van, (to much time setting.)
What is the single most important thing you have learned outside of school about the working world?
To prepare for retirement when you are young enough to have the time to save for it… My boys are 25 and 30 and they both are focused on retirement.
What’s the strangest thing that ever happened to you in this job?
I went to a location where the well was set and the fluids were pumping into the stock tanks. It was about 11pm. When I pulled on to the location I got a strange feeling, (goose bumps) I pulled around to load. I couldn’t get my pump to work, it would start then stop. Nothing would work. I had a very uneasy feeling, kept looking behind me felt like I was being watched. You have to understand, these locations are out in remote areas of northwestern Oklahoma, nothing for miles and miles. I couldn’t get anything done. I called another driver he said that it was on Native American burial land, and there was a little prayer you had to say. I told him to come do it; I wasn’t going to, I thought he was pulling my leg. He came and said the prayer and he got loaded no problems… I never went back there!
Why do you get up and go to work each day? Can you give an example of something that really made you feel good or proud?
I am proud of what I do. I feel I do a great service for Americans. We bring food, clothes, vehicles, building material, fuels to stay warm, etc. Local drivers take grain and hay out of the field… we move America.
What kind of challenges do you face and what makes you just want to quit?
The challenges that I face are inner city traffic like Dallas at 5pm. Staying current with all the DOT regulations and knowing the local and state laws.
The only thing that makes me want to quit is not being able to have a social life, being single and on the road all the time is very hard and lonely.
How stressful is your job? Are you able to maintain a comfortable
or healthy work-life balance? How?
This job can be very stressful, but if you love it you take it in stride because you love what you do. Truck driving is a career that you HAVE to love to do it.
What’s a rough salary range for the position you hold? Are you paid enough and/or happy living within your means?
Oilfield work is great with pay from $3000 to 6000 a month. You work about 70 hrs in 6 days in the oil positions. For local hauling jobs, it pays on average 1200 – 1500 a month. Over the road (OTR) trucking pays 4000-10000 a month, but that depends on whether you work for a company as an employee, or own your own. I grossed 189,000 when I owned my own rig.
How much vacation do you take? Is it enough?
I have never taken a vacation. When I was OTR, I owned my own rig so I would intentionally take jobs that would take me to the towns where my friend and family lived and just take a few days or a week off to spend time with them. A company driver can’t do that and they usually get 2 days off for every 2 or 3 weeks out on the road.
What education and skills do you need to get hired and succeed in this field?
Today you have to go to truck driving school. I would say Schneider National has the best, they teach you to handle the truck in different situations, like hydroplane, ice etc.
What would you tell a friend considering your line of work?
Take a hard look at it. If you are considering OTR, make sure you like being alone a lot unless you run team, them make sure you can live in a 6×6 space with someone else. Any driving job you take you have to be on your A game. Most of the people on the road with you have little or no respect for what you are driving, and it can be dangerous.
If you could write your own ticket, what would you like to be doing in five years?
I would love to go to pastry school and open my own bakery

This makes it difficult to find the parameters that maximize the marginal likelihood.
An elegant solution is to introduce a "variational distribution" q of the parameters and the latent variables
The constant C is here to remind us that q has the constraint of being a distribution, ie. of summing to 1, which can be enforced by a Lagrange multiplier.
The crucial assumption is to assume the independence of the parameters and the latent variables:
We can then use the concavity of the logarithm and Jensen's inequality to optimize a lower bound of the marginal log-likelihood:
Now we have to optimize the right-hand side of the inequality. Let's name it as it is a functional, ie. a function of functions.

The Heilige Seelen-Lust: The Author, Structure, and Facsimile
1.1 The
Heilige Seelen-Lust, a collection of Counter-Reformation spiritual
poems by Johannes Scheffler and their music, provides an important musical
document for the period following the Thirty Years War. This facsimile
edition makes Schefflers work widely available to scholars for
the first time. Johannes Scheffler (1624–77), who adopted the
name Angelus Silesius after his conversion to Catholicism, was one of
the leading mystical poets of the Counter-Reformation in Central Europe.
He was born in Breslau to a Polish nobleman-immigrant to Silesia and
a German woman. Although orphaned at a young age, he received an excellent
education in Breslau and continued his studies at the universities of
Strasbourg, Leiden, and Padua. In 1649 he moved back to Silesia, where
he came into contact with the prominent mystical poets Daniel Czepko
and Abraham von Frankenberg. At this time he developed a strong mystical
inclination, which brought him eventually into conflict with Lutheran
orthodoxy, and finally—as he described it himself—to a break
with Protestantism (8).1
In 1653 he converted to Catholicism and was ordained a priest in 1661.
Although Scheffler wrote 55 vehemently pro-Catholic polemical pamphlets,
his most significant works are two collections of poems, Der cherubinische
Wandersmann and Heilige Seelen-Lust, both of which appeared
in 1657. According to the editors, In Schefflers literary
development these two contemplative, contemporaneous works marked the
lyrical and spiritual high point of his career, never again reached
(9). Der cherubinische Wandersmann is an intellectual tour-de-force
of 1679 poems, mostly rhymed Alexandrine couplets. The Heilige Seelen-Lust,
however, is much more varied in theme and structure. The primary theme
of the collection is the personal relationship between Jesus and the
individual soul; the poems therefore continue the tradition of pastoral
poetry, in which Jesus is cast as the loving shepherd and the soul the
love-struck bride. There are also overtones of religious eroticism and
sublimation. Structurally, the Heilige Seelen-Lust is a tour-de-force
of a different type. According to Jeffrey L. Sammons, From simple
four-line stanzas of rhymed couplets through the larger eight-line stanzas
familiar from the Protestant hymn, to involved forms with internal rhymes
and shifting meters, the collection is nearly an encyclopedia of the
lyrical forms available to German poetry at that time.2
All but one of the 205 Heilige Seelen-Lust poems include music
(the exception is no. 200). 184 of the melodies and their bass lines
are apparently original compositions by the Breslau composer Georg Joseph
(ca. 1620–ca. 1668). The other 20 settings (scattered throughout
the collection) are identified by the phrases Nach eines andren
Melodey or Auff eine bekandte Melodey. Josephs
original compositions are examples of the seventeenth-century solo aria
in the tradition of Heinrich Alberts Arias for Edification.
The editors note that in his History of Catholic Church Music
(1976), Michael Härting concluded that the positive popular response
to these melodies signifies the definitive success of the expressive
declamatory solo song in the Catholic sphere (21).
1.2 The
Heilige Seelen-Lust was first published in 1657 and contained
a total of four books of songs. The second edition, which appeared in
1668, was enlarged with the addition of a fifth book. According to the
editors, the first three books constitute a cohesive whole: the sequence
of the songs is based on the liturgical year, which can be interpreted
as a journey of the soul as bride with its bridegroom, Jesus. The fourth
and fifth books break with this organization, in both title and theme.
The title of the first three books (the title by which the entire collection
is known) is Heilige Seelen-Lust (Holy Joy of the Soul).
The fourth and fifth books are titled Geistlichen Hirten-Lieder
(Spiritual Pastoral Songs). The first songs of the fourth and fifth
books also delineate the change in theme; they praise Mary, Queen of
Heaven, and are based on traditional Latin hymns. Although these two
books contain Christ-related spiritual love songs similar to those in
the first three, sprinkled throughout are enough pointedly Catholic
poems that the reader is constantly reminded to which confession the
author belonged. Despite the obvious Catholic leanings, however, in
the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries many of the poems (though not
the melodies) were used by Protestants, especially those of a Pietistic
orientation. For example, Traute Maass Marshall and Lothar Hoffmann-Erbrecht
in their Grove article on Scheffler point out that the Pietists
in particular embraced his poems; 30 were included in the widely used
Geistreiches Gesangbuch (1704), edited by J.A. Freylinghausen.3
1.3 The
facsimile, taken from the exemplar in the Martinus Bibliothek (Mainz),
is a complete reproduction of the 1668 edition. The editors have also
included a poem from a 1675 publication by Scheffler, which, according
to the author, he was not able to include in the 1668 edition.4
The quality of the facsimile is excellent; the texts and music can be
read easily, and variations in typography are not a distraction.

Introduction to the Facsimile
2.1 In
an extensive introduction the editors provide a comprehensive overview
of the collection. It addresses the traditional areas of inquiry, including
the frontispiece art, biographies of the poet and composer, the creation
and structure of the collection, major themes of the poetry, and a comparison
of these themes with contemporary musical thought, most notably the
Musurgia universalis of Athanasius Kircher. Fischer and Fugger
devote little attention to factual information, such as the biographies
of the poet and composer, but this coverage is adequate for an introduction.
2.2 By
far the greatest part of the introduction is taken up with analysis
and interpretation of the themes and hermeneutic structures found in
the Heilige Seelen-Lust. Fischer and Fugger begin with an examination
of the frontispiece art, an engraving by Johann Baptist Paravicinus.
The foreground of the engraving is dominated by a seated, lute-playing
female figure, a representation of the soul (Psyche) in
love with God. She is surrounded by flowers, grasses, a bird, and a
river, all images found in various poems in the collection. In the background
is an epiphany image, in which shafts of light from the heavens shine
on two cities, apparently Bethlehem and Jerusalem. According to Fischer
and Fugger, the frontispiece art follows Baroque tradition in that it
constitutes an emblematic unity with the associated title of the
work and its following content (5). Following a brief biography
of the poet, the editors examine the title page and preface, which establish
the hermeneutic key to the substance and theological development
of the Heilige Seelen-Lust (10). The primary intent of the collection,
through emphasizing the affective relationship between man (the soul)
and God (Jesus), is clothed in two traditional conceptions: laus
Dei and recreatio cordis, the praise of God and the re-creation
of the heart, which was understood as spiritual entertainment
(11). The two characters of the poetry are directly addressed
in the prefatory material; the collection is dedicated to Jesus Christ,
and the preface addresses the love-sick soul. In the Preface,
Scheffler alludes to typical themes: bucolic love poetry, weddings,
and the vanity of the world. Fischer and Fugger next explain that the
affects which play a special role in the Heilige Seelen-Lust
are the love of God, longing, and holy joy.
2.3 Following
a discussion of the creation and structure of the collection, the editors
briefly turn their attention to the melodies of the songs. This reviewer
wished for a more thorough analysis of the music, although such an examination
would probably take much more space than is practicable.5 A more thorough discussion certainly
would help to clarify the following arguments, however. Fischer and
Fugger expressly state that, although many of the melodies are as simple
as contemporary church song, Josephs compositions were not
conceived for congregational singing. They served, rather, for the edification
of an aesthetically and theologically educated public, which made use
of private performance of music and sufficient financial resources
(21). Immediately following this judgment, they claim that presumably
in order to broaden the possibilities of reception, the Breslau 1668
edition was offered to those who were not proficient in the art of singing
or had no opportunity to learn the melodies (21). Curiously, nothing
is offered to back up either assertion. The next section very briefly
touches on two performance possibilities: private domestic music-making
and public performance with expanded instrumentation. The basis for
these speculations is found in images in individual songs (individuals
playing lutes and corporate musical celebrations by groups). This section,
like the previous one, is loosely written and, perhaps unintentionally,
raises more questions than it provides answers.
2.4 The
final section of the introduction compares the major themes of the Heilige
Seelen-Lust with the ideas found in Athanasius Kirchers Musurgia
universalis of 1650. Kircher, like Scheffler, believed that men
could ascend into a holy love-union with God with the help of the angelic
orders and through the constant use of all the virtues. Kircher also
pictures the soul as a stringed instrument whose strings, he prays,
will be set in motion by God. This parallels Schefflers concept
of the soul as a lute whose highest and purest function is to praise
God. Fischer and Fugger conclude their introduction with a summary worthy
of Scheffler himself: Thus comes into being a multi-voiced harmony
between text and music, spirituality and aesthetics, godliness and ethics
(26).

Evaluation
3.1 This
facsimile reprint makes available to scholars a major source of seventeenth-century
devotional literature in an easily-accessible form. On the whole, the
editorial introduction succeeds in placing the work into an historical
context and whets the scholarly appetite for further investigation.
Just a few small areas were not addressed. For example, Fischer and
Fugger do not discuss the exemplar used for the facsimile. Why was this
particular exemplar chosen? What is its provenance? Where can other
exemplars be found? In addition, the facsimile contains a few handwritten
marginal notations which are neither noted nor discussed by the editors.
These small lacunae, however, do not detract from its value and significance
as a scholarly source.

Provocatively: Who should be allowed to survive?
In a TED-Talk by Juan Enriquez 3 main technological trends are presented that might in the future enable us to improve our perception and other abilities significantly. He is even saying that people with access to such technology would be "Homo Evolutis" and thus a different kind of man. They would be more powerful than "homo sapiens" because of their new abilities.
To avoid such a separation of mankind the access to the technology must be fair and regulated. So: How do we decide who gets access to it? Are socio-economic factors good selection criteria for the new kind of evolution? people with those traits and give them access to the technologies yet.
Just to make it clear: "Survival" is meant metaphorically and used as a synonym for getting access to the technologies that Juan Enriquez presents in his talk. There is no literal meaning or any elitistic aspect to it.
Thus the question reformulated is:
Who do you think should get access to the technologies that Juan Enriquez presents and how can this distribution be realised practically, so that it is fair and humanity is not separated into "evolutis" and "sapiens"?
John Smith
Who do you think should get access to the technologies that Juan Enriquez presents and how can this distribution be realised practically, so that it is fair and humanity is not separated into "evolutis" and "sapiens"?"
Solution: pay for it through public funds so everyone has access, if some technologies are too expensive for this then ban them until they become cheaper, that or have a lottery (but I think most people prefer not to have a lottery).
Yes, this may cause some technologies to be held back but if giving those technologies to the highest bidder early on dos not advance the greater good, why should the world care that those technologies are being held back?
Or to put it bluntly: your great, grea, great grandfather having sunk a Spanish ship for the crown is a piss poor way to decide that you deserve transhuman enhancements and I don't, even if you work twice as hard as me that still shouldn't entitle you to get enhancements that increase your productivity ten fold and it sure as hell shouldn't mean that my descendants will never again have the opportunity to catch up with your descendants, no matter how hard they, standard humanly possible, work.

Those who already have access to universal consciousness are powerful beings. No one can harm them without their consent. They manifest things and situations into their realities. They walk toward different probabilities than most.
To connect to universal consciousness and utilize the power, wisdom, & knowledge thereof, one need only be self-aware. Most people don't even know that there is a self that exists beyond/without ego. These are the ones who are choosing to not-evolve. No one can choose for them.
In the words of James Randi, "They are the sheep (sheeple) who beg to be fleeced and butchered, and who will battle fiercely to preserve their right to be victimized."
Mathias Probst
If we define for this discussion that evolution comes with the new technologies that enhance the human body, self cannot always decide whether to evolve or not because some people (even if self aware) might not have access to this technology.
If evolution is connected to "universal consciousness" this is a whole new topic. I would by the way be interested what exactly you understand by the term "universal consciousness". For you, is it a mental state or higher power or what do you think it is?
PS: I do not like your quotation.. Even though it is probably meant differently it seems like a justification for dictatorship and discrimination to me.
Gail .
For me, universal conscious is a state of being self-aware. Most people are owned by their emotions, and they are thus blocked from self-awareness. They tend to confuse emotional reaction with intellectual thought. This causes a state of perceptual blindness.
I know that the quote is harsh. It isn't a call for a dictatorship. It's an explanation of how dictatorships come into being. Those who are self-aware do not play "follow the leader". They own their emotional states rather than be owned by them. They have walked through their irrational fears. They know that emotions come AFTER thought, that they are two completely different things, and that emotions are a compass (tool) rather than a weapon of self-flagelation.
So in answer to the lead question, "Who should be allowed to survive?", I answered that those who are self-aware will choose to and those who are not self-aware will play "follow the leader" to their own ends.
I say this because humanity is in the midst of a perfect storm. Our numbers have exceeded our ability to sustain us. Global warming - whatever the cause - is diminishing that state further. Our fiscal paradigm rewards farming conglomerates to pollute aquifers and destroy top soil - degrading it further. Our fiscal paradigm also rewards those who profit from instigating wars including manipulating the sheeple who will encourage them (in the name of self-defense that isn't really self-defense).
Whether by plague or war or just plain famine and thirst, our number will be diminished. Those who are self-aware have learned how to manifest things/situations into their realities. These are the ones with the tools to survive. Thus the choice of who will survive is ours alone - not someone else's.
Mathias Probst
I did not mean "Who should be allowed to survive" literally but I used "survive" as a provocative metaphor for being granted access to the technologies that Enriquez presents (I derived the metaphor from his declaring the technology as evolution in combination with Darwin's principle of evolution). Through this understanding of the term "survival" it might be someone elses choice whether for a self-conscious being to get access to evolution in Enriquez' sence or not.
So, applying this to your proposal: Do you think that self-awareness should be the main criterion of how to select those who should be able to enhance their bodies artificially? And if yes what would be a good mechanism to objectively find them? Maybe a system of self-selection could be imaginable here.
Gail .
But if someone can, given that our economy is on the brink of collapse, money won't be the determining factor on "who".

What exactly is the decision here?
When new technology comes out the richest and the show-offs purchase it first for the sake of the novelty and then as the price drops, everyone else purchases it. Even in a medical related areas I'm not aware of a situation that greatly deviates from that model.
"In fact: How should Darwin's "survival of the fittest" be redefined"
Its actually been redefined since the birth of society if you really think about it. Humans have been almost entirely independent of the environmental factors that made 'survival of the fittest' a requirement since that point.
'how could it then be realised?"
...How could what be realized? I assume the answer isn't as obvious as 'it becomes realized when you put the definition in the dictonary', so you need to elaborate. Thanks

If you sincerely believe that government regulation can provide a better means of rationing technology, you must have very little experience with government regulation.
'I think "survival of the moral and intelligent" would be an ideal principle.'
This is exactly the kind of good intentions that lead to horrors. Please read about the history of Eugenics. It is clear that you are not proposing Eugenics, but the similarities are alarming. Many of the people who first advocated Eugenics had very good intentions, they sincerely wanted to reduce human misery. And by the way, this statement is the very essence of elitist.
Also, you might want to read about organ donor lists.
Mathias Probst
So to come back to the question: You think that the use of such technology should be as free as possible and regulated by the market, right? In a way some sort of "survival of the rich"? Socio-economis factors might be a way to find "good" people because we tend to financially reward characteristics like intelligence, but doesn't it lack a moralistic aspect for you?
Of course the ideal principle is "survival of everyone" but I think that there will be a long transition phase where someone might be forced to select who gets the technology first.
Barry Palmer
This is the real world. "Should" is and will continue to be irrelevant.
I think every human being should have access to clean drinking water, plentiful nutritious food, quality shelter and the very best health care. I think humans should treat each other kindly and never hurt each other. That is my fantasy. It guides some of my actions and some of my words, but it is very important to remember that the real world does not conform to my wishes.
In the modern real world, regulating access to technology, and especially the type of technology that Juan Enriquez is talking about, is impossible. That is probably a good thing, because no human, and no group of humans, is wise enough to decide who gets this technology and who does not get it. History has taught us that people who consider themselves wise enough to make such decisions have made horrible decisions.
Your notion that there might exist some group of "good" people who "should" have access to advanced technology is offensive, regardless of your definition of "good" and regardless of any particular set of criteria. It necessarily implies that other people are inferior and not deserving.
If the government "should" have any role in this issue, that role should be to assure that everyone has an equal OPPORTUNITY to live as they choose to live. Some people choose to pursue the wealth that would assure them early access to these technologies. Other people choose to pursue other values. Many people will not be capable of using such technology.
By the way, if you do read about organ donor lists, be sure to also read about the "black" market for human organs.
Mathias Probst
So, discussion about possible fairer ways of distribution out there - whatever they may be - makes sense to me. If we cannot find fairer ways (I think it would be fairer to include moral factors for example) that's fine, but I want to at least try challenging this system of distribution for some goods that would give you power over others. That is because I am not convinced that wealthy people are the best ones to deal with this power. (Again here: I think it's bad if some people have more power than others but if we cannot prevent it, then who should have the power? I am not trying to make elitist statements, I am coming from the premise that we may be unable to prevent this difference from occuring)
Maybe there is another possibility to the free market, where people really have equal chances to get access if they like and where moral behaviour is rewarded more than in our current economy.
PS: You did not say should but that does not mean it is irrelevant. "Should" might be irrelevant from a positive point of view, but if we want to change something, to be aware of the "should" is the first step and I am trying to discuss it in this threat.
The second step is how to realise the "should" and you appropriately described one major problem: How can the distribution be decided (you proposed the free marked which is a system created by humans as well with the consequence being the rich getting access, I believe there must be a better solution)
How the realisation could be achieved instead should thus be a question to concentrate our capacities on.
pat gilbert
Or how about it is not anyone's place to decide such things?
Mathias Probst
I am not sure if you understood what this conversation really is about. Eugenics is not proposed in any way here, Juan Enriquez says that genetical engineering could be one aspect of the next step of evolution. And that you assume that a German should be especially interested in Eugenics disturbs me a bit.
Anyways, I think genetical engineering will sooner or later be a reality we have to cope with and one of the questions asked in this conversation is how to regulate access to it and use it responsively.
"Or how about it is not anyone's place to decide such things?"
I assume this is your answer to the question "Who should be allowed to survive?" and by taking this question litterally you assumed that I was talking about implementing some crazy nazi ideology :D. If you follow the comments more carefully, you will see that the conversation has nothing to do with that.
It has a provoking title, but the word "survive" derives from Enriquez calling the three technological trends "evolution" in combination with Darwin's evolutionary principle as I wrote in another comment.
The main question asked here is who should get access to those powerful technologies and I do think that it is democracy's place to decide that. Better decide democratically and consciously than letting fate decide for us! This question is too important to just risk a separation of humanity.
pat gilbert
Hitler thought it best who should live or not as well.
You are say you are disturbed a bit, that is a two way street!

As long as you do not reply to what I commented and base your opinion on an argument I cannot understand your point. What do you actually think this discussion is about, because never did I say anyone would know best who should live. I already explained this to you and also how the term "survive" in the lead question was meant but you seem to ignore that reply..
Bringing Hitler into the discussion without reffering to anything relevant to the topic seems a bit inappropriate to me as well.
Please help me understand how you come from discussing the access to technology to Hitler and deciding who should live! In your two comments you did not contribute to the topic of the discussion yet and you should make sure you read what I wrote first before drawing comparisons of my alleged opinion that could not be more wrong.
I am intrigued to hear your argument on why the access to genetical engineering and other powerful and potentially dangerous science should not be restricted or at least regulated by the government.
Thank you

I understand what you mean but if you don't argue this is not really constructive. I've spent enough time trying to explain to you that I am not a fascist and still do not understand how you came to this assumption but I hope you understand my question now. I hope your view of the world outside of America will become a bit more elaborate in the near future.
All the best and thanks for your contribution.

Maybe I did not make my question clear enough in the header.
What I would be interested in is not who gets access but who should get access to the technology.
I think that it will be very hard to make the innovations accessible to everyone and if we do not try to establish systems and rules for the access it will indeed result in the richest purchasing it first and maybe only them. But I do not think this is a good solution. The advantage that they would have over the rest of the people might create a separation between two races of men: The "homo sapiens" and the "homo evolutis". The advantages of the technology would in a way make some men superior to others and give them more power which I do not like but it might be inevitable.
My question is how we should select for the sake of humanity to whom we want to give this power and how we can establish a system of distribution that realises the access of the selected crowd.
The term "survival of the fittest" has indeed redefined itself since the rise of civilisation, but why not try a normative approach? those people give them access to the "further evolution" yet.
In your comment you appropriately describe the current situation and I hope the question is more clear now and we can start thinking out of the box :)

Targets are all harder to reach, but you have excellent courage to reach it. There is no meaning of try to reach the target, no failure, only success, the key for success is hard work, concentration, responsibility. Think twice before you are going to do wrong, think on your parents, their reputation in society. Don't spoil your parents dreams. Before praying God, pray your parents. Parents are living God's.

Good.Chapter One...A Decade
Released:."“.” Her journal was a beautifully-written account of her marriage to a wealthy man from another country (the location was never clear—she described beaches, a gleaming, blue-green pool, servants, and a personal tutor with an “angry haircut”). She claimed to be a seventeen-year-old American girl who had been swept away from a boring suburban life and plunged into a life of cocktails at noon, constant sunshine, and parties for which she was carefully dressed by maids and trotted around to impress fellow rich men and dignitaries. She described the manicured lawn, the servants, and her husband, who was often gone on “business,” a state of affairs she didn’t seem to mind, though when he returned, he showered her with love and presents, which she enjoyed. This obscure Livejournal account, and the languid, passive, and beauty-obsessed writer, was the first thing I thought of when I first heard Lana Del Rey.
Del Rey’s music is a melding of somber crooning and propulsive beats, ironic posturing and genuine sadness, of girlishness and Thanatos. Her music and persona, as presented in songs like “Born to Die” and “Ride,” are bewildering and retro. In nearly all of her music videos, she is somehow being restrained or forced by male characters—in “Blue Jeans,” a male character puts his fingers down her throat; in “Born to Die,” she is forcefully kissed, her mouth smashed against his mouth; and in“Ride” she is bent over a pinball machine.
Her characters welcome this, though. In almost every song, the speaker is begging to be viewed voyeuristically:
I’m in his favorite sun dress/Watching me get undressed
Watch me in the swimming pool bright blue ripples you/Sitting sipping on your black Cristal
Likes to watch me in the glass room bathroom, Chateau Marmont/Slippin’ on my red dress, puttin’ on my makeup
Every Saturday night I get dressed up to ride for you, baby.
Every lyric is about performing for someone. Her characters seem to have no inner world aside from a desire to be driven somewhere, anywhere, fast, “fucked hard,” and, well, to die. And this is where Lana Del Rey gets weird.
Here, she reminds me of another doomed female heroine, Laura Palmer from Twin Peaks. Like Palmer,
Del Rey’s characters continually flirt with disaster and death. Her songs both acknowledge and welcome the dangers of chasing away a deadening sadness by taking too many drugs, driving too fast, and burning out while still glamorous. The videos, too, depict this. In “Born to Die,” Del Rey’s character seems to be singing from a big, empty heaven, as we see her climb into a car and end up bloodied and dead, held in the arms of her heavily-tattooed boyfriend.
This courting of death makes her unique among the current female singers with a masochistic streak: while Rihanna makes videos about the effects of living fast and free (as in“We Found Love”), the idea is that you can have fun—but must pay for it later. Lana Del Rey’s music makes paying for it the point.
So, what’s appealing to a woman about this persona of a death-seeking sex doll who begs men to see her as an object? I think it comes from the fact that we’re not supposed to want the things that Del Rey’s
characters want. They are everything a modern woman doesn’t allow herself to be. And so it lingers, a shadow femininity, one that women are both attracted to and repelled by. To be frank, it is sometimes exciting to be completely dominated by another person and, sometimes, to be an object, admired as one might admire a painting. It is also damaging, obviously, to not be seen as fully human. Still, objects have power. When the character in the song “Off to the Races” says Tell me you own me, she also says, Who else would put up with me this way?” In a relationship where she is objectified, she is also free. There will be no pesky interventions and no limits on what she is allowed to do, as there would be in a mutual relationship. She is free to kill herself from drinking or overdosing, still free as long as she has youth (something else with which Del Rey’s music is obsessed). It makes sense, then, that these characters would also court death—what will they have after their beauty, youth, and desirability fade?
Del Rey’s music, persona, and videos all play to this shadow side, but do it cannily, in a way that demonstrates self-awareness. Her songs reference Walt Whitman and Nabokov as well as hip-hop, classic films, and doomed icons such as Marilyn Monroe and Elvis. This mix of both high and low culture doesn’t mean that she always gets it exactly right—songs like “Gods and Monsters” and “Cola” are too on-the-nose and outright goofy to be effective—but the consistency of her obsessions suggests that she isn’t blind to the impact of her choices.
But back to that Livejournal account. I’ve asked many people whom I knew from those early LJ days if they remember this account, and none of them do. I wonder, sometimes, if I made it up myself, if it was some kind of shadow side of my own life at the time. Even at eighteen, in 1999, I was living an adult,
responsible life, attending a Southern Baptist college full-time and working thirty hours a week. I neither drank nor smoked, and lived miles and miles away from beaches. Maybe I needed a Lolita from somewhere far off, a girl full of cocktails, sunshine, and seashores, and created her all on my own. Lana Del Rey, too, feels like a culturally-created specter, her presence more an exorcism than a rehashing of old stereotypes. She is the poster child for dark, death-obsessed, objectified femininity, and her persona feels dangerous because it is—representative of the edge that contemporary women are often flirting with and pushing against and, sometimes, going over.

The purpose of this project was to create an attractive, durable floor display that would grab the attention of shoppers at a major auto retailer. The display would be strategically placed in the tire section of the store to entice tire customers to also purchase the Black Magic tire care products.
After sketching out a few ideas, our initial design concepts were refined using advanced modeling software and then presented to the client. Once they decided on a design, we engineered and produced 1,000 displays in our 60,000-square-foot-facility. One of the unique design features of this display included a vacuum-formed header and base made to look like a tire. Wire tubing and sheet metal were used to form the inner structure. In addition, the display was designed to be viewable from all sides.
Once all the displays were produced, they were warehoused at our facility and then distributed to various store locations. All together, the project was completed over 10 weeks: 1 week for concepts, 1 week for revisions, 2 weeks for prototype creation, and 6 weeks for mass production.
Through our creativity, customer service, and commitment to quality, we were able to execute this project under a tight deadline, resulting in an effective, eye-catching display that helped increase sales for our customer.Juan Mata insists Manchester United are still a big draw

September 28With the Supreme Court's decision Monday to restrict state and local government from tougher gun control laws, some observers assumed that it would become a major issue and have a meaningful impact come November.
My bet is that, in terms of the midterm election, this decision will be a nothing-burger and not even cause a ripple. Not that there aren't people who often care deeply about gun rights or gun restrictions. But in an election year with two wars, a 9.7 percent unemployment rate and an environmental catastrophe on the Gulf Coast, there is just no room for cultural issues this year. This year is about very big issues -- not the kind of year in which social and cultural wedge issues can dominate.
Early in my career I found myself looking at individual campaigns only, feeling that the macropolitical dynamics and the national economic trends were more the stuff of cocktail party conversation and didn't actually impact House and Senate races. While the Cook Political Report has two very talented analysts who focus almost exclusively on the granular elements of American politics, individual races and the collective contests for majorities in the U.S. Senate, House and governorships, I find myself reading more economic reports and looking for broad trends that will drive these races from the top down, then meshing that with our traditional bottom-up microanalysis of individual races.
The country can't afford the stimulus that the economy desperately needs. But to spend more, or even cut taxes, puts us in an even greater debt cycle.
In an economic report to clients last week, the highly respected Wall Street economic and policy consulting firm International Strategy & Investment (ISI, not to be confused with the Pakistani intelligence agency) wrote about a "Disturbing Dichotomy in Beliefs" and focused on a division among investors about whether Germany was "taking the right steps by adopting fiscal austerity, and living within her means, accepting with maturity the limits of growth for her economy" or whether Germany's fiscal restraint was "risking precipitating a global double-dip," a second economic plunge.
The June 25 ISI Daily Economic Report then quoted a recent speech in Germany by billionaire investor George Soros saying, "Giving a speech in Berlin, I feel obligated to speak about the euro, because the euro is in crisis and Germany is the main protagonist. Doubts about sovereign credit are forcing reduction in budget deficits at a time when the banking system and the economy may not be strong enough to do without fiscal and monetary stimulus."
Reading Soros' talk about the situation in Europe made me think about the policy dilemma Washington faces. The U.S. economy is expected to grow at a real GDP growth rate of around just 3 percent for the next year and a half, certainly better than nothing but not strong enough to generate the kind of meaningful job growth we need to fully recover from the worst economic downturn since the Great Depression.
Unemployment has been between 9.7 percent and 9.9 percent since the beginning of this year and is not expected to get appreciably better between now and the election. Indeed, it looks like it will remain over 9 percent into next year and over 8 percent well into the presidential election year of 2012.
Regardless of one's feeling toward last year's economic stimulus package, much of the spending is behind us and the economy has slowed down from its 5.6 percent growth in the fourth quarter of last year.
At the same time, voters who had been warned for decades that government spending had grown out of control, that mounting deficits and exploding national debt were unsustainable, have finally gotten the message.
The economic crisis of 2008 terrified Americans. They have begun paying down their debts and saving more and have hardened their attitudes toward government, and they seem to be more interested in restraining government spending than they have been in a long time.
So in Washington, policymakers find themselves with an enormous dilemma. The country can't afford the stimulus that the economy desperately needs. After a couple of generations of simultaneous overspending and undertaxing, we now find ourselves in a very tough situation. The Federal Reserve Board's key interest rate is already at 0, boxing in the Fed's ability to spur borrowing with lower interest rates.
The solution isn't clear. To substantially cut spending and to raise taxes now would exacerbate a very weak economic situation and risk a double-dip recession.
But to spend more, or even cut taxes to goose the economy, puts us in an even greater debt cycle and makes us worry about whether there will be a painful "Grecian Formula" in our future. To be sure, Greece has more problems than we have, but the sovereign debt crisis facing European countries today could be an omen for us.
We have gotten ourselves into a very lousy situation, with intransigent positions by both the far left and far right exacerbating the situation. It's doubtful that this dilemma will dominate the campaign debates this fall, but there is still plenty that will be talked about that will ensure there's no room left for secondary, or tertiary, wedge issues.
Don't Miss Today's Top StoriesI’m a sucker for a well-executed wedding theme. Since a wedding is a pivotal part in the stories of our lives, it makes sense that we’re drawn to epic narratives to illustrate our own. Hollywood & literature gives ample inspiration for the look & feel of these recently popular wedding themes & engagement shoots from stylemepretty.com and greenweddingshoes.com.
Downton Abbey
This popular PBS series centers on this wedding inspiration shoot from Blue Dahlia Events. It’s inspired a host of other industries, including tea rooms which offered a Downton-inspired tea to celebrate the start of the new season Jan. 6.
Cheap Tips
- Shop vintage stores for the dress
- Shop for all-inclusive wedding packages at historical mansions, manors & B&Bs
The Great Gatsby
I know I’m not the only one looking forward to the upcoming adaptation of The Great Gatsby of F. Scott Fitzgerald’s 1925 novel of the same name. It releases May 10 (5 days after my birthday) and is directed by Baz Luhrmann, starring Leonardo DiCaprio. I bet we’ll see a lot of Gatsby-inspired looks at weddings this coming year, and for good cause. The art deco theme oozes with luxury, glam, vintage and character, like this St. Louis wedding:
- About the movie
- Wedding dress inspiration
- Etsy: Gatsby wedding headband
- Pinterest: Gatsby makeup and hair inspiration
- Pinterest: roaring 20s wedding inspiration
Cheap Tips
- Pick a recurring element & use throughout the wedding & reception decor: like strings of faux pearls, which are cheap to buy

Midcentury modern weddings always remind me of the weddings of our parents, which is holds the ultimate romantic nostalgia for this generation. This inspiration shoot combines that with the magic of New Year’s Eve – a great idea for anyone planning a wedding later this year.
Cheap Tips
- Marry at the court-house for a fitting 50s theme.
- Shop vintage stores for the dress & fur wrap
Moonrise Kingdom
I loved Wes Anderson’s recent film Moonrise Kingdom. It’s dark & quirky but sweet & hopeful. I kept thinking something super horrible was going to happen but it didn’t. I love the the woodsy, campy vintage scout look and think it’s a great wedding theme for outdoor weddings this fall. Think Peter Pan collars, vintage books, fur hats and branch arrangements. Check out this “elopement” inspiration shoot:

Cheap Tips
- Marry at a pubic park – for free!
- Ask to borrow antique and vintage finds from friends or from local shops
- Incorporate wood in the decor & furniture, as well as stacked vintage books for centerpieces.
Alice in Wonderland
Alice in Wonderland is a bit trippy to me, but I can see how it’s feminine whimsy provides plenty of wedding-day inspiration. Think muted jewel tones, vintage tea pieces, vintage literary books, playing cards & an outdoor setting like those that are featured in these inspiration shoots:
Cheap Tips
- Marry outside – it’s usually free!
- Use tulle throughout as an inexpensive material

Re: Comment on Notice No. 857 (proposed regulations to implement the "instant check" provisions of the "Brady Act").
Dear Sir or Madam:
Our organization strongly opposes the highly-intrusive regulations which BATF is proposing to implement the "Brady Act." It astounds us that an executive department of government, sworn to uphold the Constitution of the United States, should be so eagerly advancing the cause of nationally registering peaceful American firearms owners.
We realize that BATF officially will deny that the proposed regulations will implement a national registry of firearms owners as part of the national "instant check" system. The proposed regulations, however, will seek social security numbers and detailed personal information from registrants. We also know that the Justice Department, which will process the "instant checks," is not prevented from maintaining a national registry. And we know that all of the "instant check" data will reside in federal computer databases.
With national "instant check" comes national records, and that means a de facto national registry. Promises by a federal agency to protect privacy, or to never misuse information about firearms owners, are fairly worthless after the Waco massacre and the Ruby Ridge incident. In both of those cases, innocent people were killed by federal agents who were supposedly enforcing federal "gun control" laws. Those federal agents operated with federal information gathered through federal channels.
With these proposed regulations, however, BATF does not even promise any privacy for the firearms registration records. Instead, BATF proposes to leave privacy protection and data security regulations for the Department of Justice to devise.
It is an undisputed fact that the overwhelming majority of firearms owners are not violent criminals or firearms abusers. The proposed de facto national registration plan therefore is largely irrelevant to crime detection or prevention. The plan must have some other purpose.
The effects of the national "instant check" system are:
(1) to register nationally as many firearms owners as possible without their knowing assent,
(2) to accustom Americans to federal government intrusion into their minute daily affairs,
(3) to stigmatize firearms as dangers to society requiring federal control,
(4) to stigmatize firearms owners as criminal suspects needing federal monitoring and control,
(5) to serve as an intermediate step toward total federal control of firearms ownership, and
(6) to pave the way for future firearms confiscation and/or future persecution of firearms owners.
The national "instant check" regulations proposed by the BATF eerily follow the path of Nazi Germany. In his scholarly account of how the Nazi German government accomplished the Holocaust, Richard Lawrence Miller identified the five step process of genocide:
(1) identification of targeted persons as public menaces (and registering them),
(2) ostracism of the targeted persons,
(3) confiscation of the property of the targeted persons,
(4) geographical concentration of the targeted persons, and
(5) annihilation of the targeted persons. See Miller, Nazi Justiz: Law of the Holocaust (1995), p. 3.
Viewed under Miller's analysis, the BATF regulations effectively produce the results of at least three of these steps:
(1) The "instant check" system identifies firearms owners as a public menace (else they would not need to be tracked by federal law enforcement), and records the federal identification number, personal description and whereabouts of each owner. The Nazis employed comparable methods to identify and track Jews. (Nazi Justiz, pp. 24, 74, 192 n. 328.)
(2) The "instant check" stigmatizes firearms owners as a dangerous class of person, legally different from other citizens. The implicit message is that firearms owners, as persons who require national tracking, should be viewed with suspicion. Nazi government propaganda and rule-making against Jews, long before the concentration camp period, caused "Aryan" Germans to disassociate themselves from anything "Jewish," which resulted in ostracism of Jews from German society. (Nazi Justiz, pp. 43, 54-55, 69, 71-72.) The anti-firearms prejudice of federal registration laws likewise causes psychological and peer-group pressure which subtly threatens current and prospective firearms owners with ostracism.
(3) Registration of firearms and their owners in New York City made it possible to later confiscate those weapons. (See James Bovard, Lost Rights: The Destruction of American Liberty (1994), pp. 216-224.) The Nazis were able to easily confiscate the property of Jews because a law required Jews to register their personal property with the government. (Nazi Justiz, pp. 100-104.) The "instant check" database likewise will make it possible for federal agents to confiscate firearms.
Nothing in the text of the Constitution or the Bill of Rights empowers Congress or BATF to regulate firearms. The Second Amendment by its own language prohibits the federal government from infringing on the people's right to keep and bear arms. (See, e.g., U.S. Senate, "The Right to Keep and Bear Arms," Report of the Subcommittee on the Constitution of the Committee on the Judiciary (1982), p. 12). Accordingly, BATF should carry out its Constitutional duty to refrain from implementing any federal "gun control" laws.
But even if BATF does promulgate regulations under the "Brady" law, BATF should do so in a way that maximally protects the rights of private citizens. The proposed regulations run the opposite direction; they seem to be as intrusive as possible, maximizing federal power as much as possible, setting up springboards for further expansion of federal power. It is no wonder that BATF is viewed with so much hostility and suspicion by so many peaceful American citizens.
Our organization stands resolutely against the implementation of broader regulations under the "Brady" law. We urge BATF to distance itself from its tyrannical precursors in history, and to maximize freedom, protect the people's right to keep and bear arms, and restrain the growth of federal power.
Very truly yours,
Aaron Zelman

--Shazam's ACR Technology Powers Interactive TV for "American Idol"
--Time Warner Cable's TWC TV App to Offer Live Video Streaming on ICS Android Devices
--Blue Wave Media Taps Unicorn Media to Deliver Content to Connected TV's and Mobiles
--USA Network Offers Viggle-Powered Second-Screen Experience for "To Kill a Mockingbird"
Because the [itvt] editorial team has been working on The TV of Tomorrow Show 2012, we are covering stories in this issue in round-up/summary format.
- Automatic content recognition (ACR) specialist, Shazam (note: the London-based company is best known for offering a mobile application that consumers can use to identify music, as well as unlock supplemental content associated with TV shows--a process it calls "tagging"), announced Thursday that the rest of the current season of "American Idol" will be "Shazam-enabled." Viewers who use the company's app to tag the show will be able to access 1) a song list, with links to buy the featured music; 2) links to Twitter feeds from "insiders" and other viewers; 3) links to the show's official social media channels; and 4) video and photos from the show's Web site. Said Shazam CEO, Andrew Fisher: ."
In a blog post, Friday, Time Warner Cable announced that its TWC TV video-streaming app for Android devices--which launched late last year without live video support--will begin offering live video streaming "in a few weeks--definitely by Memorial Day." However, the MSO cautioned, the live video streaming will only work on Android devices running Ice Cream Sandwich, as the latter is "currently the only version of the Android OS that allows us the security and stability necessary to distribute video over our private network."
- Mobile monetization technology provider, Unicorn Media, announced last week that mobile cloud platform service provider, Blue Wave Media, has chosen its Unicorn Once technology to monetize and deliver content to connected TV's and mobiles for such customers as Porchlight Entertainment, Echobridge Entertainment and Moonbeam Entertainment. "Unicorn Once is a patented technology solution that enables the monetization of media content by allowing publishers to upload one file, one time and then deliver that video content via a single URL to any IP-enabled device such as iPad, iPhone, Android, Blackberry, Roku, connected TV's, game consoles and more," Unicorn Media states in its press materials. "Blue Wave Media utilizes Unicorn Once to deliver and monetize short- and long-form content to Internet-connected devices, enabling dynamic ad integration and real-time analytics across all platforms. Unicorn Once utilizes the native player or application player on each device, maintaining the flexible nature of the Blue Wave Media mobile cloud platform. Unicorn Once also provides real-time intelligence into content and ad performance across all devices through its real-time data warehouse, Unicorn Vision. The Blue Wave Media mobile cloud platform is an open-access, premier content delivery and mobile application platform which provides content publishers, studios, IPTV networks, television networks, second-screen offerings and corporate enterprises the ability to drive dynamic content and mobile app structure updates at any frequency. Blue Wave Media chose Unicorn Once for its flexible infrastructure and its ability to allow its customers to dynamically insert interstitial ads and monitor content or ad performance in real time on any device."
- Function(x), the company that recently launched the rewards-based social-TV loyalty-program app, Viggle, and subsequently acquired rival Loyalize (see the articles published on itvt.com, January 19th and February 20th), teamed with USA Network to enhance the latter's April 7th special presentation (in partnership with the AFI) of the classic movie, "To Kill a Mockingbird." "Fans will learn about iconic moments, celebrity recounts, exclusive photos and videos as they watch Universal's digitally remastered and fully restored classic being broadcast nationally for the first time," Function(x) and USA state in their press materials. ."

“Man on a Ledge” is the first excitement of 2012. Nick Cassidy (Sam Worthington) is hanging on the ledge, but there is more then meets the eye in this attempted suicide jump. Cassidy turns out to be an escaped inmate who is also a former cop. Serving twenty-five years for the biggest diamond heist in history. Cassidy proclaims his innocence and it soon looks like his ledge attempt is his way to prove that.
Cassidy is looking for someone on the force he can trust and request police psychologist Lydia Mercer (Elizabeth Banks). Lydia was recently front page news when her last negotiations did not go so well and they lost a rookie officer. When Lydia arrives on the scene something does not seem right. She suspects that this is not your typical jumper and wonder’s what else may be going on.
Soon after she tries to coax Cassidy off the ledge we discover his true motives for causing the scene in Manhattan. He has a microphone and ear piece on and is communicating with someone. It looks like Cassidy is willing to do whatever it takes to prove his innocence even if it means stealing the diamond back to prove he never stole and cut it up for distribution to begin with.
His plan of jumping is all a decoy that is going beautifully. However with time running out and allies against him he will only have one shot to get it right and prove his innocence. “Man on a Ledge” is a high energy thriller that had me on the edge of my seat throughout. Sam Worthington had a superb performance and I found myself rooting for him the entire time. The storyline is not plausible, but is the entertainment we all need to escape to every now & then. With so many surprises you will find yourself immersed with “Man on a Ledge” and excited to see the conclusion!Berlinterruption
Hey everyone, just a quick note to keep you in the loop – as mentioned previously I moved to Berlin last week. So far it’s been great but we’ve been coping with finding an apartment, setting up accounts for phones and banking, discovering where everything is in the neighborhood, dealing with jetlag, and not speaking any German. Happily most of these are conquered (except the language) but one thing we’ve discovered is that setting up Internet at home takes forever. So for the next couple of weeks I’m going to have to work from home and then find an Internet cafe to upload the pages. This isn’t ideal but it’s all I’ve got until we’re set up at home. Updates should resume shortly but I’m just letting you know what’s up before you start baying for blood.
In the meantime I’ll be appearing at the Strip Festival Breda in Holland Sept 8-9, and at the Journadas De Comic villa de Aviles in Spain, Sept 11-15. Hope to see you there!From Beth: Annmarie tells us what she thinks of the Grand Revival Ella Carry-all in an upcoming pattern review. Enjoy her tips, and head over to visit her blog at sewzenmama.

Hey, I know you!
How very cool!Keesee-Warren
Ashley Jean Keesee of Greenville and Gregory Robert Warren of Pittsburgh, Pa., exchanged vows in a double-ring ceremony April 28, 2012, at 5 p.m. at Saint Paul United Methodist Church, with the Rev. James H. Harry officiating.
The bride is the daughter of Mr. and Mrs. Kenneth David Keesee Sr. of Goldsboro and the granddaughter of Mrs. Sybil Landrum Keesee and the late Mr. Earl Kenneth Keesee and the late Mr. and Mrs. Kenneth Maxwell Herring Sr. of Goldsboro.
She graduated from North Carolina State University in Raleigh with a bachelor of science degree in social work and a master of science degree in counseling from East Carolina University in Greenville.
The groom is the son of Mr. and Mrs. Robert Marvin Warren of Mount Olive and the grandson of Mr. and Mrs. George Marvin Warren and Mr. and Mrs. Charles Wayne Shumate of Goldsboro.
He graduated from the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill with a double major in biology and exercise and sport science. He begins his eighth year as a NFL long snapper for the Pittsburgh Steelers.
The bride was escorted by her father and presented in marriage by her parents.
She wore an ivory strapless organza gown enhanced with motifs of pearls and crystals. The gown featured a scoop back and a criss-cross Alencon lace pattern. An encrusted sash with an Austrian crystal and pearl medallion accentuated the waistline. The dress featured a chapel-length train with matching appliques.
She wore her mother’s chapel-length veil, which was adorned with re-embroidered Alencon lace and pearls.
The bride carried a clutch bouquet of white peonies, roses, dendrobium orchids, freesia and Queen Anne’s lace with fresh greenery wrapped with white satin ribbon.
Robin Lear Peacock of Dudley, friend of the bride, was maid of honor.
Bridesmaids were Jessica Lamm Bailey of Wilson, Courtney Lauren Chewning of Goldsboro, Pamela Susanne Lewis of Greensboro, Alison Caroline MacDonagh of Sanford and Melanie Lackey Raynor of Wilson, friends of the bride.
Robert Marvin Warren, father of the groom, served as best man.
Groomsmen were Kenneth David Keesee Jr. of Goldsboro, brother of the bride; Michael Stephen Warren of Greenville, brother of the groom; and Daniel Wade Sepulveda of Austin, Texas, John Ashley Whitfield of Mount Olive and Matthew Gregory Wiggins of Dudley, friends of the groom.
Mrs. Jane Walston directed the wedding. Presiding at the register were Mr. and Mrs. Bela Nagypal VI, cousins of the bride. Miss Heather Sharpe and Miss Stephanie Sharpe, cousins of the groom, distributed programs.
Mrs. Heather Best, cousin of the bride, was Scripture reader.
A program of wedding music was provided by Alice Campbell, organist; Paige Barwick, violinist; and Miss Jordan Winslow and Mr. Jay Wheeler, vocalists.
Following the ceremony, the bride’s parents hosted a dinner reception and dance at Walnut Creek Country Club.
After a wedding trip to St. Barts and Anguilla, the couple will reside in Pittsburgh, Pa.

By News-Argus Staff
Published in Weddings on April 29, 2012 1:54 AMThe Pittsburgh Steelers dropped to 0-3 on the season thanks to their 40-23 loss Sunday night to Chicago Bears and below is the transcript of the Mike Tomlin press conference following the game courtesy of steelers.com.
Mike Tomlin: Obviously, you’re not going to win football games when you’re turning the ball over in the manner in which we did. It produced direct points. It produced other point opportunities. You’re not going to beat anybody in the NFL playing like that. We’ve got to get better. We know it. We understand it. It doesn’t make it any less painful but that’s just the reality of where we are. Not enough tonight. Not enough to overcome that. I don’t know if it will ever be enough to overcome that type of turnover deficit. We’ve got to take better care of the football. We acknowledge that those guys are one of the best in the world at getting it. We talked about it all week, but it did change the outcome of this football game, and for that we were below the line, obviously. We’ll continue to move forward in an effort to get better in that regard. Outcomes of games are simple in the NFL. It’s black and white. You’ve got to ring the scoreboard up, you’ve got to maintain possession of the ball and you’ve got to stop people. Obviously, we’re not putting together enough of a combination of those things to be victorious at this point.
Did you see some positives from the offense, or is that almost negated because of the turnovers?
You can’t turn the ball over like that. Obviously, there were some positives, but way too much negative, particularly from a turnover standpoint to be victorious, and that’s what we come in here to do is to win.
Re: Rotating the tackles:
They hadn’t played well enough to justify otherwise..
Is it possible that because of the way the offense struggled in the first two games that when Ben Roethlisberger sees certain opportunities he is not as careful as he might be?
No, I don’t believe that’s the case. We played to win tonight. We didn’t bring the baggage of past performances, per say, with us. We have to do a better job of taking care of the football, period.
As a coach you know what needs to be done and you can make the changes. How do you process what you can do to keep everybody focused on what you need to do to get out of this?
I expect them to. I’m not going to encourage them to. I’m not going to pat them on the back for sticking together, for continuing to work or for being mentally tough. I expect them to, and that’s what I just told them in there.
How did you think Heath Miller looked? Was he on any sort of a snap count?
He was on a snap count for obvious reasons. It was his first action. It was a good start. We’ll continue to progress with him. Obviously, it’s a positive thing having him back in uniform. He was an asset to us tonight.
You have a different week this week with going to London. What is the challenge there?
It’s not different for us until we get there. We don’t go until Thursday after work is done. So, between now and then it’s business as usual. That’s the approach we need to take. We’ve got a lot of work to do, obviously. So that is the approach we’ll take. We’ll deal with London when we get there.
You didn’t use Felix Jones after the fumble. Was it because of the fumble?
That was an element of it. Obviously, he took a legitimate hit there and we wanted to make sure he was okay. He was. He did get back in the game, but not a significant opportunity to contribute after that. Obviously, the game got a little bit one-sided at that point.
Was it just one of those nights in terms of Roethlisberger’s performance and turning the ball over so much?
We’ve got to take better care of the football. I’m not trying to characterize it in any way other than that.Love you too!

New Sky Bet customers: Free matched bet up to £30For those who have lived in Las Vegas since the mid-1980s and follow golf, the 2009 inductees to the Las Vegas Golf Hall of Fame will be familiar.
Dwaine Knight, the coach who took UNLV's program to a championship level, will be honored tonight at the induction banquet at TPC Summerlin. Joining Knight will be one of his former players, Edward Fryatt, along with longtime teaching professional Jimmie Bullard and golf writer and historian Jack Sheehan.
"It's a great honor for our program, not just for me personally," Knight said of going into the hall, which recently settled into its permanent home at Las Vegas National Golf Club. "The community has been so supportive in embracing our program and allowing us to play at the highest level."
Knight, who came to UNLV in 1987 from New Mexico, said he saw the potential for the sport to grow in Las Vegas early on.
"There was a can-do spirit in the town which intrigued me," he said. "I think I raised $50,000 at New Mexico, and when I got here I talked about raising $500,000 to endow the scholarship program. When I talked to people, they didn't see it as a big problem."
Knight got his money and then some. He rewarded his backers by winning the 1998 national championship, and UNLV remains an elite golf program.
Fryatt, who was taught the game by Bullard, went to Chaparral High School and played for Knight at UNLV. He went on to succeed as a professional, playing on the PGA Tour and winning more than $1 million in his career.
"It's a nice gesture for them to think of me," Fryatt said. "I've been out of the game four, five years, so when I got the call, it was somewhat of a surprise. But I was fortunate to grow up in this town where there were so many opportunities the game offers. It's nice to be recognized for all the hard work over the years."
Bullard, who has been teaching the game in Las Vegas since 1981 and still works at Palm Valley in Sun City Summerlin, said he didn't expect such an honor to be bestowed upon him.
"I guess it shows if you work hard and you're interested in helping other people, someone will notice," Bullard said.
For Sheehan, a former University of Oregon golfer who was a teammate of longtime PGA Tour player Peter Jacobsen, the honor is especially meaningful.
"I'm certainly not getting in for my playing ability," Sheehan said. "But it's nice to be recognized for chronicling the growth of the game and seeing it take off here."

Father, many Americans eat like this all the time without the benefit of public assistance, my family does. My husband works full time (at Safeway, meat department) and I'm a recent college graduate looking for work. We don't eat meat or go out to restaurants because we can't afford it. I don't purchase processed foods because they are too expensive. I cook from scratch, we eat whole foods. Seeds are cheap so I grow some vegetables in our tiny garden. We're healthy and we are better off eating this way. I shop at a local food wholesaler that is open to the public for deals such as a 25 pound bag of rice for $12.00, I buy 5 pounds of lentils for $3.00. With less money, you have to get creative. I shop in Oakland, CA where everything is expensive. I can still find good deals even in a big city. I think people need to learn how to cook and get back to simple living. It is possible, even in Oakland. BTW, I make amazing soups in my crockpot with lentils, rice, fresh or frozen vegetables, dried onions, Mrs. Dash seasoning, and water. Add some bread from the local budget bakery and that's a very inexpensive dinner. No reason for people to go hungry, especially if they have help in the form of food stamps. With $94.50 per week for the three of us, that would make my shopping so much easier...I spend far less money on food than that.

Oh yeah, there will be a new PSP at E3 all right, may have come to an end for us Android users with the release of Handmark‘s Express News. With 10,000-50,000 downloads, Express News has maintained a 4.5/5 score to an often-critical crowd. With all the buzz on this product, we figured it was time to give it a run.
Upon launching the application, Express News brought me to the general headlines display, listing 10 major stories that I would find atop any popular news portal on the web. A ‘get more stories’ button at the bottom grabs 10 more stories, listing them in ascending order from time published. From here, I checked out the article on Toys R Us’s acquisition of FAO Shwartz. It brought the article page at lightening speed (granted, I was connected over Wi-Fi), the story’s imagery intact.
Each story also has a “Share this” button, allowing you to send the link to your compadres via SMS or E-mail. It lacks a “Tweet this” button, which seems quite odd in the midst of the current Twitter-frenzy. If nothing else, it’d be nice if it tied into any of the Android Twitter apps already available.
And, for the sake of folks like me who can’t see 10 feet in front of them: You can change the text size quite easily.
Not only is the readability great, but the navigation setup is brilliant – but it needs a tutorial for first time users. Instead of going back to the main page or any category choice, users can ‘flip’ through articles and topics with a swipe of the finger. It’s a great feature for those who enjoy skim-reading; stories load fast enough that if the headline doesn’t grab you, the picture might. When, however, you do want to change the category of articles, just dropping ‘Express news’ bar at the top will display available categories including politics, general, and U.S. headlines to name a few.
Alas, it’s not all perfect. Our biggest qualm is with the lack of content customization. Though they claim to source from 300 sources, we’d like to be able to use this client for our sources – that is, RSS feeds. As far as we can tell, you’re stuck with what they give you.
The popularity and positive feedback of this quality application is most likely caused by its business model: instead of charging users, Express news is ad-supported. The advertisement is pretty non-intrusive, only seen at the top of the article selection pages. Free is great, but they really ought to figure out how much the average use brings in from ad-clicks in a few months or a year, and offer an ad-less version. Finally, if we can’t have RSS, at least give us localization. It’s a good news application; add local, nation and international news, and it’d be nearly perfect.
For the final price of free, this application is great; If you’re interested in the world around you and aren’t too interested in bringing in your favorite sites, it’s worth checking out. Everyone likes news, everyone likes free things; this app offers quality and no cost to the users.
What we liked:
- Great functionality, with a design fit specifically for the Android platform
- Incredibly performance – As I was playing with this app for an hour or so, I didn’t encounter one performance related issue
- News-paper feel, with flipping of the pages
- Ability to share articles of SMS and E-mail
- We like free things, everyone does
What we didn’t like
- No premium application, you’re forced to look at ads
- Lack of RSS feeds, or at least localization – This is a big minus

118501524 is a 27yr-old single woman in Keene, New HampshireView ProfileFor the last several years we’ve made a trip to the local U-pick farm to go blueberry picking. This year we just barely made it before the farm closed for the year, so pickings were slim! But we had a great time as always.
Not only do the kids love picking the blueberries, but they also love getting to see the chickens and pigs, and getting to sit and play on the tractor. I love coming home with fresh picked blueberries and stocking up on local, raw honey at a good price!
Isaac’s blueberry picking skills could use a little work, but at least this time he didn’t pick any green ones!
If you have a U-pick farm nearby, I highly recommend hitting it up before blueberry season is over. Before you go, check out Blueberries for Sal to read to the kids. (I had Charlotte read it to Isaac on the way there!)
We love blueberries just on their own, but I also made this delicious blueberry syrup for blueberry spritzers and Italian sodas. It’s the perfect summertime treat, and a healthy alternative to soda. Of course, I think this blueberry syrup would taste great on pancakes or drizzled over vanilla ice cream as well. The possibilities are endless!
Blueberry Spritzer or Italian Soda Recipe
To make blueberry syrup:
2 cups blueberries (fresh or frozen)
2 cups water
1/3-1/2 cup honey (or maple syrup)
squeeze of lemon juice
mint, lavender (optional)
Add blueberries, water, and honey to a saucepan and bring to a boil. Reduce heat and simmer for 20 min. Use a potato masher to mash blueberries. Allow to cool.
Strain blueberries out using a strainer and smashing any remaining blueberries with the back of a spoon to get all the delicious juices out.
Pour strained blueberry juice back into the saucepan, add squeeze of lemon and optional mint leaves or lavender buds and bring to a boil again. Reduce heat and simmer for 10 min. or until the mixture is reduced by half.
Cool and strain out any add-ins.
To make spritzer:
Fill glass with ice, add 1/4 cup blueberry syrup and fill to top with soda water.
To make Italian soda:
Fill glass with ice, add 1/4 cup blueberry syrup, 1/4 cup half & half, and fill to top with soda water.
Here’s a few more yummy ways to enjoy blueberries:
- Kale Salad with Apples, Blueberries & Goat Cheese
- Breakfast Quinoa
- Blueberry Honey Homemade Ice Cream | Gidget Goes Home
Thanks for this recipe. this weekend I would try to make this blueberry spritzer for my family. I think, it is very easy to make this one.
I love to try this tasty beverage, but perhaps without soda.
The Italian Soda Recipe looks really nice and it is something I really would like to try.Model Hand Project

New Otterbase Launched
Now, with a new brand, retooled Web site and new corporate headquarters, Otterbase is looking forward to its next stage of growth.
“In 2005, we popped up on everyone’s radar,” said CEO Bill Bennett.
Known until recently as Otterbase Technical Services, or OTS, the company last year won the Ernst & Young Entrepreneur of the Year award, was named one of 50 companies to watch by the Robert Lowe Foundation, and was honored as a Cool Company to Work For by the Business Journal and Crain’s Detroit Business.
Last year marked its eighth straight year of at least 40 percent growth. Its revenues grew by 50 percent. The firm is currently growing in almost every conceivable manner — revenue, employees, real estate and profit. Net profit grew in 2005 by nearly 250 percent.
“The first five years were investment years,” said Bill Bennett. “We were putting everything back into the business to make it better, and now we’re realizing the fruits of that.”
Earlier this month, Otterbase opened a
Otterbase is also leaving its home at
“This should sustain us for many years,” said President Jeff Bennett, who currently is sharing an office because of the company’s rapid growth. “It seems like we’ve had to move every few years.”
The brothers had hoped to stay in downtown, but were not able to find any buildings to accommodate a company their size. The Bennetts wanted to own their new headquarters, and had no desire, or means, to buy one of the large, core downtown buildings.
Instead, they opted for a multi-million-dollar investment in the new location, overlooking downtown rather than in it.
As part of the name change and new branding campaign, Otterbase is able to better represent its wide range of staffing services, including information technology, engineering, clinical and light industrial, among others.
Also, it re-establishes the firm with a new philosophy, Jeff Bennett explained.
“In that past, we’ve ‘passion sold’ our services: ‘We can do it better,’” he said. “Now, we are beginning to develop tangible, sustainable qualities. We’re able to track our performance against competitors and sell more as a value-added service, not a commodity.”• Productinformatie •

BEFORE THE ADMINISTRATOR
IN THE MATTER OF ) ) BONANZA VALLEY AVIATION, INC. AND ) I. F. & R. DOCKET NO. THOMAS R. KIEFER, APPLICATOR ) VII-1309C-97P ) Respondents )
ORDER GRANTING MOTION FOR ACCELERATED
DECISION AS TO LIABILITY AND PENALTY
Under consideration is Complainant's motion for accelerated decision as to both liability and penalty, filed October 16, 1998. The complaint charges that Respondent violated Section 12(a)(2)(F) of the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act ("FIFRA"), 7 U.S.C. § 136j(a)(2)(F), when it aerially applied the pesticide FURADAN 4F INSECTICIDE - NEMATICIDE ("Furadan")(1) in a manner not in accordance with FIFRA § 3(d), 7 U.S.C. § 136a(d). Pursuant to Section 14 of FIFRA, 7 U.S.C. § 136l, Complainant seeks assessment of an administrative penalty of $5,000.
THE COMPLAINT
According to the complaint, Respondent Bonanza Valley Aviation, Inc., a Minnesota corporation, through its employee, pesticide applicator Thomas Kiefer,(2) applied Furadan to five cornfields in Iowa from July 6 through July 10, 1996.(3) The complaint further alleges that Mr. Kiefer was not a "certified applicator" as that term is defined under FIFRA § 2(e)(1), 7 U.S.C. § 136(e)(1), and that Furadan is a restricted use pesticide ("RUP") which bears the following statement on its labeling: "For retail sale to and application only by certified applicators or personnel under their direct supervision." Pursuant to FIFRA § 3(d)(1)(C)(I), 7 U.S.C. § 136a(d)(1)(C)(I), a RUP may be applied for any use to which the restricted classification applies only by or under the direct supervision of a certified applicator. Complainant contends that Respondent's aerial application of Furadan to the five cornfields contravened FIFRA § 3(d) and therefore constitutes a violation of FIFRA § 12(a)(2)(F).
As to the penalty, Complainant maintains that, evaluating the particular facts and circumstances of the alleged violations in light of the factors set forth in FIFRA § 14, and the EPA's FIFRA Enforcement Response Policy ("ERP"), a penalty in the amount of $5,000 is appropriate in the instant case.
FINDINGS AND CONCLUSIONS
Liability
Consolidated Rule 22.20(a) provides for entry of an accelerated decision only where there are no genuine issues of material fact in dispute and the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law. 40 C.F.R. § 22.20(a). Complainant urges that Respondent has admitted the allegations in the complaint, leaving no material facts in dispute, and that Complainant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law. Respondent has not opposed Complainant's motion.
Complainant presents the briefest of arguments in support of its motion. Complainant simply points to the letter Respondent submitted in response to the complaint and asserts that, because Respondent did not specifically deny the factual allegations made in the complaint, those allegations should be deemed admitted pursuant to Consolidated Rule 22.15, 40 C.F.R § 22.15.(4) Complainant observes that Respondent in its letter in answer to the complaint did not indicate when it filed its application for certification; that Respondent's president, Mr. Jackson merely asserts that due to some "confusion" its "application sat on someones [sic] desk at Des Moines" and was not processed until July 19, 1996; and that Respondent did not deny that the Furadan applications occurred as alleged in the complaint. Based on these admissions, Complainant urges that no material issues of fact remain in dispute and that Complainant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.
Complainant adds that although Warren Jackson, President and owner of Respondent corporation, has told Complainant that the corporation has ceased to exist and therefore cannot be held liable, Bonanza Valley Aviation is still a registered corporation in the State of Minnesota and Mr. Jackson has submitted no documentation to the contrary.(5) In support of its contention that Respondent continues to exist, Complainant submitted documents from the Minnesota Department of State. These documents include Respondent's articles of incorporation, which show the duration of the corporation as "perpetual," and a Notice of Change of Registered Office filed by Respondent in September 1996. Attachment D to Complainant's Motion. Complainant also submitted an undated report, apparently from Lexis, indicating that Respondent is still an active corporation. Id.
Respondent's letter in answer to the complaint does not directly respond to the factual allegations made in the complaint and those allegations are therefore deemed admitted by Respondent pursuant to Consolidated Rule 22.15(d). While Respondent's letter failed to respond to the factual allegations of the complaint, Respondent does offer what can be considered a defense to the violation charged. Respondent stated that, because it had been licensed in Iowa for several years and Minnesota, Respondent's home state which has reciprocity with Iowa, it was Respondent's understanding that it could begin applications of pesticide as soon as it arrived. Without any evidence to support its "understanding," however, Respondent's defense must be rejected.
In addition to Respondent's admissions, examination of documents submitted by Complainant with its motion and as part of its prehearing exchange, supports the charges leveled in the complaint. The reports and documentation provided by Kenneth Scott, a pesticide investigator with the Iowa Department of Agriculture and Land Stewardship ("IDALS"), consequent to his investigation of alleged pesticide misuse, support the allegations in the complaint relating to the time, place and identity of the pesticide applicator. CX 2-2F, 3-3C. In the course of his initial investigation and subsequent follow-ups at Twin-State Engineering and Chemical(6) in Hampton, Iowa, Scott gathered documentation of the violations. Most significantly, he was provided with work orders covering each of the pesticide applications cited in the complaint and listing the applicator as Tom Kiefer c/o Bonanza Valley Aviation. CX 2D and 3C. Also included in Scott's report are photos of a Furadan label, including the portion of the label where Furadan is identified as a RUP. CX 2F, photo 28.
The allegation that the Furadan was not applied by a certified applicator is supported by Respondent and Mr. Kiefer's commercial applicator licenses, both of which are dated July 19, 1996. Attachment A to Complainant's Motion. In addition, the license applications of Respondent and Mr. Kiefer indicate they were not received by IDALS until July 11, 1996, the day after the last application cited in the complaint. Id. These documents demonstrate that Respondent did not have the required certification at the time of the cited pesticide applications.
Respondent's admissions, and the documents submitted by Complainant, establish that no issues of fact remain in dispute and that Complainant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law on the issue of liability.
Penalty
Assessment of penalties for FIFRA § 12 violations is guided by FIFRA § 14. In determining the appropriate penalty, FIFRA § 14(a)(4) directs consideration of the size of the business charged, the effect on the person's ability to continue in business and the gravity of the violation.
In addition to the guidance provided by the statute itself, EPA has produced a FIFRA ERP to provide further guidance and to help ensure equitable treatment of violators. Computation of a penalty using the ERP is a five stage process. Stages one and two, respectively, involve a determination of the gravity, or level, of the violation, using appendix A of the ERP, and a determination of the size of the business. In stage three, the gravity of the violation and the size of the business are plotted on a matrix provided in Table 1 of the ERP to determine a base penalty amount. In stage four factors which may warrant an upward or downward adjustment to the base penalty amount are considered and given numerical values as provided in appendix B to the ERP. Table 3 of the ERP is then consulted to determine whether an upward, downward or no adjustment is warranted to the total gravity value. Stage five provides for consideration of the effect of the penalty on the violator's ability to continue in business.
Complainant proposes that a penalty of $5,000 be assessed. Complainant addresses no argument to the issue of penalty in its motion. The penalty worksheet provided with the complaint makes it clear, however, that the penalty was calculated using the ERP. The worksheet offers the following calculation of Respondent's base penalty. As a commercial applicator, Respondent is subject to civil penalties under FIFRA § 14(a)(1) which provides for a maximum penalty of $5,000 for each offense. A FIFRA § 12(a)(2)(F) violation is classified as level 2 in appendix A of the ERP. In the absence of any information provided by Respondent, its business is classified as size category 1, revenues of more than $1 million per year.(7) Plotting a level 2 violation committed by a category 1 business on the penalty matrix for FIFRA § 14(a)(1) yields a base penalty amount of $5,000.
The penalty worksheet next addresses the gravity adjustment factors of pesticide toxicity, harm to human health, harm to the environment, violative history, and culpability. Furadan is classified as a toxicity category 1 pesticide because the warning language on its label says "Danger." A category 1 pesticide is given a pesticide toxicity gravity value of two. Harm to health and harm to environment were both classified by Complainant as minor, resulting in entry of a gravity value of one for each factor. Complainant assessed a gravity value of two for Respondent's violative history. This corresponds to a commercial applicator with one prior FIFRA violation. Under culpability Complainant assessed a gravity value of two for negligence. Respondent's total gravity adjustment value as calculated by Complainant was eight. Following Table 3, a value of eight warrants assessment of the base penalty with no upward or downward adjustment.
Respondent's answer to the complaint does offer arguments or defenses bearing on the issue of the appropriate penalty. Respondent maintains that, because it was responding to a request for immediate help and because Respondent did go through the certification process as required, it was not negligent as indicated in the complaint. This argument is rejected. Respondent has been in the commercial pesticide application business since 1977 and should be well aware of the need to obtain certification before applying a RUP. It is reasonable and appropriate to characterize Respondent's failure to obtain certification before performing the applications cited in the complaint as negligent. Moreover, there is no support for Respondent's argument in the record. Respondent's argument that it "understood" it could begin applying as soon as it arrived in Iowa must also be rejected. Respondent has not produced any evidence or explanation to indicate why it "understood" that it would be allowed to violate FIFRA as it did.
Consideration of two additional factors included in the ERP but not accounted for in the penalty worksheet, voluntary disclosure and ability to pay, does not change the penalty amount. The facts show that this action was not initiated in response to Respondent's voluntary disclosure, but rather as a consequence of a citizen complaint and subsequent investigation by Smith of IDALS. As for ability to pay, although informed in the complaint of its right to have its financial condition considered in mitigation of the proposed penalty, Respondent has not raised it as an issue in this proceeding. Respondent's failure to raise its ability to pay as an issue constitutes a waiver of any objection to the penalty on ability to pay grounds. In re New Waterbury, Ltd., 5 EAD 529, 542 (Remand Order, EAB, Oct. 20, 1994).
Overall Complainant's penalty calculation is appropriate and supported by the facts. However, Complainant's assignment of a value of two under violative history, which indicates one prior violation, is without support in the record. Complainant has neither referred specifically to any previous FIFRA violation committed by Respondent, nor submitted documents showing a previous violation committed by Respondent. Lowering the value to zero, the value for a Respondent with no history of violations, reduces Respondent's overall gravity adjustment score to six. With a total of six points, Respondent is due a 20% reduction in penalty under the ERP. Consequently, Respondent's base penalty of $5,000 will be reduced by 20%, or $1000, for a total penalty of $4,000.
ACCORDINGLY, IT IS ORDERED that Complainant's motion for accelerated decision as to liability and penalty IS GRANTED.
FURTHER, IT IS FOUND that that Respondent violated Section 12(a)(2)(F) of the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act, 7 U.S.C. § 136j(a)(2)(F), when it aerially applied the pesticide FURADAN 4F INSECTICIDE - NEMATICIDE in a manner not in accordance with FIFRA § 3(d), 7 U.S.C. § 136a(d).
FURTHER, IT IS ORDERED that, pursuant to Section 14 of FIFRA, 7 U.S.C. § 136l, Respondent is assessed an administrative penalty of $4II

That was how I closed off yesterday's Blog following the loss in Edmonton on Saturday night and that, ladies and gentlemen, is why I generally stay away from the prognostication game, because it is nothing but a Fool's Game … those who do it end up looking like fools, as it is an impossible game to play.
Apparently, so was last night's encounter with the 15th place Colorado Avalanche for the Vancouver Canucks, as the visitors out-everythinged the Canucks in a 4-1 win at GM Place. It wasn't even close. Men against boys stuff.
I labeled the defeat to the Oilers a “good loss,” a game that they deserved a better fate in for various reasons. This Blog had a multitude of potential names and the word “good” definitely was no where within the thought process, that's for sure.
Brutal? Embarrassing? Pathetic?
You name it, the options are endless.
Instead I went with “Short & Not-So Sweet,” liking the symbolism to the effort put forth by my team and the fact that this game pissed me off so much that I just don't want to write anything about it … so it will be a short Blog and there won't be any niceties being bandied about. No talk of travel and tons of games in very few nights or tradegdy striking. No Silver Linings that are usually there if you look for them, because I don't want to look … the Boys didn't seem to care so much, so why should I?
The Av's were winless in 8 coming in and played this game without 4 of their Blueliners (replaced by guys with a total of 14 games-worth of NHL experience!) and 4 of their top-6 forwards and they held the Canucks to 5 shots on goal in the first 27-plus minutes of the game? This being a game that would have given the Canucks a true chance at capturing the North West Division and they come out and crap the bed like that?
Brutal? Embarrassing? Pathetic?
You name it, the options are endless.
The team that prides itself on defensive responsibility and playing in tight 5-man units has given up 14 goals in its last 3 games looked like The Keystone Cops at a Garage Sale in their own end, and that could be considered a compliment?
Brutal? Embarrassing? Pathetic?
You name it, the options are endless.
Mats Sundin, who The Mark's were endlessly gushing about on HNIC on Saturday night because he's soooo big and strong behind the opposition's goal line, when last I checked there is another 195 feet or so of ice that needs to be skated upon during a hockey game, “played” just over 13 minutes, and not only was he at his Glacial-best skating even slower than “normal,” but he handled the puck as if it was radioactive in this game.
Brutal? Embarrassing? Pathetic?
You name it, the options are endless.
Willie Mitchell, Sami Salo, Ryan Kesler, Pavol Demitra … while not quite worthy of me copying & pasting those same 10 words again, were pretty damn close to being under the same classifications.
There's really no need to go on is there?
Coach V kept it short and not so-sweet afterwards (I love this guy!) with the following courtesy of Ed Willes' Monday Musings in today's Vancouver Province …
“Could you tell that by the 40 blocked shots and the 100 missed passes?” coach Alain Vigneault said when it was pointed out his team was nowhere to be found on this night. “I sort of picked up on that, too.”
The Grades … the “special games” get special grades, and this one is nothing but an Epic Fail for the team.

More Provocation as the Deadline for the State's Interference in Native Business Nears
The rural nature of Tonawanda alone make a State Trooper presence unnecessary. There are only three reasons to go to Tonawanda; you live there, you have friends there or you shop there. State officials do not live there, they have no friends there and their business is not welcome. The sign could not be clearer.
The only thing as clear as the sign is the intent of some of these cowboys to participate in the State's on-going provocation of Native people. Invariably as tensions rise intelligence falls. You see and hear it in the words of prominent political figures like Mike Bloomberg suggesting the brandishing of shotguns to show who's boss or comments from the State governor acknowledging the potential for violence and even death but quoting for the newspapers, "There will be quite an uprising and protest to this but I am going to maintain this policy." And now, almost like answering the call to Bloomberg's call to "cowboy up" against the Indians, certain Troopers are willing to show their ignorance.
The best way for both the Native people, who will be sure to respond to the State's aggression, and the State Police, who will be used as the State's pawns, to ensure their own safety would be for them to form a somewhat unholy alliance where both sides agree to make as big, as spectacular and as expensive, while entirely peaceful, a demonstration of the State's futile efforts as possible. Everyone with their Warrior shirts and flags; flex your muscle and show your strength and resolve while you boys in the blue cars; bring entirely too many of yourselves to our reservation borders, collect your overtime and "hazard" pay, spend every dime of your State paid per diems and let's let the fools in Albany wallow in their stupidity.

I Finally Got the Return Call, But They Won't Put It in Writing
I've mentioned previously on one of my comments that I called the New York State Department of Taxation and Finance to inquire on their "Indian Commerce" policies. Three weeks after my initial call I received a call back from the department's Office of Counsel. I asked what the State's policy is and would be after September 1st regarding Native to Native commerce and the sales and distribution of Native brands of tobacco products from territory to territory. The caller made it crystal clear that the State intends to stop any shipments of product that leave a reservation regardless of whether the product was produced or manufactured by Native people and regardless if the transaction is in the commission of trade between Native people on Native lands. When pressed where the State feels it has the right to interfere with Native to Native trade the caller suggested that there was case law that supported their position. I reminded her that the case law she refers to was specifically based on the premise that the tobacco sold by the Native retailers in Montana and Washington at the time had no value added to products by the Native people. Clearly this was no longer the case now that 70 - 80% of the product sold by Native retailers are Native brands and clearly a sustainable business can now exist entirely off those brands. The caller then suggested that the State would only consider value having been added if was done in the community that it was sold in. In other words; Native people could not manufacture a product and sell it to Native people from another Native territory without the State's regulation. When I continued to pressed her on the notion that the State would even stop, and indeed did so last week, a Seneca wholesaler from transporting a Native product from the Seneca Territory of Cattaraugus to the Seneca Territory of Allegany, she backed off some saying that the State would stop shipments going from one Nation to another. She said she couldn't comment on last week's seizure and speculated on various reasons that could have been in play.
The bottom line is that the State is so emboldened by new legislation and case law from places that are far from the territories and people of the Haudenosaunee (geographically and politically) that they are actually saying they will prohibit Native to Native commerce that doesn't comply with State law. I couldn't get the Office of Counsel to provide a written policy statement saying such because they don't want to use language that in any way addresses Native commerce distinct from State commerce. As far as the State is concerned our trade is their business.
We obviously cannot stand for this. We also cannot allow Native to Native commerce be reduced to a situation where only the tribes are allowed to conduct commerce under a concept of Nation to Nation commerce. This will be the ultimate sell out by tribal leadership and will make them complicate in criminalizing the private sector economies of our territories; the few that are left. Native people challenging the State's authority in front of white men under black robes is only slightly better than white men under white hoods. The laws these men live and judge by are as racist and outdated as the Klan. A system of laws that allows hundreds of distinct sovereign societies to be lumped together so that precedent can be established upon the weakest and imposed on those where no such ruling could be made on its own merits is no system at all. It is a sham.

A Submission from an Anonymous Reader
Judge Arcara’s ruling is in. The glimmer of hope is distinguished. It really should come as no surprise that once again, and for hundreds of years, the Native American Indian has not be given a favorable decision by the white man’s court..

Seized Cigarettes Will Be Given Back to Seneca Retailer
Posted: Wednesday, 11 August 2010 6:29PM
Rachel Kingston Reporting
rkingston@entercom.com
Buffalo, NY (WBEN/AP) -- New York State is going to return a truck full of cigarettes that was seized by taxing agents on Monday to the Seneca retailer to whom it belongs.State Taxation and Finance Spokesman Brad Maione said Wednesday that Monday's stop and seizure was not illegal, but officials who've reviewed of the facts of the case have nontheless chosen to give the truck and its contents back to Aaron Pierce. Maione would not elaborate on what specifically led tax officials to change their minds.Agents who made the seizure on Monday said that they did so because the cigarette cartons weren't stamped properly. But the Senecas question that explanation, since taxation of Native American tobacco products is currently not permitted under New York State law.Pierce contends that the seizure is an act of retaliation. He and 140 other Seneca businesses have filed lawsuits against a new federal law, known as the PACT Act. It bans the shipment of cigarettes in the mail. The Senecas are currently trying to have it declared unconstitutional.At the time of the seizure, the cigarettes were being shipped from one Seneca reservation to another.Seneca Nation President Barry Snyder said Wednesday the tribe is demanding an explanation from Governor Paterson."Why did the state make a move on something that's been going on for a number of years?" Snyder asked. "Why is that process starting in August of this year? [Does it pertain] to the legislation that was passed for September 1 of this year? Or is it something to do with the federal case that's going on, over the PACT Act? I have no idea, at this point."Snyder was referring to the measure that state lawmakers approved earlier this summer, that would authorize the state to collect sales taxes on Seneca tobacco products that are sold to non-Indians. That new law is scheduled to take effect on September 1.

Thursday thoughts: Chilly Gillies
Anyone who looks at this game’s box score and says it must have been a close, physical, contested game because it finished 2-1 to Lowell isn’t completely wrong about that.
But the fact of the matter is that the only reason it finished anywhere near that close wears No. 32 for Providence College and put on a downright magnificent performance in stopping 48 of 50. But that tells the whole story right there, doesn’t it? Lowell put 50 (that’s fifty, five-zero) shots on Gillies and that it only scored twice was somewhat miraculous. The freshman netminder opposite Connor Hellebuyck, who was strong in his own right but not asked to do nearly as much in stopping either the quantity or quality of shots his counterpart faced, turned aside a good three or four pucks over the first two periods that absolutely should have hit twine and not pad.
To paraphrase Jurassic Park, Lowell found a way. It carried play throughout the game, registering 32 shots in the first two periods before putting up the final 18 in the third, and were only held off the scoresheet by Gillies’ brilliant showing, rather than anything the PC defense was doing to limit chances. There were lots of them. Take, for example, Gillies using his pad to stop Ryan McGrath and Derek Arnold from more or less the same spot at the bottom of the left faceoff circle in the first period, the former being far more important and impressive because it followed an egregious own-zone giveaway and gave McGrath a clean look (not that he put much on the shot). Or take the save that’s going to be on every highlight reel at the end of the season and was undoubtedly the play of the game, when he stopped Adam Chapie cold in the second period on a shorthanded 3-on-1 that featured some gorgeous interplay between all three Lowell attackers.
But that’s getting a little ahead of ourselves. Let’s circle back and say again that Lowell outright dominated this game in a very real and serious way. Yes, they gave up 32 shots to Providence, but that speaks to the wide-open nature of the game moreso than any kind of defensive ineptitude. There were more grade-A chances for the Friars than we would have liked, obviously, but you can’t complain too much when you only give up one goal.
However, with that having been said we will note that we aren’t feeling too great about the way Providence was able to successfully break Lowell down toward the end of each period. They spent vast stretches of the first, second, and third on their heels and hoping against hope that Gillies would bail them out (and far more often than not, he obviously did that) but as each frame wore on, the teams found those roles slowly reversed. This was particularly worrisome in the first and third periods, when Lowell was hemmed in its own zone for considerable stretches and Providence multiplied its shot totals for the period by three or four. Not that Hellebuyck and the defense weren’t up for the challenge, but getting worn down to a nub and waiting to be saved by the bell isn’t something we’d prefer against a team as decidedly mediocre as these Friars.
All the wearing-down on both sides obviously came to a head in the third period, when all three goals in the game were scored in the space of 4:29. The first came from McGrath and on the power play, which seemed more like one of those eventualities for which everyone just seemed to be waiting around than anything else, thanks to the Friars’ insistence on taking penalties pretty regularly throughout the game.
And so it was that Brandon Tanev got the puck on and tried to clear, but did so in a very strange way: by putting it along the ice and right at Christian Folin’s tape. Folin went to his opposite D Zack Kamrass, who then fed it through the seam created by Tanev scrambling around like an idiot, where it got to McGrath. And then the decision by the wily freshman to headfake Myles Harvey, who’s a pretty good Hockey East defenseman, instead of just shooting right away made all the difference. That bought him the space he needed, and Gillies just waved at the wrister as it went by him. Keen-eyed observers, by the way, will note that this goal came from pretty much the exact same spot from which he picked up his two assists at Vermont last weekend: just inside the top of the right circle. This time he didn’t need anyone to tip it for him, though.
Providence answered with a nice goal from Ross Mauermann (who else?) on a nifty bit of handsiness from Mark Jankowski to shake loose of two or three defenders. Hellebuyck didn’t have much of a chance coming across the goalmouth given that it was a nice shot, but that’s just how things go sometimes.
But for those who worried there might not be any more goals in this game given how both freshmen were playing between the pipes, Chad Ruhwedel — who was the best skater on the ice tonight by a mile or two — allayed those fears just 26 seconds after Mauermann leveled. The shot was a good enough one, given that it got on net, and the screen McGrath of all people (size-wise) was plenty to sneak it by Gillies.
We would be remiss, though, in not highlighting that the goal came from Ruhwedel, and the primary assist from Joe Houk. Then also please take note that the McGrath goal came from Kamrass and Folin. That’s four points from the defense, and that’s now officially a trend; in the last seven games, Lowell’s defensemen have seven goals and 18 assists. A legitimately crazy number, we’re sure you’d agree. Even moreso given that the D only had 1-8-9 in the first 13 of the season. Do you think there’s a reason Lowell’s on a nine-game PK run (the ‘Hawks went 2 for 2 tonight, those killers of 34 in a row), the power play is inching ever-closer to 20 percent, and the team has won eight straight.
We’ll put this as plainly as possible: We didn’t see much reason to be impressed with Providence apart from Gillies, and now, having sat through this game, we feel more or less the same way. If not for Gillies, this nationally-televised tilt is as much of a nailbiter as the Harvard game. Even if he doesn’t bring his A-plus-plus-plus game, it’s at least 3- or 4-1 instead of merely being 2-1. Anyone who tries to tell you different is a raving lunatic. This was only a tough loss for the Friars in the context of “their goalie kept them afloat when they were doing all they could to drill holes in the bottom of the lifeboat.” Lowell won anyway. On and on it goes.
This stretch has been wonderful to see. That game was fantastic to be at (and yes, Gillies is that good). Now Lowell faces a tough BU team. If they can walk away with a win on the road, that’s followed by two against NU … the climb could and should very much continue. Go Hawks!
Lowell has found a great goaltender in Connor Hellebuyck! I believe he deserves to be in net once again on Saturday versus BU. Let’s go Lowell!Got a minute?

Only in the fabulous world of Fallout could one catch a flick one minute, and become a scrub fitted science experiment the next. Per the instructions of the Mysterious Broadcast, you show up at the Mojave Drive-in at the witching hour to check out the Midnight Science Fiction Feature. All you find is an odd, damaged satellite. Further inspection suddenly has you whisked away to Big Mt., a.k.a. The Big Empty (get it?).
Waking up, you find yourself in the midst of the Think Tank – a collective of five talking brains. This overly eccentric bunch expresses their amazement of how you’ve not only survived, but can still function properly after having your brain, heart, and spine replaced with synthetic implants. Before you can utter your repulsion, the brains task you with collecting a set of scientific wares to aid them in their neverending battle against their evil cranial nemesis: Dr. Mobius! That’s right, no concern for reason or your well-being applies. It’s the way of Fallout.
Much is different compared to the previous DLCs. For starters, there are no limitations to the amount of gear you can bring with you prior to starting the adventure. Secondly, you actually get to listen to some tunes on the Pip-Boy this time around. And most importantly, you’re promptly given a home base, The Sink, where you can heal and purchase items and equipment. To give it more flavor, The Sink is also home to a number of sentient appliances, all of which provide an array of sidequests for upgrading their functionalities. Along with the Think Tank’s need for sputtering nonsensical comic mayhem via loudspeaker, the talking tools round up the entire experience as a zany MST3K tribute of sorts. This is made possible by a fantastic voice cast of the industry’s finest, such as Roger Cross (Joshua from First Wave), Beau Weaver (Marvel Action Hour’s Mr. Fantastic), James Urbaniak (Go Team Venture!), and the hot plate of Yes herself, Veronica Belmont.
Perhaps the biggest dissimilarity is the fact that this is the only New Vegas DLC that is absent of companions. So when you’re being gangbanged by legions of Robo-Scorpions, undead Trauma Suits, Lobotomites, Nightstalkers, or any combination of the above, you’re on your own. For the most hardcore of Fallout fans, this provides a welcomed challenge. Those still wet behind the ears may find this unfair, as even if you’re at the level 15 minimum, or thrice more, the task of handling unrelenting foes in numbers can be overwhelming. Those like me, who appreciate companions as a method for fleshing out stories, cannot deny the untapped potential.
Regarding the story, Old World Blues’s main narrative is bare bones, but like New Vegas, the intrigue comes from the underlying tales that wait to be uncovered. In this case, much of the big questions about the Mojave are answered in The Big Empty. You’ll learn how the Mojave’s exclusive mutated wildlife came to be. And much of the unresolved questions from your time at the Sierra Madre will be answered, all the while gaining more insight into Ulysses, the elusive “other courier”. Also lying in wait are a number of the best weapons science has to offer. Don’t be surprised if you missed anything during your first run. With 35 locations, stones will be left unturned. But thankfully, you can return to the Big Empty anytime you want upon completion.
Sadly, no modern Fallout experience is complete without bugs. Almost every other time I stepped out into Big Mt.’s great outdoors, the game would slow to an agonizing crawl. There were also instances of visual disturbances, one account had flickering gray smudges obscuring my line of sight, another having the view tripped out repeatedly as if poisoned despite my stats registering as normal. There was also an amusing instance where horsenettle plants rained from the Sink’s ceiling, clipping into the floor and repeating.
Above all, Old World Blues is certainly a huge step up from Honest Hearts. Although its narrative barely holds a candle to Dead Money‘s, the escapade at Big Mt. should be regarded as the former’s significant other; bringing complete closure to the Sierra Madre experience and vice versa. The journey most certainly has its challenges, but the rewards more than compensate for the time spent enduring another one of the Old World’s forgotten nightmares. No doubt, this is one venture that any Mojave traveler shouldn’t go without. Let’s give it up for Science!tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-3265224172200387426.post2437931237841644412..comments2015-05-21T20:32:14.744-07:00Comments on From Head To Toe: Manicure Monday: Essie Naughty NauticalJen really like the color :-)love it! really like the color :-)love it!<br /><br /><br />thanks in advance!

Watching her mother go through a breast cancer diagnosis and treatment got Escobar to schedule the screening. But her sister-in-law, Patricia Tobon, reacted quite differently.
Tobon found a lump and ignored it. "She didn't tell anybody," remembers Escobar, who had been friends with her since childhood. "She didn't pay any attention to it for a long time. She thought it was nothing."
Tobon died at age 50, leaving behind two teenage sons.
"That is what motivates me to do my job," said Escobar, a community outreach worker at Moffitt Cancer Center. "I don't want other women to lose the battle against breast cancer just because they don't know what to do about it."
Escobar is part of a team at Moffitt that conducts breast cancer education programs for Hispanic women. The program, Yo Me Cuido ("I Take Care of Myself''), recently won praise from the White House, where Escobar was invited to accept an award.
Along with senior community outreach worker Jeannette Palencia, Escobar makes presentations in Spanish in homes, workplaces, churches, beauty salons, libraries, wherever they are invited. Their message is simple: Early detection saves lives.
One of the biggest challenges they face is changing the thinking of women who put everyone else in the family first.
"When we meet with groups we teach them, if you want to take care of your family, you must take care of yourself first so you can be healthy and be there for them," Palencia said.
Since 2011, Yo Me Cuido has reached more than 2,000 women in 10 counties.
But advocates know that much more needs to be done.
Groups like the American Cancer Society and Komen for the Cure have worked for years to increase breast cancer awareness. Especially in October, pink ribbons adorn everything from billboards and buses to NFL uniforms.
But there are still women who seem unaware of what they can do to prevent cancer or detect it early. The problem is particularly deadly for minority women.
Hispanic women historically have lower rates of breast cancer than do white, black and other minority women, according to the American Cancer Society. But breast cancer is still the leading cause of cancer death in Hispanic women, possibly because it is detected at a more advanced stage.
And while breast cancer rates among African-American women are lower than among white women, black women are 41 percent more likely to die of the disease. Lack of early detection may be contributing to this disparity, many experts think.
"That's why mammography screening is still so important for women in minority groups," said B. Lee Green, vice president for diversity at Moffitt Cancer Center and a senior member of the Health Outcomes and Behavior Program.
"What's happening with black women, in particular, is they are getting seen later, when the cancer is in a later stage, when the chances of survival tend to go down. That's why it's critically important to get them in for mammograms and to get them diagnosed early."
Women of all backgrounds are generally much more aware of mammography than they are of genetic testing for cancer risk. But again, the disparity is even greater among minorities.
"There's lots of room for improvement there," said Susan Vadaparampil, a researcher, behavioral scientist and associate member in the Health Outcomes and Behavior Program at Moffitt.
Black women are at increased risk for early-onset breast cancer — disease that strikes before age 50. "That's a big red flag that there might be something genetic going on and they may need to begin mammography screening earlier in life," said Vadaparampil. "Yet African-American and Hispanic women are less likely to know genetic testing is available and they're less likely to be referred for genetic testing by their health care providers."
Minority women are less likely than white women to participate in clinical trials, adding to the knowledge gap. Vadaparampil is involved in a statewide study recruiting black women 50 and younger who were diagnosed with invasive breast cancer between 2009 and 2012. As part of the study, they are offered genetic counseling and testing for BRCA1 and BRCA2 gene mutations.
"We want to learn about the impact of genetic counseling and testing in a group we traditionally don't know a whole lot about," said Vadaparampil, adding that 400 women already are in the study and 200 more are needed.
Carol Tim of St. Petersburg is part of a group that's working hard to improve African-American women's access to breast cancer detection and treatment. Tim, 52, is a two-time breast cancer survivor with a sister who also had the disease. She is active in the faith-based, nonprofit group Sistahs Surviving Breast Cancer. Members support one another, hold educational events, and speak to minority women's groups about the importance of mammograms, early detection, and genetic testing and counseling.
"I knew testing was available to me because I have insurance through work," she said. "But I know a lot of women who don't have insurance and don't know it's something they can do."
Tim was tested a few years ago at the suggestion of her Moffitt physician. "Because with me having breast cancer, my sister having it and because I have a daughter, I just needed to be proactive and find out if there is a gene so (my daughter) doesn't have to go through what we've gone through," she said.
One way that all women can protect themselves and their families, Green said, is to talk about relatives who have had cancer at reunions and other get-togethers.
"We have to have those conversations so we can share information with each other and with our (health care) providers,'' Green said. "Then they can make the best recommendations about screening, prevention and genetic testing."

The studio manager of Realtime Worlds has shed some light on their relationship with Crackdown 2 developer Ruffian, and offered their support for Crackdown 2.
Speaking in an in-depth interview with us recently Colin MacDonald said that they hoped for every success for Crackdown 2.
In the interview MacDonald explains quite candidly that the situation between Realtime Worlds and Ruffian over the Crackdown franchise resulted from Microsoft rather than anything else.
MacDonald said very honestly: "Both Crackdown 2 and APB are coming out soon and we hope that they're both a big success because Crackdown 2 being a big success is testament to all the work that we put in for the five years it too to make the original."
He added optimistically: "It's really a double whammy for us."

The Afirma Thyroid FNA Analysis combines expert cytopathology assessment of thyroid nodule fine needle aspiration samples, with the Afirma Gene Expression Classifier, a novel genomic test, used to resolve inconclusive results and thus help patients whose nodules are actually benign avoid unnecessary surgery. Two independent clinical studies to date have shown that the Afirma Gene Expression Classifier can reclassify patients with indeterminate thyroid FNA results as "benign" with the same degree of accuracy as a benign cytopathology diagnosis. by RTT Staff WriterFor comments and feedback: editorial@rttnews.comBusiness NewsOn this week’s Security Now!

KRAMER's match with RAGNAR cost him a loss of 9 points! Don't you think the Duelmaster is being unfair? I think ANNA BEATRICE should let BETTY?. It was kind of sad, seeing old ALF MUSHPIE stumbling around the arena, before BINGO LITTLE finished her off. Oh well! What a bunch of heartless! I couldn't believe how many people were snickering when LILY CATHERINE killed RANDELL SCOT. So he had a 3-9-0, that's no excuse!

I have started chiropractic treatment and have already seen a difference. I am feeling very optimistic about being back to "normal" soon!
on another note...
I spoke in Sacrament Meeting today, and am SO GLAD THAT'S OVER!
PHEW! what a relief.
It's so emotionally draining for me. I was part of a group of members in my ward who were asked to speak, and to take a new approach to how we give talks. We were asked to base our talks on a specific conference talk (we were each assigned one) but not to regurgitate the original talk. We all know that when a speaker is reading a lot, or quoting right and left, we tune out. We were asked to live the principle being taught (I had 2 weeks to prepare, others have longer - I was in the first group) and pray for inspiration to have experiences living that principle. Then they wanted us to share more personal experiences of that principle - and only use bits and pieces of the original talk by the general authority. I was super nervous. And on top of that, I was sure I was going to fall to pieces and cry and blubber the whole time because the personal experiences I chose to share were 2 very difficult times in my life. So, I practiced and practiced and cried and cried, and hoped that when the time came to actually present my talk at church, that all the tears would be cried out and I'd be fine. But, of course that didn't happen :)
I cried. a lot.
And so I've had a headache all day :( Blah!
But, I digress...
I wanted to share those experiences with finding peace during a trial here on my blog... in the hopes that someone else out there will be touched by what I have to say. However, I am not up to it tonight... still have puffy eyes and a headache... and well, let's be honest, it's past my bed time. :) yes, 9pm is generally when I start to shut down!
So, stay tuned for another blog post from me sometime this week...
love you all!
xoxo

I am a crybaby too- but the headache definitely sucks! I'm sure your talk was awesome. That sounds like a good way to have people prepare for a talk and have a meaningful experience in the process. Glad your treatment is helping!Today is Y Combinator Demo Day, and I’ve compiled a list of Y Combinator startups from the current batch who have officially launched (27 of 47) and ranked them using the same methodology as this month’s YC Index. It is extremely early days for these companies, this can give you a sense of who is getting attention and seeing early growth and we will use this as a benchmark for them in the index going forward. I will update this post as new companies are launched throughout the day.
The companies highlighted in orange would have made it into the top 100 of the Y Combinator Index released for March. All companies will be included in the April index.
I post this with the caveat that web traffic rarely tells the full story for any company. We have done our best to also factor in Facebook monthly active users and mobile app rankings, but for enterprise and developer tools companies the amount of website traffic they receive can be disproportionately low compared to how much money they make.
Update: Now includes PayTango, which launched last night.
Data sources include TechCrunch, Crunchbase, AngelList and YClist.

Markets. Thinks 2015 has had a positive beginning. The US has been hitting records every other day, but has been feeling a lot choppier than one would have thought, but he thinks this is normal. A lot of stocks are trading at higher elevated multiples, so you need to be more selective in this market. Things are getting better in the US with lower unemployment, etc. He fully expects a snap back and earnings will get better, especially with the retreat of the US$.
Energy. The recovery from the low $40 to the $60 was faster than what he had thought it would be. He had fully believed that we would reach $60 by the end of the year and we have done that already. We are starting to hear talk of US shale drillers coming back and spending more money now, now that they can hedge prices at the $60 level. Unfortunately, that will keep the oil range bound between $60 and $70 for the next couple of years, until the global demand really starts booming again.
1st quarter numbers were not as bad as the street expected, which is why we are seeing an upsurge. Seasonally they should be coming into a stronger quarter. They also expect to close some acquisitions. The issue he has is that it is still trading at too high a multiple. 44% of their earnings come out of Western Canada, mostly Alberta, and we are unlikely to see $100 oil in the next few years, so he thinks the pace of acquisitions has to slow down and they have to get more profit out of each store.
They basically supply line filters to a lot of products including the iPhone. Have done a couple of big acquisitions. Trading at 15X PE which is a good multiple in the space. They have a lot of room to run.
To get a lot of growth out of the banks, we need interest rates to go up. Unfortunately, even if the Fed starts raising rates, he believes it will be gradual, so the margins won’t be improving all that much. Meanwhile the domestic recovery in the US has been slower than everybody had expected. Hopefully we are reaching the end of the penalties and fines. This is one of the cheaper names, and when the economy does get rolling it will have a lot of torque. Still somewhat premature.
You can think of this as a mini Berkshire Hathaway. Focused primarily on asset management, tangible assets and have done very well as far as growing shareholder value and being opportunistic in getting to the areas. Not an easy company to analyse. If you own, continue to stick with it as you will do well over the long-term.
In a bit of a transition. They have been trying to market their C series more efficient jets. It is a better mouse trap, but they are up against stiff competition and are still struggling to get the C series going. Thinks the company will be okay, but will depend on the success of the C series.
One of his favourite oil names. Operating in Albania and Europe, so are exposed to Brent pricing. Have done a good job of controlling the resources and consolidating their operations and making more money out of every barrel they produce. At a $50 oil price, they pretty much can’t grow, but can still maintain production. Believes oil prices will gradually recover to $65-$70 by the end of the year and these guys will be able to restart their engine and grow again.
One of the most international banks in the Canadian group. They are in Mexico, South America, the Caribbean and a little bit in Asia. That should help them generate more growth than the pure Canadian banks. On the flipside, they also face some challenges in the jurisdictions. On the whole, he feels they provide a higher earning power and growth over the long-term. This is a core name that you should have in your portfolio.
The railway sector has done very, very well over the last 10 years. They are getting more market share from trucks, and the shipment of coal and oil has greatly benefited them. Right now they are in a bit of a tough spot given the stock has run up quite a bit and that coal is under threat from oversupply and oil shipments are down. Doesn’t expect there will be much growth this year. He would like to see it trading down more before he got interested.
One of the better asset based, especially on the SAGD oil side. Breakeven point is more like $65 rather than $80. Their issue earlier in the year was that they were over levered with the commitment to the capital expenditure. The big equity issue fixed that problem, so they have a good clear line to having this built. However, it is one of the more expensive names with the uncertainty that is going on in Alberta; the potential royalty review and potential emission charge increase.
The good thing is that the dollar store theme is not saturated yet in Canada. They are continuing to execute very well in their operations and opening new stores. Thinks there is still more upside through taking credit cards, better inventory management and better sourcing. Very high multiple, but if you own continue to hold.
This is modular furniture, mostly office and commercial at this stage. Have really good 3-D design software, so that not only can you visualize the design right away, you can go right to the manufacturing centre and get it made. Installation is relatively easy and everything is on time and on budget. There is a lot of upside expanding into other segments such as healthcare, hotels and even residential. Growing at 30%-40% a year and trading at a 20X multiple.
Have had big discoveries and able to grow their resources to well over 100 million pounds in the ground, and continue to find more discoveries. Eventually this will be a takeover target for one of the big guys. The only thing working against them is the uranium cycle. He firmly believes the price of uranium will come back.
A company that is well-run and pays a reasonably good dividend. Has a little bit of growth from their US acquisition. A solid name to have. Have the capacity to grow their earnings in the low to mid single digits. Thinks this and the preferred shares are a good 420 guests viewing this siteI’m tempted to speak as Aragorn did to Frodo at the Prancing Pony in Bree: “Are you frightened? Not nearly frightened enough.” And, humanly speaking, I think that Aragorn would have it precisely right.
Some of us have been trying to sound the alarm for a long time now. Government spending has expanded at a gobsmacking rate, and once-sustainable levels of deficit spending have exploded far beyond sustainable levels. And while the machinery of government has grown massive and over-fed, to where government employees are generally compensated far better than those in the private sector, Congress has passed one measure after another that makes life harder for the companies that power the private marketplace.
This is not a merely partisan complaint. Leaders in both parties have treated the private sector as a sort of bottomless piggy bank. The attitude appears to have been: feel free to impose more and more burdens, more and more restrictions and regulations, because surely the American economy can handle it. Who are they to be making such obscene and unfair profits, anyway? And yet, gradually, the gears of that economy began to slow, even as the spending commitments of our government have grown. It was clear where we were headed: a stagnant economy and a massive debt burden that would only grow worse as we confront the skyrocketing expenses of providing for Baby Boomers in their old age.
To make matters worse, it has not been clear that we have the cultural capital or the political will and resources to accomplish a dramatic change of trajectory. Can Americans become thrifty again? Can we become more industrious and creative again? Can we renew the virtues and values that provided the bedrock of the American free market? What about our representatives? Perhaps the most damaging legacy of the debt-ceiling debacle will be the decreased confidence amongst Americans and investors around the world in the American government, its ability to solve problems, and its commitment to getting its fiscal house in order.
And so yesterday Standard and Poor’s downgraded the credit rating of the American government to a AA+. It appears unlikely, they said, that we would regain a AAA rating for years to come, due to the ratio between our debt and our GDP.
This is a part of why our group of friends formed Christians for a Sustainable Economy. The political and economic practices of recent years are simply unsustainable. They will bear us toward catastrophe. This is not an exaggeration. In order to be wise stewards of our common resources as a nation, it is morally imperative that we decrease the debt and get our house in order. In the short term, I believe, the best thing (economically) we can do for the poor and for all Americans is promote job-growth. In the long term, the best thing we can do is bring our revenues and our spending, our taxes and our entitlement commitments, back into balance. Unless we are wise stewards now, unless we take responsibility and renew our commitment to sound economic values and practices, we are headed for terrible trouble.
Along these lines, I want to respond to something Michael Gerson wrote in the Washington Post today, referencing CASE. After agreeing with some of our points, he writes: first problem with this argument is that Gerson is actually quoting Jordan Sekulow, not the letter from CASE. So, to claim that “CASE” is “asserting” this is false (Mike is a friend, or at least a friendly acquaintance, so I assume it was a simple mistake; I’ve requested a correction and he said they’re looking into it). Further, the CASE Letter to the President says explicitly, “The government plays an important role, and communities do need the support of social safety nets for those in need.” So I find no daylight between the view we expressly hold and the view he criticizes us for failing to hold. But Gerson goes on to write:
The arguments of the Circle [of Protection].
To which I would make several points. First, the Circle of Protection seeks to protect not merely discretionary spending, but entitlement spending as well. So when we criticize their opposition to cuts, we are speaking not only of discretionary spending but also entitlements. And second, I wonder how people are feeling about the “urgency” of addressing our debt problem now that global markets are losing so much confidence in the American government that we lost a AAA credit rating we had held for 70 years?
It was never CASE’s main point that we needed to cut anti-poverty spending. We’re not out to gut programs that truly help people who are truly in need. Of course we’re not. It’s always been our main point that there is a fierce moral urgency not only to serving the poor right now, but to reducing the debt and wisely stewarding our budgets so that we can continue to serve the poor and serve all Americans well for the long term. To the extent that we raised concern over anti-poverty issues, it was to make the point that serving the poor and protecting the welfare state are not the same thing, and anyone who reduces the essence of Christian compassion to the Democratic social agenda is clearly not speaking for the whole “faith community.”
For a Christian like myself, there is ultimately another source of comfort and confidence in the face of all this fear. Yet we have legitimate reason for concern. We should all be concerned about the culture and the economy we’re handing over, or preparing to hand over, to our children and grandchildren. Right now, we are effectively stealing from our children to pay our bills. I don’t want my children to inherit a wasteland economy because my parents’ generation and my generation could not live within their means. That is a moral issue too.

The Green Wave, fielding a program for the first time since the 1989-90 season, won nine of the 11 events they participated in, including the 1650 free, 400 medley relay and 200 free relay. With the sweep of the UNT and UALR, Tulane improves to 5-1 overall on the year.
"We swam extremely well for the second consecutive meet," head coach Daniella Irle. "Our mile was awesome, our distance swimmers were on the ball, and our 400 individual medley was very good. This team may be comprised of an entire roster that has zero college experience, but they have shown the maturity of a much more veteran team. I can't say how pleased I am with each and every swimmer on this team."
Tulane was led by Linda McEachrane and Monica Jones as the freshman duo combined to help the Green Wave win five events. McEachrane won individual crowns in the 50 and 100 free with times of 24.61 and 54.43, respectively. Jones, meanwhile, won the 200 breast in 2:27.62 and the 200 butterfly with a time of 2:12.39, while teaming with McEachrane, Amanda Williams and Taylor Emerson to win the 400 medley relay in 4:04.31.
Other individual winners were Williams, Leslie Christian, and Nicole Taheri, while Taheri, Elizabeth Carey, Megan Underwood, Katie McGuire joined forces to win the 400 free relay in 1:42.71. Williams claimed the 400 individual medley in 4:39.17, Christian emerged victorious in the 500 free with a time of 5:12.00, and Taheri won the 1650 free in 17:36.90.

The bus driver escaped injury Thursday in the incident on Highway 114 near Texas Motor Speedway in Fort Worth.
Northwest Independent School District spokeswoman Emily Conklin says no students were aboard when the bus stopped at a red light.
Conklin says the driver reported that water came across the road, splashed into the bus and the vehicle was pushed to the side. The driver escaped through the rear door.
Mandatory evacuations began Thursday for about 150 homes in Wichita Falls near the rain-swollen Wichita River amid concerns over possible flooding.
The National Weather Service issued a flash flood watch for Wichita Falls until Memorial Day.FORT LEE — An 84-year-old Fort Lee man died Monday from injuries sustained in head-on crash on a one-way street, police said.
Jong G. Park was a passenger in a Hyundai Sonata driven by 71-year-old Jennifer Park when the car entered a one-way section of Inwood Terrace around 8:30 a.m., according to Fort Lee Chief Keith Bendul.
Another car, a BMW driven by 32-year-old Melissa Magyar, was headed northbound on Inwood as the Parks' Sonata came toward her in the wrong direction, the chief said.
The two cars collided head-on near 1149 Inwood Terrace.
Jong Park, who police said was not wearing a seatbelt, was rushed to Hackensack University Medical Center with "life-threatening injuries," Bendul said. He was pronounced dead at 9:18 a.m.
Jennifer Park was also taken to HUMC to be treated for injuries sustained in the crash. Magyar refused treatment at the scene but was later examined at Englewood Hospital. Both women were cooperating in the investigation, Bendul said, but no charges have yet been filed.
The accident is being investigated by the borough's Accident Investigation Unit and the Bergen County Prosecutor’s Office Fatal Accident Investigation Unit.
Cheif Bendul noted that the crash happened just three weeks after the state Division of Highway Traffic Safety’s "Click it or Ticket" campaign, and again emphasized the need for seatbelts.The two winners of the ECB Junior Journo competition that was organised in conjunction with The Times were present for the final of the Clydesdale Bank 40 competition on Saturday.

The.THE Somerset Rebels were crowned the Premier League Fours Champions for only the second time in their history on Sunday in a dramatic afternoon at Peterborough.
The Somerset quartet of Nick Morris, Olly Allen, Pontus Aspgren and Brady Kurtz, together with reserve Charles Wright, were drawn in Group A of the Championship Semi-Finals along with Newcastle, Scunthorpe and meeting hosts Peterborough, while the defending Fours Champions Edinburgh were in Group B together with Workington, Redcar and Berwick.
The Grand Final was to be contested over 12 heats with each rider having three rides each - Olly Allen get the Rebels off to a good start with second place in the opening heat, Pontus Aspgren following suite in heat two to put Somerset into a share of the lead at this early stage of proceedings.
Nick Morris sped away for the all-important race win, and with Workington’s Kyle Howarth only picking up a single point for third place, it meant that Somerset could not be caught, and were now the 2014 Premier League Fours Champions.
Somerset team manager Garry May said afterwards: “This was is just a fantastic achievement by the boys, when we put the team together over the winter I knew that we would be strong in events such as this and the Pairs, and so it has proved.
“All five of the boys rode their hearts out today, and were not going to be denied. “I knew that Nick and Olly wanted to make up for the disappointment of losing out in last month's Pairs Final, and they have done that in stunning style.
“In just under two years this club has won every team championship there is to win in the Premier League, which is some achievement, but we are not finished yet, we still have the League Championship itself to go for, we are the defending League Champions and we want to retain that title.”
“But all that is for later, right now we are going to enjoy the glory of being the Premier League Fours Champions, and hopefully all Somerset fans will be at the Oaktree Arena on Friday evening when we take on Rye Hose to give these boys the congratulations they richly deserve.”Dave Hill on London + Olympics & the media

Rancier
On 9 November 1827 Daniel
P. Smith of East Oswego, NY received $200 from Mason Bowen in a mortgage
agreement for one-third part of block no. 49. By 9 November 1831
Daniel P. had paid off this debt and the mortgage was cancelled.
On 9 June 1828 Daniel P. sold to James Sloan the northerly end section
of lot no. 12 in block no. 49 for $50.
Daniel P. Smith was first recorded
in Richland, Oswego co, NY on 6 June 1829 buying from Rudolph and Elizabeth
Bunner part of lot 102 for $95. This lot contained an estimated 100
acres. Most transactions at this time were not accurate as to acreage
as the surveyors had not yet come.
Daniel P. had come into Oswego County
from Vermont along with many others moving westward. Most pushed
on in their ox drawn wagons, but Daniel stayed. Where his funds had
come from is unclear. East Oswego did not suit him for whatever reason.
He preferred Richland possibly because he found a wife there. He
married Nancy Soule sometime during 1828 or ’29. She was the daughter
of Constant and Lucena (Brace) Soule, who came from Cambridge, Washington
Co., NY. Nancy was born ca. 1809 in Washington Co.
Daniel joined in the Richland community.
In 1830 he was made a pathmaster on beat 57. He was expected to keep
the road clear for passage of the public. The road system was primitive,
mostly a footpath begun by animals and worn in by Indians.
Daniel P. was a Baptist who was appointed
one of the first deacons of the Richland Baptist Church. He was considered
a man of business talents, so he was named to help the church buy land
for its building.
In 1854 Daniel P. and Nancy Smith sold
to Abner H. Waters lot no. 171 for $700. Many early land records
are missing. It is impossible to get a complete listing of all his
holdings. It is clear, however, that he considered himself a man
of some worth and he was determined to protect his property.
Nancy and Daniel P. had five children:
1. Stephen J. Smith b. Richland ca. 1829;
m. Fanny L. _____; d. 1892/1901. No issue.
2. George B. Smith b. Richland ca. 1832;
d.y.
3. Lucena J. Smith b. Richland ca. 1839;
m. (1) in Mexico, NY 10 April 1858 Theodore Henry Greene who died 8 December
1858; (2) June 1860 Samuel Clark Jeffery Greene of Mexico, NY who died
1917; d. February 1895. Issue: Theodore Ray Greene & Florence
Greene who d.y.
4. Jesse P. Smith b. Richland ca. 1842; m.
Marietta Benedict; d. before 1867. No issue.
5. Ezra G. Smith b. Richland ca. 1843; m.
Marietta (Benedict) (Smith) as her 2nd husband; d. after 1906. Issue:
G. Franklin Smith.
The 1850 census for Richland showed Daniel
P. at age 50, born in Vermont. There was only one Daniel P. Smith
recorded in the General Index to Vital Records born in 1800. This
child, born 31 May, was the son of Wyman and Mary (Polly) (Putnam) Smith
of Newberry, Orange Co., VT. To date there is no collaborating evidence
the Daniel P. of Newberry matches the Daniel P. of Richland nor can this
match be ruled out.
Sometime in the next decade Daniel
P. and family became residents of Mexico. The 1860 census put Daniel
P.’s birth in New Hampshire. This could be explained by the fact
that if Daniel P. received any last letters from his father, they would
have come from Piermont, NH where Wyman died in 1852 at age 82 selling
tombstones to the end.
On 29 October 1860 Daniel P. made his last
will and testament. It turned out to be a most remarkable document.
It controlled the lives of his wife and their children plus being in the
courts for over 40 years.
Daniel P. must have been ill and in fear
of approaching death. His will reflects his need to protect his sons
who all were minors, save one. He had the option to appoint his oldest
son, Stephen as Executor, but he didn’t. It suggests he trusted no
judgment save fully mature men. Samuel B. Larkin was named executor.
Further Larkin, John Becker, Jr. and Willis C. Johnson were made Trustees
“during the life of Nancy Smith, my wife and Stephen Smith, Jesse P, Smith
& Ezra G. Smith, my sons.”
Nancy was allowed to live on the farm the
rest of her life and her expenses were to be paid, but Nancy could “not
sell, mortgage, change or otherwise dispose” of the farm. The sons
and their wives/widows had the same restrictions put on them also.
“Issues and profits of said real and personal estate property
to Stephen Smith, Jesse P. Smith & Ezra G. Smith & their widows
… equally share and share alike during the lives of said sons and
the longest lives of them & their wives.”
It was all to pass to unborn heirs intact,
but if there was no issue then his daughter, Lucena Greene’s children could
share. He also gave $100 to Lucena outright. In case of any
legal action against the provisions of the will he appointed T. W. Skinner
of Mexico the Testamentary Guardian of his sons.
Daniel P. died 19 March 1861.
He was buried beneath a tombstone in the Willis Cemetery of South Richland.
His will was filed for probate on 27 March 1861. Samuel B. Larkin
was named Executor on 11 April 1861.
Daniel certainly felt the need to control
the lives of his children and widow even from the grave. The trustees
would dole out every cent. The widow Smith would have to specify
and sign receipts for everything.
Luckily for Lucena Green as a married woman
her father could not dictate her future. He meant the $100 bequest
to silence her forever. She thought the matter finished, no doubt.
In effect Daniel P. had willed his estate
to Samuel B. Larkin, John Becker, Jr. and Willis C. Johnson in trust to
be used according to the directions of the will. Executor Larkin
on 11 May 1864 settled his accounts with the court and was discharged as
executor. He remained a trustee.
All the documents amassed over 40 years are
still in the file of the Surrogate Court at the Oswego Court House.
These documents included dozens of small slips of papers containing the
signatures of each of the heirs. For example, Nancy wanted to buy
cloth for a winter coat. She wrote a specific request and then signed
for money to get the cloth and the thread. By the 1890’s the surviving
heirs were receiving $8 annually paid semi-annually. Each receipt
was handwritten and individually signed by the heir.
On 26 March 1864 Nancy signed the document
which helped to discharge the executor. She died sometime before
1867. She was probably buried in the Willis Cemetery, but there was
no stone purchased.
Many widows were treated as Nancy was, but
for competent adults to be so shackled was rare. Contemporary witnesses
indicated that the persons affected were fully intelligent and self-sufficient.
They did not need overseeing. As the sons reached adulthood, they
wanted to be free of the trustees. Again and again they went to court
without resolution.
Stephen married Fanny L. _____. He
died between 1892/1901. His widow died 1 December 1898. The
executor of her estate wrote to the court assuring that no legal action
would be undertaken against the Smith estate.
Ezra G. and his wife Marietta Smith had a
son, G. Franklin Smith born 4 October 1867. He was a medical doctor
whose picture appeared on p. 45 of the “Grip’s” volume on Mexico.
On 8 May 1895 he married Lida May Raymond. They had one child, Jesse
Carlyle Smith. Dr. Smith practiced in Mexico. His cousin, Theodore
Greene and his family were among his patients.
On 3 September 1901 Trustee Willis C. Johnson
wrote the court, reporting that Trustees Larkin and Becker were dead.
He wanted to be relieved of his duties as he was too ill to continue.
He indicated that Nancy Smith, Stephen J. Smith, Jesse P. Smith, Lucena
J. Greene and Stephen’s widow Fanny were all dead. He listed the
remaining heirs as: G. Franklin Smith, Fernwood, NY; Theodore R. Greene,
Mexico, NY; Ezra G. & Marietta Smith.
Ezra G. Smith wrote on 18 September 1901
to the court in response to the Willis letter. He drafted the letter
because he was the last surviving son of Daniel P. He agreed to the
resignation of Willis. He asked that G. Franklin Smith he appointed
trustee. All four heirs affixed their signatures.
G. Franklin was appointed to be the new trustee.
It was 1906 before he was able to petition the court to discharge the trust.
He listed the assets of the estate as they stood in 1906. The main
asset was a farm of 52 and a half acres in Mexico, NY. There also
was about $500 in cash. He argued that the trust was invalid because
it “was intended to continue during the lives of at least four persons
and possibly seven; clearly violating the law against the suspension of
the power of alienation.”
He asked that there be a distribution of
the assets of the estate. He wanted also to be discharged from his
duties as trustee.
On 12 November 1908 the estate was distributed.
Theodore R. Green received as his share of slightly over $800.
G. Franklin moved his family afterwards to
Georgetown, Delaware. He was hoping to find a better climate to improve
his health. Because of his poor health he had been forced to give
up his medical practice. His father died, but the date is unknown.
The family later went to the South Glastonbury, CT area. On 28 December
1928 G. Franklin died. He was buried in the Old Church Cemetery.
His wife, Lida died 14 June 1930 and was buried near him. On 2 April
1932 Marietta also died and was buried close by in the same cemetery.
Jesse Carlyle Smith died later without any
known issue. He was the last male heir of Daniel P. Smith.
Daniel P. probably would care little to learn that he has dozens of descendants
through his daughter, Lucena (Smith) Greene. To learn about Lucena’s line
also read the biographies of Jeffery Greene and his brother, Henry Knowles
Greene.

Return to the Oswego County homepagePresident Ma Ying-jeou (馬英九) has betrayed his pledge to divest the assets of the Chinese Nationalist Party (KMT), as a draft political party act passed by the Executive Yuan will not create a level playing field for all political parties, the pan-green camp said yesterday.
According to the draft approved by the Cabinet on Thursday, political parties must not operate or invest in profit-making enterprises and must transfer ownership of or sell off shares in such enterprises within two years of the legislation being enacted. If they failed to sell off the assets at the end of the two-year period, they would have to place them in a trust within six months.
The KMT took over the assets of the Japanese colonial government and countless private businesses and individuals when it fled China and took control of Taiwan after World War II, a move many of its detractors have described as outright theft.
The KMT pledged in 2005 to sell all of its assets, which have made it the richest political party in the world, its critics say. The party says it has placed most of its assets in a trust.
“The draft act is disappointing and is a strategy to legalize the status of the KMT’s assets, which have been placed in a trust and have been a disgrace to Taiwan,” DPP spokesperson Lin Chun-hsien (林俊憲) told a press conference yesterday.
Ma has never kept his promise to donate all profits from these assets in trust to charity and not to fund the party’s election campaigns with them, Lin said.
The evidence shows that Ma is a flat-out liar, Lin said, as the KMT earned NT$10.17 billion (US$340 million) from 2006 to last year, with half of the NT$440 million expenditure on Ma’s re-election campaign funded by KMT assets.
DPP Chairman Su Tseng-chang (蘇貞昌), who was touring Miaoli County, said: “Ma has tarnished his credibility and has betrayed his pledge [with the draft political party act] as the KMT’s unjust, ill-gotten assets have been a target of public anger.”
“The move to legalize the assets would arouse more public anger and disgust, and they will use the ballot to punish a party that thinks money can buy everything,” he said.
DPP Legislator Cheng Li-chiun (鄭麗君) said it was shame that Taiwan has yet to pass a political party act 25 years after the lifting of martial law.
However, the “money-laundering-like” draft act, which would ensure that the KMT continues to receive huge dividends, would not change the unbalanced playing field, she said.
She added that the DPP would do whatever it takes to monitor the screening of the act in the upcoming legislative session.
Taiwan Solidarity Union caucus whip Hsu Chung-hsin (許忠信) said the position of his party on the issue has been clear and firm.
“We insist that all the KMT’s ill-gotten assets, including properties, buildings, stocks and cash, should be returned to the national treasury,” Hsu said.Jane Lorinda (Thiede) Wolfe, age 71, passed away from pancreatic cancer at her home on Thursday, November 14, 2013. She was born on January 8, 1942 in Columbus, Wisconsin, the daughter of Harvey and Mable (Moe) Thiede.
During Jane’s school years she was active in 4-H and showed cattle with her sister Mary and brother Leon at the Columbia County and Wisconsin State Fairs.
She graduated from Columbus High School. She then worked at the Journal Republican in Columbus and IDO Feed Company in Fall River, Wisconsin. Jane married Charles Wolfe on December 5, 1970 in Columbus. Charles and Jane farmed on Charles’ grandfather’s century farm in York Township, Dane County. They raised three sons, Steven, Paul and Allen and one daughter, Janet. The Wolfe family raised hogs, which all of the children showed at the Dane County Fair. Jane continued to be actively involved with 4-H, acting as a leader for the York Town Toppers 4-H club, of which her children were all members. Jane was a great and dedicated wife to Charles and mother to her children and she enjoyed working on the farm.
Jane is survived by her husband Charles, three sons Steven, Paul, (friend Joann) and Allen. Daughter Janet, (husband Chris Sawyer), sister Mary Thiede, sister-in-law Joann Thiede, nephew Justin Thiede, and many other relatives. She was preceded in death by her parents and her brother Leon Thiede.
At Jane’s request, there will be no visitation and private graveside services will be held at Okeeg Cemetery in Danville, Dodge County, Wisconsin.
The family would like to thank the many neighbors, and the doctors and nurses at the University of Wisconsin Hospital and Agrace Hospice who assisted and cared for Jane. Memorials may be made to Agrace Hospice, Fitchburg, Wisconsin.(MENAFN - Arab News) Saudi arabia and the uae will cooperate to develop renewable energy and clean technology in the region.the decision which comes at a time of increasing interest in renewable across the region lays down a framework to jointly invest in clean energy projects and green technology investment funds. it will also create opportunities for collaboration on research and development of advanced clean energy technologies including solar wind and water.abu dhabi-owned masdar and the king abdullah city for atomic and renewable energy (kacare) signed an accord on monday to join together to advance the development of renewable energy and clean technology.hashim bin abdullah yamani president of kacare and sultan ahmed al-jaber chairman of masdar signed the agreement in the presence of general sheikh mohamed bin zayed al nahyan crown prince of abu dhabi and deputy supreme commander of the uae armed forces.sheikh mohamed bin zayed al nahyan hailed the pact and its important role in adding to the strong historic and strategic relationship between two countries."increased cooperation among gcc countries is crucial to advancing security stability and sustainable growth throughout the region" sheikh mohamed bin zayed added.through the agreement yamani said that the king abdullah city for atomic and renewable energy aims to diversify saudi arabia's energy sources."we are delighted to sign this agreement with masdar that has a proven track record and demonstrated credible achievements during the last eight years in this emerging sector. asUp from Etsy, and beyond the masks we paint with social media

The problem is, what’s possible on Facebook isn’t always within the network’s own rules, leading to your page being taken down overnight and all that hard work building a community is jeopardised. You can even get into legal trouble in the real world, risking substantial fines.
So let’s look at some of the ways you can find yourself inadvertently and reluctantly sitting on the social media sidelines with your Facebook page either deleted or disabled. The name of the game is Facebook Takedown! No business really wants to play Facebook takedown. For a start, one player has all the cards, not to mention the element of surprise and the final vote on who remains in the game and who doesn’t… .
Round 1
Your move: You decide to open a page using an alias to connect with a certain demographic of fans. “It’s just a bit of fun,” you think... .
Rules of the game: Facebook demands that you have to use real details, not fake ones.
Result: Facebook takedown!
Fellow ‘offenders’: Fans of cosplay – people who enjoy dressing up as fictional characters – discovered their pages had been removed without warning because they were using aliases. It doesn’t explain why God, Jesus Christ and Abraham Lincoln still have pages, except – unlike Marvel Comics or Disney – they are unlikely to sue Facebook for breach of copyright.
How you could have won: Make sure you use legitimate details. Fake or cartoon profile photos, email addresses that are suspicious, lack of photos or friend activity rings alarm bells with Facebook.
Round 2
Your move: You try to make friends and follow as many people and other businesses as possible.Rules of the game: Don’t be too enthusiastic, Facebook can view this kind of activity as spamming.
Result: Facebook takedown!
Fellow ‘offenders’: The very friendly David Fagin discovered too many friends is frowned upon when he sent out a raft of friend requests. His page was removed and he had to go through what he called a ‘humiliating ‘checklist’ of boxes, in which you’re forced to admit you’ve been a bad boy and promise not to do it again. He is now suing them for $1 over what he says was a libellous allegation as a matter of principle.
How you could have won: Have a clear strategy for growing your community rather than sending a friend request to everyone you’ve ever met. Let your ‘likes’ grow organically.
Round 3
Your move: You decide to put more content on your Facebook page.
Rules of the game: Facebook can arbitrarily decide you have breached someone’s copyright if they receive a complaint, even if that complaint is completely unsubstantiated.Result: Facebook takedown!
Fellow ‘offenders’: Earlier this year Facebook targeted a handful of tech bloggers for allegedly breaching copyright, despite not giving them any notification beforehand. The pages were subsequently restored.
How you could have won: Make sure you own all of your content or you have been granted permission to use it by the original author. That way you don’t risk Facebook’s wrath or court action by the creator of the work.
Round 4
Your move: You decide the cover photo on your business page should have a call to action and maybe even an offer.
Rules of the game: Facebook explicitly says no calls to action, no contact details, no offers, no promos, no advertisements and no coupons on your cover photo.
Result: Facebook takedown!
Fellow ‘offenders’: Just about every business and brand got this wrong when Facebook first released its business pages, including Corona, Volvo and Armani.
How you could have won: Use an image that sums up what your brand stands for, not what it sells.
Round 5
Your move: You run a promotion or competition on your site asking for ‘likes’ or ‘shares’ to enter. The winner will be announced in a Facebook post.
Rules of the game: Facebook is clear that competitions and promotions cannot be run through the platform or using any of its functionality. You must use a third party app for any comps or promos, such as Wildfire.
Result: Facebook takedown, plus an extra penalty card – you’ve just broken various state laws about running competitions. You may not go straight to jail, but you do risk fines.
Fellow ‘offenders’: Take a little while looking through business or brand pages and you will find plenty of other offenders, all of them risking an overnight removal of their pages, or worse.
How you could have won: Read the Facebook rules, and ask for expert legal help in establishing terms and conditions for your competitions. Once you have them, you can be confident you are not contravening any laws going forward.The only thing that comes close to the joy of a Red Sox win is a Yankee loss. And thanks to Mariano Rivera and his epic meltdown, we got one. The Yankees had a 6-5 lead going to the bottom of the ninth. Enter the Sandman. In his 675 save opportunities, Rivera has converted 603 of them. Most teams get to this point in the game and just wait for the fabled cutter to f%&k them over. Not the 2012 Rays. Check out the play-by-play:
Notice how every ball that was hit has that word “deep” in it? Not a good sign for Rivera and the Yankees. We’ve been saying for how many years he is going to get old? Looks like it might finally happen.These Are the Moments February 8, 2009 Posted in My Girl,My Girl 2.0 I never had a sister. I am glad that these two will never have to say that. « Because Both Kids Are Napping And I’d Rather Not Be Productive Hungry Mondays, Week 15: I Am Getting Tired of Keeping It Real » 12 comments share with a friend Hillary - They are both adorable and lucky girls to have each other. Jennifer W. - That last photo is AWESOME. Avelyn looks like she is secretly plotting something not too nice. Jolie looks like she is giving you the silent stare of fear. “Mama.look.at.her.” [nod, nod]. They are too cute. LVGurl - That is my mantra with Makenna, when her little sister isn’t high on her list. “Mommy never had a sister. She didn’t have a brother either. She grew up all alone. It is very special to have a sister.” I repeat. IT IS VERY SPECIAL TO HAVE A SISTER. They look quite happy with one another, although Avelyn is keeping her eye on that little one (last picture!) Christina - AWW!!! They’re so lucky, not to mention adorable! I didn’t have a sister either. Just 3 rotten to the core brothers. Jen - Very sweet. Sisters are the best. :) shelley - Avelyn looks particularly mischievous in that last photo! Hmmm.. Michele - Awww!!! They’re so sweet! Angella - They are going to be so thankful for each other. Jolie’s expression in that second-last photo cracks me up. joyce - sisters are the best! i love mine! your girls are beautiful. love Jolie’s little curls. angie - They’re so cute! I think they’ll look just alike when they’re bigger. metalia - Aww! So sweet. The second to last is my favorite. (And Ella has EXACTLY the same hair as Jolie.) Sarah - Ooh, they’re just. so. cute!! Sisters are so much fun; I hope your girls grow up to love each other as much as my sisters and I do. I’m sure they will =)If you were to log in, you'd be able to get more information on your fellow community member. Custome...Pittsburgh's captain is making a mad dash up the scoring ladder. He put up 6 goals and 3 assists in a four-day stretch last week, capped by a hat trick and an assist in Saturday's 4-1 victory against New Jersey.
Crosby had just 3 goals in Pittsburgh's first 14 games, perhaps inspiring Semin, then the NHL scoring leader, to make his comments. But Crosby has lit the light 10 times in his last nine games..
Five up -- Five players who've been hot:
Evgeni Malkin -- Crosby's teammate had a pretty good week of his own. He had a natural hat trick and an assist Wednesday and a pair of assists in each of Pittsburgh's next two games to take a five-point lead in the scoring race.
Mikko Koivu -- The younger Koivu brother is well on the way to his best offensive season since joining the NHL in 2005. Koivu had 3 goals and 3 assists in Minnesota's four games last week and is 8-16-24 in the Wild's first 22 games.
Alex Ovechkin -- Despite being blanked in Washington's 3-0 loss to Columbus on Saturday, Ovechkin remains on a tear. He has 5 goals in his last four games -- including three Wednesday in Atlanta -- had 22 points in 10 games before the loss to the Blue Jackets, and is up to 30 points despite missing two games while visiting his ailing grandfather in Russia.
Rob Blake -- The 38-year-old defenseman is showing there's still plenty of life in his game. He has 3 goals and 4 assists in San Jose's last four games, all victories. He now has 5 goals and 20 points in 24 games.
Jonas Hiller -- Anaheim's No. 2 goaltender is playing better than most No. 1s. He's allowed just two goals while winning his last three starts and is 6-1-1 this season, with a 1.94 goals-against average.
Five down -- Five players who are struggling:
Fabian Brunnstrom -- Brunnstrom had a hat trick in his NHL debut, but has gone cold over the past few weeks. He has no points in his last nine games and has taken just 11 shots on goal in that span.
Todd Bertuzzi -- The former All-Star's early-season scoring touch (5 goals in his first five games) has vanished. Bertuzzi has gone 12 games without a goal and has just 2 assists in Calgary's last seven games.
Erik Christensen -- The Thrashers hoped they were getting a productive second- or third-line center when they acquired Christensen from Pittsburgh last February, but so far this season, he's done little. The 24-year-old has 1 goal and 7 assists in 20 games; he's pointless in his last four and was a healthy scratch Friday and Sunday.
Wade Redden -- The Rangers' big free-agent blue line acquisition isn't producing offensively the way he was expected. Redden has no points and is a minus-3 in New York's last four games and was 0-6-6 with a minus-6 rating in November.
Injuries, news and notes -- He never was a big offensive force, but Luke Richardson gave an honest night's work in every one of the 1,417 NHL games he played over 21 seasons with six teams, ending with his hometown Ottawa Senators. He cleared waivers and retired Sunday, but hopes to remain in the organization in some capacity.
Returning -- San Jose's No. 1 goaltender, Evgeni Nabokov, returned Wednesday after missing nearly three weeks with a lower-body injury. He's gone since his return. … Philadelphia hopes to have center Daniel Briere, who's missed nine games with a groin injury, back in the lineup this week, possibly as early as Tuesday. … St. Louis forward Patrik Berglund returned Saturday after missing four games with a groin injury. … Detroit forward Dan Cleary came back Friday after missing nearly three weeks with a scratched cornea. … Florida defenseman Nick Boynton returned Friday against the New York Rangers after missing a couple of games with a concussion. … Washington hopes to get its best offensive defenseman, Mike Green, back on the ice for Tuesday's game. He's missed almost two weeks with a shoulder injury. … Islanders center Nate Thompson returned Friday after missing nine games with a groin injury. The Islanders also hope to get center Mike Sillinger back as early as Thursday; he has played three American Hockey League games in a rehab stint but hasn't played in the NHL since undergoing hip surgery last February. … Ottawa center Mike Fisher returned from a knee injury Thursday and scored a goal in his first game back.
The week ahead -- December starts with another busy week. Eight teams have four games; only Boston, New Jersey, the Islanders and Ottawa play just two. Montreal plays games 2, 3 and 4 of a seven-game homestand, the longest in franchise history.
Games to watch:
Toronto at San Jose (Dec. 2) -- Former San Jose coach Ron Wilson makes his return to the Shark Tank as the bench boss of the Maple Leafs. Winning there won't be easy -- the Sharks are 12-0-1 at home under Todd McLellan, who replaced Wilson.
New York Rangers at Montreal (Dec. 4, 7 p.m. ET, CBC, RDS) -- On the night of the Canadiens' 99th anniversary, they continue the celebration of their centennial season with the debut of Centennial Plaza and Centennial Jersey Night (1915-16), while meeting the Rangers for the first time this season.
Vancouver at Detroit (Dec. 4) -- The Canucks and Red Wings meet for the fourth and final time this season. Vancouver has won two of first the three games, both in overtime, including a 4-3 win in its previous visit to Detroit on Oct. 16.
Pittsburgh at Ottawa (Dec. 6, 2 p.m. ET, CBC) -- The Penguins and Senators meet for the first time since they opened the season with a pair of games in Stockholm.
Washington at Carolina (Dec. 7) -- The Caps make their second visit of the season to RBC Center. Washington has dominated its Southeast Division rival, beating the Hurricanes in their last four meetings, including two this season.
Tough week ahead:
Atlanta Thrashers -- There's no home cooking for the Thrashers, who visit Montreal, Ottawa and Long Island in a five-day stretch that begins Tuesday at Bell Centre.
Toronto Maple Leafs -- It's time for a little California Dreamin' for the Leafs, who visit Los Angeles on Monday, San Jose on Tuesday and then head for Phoenix on Thursday. Then they return home to face the Capitals on Saturday.
Vancouver Canucks -- Vancouver continues a seven-game trip by heading east for four games, including a three-in-four swing through Detroit, Minnesota and Colorado beginning Thursday night.
Easy week ahead:
New York Islanders -- After six games in nine nights, the Isles get to catch their breath with a four-day break before playing at Washington on Thursday and home against Atlanta two nights later.
Ottawa Senators -- The Senators continue a stretch in which they have a lot of down time. They get three days off before hosting Atlanta on Wednesday, and then have a two-day break before Pittsburgh comes to town Saturday.
San Jose Sharks -- The NHL's best home team (12-0-1) gets to spend the week at the Shark Tank against three teams (Toronto, Columbus, Edmonton) that are light years behind them in the standings.Search by

Tropical Valley Foods Alert on Undeclared Allergens
The Missouri Department of Health and Senior Services received information regarding the recall alert of Tropical Valley Foods products due to a labeling.
###Tettau
[1] : Königlich privilegierte Porzellanmanufaktur Tettau, Schmidt & Greiner (1794 until 1852):
This well known factory started after the German naturalist Alexander von Humbold had put in a good word for the would-be founders during meetings with the Prussian King Friedrich Wilhelm II and so Johann Friedrich Paul Schmidt from Coburg and the brothers Wilhelm Heinrich Immanuel Greiner and Georg Christian Friedmann Greiner from Kloster Veilsdorf on December 28th 1794 finally received the required permission. The first Bavarian porcelain factory at first concentrated on normal household items as well as coffee, tea and cocoa sets but soon also started to create complete dinner settings. Even if the original permit was only valid for fifteen years, it was later transformed into an unlimited permission due to the success of the factory which greatly pleased the King. During the later years, Wilhelm Heinrich Immanuel Greiner's son Balthasar was also involved, however he did not share the same interest in the factory and then decided to sell it.
[2] : Königlich privilegierte Porzellanmanufaktur Tettau, Ferdinand Klaus (1852 until 1866)
In 1852 Ferdinand Klaus took over the company and continued to use the same markings. He also kept the product range and only made minor changes in decoration style; the further decorators employed increased the workforce to around 70 people.
[3] : Königlich privilegierte Porzellanmanufaktur Tettau, Sontag & Birkner (1866 until 1879)
Only fourteens years later, the company was sold again, this time to Wilhelm Sontag and Karl Birkner.
[4] : Königlich privilegierte Porzellanmanufaktur Tettau, Sontag & Maisel (1879 until 1902)
After Birkner retired from business his place was taken by the investor and businessman Ludwig Maisel. In 1897 a large blaze completely destroyed the factory and based on the very promising business forecast the owners instantly started to rebuild the factory, only much larger this time. Following the successful restart of operations, Maisel decided to retire and his former partner was joined by his sons.
[5] : Königlich privilegierte Porzellanmanufaktur Tettau, Sontag & Söhne (1902 until 1915)
Sontag's sons were very active and next to running the business in Tettau they also opened a decoration studio in the Thuringian town of Geiersthal where they next to other items mainly decorated goods made by the Fraureuth Porzellan company. During the next years the factory was constantly modernized and prospered, leading to the transformation into a corporation in the year 1915.
[6] : Porzellanmanufaktur Tettau A.G. (1915 until 1958)
Since around 1913 the very successful business had specialized on restaurantware and hotel porcelain as well as special sets for children; its very wide product range was exported worldwide. Only from around 1930 did the factory actually produce large numbers of items decorated in 'Strohblume' (strawflower) and 'Zwiebelmuster' (Blue Onion) styles. Until around 1937 the factory only employed around 250 workers and that number is a great example of how modern and well structured the factory was; in comparison other companies at the same time employed far more people and created less output per year. This success did not go unnoticed and the company had for some time caught the attention of the Christian Seltmann company.
[7] : Königlich privilegierte Porzellanmanufaktur Tettau G.m.b.H. (1958 until ...)
The owner of the ⇒Porzellanfabrik Christian Seltmann G.m.b.H. in Weiden Wilhelm Seltmann became main shareholder of the factory in 1957 and shortly afterwards took over completely, integrating it into the family-owned Seltmann Weiden group after transforming the Tettau factory into a limited liability company

This is every system I own. After playing for 30 years and never selling anything ever, you can bet I've accumulated quite a bit of stuff.
This is every system I own. After playing for 30 years and never selling anything ever, you can bet I've accumulated quite a bit of stuff.
My first ever system. I still have it, and it still works. The controllers were designed to give you carpal tunnel. Lady Bug holds a special place in my heart as my Pac-Man clone of choice.
I didn't actually purchase an Atari until much much later, and my model is an Atari Jr., so there's no wood paneling.
I picked up one of these off of eBay back in 2002 and proceeded to collect pretty much every game there is for it. A neighbor owned one when I was very young, and scoring this bad boy was a desire to relive old memories. It's awesome, and it still works!
If you tallied up the amount of time in hours I've spent playing my NES vs. the amount of hours I've spent sleeping in my lifetime, the numbers would probably be very close.
Tetris, nuff said.
I was a Nintendo guy, so I didn't get my Genesis until much later in life, and only so I could get a Sega CD. I've never been a big Genesis fan, but Toejam & Earl is still one of my cult classics.
It's not an amazing system but there are some clear winners. The original Splatterhouse, Legendary Axe, Bonk's Adventure all come to mind immediately.
My Golden Age machine. Final Fantasy 3 came out when I was 16, and Chrono Trigger came out when I was 17. I still feel the SNES is the pinnacle of true video game artistry.
I'm a huge Lunar fan. So when I found a copy sitting around in a secondhand shop, there was really only one option.
My Playstation got a lot of RPG use as I trucked through college. This was my first Adult Life system, and just in time for the ESRB to start cracking down.
Sometimes you've just got to play Radiant Silvergun.
I basically got this specifically for Phantasy Star Online. I know a lot of people hold the Dreamcast in very high regards, however I still consider it one of the three worst consoles of all time. Feel free to disagree.
I've got an original model and an SP. It's incredible how much better this system is with a backlit screen. It's a travesty that it took Nintendo 12 years to figure it out.
One of my favorite systems. I've got about 300 games for my PS2, some of which I've probably never even played. I've even got an original model PS2 that still works perfectly - reads CDs, DVDs, you name it. It's pure luck, mind you, as it's logged hundreds of hours of playtime.
I like the Gamecube, but chances are if I could buy it on my PS2 instead, I did.
The DS sucked, and then was great, and is now beginning to suck again. I've never flip-flopped on a system as much as I have with the DS. I still enjoy it from time to time.
Bought one on launch day. In the past 5 years I have logged maybe 50 hours total playtime, with 45 of those hours likely playing Lumines or Gitaroo-Man.
This was my first Microsoft system, and they really had to win me over, as I was (and still am) a fervent naysayer of the original XBox. But Microsoft won me over.
I bought it, and after a few months, gave it to my mother. I just don't do gimmicks well.
I got a free copy of inFamous, so I purchased a PS3 so I could play it. Since then the reasons to continue playing the PS3 have grown incrementally. I don't see any reason anymore to diss the console.Things to see and do - Guadix

More is needed, however, to make a difference in Washington, DC.
Facebook/TEDMED
WASHINGTON, DC - Perched on the banks of the Potomac River, the TEDMED gathering weighed in last week on what it considered the greatest challenges facing healthcare.
A meeting closely associated with the high tech-optimism of Silicon Valley and other outposts of America's innovator class, TEDMED came east this year from it's previous home in San Diego. The idea was to bring the gathering's ethos and its troupe of entrepreneurs, thinkers, futurists, doers, and artists to our nation's political capital.
It's unclear whether Washington was listening during the three and half-day day assembly, since much of the establishment here was away on Easter-Passover break. But National Institutes of Health Director Francis Collins gave a talk. And so did Commissioner of the Food & Drug Administration Margaret Hamburg, along with a few other Washington types, even if they mostly didn't stay and mix in the usual TED fashion.
Still, the 1700 attendees did engage in an activity that Washington understands - an election.
The delegates - many of whom paid $5,000 to be there - voted for one of 50 "Great Challenges" facing healthcare that they believed was most worthy of attention. They were joined by thousands of non-attendees following the meeting for free on simulcasts and on the organization's website.
Sponsored by the nonprofit Robert Wood Johnson Foundation and the TEDMED organization, the challenges included The Obesity Crisis, Eliminating Medical Errors, End-of-Life Care, Impact of Poverty on Health, and Medical Information Overload.
The list included some perennial Washington obsessions such as Addressing Health Care Costs, but did not include other DC favorites such as the solvency of Medicare and Medicaid and the future of Obamacare.
The soft-pedaling of politically touchy issues was in line with the wishes of the new curator of TEDMED, Jay Walker, who decided that the meeting would avoid contentious content during its first outing in DC. An inventor and the founder most famously of Priceline, Walker's company, Walker Digital, acquired TEDMED last year.
Not everyone in the TEDMED community agreed, given that this is a political town and issues can be discussed without taking sides. Personally, I believe that a TED meets Washington airing of issues could be exciting. Walker, however, wanted to stay with the tradition of TED, which stands for Technology Entertainment & Design - but not politics.
Each of the 50 challenges at TEDMED were represented by an "advocate" - entrepreneurs, physicians, hospital executives, patient representatives, and others. At the last minute, probably late at night, a challenge #51 was added to the list - Sleep Deprivation - hardly a shock at a meeting of over-achievers.
Some of the advocates campaigned hard for their challenge, donning buttons and t-shirts and passing out cards and flyers.
For instance, one morning on a bus taking me to the meeting place at Kennedy Center, a personable young physician named Rajiv Kumar thrust out his hand and a card encouraging me to vote for his challenge - Inventing Wellness Programs that Work.
"70 percent of Americans don't exercise regularly," he explained, telling me he had co-founded a company in 2006 called ShapeUp. Based in Rhode Island, Kumar's business company is using data and the latest Health 2.0 tools to help other companies incentivize their employees to be more fit, to improve health and to save money.
In another nod to Washington, a few advocates enlisted the deeper pockets of well-healed sponsors such as the Cleveland Clinic. Their Chief Experience Officer, physician James Merlino, campaigned for Improving Medical Communication. His flyer quoted George Bernard Shaw: "The single biggest problem in communication is the illusion that it has taken place."
And now, the envelope please.
The winner was: Inventing Wellness Programs that Work - Rajiv Kumar's challenge. This candidate brought in a staggering 10% of the vote, twice the percentage of the second place winner, which was The Caregiver Crisis, polling at 5%.
Third place was a tie, with Role of the Patient polling the same as The Obesity Crisis, each getting 4% of the vote.
Fourth place was a seven-way tie at 3% each, which included Improving Medical Communication - the campaign assisted by the Cleveland Clinic.
The top 20 winners will become the focus of projects over the next year.
Some challenges that didn't make the top-20 cut were Isolation and Loneliness, Special Needs Patients, Unwed Teen Motherhood, Reducing School Violence, and Malpractice Dilemma.
If there is a take-away from this election, it's that this self-selected group of forward-looking people believes that healthcare reform should focus much more on keeping people healthy and engaged in their own healthcare.
This is not surprising among these highly motivated self-starters, who include an outsized number of people who are vegetarians, yoga practitioners and techies. Yet I wonder if a greater challenge is how to translate this sensibility to the non-TEDMED-minded, such as those 70% of Americans that Rajiv Kumar said barely exercise or the 535 members of the House and Senate working up the hill from Foggy Bottom, where the meeting was held.
I'd also encourage a stronger push by Jay Walker and the TEDMED community to truly engage with Washington and the powers that be. This would mean converting the talk about innovation - combined with the powerful confidence of a culture that fervently believes they can fix things, and sometimes succeeds - to a real process of re-energizing health reform.
Washington certainly could use an entrepreneurial reset of fresh ideas from beyond the Potomac and its slow-moving waters. Perhaps this is the intent of Walker and company - to tiptoe into town this year to establish a presence, and then next year to pounce.Model 705 Microphone Low Output Mod
From the Ten-Tec Reflector December 22, 2000
The reason you are having low output from your TT 705 desk microphone is due to a design flaw in its bias circuit.
The Primo EM-60 ( EM-100 in the 1201 kit ) electret cartridge used in the 705 requires 1.5 volts DC minimum to bias the JFET inside the electret well into the constant current region. Actually, 3 to 4 volts is much better.
The existing TT design has way too much resistance (24K) in line with the electret such that it's bias voltage never rises much above .5 ~.6 volts DC; and the JFET never gets out of the constant resistance region, and consequently cannot develop adequate gain.
To fix your 705 mic, tack solder a 3300 ohm resistor across R11 ( which is 22K now ).
You will find that you will have plenty of output after this mod .
If you are interested in enhancing the low end freq response as well, increase C2 to .47 uf or larger.
Also you should verify that the 705 is being run on at least 7 volts by measuring its operating voltage at the M+ pad on the 705's printed circuit board. Some older Corsairs have 10K behind the mic connector pin 4, which should be reduced to less than 68 ohms.

On sprint days, for example, doing a few pseudo-sprints at 75-85% effort make for a fantastic warmup. For a workout involving squats, lunges, and hip extension, a minute or two of static Grok squatting lets my hips!
Thank you, Mark, I was sure this was what the Groc hang would be, but nice to have it confirmed.
Since my bar isn’t tall enough to allow a toe graze, probably about a 15-20s hang sound about right?
Yes, that’s about right, art. Grok on!
Mark,
Can you be too heavy for this? ie 300 pounds?
Sorry, I’m not Mark, but I think it might be a bit too much at first, at least if you aren’t used to doing pull-ups. If you can do pull-ups at 300lbs. a)you’re a beast! and b)maybe your shoulders can take it.
Maybe try it with your feet on the ground and your knees bent, and just let the bar take some of your weight, and see how it feels?
Awesome-I will do this at CF today before I get started on my too long warm up 😉
Thanks for the article! I always enjoy reading your blogs they are so well written and sometimes even comical!
happy wednesday!
manda
I hang near the stairs at my gf<s house when no one is around! haha hopefully her parents wont see me! hahah
Mark, what’s your take on stretching post workout?
Hey Mark-
Long time, no comment!
I’ve been a big fan of the grok hang for years. I think it helps those who sit a lot, and generally provide some “resistance” to gravity in a way by stretching the spine out.
One thing I do have to disagree with you on though: “Workouts should be effortless”. Unless you’re some chic in the gym who is afraid of sweating or the guy who takes 5-10 minutes between sets, workouts should NOT be effortless. There is nothing effortless about all-out sprints or cross fit!
Continue the grokkage,
Ryan Denner
I think he meant to say they shouldn’t be a mental “chore” they should be fun, not easy because a plank is definitely not easy, nor are the sprints but they can be fun. My wife and I do sprints on trails in a park, she flees as fast as she can, I give her 5 seconds head start then sprint after her and slap her on the butt when I catch her. We’re both laughing and giggling and getting a very thorough workout by the end. Ideal, effortless.
Thanks John, great response. I get it now… especially the butt smacking! It is a splendid idea that I need to implement into my relationship.
Mark, this further proves that readers of your blog are truly smart!
Mark, how should a person’s shoulder blades be positioned during this stretch – retracted (I picture this with chest pushed out) or “relaxed”, or does it matter?
This is perfect for us who are not so tall :D. I like to swing now & then on the pull up bar above the door frame & this is great timming lol. I have to jump up to get hold of the bar to begin with. I’m going to enjoy this move. Thanks.
Well this was timely! I’m a CrossFit dabbler, and yesterdays WOD put the hurt on the ol’ pecs…
Very cool. I was looking for a couple functional stretching exercises to add to my routine. This fits the bill perfectly.
The Oranguhang
Nice!
I just want to say that in general, I REALLY appreciate Mark linking to study citations so often. It never hurts to have backup and it has helped me sell my family on PB. 😀
As you suggest in the Primal Blueprint I engage in 2 stretches and nothing else… The grok squat and grok hang.
I recently attended the CrossFit Movement Mobilty cert given by Kelly Starrett. Check this out.
Great article. I’m glad I’m not the only one just hanging around for part of my warmup.
I have pruchased a Teeter’s Hangup inversion table due to bad back…herniated disk, etc…will let all of you know how it works once I get the thing unpacked and have used it. Nothing else has worked for me. Fingers crossed that this will!
I too have just purchased a Teeter’s Hangup!!! I am trying to figure out how to assemble it. Please let me know what you think!!
How are you doing with the inversion table, did your condition improve?
I do the hang but with my feet on the ground … full extension makes my elbow tendonitis flare up and then I can’t use my arms for three weeks. I do the hang before pullup/chinup workouts (no full extension there either, more like 3/4 extension) and also during the workouts, feels good to stretch a bit after a few sets.
mark, a few questions/comments have been posted about inversion hanging – what’s your take: good or bad?
Is there reason to be concerned that doing these two stretches pre-workout might inhibit muscular performance, especially in the lats, glutes, and quads?
Thanks for the idea! I’m not fond of warm-ups either. I realise they are necessary to preventing injury but I feel like I’m wasting my time a little when all I really want to do is get into the workout I’ve designed for the day :).
Ditto to what Jenny said. Having links to cited articles helps out a lot. As you encourage us to do, I check out (some of) the links to be able to form my own opinions on the information presented :).
Keep up the great work!
I HAVE AN INVERSION TABLE AND I REALLY LOVE IT. IT TOOK ME MONTHS TO ASSEMBLE IT BECAUSE I LOOKED AT THE PARTS AND LET IT SIT FOR AWHILE IN THE GARAGE BUT ONCE I DECIDED TO PUT IT TOGETHER IT WSA NOT SO HARD. IT’S A GREAT MACHINE.
I learned that trick from a Dan Millman book years ago. It’s one of the few things from Millman that stuck with me, and probably one of the most valuable he had to teach.
I’ve been experimenting with hanging upside-down from a pull-up bar/ tree: a lot cheaper than an inversion table and more fun! When I wasn’t injured (trapped nerve in the hip area, caused by spinal injury), I could link hanging into a fun, gymnastic-style workout, now it’s just for stretching I’m afraid!
You say hang we’ll hang, you say hunt we’ll hunt Mark!
Let’s not confuse ‘athletics’ and ‘exercise’ either. Those involved in sport and the ‘sport of fitness’, i.e., CrossFit, warm-ups are instrumental in getting one’s engine warmed up for competition, if not injury prevention. Try doing “Fran” or “Annie” without a 5 or 10 minute warm-up, and I bet your performance will suffer. But I guess the point of this post is for the benefit of Primal Blueprint folks. Grok on!
I do this almost every day I work out. Just really loosens everything up–shoulders, arms, spine, hips. Makes me feel better, which makes my workout better.
“Our warm up is your workout” 😀
Yikes. That’s backwards. It’s “Your workout is our warm up”
“Your workout is our warm up.” Such a vast overstatement on so many levels. *sigh*
Regardless, I’m not so sure that this is a good idea as a WARMUP exercise, but rather a post-workout exercise. The hanging can really tire some people out and affect their ability at pull-ups.
I often do not perform the hang as a warm up because of the stretch on the lats (as I say below) – it feels a little tough on cold muscles sometimes…
I always feel the Grok hang stretch out my back and lats – its great to improve grip strength too!
As far as functional muscles go, I think too many people focus on their beach muscles (i.e. chest and biceps), ignoring the importance of forearm strength. You never know when you may be hanging on for your life…ok well a bit far fetched but I think grip strength is useful in every day life (e.g. carrying many shopping bags always burns the forearms!)
Rock climbers are a great example of a sport that requires functional strength and has the nice result of a toned upper body.
I have been doing this for a couple of years, keeps my lower back pain in check, additionally I move my hips to the left and to the right while hanging, really loosens the hip bone.
I do the Grok hang sometimes as well as an altered version with my toes on the floor because my pull-up bar is only a little bit higher than my head. If you have a bar or can find a branch about head height, keep your toes on the floor back as far as possible and “hang” while leaning forward to get a similar stretch in the arms and shoulders and also slightly in the chest and abdomen.-

Council strikes down surcharge on permits for beefy homes
Bigger might not necessarily be better when it comes to the size of a home. But it won't cost any extra when you pay for a permit to build one in San Juan County.
The County Council on Tuesday reversed an earlier decision and eliminated a so-called surcharge on building permits for homes of more than 3,500 square feet. That surcharge would also have applied to an addition of an existing home that bumped its size beyond that 3,500-square-foot mark.
The surcharge had been slated to take effect at the beginning of the year, but remained in limbo following advice from the prosecuting attorney that a surcharge based solely on size would be on shaky legal ground.
The surcharge had been approved by the council late last year when the 2009 budget was adopted, along with an overall 5 percent increase on building and land-use permits. It had been slated to take effect at the beginning of the year, but remained in limbo on the advice from the prosecuting attorney that a surcharge based solely on size would be on shaky legal ground.
The council also struck down an additional $100 fee on shoreline development permits, which was intended to pay for the inspection of waterfront projects once they had been completed. That fee also had been approved by the council late last year.
Objections about the surcharge were raised by the San Juan Builders Association shortly after it was approved. John Evans of Orcas Island, director of the association and a former county commissioner, insisted that it violated state law in that amounts to an extra fee with no relation to any standard or criteria normally used by the county in determining the price of a permit.
In response, Prosecuting Attorney Randy Gaylord advised the council that the association's objections had merit. Gaylord said if it were contested in court that the burden of proof would fall on the county to demonstrate that the surcharge had been set by following its standard "cost allocation" equation.
The surcharge would have added roughly $800 onto a permit for a $1 million home and, had it been in effect in 2008, applied to about a dozen permits — roughly 9 percent of the total number of applications the county received a year ago.

Today Amex EveryDay Credit Card was designed with the multi-tasker in mind, like busy moms juggling family, work and their personal lives. The Card rewards Card Members at the places they already shop, and includes access to the retail protection, security and service expected from American Express. Liebowitz.
"Our goal is to be a more inclusive and welcoming brand by building new products for different lifestyles and spending needs, backed by the service and quality that has made American Express so successful," said Josh Silverman, president, Consumer Products & Services, American Express. "The average American uses their credit or debit card twice a day, and shops most within 20 minutes of their home," added Silverman. "So we designed a card that doesn't require you to change your daily ritual – but rewards you for where you already shop."
Earn Rewards Quickly, Use Rewards Easily with the Amex EveryDay Credit Card:
- Earn 2x Membership Rewards points at U.S. supermarkets, on up to $6,000 per year on purchases (then 1x); and 1x points on all other purchases.(3)
- Use the Card to make 20 or more purchases in a billing period and earn 20% extra points on all those purchases less returns and credits. Terms and limitations apply.
- A digital counter in the Amex Mobile app helps keep track of each qualifying purchase for the bonus, so Card Members always know when they're close to earning 20% extra Membership Rewards points.
- Redeem points for a variety of rewards, including using them towards recent charges with Use Points for Charges(4), redeeming for gift cards or merchandise, using them towards purchases at Amazon.com and Ticketmaster and booking travel at amextravel.com, or transferring them for miles in the frequent flyer programs of 17 different airlines..
(1) 20% Extra Points Benefit
How the Benefit Works
If you make 20 or more separate purchases of goods or services in a billing period with your Amex EveryDay(SM) Credit Card ("Card"), you earn 20% extra Membership Rewards points on those purchases less returns and credits with a date in that billing period. A transaction where you buy multiple items counts as one purchase. Purchases do not include fees or interest charges, balance transfers, cash advances, purchases of travelers checks, purchases or reloading of prepaid cards, or purchases of other cash equivalents.
This benefit will not apply to any limited time promotions and offers (such as a Welcome Bonus).
Impact of Returns and Credits
Returns and credits do not reduce your purchase count. Returns and credits will reduce the number of Membership Rewards points and extra Membership Rewards points earned.
Example: Suppose in a billing period you make 20 purchases totaling $500 and you return a $200 item that you purchased in the same or a prior billing period. The return does not reduce your purchase count, but it does reduce the Membership Rewards points on those purchases from 500 to 300. So, in this example you would earn 20% extra on those 300 points.
When Purchases Count
To count purchases for this benefit, we use the date of the purchase. For example, if you make a purchase on the last day in your January billing period, it might not post to your account until your February billing period. If this happens, the purchase still counts towards your January billing period. In rare instances, a purchase may not post to your account for several billing periods. For example, extreme weather or other business disruptions may delay a merchant in submitting transactions to us. If a purchase posts to your account more than four billing periods after the purchase date, we count it for the billing period in which it posts, and not the purchase date.
Some merchants combine separate charges into a single transaction before submitting it to us. When this happens, the combined transaction will count as a single purchase for purposes of counting towards 20 separate purchases. For example, if you charge three items to your Card at the same online merchant at three separate times over one or more days, the merchant may combine those three charges and submit them as a single transaction. In that case, that combined transaction will count as one purchase.
Transaction Dates
A date of a purchase, return or credit may sometimes be different from the date you made the transaction. For example, if you buy goods online, the purchase date may be the date the goods are shipped. Also, if you use your Card while traveling (on a hotel, car rental, or while on a cruise), the purchase date may be the date you complete that travel.

Just saw Star Trek into Darkness. Pretty good. Cumberbatch was outstanding. The story was either somewhat derivative or an homage to STII.
The unfortunate things about these franchise movies is that there is no real suspense to them. You know despite what happens to the main characters in the movie, they are not really in any mortal peril because there's going to be a sequel - or a sequel to the sequel. No matter how good the movie is - storywise or with the special effects - it loses some drama because you know the good guys are going to survive and win in the end.

Star Trek with a new ship and crew has been done, and done, and done (TNG, DS9, Voyager, Enterprise). It's great to have a reboot with the core characters, and to immediately shake things up in a huge way. BTW - the reboot is from 2009, so the statute of limitations on spoilers has run out.
I really loved the ST: Into Darkness. Amazing movie. The stakes kept going up and up, and the plot kept growing and branching out until it was almost too thick. It was a great action movie with a good balance of characters and a perfect number of winks to the past.

Christchurch Earthquake
New Zealand Minister for Building and Construction, Hon Maurice Williamson, visited China 23-29 October. During his visit he discussed the Christchurch earthquake in September and New Zealand's earthquake proofing and management systems with Chinese counterpart Minister Jiang Weixin of the Ministry of Housing, Urban-Rural Development.

Big earthquake in New Zealand: “Zero Deaths” is the result of how many years’ efforts?
How do 4 million New Zealanders view the “miracle” in the eyes of 1.3 billion Chinese?
By Peng Liguo, Southern Weekend (Nanfang Zhoumo), 16 Sep
Is this just a matter of luck?
“Staying in a one-or-two-floor residential building is much safer than running out.”
It was 4:36 in the early morning in New Zealand on 4 Sept. Sun Siwei, a freshman of the Engineering College of the University of Canterbury, was preparing for examinations overnight. Without any warning signs, the 7.1 magnitude seismic wave travelled from the small town of Darfield and struck the city of Christchurch, the second largest New Zealand city and provincial capital of Canterbury where he lives.
At seven o’clock in the morning, he decided to go out and look around. His neighbour, 80-something year old Mr Baker was taking care of his garden. In a nearby park, housewives were joking about how many vases were broken. He was confused: did an earthquake happen at all?
The earthquake did happen. This is the most destructive earthquake to hit New Zealand in 70 years. For Canterbury, there has hardly been one at all in the past hundred years.
But it was as if the earthquake didn’t happen. At midday, Prime Minister John Key declared to the world, “it’s a miracle that nobody was killed.” With only two serious injuries, the impact was even less serious than a traffic accident.
The “less serious than a traffic accident” miracle shocked the world, which had not yet recovered from the painful memories of Wenchuan, Haiti Port-au-Prince, and Chile amongst others. New Zealand made the top headline of global newspapers the next day.
While experts from all countries are trying hard to deduce the reason behind the zero casualties, some New Zealanders think it was just a matter of good luck. “I’m sorry but we really don’t have any ‘secret weapon’, much as we would like to. All we had was good luck,” Sara from New Zealand GeoNet website calmly told Southern Weekend.
The good luck she mentioned was the timing of the earthquake, which happened in the early morning when everyone was asleep. “If it happened during the day time when everyone was outdoors, there would probably have been more casualties, particularly due to masonry falling onto the sidewalk.” Mrs Smith of Darfield also said that, according to normal routines, some people would have been in the clubs and bars if the earthquake had hit two hours earlier. If it had occurred two hours later, then some people would have been outdoors. “In that case, it would have been a different story.” This was an earthquake which hit without warning. “The Canterbury plain is covered by gravel and thus we don’t see any trace of fault activity”, making it difficult to predict this earthquake,” said an expert on a New Zealand geological website.
Although most New Zealanders are given good emergency preparedness education, this earthquake did not allow them time for practice. From the perspective of Chinese-New Zealand earthquake engineer Ma Junming, the timing meant people were sleeping and did not have time to get out of their rooms at all, “Staying in a one-or-two-floor residential building is much safer than running out.”
“A zero death toll is a miracle. But we regard it as a well-prepared miracle,” said Ma Junming.
The cabin floating like lotus leaf
“Earthquakes don’t kill people. Bad buildings do.” “It is true that the outcome in New Zealand was no surprise.” As an earthquake engineer who does not have any religious beliefs, Chairman to Risk Solutions International (RSI) Peter Yanev explained the “miracle” from his perspective: “If my memory serves correctly, most New Zealanders live in light wooden structural houses that can withstand intensive earthquakes, just as we do here in California.” Will you be safe in your own little wooden house when an earthquake strikes? Undoubtedly, this conclusion almost embarrasses all scientific emergency measures.
Ms. Alexandra’s house stayed safe and sound in Christchurch’s CBD, 41 kilometres away from the epicentre; Sun Siwei’s house stayed safe and sound 25 kilometres from the epicentre; and Mr and Mrs Smith’s house also stayed safe and sound in Darfield, 3 kilometres from the epicentre. Those houses, like almost all residential buildings in Christchurch, are “light wooden structures”, which stand only one-or-two-floors high with masonry materials used for outer wall decoration or the rooftop chimney only. Such wooden houses do not fall down during earthquakes, even if the outer walls collapse. With a population density equivalent to only 1/9 of that in China, New Zealand has enough space for its citizens to reside in independent-standing cabins: “88% of civilian buildings in New Zealand are of wooden structures,” said Ma Junming.
Besides the wooden framework, there is another secret beneath the houses, called “base-isolating bearings” by earthquake engineers. Ms. Ivy, a dress designer living in Christchurch, said her house was not directly tied to the foundation, but had a huge isolator placed in between. When the earthquake hit, she felt as though her house was on a lotus leaf. “No matter how hard the water under it was boiling, the lotus leaf only moved slightly.” None of those cabins “floating” on the seismic wave had their outer walls fall or chimneys collapse completely.
Professor Andy Buchanan with the Department of Civil and Natural Resources Engineering at the University of Canterbury told Southern Weekend that these structurally light wooden houses were carefully designed to comply with the earthquake resistance standards set by earthquake engineers. “No civilian buildings collapsed, so that people who slept inside did not die.” “Earthquakes don’t kill people, but bad buildings do.” This faithful motto of New Zealand’s circle of earthquake engineering was fully exemplified in the earthquake.
How big is the earthquake problem?
“The earthquake problem in New Zealand is only a problem of scientific interest, not a problem to be watched out for.”
It has, however, taken New Zealanders more than one hundred years to travel along the tough road to reach the “floating cabins”. Earthquakes frequently hit the country located on the junction of the Pacific Plate and the Australian Plate. More than 15,000 earthquakes are located and recorded every year in New Zealand by GeoNet scientists. Since 1960, the country has experienced twenty-one earthquakes measuring above 7.0-magnitude. Each of them has been a reminder of the big one.
The earliest reminder was the Martinborough earthquake in 1848. Newly-settled European migrants suffered disastrous losses in the 7.5-magnitude earthquake, the earliest one on record, with almost all masonry collapsing. Many people built wooden houses during the reconstruction period. These wooden buildings suffered the least damage while newly-built masonry suffered a repeat tragedy when a 8.2-magnitude earthquake, the biggest ever in New Zealand, hit Wairarapa in 1855. The residents of a young Wellington city learned from the two reminders that they had to obey the laws of this island if they wanted to settle down. Wooden structural houses began to dominate for the first time. Therefore, Professor Buchanan from University of Canterbury viewed 1855 as the turning point when New Zealand started to take earthquake-resistant construction seriously.
Merely twenty-five or thirty years later, people’s awareness of construction safety slipped. Encouraged by the government’s Defence Act, masonry that could stave off fire debuted again. Fortunately no major earthquake was experienced in the first thirty years of the 20th century, and thus the comments in the New Zealand Official Yearbook from 1913 to 1926: “the earthquake problem in New Zealand is only a problem of scientific interest, not a problem to be watched out for.” Forgetting the past led to immediate punishment. In 1931, a 7.8-magnitude earthquake ravaged the whole Hawke's Bay area including Napier, again knocking down massive pieces of masonry. This devastating quake caused at least 256 deaths, most of which were caused by collapsing buildings.
After that, a construction committee carefully investigated the causes behind the housing collapses and introduced a guide to building, which was considered to be the embryonic form of New Zealand’s Building Code. The Building Code, officially legislated in 1935, requires even masonry to be firmly reinforced.
Amendments were made to the Act four times from 1965 to 1992, but no regulation was made regarding construction materials or structure of residential houses in the law even under the new Building Act 2004. “Unless classified as historical heritage sites, residential buildings do not face much mandatory regulations of law,” said Ma Junming. Nowadays light wooden structures are chosen by New Zealanders by their own free will.
Controversy over “National Building Specifications”
“The reason is very simple: it can save the people’s lives.”
In fact, New Zealand is not a medieval country filled with two-story wooden houses. Skyscrapers stand row upon row as well as a lot of old, heavy masonry which meet national regulations and building standards. In 2004, the Department of Building and Housing adopted the Building Act 2004, which set the most-detailed-ever standards for defining the earthquake-prone buildings. This Act authorises local government to assess every building higher than two floors or comprised of more than three residential units. Buildings cannot be occupied anymore without reinforced measures or demolition once classified as unable to withstand moderate earthquakes.
Actually, many authorised local authorities went further beyond this Act. “Existing buildings must be strengthened to 34% of the capacity of a comparable new building, yet the percentage was raised to 50% by many local governments” said Ma Junming.
Although praised by earthquake engineer experts as “a big step forward”, this Act aroused controversy since the very beginning of its implementation. As it applies to new masonry and reinforced concrete buildings and also old buildings classified as “historical heritage” before 1976, almost all the buildings in New Zealand had to be reconstructed or reinforced, except for small wooden residential buildings, according to the Act. Such a huge project could not be funded by government subsidies alone. Strengthening or rebuilding was no small cost to property owners.
But laws are made to be followed. The assessment and strengthening work moved forward despite difficulties. Consultant teams composed of earthquake engineering experts from the University of Auckland and the University of Canterbury rushed worked on old or newer buildings. All the buildings, no matter owned by the poor or the rich, no matter whether they were located in the urban or suburban, were upgraded to meet the “National Building Specifications (NBS)”. The 4 September earthquake, the most devastating earthquake in 70 years, has been the best test for the Act and these efforts.
A team of experts including Professor Buchanan has started assessment of damage to buildings since the earthquake. They discovered that most of the collapsed buildings were built before the 1970s and not yet been reinforced. “Many old buildings reinforced to 2/3 of the NBS were not ruined. And new buildings combined with reinforced concrete and steel frame did not really suffer any damaged at all,” Charles Clifton, expert on reinforced concrete, told Southern Weekend.
Christchurch Mayor Bob Parker announced a change in building policy on 10 Sept, requiring the 960 existing earthquake-prone buildings to undergo strengthening to 67 percent of NBS levels, rather than 33 percent as was previously the requirement. He suggested that this higher standard be applied immediately.
The target was the same as set in Gisborne after its 6.8-Magnitude earthquake in 2007. The Mayor of Gisborne, Meng Foon, a Chinese descendant, told Southern Weekly. “This earthquake proved once again that the new building code is reliable. The reason is very simple: it can save the people’s lives.”
“Professional without corruption”
The zero death toll in the Christchurch earthquake is “an ode to professional engineers”.
The Christchurch Cathedral, a landmark of Christchurch city, is more than a hundred years old and was strengthened by professional engineers. After the earthquake struck, all the Christchurch people wanted to know how it had stood up to the shock. The old cathedral made it.
This miracle would not have happened without professional engineers observing the Building Act. For Buchanan, the zero death toll in Christchurch earthquake was “an ode to professional engineers”. Peter Yanev praised highly his Kiwi colleagues: “New Zealand has the most brilliant earthquake engineering experts in the world. Their performance is particularly remarkable considering the general population. Many top earthquake engineers in California have migrated from New Zealand in the past fifty years. Thanks to their help, California has become safer.”
New Zealand earthquake engineers well deserve such praise. “New Zealand is the first country that designed a reinforced concrete building so that it would not fall in an earthquake. This seismic scheme called ‘Capacity Design’ has been used worldwide. New Zealand is also the first country that developed and applied a seismic isolation system. This technology can put a building on special base isolating bearings to avoid structural destruction,” said Andrew Charleson, an expert on buildings from the University of Victoria, Wellington.
There are far more facts to list. Well-known inventions in the global earthquake engineering community including “ductility design” and “lead-rubber base-isolating bearing” are all invented by New Zealand earthquake engineers. The latest update is that the “Displacement-Based Seismic Design” invented by Professor Nigel Priestley with the New Zealand Society for Earthquake Engineering may become the big news in earthquake engineer design. This design has been put into use in Europe and New Zealand.
All of these inventions ensured that historical treasures such as the Christchurch Cathedral can survive earthquakes. What’s more, they are not only applied in Kiwis’ homes, many of them have also taken hold worldwide as national standards.
However, Buchanan thinks having skilful and professional engineers in themselves is not enough. New Zealand’s good luck is largely attributed to a huge number of honest construction companies and construction monitoring supervisors working beside those engineers. “Of course the building code is important. But what’s more important, is a high degree of professionalism without corruption,” said Buchanan. This seems to be another “secret weapon”As of 8 pst.

Judiciary panel members debated Wednesday on the measure restricting recognition of the identification.
Republican bill sponsor Rep. George Cleveland of Jacksonville says the ID information is not reliable and fakes are used by illegal immigrants. The bill would make it illegal to use the card or similar ones from other countries for state residency to get a driver's license, obtain auto insurance or enroll in Medicaid. Police could not use them to determine identity.
Opponents say the Mexican card now has many safeguards to ensure reliable information.

Airport insecurity
Dear Editor: Marilyn Jean Hartman made it past security at Mineta San Jose International Airport on Monday night and was arrested after arriving at Los Angeles International Airport. This is like a Seinfeld episode, where Uncle Leo was stealing and claimed, "I'm an old man."
This old white woman did it more than once and maybe she's genuinely seeking attention. Maybe she's lonely and wanted to be famous. I've been through airport security and they'll check your underwear. So how Marilyn Hartman got past security puzzles me. Do old white women blend in so well that it's hard to spot someone who looks out of place while boarding a plane? Is airport security too busy looking for men with turbans and seatbelt explosives connected to their beards?
Come on, airport security, what's going on here? All those Federal Aviation Administration rules slipping through the cracks?
I'm glad that Marylin Hartman could fly for free more than once because it shows that our airport security is not that secure. It also shows that white women won't call this racial profiling. It's just a mistake, after all. We're human, even the airport insecurity.

Depression
Dear Editor: Robin Williams' death is a symbol to all in this country. A symbol that when it comes to mental health and mental health-related issues, we are losing the battle for better care and outcomes. Every year, many lives are needlessly lost due to suicide stemming from mental health problems like depression. It has finally come to a point where mental health and mental illness is taken out of the closet and discussed on a national level. In this way, there is a realization that there is hope and recovery for everyone. Hopefully, this discussion will happen sooner than later so nobody else will lose their lives and the human value they possessed.

May 27, 2010 7 comments
Researchers in the US and UK have confirmed that a short-lived isotope of tin is the latest member in an exclusive club of "doubly magic" nuclei, a nuclear equivalent to the noble gases. This is only the seventh of these rigidly spherical nuclei to have its magical qualities measured. And the experiment could provide clues to how heavy elements are created in the supernova explosions of massive stars.
Physicists have long known that protons and neutrons in nuclei occupy discrete orbital shells – in much the same way as electrons do in atoms. Indeed, when this idea was developed into the "nuclear shell model" it won Maria Goeppert-Mayer and J Hans D Jensen a share of the 1963 Nobel Prize for Physics.
Magic nuclei are those having the precise number of protons or neutrons required to fill each orbital shell to full capacity. Nuclei with magic neutron or proton numbers tend to be characterized by a stronger binding, greater stability, and are, therefore, more abundant in nature. In doubly magic nuclei, both proton and neutron shells are filled, which can make the binding even stronger.
Double the magic
To date, researchers have discovered just six doubly magic nuclei by confirming the spherical nature of their outer shells. Five of these – including helium-4 and oxygen-16 – are among the most common isotopes found in nature on account of their stability. But in 1998 researchers discovered the latest doubly magic nucleus, nickel-56, which is much less stable. It has a half life of 5.9 days on account of it having two neutrons fewer than nickel-58, which is far more abundant in nature.
People thought this wouldn't be possible until the next generation of facilities come along Kate Jones, the University of Tennessee
Now, a group of researchers at the Oak Ridge National Laboratory in Tennessee have confirmed the existence of a seventh doubly magic nucleus, which is far more unstable still. Tin-132, with its 50 protons and 82 neutrons, was predicted to be doubly magic by the nuclear shell model but it has been very difficult to prove this because it decays with a half life of just 40 seconds.
To get around this, Kate Jones of the University of Tennessee has led a novel experiment, which turned standard procedures on their head. One favoured approach to identifying doubly magic nuclei is to strip neutrons from the target isotope and infer the structure of the doubly magic nucleus from properties of these dislodged neutrons. This can be done by creating a film of the target material and hitting it with a beam of deuterium, which is an isotope of hydrogen comprising one proton and one neutron.
Aggressor becomes the target
However, given that tin-132 is too short-lived to produce a substantial film, Jones' team decided to switch the target with the firing beam. Using Oak Ridge's Holifield Radiation Isotope Beam Facility (HRIBF), they accelerate a beam of tin-132 to a velocity of about 10% the speed of light and direct this at a target of polyethalene that has been deuterated: its hydrogen-1 atoms replaced with hydrogen-2. As the tin-132 isotopes collide with the target some of them could split the deuterium molecules by stripping a neutrons to form the heavier nuclei of tin-133, while the proton fell back towards the target.
The clever part is that the researchers can study the motion of these recoiling protons to reveal information about the structure of the tin nuclei. By analysing properties such as energy and angular distribution of these particles, the researchers could confirm that the stripped neutron rests in a separate orbital above the closed inner structure of the tin-132. The fact that the neutron falls into this "single particle state" is confirmation that tin-132 must have the robustly spherical nature reminiscent of a doubly magic nucleus.
Jones says that it is the "purity" of the single particle states that makes these results so convincing. "People thought this wouldn't be possible until the next generation of facilities come along, but we are really excited to have managed it using our cyclotron accelerator whose design dates back to the 1950s."
Short-lived nuclear landscape
Rituparna Kanungo, an experimental nuclear physicist at St Mary's University in Halifax, Canada, is impressed by the inverse kinematics technique employed by the Holifield team. "This is a powerful but quite challenging experimental tool to study single-particle states," she says. "These observations are important for developing the nuclear shell model in regions of the nuclear landscape where isotopes start to become short-lived."
One fascinating area of physics that may benefit from this field of research is the study of how heavier elements are formed in highly explosive conditions. More than half of the elements heavier than iron are believed to originate from something known as the "R process", which involves a succession of rapid neutron captures on seed nuclei, typically nickel-56. "The main contender for the site of production is supernova or neutron star mergers, but given the explosive nature of these sites it is very difficult to reproduce this process in the laboratory," says Jones.
This research is published in Nature.

Six of the charter services will operate non-stop from Nagoya into Christchurch, with the remainder flying into Auckland.
The charter programme, which is additional to Air New Zealand’s regular scheduled services from Tokyo and Osaka, is expected to bring up to 3200 additional Japanese tourists into New Zealand over the peak summer months.
Air New Zealand General Manager Japan Ed Overy says the significant increase in charter services this summer reflects the strong growth in demand from the Japan region.
“This is our fourth year of charter operations. We continue to be very encouraged by the appetite for destination New Zealand from regional Japan and are especially pleased to be offering charters from new destinations within Japan this year.
“Last summer we operated seven charters from Japan - four from Nagoya, two from Fukuoka and one from Kagoshima. This year we’ve doubled that number and will be adding services from Hiroshima, Takamatsu and Shizuoka.”
Mr Overy said the airline had worked in partnership with Auckland International Airport Ltd and Christchurch International Airport Ltd in putting together this year’s programme.
“We are excited to this year be operating services directly into Christchurch, as well as to Auckland. Christchurch is a hugely appealing destination for Japanese visitors and we anticipate these charter services will be a welcome boost to South Island tourism over summer.”
The 14 charter services are on top of a 20% increase in capacity over the same time last year from Tokyo, with the airline operating six services a week from Tokyo in November and daily services from December along with three services per week from Osaka.
“As New Zealand’s fifth-largest source of tourists, Japan continues to be a hugely important market for us and one we firmly believe offers New Zealand enormous opportunity. We’ve spoken publicly about our goal to return to daily services to Tokyo as demand from Japan returns. This move to daily services from December further illustrates our long-term belief in and commitment to this important market.”
Christchurch International Airport (CIAL) Chief Executive Jim Boult says the charter services are sure to be well supported by Japanese travellers.
“Most international travellers come to New Zealand for our awesome mountains and lakes, so they love flying into Christchurch over the Southern Alps,” he says. “The South Island is a ‘must’ in any Japanese travel itinerary and we look forward to working with Air New Zealand to bring more Japanese visitors here.”
The charter programme begins with a service from Hiroshima into Auckland on 19 December and concludes with a service between Shizuoka and Auckland on 20 March 2013.
All services will be operated by Air New Zealand’s Boeing 767-300ER aircraft, which accommodate 230 passengers..SCOTT WALKER WINS!

Only about 50% in, but Walker likely to win....
You libs only believe in "democracy" and "the voice of the people" when you win. When you lose big, you cry about "money". As if the Dems didn't get any out-of-state money.
This from the party whose candidate was planning to raise ONE BILLION DOLLARS for his Presidential campaign, and GLOATING about it.

Of course FOX is declaring a Walker Win already lolololol

Dear Soldier,
Summer finally arrived - nearly everyone is out of school, even in districts with weird calendars. The weather heated up - we are at 93f here in Salt Lake City today. I know it is much hotter where you are in Iraq.
I took a short trip to Iowa during the floods - the trip was planned several months ago. I took my two small children to see my parents in central Iowa, and it was pretty exciting. My kids experienced their first tornado warning: one was sighted 4 miles west of Dad & Char's place. My 5 year old slept through it as I carried her downstairs, and back up. My 6 year old was rather excited and a little scared. The thunderstorms were very powerful - lots of lightning and tons of rain. We had a one-hour detour around Des Moines to get back to the airport.
It is so weird to be back where I grew up - I look at a piece of furniture and I feel 5 years old. My dad was criticizing my kids' hair, and I just thought "oh, you haven't changed in the last 30 years, have you dad?"
Politics are pretty hot too - the two major parties have their nominees. Congress is trying to finish up some big stuff before a short break. The Supreme Court is releasing decisions too.
The NBA has their draft in a couple days, I think. It is usually around my birthday anyway. The Kansas City Royals actually beat the Colorado Rockies in inter-league play, but other than that, they are having another sucky season. It is really hard to be a Kansas City Royal fan. I tried to stop, but it didn't work. They have been my favorite team for over 35 years! Since they were a new franchise and I was a small girl.
It is about time to scare up some supper. I think I will make stir-fry and salad. It's not quite too hot to cook ;-) Later tonight I will bake a loaf or two of bread, after it cools off. I also have hopes of going to knit with some girlfriends - I know, I have a wildly exciting life.
Thank you for all you do for our country, and for my family.

The Mayor of London was joined by his Hillingdon counterpart, Cllr Michael Markham.
The open play library has more than 2,000 books, seven PCs and four Apple Mac computers.
There is also a Starbucks coffee shop, a florist and free wi-fi.
Council leader Ray Puddifoot said: “This is the latest of our new libraries and is a fantastic facility for South Ruislip residents.
“We believe we are the only local authority in the country either rebuilding or refurbishing every one of our libraries.”
The library is open from 9.30am-9pm Monday-Thursday, 9.30am-5.30 Fridays and 9.30am-4pm on Saturdays.Sensitive fish: The blast of cold air that moved through our region late last week put an abrupt end to springlike conditions that anglers had enjoyed for several weeks. In the North Suncoast area, water temperatures plummeted almost overnight. That sudden shock sent temperature-sensitive fish such as snook and pompano running for warmer water.
Snook fishing: Before the cold fronts, passage snook had begun to show up outside the rivers and canals. Most of them were 18 to 26 inches. They were found gathered along leeward shorelines where the bottom was dark and there was direct sunlight.
But as long as the water stays cold, these fish will likely disappear until things get warm. Very cold water can stun and even kill snook, and they usually return to deep inland water as soon as water temperatures begin to fall out of their comfort range.
When the temperatures warm and they move out again, stealthy sight casting with live shrimp using very light leaders and small hooks will produce strikes if an angler is patient and repeatedly crawls a shrimp through the area with snook. It's common to get a bite on a 10th cast to the same fish.
Pompano: Pompano and small permit from miles of grassflats near Tarpon Springs typically seek the shelter of the Anclote power plant when cold sets in. Early reports have been good as the fish begin to appear in the outflow channel. The lure of choice for most pompano pros is a small yellow jig, tipped with a small piece of shrimp and bounced rapidly along the bottom.

There is no obvious reason for such behavior. Let's consider we have the following simple schema: create table a (a_idx bigint, data int); alter table a add constraint a_pkey primary key(a_idx); create table b (b_idx bigint, a_idx bigint); alter table b add constraint "$1" foreign key (a_idx) references a(a_idx); insert into a values (1, NULL); Now, let's start two parallel connections to the DB, say in two shell windows: ---- Session 1 begins ---- BEGIN; insert into b values (1, 1); ---- Session 1 stays idle ---- ---- Session 2 begins ---- update a set data=5; ---- Session 2 blocks ---- As you can see at the end the UPDATE in session 2 is blocked until transaction in session 1 either commits or rolls back. However, as I said there is no reason for this blockage since update in the session 2 doesn't involve foreign key a_idx, so that whatever outcome of the transaction in session 1 would be there is no interdependency and update in session 2 should be allowed to proceed. -MaximThe operating system will not start in any mode, I can't follow those steps you gave me if I can't get to the task manager or anywhere else for that matter.

Beckham won't appear in the show, but has given his blessing to the production, which will use his name and footage of his famous free kicks. There may even be a song dedicated to the soccer hero. Workshops for the musical are planned for early next year, but the show isn't expected to open until fall 2013, or possibly 2014.
Directed by Gurinder Chadha, who also helmed the original film, the stage adaptation will feature a score by Howard Goodall and lyrics by Charles Hart (Phantom of the Opera). The show, whose title refers to Beckham's ability to curve the ball into the net from seemingly impossible angles, follows a young woman in London who rebels against her orthodox Sikh parents' traditionalism by pursuing her dream of being a professional soccer player. The 2002 film starred Parminder Nagra, Jonathan Rhys Meyers and Keira Knightley in her first major role.
The Beckham family recently attended the London premiere of Viva Forever!, the new stage show featuring the songs of David's wife Victoria's pop group the Spice Girls. The other Spice Girls (Mel B, Geri Halliwell, Emma Bunton and Mel C) were also at the glitzy event.

Not only is Titan a, well, titan in the GPU space, it's also based on architecture that's been used in several supercomputers. This fact has led CyberPower to declare this the "Gaming Supercomputer" era, which for CyberPower actually begins on February 21, which is when customers will be able to configure Titan in new builds.
 PC says.
The GeForce GTX Titan will be available as an upgrade option on systems built around AMD's FX and Intel's X79 and Z77 platforms. Such systems will also feature CyberPower PC's Hydro 2 Liquid Cooling Kit.
Best of all, systems featuring the GeForce GTX Titan will start at just $1,699, a pretty impressive price point considering the Titan is a $1,000 GPU.

I asked them to send me the receipts for 5 recent charges from the same Mexican Food place across the street from me. I love Mexican food, but there’s no way I could have eaten 5 meals in a row from this place (esp when I wasn’t even working from home that week), so something was awry.
Herein lies the rub. If they send me the receipts (which include signatures), I can no longer dispute the charges because now I’m in possession of the sales receipts. Even if the signatures on the receipts clearly show an invalid signature, I have forgone the ability to issue a charge back. I asked the customer support if they could visually verify that the 5 signatures closely matched all my other signatures, but that was impossible. They didn’t have the ability to view the receipts.
I find this totally absurd. Granted, using a signature as a form authorization is incredibly fallible, the fact that it’s not even relevant when disputing a charge, raises the question why do we even need to sign the receipt at all? The back of my credit card is not signed, so that means that they would have been required to view a valid form of identification, which obviously wasn’t the case and is rarely ever the case. I suppose it’s all a moot point. BofA reversed the charges regardless, which was nice of them. I would have just preferred a more thorough process.
this is hilarious. glad to hear you got your money back =)
what a good trick, don't sign the back of the card so it is more likely that vendors ask for id. i live in norway and was on vacation in the US 2 weeks ago and stores asked me EVERY time for additional id even though my signature was on my visa card.
Bank of America is one of the few companies on my blacklist they STOLE thousands of dollars in cash from me and my wife, and did not give it back for over 90 days, treating us like criminals in the mean time. Stop doing business with them, please.

My `production' machine has reached its limit of 4, and I'm cautiously considering upgrading parts of it, not yet sure if that limit is thanks to device minor numbers or what, but then, its hardware capacity is almost reached with three USB DVB devices.

NEWPORT BEACH, Calif.--Nov. 9, 2005--With the tremendous rise of identity theft and online fraud, the U.S. federal government has imposed new online authentication guidelines for financial institutions operating web based transactions. These guidelines are to be met by the related companies in 2006, providing a short time and lacking specific methods for compliance.
"Current solutions the banks have tested fail to reliably identify customers and defeat keyboard logging, phishing or other socially engineered fraud," commented Jeff Crandell, Director of Product Development for Newport Scientific Research.
"The problem with tokens and other alternatives are that they really don't fix the authentication issue, they just shorten the password life, or require additional questions to be answered. And these methods have already proven to be beaten by keyboard loggers and other Trojans," said Crandell. "By the time a password changes in 60 seconds, your account can be empty."
"FBiSureID represents a real solution to the problem," says Crandell. "Only by eliminating passwords can you truly defeat fraud and hacking efforts." The FBiSureID technology replaces traditional login and password access to web sites with fingerprint identification access via the FBiDrive, bypassing the most abused weakness of protected Internet sites.
"Token systems and multi question authentication systems can already be beaten by combining keyboard logging software with automated raids on customer accounts," says Crandell. "Therefore financial institutions using these technologies are steps behind the aggressive worldwide fraud and identity theft community."
The patent pending FBiSureID technology is a new breed of authentication technologies which can provide two factor identification without making users enter more answers to login questions or rotating passwords. "No matter what questions financial sites ask the consumer to answer, the responses can be stolen by keyboard loggers or phishing tricksters," says Crandell. "And unlike the question and answer game, with FBiSureID customers couldn't reveal their access information even if they wanted to."
Financial institutions have already tried password changing tokens, but with extremely limited results. "Less than 1% of ETrade customers signed up for password generating tokens," commented John Shanahan Jr., Vice President of Newport Scientific Research. "We believe this is because tokens add extra steps to the login process and they are single purpose devices. People don't want to carry a pocket full of these things.
"With the FBiDrive and FBiSureID, users click and provide a fingerprint. They don't even have to launch the web browser and type the web site address," commented Shanahan. "Consumers become quickly addicted to this shortcut process. Our research has shown that widespread customer acceptance will only happen by offering security along with convenience."
A recent CNN (NYSE?) article reports that, "banks also fear a 'necklace' scenario in which customers end up collecting an annoying strand of tokens." With the FBiSureID technology, consumers can use the FBiDrive device to more safely access banks with traditional login password technology while simultaneously connecting with banks that support the extremely secure fingerprint access technology.
"One of the great features of the FBiSureID technology, is that the bank never gets a copy of your fingerprint," comments Shanahan. "A biometric password is stored at the bank, which can only be generated by the customer's fingerprint. But the customer's fingerprint is never exposed to anyone including bank staff and officials."
The patent pending FBiSureID technology uses fingerprint data to generate a biometrically unique access key for each protected web site account, thus the site never acquires the consumer's actual fingerprint. And the technology is server technology independent, allowing any standard web server and development suite to utilize it without installing third party software.
FBiSureID is currently available without a server license fee and is compatible with Microsoft (Nasdaq?), IBM (NYSE?) Sun (Nasdaq?), Red Hat (Nasdaq?), and other standard web server and development technologies. It was designed to be easily integrated into existing online applications.
The FBiDrive is available in standard and enterprise versions and can be obtained directly from the company and through online and distribution partners.

It’s the first unavoidable sign that there’s something amiss in Amy’s relationship with the Doctor, the first sign she sees him as something other than an equal. It shows that she has a childish perception of him: he’s there to fix things for her. That’s the point of his existence. If he doesn’t do that, he’s worthless to her.
This is totally dehumanizing and selfish on her part, right? The Doctor is a person, after all. He has desires and needs and purposes of his own; he doesn’t live to fulfill her hopes.
So why do we tolerate that kind of language about half the human population?
(Click the end of each quote for source.)
For the typical woman, I’m sorry to say nature is not in your favor. You are meant to have fat, and your biology will make sure you do. This is primarily due to the fact that your body was made to bear children.
We must stop chasing the impossible – this “thin ideal.” Because most fashion models are thinner than 98% of most American women. Because if mannequins were women, they would be too thin to bear children. It’s time to focus on the “healthy ideal,” which looks different for every woman, and focuses on health, not weight or size.
It is natural for women to be able to bear children, and if the “ideal” means that you would not actually be able to do something that is natural for your body, then obviously it’s not really that healthy.
And even if women bear themselves weary or they bear themselves out that does not hurt. Let them bear themselves out. This is the purpose for which they exist.
(Attributed to Martin Luther. My searching has turned up dubious results on the authenticity of this quotation. Can anybody with facts help me out here? Everything I’ve read on the quote is polemical, saying (a) Luther never said it, or (b) yes, he totally did, or (c) Luther said it but was grossly misunderstood. Doing a proper study of the quote would take more time than I have to allocate!)
And, last but not least, the actual statement made to my anorexic teenage self by a member of my old church:
But women without fat on their hips can’t bear children!
Nice to know you care, lady.
You’ve probably noticed that the above quotations aren’t just from religious people. This is pop culture as much as it is Christian culture. A related phenomenon is the reduction of all observed biological differences to testosterone-estrogen levels:
Why women respond differently seems obvious. Women are, after all, awash in the hormone estrogen, which, some new science suggests, has greater effects on metabolism and muscle health than was once imagined.
The limitations of such generalizations came into a stark light a few years ago when South African athlete Caster Semenya was subjected to “gender testing” and forced to withdraw from competition due to intersexed characteristics that caused her to drastically outperform her fellow female competitors. So convenient have testosterone and estrogen been for explaining the differences between men and women that medical and athletic publications often have to remind readers that women have any testosterone at all.
Without getting lost in the medical details, I want to talk about the “what for” part of biology – the part that ceases to be biology and becomes culture.
When I was a little girl, every “why” I asked about my body was catapulted back to childbearing:
Why do I have a period? Because your body is getting ready to get pregnant.
Why am I gaining weight? Because estrogen makes you store fat. Why? Because your body needs fat to insulate the baby when you’re pregnant.
Why do I have breasts? For feeding your babies. Why do they stick out? To attract men so they’ll want to have babies with you.
Why are boys stronger than me? Because your body was meant to have babies, not build muscle.
Why shouldn’t I be skinny? Because you won’t be able to have babies!
“But,” you might say, “some of those questions were about reproduction! Of course menstruation is linked to childbearing – it’s your uterus, after all!” Yeah. Sure. Them’s the facts. The problem is, nobody ever explained to me that menstruation is an indicator of health for women – they just jumped straight to childbearing as the reason I shouldn’t starve myself. Nobody bothered to talk to me about vitamins, minerals and the risk of osteoporosis. It was just about the babies.
Nobody bothered to tell me that women can get strong, either. Nobody told me that plenty of women are physically bigger and stronger than a great many men. Nobody mentioned that, in a culture where strength is seen as masculine and men are expected to do heavy work for women, women have fewer opportunities to develop their strength. Nobody acknowledged that women are actively discouraged from putting on muscle because “bulky” isn’t “sexy”. Nobody handed me a barbell and said, “Well, why don’t we see what you can do with this?”
The problem isn’t that references to childbearing are factually wrong, it’s that they’re far too often the only answer girls get. Girls! Your lives aren’t defined by the possibility of pregnancy, even if you do bleed once a month. Estrogen isn’t just some annoying substance that makes you cramp up and gain weight so you can have babies – it helps you by strengthening your bones. Your period may factually be about your uterine lining and fertility, but that’s not the whole story, either. Your period can help tell you whether or not there’s anything wrong in your body, like a nutrition deficiency. What your period is might be a matter of science, but what it’s for is what our culture makes of it.
Your body may have the capacity to bear children, but that’s not what it’s for. It’s for keeping you alive.
The point of your body is you.
Although I couldn’t articulate it at the time, I definitely noticed as a girl how nothing about young men’s health was explained in terms of their potential for fatherhood.
Why is my voice changing? Testosterone. You’re becoming a man.
Why am I sprouting all this hair? Testosterone. You’re becoming a man.
Why am I getting so tall so fast? Testosterone. You’re becoming a man.
Why do I wake up in the morning with an erection? Testosterone. You’re becoming a man.
Well, that was easy. If we explained things to boys the way we do to girls, the answers would look more like this:
Why is my voice changing? It’s a sign that you’re getting ready to be a father.
Why am I sprouting all this hair? To keep you warm since you don’t have enough estrogen to store more fat.
Why am I getting so tall so fast? So you can compete with other men and have more children.
Why do I wake up in the morning with an erection? Your hormones are telling you to go out and reproduce.
Fertility is just not center stage when we talk to boys, even about puberty. When we talk to kids of all sexes, we provide two answers: the biological cause (testosterone or estrogen) and the social meaning (you’re becoming an adult), but only one sex gets the extra level of what for. What if the what for wasn’t always about pregnancy? What if boys were given a what for that involved their potential to father children?
Finally, I don’t want to end this post without acknowledging that the questions kids ask about puberty are usually much more complex and infused with anxieties about what kind of adults they want to be. If you’re a cis male and worried about your body hair, it might well be because you don’t want to have it or you’re worried you don’t have enough. If you’re a transgendered kid of either sex, you might be negotiating the problem of your body taking a wrong turn towards a kind of adulthood you don’t want – or you might be frustrated that society is interpreting your body’s changes as a sign that your personality is changing, too. If you’re a cis female, you might resent getting your breasts or period early or be worried that you haven’t got them yet, or that there’s something “wrong” with the way they’re presenting. In real life, the what for can be damaging on all kinds of levels. Who we want to become seldom looks anything like the Ken-and-Barbie prognostications we get from our parents and teachers. In my own case, the explanation I got was exactly who I was most afraid of becoming.
What will I do about it? I don’t know for sure. But if I ever have a little girl, I have some ideas to start with. I’ll make sure to tell her, whenever pregnancy comes up, that it’s a matter of “if you want to,” not “when you do.” I’ll tell her that her period has meanings other than “hey, you’re ovulating!” – even if the only other reason I can come up with is “hey, you’re not malnourished!” (yay, right?!). And I’ll tell her that whatever her body does is normal for her – whether that means she hits puberty “early,” “late,” or never.
Oh, and most importantly: The point of you is you.

Spirituality on:The family of former Bradford man Gareth Huntley, whose body was found in the Malaysian jungle, have paid an emotional tribute to him.
The Foreign Office confirmed at the weekend that Malaysian police had identified a body found close to where he had been living on Tioman Island as that of 34-year-old Mr Huntley.
Unconfirmed reports suggest that Malaysian detectives are treating his death as suspicious amid speculation that he was found with his throat cut.
The former pupil of Woodhouse Grove School in Apperley Bridge went missing on May 27 when he went on a trek to a waterfall. The wildlife volunteer had been helping to monitor the welfare of sea turtles.
His body was found on Wednesday but was only identified after his Bradford mother, Janet Southwell, who had travelled to the island, gave blood to hospital staff so a DNA comparison could be carried out..”
Mr Huntley’s body was found in a pond only a short distance from a kayak storage shed at the Juara Turtle Project where he had been volunteering. An iPhone was found nearby but there was no sign of any personal documentation.
Last night a cause of death had yet to be.”
Mr Huntley was on a sabbatical from his job in the City of London. His family mounted a campaign to intensify the search for him after he failed to return.

Ilang Ivohibe is a soapy and slightly synthetic Ylang perfume with, as people below have pointed out, a unisex feel.
It's odd because from the listed notes you'd expect more of a citrus/floral.
This feels to me exactly like a slightly aquatic liquid soap and I'm not keen on liquid soap. I'd also expect antiseptic handwash to smell like this. Looking at comments below, apparently lavender is listed on another site. I dislike lavender as a strong note in perfumes, because it feels medicinal to me. A comfort scent if you're worried about germs I suppose! There's a slight suntan lotion aroma - salicylates maybe or something like that?
I have an organic Ylang in EDP by perfumers Balm Balm, I've also had the essential oil on occasions and I find that this perfume doesn't star or enhance Ylang's sunny floral feel. Ylang esential oil or absolute does have a sort of 'tea-like' aspect - a sort of fresh astringency alongside indolic banana-ish white floral. If they'd wanted a savoury unisex feel I think a tea-like note would have worked better
It seems to me this perfume has used a cheap synthetic 'aqua' aroma you'd find in any old soap,shaving foam or washing up liquid even. Maybe it's the lavender effect.
I haven't yet tried others from Parfumerie Generale and have heard better things about their other perfumes, so I'll still give those a try..
On the PG website lavender orris and patchouli are listed as a key ingredients for this scent as well as vanilla and yang-yang but no others. No jasmine or orange. I'm confused?
133) Unisex fragrance around the Ylang-Ylang (flower of flowers) on a base of vanilla and a very large dose of orange.
Super simple composition and in the same kind I prefer a scent like Saint-Tropez from Smell Bent, better composed and which costs twice cheaper.
Parfum unisexe autour de l'Ylang-Ylang (la fleur des fleurs) sur une base de vanille et une très large dose d'orange.
Composition hyper simple et dans le même genre je préfère un parfum comme Saint-Tropez de Smell Bent, mieux composé et qui coute deux fois moins cher.
A perfume I had packed away and forgotten about, so a nice surprise and perfect to put me in mind of summer holidays. Instant hits of ylang, tuberose and frangipani/coconut sunscreen (or actually oil in the days when people still oiled themselves up on the beach!). I get as much from the vanilla gourmand notes as the floral ones. The vanilla reminds me of the scent of a warm creme brulee with browned caramelised sugar on top waiting to be cracked with a silver spoon -and is making me return to sniff my wrists over and over, or maybe it could be an almond tart fresh out of the oven waiting to cool and be served with a jug of chilled vanilla custard.. Try as I might I don't get citrus notes, no orange at all in fact.
Tuberose always adds a creaminess and weight to the body of a perfume for me, as do frangipani and magnolia which I also find in Ilang Ivohibe. Sometimes these notes can be too overpowering but not here (although they might be the reason I can't get the orange, there's just not enough orange to cut through the creaminess), they blend wonderfully to produce something both comforting and at the same time exotic. I feel like I could be in Bali lounging in a hammock in the late afternoon surrounded by beautiful flowers, their perfume trailing in the light breeze, while brightly coloured birds flutter in the shade of the trees. The jasmine is cocooned within these heavyweight notes and as such is for once more of a minor character here IMO. I do also detect some of the vegetal notes at the start, but they don't last on my skin so for me the result is a wholly feminine perfume. The silage is pretty good but the drydown is quite simplistic and mainly vanilla for me, I would compare it to Tocade or Iceberg Universe Woman after a couple of hours, very edible but a bit too sweet, so I would probably stick to daytime wear in the summer months. As such I am really enjoying revisiting this perfume, it's a beautiful composition, very calming and takes me away to a sunny beach every time I catch a trace of it on my skin.
Update: Just inhaled this directly from the bottle and I can now smell the orange/neroli, slightly bitter yet candied too, but as soon as I let it out or near my skin it disappears!
A refined and pretty elegant white floral composition laying an a creamy vanilla base. While Ilang Ivohibè can't be considered a monster in projection it still has a quite remarkable presence and a satisfying lasting power with its slightly dusty allure that's tipycal of many of the Guillame's compositions. Usually marketed as feminine but not being too affected, I believe it could do great also on a man. Recommended.
Rating: 7/10
On me this goes on a touch too masculine then dries down to a beautiful soft feminine scent... Kind of like 'your skin - only better' scent. I really like it!
Fairly faint vanilla with ylang and a sunscreen note, probably the jasmine and orange together. I get almost no sillage and it's very hard to smell on my wrist. Nice, but overall nothing very interesting. Surprising from this perfumer who does a few of my all-time favorites.
The strange thing about this fragrance is that it could easily be unisex or masculine- on me it opens with intense ylang but dries down into a green-masculine scent. It is pleasant and very refined but I prefer more feminine perfumes!

The bulk of the collection consists of documents relating to the settlement of Joseph M. Quimby's estate in 1921 and 1922 by George West, the executor. There are a few letters going back to the 1850s, an assortment of deeds of the 1880s and 1890s, and papers related to Quimby family matters during from 1900 to 1920.
Among documents from the settlement of the estate are a large collection of the receipts for outstanding debts owed by Joseph at the time of his death, collected by West in his role as executor; correspondence from Pulsifer relatives establishing their legal rights to part of the estate; an accounting of the estate expenses by West and the various divisions of the estate. The collection also includes Joseph Quimby's will and codicil; correspondence with Frederick Southgate of the Woodstock, Vermont, probate court; and correspondence from Fred Quimby on how the estate should most fairly be settled.
The letters include four from Rachel B. Stone to her son Henry M. Stone, dated 1850, 1851, and 1853, a letter to Ella E. West, a teacher in Hartford, Vermont, written by her mother, who was visiting Arkansas City, Kansas, dated 1887, and a chatty letter from Cynthia Bugbee to her sister, Emeline Bugbee, who was at school in Meridien, New Hampshire.
Joseph M. Quimby of Hartford, Vermont, was married four times. Mary Lane Quimby died October 23, 1872; Alma Elkins Quimby died May 16, 1878; Emily Pulsifer Quimby died February 9, 1889; and his surviving wife was Ella E. Quimby. Ella had formerly been married to Charles H. West (died September 23, 1886), and the executor of Joseph's estate was George West, the son of Ella and Charles H. West. George West was a lawyer and manager of the Vermont Baking Company of White River Junction. The will left the estate to George West and to the nieces and nephews of Emily Pulsifer Quimby. These children were Emma R. Antill and Avis Antill of Dexter, Maine, and Leonard Carver Pulsifer.File this one under Lifehacks That’ll Make Your Summer That Much Sweeter.
Mortals like me who spend our dog days slicing watermelons the old-fashioned way have a whole new lease on life these days. This unidentified fruit surgeon—classified as a physical therapist by This Blew My Mind, the website that posted his YouTube video—has arrived with a brand new way to chop up the delicious summer snack.
The technique requires a decent amount of knife skills, especially if you want to make it look as smooth as this guy can. Essentially, it only requires a few exterior cuts and a series of slices to the actual fruit.
Once the initial cuts are made, it’s one fell swoop of alleviating any ties the fruit has to the rind. Then dump the full contents into a bag or bowl and bam: your summers just got a whole lot more convenient.
We here at the Daily Dot also believe you could pull the same move with an onion—or, you know, a honeydew melon, cantaloupe, mango, or casaba.

Almond Chocolate
Pastry Ring
Recently I've been fooling around with almond flour, which is
essentially finely ground blanched almonds. I love the rich flavor it
adds to baked goods, but at 12 bucks a pound, I'm not going to be
adding it to everything. Here is a recipe using almond flour that is
quite rich (that's saying a lot when I say it) and easy to whip up.
As with most of my bread recipes, the dough is mixed up a day or
two ahead of time and refrigerated until use. This allows the dough
to reach its full flavor potential and helps make the baking process
easier. As those of you who take my classes know, I work every
other weekend, and I try to take fresh baked pastries to work on
Saturday and Sunday to help reward my coworkers for making it out
of bed. I'll typically mix up the dough on Thursday night (a double
batch, for both Saturday and Sunday), then roll out and form the
pastries Friday night and Saturday night. The formed pastries are
covered and refrigerated until Saturday and Sunday mornings. I'll
get up at 5:22 am, turn on the oven and take the pastries out of the
refrigerator to warm up. The pastries go in the oven when I go in
the shower and are ready to go to work with me at 7 am.
Almond Pastry Dough
In a large bowl, mix together the dry ingredients, then make a well in
the middle and add the honey, eggs, butter, and water. Stir until
well mixed, then stir vigorously another 30 seconds. Cover and
allow to rise at room temperature for 2 hours then refrigerate, OR
refrigerate immediately and wait at least 12 hours to use dough.
Chocolate Almond Pastry Ring
Filling
Place the chocolate chips in a glass bowl, and microwave on high for
about 2 minutes until melted, stirring at each minute. Stir the
sweetened condensed milk into the melted chocolate. Crumble the
almond paste then stir into the chocolate mixture. Microwave
another 1-2 minutes if the filling is too stiff to spread.
On a floured surface, roll out the almond pastry dough into a 16 by
24 inch rectangle. Spread the filling evenly over the dough then roll
up from the long side to form a long cylinder. Seal the dough at the
seam along the length of the cylinder then roll until uniform and
about 24 inches in diameter. Cut the roll into 24 one inch discs,
then arrange in a ring or in lines on a parchment lined baking
sheet. Cover lightly with plastic wrap and refrigerate until ready to
use or proceed with baking after a 30 minute rest.
Preheat the oven to 400 F and remove the pastries from the
refrigerator and allow to warm up to room temperature, covered,
while the oven preheats. Place the baking sheet in the oven and
turn the oven down to 375 F. Bake about 24 minutes until lightly
browned then cool on a wire rack. Allow cool almost completely
then drizzle with your favorite icing and sprinkle with the slivered
almonds. Yum!

"California last week became the first state to integrate green building practices, largely based on the U.S. Green Building Council’s Leadership in Efficiency and Environmental Design (LEED) standards, into its statewide building codes.
It was a big, Governator-style move, but while the USGBC officially supports CalGreen, and most in the green building world see it as a net-positive step, not everyone is thrilled about it. In fact many architects, engineers and city planners that fully support the integration of green building practices in the building code are concerned about the challenges involved in implementing and enforcing that code — and those are the building professionals who are advocates of green building in the first place."
Amy Westervelt reports for SolveClimate January 20, 2010. [2]LOGAN, Utah — It wasn't the type of performance that'll get Western Michigan University men's basketball team very far over the next three months. But it was enough not to leave Utah 0-3.
The Broncos battled themselves as much as they did an Idaho State team without much firepower, never able to get any significant separation. Eventually the clock ran out and WMU was ahead, 63-60.
"We had about 2 minutes to go in the game," Broncos coach Steve Hawkins began, "and we were nursing a little bit of a lead, and I said (to assistant Larry Farmer), 'We’ve got to find a way to win a game, just get out of here.'"
"It was one of those games where we looked tired, I thought both teams did."
Mikey Douglas' four late free throws helped WMU survive a game it led from 50-48 on, but never by more than five points.
WMU (6-6) finished its trek to Great West at 1-2, losing Tuesday to Troy in overtime and late Wednesday to host Utah State, before Thursday night's win in the Broncos' final game at the World Vision Invitational.
On a night when WMU's junior trio of Flenard Whitfield, Demetrius Ward and Douglas combined to make just 5 of 18 field goals and score 18 points together, freshman Matt Stainbrook (15 points, 10 rebounds), Alex Wolf (12 points) and Nate Hutcheson (10 points, five rebounds) saved the Broncos against Idaho State's zone.
Whitfield did pull down a career-high 13 rebounds before fouling out for the second straight night.
"I don’t know what kind of energy we came out with," said Wolf, who's five early points, created on the drive, brought WMU back to within 14-11 after a dreadful start. "It just didn’t feel right for some reason. It’s tough, three games in three days."
Next: WMU vs. Eastern Illinois
When: 2 p.m. Dec. 31, University Arena
Tickets: $18, $16 and $10 ($10 holiday special includes hot dog, chips and drink); 888-4-WMU-TIX
Records: WMU 6-6; Eastern Illinois 5-7
TV, Radio: WKZO-FM (96.5)
Hutcheson and fellow small forward Juwan Howard Jr. (eight points, six rebounds) attacked Idaho State's zone throughout, creating and scoring near the hoop when nothing from outside was falling.
"Everybody wants to shoot the ball against the zone, it's just a natural instinct," Hutcheson said. "But we all know you have to drive, you’ve got to take it inside."
Said Howard: "We didn’t shoot well but we also didn’t rebound well today. We had 18 turnovers and allowed 18 offensive rebounds and that’s giving a team 36 extra possessions, and that’s something we shouldn’t be giving them. We got lucky, winning by three and giving up 36 extra possessions in the game."
WMU made 36 percent of its shots, though Idaho State (4-8) hit just 33 percent.
In an effort to counter the tired legs, Hawkins played 10 players, including extended minutes for Wolf (25 minutes) and Brandon Pokley (10).
"We had to use some fresh legs tonight," said Hawkins, who chose not to play sophomore shooting guard David Brown at all, even though Brown played only 10 minutes the night before.
Lithuanian big man Deividas Busma led the Bengals with 16 points and 13 rebounds, proving too quick for Stainbrook. The Broncos kept Idaho State guard Broderick Gilchrest in check. Gilchrest nearly hit his 16-point average with 13 points, but shot 4-for-14 from the floor.
The Broncos don't play again until Eastern Illinois visits University Arena at 2 p.m. on New Year's Eve. The players are off from practice until Dec. 28.
"It’s a sour taste still," Wolf said. "We thought we could have won that first game against Troy. That’s a tough game to lose in overtime.
"But definitely three losses would have been a lot, lot more sour taste opening presents on Christmas."

I purchased this book for my nephew who is in middle school. He has always had a dislike for reading but this series caught his interest. I have purchased all books in the Percy Jackson series and my nephew LOVES them. It has encouraged him to read more and he now is showing an appreciation of books. I am happy that these books put him on the path of reading.
I knew the books were what I needed to give as gifts to my son for his bday. Of course he is very happy to have them. I was disappointed the way I received the package though. First when I got it, I thought one or more books would be missing bc the packaging was poorly done.

ATLANTA, Ga. — It probably would have been just another ho-hum city council budget meeting.
Except that the leader of Atlanta's police union, and second-highest ranking member of the International Brotherhood of Police Officers, said he wanted to beat Atlanta's mayor with a bat.
Full story: Ga. cop apologizes after saying he wanted to beat mayor with batCultural district board holds its first meeting
Culture Establishing a work plan, website and outdoor space rules among topics addressed
The Newberg Cultural District Executive Board held its first meeting Nov. 5 to develop a work plan as well as a specific vision for its website.
The website, culturaldistrict.org, has been purchased, but board chairwoman Leah Griffith said it still needed to be built and how the monthly service fee would be handled needed to be established.
Theres a lot of little things, she said.
At the meeting it was established that Chehalem Cultural Center staff are working on the website and it should be launched in basic form by December. They are also looking into purchasing the .com version of the web address.
During the next few months the board will work on developing rules for use of outdoor spaces which includes evaluating current rules held by the separate entities, improving calendar functionality, procedures for events that require a parking action plan around the CCC, and methods of communication with the neighborhood and community.
For now, at least, these methods will not include social media, at CCC Executive Director Rob Daileys recommendation.
The Newberg Cultural District is simply a geographical identifier, a place, and not an entity. It is a place that is co-owned and co-managed by several actual entities, said Dailey, who also serves as the NCD secretary. There will always be some entity that has initiated and will promote the activity on its own whether that is the library and the Cultural District in partnership or an outside party like a Rotary Club.
Dailey said the NCD itself doesnt have anything to promote, so creating a social media campaign would be redundant.
The districts website is an information hub, where the public will be able to find information about the district, link to district partners websites, see a calendar of district activities, find forms, etc., he said. None of this needs to be pushed on the public. Besides, all the district entities already maintain a social media presence.
For the next meeting, scheduled at 6 p.m. Dec. 3 at the CCC, the library and CCC will have developed their baseline daily use numbers for discussion.TRIBECA — 'Tis the season to pack on the pounds.
From scrumptious holiday cookies and decadent hot chocolate and egg nog, to grandma's famous strudel, the holidays are rife with dangerous menus that threaten to bring end-of-the-year weight gain.
But experts say a holiday feast survival road map can help you steer clear of over-indulgence.
"Healthy meals can be festive as well," said Patricia Nicholas, a registered dietician at New York-Presbyterian Hospital/Columbia University Medical Center. "And hopefully, you have been making healthy changes to your diet all year."
If bread smeared with butter is your downfall, try swapping it with whole wheat pita, Nicholas said. If you're tempted to load up your plate, try eating just a small forkful. And whenever you're hosting a holiday party, be sure to offer fresh fruit and vegetable plates as a side dish to help others on the same mission stay healthy.
"The weight gain is in all the side dishes," said Drew Rosen, a Whole Foods health and wellness team member at the chain's TriBeCa store, at 475 Greenwich St.
When butter-soaked mashed potatoes or creamy macaroni and cheese beckon, try frozen butternut squash tossed with paprika — a savory, healthy dish that's still a hit with guests, he said, adding that the aisles of TriBeCa's Whole Foods are a sea of alternatives to calorie-exploding treats like pecan pie or a cream-infused green bean casserole.
But if you have to have your favorite dish, try a spoonful rather than a plate full, Rosen said.
"If you're [saying], 'Oh my gosh, the mac 'n cheese is so good,' then take a small serving," explained dietitian and registered yoga instructor Julie Marx, who teaches at YogaWorks in SoHo. "It's better than denying yourself."
Other holiday weight-watching strategies include giving away sweets and leftovers to spread holiday cheer — and avoid tipping the scales.
"Give it to skinny friends or to guys. It's so easy for guys to lose weight." said Monica Brown, a Long Island City resident.
"But, maybe not to your husband, " she added, correcting herself as she looked up at her husband with a sheepish grin.
Sometimes the weight gain is spurred by holiday food "pushers," who try to pressure you into breaking your diet so you can try their special seasonal meals, experts said.
Laurence Martinaud, an East Harlem-based nutrition consultant, relies on a medical condition to help avoid fattening foods. She tells co-workers she is gluten-intolerant to avoid sugary foods at the office.
"If you say it's a medical issue, then people leave you alone," she said, "You have to say to yourself, 'Is it worth the calories if it's not going to be heaven?' Unless there's chocolate, then don't bother."
Angelo Butico, 50, said he practices food diplomacy to avoid fatty selections his relatives cook for fear of offending them.
"I push it around the plate and don't eat it," he said.
But not all New Yorkers stress about packing on a few pounds during the holidays.
"I'm the opposite — I say bring it on, " said Danille Oteri, a Washington Height resident who owns her own food business, Culinary Ancestry, which compiles old family recipes into personalized cookbooks. "Holiday foods are my favorite, and I have a business in Italian food."
The proud Italian-American was on her first grocery run to buy supplies to make her first her first batch of struffoli, an Italian-style doughnut served only at Christmas.
"If you're not going to have struffoli for Christmas, then you're not going to have it at any other time of the year," Oteri said, standing next to her friend Luisa Rasiej.
"You can't have struffoli in June or July, that's just wrong!" Rasiej added.
Still, even a few pounds on the scale at the end of the year isn't a sign you've failed, experts noted.
"We have this big stigma about being thin and healthy, and the normalcy is to be slower and reflective during this time of year." Marx said.
"But it's not a ticket to go into free fall either."Search

Humans pump thousands of tons of vapor from the metallic element mercury into the atmosphere each year, and it can remain suspended for long periods before being changed into a form that is easily removed from the atmosphere.
LAS VEGAS, July 19, 2011 /PRNewswire/ -- The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) "cherry-picked" research to support its biased air emission rules for power plants.
Feathers collected from the rare Pacific black-footed albatross over the past 120 years have helped researchers from Harvard University track increases in the neurotoxin methylmercury in the endangered bird, which forages extensively throughout the Pacific.
A newly sequenced bacterial genome from a team led by the Department of Energy's Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL) could contain clues as to how microorganisms produce a highly toxic form of mercury.
Although research has shown that eating fish, which is rich in beneficial omega-3 fatty acids, is associated with lower risk of cardiovascular diseases, mixed evidence from prior studies has suggested that mercury exposure from fish consumption may be linked to higher risk of cardiovascular diseases.
Mercury contamination, a worldwide environmental problem, has been called "public enemy No. 1" in California's San Francisco Bay.
Nature has a bit of a Jekyll and Hyde relationship with mercury, but researchers at the Department of Energy's Oak Ridge National Laboratory have made a discovery that ultimately could help explain the split personality.

NEW YORK ( Trefis) -- Facebook's decision to put up advertisements on the news feed may act as a further deterrent to the social network's users.
As Facebook's much hyped IPO approaches, it has stepped on the gas to bolster its monetization. However this could come at the expense of aggravating users. Facebook leads in the social networking space with competitors such as Google (GOOG - Get Report) and is increasingly taking ad revenues away from struggling sites Yahoo (YHOO - Get Report) and AOL (AOL - Get Report).

Facebook is not exactly facing a cash crunch. The company's advertising revenues are already expected to double in 2011 from last year, reaching around $3.8 billion. Additionally, the company has consistently expanded its revenue stream further by acting as a host site for various services such as music and games. It seems the company is in a rush to increase its monetization before its anticipated IPO, in order to achieve an even more lucrative valuation.Is putting further ads up on the news feed worth the risk?

As Election Day is behind us and we’re coming up to Thanksgiving and Christmas, and, oh yea, winter, here’s what I’m thinking on a cold November day:
* Not only is Election Day behind us, but so is the 2012 Breeders’ Cup. I truly believe we can host the Breeders’ Cup here in Saratoga Springs and I made the point before if Green Bay fans will sit in Lambeau Field in frigid weather to watch football, then diehard Saratoga fans will certainly sit through 40-something degree weather to see such a special event. I wrote a commentary for the Times Union on this plan last year and started a Facebook page supporting the cause at that time as well. My vision is not really taking off, but I still think it could work.
* I got a kick out of seeing the TV commercials for Saratoga Casino and Raceway that were shown during the Breeders Cup. They showed a bunch of attractive twenty-something females at the Casino having a good ‘ol time. That’s not a representation of the crowd I usually see hanging at the Saratoga Casino – I must be going on the wrong nights. Don’t let my snarky comments dissuade you – click here to find out how you can get 10% off your group event there.
* Just down the street from the Casino, the Saratoga Six Condominiums are not only for sale, but they’re also for rent – On Craigslist even. If you’re going to be selling condos in this market, I guess it makes sense to get some rental income while the selling is slow. I wrote about this project early last year when it was called “Jefferson Flats” condominiums. They could have done some fun commercials with the “Movin’ on Up” theme from The Jeffersons television show. OK, maybe not.
* The Saratoga Farmer’s Market moved indoors. Or did it? I noticed this past Saturday that a few of the vendors, including my favorite Kilpatrick Family Farm, are defying Mother Nature and staying outside for a few more weeks.
* I reported on Sabinas closing a few weeks ago. Now the Turf Club, down Union Avenue from Sabinas in the Springwater Inn building, has closed as well. That’s sad news, but not necessarily surprising.
* The Saratoga Dog Park is a pretty cool place. It’s another tiny thing that makes Saratoga Springs special.
* A few Saratoga snippets from some local newspaper blogs: The Times Union Table Hopping blogs is reporting that the owners of Shirley’s is changing the name of the Jonesville Country Store, which they bought a while back. The new name will be Shirley’s Café. Congratulations to Druthers Brewing for winning the Maple Mix-off, by creating a Manhattan using Crown Royal Maple-Finished Whiskey. Saratoga Olive Oil and Capriccio Saratoga are teaming up for a dinner this Sunday. Finally, the Saratogian’s In the Biz blog is reporting that Ravenous is celebrating its 13th anniversary.
Around and about:
* This Saturday is Neighborhood Toy Store Day at G. Willikers.
* Mazzone Hospitality is collecting pajamas and books for Hurricane Sandy victims.
* Universal Preservation Hall’s November newsletter is out. This Saturday will also be Taylor’s Heroes Rock of Ages Birthday Bash at UPH. It is a charity event to be held in honor of Taylor Miller, who died serving our country in Afghanistan in 2010. Proceeds will benefit the promotion of health and wellness in children including the fight against childhood obesity.
* Customer Appreciation Days are here at Wild Birds Unlimited!
* Beer Tasting at Boca and Wine Dinner at Chianti.
Have a great weekend!

iPad Brings Kids Apps To Life
Let’s face it, the iPad is a toy. It may be the most universally desired toy since the bicycle, something three-year-olds in the throes of princess mania and their gadget-hungry grandparents can get equally excited about. But with it’s big easy touch screen and bright colors, it’s especially appealing to kids.
App makers know this, and they’re releasing rocking apps for kids with the iPad in mind.
I haven’t had the pleasure of playing with an iPad myself yet (feel free to send me one, Apple), so this piece is more PSA than review. The link above lists off some apps that work especially well on an iPad.
When the iPad was first announced, a friend said to me that he figured the real target audience for this thing was 10-year-old girls. His own daughter is a little younger, but when he showed it to her she got all excited. Until she realized there was no camera, which made her favorite app useless on it.
Without a camera, video or GPS, a lot of my kids favorite apps won’t run. Others are being quickly released to take their places though, and I’m sure that the larger screen more than makes up for the loss in the minds of my three-year-old.

Phil Vischer is probably best known as the squeaky voice of Bob the Tomato, animated co-host on the popular VeggieTales video series. But Vischer has other interests: co-creator of the program, he also penned the screenplay for The Pirates Who Don’t Do Anything: A VeggieTales Movie. This represents two significant movie firsts: it is the first VeggieTales film to be distributed by a major Hollywood studio and it is Universal’s first computer-animated theatrical release.

2008
A well-known vehicle for Christian values entertainment, VeggieTales has not always had a smooth road. After releasing Jonah: A VeggieTales Movie in 2003, Big Idea Productions, Inc. went bankrupt, and in 2006, its Saturday morning cartoon, Qubo, endured some controversy when NBC asked that episodes be edited to remove all references to God, a request that drew criticism from the Christian conservative watchdog group, Parents Television Council.
Vischer talked with PopMatters about all things VeggieTales, and revealed that it is by no means your garden variety cartoon.
Would you say writing is your favorite part of what you do, or do you enjoy voice work for the characters just as much?
Voice work is fun, but it’s really tiring because I’m an introvert. So to push the energy for those characters can be exhausting. The writing is fun. I also enjoy what they call the “story reel” phase, where you draw the scripts on the storyboards and you start really pacing the movie. I think a lot of movies live or die based on their pacing, and that happens in animation before a single animator has involved.
How long had the Pirates Who Don’t Do Anything story been in the back of your mind before you wrote it?
It actually wasn’t in my mind at all; I just liked those characters. We had so much fun with them in Jonah: A VeggieTales Movie, even doing the bonus features on the Jonah: A VeggieTales Movie DVD, just playing around with the pirates that we thought, “Wow, they maybe deserve their own adventure!” It was hard because they are the pirates that don’t do anything, and Storytelling 101 says your protagonist needs to have a strong desire for something—something that motivates them. That’s why slacker movies aren’t that much fun to watch; there’s a protagonist that doesn’t really want to do anything. So I had to kind of rewrite their back stories, change them from happy slackers to slackers with a longing to be more than just that, which I was much happier with. You can’t just create a story for kids and promote slacker-ism. So I had to reshape their characters entirely and come up with a motive for them. What did they really want? They want to be heroes, but they have no idea how. Which I think is true for a lot of us.
How much of your own experience went into their story?
Each of the three main characters has some kind of a flaw, something that prevents him from rising up in life and accomplishing and becoming what God would want him to become. And I think each of their flaws resonates with me in a different way. Whether it’s laziness, or not believing in yourself and having no self-confidence, or fearfulness. Larry the Cucumber is terrified of everything. I’m not terrified of everything. He’s terrified of wicker furniture, which has never been an issue for me. Pa Grape’s character flaw is that he backs down too easily. He knows what’s right and he wants to do what’s right but he gets right up to the edge of doing it and somebody looks at him cross-eyed and he just loses all his confidence. And I think I was that way quite a bit when I was a kid.
What kind of relationship do you have with Universal?
We have a pretty good one. Technically, Universal released all the DreamWorks movies, so they released the first two Shrek movies and everything that DreamWorks has done. But they haven’t produced any of them themselves; they were just acquisitions from DreamWorks. So I guess this might be the first one where they’ve ever been involved this deeply. They were very helpful because they’ve got great story people that just live and die reading scripts and making comments and saying, “Mmm, a little too long, a little too short, a little too this, a little too that.” So we ended up with a very good back-and-forth relationship with them. They were very helpful.
Was Big Idea’s bankruptcy related to the Jonah release?
No, it wasn’t. But it was related to a lawsuit with our former distributor [Lyrick Studios] that came at the worst possible time. The timing of it was we had completely funded Jonah ourselves. So all of our money was wrapped up in Jonah, and then we ended up in a lawsuit at the same time, which we lost, and the judge awarded $11 million in damages. And then 18 months later, the appeals court threw out the verdict and said, “No, that’s ridiculous. Big Idea Productions didn’t do anything wrong.” But it was too late. In the middle having tied up all of our money in our first movie, we ended up in a lawsuit that we couldn’t recover from.
What can you tell me about the whole Qubo controversy? Is that settled or is it something that still sticks in your craw?
Well, it doesn’t seem to be a controversy anymore. I think everyone moved on and stopped talking about it. I’m still not thrilled about how it came down, simply because I thought we’d still be able to talk about God in those shows, which is why I got involved in that project. And then we found out, after we were already committed and starting to deliver the episodes, that, “Oh no! You can’t say ‘God’ on NBC.” And since then, I’m not doing any more episodes. Big Idea has somebody else doing adaptations of the old episodes for NBC because I didn’t want to do them. They seem to have loosened up a bit and are allowing a little more of the Christian content to stay in, which is a good thing.
How much appeal do you think the series has to people that may not be Christians?
We don’t know for sure how many VeggieTales fans are non-Christians. That kind of research was never done. But anecdotally, we get a lot of stories from Jewish families, families of different faiths, or families of no particular faith at all who were looking for a way to pass on values to their kids. And because Biblical values tend to be kind of the underpinnings of Western civilization, they had no problem with it at all. Some of our episodes talk specifically about Jesus. Our Easter and Christmas episodes don’t work for some of those people at all. And I wasn’t necessarily trying to do something that would work for everyone because if you try to appeal to everyone, you very often appeal to no one. My first goal was to help Christian parents pass values onto their kids. And the fact that it went far beyond that is really cool. God can do amazing things. I’m all for it.
Are you surprised at how far the series has come since you started it?
For the first five years, every year I kind of thought, “Well, I don’t think we can get any bigger than this.” And then the next year, suddenly we sold twice as many videos as we did the year before. And I’d think, “Wow, I don’t think we can get any bigger than this.” And then the next year, we’d sell twice as many videos again. It was just amazing to combine the kind of humor and storytelling that people like, with the values that resonate for everybody.
I read that you consider your work a ministry first, and a business second.

What’s most interesting to me though is Gwyneth’s rep’s response to the story:
“I don’t rep Chris so I cannot address those accusations.”
Stephen Huvane’s been around a long time. He knows how to choose his words. I mean, he could have easily just said, “We won’t be commenting on all these ridiculous stories”. But he didn’t. He drew a line in the sand and picked his team (that pays for him). Oh OK. Is that what we’re doing now? “I don’t rep Chris” is not something he would have issued before the conscious uncoupling. How disappointed is Team G that Chris’s alleged infidelities are now being revealed? Not very…?

The lineup: Jamie Leffler, Robert Cepeda, Jerrod Bettis, Chris Sanchez.
The background: LA's DWNTWN have been around for a while but they're still new enough, hot enough, buzzy enough, to be showcased recently on a site called BuzzBandsLA. They released two EPs in 2012, Cowboy and the Red Room, both of which figured highly over at Hype Machine but were free downloads only, whereas their latest one, 'Til Tomorrow, is their first to be issued by an actual label, unless you count tracks that appeared on a couple of compilations by cooler-than-thou French label Kitsuné, and you probably should because if you like what DWNTWN do, you'll probably want to hear everything by them. It's probably also worth noting, as we proceed with our justification for writing about DWNTWN later rather than sooner, that 'Till Tomorrow has been mixed by Joe Zook (OneRepublic, Katy Perry), so we can pretend we were waiting for this, their moment in the sun, before featuring them.

They're a four-piece these days but when they formed they were a duo nursing broken hearts - female founder member Jamie Leffler had been dating her male counterpart Robert Cepeda's brother. To help get over their respective splits and subsequent romantic ennui they would spend weekends getting drunk and writing "depressing folk songs", which they would record onto their iPhone - they describe themselves as "a folk band who just happen to make electronic music", their record collections as full of Carter Family and Johnny Cash as they are of bands like Crystal Castles. Soon, those demos had been worked up into proper indie/electronic pop songs, all breathy vocals (that are totally Therese Bazaar, by the way, which pleases us no end) and perky, feathery synthpop melodies. Now they've accrued a local cult following, playing to audiences of around 400, and they're putting out music that could easily multiply that number severalfold. There would appear, on the basis of 'Til Tomorrow, to have been a shift towards a more band-y sound, with more guitars and an accommodation of practices that would allow them to prove themselves in reasonably-sized concert halls around the world. But wherever you alight on their 10-song mini-catalogue, you're bound to find something immensely, transplendently appealing - if, that is, you go for fey C86/cutie indie with a shimmery synth sheen and West Coast lustre, or an LA blog version of Ellie Goulding. And frankly, if you don't, then we're not sure we can carry on being your friend.
The buzz: "We are seriously obsessed."
The truth: Shimmery, ethereal indie/electro-pop in excelsis.
Most likely to: Hurt.
Least likely to: Walk the line.
What to buy: 'Til Tomorrow is released by Julian on April 29.

NASHVILLE, Tenn. (AP) -- A proposal to allow wine to be sold in Tennessee supermarkets and convenience stores has scored its first legislative victory after years of frustration.
The Senate State and Local Government Committee on Tuesday voted 5-4 to advance the bill. The measure would allow cities and counties to hold referendums next year to decide whether to expand wine sales beyond the state's 600 licensed liquor stores.
The proposal has the support of two of the heaviest hitters in the Legislature in Senate Speaker Ron Ramsey of Blountville and House Speaker Beth Harwell of Nashville. Statewide public opinion polls have shown strong support for supermarket wine sales.
The measure would have to be approved by the Senate Finance Committee before heading for a full.December 16, 2010

Ten minutes into the trip, the whitecaps started, and it was great fun surfing the waves. Twenty minutes into the trip I ducked into a quiet bay out of the wind. I then headed south into the wind back to the ramp. For 20 minutes I worked very hard for almost no gain, perhaps one mile an hour. If I had not had to be back in one hour, I would have just stayed out and played. Halfway back, the waves reduced to non-whitecap status, and I was able to increase to 3 or 4 mph.
The complaints I have are minor, with the largest being how wet the ride was, but one should expect that in a SOT. If I could find a kayak 2 feet longer and 2 inched narrower, one would have much more speed and not much less stability. I am seriously considering an RTM Disco, affordable and fast. But for a 12'6" kayak, the Cayman was fine and I would buy one as a backup if the price is right. If one has trouble tracking in this kayak, consider your paddling style rather than blaming the kayak.
I looked around for another boat looked to Perception and didn't like what I saw, looked at Islander boats, but just didn't like the shape, lack of room, and the flatness of the boat. I also looked at cobra, but didn't like all the hatches, my kahuna had alot of hatches and did they leak!
I was just looking and found my cayman, this was the first boat that I found that I felt comfortable with look wise, shape, depth, and storage. The guy at the shop couldn't give me alot of info so I bought it. I like the boat I paddle the open ocean on a regular basis as well as surf when it's good and have even done some flat water paddling and didn't have any problems. Over all I like the boat I bought. I know this may sound alittle silly but the color is really cool!GIS System

We had no idea the marathon would be going on while we were there, and I was worried at first about getting around with all the traffic/barricades from the marathon. But as it turned out, the marathon basically just followed the path along the river, and once we got north of the river after breakfast, we never saw any traffic or anything from the marathon again. They had designated places to cross the marathon, so we only had to walk a little bit out of our way after breakfast to get back across the river. It was neat to see everything all set up for the race!
On Sunday morning after brunch, we decided to do some sight-seeing around London. It was a gorgeous, sunny, warm day, with hardly a cloud in the sky.
We strolled through Trafalgar Square.
And saw Big Ben in the background.
We walked through Leicester Square.
And explored China Town.
I love seeing all the traditional-style pubs we came across in London.
We ran around Piccadilly Circus, and then made our way to Burlington Arcade, a long, indoor passageway lined with shops and flooded with natural light coming from the skylights above.
At the end of the arcade, we found Laduree Macarons! Swoon! Since we knew we’d be going to the Laduree in Paris, we only got a few to try here. A full report on the Laduree in Paris to come soon!! :) Here we got vanilla, chocolate, and Strawberry Candy. The vanilla and chocolate were just a really good vanilla and chocolate. The strawberry candy was filled with a strawberry marshmallow fluff!! Loved all three, they are all a must!! ;)
Loved this cute little store!
That font! Those colors!
After a fun morning exploring London, we were ready for scones, sandwiches, and afternoon tea at Fortnum and Mason. I’ll be doing a separate post of “Everything I Ate In London,” (just like I did with Scotland) so stay tuned for that! Be sure to subscribe to our email update list so you never miss a post. :)
I was dying over all the fun treats at Fortnum and Mason! How gorgeous are these macarons??
And this rainbow cake stuffed with Skittles? M&Ms?? I have no idea, lol!!
We HAD to try the Chocolate and Salted Caramel Cronuts!! LOVED them! They were so buttery and crisp! These have been my favorite out of all the cronuts I’ve tried, although in all fairness, I haven’t tried them from Dominique Ansel yet, the creator of the Cronut craze! :)
We got a box of macarons to go :) Here are a few of the flavors we tried and loved:
- Red Velvet
- Neapolitan
- Salted Caramel
- Creme Brûlée
- Vanilla
- Peanut Butter
- Brownie
More to come soon!! Thanks so much for looking!!

Beautiful pics! That rainbow cake looks so fun! Instant party!
Your trip seems to have been amazing! I would love to try those peanut butter and brownie macaroons!! YUM!!
Those are probably Smarties inside that cake. Smarties are sort of like m&m’s.
Yep smarties..that’s what they have in London..like m&m’s but no red dye
Those Macarons!!! I wish I had a whole box of them! Oh my lord and the Salted Caramel Cronuts……….. let me have one! haha
Great pictures! Love seeing these – makes me want to hurry and go back someday soon!
Gorgeous photos!! I am dying over those cronuts! Looking forward to your “what I ate in London” post!
A trip to London and Liverpool (huge Beatles fans) is on our short list for 2015! Laduree are my most-favorite macarons on the planet. Haven’t had them in Paris, but have had them in New York. Swoon is indeed correct!
Amanda, I will be going to London for my honeymoon in September. I have loved reading along with all your posts and checking out what you did. It has helped me plan mine! I did have the cronuts on my must try list. Are those from Fortnum and Mason?
Yes they are!!! :) They are definitely a must!! ;)
I always love reading your travel posts. They make me want to jump on a plane right now and go and travel the world!!
Though i have been to London many times, there are always new places to explore. So love reading these finds. I’ll be going next week again, so my question where did you have the cronuts. Dont wanne miss those!By Priscilla Parish Williams
This week marked the 40th anniversary of the U.S. Supreme Court's Roe v. Wade decision legalizing abortion. In a special 1977 issue of Southern Exposure magazine on women, Priscilla Parish Williams wrote a story about organizing underway in the South at the time to once again make abortion illegal. It included a sidebar titled "The Cases of Jane Roe and Mary Doe," which we reprint here in honor of the 40th anniversary of the magazine, which is published by the Institute for Southern Studies, the nonprofit that also publishes Facing South. Titled "Generations: Women in the South," the issue also included stories by noted writers Alice Walker and Lee Smith, as well as Pauli Murray, a civil rights activist and the first black woman ordained as an Episcopalian priest. It is available online here.
In the spring of 1970, two pregnant Southern women were prohibited from obtaining abortions. Mary Doe -- as she was known to the court -- was a married woman from Georgia. According to the records of Doe v. Bolton, "She had three living children. Two had been placed in a foster home because of her poverty and inability to care for them. The youngest had been placed for adoption. Her husband had recently abandoned her and she was forced to live with her indigent parents and their eight children.... She had been a mental patient in the State Hospital."
The other -- known by another pseudonym, Jane Roe -- was an unmarried woman in Texas. She was unable to get an abortion in the state because her life was not threatened by the continuation of her pregnancy (the only reason for which abortions were allowed in Texas), and she could not afford transportation to one of the few states where safe, legal abortions were available.
The Texas law prohibiting all abortions except those necessary to save a woman's life was typical of the vast majority of state statutes at the time. The Georgia law, passed in 1968 as a so-called "reform" law, prohibited abortion as a general rule, but made exception for cases in which a pregnancy would threaten the life of a woman or "seriously and permanently injure her health," a fetus would be born with a "grave, permanent, and irremediable" defect, or a pregnancy resulted from rape. In an effort to comply with one of the law's procedural requirements, Mary Doe had applied to the Abortion Committee of Atlanta's Grady Memorial Hospital. Her request was denied on the ground that her situation did not fall into any of the categories for which the state law made exceptions.
The two women initiated separate lawsuits culminating January 22,1973, in the Supreme Court's decisions (Roe v. Wade and Doe v. Bolton) in their favor. The Court held that the right of a woman to seek an abortion fell within the constitutional right of privacy, and that in the first trimester of pregnancy, attempts to interfere with a woman's decision to have an abortion were unconstitutional. In the second trimester, states were permitted to make regulations, but only to protect maternal health. In the third trimester, however, states were given authority to restrict abortions if they chose; but even then, the Court ruled, efforts to preserve life and health of a woman should take precedence over those to protect the fetus.There is no direct translation for the word “branding” in Ukrainian.
When representatives for Kryvyi Rih, Ukraine, speak through a translator about branding their city, they simply say “brand,” with a slightly rolled R.
“One of the reasons is nobody has been doing it until recently,” said Andriy Nahornyi, director of Kryvyi Rih’s City Development Institute. When the city of roughly 660,000 needed help with their approach to branding, they turned to an unlikely partner: Regina.
Last week, the city’s economic development team met with representatives from Regina and its Winnipeg-based ad agency, McKim Cringan George, for feedback on the new brand being unveiled. Regina rebranded with McKim’s help in 2008. Like Saskatchewan’s capital, Kryvyi Rih is looking to boost its economy by encouraging investment.
Managers from the two cities were brought together by the Ukraine Municipal Local Economic Development Program, a partnership program funded by Canada’s federal government and carried out by the Federation of Canadian Municipalities. The five-year, $19-million program began in 2010, encourages efforts at economic development through trade in 12 cities in the former Soviet Bloc nation. The program has also helped the city of Zhydachiv repair some of its historic and cultural sites in order to attract tourism, and Nikopol to create a business centre to provide support for small and medium-sized businesses.
“[The officials in Kryvyi Rih] understood that you have a brand regardless of whether you’re actively promoting it or not,” said Nathan Morrison, brand manager at the City of Regina, who has travelled to Ukraine three times since last spring to counsel city officials on the process.
“It’s an industrial city, with over 90 big industrial enterprises located within the city boundaries. And there is a perception that it’s a city with very poor ecology,” Tatiana Pidpalko, head of economic development for Kryvyi Rih, said through a translator.
The marketing campaign will highlight the city’s 16,000 hectares of green space, three theatres, 46 public libraries, museum of local history, and circus, among other attractions.
The rebranding approach developed by the agency is heavily research-driven. It starts by finding out what people say about the city, then narrows down perceptions that need to be addressed and finally captures feedback from focus groups. This method drove Regina’s branding and helped McKim develop a “brand book” with guidelines for future marketing and communications.
“Branding has a pretty big target on it, and it’s really open to a lot of criticism by the public, because people interpret it as you’ve spent all this money on a pretty design,” said Audra Lesosky, director of strategic services at the agency. “But it’s much more than that.”
Regina’s new brand and slogan – “infinite horizons” – was built for a city struggling with population decline and in need of a message that would help to reverse that. According to Census data, Regina’s population grew 8 per cent from 2006 to 2011, slightly ahead of the average 7.4-per-cent growth for all census metropolitan areas. While it’s impossible to say how much of that can be attributed to marketing, Mr. Morrison says the right message can have a positive impact on attracting residents and businesses to a municipality.
Kryvyi Rih’s new logo is based on the Cossack gunpowder horn already in the city crest, redrawn with layers of colour to represent the layers of red earth exposed during the mining process. Part of the branding strategy includes operational goals to improve the city – especially environmental goals, given its industrial footprint. Those include bringing in a regulatory framework for environmental protection, modernizing its recycling programs, and replacing outdoor lighting with LED bulbs. To modernize its industry, the city plans to establish a research centre in metallurgy, and create more research and development centres through public-private partnerships.
The new slogan, “Life Long City,” is a play on Kryvyi Rih’s long and narrow shape and, on a figurative level, a suggestion that the city has something for residents at every stage of life. The city has made its own brand book, based on the one that guided Regina’s branding effort.
Ms. Lesosky calls the new brand “dynamic” and “multi-layered.”
“In Ukraine, no one does this professionally. It’s a very new skill. That’s why the Canadian help was so valuable,” Mr. Nahornyi said.Be prepared to wear your heart (and lungs) on your sleeve as you

The monthly labour ministry data is the most frequently reported domestic jobs indicator in France, although it is not prepared according to widely used ILO standards.
Six months from a presidential election at which polls suggest Socialist Francois Hollande could easily defeat President Nicolas Sarkozy, the grim outlook for the job market bodes badly for consumer spending, the traditional engine of French growth.
It is also a blight on Sarkozy's 2007 campaign pledge to create jobs, which was derailed by the global economic crisis, and the government's more recent goal to bring unemployment to below 9 percent by the end of 2011.
Under International Labour Organisation (ILO) accounting, the unemployment rate in mainland France dipped in the second quarter to 9.1 percent from 9.2 percent in the previous three months.
The rate peaked in the wake of the financial crisis at a 10-year high of 9.6 percent in the fourth quarter of 2009.
The figures look set to worsen as the government prepares to cut its 2012 economic growth forecast of 1.75 percent to bring it more in line with analyst estimates at around 1 percent.
In its latest economic outlook the national jobseeking agency, Pole Emploi, forecast that the number of jobseekers would decrease by 5,000 next year if French growth is 1.7 percent after an increase of the same amount this year.
If the economy grows by a lesser 1.4 percent, as the International Monetary Fund has forecast, the number of jobseekers is likely to rise by 12,000, the agency said.
The body that manages France's unemployment insurance, UNEDIC, has painted a gloomier picture, forecasting economic growth of 1.2 percent in 2012 and estimating the number of jobseekers would rise by 55,000.Rain definitely doesn't stop play at top Suffolk venue

Thorpeness in Suffolk is a true all-year rounder as Today’s Golfer discovered at the end of another rain-soddened week.
The fast-draining James Braid heathland coastal layout was not only open but in remarkably good condition despite the latest downpours. No wonder the course was busy with golfers flocking from neighbouring counties in order to stay on course during this wettest of winters.
Thorpeness (pictured), it seems, is winter-proof: the combination of a micro-climate in which it sits and sandy soil conditions make it an excellent winter course – it has only closed for around eight days in the last five years!
The area benefits from one of the lowest rainfall rates in the UK - Suffolk’s annual rainfall is generally as little as one fifth of that in the West Country and only half that of the South Coast. The county has an excellent sunshine record when compared to the rest of the UK enjoying around two hours more sunshine per week than the national average.
Indeed in 2009 Suffolk was the driest part of the UK with a mere 22.5mm of rain in August.
So if you’re looking for a guaranteed game and to warm up for the new season in style head for this corner of East Anglia and Thorpeness in particular. We did and not only had a round to remember, but incredibly came off the course without a splash of mud in sight!
The course is one of the stars of the popular 2-FORE!-1 Golf scheme and also boasts an on-site hotel offering excellent accommodation and dining options. You can check out the latest offers at
One of the most popular stay and play breaks is the Suffolk Ale and Golf Trail package which includes two nights’ B&B and two rounds of golf, evening meal and a choice of brewery tour between the Green Jack Brewery and Adnams.

On The Sexual History of Jared Sabbagh, Part 1
Give me more!
In my opinion, shame is the most unhealthy feeling to have about early sexual experiences, especially when you were a kid and didn't really know what you were doing other than it felt naughty and exciting.
I'm glad Jared was forthright about facts that he may have felt ashamed about when he was younger. Reading his story is probably healthy for anyone else who feels ashamed about what they experienced as a child and I'd like to see more honest discussion about it, it being a high sexual drive from childhood as well as differing sexualities and I think it's a good counterpoint to the interviews with virgins/asexual people.

@rimy And if I can overshare...
So she actually lost her virginity to a random German guy who was preying upon an event for the study abroad students.
And it did not sound pleasant although she was proud of herself for the cold, clinical way she went about the business of getting laid.
Like, apparently it wasn't just p in v. There was also a blowjob and anal sex. On her first time. And neither party came. There was a condom though! :/
When she told me, I didn't want to react badly because I didn't want her to feel bad about sex or be scarred. She seemed very very OK with it but she is also an expert at disguising how she really feels/not acknowledging emotions. But... I was shocked and did feel bad about it, that she couldn't have lost it in a kinder, gentler, more affectionate way.
You guys :( :( :(
I shared a room with her growing up and she is my closest sister and I had huge influence over her but now she is on her own and won't listen to me. I want her to make her own decisions and learn things by herself, but she is doing a bunch of crazy stuff and is really insecure and is being all denial-y. Sigh. I guess she will figure it all out as she grows up.

@Miss Maszkerádi I would agree with you (I have been to Japan and seen HUGE cultural insensitivity from Americans, it was disgusting, shout out to you, mouth-breathing skinny white dude who was loudly bragging about all the hot Japanese chicks he has banged in the middle of a quiet, traditional restaurant >:|)
BUT she is talking about something different and more benign and I do understand to some extent (shout out to Becky from study abroad in Spain who got blackout drunk trashed and made out with tons of ugly dudes who were taking advantage of her every night. She would go home with them which freaked me out because what if they were creeps or murderers or etc). Anyway, I think that there are plenty of girls who do this - get drunk, make out with dudes, dress up, do the "you look so cute!" "I love your shoes!" without really meaning it thing, and who just want to have loud, clubby fun. I get that my sister was like "whoa, I'm so not into this."
BUTTT she is being a huge ass about it. In terms of judging the crap out of them and acting superior. I wish I could copy/paste excerpts of her terrible bitchy/super-defensive emails but it's on my work email.
@all -- Great ideas! I think I'm just gonna let her ride this one out though. I told her that if she substituted 'black' or 'women' for where she mentioned 'typical American girls', her emails would sound like a hugely racist/sexist diatribe.
I used to say things similar to what she is saying now and was surprised when someone got pissed off that I was dissing Americans, seeing as I am American myself. It's like if someone says something racist to you, expecting you'll agree with them, but they are surprised when you're like "uhhh... yeah. Ok, see ya."
I'm sure she will figure it out someday. I wish she was more confident in herself but she has hangups about her femininity/how her face looks, even though she is beautiful and has a bangin' body.
PLUS she totally slept with a random German guy, so all the slut-shaming... I am side-eyeing that like crazy.

This photo has been viewed 7<<- Do you see yourself working in any particular mural tradition? I have spent a lot of time on the West Coast, so I have seen a ton of “political” murals in what I would call a “Latin American” or “Xican@” style, for lack of a better word. I have seen a ton of graffiti all over the world, too. I lived in New York City for five years. I have seen Diego Rivera’s work in Mexico, San Francisco, and Detroit–I’d call those “labor murals,” again, for lack of a better word. Which school of muraling does this mural belong to, from your point of view?
- Who are some of your influences? How does this work compare to theirs?
- Was this commissioned? Who commissioned it?
- How did you decide on the imagery and text? Did that come from your funders or did you have a part in that decision-making?
- What do the words “Inspired,” “Hip,” “Tasty,” “Funky,” and “Savvy” mean to you? [In retrospect, I would add, “How might those words be represented visually?”]
- Do the patterns/lines/colors come from any particular school? Do they have any meaning? For example–what do the stars represent? Why the sun?
My email was dated April 10. As of May 14, I have seen no reply. In the meantime, I have rediscovered this mural, on the side of the Midtown Art Center on Holman @ La Branch.
I believe that one is by Floyd Newsum and I’ve always thought the lady who’s face is depicted is supposed to be Emma Goldman, but I’m just guessing on both counts. In any case, THAT is a good mural to represent Houston. Why? It depicts the nearby freeway (288) that rent this neighborhood in two! And we ALL know that the freeways are simultaneously the most beautiful yet ugly features of this sprawling metropolis. Where do you go to catch a killer view of the skyline like in the HOU mural? To a freeway overpass, where else?
Going back to that nothing mural and the the random words and this whole vapid “Houston is Inspired!” campaign…I hate to quote Margaret Thatcher (this hurts me more than it hurts you), but as Maggie once said, “Power [or “inspiration” or “savviness” or whathaveyou] is like being a lady; if you have to say you are, you aren’t” (emphasis mine).
So settle down and take a deep breath, Houston, then take a cue from South Dakota. If your self-worth is contingent on what national bloggers are writing about you, you are looking for inspiration in all the wrong funky places.
I don’t know if Gonzo247 came up with those words or not, but to me they sound like the result of a brainstorming session at an ad agency. And that ain’t good.
Ironic, isn’t it? Usually I expect the “hive mind” to be more creative and better at problem-solving than the individual mind, but that “truth” rarely translates to the realm of aesthetics.
In one of the recent articles about Houston being the hip new destination, they credited the city for the “Houston. It’s Worth It.” campaign. As we all know, the city didn’t come up with that fantastic and highly successful campaign — an independent creative firm, Ttweak, did.
Rule #1 in business: surround yourself with people who do things better than you do. The city should have hired Ttweak to do the branding that they are clearly incapable of doing themselves. “Houston is Inspired” (which has been panned in art circles) is the latest half-baked effort in the grand tradition of “Houston: It’s Hot!” and “My Houston”. How many times does the GHCVB need to fall on its face for someone wielding the levers of branding power to take the job away from them?
“Fantastic and highly successful?” By what metric?
I can’t tell if you are being sincere or sarcastic. What I do know is that BRANDING is something that is done to livestock and chattel slaves, and no thank you–I will pass on being branded. I will, however, continue to invite and host the people that I love to my hometown, despite bullshit like this, because this bullshit is really just the tip of the funky iceturd, if you follow. We’s WAY funkier ‘neath the surface, and it’s high time we embraced it.
Oh wait, sorry, you are referring to the “HIWI” campaign, not the “Houston is” campaign. I still stand by what I said, though–who are the people who actually pay attention to these campaigns, and how many of them are swayed by them?
I can tell you this–the people who pay attention to and are swayed by bollocks like this do not carry much, if any, “cultural capital.” They are not the sought-after hubs or influential people or whatever the marketers call them. They are not the influential trend-setters–people like that see right through this kind of empty rhetoric and are more likely turned off than turned on by it. I know, because I am someone whose opinion people seek when looking for stuff to do and places to go. (Not to toot my own horn, and like I said, I will continue to sell Houston despite these bollocks, because Houston is way cooler than GHVCB even knows.)
Robert is correct that Gonzo has become the puppet for a dim marketing bureau. Gonzo is both a nice guy and prolific illustrator, but not very interesting as an artist. But I have no beef with Gonzo, I hope they paid him well for this inconsequential psychedelia.
Let us return to the core of the issue, Houston cheerleaders are Insipid.
There in the Houston Chronicle I see a turgid James Rodriguez on a scissor lift next to Gonzo. Keep it up James, we guarantee the votes will flood through like nocturnal emissions.
This question should be posed to the Greater Houston Convention and Visitors Bureaus: Why litter us with inanity? And next time could you offer the brainstorming session to some people who did not study marketing? If you want people to celebrate Houston, then we should display some complexity.
I should not be so perturbed by the Greater Houston Convention and Visitors Bureaus, I know they are a provincial propaganda department for a humid city with broken roads and a toy tram called lite rail. The point is, secretly I am a Nepotist and my friends could do better.
I love Houston too, such ambivalence…oh well.
Right. Who are the people consulted by GHVCB in their focus-groups? What questions did GHVCB ask them?
I get your ambivalence–I think it’s a function of complexity.
Thank God! I’m so happy to FINALLY see an intelligent response to this vapid mural and ridiculous slogan!
Really, Houston, what has happened that we are praising this garbage just because we want to show support for the artist? This mural and the city’s reaction to it highlight the art community’s largest problem at the moment; lack of critical writing and discussion around the art being created here.
Thank you, Harbeer, for writing this. I hope more people see it.
Thank you for your reply, Kelly. I agree that we need to raise the bar and expect more from ourselves and those who would claim us for their audience. I’m glad to do my part, but we’re all in this together!
I imagine that it’s purpose is to be a “snapshot” for the big tourism push Houston is going to be unleashing. I can see the mural being background or a visual in brochures and hotel information guides now… its a commercial, not an artisitc statement.
wow, the women’s building in san fran looks amazing! there are some really powerful murals that i’ve seen in philly as well. i think my major critique of the houston mural is that it SAYS houston. murals should speak for themselves. adding words to them really takes away from the message (though I didn’t really even get what the message was in this case). so my comment isn’t totally negative…i will say that this wall would be great to look at while on a shrooms induced journey. amiright?.”
And this mural is, as others have pointed, the outcome of Gonzo247’s patronage. And of course it’s circumscribed by the wishes of Houston’s tourism bureau and the downtown management district and whatever other entity is paying for all the paint. Houston’s got this whole glossy campaign featuring our celebrity chefs and our linebackers and our Rice Village boutique owners, the kind of campaign that you see in in-flight magazines, and now it’s got a street-level billboard, too.
So maybe it fails on that level.
But I would say that you don’t have to go to Venice Beach or San Francisco to see murals that work in the terms you lay out here. The East End is full of them. There’s Leo Tanguma’s crumbling, crackling block-long mural on Canal St. — it’s amazing. The scale of it. And it’s so violent and so fraught with the story of the U.S.-Mexico border, with all the arms desperately reaching and the figures stepping on the skulls of their ancestors, that it resonates — even with me, a white guy from the Midwest.
And if you drive up and down Harrisburg Blvd., you’ll see several others that are representative of that neighborhood’s working-class history: You’ll see freight trains and roosters and cargo ships and refinery smokestacks.
There’s one thing I’m wondering at, though. The murals you (and I both) bring up as successful examples are representational. And this one’s clearly abstract. Same with Daniel Anguilu’s work in Midtown. Would it be possible to critique an abstract mural on these same grounds? Could you say that Anguilu’s work doesn’t capture the past or the future of Houston?
I’m interested to hear what you all have to say about that.
Absolutely, Allyn, we have great murals all over town, especially the East End, and I am also a fan of Leo Tanguma’s huge, crackling mural. I tried, however, in this post, to limit my discussion to murals which could be said to represent whole cities, rather than certain segments of their populations, exclusively. (I did cheat a little by mentioning the Women’s Building mural, but only because it’s my all-time favorite, and even then, I give the reader links rather than images.)
You raise a good question about representation, though. Again, since we’re talking about civic-themed murals, I almost think that it would have to be representational. That said, I am a big fan of Daniel Anguilu and his abstract styles. (And that said, I would not place so much import on my own subjective tastes to use whether I “like” or “dislike” a work as the only yardstick by which I measure any given work.)
Could Anguilu capture the past or future of Houston? I wouldn’t put it past him–but I wouldn’t put it past Gonzo, either, if he were liberated from the dictates of focus-groups and committees and given free reign to make his own aesthetic choices.
Check out this video I co-produced with Mark Armes on Daniel Anguilu:
Pingback: When is a Mural just a Billboard? | The Texas Observer
Everyone please revisit what remains of Leo Tanguma’s ‘The Rebirth of Our Nationality’ on the massive former Continental Can Company Building on Canal Street … now THAT’s a mural!
I agree–that is a great mural and I wanted to include it in this discussion but in the end I chose to limit my discussion to murals which can be said to represent a whole city.
I will probably do a whole post on just Tanguma’s mural in the near future–I’ve already got great photos of it. (I wish the mural was in as good shape as my photos, though.)
Have you seen this piece of crap?
A lazy formalist reading for Allyn West.
All lines are hard edge, the preferred mark making for a mediocre spray painter. The colors are predictably saturated. The psychedelic bands converge at the center, focusing our attention at the words “Houston inspired hip tasty funky savvy” and the baby bottle skyline above it. The baby bottles have a halo above, exerting more focus toward the center and reminding us of our happy city. It would be generous to call this mural child’s play. I could go on, but I can’t be bothered.
I’m going to go out on a limb and respond to your post here… not necessarily out of defensiveness or because I disagree with many of your points, but because I feel context is important to understand how all this came about and how we might approach the question of promoting Houston in better ways in the future.
First, let’s address the need to promote Houston: This is a tough one. How to do it effectively? One of the things I find so enchanting about Houston is that it defies categorization. Off the top of my head, the words I most associate with Houston are: diverse, ephemeral, frontier, sprawling… but the best most of us can agree upon is that it’s hot, humid, and gridlocked. We love to complain about our city, and frankly, that’s OK. I firmly believe the Tweak/HIWI guys handled it best in their “Houston, It’s Worth It” efforts years ago (), but sadly, HIWI didn’t have much of a shelf-life outside a niche community and even sadder, not everyone appreciated the wry take on the best/worst our city had to offer. However, HIWI was never going to be a means to draw tourists to Houston and that remains a goal. Why should the art community be invested in that goal? Because it is the hotel occupancy tax (HOT funds) that go towards public funding for the arts in Houston via the Houston Arts Alliance. (And before we go down the rabbit hole debate of public funding for the arts, let me say that the art community will always complain about how there’s never enough funding, how it’s too hard to obtain, how it’s going to the wrong people/groups, etc…. and yet, I’d argue that we, as a sector, are likely better off having at least the opportunity to receive those funds than otherwise.) So, aside from investing in an even more vibrant art scene (which I’d argue is goal numero uno), how do we attract tourists? If not a fan of the GHCVB, can you get on board with their ultimate goal?
On to the backstory on the campaign (and by campaign, I mean the glossy images you may or may not have seen utilizing these “hip, tasty, inspired” words): the GHCVB’s research informed them that, in our region, Houston owns the categories of cuisine and culture. Whether anyone else agrees or not, that is what their research is saying today in 2012/2013. So, the GHCVB invested substantial time and energy in finding a way to brand Houston on a national level as the culture and food capitals of the region via a series of national print ads… primarily in the Times and Journal. I won’t discuss the descriptors used in the tagline (hip, tasty, inspired, etc.), but I’ll share my personal opinion of the images. While being gorgeous photographs and featuring some of my favorite local celebrities, my first reaction was uncertainty they were an effective way to engage interest from a largely unfamiliar audience on the other side of the country. (The ad campaign targeted a few key cities like NYC and DC.) While undoubtedly attractive, the images strike me as fairly generic and failing to capture Houston’s flavor. That said, the GHCVB assured us that they had extensively tested the ads and they had been met with overwhelming praise (from an unaffiliated audience)… so at some point, despite my own misgivings, I had to accept that perhaps I was in the minority and the ads would perform decently. (I still completely agree about the unnecessary and unsophisticated details like the top hat on the “hip” text and the spark in the “tasty” text… but you know what they say about opinions and assholes!) In any case, here’s the big takeaway: the GHCVB is investing considerable resources in branding Houston as a food and culture capital. That means they are marketing US… not energy, not real estate, not sports… US. I hope the art community will see value in that, regardless of the tactics… tactics we will NEVER agree upon, nor should we.
As for the Chron article, a few members of art community (namely HAA and the leaders of the museum and theatre districts) thought it a good idea to piggyback on the GHCVB’s national efforts and to create a local campaign to raise awareness of our arts scene. That is why you may see/hear “Houston is Inspired” pulled from the GHCVB’s original efforts quoted over and over again. Once others (like myself) got involved, it was determined that the first simple goal was an effort to unite the art community in one message to spark conversation about what excites us about our art scene. The two big challenges here are: a) the inevitable criticism of the slogan de jour and b) how to give any campaign legs beyond the predictable cheering section.
Here’s how entities like the GHCVB (and everyone involved in the campaign) are fighting an uphill battle: their primary points of contact are the biggest institutions in the city and they are obligated to serve such a broad audience that hands are tied when it comes to the most edgy or exciting marketing campaigns. I wish (and here’s my optimism and naiveté showing), instead of dismissing them as insipid, we could open up a dialogue about different tactics. I know there are at least a handful of people in the room (myself included) who are interested in what independent artists have to say about these marketing efforts. What are some better ideas? If you were to market Houston’s art scene outside the city (or even inside the city), how would you recommend doing it? I’ll admit I’m constantly frustrated by the siloing of the art community– particularly between independent artists and our institutions. A degree of tension is natural (and perhaps valuable to keep us all on our toes), but at some point, the “us against them” attitude grows tiresome and counterproductive. But is there value in uniting and collaborating? You tell me.
On to the mural: I think your criticizing ANY mural for its aesthetic value is totally valid. I think there needs to be more constructive criticism of work in this city, and I think everyone (independent artists and institutions alike) should be primed to receive it. But it’s helpful to know the story of the mural’s creation and it’s role as a tangible marker of the GHCVB’s campaign. Calling it a billboard may not be unjustified… but I love Gonzo247 to death and I think, in this case, he did exactly what he was commissioned to do. We can debate the mural’s value (and I think you offered some very constructive points if this was approached as a self-generated or community-responsive work of art), but the reality is that many, many people genuinely loved it. (Tangentially, I’m glad your post has sparked conversation about other murals around town in the comments… just so you all know, HAA is working on a public art database as we speak. Many believe murals and other street art should be a part of that… so now is the time to let your voice be known. And loudly.)
Lastly, your Margaret Thatcher quote… “if you have to say you are, you aren’t.” Believe me, that same quote was echoed around the room repeatedly during discussions of this campaign, and the sentiment was not lost on key figures at the GHCVB itself. But context plays a big role here. So, the questions remain: do we participate in the conversation and efforts? Do we offer better alternatives… and when we disagree or are outvoted, do we participate anyways? Do we independently initiate our own bold efforts? Or do we criticize amongst ourselves? These are not rhetorical questions. Let’s discuss.
Hi Jenni,
First of all, thank you for all the work you do in our arts community. It’s awesome and it’s crucial and I totally appreciate it, as do all the local artists that we know in common. Thank you, also, for your very thorough and thoughtful comment, patience, and willingness to engage. Ironically, if more arts administrators were like you (soliciting feedback and engagement), then we probably would not even be having this discussion.
That said, now please don’t be offended, but my initial reaction to your comment was “tl;dr.” I don’t say this to be mean or snarky, but because I am trained in post-structuralist criticism and, as a critic, I am not the least bit concerned with authorial/artistic intent (“the intentional fallacy”) but only in “the text,” the object. (And when I say “text” in this context, I mean the whole mural, not just the words on the mural.)
The back-story is predictable. I think we all know what happened. It was a series of aesthetic decisions made by a committee–a committee where commercial interests and politicians held most of the clout, I’m guessing–and the result is likewise predictable. It’s safe. In attempting to please everybody and offend nobody, it makes for something…meh. (And some people are indeed pleased, and very few people are offended, so, on those levels, you could call it a success. My sincere congratulations to everybody involved–I accept that I am not the target audience for this mural.)
BUT, I am not just a critic. I am also a proud Houstonian and a working artist in this city, so I am invested in its future and its culture. In that capacity, I respect and appreciate you as an ally and I will do my best to respond to your questions and the issues you raise, after I get all these disclaimers out of the way: I am but one man; I don’t claim to have all the answers; I remain hopeful and open-minded, and I say all these things in the spirit of humility and civic-minded helpfulness, not to score sarcastic points.
But I’m going to be blunt now, because I think our city needs that I and I know that we can handle it. I’ll respond in the order that you raise the issues.
You say we have a need to promote Houston. I do not accept that as a given. I, personally, do not feel that need, but if that is the priority of FreshArts and the Greater Houston Visitors and Convention Bureau (Who REALLY need to reevaluate their name and acronym–what a mouthful of consonants!) then I think you are putting the cart before the horse.
The cliché goes, “If you build it, they will come,” not “If you hype it, they will come.”
Let’s pause for a moment for a recent article on Tijuana’s artist-led, artist-funded cultural renaissance:
GHVCB works with trade groups to bring conventions to Houston, and I’m sure they do a great job of it. But put yourself in the shoes of a convention visitor who books a hotel downtown. Let’s say they get a place at the Hilton or the Four Season near Discovery Green. At the end of their day, what do they see? Downtown is a veritable ghost town, and there is no way to get out, except for a rental car or a taxi, and we all know how great cab service is here. Convention at the Galleria or the Energy Corridor? Even worse.
You can get those visitors here once, but will they come back? And what will they tell their friends, coworkers, and neighbors when they go back home? When they return to where they come from, are they going to encourage others to come to Houston, or are they going to say, “It’s weird, man. There’s nobody on the streets after 5 pm. You can’t get anywhere without a car, and that’s if you can even figure out where to go.”
If attracting visitors is the goal, then I say let’s prioritize some infrastructure, first. Two needs: public transportation and public space. Have you read Philip Lopate’s article “Pursuing the Unicorn: Public Space in Houston?” It was published in CITE magazine in 1984, and it still rings true, it still remains pertinent. It was written during a previous boom-time in our city, when there was much talk of achieving “world class” status. We’re still talking about the same things–so much so that I recently wrote a summary of that article for Free Press Houston.
You mentioned Discovery Green as an unqualified success in one of your Facebook comments. Discovery Green is a pretty great start, but it’s not public space. Public space allows for free speech, but I have never seen a busker in Disco Green. On the other hand, I have seen people kicked out for flyering and I’ve seen GoREALah Soul/You(genius) kicked out for unsanctioned performance. We don’t need to ask for permission to flyer, perform, and speak our minds in public space because it BELONGS TO US.
Disco Green is some kind of public/private partnership, and like GHVCB, the programming they offer is “safe” (read “bland,” for the most part, although we can all think of exceptions). The same goes for Miller Outdoor Theater. Compare the offerings at Disco Green and Miller Outdoor and the International Festival here in Houston with some other free concert series like San Francisco’s Stern Grove Festival or Celebrate Brooklyn at the Prospect Park Bandshell. (Actually, I-Fest isn’t even free–you have to PAY MONEY to see 300 vendors selling the same tapestries and incense.)
I guarantee that there will be children at those concerts in San Francisco and Brooklyn who will hear some swear words and might even see one or two performers grab their crotch. I guarantee that they will not be scarred for life by that, and they will not be at higher risk for STDs or unwanted pregnancies as a result of that. STILL our local arts administrators and decision-makers COWER IN FEAR of boorish, uncultured [hate to say it for the racist connotations but there’s no word that means the same thing] philistines like Wayne Dolcefino. Where were our public intellectuals and arts administrators when Dolcefino ran his smear campaign against HAA? Why did they not stand up to him, tell him to get back to the hole he crawled out from? (I didn’t live here then, and maybe some folks did, in which case I apologize, but someone needs to tell clowns like him that when culture is relevant it is not always pretty, and when it is pretty, well…see the billboard, above.)
And it’s not just in reaction to the Wayne Dolcefinos that we, as a city, self-censor and neuter ourselves. Last fall I worked on a self-styled flea market/concert/circus event. I wanted to hire a pole dancer to perform because I think they do amazing athletic things–I think we may see pole dancing as an Olympic sport some time in the near future–but the event owners were afraid of offending parental sensibilities because (to them) pole dancing is associated with strip clubs. Talk about insulting your audience! Personally, I think the owners of that event exaggerated the “conservatism” of their potential audience. (Their event fell through and never happened, so it’s likely you never even heard about it.)
Can we put our big boy pants on now, please? Will somebody please tell these people that, in a democracy, you have a lot of rights and with those rights come responsibilities but nobody has the right to never be offended? I am offended by the statues of GHW Bush and James Baker downtown but I deal with them. I am offended by not one but multiple giant crosses on my skyline, but I deal with them. I am offended by before-and-after liposuction billboards but I deal with them. If I had kids, I might point to those billboards as a “teachable moment” about consumerism and healthy vs. unhealthy choices, and as a writer of satirical fiction, I am grateful to have such an easy target to lampoon.
Boy, am I off-topic! Or am I? Sorry, I’m rambling, let me get back to your comment.
You say, “it is the hotel occupancy taxes that go towards public funding for the arts in Houston.” This is why we should support increased tourism to Houston, in your opinion. I’m sorry, but could you walk me through this, please?
I get the party line. I’ve won one of those HAA individual artist grants, and I gave that spiel about how my work would draw tourists here, but let’s be honest, what would this look like?
Are you suggesting that collectors are coming from New York and LA and Milwaukee and Boise to buy local art from galleries? And they’re staying at hotels on these buying trips, and thus pumping money into the local economy?
Are you saying that theater and/or orchestral audiences are flying in from far-flung places to attend events at Jones Hall and the Wortham?
That is a ridiculous assertion. Those collectors may exist, but any local artist who is attracting collectors from those places is going to have gallery representation IN THOSE PLACES. And nobody is flying anywhere to see a touring production of a Broadway show or a revival or something like the Philip Glass doing Dracula that I saw at Jones Hall for a lot of money last week which will be presented for free at the Prospect Park Bandshell this summer.
But maybe you are thinking more of regional tourists–people from Katy and Waller and the Woodlands and Baytown and Angleton. I have no doubt that the Houston arts scene brings people from around the region into town, but I doubt they stay to spend the night in hotels. I suppose there’s self-justifying studies that might prove my assumption incorrect, but I really think that’s a stretch.
Neither of these–not the big national collectors and curators nor the regional art aficionados (day trippers) amount to a significant hotel guest population in Houston. There’s just no way. I don’t even see the possibility. (Sex-workers also rent hotel rooms, so…?)
You know who draws a significant number of out-of-towners? Free Press Summer Fest, but they don’t even benefit from the HOT taxes–they PAY the city permitting fees rather than take money from the city.
I have benefitted from the HAA grant program, but I would have done my same work whether I’d gotten funded or not, because I am an artist–that’s what I do.
On to your second point: I don’t see the value in empty hype–I think it can do more damage than good. I have a friend who puts on a “rock and roll circus.” I was even part of the first one and invited to be part of the second but I was out of town the second time around. To call that event a “circus” is a bald-faced lie. It is not a circus, it is local bands performing in circus costumes.
Likewise, for Gonzo to call his commercial illustration “Aerosol Warfare” is a bit of a stretch. I get that “bombing” means to cover a wall in paint, and there is a bomb in the logo, but doesn’t the name beg the question, “If you are a warrior, then which side are you on?” The side of monied interests and commercial illustration, clearly. (I really don’t want to harp on Gonzo too much, because I honestly like and respect the guy, sincerely, but it’s strange for someone who does work-for-hire to sign their work. I’ve done copywriting for at least one client that I share in common with Gonzo, and my name does not appear on that work.)
Compare that to the Precita Eyes Muralists in San Francisco, who work with at-risk youth to teach them not just art, but also self-respect in a world which is geared to drive them into the ground. And their art is dope! Have you walked down Balmy Alley in San Francisco’s mission district? Wow–that is good stuff.
Again, I’m not saying any of these things to diss anybody, but I feel like we use words without thinking through their meanings, and that can start to feel like empty hype. I know what a good “alternative” circus looks like–I’ve seen Bindlestiff and Mystic Family and Teatro Zinzanni and the Bask Festival and a host of others that I can’t think of right now (some of which were just ad hoc freakshows with no name)–this local show that I’m talking about really should not be promoting itself as a “circus” unless it seriously levels-up its game.
I want to back up to your question about “How do we increase tourism?” Again, that is not a goal of mine–I don’t necessarily see the value in that–but I do want my out-of-town friends to visit me more.
It used to be that if/when I wanted to visit my people in other parts of the country or even the world, I would have to save up and plan to go visit them. I felt like I had nothing to offer them here. That has changed in recent years. I have entertained many of my dearest friends in Houston, and shown them a great time, and my friends tend to be world travelers belonging to a discriminating audience. I am excited to host my friends and family in Houston for the first time in my life!
Those friends go home and tell their friends, and because these relationships are based on trust and shared tastes and values, this “hype” means a lot more than any manufactured hype from GHVCB, whom we all know gets paid to generate hype. That is organic. That is real. It takes a lot more time than one fiscal cycle and it’s much harder to quantify, but that’s the only real way to accomplish your stated goal of increasing tourism.
And as for all these other necessary cultural changes, I’ll leave you with a message of hope and empowerment. We, as artists, have the power to change the culture; we have the power to influence people’s values. Let’s do that. Let’s be ambitious and expect more from ourselves, and let’s hold each other accountable and expect more from each other.
To that end, I think good criticism is a crucial ingredient, and I hope that I can do my small part in that. Let’s stop patting each other on our backs for phoning in a mediocre job. Let’s demand excellence.
If we build it, they will come.
Any and all responses are welcome. Oh, and here’s one more great article you should read about the power of mutual aid in an arts scene:
And here are some alternative slogans I’ve come up with:
And let’s give some credit to our experimental/avant garde/noise music scenes. We are world-renown for that, too, and fittingly so. As Leonard Cohen sings of Port Arthur’s own Janis Joplin, “We are ugly, but we have the music.”
Humble apologies for any offense.
Harbeer, supposing I might be offended is supposing I disagree with many of your points… I do not. I am merely approaching the issue from a different angle, as someone who has– for whatever reason– been let in the room to see how these things happen. As I said in my last reply and will repeat here, I absolutely agree that criticism is a crucial ingredient in our approach to demand better. I may, however, question the means, venues, and spirit in which it is sometimes posed. We can challenge the tactics, but I can’t fault our city’s cheerleaders for their intention… they are not the city planners, but are merely doing their job with the tools currently at their disposal and through the filter of their perspective. You aptly recognize the issue is much deeper and more complicated.
You also echoed my sentiment (“goal numero uno”) about prematurely prioritizing the promotion of Houston over an investment in infrastructure and cultural life. No argument there. But again, that part is not necessarily the GHCVB’s job… that responsibility falls elsewhere– on our city’s institutions and artists, as well as the leadership who can/should/do champion us.
In regards to tourists, I agree with you 100% about the average tourist rendered unable to truly appreciate what Houston has to offer due to a lack of infrastructure and public space. Honestly, what troubles me even MORE is that the same applies to the average Houstonian… those who may have ventured to Discovery Green or the International Fest, but have never attended (or heard of) the Menil or the Orange Show, for example.
I think your point about Discovery Green as a public space is also very interesting, and I’d love to discuss with the powers that be. It’s tough to be at the helm of a large (substantially) publicly-funded entity which ostensibly caters to all walks of life. But given who is at the helm (people formerly affiliated with some of the more visionary projects in Houston’s history), I don’t think your point would be lost on them. But here’s one thing I’d say about Discovery Green: we can agree/disagree about the aesthetics/quality of the programming, but each and every time I visit, I see a genuine reflection of Houston– culturally, socioeconomically, etc. I would challenge you to question whether there’s a difference between self-censoring and aiming to provide an environment which doesn’t alienate. Perhaps we can find a better balance… I won’t argue that.
It’s funny to me that most of the examples you bring up are concerts. As someone who bangs her head against the wall regarding arts marketing, I can tell you that concerts tend to follow entirely different rules, despite having the ability to incorporate art, public engagement, and activism in one tidy/messy experience. (We fret over how to get young professionals to “invest” $50-70 in a ticket to world-renowned productions/performances… but significantly less upwardly mobile kids think nothing of dropping $100+ on FPSF tickets. Is it a question of relevance? I’d love to know.)
You mention Dolcefino… what a damn dolt. I, too, was surprised the art community didn’t come out swinging. I believe the leadership was advised to take the higher ground. But some of us spoke out before we had any real platforms to do so: (At the time, this exchange was picked up by the Chron, but admittedly, 5 years later and hopefully wiser, I’m not sure I would have taken that approach.) But why was Dolcefino’s appeal so scary to the art community? I think it’s because so many fear his sentiments are shared by the bulk of our neighbors. In that way, you’re right that a lot of assumptions are made about what Houston can and cannot handle. One of the biggest convenings of Houstonians– the Art Car parade– is when we wave our freak flag highest. Why, then, are we so afraid? You’re preaching to the choir. (I booked a stripping clown– she hates when I use that description– for some of our public programming.) But this isn’t about congratulating ourselves for our “daring”… this is about asking why “challenging” can’t be an acceptable facet of public art programming in Houston. A valid question.
Now… on the other hand, being culturally relevant doesn’t simply mean exchanging one set of values (bland, safe, approachable) for another (edgy, agit-prop, sensational, risqué). Something genuinely reflective of our city would encompass both– would you not agree?
You pin me down about the HOT funds and party line as though I’m part of the machine and understand the logic… to the contrary, we apply for those grants just as you did. So, yes, we’ve benefited by the existence of those funds– funds which, given our current system, wax and wane with the amount of tourists sleeping in hotel beds in our city. (I make the distinction of sleeping in hotel beds, because the regional tourism you cite does not count.) And we could discuss dozens of different scenarios for why this makes sense or doesn’t make sense, but the fact remains that this is how the system is structured in Houston. Despite the pathetic share of public funds dedicated to culture in Texas, the idea is that we’re lucky to have this system in place to secure what funds we can. (I genuinely believe there are legitimate arguments against tying cultural funding to tourism, as well as challenging public funding for the arts in general– but those are much larger conversations for another time.)
I really respect your putting thought into all the examples of people doing good work in other cities, as well as cool events offered for free. However, we could cherry-pick similar examples in Houston– Phillip Glass for FREE at Menil, etc. I imagine we can find good, bad, and meh most anywhere. With all due respect, it feels a little like comparing apples and oranges. What’s different is perhaps a critical mass, degree of consistency and/or persistence, and general awareness. I would suggest the more important question (pertinent to this discussion) is: who is doing the good work in Houston? Who knows about it and how? What gives it relevance and public value in defining our city? What’s holding them back? What tools and resources are needed to broaden that reach and amplify that voice? And who (or what) can be the enabler?
You’re absolutely right about deep, organic, word-of-mouth engagement– when it comes to tourism or otherwise. The GHCVB knows this as well as we do. But it is their job to employ different tactics that work on a broader spectrum, so I hesitate to crucify them on this altar when some of the fundamental investments you call for need to come from elsewhere. It’s funny… their campaign was discussed at length last night (the Monday morning quarterback contingent has been in full force for weeks!) and the party in question, while disliking the campaign herself, shared that her colleagues (art coterie) from Dallas (perhaps wrong example, I know!) and Chicago LOVED it. There’s no disputing tastes, as they say.
As for your proposed slogans… “unapologetically Houston.” Man, you may jest, but that one hits the nail on the head, doesn’t it?
Let’s continue these conversations. Like I said before, I am CERTAIN there are those who want to hear this.
No, I didn’t want you to be offended that I said that my initial reaction to your comment was “tl;dr” and that I don’t care about yours, Gonzo’s, or GHVCB’s “intentions” or the story of the focus-groups and the making of the mural.
I don’t even know what this means. Are you saying these people are not qualified for their jobs? What are you saying?
Did you read the articles I linked to? I’m not the only one saying this, but we are all being ignored. Phillip Lopate said these things in 1984. Thirty years is a LONG time to still be yelling into the same echo chamber. Too long. Enough excuses. Enough hand-holding and back-patting.
They should start by getting themselves a new acronym. (I hope they don’t have to do a plethora of surveys and focus-groups to do that, though.) How can we trust this agency to promote Houston when their own acronym makes it almost impossible to promote even themselves?
Calling Pat Sajak! I’d like to buy a vowel.
Hear, hear. Improving the quality of life and culture for Houstonions is my priority. The rest will follow naturally, organically from that.
Point taken. I don’t think that every event needs to cater to a broad audience, though. I think a different approach to a similar end would be to have a whole season of programing with events catering to different niche audiences that could conceivably provide more depth and breadth simultaneously.
I am going with what I know, and what I know that people will travel for. I got a HAA individual artist grant in 2010. I would love to think that people would come from far and wide to the public readings I scheduled as part of that, but even on my most delusional days that would be laughable. On the other hand, I have traveled far and wide for concerts and music festivals. I know many people, like me, who have traveled far and wide for concerts and music festivals.
I might go check out the upcoming Turrell show at the Guggenheim this fall, even though it will also show at the MFAH, because I also have friends and family and a client to visit in New York. I would not go to Minneapolis to see that same show in that same space (if that were possible), because I wouldn’t have those additional reasons to go to Minneapolis AND because I don’t have to pay for hotels in New York.
Those are some reasons I bring up concerts–because your stated goal is to generate tourism, and I think concerts have a more legitimate claim to generating tourism than the other arts, including my own, which is literature. Concerts are public events; reading is a private activity.
Fair enough.
Great questions.
I’m serious as a heart attack! I like that one, too. That is a slogan that even I can get behind (and not just because it’s of my coinage). 😉
Hear, hear. We enter very dangerous territory when arts institutions deviate from their missions to promote a city agency’s — in this case, the GHCVB’s — agenda. The Museum of Fine Arts, Houston’s mission, for example, is “excellence in collecting, exhibiting, preserving and interpreting art for all people,” not to “provide the infrastructure to make us the central destination, the hub for all things cultural,” as Gary Tinterow told me. Since I’ve been covering it, the MFAH has all too frequently put the lion’s share of its marketing machine behind rental shows that are essentially rehangs of somebody else’s collection at the expense of its scholarly exhibitions. The fact that I and every other art writer in town wasn’t getting bugged constantly about the recent, phenomenal Jacques Callot survey — the first in 40 years — or Mari Carmen Ramirez’s interesting mash-up of a few Latin American pieces with other parts of the contemporary collection — or Emily Neff and Christine Gervais’s American Made survey — is a travesty.
These were three homegrown shows that should have made us all Houston Proud, to recycle an old slogan, but the MFAH was more concerned with selling Prado and Picasso tickets and presumably helping the GHCVB put heads in beds. Meanwhile, ticketed (and occasionally non-ticketed) shows have taken up space in Upper Beck’s permanent collection galleries for most of the last three years. It was so nice to see the Strauss Collection finally return and some of the great long-term loans — e.g. the Tintoretto — finally return, but what does it say about the MFAH’s opinion of its own collection that it can come down anytime for a ticketed rehang of somebody else’s? And don’t get me starting on rehashing the MFAH’s hideously opaque arrangement with the for-profit organizer of what I really hope will be our last once-in-a-lifetime chance to see artifacts from Tut’s tomb for $33 bucks a pop. Think shows like that build the kind of deep, lasting relationships with the museum that make people want to brag about it to everyone they know? The hell they do. I stood outside Tut interviewing the opening-day visitors. Most had very little familiarity with the MFAH and had no idea until I told them that there was this huge collection they could check out. And LACMA’s experience with its Tut show was that membership jumped so people could save on the tickets, but within three years they had fallen back to their core membership — the base of genuine support that takes longer to build honestly.
Meanwhile, I just got back from the Menil Collection’s shockingly beautiful Byzantine Things in the World exhibition, which has been up since May 3 and which has had no press preview and pretty much the opposite of a barrage of emails, because all the works are drawn from its own holdings — which, you know, happen to be among the best in the world. Ho hum, right? What if we hyped those shows the way we hype the fluff?
I like Unapologetically Houston. I kind of wonder if amending HIWI for cultural tourists (and it does seem that the GHVCB at least knows that most of its tourism will come from within Texas or very nearby) to say Houston. It’s Worth It If You Know Where to Look would work, along with three-bullet checklists (Menil. Margaritas. Mercury Baroque. Houston’s worth it if you know where to look.) Because that’s what I tell people all the time. We’re the opposite of fabulous cities like San Francisco where you notice everything gorgeous and wonderful first and then notice all the horrible stuff.
Hey, how about this? “We don’t make the greatest first impression. Just an unforgettable second one.”
Wow, thank you for this honest, insightful comment, Devon. I am jealous of your knowledge–I want to know all this stuff you know.
This sentence stands out to me, “We’re the opposite of fabulous cities like San Francisco where you notice everything gorgeous and wonderful first and then notice all the horrible stuff.”
My friend Torry puts it this way, “Houston: It’s a great place to live, but I wouldn’t want to visit.”
We are indeed known, even in the “cultural capitals,” for the Menil compound (including the Twomblys and the Rothkos and the Flavins), for screw music and Dirty Third coast rap, for our restaurants (and our waistlines), and for experimental/avant garde music (thank you Pauline Oliveros and David Dove). We used to be a blues town, too, but a lot of those juke joints have closed down (long live the Silver Slipper!) We have long had a somewhat interesting, local, underground visual/performance art scene, but it suffers from too much back-patting and a dearth of constructive criticism compounded by low expectations from both artists and audiences.
But with the exception of the restaurants, these are not what “Houston is Inspired!” is promoting. Like in the examples I gave above, by hyping things that aren’t our strengths and ignoring things which we are actually good it, much of this rings as false-advertising. And as I said above–that might get someone in the door once, but they won’t come back and they’ll discourage others from doing likewise.
I had forgotten “Houston Proud.” There is a whole list of these short-lived slogans that Brad Tyer linked to in his re-blog of this post at the Texas Observer:
I like this dialogue and hope to share it with some of my colleagues… I hope, with your blessings.
I’m going to try not to post a lengthy response again, because I feel this thread could continue forever and that would not be as productive as opening up the conversation in a public forum. (I’m all for identifying the “actionable!”)
I have to take issue with your closing remarks: “But with the exception of the restaurants, these are not what “Houston is Inspired!” is promoting. Like in the examples I gave above, by hyping things that aren’t our strengths and ignoring things which we are actually good it, much of this rings as false-advertising.”
I’m unclear what you mean. For example, you mention the Menil as an example of what is good, but suggest it doesn’t seem to be at the heart of the “Houston is inspired” campaign… which is incorrect. One of the key images of this campaign was taken… at the Menil. That wasn’t an accident.
“Houston is inspired” was intended to be a broad and inclusive campaign– to get the ENTIRE arts community singing the same song. That, in and of itself, is not a bad goal… IF the community at large is allowed to participate from the outset, is bought-in, and the process isn’t rushed. On this level, it failed. However, I disagree that we have to wait for our city to transform into Shangri-La before we endeavor to promote it. Perhaps the effort to get everyone on the same page about what is “good” about Houston could be a galvanizing force for simultaneously identifying what’s NOT good from a variety of voices… in 2013, not 1984. But I digress… the point is that the campaign was meant to be broad. And though my heart may be rooted as yours is in the indie community, some of our giant institutions (the opera, ballet, etc.) are world-class and worthy– just as much as our noise scene– of proud promotion. Subjective preferences shouldn’t cloud the bigger picture. That said, the GHCVB made a legitimate effort to show both sides of that coin: please look again at who is pictured in the performing arts images. It may not include David Dove (who is fantastic), but there is Joel Orr, who is simultaneously obscure in Houston and nationally recognized for his puppetry.
In closing, I agree with all points about advertising our city as something it’s not and heaping unconditional praise on a city with so much important work to do, but I don’t want to throw the baby out with the bathwater. I’d suggest we find a better way to tell our (conflicted, but promising) story, rather than simply stay mum.
PS: To further just one of the examples I used, Houston Grand Opera is presenting Wagner’s full Ring Cycle starting in 2014. During normal seasons, my godfather and his partner travel all the way from Hamburg with the sole goal of seeing opera in Houston and San Francisco… with the production of such an ambitious series of works, this is DEFINITELY the sort of thing that will draw tourists from not only all over the state, but the country.
You are right–we are talking about two different things. I am talking about this stupid ugly billboard and you are talking about a “campaign” that also includes an embarrassing website. Who is the audience for that website? Probably just convention organizers, definitely not Houstonians or even regional audiences. Please, stop it. Nobody cares about that vapid crap. It is too heavy-handed in the sales department–I get the feeling that you, as a salesperson, are never going to understand the true authenticity that I think really matters, and I am never going to agree with your urgent mission to promote tourism.
Well, they failed. You know what they say about the road to somewhere being paved with good intentions….If that is what GHVCB wanted, they should have had Houston artists (not to be confused with arts ADMINISTRATORS) sitting at the table from the outset.
Please do what you need to do. You promote tourism, I will do my best to transform it to my liking to the best of my ability. Those need not be at odds with each other, but we have different goals.
I will never have real estate developers and highway construction men and the county judges they own on “my” page. That is not my goal. Good luck convincing those vultures the value of culture and public space. I am at odds with those people. They have money; I have art. They will win, but I will put up the best fight I am capable of fighting. I will lose a pyrrhic loss, but I will retain my integrity.
What you don’t seem to get is that it is precisely those “subjective preferences” which make us unique. We are not unique for our ballet and our symphony–if it’s tourists your after, the Nutcracker is not going to bring in tourists, no matter how you and the legions of PR hacks spin it.
Finally, I made puppets and participated in puppet theater in San Francisco for four years. Bobbindoctrin really ain’t all that, and I’m not just saying that because Joel Orr never returned my queries to work with him when I first moved back in 2004. Even amateur west coast puppeteers are worlds ahead. Worlds. This city’s standards are way too low. Rather than trying to attract tourists here and have them be disappointed, we might be better off sending our artists abroad to expand their horizons and ambitions. Sorry.
Harbeer, I have endeavored, up to this point, to engage in a constructive dialogue, because I genuinely respected your opinion. But frankly, your last response is just rude. I am not a salesperson– where did you get that anyways? Nor do I work for the GHCVB. I do, however, know how the case is made for the funding Houston artists and arts organizations receive– including the grant you yourself received from HAA– which is contingent on bolstering tourism. As I’ve said before and will say again, that’s the system with which we’re stuck– don’t shoot the messenger. My end goal is for the greater art community to be better funded– for a variety of projects which may or may not fall within your subjective guidelines of worth.
And furthermore, there were reasons (timeframe among them) the first part of the campaign had to come from a small team… but it feels like you’re slapping me in the face, when I would have argued (and did argue) that artists needed to be at the table from the outset. Know your audience, Harbeer.
Lastly, I think your comments about Houston not being known for our larger institutions really betrays a very narrow perspective– one that similarly fails to be truly reflective of Houston. I will always be the biggest fan of our indie and grassroots arts scene, but if you don’t think the Alley Theatre, Houston Grand Opera, and the Houston Ballet have put us on the map in some other regions, you’re painfully mistaken.
I hate “Houston is Inspired” as a slogan. Wouldn’t something like “So many Houstons, so little time” both better evoke what we like about the city and be conducive to one of GHCVB’s (it IS a real clunker of an acronym) main goals: to encourage repeat/longer visits? I also agree that the website is way too Sell!
Sell! Sell! to be taken seriously.
That said, having clicked through to and looked over their 2011 Houston visitor profile and strategies, they don’t seem all that crazy. It sounds like they’re mostly aiming to get more visitors from the big Texas cities within driving distance to come here and to start doing more advertising in medium-size markets like Waco and border-state cities like New Orleans, Shreveport and Oklahoma City. So while some of the ad buys in the New York Times and the Wall Street Journal (and the conveniently timed travel pieces that soon followed — what, did you think there was still a firewall between advertising and editorial?) may give the impression that they’re dreaming of hordes of smitten New Yorkers and Berliners, my guess is that they’re simply taking advantage of those publications’ national reach and reputation. They want to convert day-trippers into weekenders and weekenders into long weekenders, and there are enough legitimately worthwhile things to make that doable if you know where to look for them and how to get the word out about them. I have to say that I do NOT feel this way about Austin; spending more than a night there feels excessive in a way that it need not here. (Admittedly this is because as a cultural tourist it’s the visual arts, not the music scene, that lure me.)
With THAT said, like Harbeer, I’m not entirely confident in GHCVB’s ability to execute this strategy given the reasons cited, nor, at the end of the day, should that really be our problem — “our” being defined as those of us primarily concerned with making Houston art (and the art we bring to Houston) and Houston as a city better for Houstonians. And I also believe that, both here and elsewhere, the use of economic impact to justify art — and its nasty littermate, the commodification of art by the world’s largest unregulated market — has had incredibly corrosive effects on how art gets made, discussed and experienced today. And I think those effects have been even more corrosive here than elsewhere largely because of the MFAH’s very late start in building collections, hiring curators (the MFAH took forever to get any and still has shockingly few for a museum its size) and endowing acquisition funds.
That, along with the always-sorry state of journalism in this city (entrenched long before the newspaper industry’s woes began) have cultivated a culture of mediocrity that makes tearing down the Astrodome for a parking lot at least as likely, and every bit as Houstonian, an outcome as the innovative plans to strip it down to its bones and use it as a public space. It’s why, as Ben Koush argues in his insightful response to the Alley Theatre’s renovation scheme, the board is now raising money for renovations that deliver presumably deliver needed technical upgrades/amenities while ” — even though the Alley building actually is something unique, being the last surviving regional theater built in the 1960s that still serves its original purpose and hasn’t been fundamentally altered. That is, here we have Houston boosters, who understandably want to get as many cultural tourists’ butts in Alley seats as possible, poised to undermine what can legitimately be billed as an only-in-Houston experience.
We’ve seen this movie too many times to count, and frankly I’m glad more of us are booing and throwing popcorn at the screen. And when we do, somebody (I don’t mean you, Jenni, though I think sometimes you leap ahead a little too quickly to the silver linings in a way that inadvertently gives “permission” to the hypers to keep believing their hype) is always standing by to shush us. Case in point: when my exposé on the MFAH’s years of wildly inflated attendance reports went online (), one of the first commenters asked what the point of the story was, since it wasn’t like they’d cheated, stolen or embezzled money. While hopefully they haven’t stolen or embezzled, it seems pretty clear to anyone not out to rationalize anything the MFAH (or any Houston institution) does that lying about visitor tallies IS cheating and has very real implications the commenter would prefer not to contemplate.
And while I’m all for constructive dialogue, too often the calls to be “constructive” are aimed at the people pointing out the gaping holes in the foundation rather than at the people who put them there and don’t want that pointed out. We have a surplus of “constructive” voices and a shortage of curmudgeons — all the more so since Robert Hughes died. I recommend finding his “The Mona Lisa Curse” on YouTube and watching the whole thing.
P.S. I was channeling Hughes, probably to the point of plagiarism, in my art-market remarks above.
I want to ask a question which is slightly divergent from the above article and following comments.
To any artists out there reading who have applied to HAA, Do you feel awkward or slightly dirty utilizing your practice to promotie tourism in Houston? Has HAA put the cart before the horse? Does anyone else feel disrespected by such expectations? If the board members and administrators of HAA cares an iota about art, shouldn’t they discontinue this inquiry.
It is probably banal of me to state this, but I cannot help it. We are not here to serve tourism nor to aggrandize Houston. We will continue to do what we do.

Does anyone know the mural that used to be on the side of a building east of downtown Houston? I believe the building on which the mural was painted was demolished many years ago but the mural was visible from the north-bound highway 59 feeder road, immediately north of old Chinatown. The mural was of the city, with buildings, roads, freeways. Prominent in the mural was a caricature of a freeway with eyes frowning down upon the city. It was an awesome mural and I wish it were still intact. If you have photos of the mural and know the artist’s name, please advise. I regret I never got a close look at and photos of that particular mural before it was too late.Press release from CNW Group

I’m definitely blessed to have the opportunity, and was definitely blessed, to be back at the University of Arkansas.
In coming back to the university, I know we had a real good football team that possibly has the capabilities of being a great football team, with a great senior class that could lead., We’re going to be better because of it, and that’s what they’ve done. I think that has continued this summer.
Our group has done a great job of saying, A.
That being said, I told them, this is one thing we’re going to continue to reiterate, is that this is a program, this is not about somebody leaving, somebody coming, this is one program, okay? We’re all a part of it, as players, as coaches, as fans, as a student body, we all have to relish our position as being a part of this program. We have one goal, and we’re not bashful about reiterating that goal. That goal is to win in Miami.
Our goal is to be a national championship football team and that’s what we want to get done. I know our players relish that as well as our fans and our coaches. That’s our goal for this year.
THE MODERATOR: We’ll open it up for questions for Coach Smith.
Q. You’ve got a unique situation in that your contract doesn’t even last an entire year. Can you talk about any additional pressure you’re feeling under that contract. You have three first‑team all SEC guys on offense in Wilson, Davis, Hamilton. Can you talk about the offensive potential your team has.
COACH SMITH: The pressure part of it, again, I’ve never been a big believer that the outside pressure has anything we can control. You have to be like a duck and let that water roll off your back. As coaches we all put pressure on ourselves. That pressure comes from within, within those doors, staff meetings, in what we expect to get done.
And we have a lot of pressure, yes, because we’re going to put that on ourselves because we’re expecting do have great things happen to us, yeah.
Three offensive players as good as there is in the country, we should be good offense. We totally expect that to happen, too. That’s nothing more than what has taken place over a period of time. And those players know that we have pressure on us, as well.
I think on the other side of the ball, you look at it, we expect to score points. We expect to be good offensively. We have to contribute on the other side of the ball, as well. For us to do our job over there is going to make us a championship football team.
It’s not always, and particularly in this league, the old adage of first one to 49 wins, doesn’t work in this league. We’re going to have to be one of those teams that plays defense or we’re not going to stand a chance. We’re going to have to step up and do that.
Good question.
Q. Coach, you mentioned winning in Miami. How difficult was it knowing that you had a team that could potentially be a national championship team with the Bobby Petrino stuff that happened, how hard was it to relate to the players to get them back on track and have them believe again they can win in Miami?
COACH SMITH: I don’t think that was hard at all. In stepping in, they understood everything that they have done over the last four‑year period of time, okay, what it’s taken to get to where they are. They believe in the system and what has taken place. They believe in the hard work that they had put in, okay?
So in one guy walking back in the door just reaffirmed that it’s going to be the same, it’s going to be pretty much the same, as much as it can be, okay? All of these coaches are still here. He’s going to expect the same things from us that we have in the past.
So I think from their standpoint, as easy as it could be. But yet, like I mentioned early, I believe that you grow with some adversity. They fought through adversity in the spring, okay, as did our fans, as did our coaching staff. So I expect us to all be better because of that.
I think the transition has been the easiest it could be.
Q. How surreal has this last eight months been for you? Has it been surreal, this whole experience?
COACH SMITH: Yeah, it has (laughter). In fact, I go home in the evening, my wife and I talk a little bit from time to time, and say, Wow, has this been a rollercoaster, in particular as of late.
But, yeah, anytime you get an opportunity to go back to your alma mater, it’s one of those deals that was hard having to leave.
But again, you weigh it out. I mean, doors open in life, doors close in life. All of a sudden a door, an opportunity opened. I’ve never been one to stand on the outside and wait for it to close, so you better jump through it before it does close. That’s kind of been my philosophy in life. I think that’s kind of what’s taken place over the last few months.
Again, I feel like I’m a blessed individual and I’m honored to be at the university.
Q. Would you like to be the Arkansas coach for more than one year?
COACH SMITH: Well, certainly. Do I look stupid? Don’t answer that question (smiling).
Q. Or, to put it another way, there is speculation or talk that you would need to go 14‑0 to be the Arkansas coach after this season. Have you been told anything?
COACH SMITH: That is to be determined, okay,, Yeah, you’re going to be back here next year.
Q. Not trying to be funny, but you’ve always seemed to be an ‘I have nothing to lose’ type of guy. Why is that in your personality? Running with the bulls, all the crazy stuff you do. A lot of people would not just take this job for a year.
COACH SMITH: You know, I don’t know. I guess there’s something in there that says life is an adventure and let’s make sure we take advantage of that adventure and don’t miss anything.
I keep looking back in my history. My granddad came to this country when he was a kid of 12 years old. His folks put him on a boat and said, Go to America. What kind of an adventure is that? Maybe it comes from that. I don’t know.
But I’ve never been one to turn away from an open door, an adventure to go do something. I think life is that like that.
That’s one thing as a coach you’d like to portray and get your kids to understand, is that, gosh, you’re only here a short period of time. Take advantage. Don’t ever look back that I didn’t play as hard as I can play in this game, that I missed something that I should have not missed. Don’t ever be a person in life, and I’d like the kids to go out not thinking, Gosh, what if. What if I’d worked a little harder, done this a little better.
That’s one thing I try to portray to the kids, is don’t be that guy. Take advantage of everything you’re given in this life and let’s go full bore ahead.
Q. You’re not playing Missouri this year, but going forward that rivalry will kick in. How do you see that developing? Can it be pretty heated from the get‑go because of the proximity?
COACH SMITH: Again, as I look at it from my standpoint, it’s a natural geographical rivalry for us, okay? Now, if we continue with having to play a rival on the other side of the league, as a format for scheduling, to me it’s an automatic. And it’s an automatic fit for us just because of the locale, okay?
Now we get to develop that rivalry. For us, being an automatic rival on the other side, South Carolina, I don’t know if that makes total sense just from a geographic standpoint, number one. So I think Missouri makes more sense. I think I see that as developing into a big rivalry for us, and hopefully for Missouri.
Q. How do you handle recruiting in your situation?
COACH SMITH: It goes back to this. We’re a big believer that we have to do everything we can do to get the players in the state of Arkansas to stay in the state of Arkansas. We made a big, big push to try to make sure that happens, okay? Then those players have to lead us from there.
So in saying that I, okay, and this is what I really believe, there is no other coach that can guarantee he’s going to be there next year as well. If they want you out the door, you’re going to be out the door, regardless of who you are. That being number one.
The other thing coming back to what we are trying to sell, what we are selling at the University of Arkansas. You’re not committing to an individual. If you’re committing to an individual, then you’re doing it for the wrong reason. You better be committing to a school, you better be committing to a program, you better be committing to what that program represents and wants to get done. That’s the way you want to try to sell it. If you want to commit to an individual, go commit to an individual, but that’s not what you’re doing here. That’s the way we work it. And I believe that regardless.
Q. From a distance, what was your reaction when you first heard about the Petrino story? Is there anything in your career at all that you can relate this situation to in terms of stepping into?
COACH SMITH: Answering the last one first, no, there isn’t. This is just one of those things that you would never have dreamt might happen. Anyway, it’s taken place. That’s the way it is.
It was daily. I would go to work daily, of course, and my wife would give me more of the updates on what was taking place as I would come home in the evening. So she would update me on the situation.
I tried to follow it as closely as I could. But, you know, to be honest with you, it wasn’t something‑‑ she would give me an update every evening, try to keep me abreast of what was going on. That’s kind of how I followed it. That’s kind of how I viewed it, from the outside.
Q. Were you surprised, shocked?
COACH SMITH: Surprised, yes. Shocked. Again, when it did take place, it was one of those things because that’s a part of your family. Those are people that have been with you. You’ve helped raise the kids. All of those things.
So it’s one of those things that you just pray for him and hope that the very best can take place. A mistake has happened, and hopefully it can be something that can be remedied.
Q. Can you speak a little bit about Brandon Mitchell and what role he might play? Also just based on the reports you’ve gotten, any newcomers that you can expect to play a role this season?
COACH SMITH: Well, the first newcomers that you would expect to play a role, of course, would be any of your junior college players. The latest one coming in, Demetrius Wilson, we expect something out of him, without a doubt. He’s going to have to help us because of the depth and everything as far as our wideout situation. We’re not going to be afraid to see some young guys in there, as well. They’re going to center to help.
D’Arthur Cowan, possibly. Nate Holmes possibly, some of those guys. Yeah, there’s a lot of those new guys that we’re going to have to count on, but particularly the junior college players to step in immediately.
Now, Brandon. Yeah, as coaches what you try to do is get your best players on the field in a position that they can contribute and contribute more than maybe they are. You’re exactly right. We’re working Brandon as a wide receiver. He’s done a great job. Mentally, he knows that. He knows where to line up because he’s a quarterback, he knows where everybody goes, what they do.
It’s a matter of we’re going to have to work hard technically as far as running routes, doing all of those things. But we expect to get a lot more out of him.
Does that mean he’s not going to play quarterback? It does not mean that. He’s going to be doing some double duty. Some others, as well. Kiero Small, he’s our fullback. Now, do you just be satisfied with him playing, let’s say, 15, 20% of the game when we do use the fullback? We’re going to take a look at him at playing some linebacker because that’s a spot we’re a little bit, depth‑wise, not where we would like to be. Kiero is a guy we’d like to get some double duty out of.
To answer your question, that’s our obligation as coaches, to try to get more playing time and more of your good players on the field as much as you can.
Q. How do you change the mindset of your football team so they can be competitive with Alabama and LSU since the Razorbacks lost to both top contenders by 24‑point margins?
COACH SMITH: Again, I think that comes to what takes place in the spring, what takes place in the summer, what takes place before you line up with those guys.
Our mental capacity and our mental ability, number one, believe we can compete and beat those guys, which I think our kids do. The other thing is to work harder, work harder in the weight room, in the summertime, work harder to be what they are, because they did get after us last year.
I think from the standpoint of our kids, they’re accepting the challenge that they have to be tougher mentally, to begin with, in believing you can beat those guys, and then physically, through working out in the weight room and going to the field and having it be a physical fall to begin with.
I think that will take care of itself. You have to rely on those leaders to make sure they preach that constantly.
Q. The LSU game has been the season finale for a while. There’s talk that game might change in the schedule and Missouri might be a possibility to be the season ender. Any thoughts about that?
COACH SMITH: Well, I don’t know what’s going to take place in the future as far as that schedule goes. You know Missouri is going to be in there somewhere. If that were to come down to the last game of the year, you know, I guess that would help make that a bigger rivalry immediately just because it seems like everybody saves that rivalry game for the last game.
I think that’s a possibility. I have no knowledge of that taking place.
As far as the LSU game coming to Fayetteville, I think that was out of necessity to a degree. In traveling three weeks in a row, regardless if it’s a home game or not, it’s better to sit at home and make them travel the extra distance. So I think that has a lot to do with bringing that LSU game there.
And we like having them at home. I mean, we love Little Rock. Our players, our coaches, our fans love little Rock. But, you know, we’d just as soon play LSU at home, I guess.
Q. Was contact between you and Arkansas initiated before Petrino was officially dismissed or after? How was it initiated? Also, have you had any conversation or conversations with him about the football team?
COACH SMITH: Could we move on to the next question, at least one with intelligence (smiling)? No, you didn’t get that, did you?
No, to my knowledge, we did not have any interaction till after Bobby was gone. That had all taken place prior to any of that. The actual who reached out to who, all of that stuff, it started with, I’m going to be perfectly honest with you, my talking with the coaches and vice versa. That’s where it came from.
And then I reached out.
Q. Did you have any conversations with Bobby Petrino?
COACH SMITH: I have. Yes, we talked last week. It was a good conversation. It’s the first time we talked. I think it was a way of Bobby saying, Let’s just kind of let you take care of everything, and you don’t need to answer any questions about you and I having visited. Now that we have, yes, we talked.
It was basically about our football team at Arkansas, of which he’s always concerned about that, and of course what he’s going to do from here on out with his life, things he’d like to get done.
It was more of us just getting back and catching up.
Q. How are you a different coach than the last time you were coaching at that level as a head coach, whatever you define ‘this level’ as?
COACH SMITH: I think we continue to grow. I’m a big believer in that. You better continue to grow all the time. I think I’ve grown as a coach.
Again, as I look back at Michigan State, that was a situation, that as I look, I try not to take anything for granted. That was a situation where, you know, you’re going through ‑ not to make any excuses ‑ I’m fighting a couple battles, my wife is fighting cancer, the president that hires me leaves. Don’t take anything for granted. Don’t take for granted if you have a six‑year contract it’s going to be six. I try to take that out of there. Whatever it is you do in life, don’t take it for granted. That’s why the 10‑month contract really doesn’t bother me, so…
Q. I talked to Tyler Wilson and he was turning everything into a positive. Can you talk about how valuable it is to have him as a leader on your team?
COACH SMITH: You’re going to get to talk to him, but Tyler is awesome. In the way that he has, to me, blossomed, in just my going away for the short period of time, the four months I’m gone, to come back, to have Tyler sit down, the conversations we go through. He’s exuding confidence now. I’m sure he probably felt that. There’s a guy that all of a sudden he’s starting to just blossom and exude confidence.
I think he’s very, very confident and at home in what it is we’re doing on the offensive side of the ball. I know he loves Coach Paul Petrino, what they’re doing on the field, what they’re doing watching the video, just his whole knowledge of the game of football.
Having a guy like that is tremendous, without a doubt. He’s such a positive guy, as are all of our guys really to a degree. You’re going to meet some other guys here in, Tenarius, Knile Davis, that are positive, upbeat, energetic, hard‑working individuals. You look at these guys and say, Okay, I’m going to go back and be with these guys? Yeah. That’s not that hard a decision to make.
Thank you all.6:00 AM EDT, Fri May 22, 2015
Sounder At Heart May 15, 2015
Sounders FC 2 is back in action tonight at Starfire in a rematch against coach Jimmy Nielsen and his Oklahoma Energy FC. OKC may have edged S2 at home nearly a month ago, but the Sounders will look to get some payback tonight and extend their perfect 4-0-0 record at home this season. Giuliano Frano's red card in the match last week at Sacramento Republic FC means he'll be a notable absence in the midfield, but Energy FC is missing starting defender Cyprian Hedrick due to suspension as well. Oklahoma is notably good at preventing goals this season (only 7 allowed), but S2 is notably good at...

In India, a lot of emphasis is given on customs and rituals. Indian people are ardent lovers of beauty and elegance. This is what reflects in the Mehndi ceremony before marriage. Mehendi ceremony has been prevalent since ages and forms such an integral part of the wedding ceremony that it cannot be imagined without it. Furthermore, Mehandi is one of the sixteen adornments of the bride and her beauty is incomplete without it.
Mehndi ceremony usually takes place just before marriage.. Sometimes, the Mehndi ceremony resembles another sangeet ceremony.
Nevertheless, during the ceremony, turmeric paste (made from turmeric, rosewater, water, sandalwood powder and other purifying and fragrant ingredients) is applied to both the bride and groom's face, feet and hands.. During this time female members of the family sing and dance as family and friends apply haldi on the face, arms and legs of the bride-to-be. this is usually followed by the bride and groom's re-entrance to the function. Once the haldi is washed off, the bride looks radiant and stands out in the crowd. It is believed that the yellow color lightens and clears the skin of any blemishes and brings a natural shine to the face.
After this, the Mehndi application begins. For applying Mehndi to the bride, a skilled Mehndi expert is called. she applies Mehndi on bride's hands, arms, feet and legs. Traditionally, the Mehndi applied to the bride was obtained by drying the leaves of the Henna plant. Nowadays there are various types of Mehndi designs available in the market. Some of the popular Mehndi designs include Arabic Mehndi, Rajasthani Mehndi, Crystal Mehndi and Tattoo Mehndi.
This also points towards the fact that Mehndi has become more of an accessory. However, no matter whatever might be its form, it is still an essential element of the bride. According to popular belief, the darker the color of the Mehndi, the more her husband will love her. As a tradition, the bride is not allowed to work in her marital house till the time her Mehndi does not fade away. This ceremony takes place amidst musical beats with women singing for a prosperous marital life of the couple.Welcome back to Stockhouse Member Sign In

With his blossoming wife due any day now, actor Josh Duhamel sat down with us to talk about his latest film, supporting Fergie, and past brouhahas with friends. The very pregnant Fergs and her husband caused quite a clamor during the Hollywood premiere of Scenic Route, which stars Duhamel as a dark and twisted character. Playing Mitchell, Duhamel’s character finds himself in a tension-filled situation with his lifelong friend Carter when their truck breaks down on an isolated desert road. Dan Fogler, who many will recall from Balls of Fury, plays the close comrade who begins to attack his friend’s life decisions with unwavering brutality. There’s even a scene where the former Transformer action hero disses his pregnant wife, but in real life, Duhamel’s love for his lady’s lumps is electric. At the Chinese 6 Theater in Hollywood, the 40-year-old actor told The Huffington Post that even though his “dark and twisted” character feels that his wife is unattractive, he thinks Fergie has “never been more beautiful.” “It’s the one thing that I sort of opposed in the script and I tried to get it cut out,” Duhamel said. The film opens in limited release Friday. We were able to get a few minutes of Josh Duhamel’s time prior to the film’s premiere. In our chat, he shares his feelings about his wife’s pregnancy, playing a dark and twisted character, and on friends who make eyes with his sister.
Latest Kevin L. Clark's Cloudcasts on MixcloudThings got intense in Legally High (Channel 4), a haunting documentary about Britain’s growing market in legal drugs – and the users who are hooked on them. It was a chilling insight into hemp shops, underground dealers and exporters who deliver “drugs to your door”.
The tragic star was Baxter, a 21-year-old from North Yorkshire, who buys research chemicals online and sells them to his friends. “I love life,” he groaned, hallucinating on a grotty sofa, “I feel wicked.” He read out a list of 62 drugs he’d tried (“that I can remember”), and we watched him cutting lines of powder on a DVD case amid beer cans and crumpled McDonald’s wrappers. It wasn’t a pretty sight.
Dr Zee, a mysterious Israeli-born mathematician, was the villain – the man behind mephedrone (“miaow miaow”) and 50 other legal highs. Bizarrely, he allowed Reed to film his top-secret drug storage facility, and even sampled one of his new creations on camera. His explanation of how easy it is to get around the Misuse of Drugs Act – a new chemical bond here, a different element there – was shocking.
This area has been well-documented, but Legally High was original and provocative. I could have done without the thumping trance-like soundtrack, but the rest – trippy, garbled interviews with users; scenes from the delivery depot; depressing portraits on Redcar beach – made for essential viewing.
One story that will stay with me is that of Ali, who tests out legal highs and posts his findings online: a sort of freelance drug reviewer (known as a “psychonaut”). For Valentine’s Day, he and his girlfriend ordered the latest little white pill from a website, sat down for a romantic meal, and then dosed up on drugs at the dinner table. “There’s a fine line between use and abuse,” we were told. “But when you’re having fun, you don’t understand that.”“…they should be boiled until done, in good, soft water; and, when nearly done, throw in a handful of clean Timothy hay; it absorbs all impurities which may be around the outside of the ham. As soon as done, take out the hay, but leave the ham in the water until nearly cold, when you may take it out.” [Annual Report of the Commissioner of Patents. 1852]
When boiling ham, hay would be placed in the bottom of a ham boiler. A few authors said to “…tie it up in clean hay…” [E. Smith, 1727; Table, 1854 - see below]
Hay could also be part of the storing process: “Make sacks of coarse cotton cloth, large enough to hold one ham, and fill in with chopped hay all around about two inches thick. The hay prevents the grease from coming in contact with the cloth and keeps all insects from the meat. Hang in the smokehouse, or other dry, cool place, and they will keep a long time.” [Youman, A.E. A Dictionary of Every-day Wants. NY: 1872]A further use of hay in the late 19th/early 20th centuries was for hay boxes, which were early forms of fireless cookers. In the future, I will post an article on this unusual cooking apparatus.

To boil a Ham. Lay your ham in cold water for two hours, wash it clean, and tie it up in clean hay; put it into fresh water, boil it very slow for one hour, and then very briskly for an hour and a half more. Take it up in the hay and let it lie in til cold, then rub the rind with a clean piece of flannel. [E. Smith. The Compleat Housewife, 1727]
To Boil a Ham. —There are so many "best modes" of cooking ham, that it is difficult to decide among them. This much, however, is certain, that unless you have a very good cook, it will be well to envelop the ham in a flour-and-water crust, and bake it. Hams are sometimes boiled in lard, and the reason for this is, that it takes a very high temperature to make fat boil, and consequently the ham is cooked very gently. Some persons boil it in champagne, and others in white wine.The old-fashioned way was to boil a ham, of about 20 lb. weight, in the boiler from three and a-half to about five hours, according to its size, simmering it all the time. The more modern method appears to be to put it in cold water, and bring it to boil; then simmer till done. A very old-fashioned way in England to boil hams, and which has a great many admirers to this day, is wrapping up the ham in hay, and simmering it very gently; while others are contented to place hay under the ham in the pot. No harm is done by either mode; but the cook must remember, that the ham is to be put into hot water and never allowed to boil. But to cook a ham to perfection, make a large pot-au-feu, and cook your ham in it. Let it simmer until an iron skewer will enter easily to the bone; then lift it out of the pot; take the skin off; either glaze it, or sift fine raspings over it. Send it hot or cold to table, and we will promise that neither white wine nor champagne is required to make it excellent. The hay had better be given to your horse, and the white wine and champagne drunk at table. [Table Observances. London: 1854]
TO BOIL A HAM. Wash and scrape the ham clean ; put it on in cold water enough to cover it; put into the water two onions, two carrots, a head of celery, a dozen cloves and a handful of timothy hay; boil without stopping until the skin will readily peel from the ham; cover the ham with rolled crackers, or bread crumbs that have been browned and rolled, and bake in a slow oven for two hours. [The Home Cook Book. Chicago]Nice sweet timothy hay, cut fine, is the best thing extant for packing bacon, as it imparts a pleasant aromatic taste ... [Thomas, John. The Illustrated Annual Register of Rural Affairs and Cultivator. 1870]

Ingredients
- 4 cups ice water
- 24 saltine crackers
- 1/4 cup melted butter
Instructions
Preheat oven to 400 degrees. Grease a baking sheet or two. Have ready a bowl of ice water, the melted butter and a small, soft brush. Drop the crackers in the water about 6 at a time. After 28-30 seconds, carefully but quickly lift them out, allow water to drain well, and place on a baking sheet. Do not try to do too many at one time because by the time you get to the last ones they will have become too soggy. When you have a full baking sheet, brush each cracker lightly with the melted butter. Don't use too much pressure because you don't want to flatten the crackers. Toast in the oven for 10 minutes, then turn heat down to 300 degrees. Continue to toast for an additional 10 to 15 minutes. Let cool; store in a container with a tight lid. Yield: 24 crackers.

"They are not criminals and scroungers caricatured by Mr Farage and his ilk. They pay their own way and contribute more than their fair share to the UK economy," said Antonescu, who is the ruling Social Liberal Union's candidate in next year's Romanian presidential elections.
He said in advance of his meeting that he recognised there had always been populist politicians happy to take advantage of people's fears for electoral gain, but he was saddened to find that this was still the case in the UK.
"In 2007 when Romania joined the EU we reluctantly agreed to postpone the application for the fourth fundamental freedom of the EU – the right to live, work and learn anywhere in the UK – until 2014," he wrote on politics.co.uk.
"We are therefore frustrated and offended that some now suggest that these restrictions should be maintained to stop an imaginary tsunami of uneducated, unwashed criminals from swamping civilisation."
He cited figures showing that 62% of Romanians in Britain have no dependents, 32% only have one child and only 300 claims for child benefit were made in 2012. Recent Metropolitan police statistics show a 50% fall in the arrests of Romanians in London from 3,400 in the first three months of 2012 compared with 1,700 in the first three months of this year.
Clegg is understood to have acknowledged the positive contribution to the economy made by the Romanian community legally in Britain. A Foreign Office-commissioned report published in April challenged claims by David Cameron and others that Britain faces a significant new wave of immigration when labour movement restrictions are lifted in January.
The study by the National Institute of Economic and Social Research said that the UK was unlikely to be the preferred destination for Bulgarians and Romanians. It added that those who do leave Romania were far more likely to go to Spain and Italy, where 1.7 million Romanians are already living and working, and this is unlikely to change despite the impact of the recession.
A spokesman for the deputy prime minister said that Clegg agreed with Antonescu's profile of the Romanian community in Britain but stressed that a robust approach would be taken to all those who came to the UK simply to rely on benefits, whatever their nationality.
Some backbench Conservative MPs have claimed that as many as 350,000 – 450,000 Romanians and Bulgarians are poised to move to Britain at the end of this year. Ukip's leader Nigel Farage has claimed the number is likely to be closer to 750,000.
A report published on Thursday said that immigration into the world's largest economies has a negligible effect on the public finances of host countries, with foreigners contributing as much in tax revenues as they receive in benefits.
The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development said in its international migration outlook report for 2013 that Romania, which has only 0.3% of the global population, also exports a higher percentage of its populace than any other country. The largest exporters of migrants into the 33 OECD countries are India, China and Pakistan.
"Migration represents neither a significant gain nor drain for the public purse. Immigrants are pretty much like the rest of the population in this respect," said the OECD report.Verizon Theatre at Grand PrairieGrand Prairie, Texas

Even the best-known composer in his lifetime may fall into obscurity after death. Belgian composer François-Joseph Gossec was acknowledged to be the greatest instrumental composer at the close of the ancien régime in France (Marie Antoinette loved his music) and, after an amazing about-face, he was also acknowledged to be the greatest composer of the Revolutionary and Napoleonic periods (Robespierre loved his music).
But all his fame has faded from memory, and Gossec is instead remembered for having composed the “Tambourin” for Flute and Orchestra. Taken from his divertissement-lyrique (a genre similar to opera) Le triomphe de la République, ou Le camp de Grandpré, this delightfully bright and lively piece is nearly mandatory among flutists: James Galway and Jean-Pierre Rampal have performed and recorded it numerous times.Grassroots funding of a culturally inclusive space at the University of Washington inspired by former Husky Bruce Lee & the Duwamish Tribe.
The UW Community Peace Garden project was started in 2007 by students, local community members and supporters, with the intention of recognizing and commemorating the contributions of all students and community groups representing diverse cultural backgrounds.
Inspired by the life and teachings of alumnus Bruce Lee, the project started as a class through the Comparative History & Ideas Department (CHID), and later spread throughout the World via social media.
Once picked up by local and national press, support began to spring up rapidly in respect to the essential message of the project: to inspire peace for all people. Since then, it has been an amazing inclusionary experience which has sparked the spirit of service and peace from people all around the World.
Having support from the Bruce Lee Foundation and the official blessing of the Lee family, the small volunteer grassroots group began collaborating with the University of Washington Architecture Committee to find the most appropriate space. After years of groundwork, the most suitable location was found currently known as the "Island Grove".
Located right near the Drumheller Fountain, the Island Grove provides a partially shaded and open space that has been rarely intruded upon since the inception of the University. In fact, it is one of the few places on campus that has native soils, and provides one the few nesting locales for the Great Blue Heron.
In recognition of the struggle for native and indigenous rights of our great Pacific Northwest region, there will also be a planned commemoration to the Duwamish Tribe in the Community Peace Garden. Ideas include a series of circular benches made from Alaskan Cedar (donated from the community), with the word "Peace" engraved around the circle in several of the Worlds languages.
Now, some 5 years after starting the project, the Community Peace Garden is looking to be funded by people like you! Just a small donation of a one, five, or ten dollars can help us bring this inspired project to reality! Find out more by clicking below, and spread the message along to your friends and family!

Date ideas, news, online dating, & more
by Ms.Dating Consultant Leave a Comment
While hundreds of thousands of singles across the globe use the Internet to meet their soul mates, every once in a while you hear a story about someone who trusted their online love match a little too much.
It’s true that dating has its dangers, and that point is underscored when using the Internet. However, you don’t need to fear this type of technology. With common sense and smart dating practices, you can meet new people with confidence instead of fear. To that end, here are some points to remember.
Online Matches Are Strangers
Perhaps the biggest falsehood Internet daters buy into is that their online match is a friend. While the ability to chat with an online match before you meet them is a definite plus, the reality is that until you get to know him or her you need to proceed as if your Internet date is a complete stranger. Only when you truly get to know them over time will you be able to assess whether they are right for you.
Be Cautious When Giving Out Personal Information
The great thing about Internet dating is that you don’t need to give out your phone number, last name, or address until you’re absolutely ready to do so. Use this to your advantage. Never let someone pressure you into going around the double-blind email system or giving them personal information until it feels right. Trust your gut instinct. If someone makes you feel uncomfortable for any reason, they may be an online dater to avoid.
Meet Out at a Public Location
Never have a first date pick you up at your house or even walk you to your car until you see them out a few times. Meet them at a location away from your own neighborhood and in a very public place. Coffee shops are the perfect location to meet a blind date and talk. If you do set up a date later, continue to meet them out rather than have him or her pick you up at your place.
Know the Signs of Con Artists
Being smart about dating doesn’t mean being cynical. So pay attention to details when you first meet someone. If a date asks you for money, tells you a sob story to get your bank account information, or insists on meeting you anywhere but a public place: leave immediately. If the person you’ve just met seems weird or “off,” take heed and protect yourself. Some people are simply up to no good.
Be a Confident Single
No one likes to be alone without the prospect of meeting the right one. But the truth is, some people don’t deserve the benefit of the doubt. Don’t lower your standards or give in to someone you don’t really trust. Being single is a superior option to being taken advantage of. If a situation doesn’t seem right for any reason, have the confidence to believe that something better will be along very soon.LTD Tour, Day Fishing Tournament July 19-20
It's about honor. It's about remembering. It's also about fun.
It's about honor. It's about remembering. It's also about fun.
The third annual LTD Motorcycle Memorial Tour will be held Saturday, July 19. The tour honors three local soldiers who lost their lives on February 21, 2005, in Iraq, namely SGT Jesse Lhotka, 1LT Jason Timmerman, and SSG David Day.
The fourth-annual David F. Day Fishing Tournament is Sunday, July 20, at Lake Minnewaska. Registration is at the Water's Edge in Starbuck.
The LTD Tour has grown dramatically in just three years. The first year 250 people attended. The second year there were 650 plus people. In addition, $25,000 was given out to five scholarship winners and $5,000 given to the Camp Ripley Disabled Veterans Deer Hunt.
This year, organizers are anticipating 1,200 people and will be awarding $20,000 in scholarships, $5,000 to the Montevideo VA clinic and $5,000 to the Camp Ripley Disabled Veterans Deer Hunt.
Bikers can begin registration for the tour at 8:00 a.m. at the Montevideo TACC parking lot. Kickstands will be up and rolling at 10:30 a.m.
Participants who do not have a bike will be able to take advantage of a chartered bus. The bus will allow families and others to ride along. Automobiles will not be able to be a part of the run due to the number of bikes this year and law enforcement preference.
Leaving Montevideo, the tour will drive thru Marshall and Canby. A noon dinner will be served at the Madison TACC/Armory. The afternoon will have the bikes driving through Ortonville, Clinton and Graceville with a stop at the American Legion in Morris. After going through Holloway, bikers will end the run in Appleton.
The riders will form a parade through Appleton beginning at 4:30 p.m. The parade will start at the west end of Lhotka Street and move right onto Hering. From there they will go past the Paddle Bar and Lounge and go down Appleton's main street. Be sure to get out along this route to see an amazing sight and to cheer on the riders.
The final destination is the Appleton Fairgrounds where participants will enjoy a meal together.
A live band will end the day. Pandora will rock the Appleton Fairgrounds well into the night. The band will begin playing at 8:00 p.m. and is open to the public. All riders can attend the dance free. Non-riders can attend for a cover charge.
Raffle tickets and T-shirts for the LTD Motorcycle Memorial Tour are available in advance at the House of Spirits in Appleton. Both will also be available during registration and at the end of the tour.
The drawing for the raffle tickets will be held during the evening festivities. The winner will take home a 2008 Heritage Softail Harley Davidson.A gem of a series, Gavin & Stacey immediately draws the viewer in with its humor and warmth, all the while deepening the characters and their lives in ways that inspire real investment from its audience. Created and written by James Corden and Ruth Jones, who also star as Smithy and Nessa, respectively, the three seasons are a brilliant blend of comedic and emotional payoff.
Based on a real life friend of Corden’s (also named Gavin), the series follows the quick courtship between Gavin (Matthew Horne), from Essex, England and Stacey (Joanna Page), from Barry Island, Wales. Their whirlwind romance moves from first date (albeit after months of talking over the phone), to a proposal, to a wedding all within the first season. In moving their relationship forward so rapidly, their families and friends are also immediately brought together and much of the series hangs on their interactions.
Gavin’s parents, Mick (Larry Lamb) and Pam (Alison Steadman), are the perfect counterparts to Stacey’s mother, Gwen (Melanie Walters) and Uncle Bryn (Rob Brydon). Where Gavin’s parents are boisterous and enthusiastic, Stacey’s family is more reserved. In addition, Smithy, Gavin’s best friend, and Nessa, Stacey’s best friend, also serve as immediate connections to their lives, pre-coupledom. Although they initially seem to be quite different from each other, both sets of families – and extended families – quickly form a friendship and bond that seems as natural as if they had been in one another’s lives for much longer.
While the series is ostensibly about Gavin and Stacey, it’s really more about the larger definition of family and friends. For the speed with which Gavin and Stacey’s relationship develops, they are not without their own struggles, namely about where they should live and how much time they want to spend with their respective families. Although their conflicts are usually resolved swiftly, the series does a nice job of making any problem or misunderstanding real enough to keep the audience fully interested and engaged.
The constant interactions with between the series’ leads and others offer most of Gavin & Stacey’s best moments. Whether they are all celebrating their first Christmas together or traveling back and forth, in caravan, to see each other regularly, all the characters exhibit a genuine affection and camaraderie that lends the series a sense that despite their differences, they all obviously care deeply for one another.
Smithy and Nessa are the kind of oddball characters that could easily seem too strange or outside of Gavin and Stacey’s worlds to easily fit into the show’s environment. However, their weird habits and traditions are exactly the kinds of details that ground the series as true to life. Smithy’s propensity for bursting into song and Nessa’s matter-of-fact tellings of her outrageous past are some of the funniest moments in Gavin & Stacey, but they are also the perfect encapsulation of how enmeshed these characters all are. The comfort and total trust that they each have within their groups speaks to the longevity of their bonds, and in turn, makes Gavin and Stacey’s attachment to them all the more understandable.
As the series progresses, Mick, Pam, Gwen, Bryn, Smithy, and Nessa all form relationships with each other. Smithy and Nessa’s relationship is especially interesting in that there is clearly something that draws them together, but they are equally repulsed by each other. Their ongoing storyline is one of the highlights of the series, as well as arguably just as important as that of Gavin and Stacey.
The series excels in bringing together a wonderful cast of recurring characters, along with the already core cast. Gavin and Smithy’s friends are a colorful group whose genuine enthusiasm further cements these characters as true to life, as do Pam and Mick’s closest friends, bitter married couple Dawn (Julia Davis) and Pete (Adrian Scarborough). Similarly, the Barry Island bunch adds a believable community environment that makes Stacey so attached to her home. Dave Coaches (Steffan Rhondri), the coach driver and Nessa’s boyfriend, and Doris (Margaret John), Stacey’s elderly and often inappropriate neighbor are an integral part of Barry Island, and therefore, of Stacey’s life.
As a true ensemble series, all the actors do a terrific job of bringing this oddball cast to life, but special mention should be made of Corden and Jones, as they add an unexpected balance to the show. Steadman and Brydon are also standouts as Pam and Bryn. Steadman’s comedic timing and complete commitment to Pam’s emotional highs and lows is a definite highlight, while Brydon makes Bryn’s eccentricities work so well.
Lasting three seasons, Gavin & Stacey is an excellent snapshot into the lives of these characters. While the series could have easily continued, Corden and Jones smartly gave the show a complete arc that seamlessly blends humor with realistic relationships. In the end, the series offers a portrait of this large and extended family, unconventional though it may be, with intelligence, wit, and heart.
The DVD set comes with a ton of special features including deleted scenes, selected commentary tracks, cast and creator interviews, and general behind the scenes featurettes. They are a wonderful addition to the series and offer a deeper understanding of the characters and series, while showing the obvious fondness the cast has for each other.

A threat made by one student against another shut down Ocoee Middle School Friday.
Parents received phone messages from the district, letting them know the school was on lockdown.
A student reportedly posted a threat against another child on Facebook.
Ocoee police said more than a year ago, some students at Ocoee Middle got into a fight, and one of the students then moved to Apopka.
"The kid in Apopka made mention of, 'Hey you didn't talk about me while I was there and now you are talking about me because I can't do anything. Don't think I can't do anything about this,'" said Ocoee police Lt. Mike Bryant. "He made a veiled threat as if he was going to take care of the argument a little bit more."
Messages included "I have Ocoee on the news first 48. I swear to God I'm going to jail (expletive) all y'all," meaning something was going to happen to make it on the news, and "I'm going to shoot some of y'all for talking behind my back."
Students like seventh-grader Cheyanne Bass said they were concerned.
"He posted on Facebook, 'If I see y'all in school, I'm bringing my gun. I'm going to shoot you and stuff,'" said Bass.
The school and 911 dispatch were inundated with calls from concerned parents.
"What I think really caused the problem was the message that came from the school was a little bit garbled, so parents were hearing 'lockdown, police investigation' and then the whole telephone thing turned into a big panic," said Bryant.
Principal Sharyn Gabriel said there were computer and phone glitches during the incident and that they are working on the problem. A second call to parents came from district offices.
Police said the Facebook threat ended before it even began because the student then posted, "I'm letting it go because at the end of the day I know who I am."
Bryant said they made contact with the student and spoke to him and his mother.
Gabriel said she will send out another message to parents urging them to talk to students about making threats on social media.The Dragon Kevin O’Leary Landed at Vortex
On the second day of the Vortex Competition on November 4th for would be game developers Kevin O’Leary spoke to share his wisdom in creating and selling companies. He knows how to roll in the dragon’s den and how to handle a shark. Kevin O’Leary is a Canadian entrepreneur who has been a serial entrepreneur for most of his career building and selling companies.
While many people in the audience just want to create great games, it is a business and that is something Kevin is an expert at. According to Kevin his talk was about the truth about making money and why nothing else matters. When you run a start up it is “all about the money all the time.” Kevin says that capital always pursues the path of highest return and lowest risk.
According to him the main players for a start up are:
- Shareholders – More important than anything else by a factor of 1000 and they are always looking for ROI
- Customers – Expensive to get and hard to keep
- Employees – One of the biggest expenses for a business, so less is always more
- Competition – Kevin glossed over them but they are the enemy number 1
- Government regulation – Can put you in jail and cost the business money
- Board of directors – Another one he glanced over but they help to lead the business
- Community – Hard to define and is about the warm and fuzzies
So in Kevin’s universe shareholders or the ones with cash the life blood of an entrepreneur. Kevin also believes that if you are just an employee and not given equity then you really are not a good employee.
What he says is that to be successful you must have a myopic focus on the dollar. You must have no conscious or mercy. This focus changes your behaviour and you must do the right thing for money. So you have to have a laser focus on shareholder returns.
Finally he talked about luck, that every entrepreneur needs luck and that you win some and loose some and that sometimes that break is simply luck.
Kevin speaks from years of experience of starting up companies and selling them and he was passionate and driven. You could definitely see and feel his hunger in every word. That is what makes you pay attention because when he was talking I knew that he speaks from experience and drive.
You may not agree with everything Kevin stated but you can respect it. Finally he showed an amazing pitch by JumpForward (to see it click here) from Sharktank the US version of Dragon’s Den. They went in looking for $150k and came out with $600k and amazing exposure for the firm and a hell of a lot of capital to grow the business.
That is something that can’t be bought you either have it or you don’t and in this audience full of would be game developers you knew that many of them had the fire and hopefully they have some luck as well to make their games and dreams happen.Apps

I'm a member of more forums on the web than I can count and each one of them has a mechanism for tracking new posts.. I realize that this isn't a full-blown forum script, but I'm just wondering.. how do you people here keep up with new posts? I don't even see a focused way of doing this here.. it takes far too long to just click through guessing what's new and what isn't...
Posted at 9:57am on October 14, 2005
I agree, it's so hard to remember when thread you've read or if anything is new.
I did notice that the entry page tells you if any of the three forums had new comments, however, when you go into one, the "new" comments are lost on the other two forums.
I've just been re-reading everything. I guess, since it's Beta, we just have to stuck with it until the kinks are ironed out.

If you just want to watch one or two threads you could try
There are definitely things that can be improved with the forum, and we'll get onto that soon.
If you have specific feature requests, please post them here :)
Well, for starters, how about using a real forum script? This is my absolute favorite:
If you want to see it in action, visit the forums at. It would not only make using the forum more convenient, fun and effective, it would also help you with the very purpose of having a forum in the first place.
The current forum is the most stripped down version of a forum I've ever seen. It blends in with the site's simplicity, but this is an instance where focus on simplicity has overrun usability.
In short: upgrade your forum software on the server.
On a side-note.. there also seems to be a bug with the forum concerning Opera 8.5. When I hit "post", the page never finishes loading. I have to hit F5 to reload the page to have it show my latest post...
Well, I rather like how easy and uncomplicated this forum is. The only features I would like to add are:
- nested discussions, so i can reply to someone else's comment
- some indication of which threads/discussions are new or have been expanded since my last visit
Yes, please _don't_ use a "real" forum script. I love this one, like I love stock.xchng's forum.
I'd be happy with read/unread ability.
I would like the ability to quote from another users post.
but I'm just wondering.. how do you people here keep up with new posts?
Ever heard of bookmarking a page? It works really well. I like del.icio.us. It's the shiznit!
Anyway, this forum is fine. I mean it's not freaking Neowin here. And thank fudge for that.
Morons, learn some basic HTML.
sjvilla79, please be nice :)
moerl's post referred to our initial version of the forum, where it was harder to keep track of new and updated posts.
Hopefully things should be a little easier now, although I'm still hassling Omar to fix the unread issue :)
Please keep the suggestions coming :)
Emily, yes. Sorry. :)
Carry on, grasshoppers!Seibertron.com - The Ultimate Transformers Fansite

Man followed girl while she was walking to school
ARVADA, Colo. - Arvada Police said they are investigating a report that a man followed a girl for a short time on Monday morning while she was walking to school.
The student told police the man approached her at 7:40 a.m. at Memorial Park.
The girl told officers that the man asked her to come over.
The girl told police that as she walked away, the man started following her.
The man is described as being about 30 years old and 6 feet tall with possibly a goatee. He was wearing a black hoodie and a green T-shirt.
"We will notify parents of these reports," Arvada Police posted on Facebook. "We do, however, want to caution citizens that while we will look into each report; each one is not suspect."
One person posted on the Arvada Police Facebook page that they did get a note from their grandchild's school about the incident.
Officers did not release any information about the girl's age or her school.
If you need help talking to your children or grandchildren about strangers, read this advice from the National Center for Missing & Exploited Children.

Many travellers approach Reims as an excuse for a quick tour of a champagne house, a cracking meal and the purchase of a case or two of bubbles. But that would mean ignoring some of France's most important heritage, from its pure Gothic cathedral to fine museums.
"If you only see one French cathedral, it has to be Notre-Dame de Reims," says our guide, Francoise Buckley. "The facade is unique." Looking up at the hundreds of statues on the cathedral's west front, it's hard to disagree.
She points out the city's emblem, a 13th-century figure known as L'Ange au Sourire. "As a child, I asked why the angel had such a happy smile," Buckley says. "'Because it's been drinking champagne,' was the reply!"
You could fit a rugby field into the Gothic nave; the dazzling stained glass ranges from a 13th-century rose window and Chagall's 20th-century designs to the bold reds, blues and yellows that were installed for the cathedral's 800th anniversary last year.
But what makes Reims special for the French is the royal connection: 33 kings were crowned here, most famously Charles VII.
Next door, in the Palais du Tau (the cathedral museum), we see larger-than-life statues of sovereigns and peer at the grandiose robes worn by Charles X, the last king crowned here in 1825. Our royal history lesson continues in the Saint-Remi Basilica. Simple and serene, the 1000-year-old church is named after the bishop, who baptised Clovis in 496. This barbarian-turned-Christian became the first king of the Franks, an empire that metamorphosed into France. The basilica, too, has its own museum.
All four sites have UNESCO World Heritage status. The region has applied for a fifth, for Champagne. At Taittinger, 3 million bottles sit in the former wine cellars of a 13th-century church. "It takes a remueur 10 seconds to rotate 60 bottles one eighth of a turn," our guide said, as we pass racks of upside-down bottles. Even more lie deeper, 20 metres underground in galleries cut out of the chalk by the Romans.
A more visible Roman legacy is above ground: the massive Porte de Mars, with its three stone arches. But there is so much more to discover.
In the church of St Jacques, Romanesque, Gothic and Renaissance styles rub shoulders. The city's art gallery might look like a prison, but it has superb watercolour portraits by Cranach the Elder and 20 paintings by Corot. In a half-timbered town house, Le Vergeur Museum has a collection of woodcuts by Durer.
After most of Reims was flattened in World War I, it was rebuilt in a potpourri of styles, particularly art deco. Recent additions include a new tramway and pedestrianised streets. Soon, the renovated covered market will reopen in the fashionable Boulingrin quartier.
More sober is the Surrender Museum. Here, on May 7, 1945, the Germans signed documents that ended the conflict in Europe. The museum opened a few weeks later.
"For 1500 years, we have been on the frontline," we're told. "That's why Reims has a special place in French history."

A rustle of movement in the bushes nearby provokes him to reflexively fire his shotgun at the sound, only to discover that he’s just fatally wounded a young woman. When he finds a lockbox full of hundred-dollar bills in her possession, he’s prompted to hide the body, take the cash, and not report the accident to anyone. And as sure as night follows day, ruthless killers come searching for their missing money, and Moon is their prime target. Tension, aggression, and violence escalate from there.
The HD picture sports a crisp and even transfer. The tone of this film is bleak, bleak, and more bleak, and the dour visuals aptly suit the mood. Perpetually overcast and gray, bright colors and sunlight are nonexistent, and where poorly pixilated gradation between light and dark is expected, there is little to cause distraction. Whether indoors or out, the color scheme remains drab and uninviting, and it’s a suitably effective mood enhancer.
The 5.1 DTS-HD Master Audio has a few flourishes of forest ambience, a passing train, and gunfire but ultimately offers little beyond its oppressive and haunting score that holds court in the center channel. This is a dark drama, and there is as much menace in the quieter moments as there is with the noise. A Dolby Digital 2.0 audio mix is offered too.
Extras are bare-bones and include a short making-of featurette, cast and crew interviews, and theatrical trailer. No DVD or Digital Copy.

Would be great if they included the mounting disc as was received with new Tom Tom unit. The suction cup wont stay on the glass for more than an hour or two. Not faulting anyone directly, as it seems the problem with most GPS bracketing systems regardless of the manufacturer.

Received in timely fashion. They did have an issue with shipping to my work address, and even though i listed cell # as primary contact list they left 2 messages on my home phone before reaching me on my cell. I knew i would be out of town, that was why i listed my cell as primary contact #. Once we confirmed the ship to i received it a few days.

I wanted to be Optimus Prime. The biggest, baddest goodest, most awesomeness Transformer ever. You can’t be plain and be Optimus Prime.
So I wasn’t just chocolate. I was nutty. And I was chocolate frosted. Chocolate nutty brownie overload. That was me.
Ok, so that wasn’t me talking above there, as in that wasn’t me ~ catty. That there was my brownie talking, and no I don’t have a multiple personality disorder. I mean, who the hell talks as if they’re a brownie?!
Yeah. Only cra-zee people.
Anyway, my brownie might have wished he was Optimus Prime but honestly? I’m a Bumble Bee kinda girl. Simple and sweet.
I was sort of excited plastering the frosting on the slab of brownie but truth be told, I thought the frosting overpowered the deliciousness of a plain nutty brownie and shhhh… I ended up scraping the icing off.
But if you’re still keen to give it a shot because oh I don’t know “your brownie” wants to be “Optimus Prime” (who the f*** comes up with this shit?), then here’s the recipe:
OH.MY.GOD,Are you trying to kill us with your recipe?!! It is to die for!!
That is a Brownie that wants to be a CupCake, but draws the line at whirlygigs…
No, see, frosting on brownies is just wrong!
*sigh*
I guess you had to go and learn the hard way… 😉
Mathilde: Haha I’m not so much trying to “kill” you as “help” you get in touch with your sweet buds
Lynne: LOL, yes, this brownie has not yet come out of the closet.
aforkful: I did learn the hard way, hence baking a whole new set a mere two days later! 😀
That’s serious frosting!! It almost looks like the surface of a Mars bar!
So these were the brownies you were tweeting about! I understand why now. 😉 I love the thickness of that frosting! Hehe.
Sarah: LOL I know, I thought I’d have a little bit of brownie to go with the frosting
Su-yin: LOL yeh there’s just a little bit too much frosting but hey, you only live once!
Wow, that looks inteeeeense!!!
xox Sarah
Love the brownie, so yummy looking- I want to reach in and snatch it up! Look forward to learning how to make a Mac with you this winter. My first attempt was, well . . . not exactly perfect.
Sarah: Yes, INTENSE. death by frosting INTENSE.
Cristie: I haven’t made a mac! I don’t know how??? I’d rather just eat them, they take way too much finesse to make and well, that’s just something I don’t have!
I wish you lived here so that you could make that for me =( Looks so damn good!!!!!
this really is the flipping Optimus Prime of brownies. check out the frosting. you’ve got me, hun you really do. I’m sold. Wed me? x
Loving that thick layer of gorgeous chocolate cream frosting…
Anh: I wish I was living there so you can cook me Vietnamese food
miss you babe xx
diva: LOL I know right? There’s more frosting than brownie, if that isn’t Optimus I don’t know what is!
Kitchen Butterfly: me too x
Think my hubby just fell in love with you a little when he saw the photo of the brownie! These are similar to his favourite frosted brownies from Hummingbird Bakery – he loves those! I may have to make him some – pre-January dieting!
LOL thanks Anne! Yes, it was actually an adaptation of the Hummingbird recipe ~ I didn’t use the brownie recipe, I also added some nuts, but I did use the Hummingbird frosting recipe
Make some and let me know how you go

They dubbed the operation "Pharmacia de Juicy Phruit." The nationwide investigation started in 2006 with an informant's tip in Fort Bend County.
They had arrested at least 66 suspects by Wednesday afternoon and more are being sought.
Investigators say the suspects were distributing anabolic steroids, human growth hormones, ecstasy, vicodin, xanax, codeine syrup and viagra.
"The steroids in some cases cause pain and other problems which the vicodin and Viagra is necessary to counteract," said Fort Bend County Sheriff Milton Wright. Wright said they also confiscated 50 marijuana plants at one home.
The list of suspects includes professional bodybuilders, gym owners, personal trainers and even pharmacists.
Dozens of suspects were arrested in the pre-dawn raid in Fort Bend and Harris counties. Wright called it a "loosely-knit organization" that operated out of gyms and fitness centers in Fort Bend and Harris counties.
"It's one of those things where they've got their friends on speed-dial. When they need a certain product, they know who to call," he said.
Wright said 49 suspects face state charges and 17 face federal charges ranging from manufacturing to selling, possessing and distributing illegal drugs.
The suspects were taken to a staging area at the Fort Bend County Fairgrounds. They were processed then taken to jail.
Officers confiscated pills, what is believed to be marijuana plants, cash and other items during the raids at several area homes.
At least some of the steroids were being manufactured in the Heights in North Houston, according to authorities.
Investigators say most of the chemicals used to make the drugs came from China.
Officials say simultaneous arrests took place in Dallas, California and Georgia.
The investigation and operation is being led by the Fort Bend County Sheriff’s Office and the Drug Enforcement Agency. Sheriff Wright called it the largest narcotics bust in his county's history.
"A lot of people don't think there's much danger in the steroids, but there's a lot of broken families, broken homes, people hurt that are caused by illegal use of steroids we never know about because of the many side effects...," Wright said. "
Officers from Houston, Pearland, Richmond, Rosenberg, the Harris County Sheriff's Office, the DEA, the U.S. Marshal's Office and several other area agencies joined in the.[2015-04-07] Alt.Binz 0.40.0 BETA[2014-10-24] Alt.Binz 0.39.15.9[2013-08-13] Alt.Binz 0.39.14[2013-07-02] Alt.Binz 0.39.13

EMS Electronic Muscle Stimulator - NMS Neuromuscular Stimulation or NMES
Electronic Muscle Stimulator (EMS) or Neuromuscular Stimulator (NMS) are also known as Neuromuscular Electrical Stimulation (NMES) which are used to stimulate muscle contractions to treat certain medical conditions. By attaching Electrodes to the skin near the muscles to be stimulated, Electrical Muscle Stimulation simulates the nervous system impulse coming from the brain. Muscle stimulation by external electrical impulses was first documented in 1791 by Luigi Galvani who experimented with NMS Neuromuscular Stimulation upon frogs. NMES Neuromuscular Electrical experimentation with Olympic and professional athletes has found that Neuromuscular Stimulation can improve endurance and muscle mass. In medical applications, Neuromuscular Stimulators are often used to rehabilitate patients recovering from surgery, accidents and other injuries. When using NMS Neuromuscular Stimulator Devices for medical purposes, Electro Muscle Stimulation provides for reducing muscle spasm, preventing atrophy, increasing blood circulation, muscle re-education, preventing venous thrombosis, and increasing range of motion. EMS Electronic Muscle Stimulators have also been found useful in the treatment of chronic pain. EMS Devices are often called TENS Units.

I ponder in Shock
Rock
At least mine has 11 words.
Actually, I just tried my hands on cinquain, a form of poetry with just 5 lines and 11 words. As evident from my composition,
Line 1 has just one word, i.e. the title; line 2 has two words that describe the title; line 3 has three words that tell the action; line 4 has four words that express the feeling; and line 5 has one word which recalls the title.
It need not rhyme. Nonetheless, I composed a rhyming cinquain. An achievement indeed, for a blogger who claims to be experiencing a block as massive as a rock!
P.S.
1. Before someone objects to my tampering with the semantics, I must admit that the action in line 3 and the feelings expressed in line 4 should be of the same subject. However, in my poem, while action is performed by the clock, the feeling is mine. Now that's what they call poetic licence, isn't it!
2. Cinquain has many variants which can be checked here, here, here and here.

The memorial events for late Israeli prime minister Ariel Sharon, who died Saturday, were underway Monday morning with a memorial ceremony held in front of the Knesset, Israel's parliament building.
The special memorial ceremony was attended by family members, politicians and world leaders, including US Vice President Joe Biden, former British prime minister and member of the Middle East Quartet Tony Blair, as well as Israeli President Shimon Peres and Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, Xinhua reported.
Biden, who was one of the most senior figures to attend the ceremony, said he knew Sharon from 30 years ago, and understood why people called him a "bulldozer".
"He was built in a strong way. When I met him as a young senator it was impossible not to notice that he has the presence of a commander," Biden said.
"Sharon was a complex man who lived in complex times in a complex neighbourhood," he said.
"Like all historic leaders, he had a North Star that guided him - his North Star was the survival of the state of Israel and the Jewish people," Biden added.
Commenting on the current relations between Israel and the US, he said: "As (US) President Obama said when he was here in Jerusalem, whoever rejects Israel's right of existence can just as easily reject the fact there's land under our feet. Israel is not going anywhere, and as long as the United States is here, you're not alone."
"Sharon left us too early, but the effort to (establish) peace would continue," Biden concluded.
Tony Blair, who worked with Sharon when the two were prime ministers in the early 2000s, also spoke at the memorial service.
"Sharon took actions that no one thought he would take - the road map and the disengagement from Gaza - but his strategy remained one - to protect the country for which he had fought for generations," he said.
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said Sharon's impressive military service, from the war of independence to the war of Yom Kippur, showed his courage and his major contribution to Israel's security.
"As a prime minister and a minister he insisted on our right to act to defend ourselves in order to live here in security, a right we insist upon and is a necessary condition for our existence and for the existence of peace," Netanyahu added.
He also talked about the difference of opinions the two had, especially on the topic of the disengagement from the Gaza Strip in 2005, which Netanyahu had vehemently opposed.
"I had not always agreed with Arik (as Sharon was also called) and he didn't always agree with me, but when he served in my government and I served in his, we worked together in cooperation for the security of Israel and its economy," Netanyahu said.
Israeli President Shimon Peres talked about his long time acquaintance with Sharon, and called him "the shoulder on whom Israel's security rested" and his major contribution to the country throughout the main cornerstones of its existence.
"When I met Arik... I felt that before me stood an extraordinary man with the desire and the rare quality to serve his people until the end," Peres said.

(Posted on 13-01-2014)Remember how “True Blood” ended last August? The Vampire Authority compound is in flames. Bill Compton (Stephen Moyer) drinks all the sacred blood supposedly preserved from Lilith (Jessica Clark), the mother of all vampires. Then Bill gruesomely dies the “true death” and reincarnates as a far-more-powerful version of who knows what.
Has he become a god? A devil? That’s the burning question as Season 6 of the popular HBO series launches with Episode 61: “Who are You, Really?”
The action picks up right where it left off, at the compound turned fiery slaughterhouse. Fleeing the carnage are Sookie Stackhouse (Anna Paquin), her brother Jason (Ryan Kwanten), vampire Eric Northman (Alexander Skarsgård), his “sister” Nora (Lucy Griffiths) and vamps Jessica (Deborah Ann Woll), Tara (Rutina Wesley) and Pam (Kristin Bauer van Straten).
PHOTOS: 'True Blood' Season 6 premiere
The compound explodes with Bill inside but he emerges very much intact, “like a naked, evil Superman,” as Jason puts it. Has Bill’s troubled spirit merged with Lilith?
“If Lilith is walking the earth — in any form — we have to destroy her,” Nora insists. What? Kill Bill? Or Bilith?
That’s just what Sookie attempts when Bill starts to strangle Eric. She plunges a stake into Bill’s back but it’s a mere annoyance. It’ll take a lot more than that to knock this super vamp off the show.
Now the only character remaining loyal to Bill is his young progeny, Jessica.
“I don’t know what I am. I don’t know why I am,” Bill confesses to Jessica. “I need you to keep me honest,” he implores, so his newfound powers don’t turn him into a monster. Jessica agrees, but it’s a huge responsibility for a baby vamp.
Meanwhile, Louisiana Gov. Truman Burrell (Arliss Howard) declares war on vampires, who increasingly prey on humans because synthetic TruBlood is in short supply. “Buy a gun. Buy as many guns as you can,” the Governor urges his non-vampire constituents. “Stock up on wooden bullets.”
Definitely a man with a plan, the governor approaches a TruBlood manufacturer and offers use of a shuttered bottling factory. With TruBlood back on the market, vampires would once again become peaceful, taxpaying members of society, he figures. And the crafty politician would rake in lots of reelection cash.
SECTION: Summer TV Sneaks
After the governor imposes a nighttime curfew on vampires and shuts down their businesses, his troops raid the Fangtasia vamp bar and shoot feisty Tara. Good thing she’s got regenerative powers.
Meanwhile, back in bucolic Bon Temps, restaurateur Sam Merlotte (Sam Trammell) mourns the loss of girlfriend Luna (Janina Gavankar), a “shapeshifter” who died while escaping the Authority. Sam enlists the help of flamboyant short-order cook Lafayette (Nelsan Ellis) to care for Luna’s werewolf child, Emma (Chloe Noelle). Major bonding ensues.
As for Sheriff Andy Bellefleur (Chris Bauer) — who sired those half-human, half-faerie quadruplets with oh-so-fertile Maurella (Kristina Anapau) — he’s overcome with new daddy anxiety.
“I don’t know how to take care of my own babies. That’s the sad truth,” admits Andy, who receives diapering lessons from cousin Terry (Todd Lowe) and his wife Arlene (Carrie Preston). Those cute little girls, by the way, are growing at an incredible speed. At this rate, they’ll progress from kindergarten to college in a couple of episodes.
Finally, Jason makes a strange new acquaintance when hitchhiking home. The eerie driver (Rutger Hauer) seems to know all about the ill-fated Stackhouse clan, including the murder of Jason and Sookie’s parents by Warlow, an ancient and mysterious vampire.
“You cannot keep Warlow away from Sookie,” the driver hisses before disappearing in a flash of light. Yikes!

Pfizer acquired Meningitec as part of its $68 million purchase of Wyeth in 2009.
Nuron Biotech Inc. acquired a vaccine product called Meningitec from Pfizer Inc. on Monday.
Financial terms of the deal were not disclosed.
Meningitec, which is registered in 23 countries throughout the world, is a vaccine used to prevent disease caused by Neisseria meningitidis serogroup C. — a major cause of infectious disease worldwide A majority of N. meningitidis cases occur in children and can lead to meningitis, sepsis and pneumonia. The infectious disease has a 90 percent mortality rate when left untreated,
“Meningitec is a tremendous opportunity to expand Nuron Biotech’s portfolio with a commercially successful vaccine with an established market,” said Shankar Musunuri, founder and CEO of the Exton, Pa., biopharmaceutical company. “The addition of Meningitec represents an important milestone toward bringing innovative biologics and vaccines to patients with unmet needs around the world.”
Richard C. Dinovitz, vice president of marketing and business development at Nuron, said the company plans bring the vaccine to markets with unvaccinated and under-vaccinated populations.
More than 50 million doses of Meningitec have been distributed in countries, including France, Germany, Spain, Greece and Australia since its launch in 1999.
Pfizer (NYSE: PFE) acquired Meningitec as part of its $68 million purchase of Wyeth in 2009.
Nuron acquired announced Wyeth vaccine HibTITER, designed to prevent infection by the Haemophilus influenza type b bacteria, from Pfizer two years ago.Acrylic and enamel on board, 32 x 22 inches.

Given our busy weekday schedules, my wife and I spend most weekends taking care of our six-month old daughter, Natalia. Aside from the usual weekly shenanigans (playing with toys, introducing semi-solid food, getting her acquainted with our dog), one of her favourite activities would be to watch TV. She seems to like music shows on the Korean channel M, as well as the Law & Order and CSI episodes on Fox Crime HD. It’s a bit of an eclectic taste (but probably not unlike mine) and all this is possible thanks to superfast broadband connectivity.
If you are in the UK, BT is right up there on top of the list of broadband providers. With speeds at 8-times the UK average, users are guaranteed unlimited access with BT’s unlimited broadband plans. It’s not uncommon these days for ISPs to tie-in content with their offerings and BT’s will make sport fans really happy, as their broadband packages come with BT Sport, featuring 38 Premier League live matches, WTA Tennis and many more.
Having superfast broadband around is helpful especially when I’ve to stream something like the entire season 1 of My Little Pony (it’s on YouTube, surprisingly) onto my iPad to serve as a distraction to Natalia. BT has this covered as well in the form of a powerful Home Hub router with support for both 2.4 GHz and 5 GHz wireless bands. If you are on the move, you can access BT Wi-Fi, which comprises 5 million public hotspots in the UK. And to ensure that your data stays wherever you go, BT provides BT Cloud online storage.
Pretty cool stuff this. I can certainly appreciate a fast Internet connection, and if you feel likewise (and are living in the UK), head over to BT Broadband to check out the various plans available.Powered by Sidelines

Thank you for using justanswer
You should treat your former employee as a contact worker and report her earnings on a 1099R since as you said you do not direct her daily activities
As for the $650 fee for a work permit, I can't find that $ amount in any of the information I have in my files or on the web
However, you may negotiate paying this for her (and include it in her 1099)
Are there payments that have to made to the Japanese gov't if she is working as a 1099 employee remotely?
Let me check the treaty first\
please give me a minute
ok
No, there's nothing in the treaty, and frankly, I've never heard of the US paying another country to allow a US citizen to be self employed in another country
Generally, a US company pays to bring people from other countries (H1B) visas
not to allow someone to be self employed there
That's what I thought. If she was a W2 employee it might be a different matter as then you get into if our company is trying to establish a presence, etc.
exactly
Ok, great, you confirmed my suspicions! Thanks.

Perpignan, 8 March (Argus) — German utility Eon will build the largest biomass-fired power plant in France, after receiving approval for the 150MW facility from the French government this week.
The plant will be built in Meyreuil, Provence, and is slated to be on line by the end of 2015 as Eon phases out its existing coal-fired Provence 4 station on the same site. The company must close Provence 4 by 1 January 2016 to comply with tighter French environmental controls.
The combined heat and power (CHP) facility will produce 970 GWh/yr and an unspecified amount of heat production for the local municipality and plant site, with its power generation sold into the regional grid.
The plant will consume 720,000 t/yr of wood feedstock, with 360,000 t/yr of this expected to be imported industrial wood pellets transported to the site from the southern port of Fos-sur-Mer. The remaining 360,000 t/yr will be sourced from local forest cover.
But the size of the procurement operation has led to French energy minister Eric Besson setting up a new biomass committee, controlled by local lawmakers, covering the Provence-Cote D'Azur region.
“This is a project without precedent in renewable energy in France,” Besson said. “We had to take particular care over any issues surrounding the procurement of this amount of wood locally. The new committee we are setting up will oversee this important task of a trouble-free collection of biomass for energy.”
The plant is one of 15 facilities approved by Besson on 6 March in the country's fourth bidding round for biomass-fired plants, which was its largest so far in capacity terms, with projects totalling 421MW. The previous largest round was the second round approved in 2010, which saw a total of 22 projects approved with a capacity of 308MW. The first bidding round saw 138MW from eight projects with 266MW from 31 projects in the third.
France must increase the pace of installation as three projects from the first bidding round and 19 of the 22 from the second round remain in planning or under construction, according to Besson.

Despite record year, theme-park operator records accounting loss
$380
SeaWorld’s core earnings for 2011, in millions
SeaWorld Parks & Entertainment had a banner year in 2011. Attendance and guest spending rose across its U.S. theme parks. Earnings set a company record.
But the Orlando-based theme-park operator won’t have to pay a dime in federal income tax. Thanks to big tax deductions for capital investment and interest payments, SeaWorld’s record 2011 will actually go down as a loss for tax purposes.
In fact, it.
Each of its three SeaWorld marine parks had attendance gains, Jacobs told the U-T last month. After suffering through two years of declining attendance, SeaWorld San Diego reported a 14 percent gain last year, the highest of any of the marine parks.
SeaWorld. The study was conducted by the liberal-leaning advocacy groups Citizens for Tax Justice and the Institute on Taxation and Economic Policy. About one in every 10 achieved negative tax rates.
SeaWorld has been able to erase its income-tax liability largely by claiming high depreciation, which lets firms deduct from taxable income the cost of building or buying long-lasting assets — such as theme-park attractions — during a period of time.

-Piston Computing plans to build a bridge to EMC VMware's Cloud Foundry, meaning it will link Piston's own OpenStack-based cloud IaaS offering. What does this mean for cloud development? It's the start of many other such integration efforts, I suspect, to battle the meteoric rise of Amazon Web Services (AWS).
Cloud Foundry is a popular open source platform service, which VMware promotes as a PaaS for any infrastructure. Piston is one of many companies that rely on OpenStack. The OpenStack fraternity includes Akamai, AMD, Broadcom, Cisco Systems, CloudScaling, Dell, Hewlett-Packard, Intel, NTT, Rackspace, and Yahoo. The OpenStack movement is really a competitive pushback on AWS in the IaaS space. Both Cloud Foundry and Piston's OpenStack are available under the Apache 2 license.
[. ]
If you're working on an enterprise cloud computing strategy, you should be well aware that relationships such as the Piston/VMware deal are forged for the economic benefit of both companies by making the combination more attractive than either offering on its own. That's why we'll see more and more such IaaS/PaaS partnerships or even acquisitions in the next 18 months -- especially involving other OpenStack providers.
The rationale is obvious: AWS is eating everyone's lunch, so now is the time to pile on. If AWS were not doing so well in the market, you wouldn't see many of these partnerships -- trust me.
What's an enterprise cloud guy to do? Use these partnerships to your advantage. No matter what the motivation, they open up new paths to cloud computing success, both private and public. As everyone teams up to defeat AWS, the prices should fall and the breadth of the technology stacks should increase.
Thanks for being so ominous, AWS!

For Rubio, this is the week he formally disses the tea party movement, which was useful to him in getting elected, but which won’t help him become vice president or president. Rubio now says there’s no need for a tea party caucus in the Senate, so he (like Pat Toomey) is not joining.
Meanwhile, Rubio’s political godfather Jeb Bush is floating a novel idea for reforming the state pension systems: eliminate defined benefit pensions altogether. Golden parachutes for CEOs, not so much…
So what is El Unico up to? He announced that he is an original sponsor of a Senate bill to repeal healthcare reform. Good times.
As for Rubio’s housemate and pal David Rivera, Speaker John Boehner finally addressed the investigation of his most unfortunate freshman, though he didn’t say much, and Politico reports the House leadership is none too pleased with Rivera’s failure to be forthcoming about his legal troubles. Rubio, meanwhile, has become a lot less palsy-walsy with the guy he bought a house with back in the day. This as state Democrats and Republicans begin drawing up plans for a possible Rivera exit from Congress.
A reporter spends the day with Gollum, and finds that now that he’s elected, the Florida governor plans to spend lots of time in Washington grabbing for evil federal spending.
And we finally know the origins of that damned beach piano.

Utah’s oldest standing industrial building, the Chase Mill stands as a symbol of the past and a beautiful venue to celebrate the future. The Chase Mill is open to the public during Tracy Aviary’s regular business hours, except in the case of private reservations.
Designed by Isaac Chase and Frederick Kesler and originally built as a grist mill, construction on the Chase Mill began in 1848. The water-powered mill operated from 1852-1879, and helped Utah’s early settlers survive the great famine in 1856-1857 by providing flour to families at no charge.

Some key points to note in a Balance Sheet:
So your chocolate business that you have started uses raw materials to manufacture chocolates (such as sugar, cocoa, dry fruits, milk powder, etc.), this raw material may not be fully used to the extent you have purchased in the production process â€“ the unused material becomes work-in-progress inventory for this period and will be used in next period.
Suppose you have produced 10000 units of chocolates (yumm!) but are able to sell only 8000 units, the remaining 2000 units becomes the finished inventory. Donâ€™t eat up all your finished inventory!!
It is very obvious that to increase your market share and to become a known brand you will work hard to push your product and for that you may need to sell products on credit (at least initially). This credit sale to your distributors is called account receivables because you have to receive money in future.
In the business you may meet contingencies so you maintain cash. Even cash is generated in the course of business. How it is generated we will seen in the next article on Cash Flow Statement!
Because inventories, account receivables can be quickly converted into cash and cash in itself is a liquid asset, they all come under the current assets in the balance sheet.
The plant and equipment you are using to produce chocolates are your fixed assets i.e. non-current assets.
The current and non-current assets are the left hand side of your organizationâ€™s balance sheet.
There is a possibility that you may purchase some of the raw-materials needed to produce chocolates on credit from your suppliers, even there may be a possibility that you may not fully pay to your workers in a period due to some constraints â€“ all these transactions will become your current liabilities.
Talking about the capital structure if you have borrowed funds to start your business, it will come under non-current liabilities as debt. And the fund you have contributed in your business is the equity and in the period if your business has made any profit which has not been distributed as dividends to owners; it will be added to equity as retained earnings.
The liabilities and equity are the right hand side of the balance sheet.
Remember, the left and right side of the balance sheet should always be equal.
You can draw the real Balance Sheet by downloading the attached excel sheet.
Step 1: Get the cash balance information from the Cash Flow Statement (CF) and add to the balance sheet
Step 2: Sum cash balance and other given current assets together
Step 3: Get the Gross Plant & Equipment information from the Asset & Depreciation Schedule and add to the balance sheet.
Step 4: Get Accumulated Depreciation information from the Asset & Depreciation Schedule and add to the balance sheet.
Accumulated Depreciation = sum of depreciationâ€™s on an asset till date.
Step 5: Calculate the Net Plant & Equipment
*Negative numbers are in bracket
Step 6: Add all non-current assets together
Step 7: Calculate the Total Assets
Total Assets = Current Assets + Non-current Assets
Calculation of left hand side of the above mentioned equation is finished, now let start the equationâ€™s right side calculation.
Step 8: Sum all the given current liabilities together
Step 9: Sum all the given non-current liabilities together
Step 10: Calculate the Total Liabilities
Total Liabilities = Current Liabilities + Non-current Liabilities
Step 11: Calculate the retained earnings
Closing Retained Earning = Beginning Retained Earnings + Net Income â€“ Dividends paid
Step 12: Link the retained earnings to the balance sheet
Step 13: Calculate the Total Equity
Step 14: Calculate the Total Liabilities & Equities

The reason is pretty simple, I think they do a better job explaining what we see on the court than traditional statistics. But if this is all new to you, here is a little primer.
Let’s start with the most basic of questions: What wins basketball games? Obviously, scoring more points than your opponents — it’s been that way since the day James Naismith nailed up the peach baskets. However, by the basic rules of basketball, you and your opponents will have the same number of possessions per game, so what really is the key is being more efficient in your possessions than your opponent.
The best way to compare offenses and defenses is on a level playing field, meaning in points scored per possession. To make that a more easily digestible number, we talk about points scored/given up per 100 possessions (which is slightly more than in the average NBA game). We call that number offensive/defensive rating. For example, if for each 100 possessions the Lakers are averaging 105.4 points, that is their offensive rating. If they are giving up 102.9 points per 100 possessions to their opponents, then they would be a slightly better than .500 team.
Points per possession is a better barometer of a team than points scored per game because the latter is influenced by the pace games are played at (pace can be measured separately).
The next logical question is what factors lead to scoring on a possession? And, its corollary question, what can be done to stop an opponent from scoring?
Dean Oliver, in his groundbreaking book Basketball on Paper, says there are really only four ways to create offense on the team level: shoot accurately, don’t turn the ball over, grab offensive rebounds, and get to the free throw line. These things are often called “the four factors.” These things are not equal — shooting efficiency is twice as important and limiting turnovers and getting offensive rebounds. Getting to the free throw line is the least important.
How well you defend those four areas gives a good picture of a team’s defense.
Some people will ask if these statistics are valid. I’d obviously answer yes. In the same way that baseball statistics are valid because of the number of trials (a starting major leaguer gets more than 500 at bats per season, for example) basketball stats are also valid. There are 82 games a season and that means most teams have upwards of 7,400 offensive possessions per season. A star player like Kobe Bryant may take upwards of 1,100 shot per season but even a role player will take hundreds (381). The volume is there to make valid analysis.
One stat we use around here is John Hollinger’s PER, or Player Efficiency Rating. It is not the end all/be all of a stat, but it is a nice snapshot. I’ll let Hollinger explain PER (from his site):
The formula, which I call the Player Efficiency Rating (PER), adds the good (made shots, steals, assists, rebounds, blocked shots, free throws), and subtracts the bad (missed shots, turnovers, fouls) by assigning a point value to each item (I arrive at the point values in a fairly tortuous way, and that’s one of the parts I’m saving for the book). The rating for each player is then adjusted to a per-minute basis (so that, for example, you can compare subs with starters in the frequent ‘he should start ahead of so-and-so’ debates), and also adjusted for the team’s pace. In the end, one number sums up the players’ accomplishments (the statistical ones, anyway) for that season. I’ve set it up so that the league average, every season, is 15.00, which produces sort of a handy reference guide:
Over at the site 82games.com, they produce an oPER or Opponents Player Efficiency Ratings. This is the same as PER, but done to whomever a player is guarding to give you an idea of the defensive performance of a player. This is a flawed system when applied to one player because of zone coverages, switch offs and the rest of the way defense is played in the NBA. However, oPER it works pretty well when applied to a position. For example, if the Lakers are allowing an oPER of 10.9 against opponents shooting guards, well below the league average of 15, then they defend that spot well. However, they are getting burned at the three, say an oPER of 18.9, then we have a problem.
Other stats seen around these parts.
eFG% or Effective Field Goal Percentage. The problem with basic/traditional field goal percentage, particularly when talking about guards, is that it counts a made three-pointer the same as a made two pointer — the equivalent of a football stat that counted touchdowns and field goals as the same. Clearly those are not worth the same amount, and neither is a two-pointer and a three-pointer in basketball — a three-pointer is worth 50% more on the scoreboard. So eFG% gives players that bonus (50%) for making the more difficult shot (the equation can be seen as eFG% = (2PM + 1.5*3PM) / FGA or eFG% = (FGM + 3PM/2)/FGA).
+/- Numbers. One of the best gauges of a player’s worth to a specific team comes from looking at the difference in how the team plays with the player on court versus performance with the player off court. The on court +/- number represents the team’s net points with the player on the floor per 48 minutes, while the off court number is the team’s net with the player off the floor per 48 minutes.

Embraceable, he’s not. Why, there are guys working out of the trunks of cars who might back away from this perceived-in-certain-circles slickster who just happens to coach the best college basketball team in America.
That, of course, would be the Kentucky Wildcats, who’ll take on the Kansas Jayhawks in this evening’s NCAA Tournament title bout at the Mercedes-Benz Superdome, where some 70,000 people will collect not to watch a competition as much as to observe a coronation.
Yes, yes, yes. A thousand times yes. The Syracuse University Orange, with Fab Melo in the middle, might have had a chance against Kentucky and its wave of semipros. But barring some kind of cosmic development, Kansas likely doesn’t.
Which means that by night’s end, Calipari -- should his Wildcats figure out Thomas Robinson, a difficult task but not one beyond their immense collective capability -- will wear both the metamorphic crown and a championship smile. And that won’t sit well with a lot of folks who believe that here is a man who is leading the college game straight to hell on a ball rack.
"I’m not worried about my legacy," Calipari announced on Sunday afternoon. "I don’t need to explain myself to my friends. They don’t need to hear it. The others don’t need to hear it. Some like you; some don’t. I’m not here for a popularity contest."
This is a good thing because outside of the Commonwealth (and in some pockets within it), that would be a contest the 53-year-old Calipari would lose.
There was, you may recall, that little matter at Massachusetts involving payments by outsiders to Marcus Camby that resulted in the Minutemen’s Final Four appearance in 1996 being vacated by the NCAA. And there was also that untidy situation at Memphis regarding Derrick Rose’s dubious SAT score that ended with the Tigers having their Final Four doings of 2008 excised from the NCAA record books.
And while it’s true that Calipari -- who tries to attend daily Mass and whose inner circle includes more than a few priests -- was not implicated in either case, he was at the wheel at both schools. And that has invited more than a bit of mistrust.
And now? Well, now Calipari is at Kentucky where "one-and-dones" are invited to throw in on the Lexington campus for a few months and sample a smidge of university life around their basketball responsibilities before moving onto the NBA where their true purposes in life await. That is, dribbling for dollars.
"I don’t apologize," Calipari offered. "It’s not my rule. I don’t like the rule (which mandates that high-school graduates must attend college for a year, but are free to leave for the NBA after those two semesters). And there are only two solutions to it: I can recruit players who are not as good as the players I’m recruiting or I can try to convince guys that should leave to stay for me."
And then . . .
"I mean, you know, Steve Jobs left," he said. "Bill Gates left. The integrity of their schools was at stake when they left. I guess they should have stayed and not changed the world."
Calipari will tell you that he has six starters in the persons of freshmen Anthony Davis, Michael Kidd-Gilchrist and Marquis Teague; sophomores Terrence Jones and Doran Lamb; and senior Darius Miller, who together stand three inches over 39 feet, have compiled a record of 37-2 and include, remarkably, not a single shooter who averages as many as 9.2 heaves per game.
And he’ll insist that each and every one of them is a first-round NBA draft pick.
This means two things: (a) the underdog Jayhawks have a major chore this evening, and (b) Kentucky could look a whole lot different come the end of the month, by which time underclassmen must declare their professional intentions.
While Calipari, no fool, won’t publicly cluck about the former, neither will he sweat the latter. Life is, after all, what life is. And there are always those Nerlens Noels out there who are eager to fill the spots left vacant by those who defect.
"North Carolina just had three guys leave early, maybe more," Calipari said. "Duke had one. That is bad for college basketball? Is it these guys (his Wildcats) who are bad for college basketball? I don’t know. All I’m doing is I’m doing what’s right for these people, helping them reach their dreams.
"But I tell them, ‘Do not come with me if you think you’re leaving after one year. You come with me if you think you’re staying with me two years, minimum. You’re going to class, you’re going to be educated. An educated man does not get robbed or fooled.’ So, our kids come and they understand that."
At least they do as they walk through Calipari’s door. For some, though, that door is a revolving one, which doesn’t seem to bother Kentucky fans all that much. As for all those others who find this fella a touch oily? Calipari shrugs. This isn’t, remember, a popularity contest. And it wasn’t a popularity contest at UMass or Memphis, either.
So? So, for much of the country, that won’t necessarily be Bill Self over there on the Kansas bench tonight. That’ll be Pop Fisher.
.)Body Weight, Varsity Sports Linked to ALS-->
Sept. 9, 2002 -- Ever since the career of baseball great Lou Gehrig was cut short by ALS, the disease has been forever linked to elite athletes. But a new study suggests that slim, athletic individuals may actually be more likely to develop diseases that gradually erode muscle strength, such as ALS.
Diseases that affect the nerves that control muscles -- including ALS -- are called motor neuron diseases. Researchers found that people who had always been slim were more than twice as likely to develop motor neuron diseases than those who were heavier. And varsity athletes were 1.7 times more likely to develop these diseases later in life.
For the study, researchers compared 279 people with motor neuron disease to a similar group of 152 people with other diseases that affect the brain and nervous system. The results appear in the September issue of Neurology.
According to the CDC, only about 14% of the general population participated in physical activities and even fewer reach the level of varsity athletics. But the study authors found 38% of their patients with motor neuron diseases had been varsity athletes, compared with 27% of the comparison group.
Researchers say they aren't sure why there's a higher concentration of motor neuron disease among top athletes. But they suggest that vigorous physical activity might somehow increase exposure to environmental toxins or make it easier for the brain and body to absorb these toxins. Another possible explanation may be that the added physical stress of being an elite athlete might make them more susceptible to disease.
However, the study authors caution that these results are only preliminary and should not in any way discourage people from participating in sports.
"Thousands and thousands of slim athletes never develop ALS. Why a tiny few of them do develop ALS is still unknown," according to study researcher Nikolaos Scarmeas, MD, of Columbia University, and colleagues. "There is certainly no justification to avoid athletics in attempts to avoid motor neuron diseases."
In addition, the researchers say there is nothing in their study to suggest that people with ALS should not exercise or be as well nourished as possible.1. THERE IS NO EVIDENCE
The Obama administration has said it will take military action against Syria in response to an alleged chemical weapons attack that it has yet to present any evidence of, let alone who carried it out. Some in the administration were even saying that the alleged attack may not have been ordered by Syrian President Bashar Al Assad but a rogue element in the regime. The Al Qaeda affiliated groups in the Syrian opposition, now the strongest groups militarily, are not only capable of but have allegedly carried out a chemical attack in the past.
2. THEY ARE ILLEGAL
Such an attack, no matter how limited, would be illegal under international law without approval of the UN Security Council (UNSC). The U.S. insists it doesn't need UNSC approval and is not even putting it to a vote. The British government, the main U.S. ally, was unable to win approval for military action from its parliament. Even the Arab League, which includes Saudi Arabia and Qatar--the main funders and backers of the Syrian opposition--is divided and has been unable to issue a statement of support. This is why the administration decided to obtain Congressional approval, although it has also said, if necessary, it will carry out the attack without that approval. Even with Congressional approval, an attack would still be illegal.
3. THEY KEEP US IN ENDLESS WAR
If the U.S. attacks Syria, it will be the 6th Country (Afghanistan, Iraq, Pakistan, Yemen, and Libya) the U.S. has intervened in militarily in the past 10 years alone. Every one of these interventions turned into a (drone) war and, in some cases, an occupation in which hundreds of thousands were killed and many more injured. The U.S. has spent billions on these wars and sacrificed thousands of U.S. soldiers and yet these countries are less stable and equal than they were before the U.S. intervened. An average of 700 Iraqis, mostly Shi’a, have died every month since April from bombs placed in crowded public areas. The inability of the government to secure large parts of the country means that we could see a similar situation in Afghanistan once U.S. troops completely withdraw in 2014.
4. THEY WILL MEAN MORE DEAD AND DISPLACED
A military attack on Syria will lead to the death, already at more than 100,000, and immiseration of even more Syrians. There is a chance that the regime’s chemical weapons storage sites, which are located in or near urban centers, will be hit by a U.S. attack or a rebel offensive that is sure to follow such an attack. Those who aren’t killed or injured will have their homes or livelihoods destroyed, adding to what has become one of the largest refugee populations in the world. There are now roughly 2 million externally displaced refugees, half of whom are children, and close to 5 million who are internally displaced. Thus nearly a third of the population has been forced from their home. Even the threat of an attack will increase the number of refugees if it hasn’t already.
5. THEY COULD START A REGIONAL WAR
U.S. military intervention will further destabilize an already unstable region and could lead to a regional war that would have a detrimental effect on the world. The sectarian divisions the U.S. exploited--particularly between Sunnis and Shi’a-- to maintain its occupation of Iraq have enveloped the entire region and brought Iraq to the verge of a civil war. Saudi Arabia and Qatar have used their petro dollars and media empires to spread and deepen this sectarianism to mobilize jihadists from around the world to come to fight the “Iran backed” (code word for Shi’a) Assad regime. This has not only led to Sunni attacks on Christians, Shi’a, and Alawis in Syria but to what could be called pogroms against the Shi’a in Pakistan and Iraq. A series of car bombings targeting Shi’a in Lebanon followed by bombings of Sunni mosques have raised the spectre of another bloody civil war. Israel, likely the main source of the chemical weapons allegations, has already bombed Syria and continues to push for war on Iran.
THERE IS AN ALTERNATIVE
First and foremost, the millions of dollars that were going to be spent on bombing Syria could be used to provide real safe havens and relief for the millions of Syrian refugees, as Sweden demonstrated when it granted blanket amnesty to Syrian refugees and their families. Secondly, there needs to be an immediate arms embargo on Syria by all sides. Thirdly, a peace conference needs to be convened where all sides are brought to the table. This has yet to even be attempted. For a more detailed list of what the U.S. can do, see Phyllis Bennis’s article “Striking Syria: Illegal, Immoral, and Dangerous”

Used this glaze on my Christmas Ham and got rave reviews from family and friends. I also had some dried apricots and cherries that I diced very small and put in the pot. When I reduced my sauce they worked perfectly. I will use this glaze on more than just ham in the future. Thanks Kitten.

It just isn't Christmas to me without these songs. There are lots more I love, but these are probably my favorites...
10. This just makes me laugh
9. This was one of my favorite TV shows to watch. The Abominable scared me!
8. I remember when this came out and it is the first Christmas parody I ever heard
7. This one is pretty self-explanatory. We have all been there!
6. This one is just funny. My youngest daughter can sing it.
5. This one is clever and funny!
4. I like all songs by Trans-Siberian Orchestra, but Carol of the Bells is a favorite.
3. Beautiful voices and arrangement of a classic
2. Little Drummer Boy is my all time favorite song and Bob Seger nails it!
1. David Bowie has one of the most beautiful singing voices and this song is what Christmas is too me.
So, what are your favorites?
As a Canadian, I have to thank you for including Bob and Doug Mackenzie from The Great White North! I've always loved their portrayal of Canucks, eh.
My fav Christmas song collection is the entire soundtrack from National Lampoon's Christmas Vacation -- which sadly was never released as an album.
Bob and Doug were my favorite on SNL. I thought it was the funniest thing I had ever heard at the time :) love it! Eh?
Curse the firewall at work! They block youtube. *grumble*
oh no! look when you get home :) got some fun ones
Those were wonderful and I have to agree Bob Seger is really good, have always loved him. My husband and I were just talking about that Bing Crosby and David Bowie duet...I don't think there's anything more fitting for Christmas, they did an excellent job.
I could listen to the Bowie/Crosby song all day! absolutely beautiful :) and Bob Seger's version is so heartfelt.
I also like the David Bowie duet, but one of my favourite songs is Band Aid, with all the famous artists then, Do they know it's Christmas Time again? And of course: Last Christmas.
I like that one too! I have a CD with all my favorites. thanks for stopping by!To the editor:
With regard to the Dec. 15 commentary about the Nevada Public Employees Retirement System (“Nevada PERS report previews a slow-motion train wreck”), we appreciate that individuals may have differing perspectives regarding the retirement system. However, we feel the views expressed in the commentary present a one-sided perspective of the facts about the pension fund’s financing and the Aon Hewitt study requested by Gov. Brian Sandoval.
We believe any discussion of the report should mention its conclusions. Aon Hewitt found a number of conservative funding policies to be unique to Nevada PERS. These include PERS’ equal sharing of contributions between members and employers, its automatic reflection of actuarial gains and losses in contribution rates, and the PERS board’s recent decision to shorten liability amortization periods from 30 years to 20 years.
In addition, Aon Hewitt concluded that, “the actuarial funding policy, including its requirements regarding audits, benefit improvements, funding methodology and other details, represents a comprehensive, thoughtful and appropriate model that constitutes a best-in-class policy that many other systems do not have.”
One of the most attractive features of a responsibly funded pension plan is its ability to finance benefits over a member’s entire lifetime. This can cover over 50 years of both employment and retirement. As a result, a focus on investment returns over a short period of time, especially a period that included the worst bear market for risk assets in 80 years, provides an incomplete picture of potential performance.
When we review results over longer periods, PERS’ returns are in line with long-term objectives. For the period that ended Sept. 30, PERS’ 25-year return is 8.3 percent, and its since-inception return (about 29 years) is 9.5 percent. Results for these periods are competitive with other large institutional investors, ranking in the top 10 percent among all funds on a risk-adjusted return basis.

UNLV stadium
To the editor:
In response to the UNLV stadium article Monday (“Stadium consultant emphasizes value of venue”), I was delighted to read that Mark Rosentraub, a former critic of large stadium projects, has switched teams — excuse the pun — and is such an enthusiastic supporter of the new stadium proposal for UNLV. Collecting a $300-per-hour consulting fee from taxpayers, er, UNLV, couldn’t possibly have influenced his opinion.
Most encouraging is Mr. Rosentraub’s projection of badly needed commercial and residential development in the area. With thousands of acres of vacant land surrounding UNLV, it would be nice if students could find an apartment or a place to grab a bite to eat somewhere nearby. Except for attending meetings, it is unlikely that any of the most enthusiastic supporters of this boondoggle have any personal skin in the game. If the stadium turns out to be a flop, becoming another millstone around taxpayers’ necks, supporters can simply walk away saying, “It seemed like a good idea at the time.”
Why not require supporters to each deposit $100,000 of their own money into an escrow account. As soon as the stadium is generating a true profit, these funds can then be returned to them with interest.
If only we had facilities such as Cashman Field, Sam Boyd Stadium, the Thomas &Mack Center, and large arenas such as The Orleans, MGM Grand and South Point, we might not be in such desperate need of this new stadium.

Leading by example
To the editor:
In the past few weeks, there have been numerous articles and letters about Sen. Harry Reid exempting some of his staffers from the Affordable Care Act.
My parents taught me this principle: Just because it’s legal doesn’t necessarily make it the right choice. Later in life, I learned one of the foundations of good leadership and management is to lead by example.
If Obamacare is good for all our citizens, then everyone in Congress who voted for it should mandate their employees use it, too.
That is leadership by example.

Check it out. We’ve got a new film.

Cab Kapow!
4 May 2012
With the rain in London just refusing to stop, a story partly set in London, a narrator guided by a London mini-cab driver, well, we thought where better to film Adam Thirlwell talking about his new book Kapow! than in the back of a London cab?
Kapow! A Great Story. That is Also Great Looking
26 April 2012
So we realised that we’ve been banging on about how Great Looking our new book, Kapow! by Adam Thirlwell is, but not sharing too much about the Story itself. Which aside from being Great Looking, is also seriously Great. It’s the kind of can’t put it down even though the bath water’s turning cold and your skin’s going all crinkly kind of Great. The need to pee but you keep reading on with ever more crossed legs kind of Great.
Kapow! in Pics
20 April 2012
Advance copies of Kapow! by Adam Thirlwell landed in our studio on Monday, quite fittingly chiming with the start of the London Book Fair. And boy oh boy are we excited. The book feels real, is beautiful to hold and touch, it works and is giving people the giggles in all the right places. So far.
Houston, We Have a Cover. Houston, We Have Stopped Falling
23 March 2012
Okay, so this week we went beyond falling off the production cliff and we just kept falling. We thought we had tried it all before with Tree of Codes. What could be more difficult, right. Alas, we were proved wrong by Kapow! (fitting, really, for a book with that title too).
What Is it About Book Covers?
12 March 2012
We’ve all been working overtime (sleepless nights, shower epiphanies, five minute naps sitting upright) on Adam Thirlwell’s Kapow! And we’re nearly nearly there. The inside is pretty sorted. It’s beautiful. And insane. And everyone’s feeling it.
Kapowing Kapow!
24 February 2012
Kapow! Kapow! Kapow! Kapow! Kapow! Kapow! Kapow! Kapow! Kapow! Kapow! Kapow!
That’s what we feel like shouting. From every single rooftop. And believe us, if we could, we would.
Gearing Up and Going Out
17 February 2012
We’ve always been suckers for putting a bit (a lot, if we’re honest) of loving into everything we do. And yesterday was more of just that with an old school production line printing, folding, trimming press releases to send out announcing our new book by Adam Thirlwell.
Dreams Really Do Come True
27 January 2012
It’s true, sometimes they do. And this week it feels like it. They can even happen in three’s, that’s for sure:
A Year of Revolutions
13 January 2012
We know we’ve been pretty quiet on the “hey hey, we’re back from the holidays” front.
But it’s not because we’re still rubbing the sofa-telly-over-eating/drinking/sleeping/skating/playing out of our eyes, but because we’ve well and truly landed in 2012 with our foot on the accelerator planning the launch of our fourth book, by Adam Thirlwell, out this coming May.
Jane Austen Matchmakers
12 April 2011
Remember those contracts we had designed and put a lot of love into a few weeks ago? We did a lot of talking about the contracts, but not much talking about who the contracts were with. Well, they’re all signed and the ink’s just about dry, so we can now tell you that we’ll be working with Adam Thirlwell on a brand new book due to come out early next year.
A new VE in the making
17 March 2011
We’ve just biked over author contracts for a new book. And we’re very, very excited. Giddy even. Before we tell you who it’s with (we’ll wait for the ink to dry before we do), we wanted to tell you a little something about the contract itself.Event Name- OR - Select an option below
Chef Cesare Cassela's latest venture on the Upper West Side is in conjunction with a big Italian cold cuts manufacturer, and his menu of wonderful small dishes feels grafted on to a tour-de-force of salumi and cheese. Even though the dining room at Salumeria Rosi Parmacotto is micro-sized, you'll feel like you've just stepped off the plane at Rome's DaVinci airport. What Cassela's lasagna lacks in size, it makes up for in flavor, and he's retained a slew of dishes from his Maremma days, including the cowboy short rib and brisket mired in polenta. Best of all, though, is his salad pantormo (greens stuck together with fine-textured scrambled eggs dotted with pancetta) and his seven-bean salad, in which he seems to have selected and individually cooked each bean.)

Previously, I posted a thread in "The Woodshed" entitled "What would you have for your last meal?" It involved death and gallows humor and I put it in "The Woodshed" for light-hearted answers. I put this particular thread in the Christian section because I was hoping for serious Christian answers.
I suppose the way I phrased the question (in an attempt to stimulate discussion) could be viewed as solipsistic; however, what I was trying to clarify with the follow-up questions was:
What scripture, hymns, sermons, etc. would you want at your funeral to convey to the people in attendance that there was some hope in this world in the face of death
.
I remember an anecdote told by Rev. Rod Rosenbladt about him preaching a funeral sermon at a cemetery near an affluent Southern California suburb (Irvine, if my memory serves me correctly - I think the cemetery was not in the city - the dead are not allowed in Irvine!) In any case, after he preached the funeral service, an organist who worked at the mortuary came up to him and asked, "I have been playing the organ for funerals for many years and I have never heard a minister preach what you preached, what was it that you were preaching?" He replied, "The Gospel, ma'am, it is called the Gospel" The lady had probably been at hundreds of funerals and had never heard the Gospel!
In another thread, there is a discussion about when, and by whom, the Gospel should be preached. I would argue that a funeral is probably the best time to preach the Gospel. Everyone attending the service is struck to the core of their being by the awfulness of death - including the atheists. I can't believe that you would not care that the Gospel message was preached at your own funeral. Perhaps you have a reliable family and know that they would make appropriate choices or perhaps you interpreted the beginning of the discussion thread as referring to the aesthetics of the funeral and burial - the size of the tombstone, the ornateness of the casket, or the laurels bestowed on the deceased (all these things could be objects of selfishness in the soon-to-be deceased)?

HOT, humid, still conditions greeted the large entry of some 150 golfers young and old competing on Club Captain's Day on Saturday.
The course was in excellent condition once again and a tribute to the hard work of Kevin Rawlins and his team of Steff and Ed. Mention must also be made of the unstinting contribution made by Lyndon Brown, Chairman of Greens.
It was therefore no surprise that there was high scoring. What could not have been predicted were the exceptional scores that came in?
Josh Lewis, playing in the junior section, returned a magnificent 50 points. Who could possibly beat such a tremendous score? It was swashbuckling, senior golfer Gareth Bryant, who did so with a staggering return of 52 points.
Shaun Dyson also had a magnificent card scoring a gross 61 nett 60 to give him 47 stableford points.
The ladies were not to be outshone. Eileen Davies carded a tremendous 48 points only to lose on countback to form golfer Diana Warlow, who also had a haul of 48 points.
The day's golf was followed by an evening quenching the thirst and listening to the music of the talented Dave Williams, singer guitarist.
During the course of the prize giving Lady Captain Pat Evans presented Club Captain Gwyn Scale with a generous donation from the Ladies Section to his Captain's Fund, which will be used to carry out improvements to the course. The support of the Ladies in that regard is greatly appreciated.

Gareth Bryant's extra prize courtesy of Handicap Chairman Dai Humphreys was a withering three shot handicap reduction
Rabbits
AFTER the successful Captain’s Day and the celebrations of Saturday night, Sunday morning saw the Rabbits turn out for their match against Garnant at home. The boys did Milford Haven proud by winning 3.5 to 2.5 against stiff (and possibly less hung-over) competition.
Congratulation are due to Martin Rodgeston of Garnant for his hole in one on the fourth hole.
The next Rabbits game is away at South Pembs on July 27.

Colin Reynolds Points
No changes in the league, Roy John still top with 14 points, Mike Ballantine close second with 12 points and Ken Edwards in third with 10 points.
The biggest applause of the day came when Dick Wooding senior (well in his 80's) playing off a handicap of 28 collected his £1 side bet from Dick Setterfield (in his mid 50's) playing off a handicap of seven.
Ladies Section
ON Tuesday, 15th July, ten ladies played in their weekly tournament in perfect golfing weather. The winner was Liz Durward with 38 points, and the runner up was Eileen Davies, also with 38 points but losing on countback. There were three two's recorded who all received a share of the kitty. Eileen Davies on Hole #8, Cheryl Eva and Denise Kimber both on Hole #16.
On Sunday, 20th July, fourteen ladies played in the Norah Smith Salvers, which is a pair’s competition. Again, it was a glorious golfing day and the course was in very fast condition. The winners were Liz Durward and Barbara Phillips, and the runners-up were Pat Evans and Cheryl Eva.

Health and Beauty Fair in Panama
On June 25, members of the SGI-Panama women's and young women's groups held a health and beauty fair at the SGI-Panama Culture Center Peace Auditorium, located in Panama City. Over 200 people attended and learned ways to enrich their lives through strengthening their health and spirit.
Dr. Yamileth Batista, an SGI-Panama member, lectured on the theme of "Health and a Creative Life" based on SGI President Daisaku Ikeda's writings on health.
Another SGI-Panama member offered advice on skin care and how to have a healthy diet. Participants also enjoyed trying out various exercises accompanied by music, as well as exploring dance therapy--a way of releasing emotions through movement.

Sultan Hagavik are a Polish duo who malarkey around with cassette tape players and dictaphones, using found recordings as well as their own tapes in their crazy bricolage method. 9 Symphonies (BOLT RECORDS BR K001 / NIKLAS RECORDS n/008) is the highly entertaining result, where in just 9 tracks and 37 minutes they speedily exhibit a variety of inventive approaches with mucho good humour and mild surrealism: layers of juxtaposed recordings, odd music fragments, wacky sound effects, slowed-down voices, and many other unidentifiable elements in an atmosphere of carefully contrived insanity. Some pieces are like détourned ambient or easy-listening music, the saccharine melodies transformed into a diabolical blob of garbled filth by these interpolations; on other tracks, the duo arrive at a tongue-in-cheek version of modernist atonal composition, such as on ‘Piano Trio’, where the arbitrary clusters of notes resemble a parodic take on the seriousness of the highbrow conservatoire. The subtitle of this one also tips its sardonic beret in the direction of Górecki, one of the most famous Polish composers, and flippantly remarks that he is “fairly unknown”. Mikolaj Laskowski and Jacek Sotomski allow all the physical characteristics of their chosen medium to work in their favour: distortion and rough sound quality is one element, spontaneity and chance accidents is a second, and a third strong component has to be the way that tapes are manipulated (perhaps by hand) in real time, using controls and buttons to introduce random speed variations and crazed tape wobbles. There have been several composers and improvisers who make free play with these techniques and source materials (just the other night I was wondering whatever became of Stock Hausen & Walkman, those UK zanies who used random found tapes as grenades to throw into their irreverent and chaotic live improvisations), but Sultan Hagavik claim to be the first and only band in Poland “which performs music using tape decks”. Either way, there aren’t many musicians who do it in such a spirited and lively manner, and evidently have a great deal of fun while doing so. That sense of fun may not be immediately obvious from the very sober front cover, but the walrus drawing on the back cover (by Katka Niklas) is a brilliant stroke of incongruity which will connect listeners to John Lennon’s ‘I Am The Walrus’, itself a masterstroke of tape juxtapostions, editing, and happy accidents in the studio, hence a perfect precedent for this album. From 28 November 2012, this is the first in a series of records called “Kikazaru Pleasures”.
Phonos ek Mechanes are a trio of Polish composers, all of them graduates from various music academies, experimenting with computer generated music. On C+- (BOLT RECORDS BR 1016 / NIKLAS RECORDS n/010) they play their instruments – piano, electric guitar and violin that are often themselves prepared or retuned to a microtonal tuning – and feed the signals directly into computer processors. We never hear a single second of “natural” music from the source instruments, and these performances are exercises in computer signal manipulation, using devices to mangle and transform the sounds in real time. The trio of Cezary Duchnowski, Pawel Hendrich and Slawomir Kupczak all have an interest in electro-acoustic composition and advanced computer composition, and are making manifest their faith in the power of the machine with as much fervour as the Italian Futurists – except where the Italians fell on their knees before the motor car and the airplane, our Polish friends worship the pre-determined actions of the microprocessor. Well, it’s not uncommon now for improvising groups to experiment with this methodology, and to my mind one of the best (and most radical) performers to get exciting results with real-time manipulation in a live situation was the great Kaffe Matthews, who produced some remarkable documents of her live sampling work in the late 1990s. More recently, there’s Han-Earl Park and his “machine musician” io o.o.1. beta++, a most remarkable automaton capable of adding its computerised contributions to a live collaboration. Our three Polish friends are probably interacting as gamely as any live improvising combo, but I think for the most part this record is about the sound they make – often a very strange and fluid melange of highly unusual sounds, which resemble neither the instruments they were sourced from nor any form of electronic music you or I would recognise. In short it’s more like electro-acoustic compositions produced in real time – and in spite of Duchnowski’s avowed support of improvised music and his frequent collaborations with jazz players, it lacks some of the sizzle and snap you normally get from live music, emerging as rather gloomy and turgid mixed-frequency droning. Then again, the threesome do manage to get very agitated on ‘Pianolenie’, which is like hearing Cecil Taylor and Max Roach being force-fed through a gated reverb device with a plastic dragon roaring and snorting in the background. It would also be a mistake to dismiss anything involving Slawomir Kupczak, whose Report CD for this label won resounding cheers in this house. The other odd thing, given that the group name simply means “sound of the machine” and how determined they are to turn the computer into an instrument and vice-versa, is how non-mechanical it all sounds. Most music played by sequencers has the simple repetition of a sewing machine, but there’s none of that on offer, nor the sort of over-processed thrice-filtered bilge that emerges from most contemporary laptop music. Instead, the music is quite unpredictable and has a living, breathing presence, with very “glorpy” and organic notes of great bendiness, shiny fluidity, and shapes as tactile as coloured dough. If this is a battle between the man and the machine, then the humans are winning. From 28 November 2012.

A buckskin Kiko buck consigned by John Smith from Petersburg, Virginia, was the top performing buck in the 2008 Western Maryland Pasture-Based Meat Goat Performance Test. Kendall "James" and Dana Barnes from Kentucky had the top consignment of bucks. All four of their bucks were in the top 20. The International Kiko Goat Association presented an award to Merritt Burke from Delaware for having a buck in the top 3 of the test.
Similar to the Forage-based buck test at Oklahoma State University, gold, silver, and bronze standards of performance were established for the bucks on test. To be considered a gold level goat, bucks must not have been dewormed or had a FAMACHA© score higher than 2. Their high and average fecal egg counts must not have been over 1,000 epg. They must have gained at least 0.20 lbs. per day while on test from June 20 until September 29.
To be considered a silver level goat, a buck may have been dewormed one time, but his FAMACHA© score must not have exceeded 3. High and average egg counts must not have exceeded 1,500 epg. Bucks must have gained at least 0.15 lbs. per day. To meet the bronze standard for performance, a buck may have been dewormed twice, but his FAMACHA© score must not have exceeded 3. High and average fecal egg counts must not have exceeded 2,000 eggs per gram. Bucks must have gained at least 0.13 lbs. per day (the test average).
Four bucks met the GOLD standard for performance: a Kiko buck consigned by John Smith (VA), a 75% Kiko buck consigned by Merritt Burke (DE), a Kiko buck consigned by Kendell Barnes (KY), and a 92% Kiko buck consigned by Don Smith (VA). Four bucks met the SILVER standard for performance: a 75% Kiko buck onsigned by Don Smith, a Kiko buck consigned by Jeanne Dietz-Band (MD), a Kiko cross buck consigned by Robie Robinson (VA), and a Kiko buck consigned by Kendell Barnes. Two bucks met the BRONZE standard for performance: a Kiko cross buck consigned by Robie Robinson and a Kiko buck consigned by Warren Barnes (MO).
Eighty-two (82) goats were nominated for the 2008 test. Nominations were received from 21 breeders from 11 states: Delaware, Illinois, Kansas, Kentucky, Maryland, Mississippi, Missouri, Oklahoma, Pennsylvania, and Virginia. Sixty-two (62) goats were accepted for testing. Fifty-seven (57) finished the test. Three died and 2 goats were eliminated because they failed to adapt to the pasture diet.
For the 100-day duration of the test, average daily gain ranged from -0.09 to 0.240 lbs. per day and averaged 0.124 for the 57 goats that finished the test. The average goat gained 13 lbs. while on test, while the best performing goats gained 24 lbs. while on test. ADG was below last year's performance of 0.253 lbs. per day. The poorer performance was attributed to increased parasite problems and rutting behavior. An mid-summer outbreak of soremouth also likely impacted gains.
Last year, few goats required deworming and individual FAMACHA© scores never exceeded 3. This year, several goats required multiple anthelmintic treatments. Each goat was dewormed an average of one time, not including the initial double-deworming. Larvae cultures showed the parasite infection to be almost all Haemonchus contortus.
Sale and Field Day
The 1st Western Maryland Performance-Tested Buck and Invitational Doe Sale and Field Day was held on October 4, 2008. Five of the top-performing bucks were sold. Several bucks failed to receive the minimum bid. 19 does were sold. Several does failed to receive the minimum bid. Most of the does were half-sibs to the bucks on test. It may take several years to build demand for performance tested meat goats, especially pasture-reared ones.
A field day was held in conjunction with the sale. Dr. Dan Waldron from Texas A&M University was the featured speaker. Dr. Waldron discussed different aspects of performance testing goats.
Performance Testing Program
The Western Maryland Pasture-Based Meat Goat Performance Test was initiated in 2006 at the University of Maryland’s Western Maryland Research & Education Center in Keedysville, MD. The purpose of the test is to evaluate the performance of meat goats consuming a pasture-only diet, with natural exposure to internal parasites, primarily Haemonchus contortus (the barber pole worm).
Upon arrival to the test site, the goats stand in a foot bath containing zinc sulfate. Weights, FAMACHA© and body condition scores are determined. A fecal sample is collected. Each goat is dewormed with moxidectin and levamisole. A coccidiostat is put in the water for the first three days of the test.
The goats are managed as a single group on pasture from early June until early October. They are rotationally grazed among five 2-acre paddocks composed of orchardgrass, MaxQ™ tall fescue, chicory, and pearl millet. They always have access to a central laneway containing port-a-hut shelters, a shade structure, water, minerals, and a handling system. The perimeter fencing is 6-strand, high-tensile, electric. The goats are checked one to two times per day.
The goats are handled every two weeks to determine body weights, FAMACHA© scores, and body condition scores. Low-stress livestock handling techniques are used. Goats with FAMACHA© scores of 4 or 5 are dewormed with either moxidectin or levamisole. Goats with FAMACHA© scores of 3 are sometimes dewormed, depending upon other factors.
Fecal samples are collected every 2 weeks to determine individual fecal egg counts. Fecal egg counts are determined by Dr. Dahlia Jackson's lab at Delaware State University. Pooled fecal samples are analyzed to determine parasite types. Larval development assays are done by Dr. Ray Kaplan's lab at the University of Georgia.
Near the end of the test, the goats are scanned to determine 12th rib backfat thickness and rib eye area. Jim Pritchard from West Virginia University does the ultrasound scanning. Scrotal measurements are taken and the goats are evaluated for structural correctness and reproductive soundness.
The goat test committee includes Susan Schoenian1, Jeff Semler1, Willie Lantz1, David Gordon1, Jeanne Dietz-Band1, Mary Beth Bennett2, and Dr. Dahlia Jackson3. Dr. Kevin Pelzer4 serves as the consulting veterinarian.
2009 testing program
The 2009 test will be conducted in a similar manner as the 2008 test. The tentative dates are June 6-October 3, 2009. A field day and performance-tested buck and invitational doe sale will be held on Saturday, October 3, 2009, at the Washington County Agricultural Education Center near Boonsboro, MD.
Eligible goats may be of any breed or breed cross. Registration papers are not required. For the 2009 test, goats must be born between December 15, 2008, and March 20, 2009. They must weigh between 35 and 70 lbs. at the start of the test. They are required to be vaccinated twice for overeating disease and tetanus. The nomination period is April 1 - May 15. There is a non-refundable nomination fee, as well as a testing fee. The total cost for testing a goat will be $85.
Breeders may consign up to 5 goats to the test. Preference will be given to previous consigners and Maryland residents. A slaughter component will be added in 2009. Consigners may nominate 2 goats for this portion of the test. Carcasses will be deboned to determine lean meat yield.

Return to Maryland Small Ruminant Page.This year, there is a widespread implementation of the Common Core Standards in schools.
LOUISVILLE — Standing in her classroom surrounded by place-value boards and colorful chips, Kathy Young looks over the desks of her fifth-graders and reminds them how to write multi-digit whole numbers using the standard form, word form and expanded form.
STORY: Ky. schools look to Singapore for math help
EDITORIAL: Myths fuel attacks on Common Core."
Since 2010, 45 states and the District of Columbia have agreed to adopt the Common Core Standards and have agreed to test students on them by 2014-15, but implementation has been slow — until now.
This fall, 21 states will fully implement the standards in reading and math across all grade levels, joining seven other states and the District of Columbia already using them in classrooms. Seventeen other states will implement the new standards over the next few years. Four states — Alaska, Nebraska, Texas and Virginia have not adopted the standards — and Minnesota has adopted them for English only.
"This school year marks the first time there is a large-scale, widespread implementation of the Common Core Standards across the country," said Michael Cohen, president of Achieve, a bipartisan, non-profit organization founded by governors and the nation's business leaders. "Some states have taken longer than others, and that's OK. This is not a race. This is a way to improve education."
The large-scale implementation comes as politicians in some states have tried to halt it over cost issues and uncertainty over whether the new standards are what's best for their state.
In Indiana this year, kindergarten and first-grade teachers were teaching the standards when state lawmakers agreed to pause overall implementation of the standards pending a legislative review. Similar bills aimed at stopping the standards in Alabama, Kansas, Missouri and South Carolina failed this past year. More bills are likely to be introduced in 2014.
Some conservative groups and other opponents of the new academic standards see the Common Core as an attempt by the federal government to co-opt education.
"This comes across as another large-scale centralized program to try and improve education, and it comes at the expense of parents, taxpayers and educators who are trying to have a voice as to what is taught in their schools," said Lindsey Burke, an education fellow at the Heritage Foundation, a conservative think tank in Washington. "The last thing we need are standards being set in Washington at the expense of state and local control of education."
Over the past few years, federal lawmakers have given $4.35 billion in Race to the Top grant money as an incentive to states that adopt the standards, and they have made Common Core adoption a significant factor in obtaining a waiver from the requirements of No Child Left Behind.
Other opposition comes from educators and researchers who say the standards are not legitimate.
"These standards are inferior to what we need in this country — they are not rigorous, they are not internationally comparable and they are not research-based," said Sandra Stotsky, a professor at the University of Arkansas who served on the Common Core Validation Committee and was one of four committee members who did not sign off on the standards.
Another issue at hand is testing. Supporters hope assessments tied to the new standards will boost achievement on standardized tests and prove American students can compete with their global counterparts.
Testing expert Robert Schaffer with the National Center for Fair and Open Testing said the initial hype with Common Core was that it would result in a new breed of tests that get beyond "multiple-choice bubble."
"The reality is the tests being developed are the same as they have been in the past," he said.
Only two states — Kentucky and New York — have tested on the new standards and the initial results were grim. In both states, fewer than a third of students in grades three through eight scored proficient in math and reading on the new tests.
"It's true that the number of students who scored proficient on our new state assessments did go down, but that isn't because they are not making progress — it is because we are measuring them against higher standards," said Kentucky Education Commissioner Terry Holliday, a supporter of the Common Core who is president-elect of the Council of Chief State School Officers.
"It would certainly be more enjoyable for me to keep the tests the way they were and see more students receive higher scores, but it would also be wrong," he said. "We do our students no favors when we tell them they are ready to succeed in the world when they are not."
Cohen says the results will improve.
"As teachers become increasingly skilled at implementing the standards in their classrooms, our students will do better on the tests and be better prepared for their future," he said.

A new IMF paper on New Zealand's financial system says while the country's four major banks – ANZ, ASB, BNZ and Westpac – have significant high-quality capital, shocks to residential mortgages and corporate lending would put them under pressure.
The working paper includes stress tests – calibrated on the Irish crisis experience – which show New Zealand's four big banks could largely sustain stand-alone shocks to either residential mortgages or corporate lending.
"However, sizable combined shocks to both mortgages and corporate lending would have more pressure on the banks' capital.
"For example, a hard landing in China, and thus Australia, would consequently reduce demand for New Zealand exports, worsen terms of trade and could trigger a sudden decline in house prices.
"This could in turn weaken consumer demand and growth, and negatively affect banks' balance sheets."
The paper says the negative impact of this on the wider economy could be substantial.
While New Zealand's banking regulations are more conservative than in many countries, the vulnerability of the sector should be continually assessed to minimise the risk that banks pose to the economy.
However, it says supervision of the sector will only do so much, and higher minimum capital requirements should be considered.
"Given their size, they are perceived as too big to fail and pose a potential fiscal risk.
"More robust capital levels for systematically important domestic banks would be beneficial, particularly in times of market uncertainty and given their large wholesale funding needs."
Negative affects
The paper warns that any "distress" in one of the four banks could have significant negative affects on the entire financial system, and in turn New Zealand's economy as a whole.
It says banks' exposure to highly indebted households and to the agriculture sector is a key vulnerability.
"Household debt remains high at over 140% of disposable income, and a rise in mortgage rates together with an increase in unemployment could lead to an increase in non-performing loans.
"A large fall in commodity prices would impair the quality of agricultural loans, but the capital requirements for these loans have been strengthened since mid-2011."
Despite the warnings, the working paper says overall, New Zealand's four major banks are in good health.
"The soundness of the New Zealand banking sector was crucial to the resilience of the economy during the global financial crisis.
"Bank profits are strong and non-performing loans are less than 2% of total loans, low by advanced country standards."
It says the banks have high-quality capital well above the regulatory requirements.

There is no risk to NZ banks, because there ARE no NZ banks.
There are several NZ fully owned banks. I guess what you really mean, Anonymous, is that there is no NZ-owned bank among the top four.
Fractional reserve banking combined with a FIAT currency is a flawed system requiring exponential new loans to be made to cover the previous loans interest.

Post New comment or questionGRAND BLANC, MI – A Grand Blanc resident has a big idea for Grand Blanc Parks and Recreation and the $600,000 in a past millage money that the organization has set aside.
Kevin Groves, who also serves as the Downtown Development Authority chairman, announced this month that he would like to see the Parks and Recreation department have a permanent home – whether it means purchasing the current building it's located in, or building a new one next to it – a farmers market building and an outdoor ice rink.
Groves said he's a big supporter of parks and recreation and would like to see the money used for something good in the city, leveraged with funds from other sources, such as the DDA and grants that may be available.
"The whole community would enjoy an ice rink. The whole community would enjoy the farmers market. The whole community already enjoys parks and rec," Groves said.
Groves said the DDA's development plan calls for a downtown pavilion and ice rink, and although the DDA does not have the funding now, he said that the DDA would participate in such a project later.
"I'm not trying to tell anybody what to do, I'm asking people to consider there are some things we can do," Groves said. "There might be somebody else out there with a better idea than I got, and I'm willing to listen."
Groves announced his idea at both this month's DDA and city council meetings. His next step is to sell the idea to the parks and recreation commission on Thursday, Feb. 20. The commission meets at 5:30 p.m. Thursday at the parks and rec administration office.
Kae Eidson, Grand Blanc Parks and Recreation executive director, said the parks and recreation commission hasn't discussed the plan yet and Groves' proposal will be provided to the members. She said Groves did approach her last week with his idea.
"I think he has some pretty interesting ideas and we're interested in getting into a permanent home. I think there are some real positive things that can come out of the idea," Eidson said.
Another farmers market
At a joint Grand Blanc city and township meeting in August, officials entertained the idea of a year-round building that would be shared by Parks and Recreation and the Grand Blanc farmers market – which currently consists of vendor booths outside, along Grand Boulevard.
The building idea stemmed from concerns over the $28,475 a year in rent that Parks and Recreation spends for its offices on Grand Blanc Road. The rent is shared by the city and township.
The idea of a year-round farmers market would make it the third planned for Genesee County. The Flint Farmers Market is expected to move from its current location into a building in downtown Flint this summer. Not long after that move was announced, the Davison Farmers Market LLC announced its plans to begin construction of a new year-round market on Court Street, just east of Irish Road.
Background on the funding.
Eidson said the millage fund has $601,245 left in it.
At last week's city council meeting, City Attorney Walter Griffin said the $601,245 is parks and recreation commission's money to be used for acquiring, developing, operating and maintaining parks and recreation. However, he said there is an agreement between the parks and recreation commission – which is made up of both city and township residents – and the city that the funds would be used within the city.
Although the funding belongs to parks and recreation and would not need city council approval on how it's spent, Eidson said the money has always been spent at the discretion of the city council.
As far as if the money could be used to build a new building, Griffin said it could be debated on both sides if "developing" in the millage language includes "building."

I asked this boy, 'what should
you do when you feel sick?'
The most common response is usually 'tell Mummy' or 'get a doctor,' 'go to the hospital,' etc.
This child's response was, 'get a bucket and a towel.'
A very practical child indeed!
The above example is a child's perfectly reasonable response to my question. He was using
social language in a way that, though perhaps not expected, was an appropriate interpretation
of my question about what to do when sick.
The boy's response is a good example of social
language. Pragmatics involves the rules used for social language. That is, the essential language skills and social knowledge that
enable us to understand a conversation partner's intended meaning, and to respond in an
appropriate manner.
Language is mostly a social instrument and consists of a set of symbols and rules. Those symbols and rules are organised and arrayed by pragmatic language.
Some of the organising principles of pragmatic language include the rule of turn taking, knowing
how to open a conversation, and how to end it.
Also, being able to establish and maintain a topic
that is of interest to a conversational partner (the person you talk to) is an important skill.
Written below is an example of an interaction I recently had with a 10-year-old student with
Asperger's syndrome,
who has poor pragmatic language skills.
Clinician: (referring to a story book) 'Look at this girl here. Why do you think she's
annoyed and what tells us she's annoyed?'
Student: 'She's angry like princess Leia when she got stuck in the Death Star. Luke rescued her
and then they got away.'
Clinician: 'Oh Star Wars, yes? We can maybe talk about Star Wars later but for now let's concentrate on this book, and this girl. Look carefully at her face.'
Student looks closely at the picture, frowns, but says nothing.
Clinician: (prompts) 'Is the look on the girl's face an unhappy expres..?'
Student: (Interrupting) 'I don't want to talk about this book.' 'Did you know that Han Solo is my favourite?'
As we can see from the above example the student had difficulty responding to my
requests and topic of conversation.
The student couldn't stay on task and had poor understanding of
conversational rules such as turn taking.
He was interested only in talking about his favorite subject: Star Wars.
A child with pragmatic impairment has a poor grasp of social skills, so has problems
understanding other people's communication needs. In other words, they have little interest in other peoples' topics of discussion, and are focused on their own interests and will talk about them at length.
To other children or adults,
a child with pragmatic impairment may come across as being selfish and self-centred. But they're not. They simply have difficulty understanding social rules and conventions and so unintentionally
'step on peoples toes.'
An advanced pragmatic language area that we can expect older school-age
children with typically developing language to be aware of, if perhaps not yet quite mastered is

Masahiro Tanaka will make his Fenway Park debut, getting his first taste of the bitter rivalry on Tuesday night when he lines up against lefty Jon Lester.
Tanaka, 25, hasn't lost a game since 2012, dating back to a 24-0 season in Japan last year and a 2-0 start to his major league career this spring. He hasn't just been good -- he's been dominant. He's struck out 28 batters to just two walks in 22 innings, leading the American League in strikeout/walk ratio. Left-handed batters are hitting .133 with a .352 OPS off him.
With a splitter that's at least worthy of being in the same sentence as Koji Uehara's, Tanaka brings an arsenal of pitches to his first start in Boston.
The Red Sox spoke highly of him during the negotiation process last offseason but were never willing to reach the $155 million salary over seven seasons, in addition to the $20 million posting fee, that the Yankees offered.
"Looking forward to seeing him pitch," said Boston manager John Farrell. "I think anyone who is a fan of the game is going to look at a highly touted guy coming to the major leagues here. have only seen highlights or video prior to him signing with New York. We know that he’s got a well above average split-finger fastball. Competitive, strong and looking forward to seeing him on the field and across the field from him.”
Tanaka's start hasn't been unlike many other Japanese pitching sensations who make the transition. Daisuke Matsuzaka and Yu Darvish each made strong first impressions in the majors.
"I don’t think it’s uncharacteristic," Farrell said. "You see a number of guys with similar command and similar type of stuff. What’s probably been as impressive as anything, and again, this is through three starts, pretty quick transition into the major leagues here.”
The Red Sox at least have the advantage of being able to watch three game's worth of video.
"He's going to be like every other pitcher," said first baseman Mike Napoli. "We're going to watch video on him, get a scouting report, everyone's going to have a plan when we go up there. He's not going to be any different. Only thing that's different is we've never faced him before. So go up there, have a good approach and do the best we can."
While most eyes will be on Tanaka, don't forget the center fielder playing behind him.
Jacoby Ellsbury makes his return to Fenway Park for the first time since hoisting the World Series trophy on the infield grass last October. The longtime Red Sox outfielder could be in for an overwhelming amount of boos, though there are sure to be some who didn't forget his contributions.
"I think that’s the reason I love this rivalry," Ellsbury said earlier this month. , left it out there and I know the time I was there, they respected that, they liked the way I played, the way I went about my business. We’ll see what happens."Bhanwari Devi is in a fix. Kya karein? Bechari Mallika, and her movie director KC Bokadia, have been receiving death threats warning them not to go ahead with the movie.
Sherawat confirmed the story saying, “I have received threats. There was a call that my brother received, saying ‘tell your sister to stay away from this topic and from the film.’ I think these kinds of threats will be issued.” Filmmaker Bokadia too said, “I have also received lot of threats. I know my duty as a filmmaker. Though I am inspired by the Bhanwari Devi case, I have presented it in my own style. I think it will be a clean and good film. We have done the film in our way.”
Not many know that the murder of the 36-year-old nurse Bhanwari Devi had been a burning issue as reports had alleged that the murder had been planned and executed by a politician from Rajasthan. In today’s time when any publicity is good publicity, we hope Mallika’s recent threat calls allegations are genuine; if not, then it’s certainly a very dirty publicity stunt. Right Mallika?
Age of Worms: The Return
Zerric Splintershield
A valiant dwarf warrior
Description:
Bio:
Zerric is a Dwarf myrmidon who is played by Brett Thompson. Zerric was almost killed by a member of the Ebon Triad at Blackwall Keep. Zerric has obtained his ancestral weapon: a dwarven warpike named Darkfane, once wielded by his great-grandfather Kelmaren.
Zerric was raised in the Splintershield stronghold. As part of the original bloodline, Zerric (like his Cousin Bors Splintershield) is amoung the highest blood of the hold, though he does not care to make this fact known. Because his father Vaurduk Splintershield is steward of the hold, Zerric and his brother recieved military training and defend the hold. His only sister is one of the ringmaidens of the court, and so the two are not very close. Zerric excelled as a soldier, even going so far as to become a member of the myrmidon force of the stronghold. After the devastation of Cauldron, Zerric and his family recieved news that Zenith Splintershield was dead, a relative that tried to pick up the mantle of Kelmaren Splintershield. Confident in his training, Zerric set out from the hold with the purpose of honing his tactics, and retrieving the lost artifacts of the hold: the mighty suit of armor and weapon wielded by Kelmaren, known as the Sentinel’s Raiment.
When he heard news from his cousin Bors, Zerric set out for the small town of Diamond Lake in order to retrieve the ancestral weapon posessed by Balabar Smenk. After working as an enforcer for Smenk, he came into possession of the weapon when Smenk was murdered. After his traumatic experience of almost dying, Zerric feels honor bound to assist those who saved his life. He has a growing fondness for all the group: Doran Stout is a mighty wizard, with the most impressive skill with a quarterstaff he has ever seen. Vadir di’Cazzeo has earned his respect for the stealth he employs (something Zerric is almost incapable of) as well as his impressive throwing ability. He does not understand the warlock’s power, nor does he care to: it has saved him all too many times in battle. Ivagmar, one who a dwarf would normally not associate with, has shown his prowess in versitility: there is no finer archer, and he is skilled with melee combat as well. Lastly, his cousin Bors Splintershield is more like a brother to him than a cousin. Though he will always make the distinction to a human, he feels a strong comradery with Bors. His more religious cousin seems to always have the right retort, and is as hardy as any in battle. The priest has illicited his respect since long before he was called to Diamond Lake. Zerric’s uncle (Bors’ Father) long ago instilled a respect for men of the cloth.
During his stay in Liberty, Zerric has had a great many changes in his life. As he first entered the city, he did not like the idea of staying there. Zerric is opposed to the idea of being unarmed and unarmored, and this puts him at a great unease. He has faced many perils in Liberty, the worst of which was facing aganist Zyrxog. Since his encounter with the Illithid, Zerric has been far more cautious, as well as being more faithful since visiting his god’s halls. Whereas he once saw The Age of Worms to be the affairs of upworlders, the return from the grave left him with newfound purpose: to end the threat of the impending age of worms. With the help of the church, and thier new ally Elligos, he feels certain they are destined to accomplish such a goal.
During the games Zerric has gained even more respect for his comrades. He is unsure about the new addition to thier group, Byron, however he does realize what a valuable asset he has been thus far. During the games he was fearful of breaking rules as they were under scrutiny, but since having used the Sepris’ influence (and seeing its effectiveness), he is much more lax about following rules so closely. He has grown more and more impatient with the plots against them, and now seeks to kill both Theldrick and Loris Raknian. Now that The Diamond Band are the champions of the city’s games, he hopes they will have earned enough respect to give more weight to thier words. With the champion’s belt within his grasp, he is one step closer to completing his ancestral collection, and furthur increasing his effectiveness against his enemies.
After having returned to Diamond Lake, Zerric has begun to take great sympathy for the plight of these upworlders. Seemingly, everywhere he and his friends go there is trouble following. He has grown a deeper concern for the wizards, as they are now targets for the evil cult. Because of this, Zerric is willing to go to nearly any lengths to protect Doran, Allustan, and Marzena (who he assumes is still alive, if in great danger). Zerric’s quest to retreive his family heirlooms now extends furthur than the underdark: the new bastion of evil appears to have come to the surface.
After having retrieved a section of the Rod of seven parts, Zerric helped to bring the rod to Manzorian. Afterwards, Zerric helped to find the Spire of Long Shadows. There he and the diamond band cleansed the temple, where Zerric apprehended a spellweaver lich for his friends to destroy. In doing so, the temple collapsed in on itself, killing the millions of worms within. Once they learned the secrets within (including a need to find Dragotha), they set off for the north, where they learned of Alhaster.
In Alhaster, the Diamond Band investigated the whereabouts of Dragotha, and found results at a dinner party with Prince Zeech. They met a young elven woman who told them of an island called Tilagos where many lost artifacts had been hidden away. There they could find the secret of Dragotha’s phylactery, and use it to destroy the ancient dracolich. However, when they found out that others were on the trail, the group came together to form a plan. When they all arrived at the island, they were met with a group of orcs, which had to be fought off. Unfortunately, they were no match for the might of the heroes, and Zerric downed many of those who came to stop the group. Afterwards, Zerric and the others went through a portal to the true island, on another plane.
The island they arrived at was harsh, Zerric personally is not prepared for the sort of terrain, but with his allies’ help, he was ready to go. As they first arrived they came upon four Wild Watchers, each of whom had a trial for them. These four trials would test their worthiness for the prize within the library. They decided to go into the forest, where they faced a shrieking tree, and leveled it into a horrid stump. As they were on thier way out, they were attacked by giant displacer beasts, as well as some woodland creatures similar to True Elves. When they finally got out, they rested, and prepared to face a trial to the south.
The creature to the south was a titanic creature, whose belt was the second task. Unfortunately, he was not willing to part, and the group felt it was either wrong or too dangerous to simply kill him for it, based on his claim of serving Terak. Thus, they decided to go look for the other two tasks, and see if it wass possible to finish them. After locating the Roc king (who had been slain by Theldrick), they decided to go to the south, where they found a nightmarish creature. The beast was quite wiley, but between Zerric keeping the creature at bay, and the spellcaster’s impressive performance, he was slain. So the group decided to complete the third task of retrieving a feather from the Roc King, whom they ressurected, and stole the feather from (but without harming). After setting off to the throne of the Titan Krathanos, they had one purpose: Kill Theldrick in order to free up time in the library. When they arrived however, the powerful giant was gone from his hold, and only the voice of Theldrick rang out in the large room.Findings:

COLLEGE STATION, Texas - Breaking Records. It has been the running theme of the season and the University of Houston continued the journey to the top as both teams placed sixth at the Texas A&M Aggie Invitational Saturday.
Freshman Brian Barraza broke the school record in the men's 3000m run with a winning time of 8:16.84. The previous record of 8:19.60 was set last season at the Conference USA Championship by Yonas Tesfai.
Senior Ngozi Onwumere finished third in the women's 200m dash with an indoor personal best time of 23.77. Her time is the top time on the time this season and she jumps to the 21st fastest time in the nation. Fellow senior Brittany Wallace also recorded a personal best time of 23.99 in the 200m for sixth place overall.
Middle distance runners Anthony Coleman and Chris Ibarra recorded the top two times of the season in the men's 800m.

The Cougars continued to improve as 18 other members of the Houston Track and Field teams recorded personal best marks in their respective events.
In the field events, freshman Cameron Burrell recorded the second best jump of the season by a Cougar with a leap of 7.28m (23'-10.75") to claim fourth after only one attempt. Alicia Perkins was the women's top finisher with a team season second best leap of 5.69m (18'-8").

Lovely cd/radio
A bit costly but probably worth it. It's solid, well-crafted, in a beautiful polished wood case. I had a hard time getting good radio reception in my room with three different stereos. When I bought the Tivoli, it was a strong, clear signal before I had even uncoiled the antenna wire.
Literally the only drawback I can find is that the power button is mixed in with all the other small buttons; really tricky trying to find in the dark..Article by @AmySpiro, Israel correspondent
Move over Ben Yehuda Street, there’s a new hotspot in Jerusalem, and it’s Emek Refaim. Of course that’s if hotspot means teeming with yeshiva and seminary students and tourists. The long street is located just South of the center of the city, about a 15 minute walk from downtown. Close to the Inbal Hotel, the King David Hotel and the Dan Boutique Hotel, it's a great place to stop for a meal, walk around and check out the locals.
It’s not hard to see why this street is popular: practically every other store is a restaurant and with some real standouts, you can eat very well in this part of town. Here is what’s on offer – kosher-wise – in the order you’ll spot them if you’re walking down the street from the direction of the center of town.
Big Apple Pizza – Right at the beginning of Emek Refaim’s restaurant row sits this simple pizza joint, with unfortunately more Israeli than New York style pizza, but still a popular option with Anglos and Sabras alike. 19 Emek Refaim.
Burgers Bar – If a New York restaurant offered you chimichurri or a fried egg on your burger you’d probably look at them as if they were crazy, but welcome to Israel! Burgers Bar is an enormously popular chain that churns out reliably tasty burgers, schnitzels and other grilled specialties for reasonable prices. Whatever you get, add the garlic mayo. 20 Emek Refaim
Coffee Mill – If you know coffee, then you’ll want to stop by this place, where instead of the sole option of “Cafe Hafuch” most Israeli joints offer, you can get coffee from Guatemala or Ethiopia as well as flavored varieties from mint to chocolate or butterscotch. 23 Emek Refaim.
Joy Grill – By now Joy is a well established player on the Emek Refaim scene and it’s usually pretty crowded. That’s probably because it manages to keep a wide menu that pleases everyone while still incorporating innovation – like roasted duck breast with caramel or citrus flavored chicken. 24 Emek Refaim.
Waffle Bar – Yes it’s a chain restaurant, but what a tasty one it is. It’s hard to go wrong on this menu, with their delicious laffa toasts or savory crepes. Plus don’t forget the main event – the waffles. Topped with ice cream and chocolate sauce (or about 10 other options) – that can be a meal on its own. 24 Emek Refaim.
RYU – Despite the long tradition of Jews loving Chinese food, it’s not a cuisine that is super popular in Israel, but RYU manages to serve a pan-Asian menu that pleases all. From stir frys to sushi to pad thai – and of course egg rolls – every member of your family should be pleased. 25 Emek Refaim.
Luciana – This dairy Italian restaurant sells a variety of bruschetta, focaccia and salads, plus of course nine types of pizza and a whopping 19 different pasta dishes, as well as fish options. 27 Emek Refaim
Baba Israeli Kitchen – Basically a hummus joint, but with an expanded menu that includes kebabs, chicken wings and steaks. Of course the hummus is the star, and with 16 different varieties, you’re sure to find one that appeals. 31 Emek Refaim.
Masaryk – Yes it’s another Italian restaurant filled with pasta and fish dishes, but Masaryk offers some more exciting dishes than most, like pinenut ravioli or goat cheese and eggplant gnocchi. Plus they have eight different fish dishes if that’s your kind of thing. 31 Emek Refaim.
Caffit – This is as close to permanence as restaurants in this area of town get – and Caffit has been serving up its menu for over 20 years. That includes a kids menu, a breakfast menu and a special Friday menu, in addition to their reliable salads, pastas, fish and sandwiches. 35 Emek Refaim.
Pizza Italia – Serving an untraditional rectangular pie, this little storefront offers exactly what you’d expect – pizza – from standard versions to red pepper or spicy red chili, and it’s sold by weight so you get exactly how much you want. 38 Emek Refaim.
Ben Ami – Half cafe half bakery, you’re better off stopping in at this little restaurant for dessert than lunch. And of course for people watching, another favorite Israeli pastime, and this is the perfect location for it. Emek Refaim 38.
Marvad Haksamim – Like its counterpart on King George Street, Marvad Haksamim serves up hearty Israeli soul food, from the classic kubbe soup to kebabs and hummus that comes with freshly baked flatbread. 42 Emek Refaim.
Holy Bagel – It’s a battle of the bagels, and I’ll pick Holy over Tal any day. Price and quality play a role in that decision, and this is a great place to grab a sandwich on your way to… anything. 42 Emek Refaim.
Shnitsi – I don’t know about you, but I practically lived off this stuff when I was in seminary. The style at Shnitsi is one that has been copied by numerous schnitzel joints in the US these days: Pick schnitzel or grilled chicken, then pick your veggies and dressing to finish off your delectable sandwich. Of course, they sell things like burgers and salads and wings too, but really, just get a sandwich. 42 Emek Refaim.
Aroma – What is there really to say about Aroma? Sandwiches, salads, coffee (with chocolate on the side) – nothing exceptional, except perhaps the warm farmer’s salad – this is always chock full of Americans and Israelis tapping away on their laptops. 43 Emek Refaim.
Pizza Sababa – Hey, it’s another pizza joint! This one is a pretty typical Israeli version, with toppings only a sabra could love…. like corn, eggplant or artichoke. They also have a small selection of pastas and salads. 43 Emek Refaim.
New Deli – Yes, it’s a terrible pun for a name, but if you’re looking for deli, this is the way to do it. Pick from a dozen deli meats and white, whole wheat or rye bread, veggies and sauces and take a huge bite, for just 25 shekel. Plus only an extra 10 for doubling your meat. And why not throw in some fries for another 10? 44 Emek Refaim.
Cafe Cafe – One of the most ubiquitous cafe chains in Israel (neck-and-neck with Aroma), you won’t find a whole lot of innovation on the menu (except maybe their pumpkin coconut soup in the winter) but you’ll still find the salads, pastas and fish done well. 44 Emek Refaim.
La Boca – Hidden on the second floor of a building, La Boca is nevertheless sought out by locals and tourists alike, who are eager to try their nice selection of tapas, or perhaps the chili con carne, chorizo or paella epagna. Don’t miss out on the warm churros. 46 Emek Refaim.
Sushi Bar Rehavia – It’s hard to go to a Jewish event – wedding, bar mitzvah, kiddush – without sushi being served these days, and the same is true about Emek Refaim. So this branch of the Sushi Bar that is actually found in Rehavia (on Aza Street, though there are now two other chains) provides some pretty extensive sushi offerings, plus a long list of meat Asian offerings. 48 Emek Refaim.
Buffalo Steakhouse – This is a steakhouse in the true sense of the word, with six options of its namesake as well as a fairly extensive selection of lamb, chicken and beef. The upscale restaurant doesn’t exactly come cheap, so bring along a solid amount of cash. 54 Emek Refaim.
Hamoshava 54 – Yes, 54 is the address, but it’s also the most expensive item on the menu, making this a great pick for budget eaters. The menu is divided into four sections: foods priced at 10, 20, 40 and 54 shekels. So mix and match anything from home fries to salmon to beef carpaccio or steak. 54 Emek Refaim.
Cafe Hillel – Another ubiquitous cafe chain, Hillel is slightly pricier than most but I have a soft spot for their pasta dishes and foccacia. They have a wide enough menu that just about everyone will find something to enjoy. 54 Emek Refaim.
Tal Bagels – You’re more likely to hear English than Hebrew at this more-than-just-a-bagel store, which offers a variety of breakfast and lunch options, though perhaps a little overpriced than most bagel places. Still a tasty hangout for a homesick New Yorker. 64 Emek Refaim.Last week, James and I took our first real vacation - the only time we've taken a "vacation" and not spent the time visiting family or traveling back & forth for school. It was our 10th anniversary, so we wanted to have a great time; however, since we're in the middle of a Total Money Makeover and are still trying to pay off debt, we had to be careful with our plans.
Here's what we did:
1. Location: We found somewhere we wanted to go that was within a couple of hours. That means that our round trip cost us one tank of gas - not bad for vacation travel.
2. Accommodations: We splurged a bit on a hotel, and it was SO worth the money. It was very clean, our room was spacious and quiet, and the complimentary breakfast was great. (We definitely could have saved money by camping, but camping in the South in August = HOT. Not my idea of a good time.)
3. Activities: A few weeks leading up to our trip, I spent quite a bit of time researching area attractions, restaurants, ticket prices, etc. This enabled us to have a plan of attack, and we ended up pacing ourselves better and saving money with combo tickets.
4. Entertainment: In addition to the attractions we wanted to see, we also planned to go out to one movie. We also brought a couple of our Netflix DVDs to play on the laptop, and we rented two more movies from Blockbuster while we were gone. We also brought our Wii and hooked it up in the hotel; James and I love playing video games together. (I know, we're geeks.)
5. Food: Last but not least, the food. As I mentioned, our hotel had a great breakfast. Our room had a microwave & refrigerator, so we had one additional meal in our room every day. The daily food budget was $30, and by having a quick lunch or dinner in our room, we were able to eat out a couple of times at nicer places.
All in all, we had a great time. We did come in a bit over budget, but the tips I've shared definitely helped keep our costs as low as possible!

My fiancee and I also enjoy finding trips that aren't too far away. We found a book that recognizes all of these little towns around us where we can have day trips, and we turn them into weekend extravaganzas with hotel movies to boot for entertainment. It makes the trip more enjoyable at the end of the weekend when you can come back and not feel ripped of your savings. Thank you for sharing!!
We're doing a few of these this week, although with Hubby in class all day, we don't have extra time to sight see. But watching the food budget while traveling will definitely save money!
It sounds like you really did an amazing job though, it would have been easy to come in way over budget! Thanks for the tips, I appreciate you sharing.
Good idea! Thanks for sharing!
We live in Southern California so there are just a ton of little weekend trips out there for us. My husband and I decided that since our birthdays are both in January, we would treat ourselves to a weekend away every year. We started this year with Coronado, San Diego. Sometimes we forget about the treasures all around us!The Celebrate Israel Festival on May 31 at Pier 94, slated to be the largest gathering to date of Israeli-Americans in New York.

The expected loss per share includes a tax reserve of 12 cents against the benefit of the net operating loss expected in the second quarter. In the first quarter of 2001, ON Semiconductor reported revenues of $361 million and a loss per share of 7 cents, before restructuring charges and other intangibles. The company originally expected its second quarter revenues to be flat or slightly down from the first quarter. In ON's second quarter, the rate of order cancellations has decreased significantly from the first quarter. However, continued high customer inventory levels are pushing out many orders and caused part prices to decline 10% from the first quarter, it said. ON Semiconductor expects third quarter revenues to be down slightly from the second quarter with little change in operating margin. In response to its inventory conditions, the company recently announced accelerated cost reduction measures, including reducing its workforce by 8 to 12%, or about 1,000 positions. Other measures include temporary plant shutdowns with mandatory vacation, salary reductions for U.S. employees, reduced capital expenditures and continued rationalization of manufacturing capacity.The paintings are 2D — but you wouldn't know it.

Coffee and samples from Kresge Court's new menu will be available at the grand opening celebration, according to the DIA's Facebook page.
Annmarie Erickson, the museum's vice president and chief operating officer, told MLive Detroit in February she expected Kresge Court to "look way different" with new furniture, lighting treatments and other amenities.
The plan is to turn the area into a warm, inviting public space that can be accessed by the general public for free during museum hours.
"It will really become what we like to call a cultural living room for the community," Erickson said. "C'mon in; it will be a place where you can have a small business meeting if that fits; you can get a cup of coffee and something to eat; or you can just sit back and relax.
"And it will be like that all time; open during museum hours. We won't close it for anything."
The "new" Kresge Court will still include some museum programs, including the popular Sunday music series.
Funding for the makeover come from variety of sources including a grant from an organization called ArtPlace and money from the DIA's allocation for capital improvements.
"We really want people to feel like it's their space to use," Erickson said.Boxing Forum

Kalib Posted this on the Sherdog forums...
"I was never on any Montreal radio show. If anyone knows what radio show that I allegedly appeared on, or has any recording of it or any evidence of it whatsoever I would love to know about it. So far I've only heard rumors and allegations. I did not throw the fight, the fight was not a protest against the UFC.
I will say again what I've said before; I had the game plan of circling and moving to stay out of exchanges and to work off of my jab because he hits so hard, to avoid the clinch because he was very strong and I'd taken knees and elbows there in my previous fight, and to throw some kicks as the fight wore on.
I threw 35 punches in the first round and I would have thrown a lot more had I landed any of them, but I found him very difficult to hit and he was counter punching whenever I would step in, with one of those counter punches almost dropping me early. Most of my takedowns come out of the clinch and when I tried to switch it up and get position in the clinch to take him down I couldn't do it because he seemed much stronger than me.
In the second round it was more of the same except that he almost knocked me out again early which made me more hesitant to throw punches so I decided to throw some kicks and at about 2 minutes into round two I threw a low right roundhouse kick that hit his shin awkwardly and I broke my foot, which stopped me from throwing anymore kicks, other than a few tentative kicks with my left leg. **That is not an excuse for losing it is simply something that happened and for me to mention it I think is quite reasonable.
I found myself in a fight where I couldn't stand with the guy, he was awkward and he hit hard having almost knocked me out three times in the fight, I couldn't take him down and work my ground game (I got him down only once and just managed to land a few shots because he got up so fast), and so I felt like I could either keep moving or get knocked out. Then late in the third he started to mock me out of frustration, but really at that point, I was just a solidly beaten fighter who was trying not to get knocked out, and had fallen into a pattern that I couldn't get out of. It was the worst athletic performance of my life.
Afterword his cornerman was swearing at me and calling me names, I responded to him by calling him names and telling him that he should get in there and fight then, meaning fight in the UFC, not fight me. He apologized to me afterword I suppose realizing that he was out of line, and so did Nate and I know that they were both acting out of frustration and so I forgave them and apologized in return for losing my temper. I think it's rediculous that he be made into some kind of hero for mocking a guy that he just beat the crap out of, and I felt forced into retreating because he had such a good offense. I didn't choose to do it as some kind of protest. I did try to win that fight and I did show up to fight, I don't care what Dana White says, I just wasn't good enough on that day to do it. I have no excuses for losing the fight.
If you want a copy of my medical records the guys at Sherdog can contact me, or Primo at ATT and you'll be provided with that. I can't speak for anyone else, but I have never said that the UFC does not cover a fighters medical expenses, I'm dealing with their medical claims department right now regarding my broken foot and other injuries sustained at UFC 83, and up until this point they have honored their obligations.
I have as much right to discuss what fighters are paid as anyone else and I know a lot about the subject having fought for the organization in some capacity seven times. Believe me, you're paid if you win and tossed aside like garbage if you lose. Until these guys learn to market themselves the payouts are going to remain pathetic compared to boxing and the UFC's little traveling circus will roam from town to town with the billionaires raking in the cash while the fighters split up about five percent of the take between them.
What prompted me to discuss it were comments about it being wise to get knocked out as opposed to moving out of the way, apparently from brain injury advocates who've taken their own advice. I'm not retiring and I've already been offered more than I ever made at the UFC, which was $5,000 and $5000, plus $30000 fight of the night (which they gave me because I had no heart), plus an additional $25000 (because I don't belong in the UFC presumably). That's $65,000 you clever little monkeys, but remember that if I'd lost I would have walked away with a sweet $5000 and a kick in the ass, because they only pay the winners. The only problem with that is, somebody loses every time.

yeah from watching Quarry's other fights the guy can punch, but Kalib had 2 have had a game plan for fighting someone with Nates heavy hands.
i'm no fight expert but if Kalib wants 2 keep on fighting an pulling off wins i think he should really look into changing fight camps, ATT is good but it don't seem 2 b helping him win lately.

yeah he seems real stiff when he fights, im sure the fused disks in his back an neck may have somethin 2 do with it (quite sure thats the kinda surgery he had).
its awesome he still has the heart 2 fight after that, but still think it'd b Dangerous 2 throw him in there with Silva if Quarry keeps pullin off Wins.

The Cruise
Terminal of Cartagena is located in the exterior part of the Marina, next
to the new building of the Yacht Club, a suitable place due to its
proximity to the city center, cultural, leisure and commercial area
of the quay.
The terminal has a bus stop, taxi rank, information points, and
all the necessary services so that tourists have a pleasant arrival
to the city, as well as being connected with the Alfonso XII Quay
by means of pedestrian and vehicle accesses, through the Marina commercial
area.

in Cruise Port:
An ancient city with a name to match - it was founded more than
2,200 years ago by Carthaginian leader Hasdrubal - Cartagena is now
one of Spain's busiest commercial centers. Step ashore here, though,
and you are immediately aware of its rich history. In fact, you see
it even as you cruise towards the harbor as this is flanked by towering
fortresses. Then, in the center of the old town, you will find the
original Carthaginian castle and sections of the old city walls.
Among its numerous Roman remains stands out the recently restored Roman theatre of Carthago Nova that is one of the landmarks of the city.
But Cartagena is
also a city which moves with the times hence the new harbor front.
The National Museum of Maritime
Archeology: Amphorae, lead ingots, anchors, even a life-size
model of a Roman merchant ship. This is only part of what is contained
in this museum, whose exhibits are full of objects recovered on underwater
archaeological digs. The items on display take us on a journey through
the history of sea trade and traffic, as well as maritime history,
with special emphasis on the Phoenician and Roman eras. Also worthy
of note is the collection of seven scale models of ancient vessels,
and even an exact replica of a galley.

My Reasons for Reporting This(I have such a bad sense of direction that often the only way I get un-lost is to go the opposite way from what I believe must be the right direction! It is a strange kind of double-think, like something from Alice Through the Looking-Glass.)
This is a comical affliction when it comes to running! I had a lovely long run this morning, it really was good (low humidity, strong and steady legs, and I think I may have finally shaken off my stress-fracture-related muscle problems, the sports massage stuff has properly taken effect), and yet it also must be said that one of the other best things about this run was that I did not actually get lost until about mile 8 of 9.3. Mercifully late in the game!
I know Central Park reasonably well, I run there often, I looked at our little map (reproduced below, with some rather Gatoradish blots in the middle), and yet as soon as I wasn't running with anyone else I went completely astray. I had left the bridle path, I was trying to avoid the 10K race taking place on the main road, and I ran on a little path alongside the road in a direction that I was convinced was taking me towards the upper loop--it was with an extremely familiar sinking feeling that I suddenly realized I was coming upon Engineer's Gate (East 90th St.) from the north, when I could have sworn I was still running north up the west side....
However there are a number of positive things about this too.
1. At team meetings, it makes me feel like a character in one of Enid Blyton's Mallory Towers stories, where all girls have one or two distinctive traits that are alluded to as shorthand instead of character development. My character as far as the running class goes is that I am fast and once I start I will go forever without stopping--only perhaps not in the right direction...
2. More practically, I now have a lovely device that directly counters the ill effects of this problem! It's not GPS technology, you still can't get a Jetsonesque wrist unit that's as good as what you might have in a car, also it would be embarrassing if it spoke to you out loud on the street and GPS is fallible in the park in any case (this morning I was making a fervent mental note that if I ever have to get a car & start driving--i.e. let's say I go and teach at UCLA or somewhere like that--I will be damned to the expense and will definitely get the best GPS device imaginable, but that I had better keep a backup atlas in the car also because if the technology went down I would be hopeless), but it's got a great little thing that goes on the shoe & is called a foot pod which pretty much solves my difficulty, because once I realize I'm lost I no longer have to somehow find my way back to the correct measured course and then guess where I should stop so as not to exceed the training plan--the device tells me pretty much exactly how far I have run! And on this occasion, I headed back round the bridle path again and then up north in vaguely the right direction and in a happy coincidence hit the right mileage at the spot in the north-west corner of the park that's my preferred stop-start point. (The foot pod data is not 100% accurate, but it's quite good because you calibrate it on a measured track and give it an adjustment factor that takes your stride length into account.)
3. A wholly eleemosynary thing I also love about the device: the term "foot pod." It's irresistible! I tried to pin down what I found so funny about it, and realized that it reminded me of something from one of the Chronicles of Narnia, books that I read so often as a small child that they are pretty much engraved in the wrinkles of my brain. The Dufflepuds and the Monopods...
I chuckled at this post, not least because the one thing I can say about myself - perhaps my sole gift - is that I can find my way anywhere. Naturally - there must be some law about this - the one time I relied on a GPS device in a hire car, I got thoroughly lost. Either I programmed the thing wrong or whichever waves it uses to communicate with the satellites frizzled the direction-finding cells in my brain.
My sense of direction extends to up and down, and that is only because I doublecheck by dropping things.
The first thing your Polar RS200sd link says is that it is for "competitive, goal oriented runners". ;-)
Brit kid lit -> yeah, I can believe that it permanently encodes in the gross physical structure of the brain.
Yes, gravity is helpful, it is a design flaw that we do not also have an internal points-of-the-compass calibration tool built in.
The Polar description is pretty funny, isn't it?!? I am not sure "competitive" is exactly right, certainly "goal-oriented"...
I was laughing at myself as I looked back at this post in that I really see that children's books have seriously shaped my entire understanding of the world!
The part I forgot to write: in a way (to take an optimistic view) I am exactly the kind of person Central Park was designed for, you are supposed to be taken in by these trompe l'oeil landscaping-type effects & lose your orientation to the city!
me too. i have a terrible sense of direction. i like maps but have a hard time connecting the abstract to the real, as i am more comfortable in the abstract. loved the picture from narnia book too.
great to hear you're running well and feeling good. by the way, a tip i read today for athletes and others. cherries are a natural anti-inflammatory. someone is capitalizing on this by selling special cherry juice to the rangers and some other athletes, but i think it works just as well to buy any kind of cherry juice or just eat a lot of cherries. the guy who started this cherry pharm juice company discovered cherries helped reduce pain with his own injuries...
Design flaw indeed.
I will eventually find my way.
But it helps if I have a map. ;-)
Yes, and maps are good not least because they contribute to a sense of mental calmness that aids decision-making on directions.
N., I've been eating a lot of cherry jam recently, maybe that counts! And dried sour cherries also, they are quite delicious (like a kind of all-natural Starburst, very good). Interesting, I had not thought of them being a remedy, but this is good...Fallout 3 Operation Anchorage Review
The truth is that Operation Anchorage is neither brilliant nor terrible: it's simply a sidestep that doesn't quite work.
While we've (hopefully) come a long way from the days of Oblivion's ridiculous Horse Armour, it's still hard to judge the true value of DLC packs. Anything would seem good value when compared to that ridiculous £4-for-one-item fiasco, and yet large expansion packs are still relatively rare, so there isn't much scope for making critical comparisons. On the one hand, 800 MS Points is roughly the cost of an adult cinema ticket - so that seems like a reasonable price for three or four hours of additional gaming. But from another perspective, those 800 points could also buy you an entire game from Xbox LIVE Arcade.
From a reviewer's point of view, it's hard to discuss such small portions of gameplay without ruining the few genuine surprises that they may offer. While we'll do our best to avoid too many spoilers here, the fact of the matter is that we'll have to be quite specific about Operation Anchorage. This is not just a more-of-the-same expansion to Fallout 3's post-nuclear role-playing, but an unusual attempt to take the game in a different direction. And unfortunately for all concerned, it's not one that entirely works.
After you've coughed up your cash and downloaded the new package, you may be at a bit of a loss as to what you're supposed to do. For some reason Bethesda gives no indication of where your new content can be found, an oversight that will no doubt cause immediate panic in nervous gamers across the land. As it turns out, all you need to do is to load up any of your saved games: within moments you'll get a mysterious distress call that summons you to a new location called Bailey's Crossroads, in the south of the map. Once you get there (we had to go via underground Metro tunnels from Marigold Metro station) you'll find a group of Brotherhood Outcasts fighting off a few Supermutants. Help defeat the muties, and you'll complete the first of OA's four missions - netting yourself some XP, and an Achievement to boot. Consider this your reward for just showing up - and in the case of PC players, for wrestling with Games For Windows.
Once the mutants are dead, the Outcasts will ask you to help them crack open a weapons storage facility they've been trying to break into. The only way to get in is to complete a military training simulation of Operation Anchorage - a famous historical battle that saw US troops defending Alaska from invading Chinese troops. The Outcasts warn you that this is a "safety off" simulation, so if you die in game you'll die for real; but if you survive you'll get a share of the loot.
What this essentially means is that you get to play through roughly four hours of Fallout 3 vs Call of Duty: Winter Edition. All role-playing elements of the game are completely scaled back, resulting in a simple first-person shooter with added VATS. There's very little in the way of pick-ups: ammo and health are now dispensed via little machines dotted around the maps, and because your enemies disappear when they die, it's impossible to loot corpses. As a result of these changes, and the fact that you are now fighting Chinese soldiers, it's quite remarkable how different it all feels from the Fallout 3 we know and love.
Unfortunately, in this case being different isn't a particularly good thing. Aside from the fun and games of VATS, combat was never Fallout 3's strong suit. Your enemies are as brain-dead as ever, and the chances are that you'll cut through them like a hot knife through butter. While you don't have access to any of your old equipment, your in-simulation character retains the same stats as your "real-world" adventurer - and indeed it's possible to level-up while you're playing. If you happen to be at a reasonably experienced stage when you join Operation Anchorage (we used a save at level 15) then you'll barely bat an eyelid, never mind break a sweat.
Indeed, you'll find Operation Anchorage a particular cakewalk if you make use of its shiny new toy - the gauss rifle. As veterans of Fallout 2 will know, the gauss rifle is a super-destructive weapon that uses magnets to accelerate its bullets. In this incarnation, the rifle is a scoped single-shot weapon that does even more damage than the UFO Handgun. It also boasts a rather neat shockwave effect that sends your opponents flying - so in the rare event that they survive a hit, they'll be in no position to fight back. You'll pick up the gauss rifle in OA's first assignment, a mission that sees you sabotaging three artillery guns at the summit of a clifftop base.
After a brief and half-hearted attempt at encouraging stealth tactics, everything goes Rambo and Bethesda teams you up with a NPC who fights alongside you. In truth you don't really need his help, but his anti-Commie tirades are quite entertaining. Then in the second phase of Operation Anchorage you're placed in charge of a squad of up to four soldiers and/or robots. You can choose what weapons they take, and what you yourself are armed with, but other than that your control over the squad is very limited. Your task in this second stage is to attack and capture two locations; you can tell your men to meet you at either one, and then you can tell them to attack or to wait for a bit. That's pretty much it - you can't give orders once an attack has begun, but you can order in new troops if any of your guys kicks the bucket. This certainly has its uses: when our sniper stubbornly refused to leave a building, we simply executed him then went outside and asked for a new one.
Once you've captured both locations, your squad is taken away from you and you're sent on one last assault. And then it's over. You leave the simulation and go back to the wasteland, whereupon you gain access to new weapons and a few other toys. Aside from the gauss rifle, the best of these presents is the cool-looking Chinese stealth armour that cloaks you when you crouch. The Crimson Dragoon warriors who wear this gear are actually the most interesting opponents you meet during Operation Anchorage - sneaky melee fighters who attempt to take you down in Predator fashion. Unfortunately, these guys also show off a slight lapse in gaming logic: while cloaked, the Dragoons can just about be seen as weird vision blurs - yet VATS is unable to target them. This results in a weird situation when you have to randomly spray at them until they show up. They'd probably be a bit easy if you could VATS them straight away, but it feels like a bit of a gaffe, nonetheless.
There are other things that don't make sense (a training simulator that kills you?), but the larger problem with Operation Anchorage is that it simply lacks the immersion-factor that makes Fallout 3 so addictive. The Alaskan scenery is admittedly very nice to look at - particularly the cliff-based sections - but the actual gameplay itself is pretty shallow. The battles are longer and larger in scale than your standard wasteland scrap, but they're far less involving. You're no longer playing a role, you're simply going through the motions of yet another FPS. The whole experience will last you about three hours, and once it's complete the simulator locks itself off. There's a minor perk you can gain by collecting intelligence files dotted around the maps, but if you're going for it you'd better do it first time, since there's no going back.
This all sounds a bit doomy and dour, but the truth is that Operation Anchorage is neither brilliant nor terrible: it's simply a sidestep that doesn't quite work. It's linear, simplistic and extremely un-Fallouty, but it does have couple of decent items and it offers a fresh change of scenery. If you think that's a fair swap for 800 Points, then go ahead and try it. Personally, we're not entirely convinced. Let's hope that the next two DLC packs, The Pitt and Broken Steel, fare better.

The game does explain why you die in the sim, via the technician and the terminal nearby.
My thoughts were pretty similar to Mr. Kellys. It's interesting how very different the game seemed just by adding snow and simplifying loot. It confirmed for me, though, that a large bit of what makes Fallout 3 so special is the setting, itself.

By ISAAC BASHEVIS SINGER; Isaac Bashevis Singer, who writes in Yiddish, won the Nobel Prize for literature in 1978.
Published: August 12, 1984
On the occasion of New York Shakespeare Festival's production of ''The Golem'' by H. Leivick, opening this Thursday at the Delacorte Theater in Central Park, I have been asked to express an opinion about why the myth of the golem - an artificial man created, among other instances, to defend the Jews of Prague in the sixteenth century - has interested so many creative people in the past and continues to do so even today in our epoch of science and technology. In the Yiddish tradition I will answer the question with a question: why shouldn't this legend have influenced and intrigued creative minds? It possesses the tension and the suspense of the supernatural. It word ''golem'' is mentioned in the Bible only once, in the Book of Psalms; ''Thine eyes did see mine unformed substance.'' It was understood as something potential, like an embryo, or perhaps like the stuff which the occultists call the astral body. Only in later times has the word golem come to mean an artificial man created by magic. The prophets have constantly warned the people of Israel against the belief that man could ever compete with God's creative powers. But there was always a concealed hope in man that somehow he could solve the riddle of Creation and break the code to its secrets.
But the basis of the Golem myth - Jewish mysticism, or the Cabbalah as it was called later - is as old as the Bible and perhaps even older. carried from generation to generation. The mystery of Creation as it is described in this esoteric book is contained in the 22 letters of the Alphabet and in the various names of God which can be combined from them. God Himself was supposed to have used them in creating the world. The Talmud tells us of an interpreter by the name of Rabba who formed a man by this mysterious power and also of some others who created a calf for themselves on the eve of the Sabbath and ate it for the Sabbath meal.
The golem myth includes female golems. In his excellent monograph on the golem legend, Rabbi Byron L. Sherwin tells us of a female golem created by the great Jewish poet and philosopher Solomon ibn Gabirol who suffered from a severe skin sickness, perhaps leprosy, and had to live in isolation. He was said to have created the woman golem to keep house for him, to be his companion or perhaps his concubine. According to the legend, this golem was put together from wood and hinges - not a very convenient helpmate for a genius with a vulnerable skin. He was forced to get rid of her only when the religious leaders discovered her. Obviously, a female golem did not menstruate and did not need to take ablutions in the ritual bath to be cleansed for copulation. Also, since a golem is not born from men's semen and is not grown in a woman's womb, there was no sin in destroying her.
So strong was the belief in the golem among Jewish scholars that one of them, Rabbi Zvi Ashkenazi, debated whether a golem can be included in a minyan - a quorum of 10 men which the law demands for various religious ceremonies.. The Jews of Prague were in great danger because of accusations brought against them, one being that they used Christian blood in baking their matzohs. This golem was supposed to have been made of clay by Rabbi Loew or Leib, a Talmudic scholar, a renowned Cabbalist and also a worldly man for one in his time. In his writings he discusses astronomy, geography and other scientific matters. In his book, ''Be'er Hagolah,'' he defended the Talmud against its severe critics who tried to find in it many follies and heretical statements. In one case, the Talmud was assailed for permitting a certain position in sexual intercourse which the anti-Talmudists considered a perversion. Rabbi Leib argued almost like a modern man, pointing out that since man gives to the woman form and spiritual exultation by his love, there is really no difference in how the act is performed. It is not an accident that Rabbi Leib's golem has gained more fame and inspired more novelists and playwrights than any other golem legend before him or after.
As far as H. Leivick's play is concerned, he made his golem not only a defender of the Jews, but also a philosopher and one who asked the eternal questions. I am sure that none of those worldly writers like Leivick, Gustav Meyrink, Arthur Holitscher, Johannes Hess and others believed that a golem did exist and worked all the miracles ascribed to him. But I am convinced that these writers felt in the legend of the golem a profound kinship to artistic creativity. Each work of art has the elements of a miracle. The golem maker was, essentially, an artist. Art is a profession that can not really be taught. Emile Zola's dream of rational and scientific art was never realized. Writers, painters, sculptors, composers of music have often been probed as to how they create; what comes first, the idea or the topic; where and how do they get their inspiration. But no matter how willing the artists were and how hard they tried to explain their motivations and methods, they never succeeded. It always seemed that they were unwilling to divulge their secrets, the combination of style and theme, mood and purpose which made them do what appeared to the disciplined mind the impossible - playing a game without rules.Google and Netflix are both aware of the matter. The former's Don Merrill says that the problem is that the Netflix app is freezing your phone or tablet while it is locked which makes it look as though your phone has been turned off. Merrill suggests that until a fix is sent out, those with a Nexus device running Android 4.3 either refrain from updating to the new build (unless you just bought the new Nexus 7, of course) or uninstall the Netflix app until the bug is killed dead. He also says that Google has its top men working on a solution, so don't let this keep you up all night!
The actual issue is that the Netflix app causes your phone to freeze while locked, giving it the appearance of being powered off.
So, if you use the Netflix app on your Nexus 4 (and especially if you have a Chromecast!) either stick to 4.2.2 or uninstall the Netflix app until the issue is fixed."-Don Merrill, Google

Columbus Public Safety spokesman Lt. Matt Myers says the Columbus Police SWAT Team executed a high-risk search warrant at 4970 North Indianapolis Road Monday after narcotics detectives learned that 43-year-old Michael Sample Sr. was allegedly selling crystal methamphetamine from the home.
Myers says during the execution of the search warrant, narcotics detectives found a substantial amount of crystal meth and other street narcotics that will be sent to the State Police Lab for identification. Detectives also seized money believed to be used in Sample Sr.'s illegal drug activity. Marijuana and drug paraphernalia were also found and seized as evidence.
Sample Sr. is currently on house arrest and was preliminarily charged with possession of more than 3 grams of methamphetamine with intent to deliver, possession of marijuana and maintaining a common nuisance. He is lodged in the Bartholomew County Jail. Myers says police detectives believe the crystal meth Sample Sr. was distributing in our area was manufactured outside of the United States. This investigation is continuing and more arrests could occur.
Myers noted that the SWAT unit was used to execute this search warrant based on information that Sample Sr. owned or had possession of firearms in the past. He says detectives did locate a CO2 type pistol with the illegal drugs found at the home. The police department had been investigating Sample Sr. for severalYou are using an outdated browser. Please

Build 8885 and 8905 Changes
Several Resto-related changes occurred with the release of two beta builds this week:
- Tree of Life mana cost reduced from 978 to 684 Mana. Now increases healing received by raid members by 3% (instead of 25% of your spirit) – Shapeshift into the Tree of Life. While in this form you increase healing received by 3% for all party and raid members within 45 yards, and you can only cast Restoration and Barkskin spells, but the mana cost of your healing over time spells is reduced by 20%. The act of shapeshifting frees the caster of Polymorph and Movement Impairing effects.
- Improved Tree of Life now reduces the mana cost of your heal over time spells while in Tree of Life Form by an additional 5/10/15%. (Old – increases the effect of your Tree of Life Aura by 5/10/15%.)
We knew there was a possibility of a change to Improved Tree of Life with the recent change to Buffs and Debuffs, and this change from an improved aura to an additional mana reduction is going to make Druids more efficient than ever. This improved bonus is additive with the base aura of 20%, bringing the total mana reduction on heals over time to 35%. And before you worry about the revision to the form’s description to no longer include mention of Remove Curse, the spell has been moved from the Balance tree to the Restoration tree.
Nature’s Focus now affects Wrath, Entangling Roots, and Cyclone – Gives you a 23/46/70% chance to avoid interruption caused by damage while casting the Healing Touch, Wrath, Entangling Roots, Cyclone, Nourish, Regrowth and Tranquility spells.
The change to Nature’s Focus is odd in that it frees Moonkin from having to spend three more points in the Balance tree but requires an additional 3-point investment in Restoration when the spec already complains of too many essential points being lumped into Restoration. I’m not sure of the rationale with that change other than to grant Restoration some additional solo capability, but I’m guessing we’ll see at least one more round of talent slimming for our feather-bottomed brethren.
Abolish poison now lasts 1 minute on the target. (Previously lasted 8 sec)
Stupid-OP-Shadowsteppin’-Hemo-Rogue-Say-What? Oh, I’m sorry. You can’t talk right now because your mouth is full of Barkskin! ^_^
Healing Touch base healing reduces for all ranks. Mana cost also reduced.
In the process of testing the [Glyph of Healing Touch], (thank you, Leiyan!) I discovered that the base, untalented casting time of Healing Touch has been reduced from 3.5 to 3.0. That means with the Glyph and a Nature’s Grace proc, I was casting Healing Touch in 0.4 seconds with just a little bit of spell haste. This is pretty cool, but remember that you have to wait at least 1.0 seconds before casting again (or 0.6 seconds after the spell completed) since nothing can currently lower the Global Cooldown below 1.0 seconds. I suspect that this is a bug of some sort since my spellbook listed ranks 1 and 2 of Healing Touch as insta-cast, rank 3 as 1.0 seconds, and ranks 4+ as 1.5 seconds (when I removed all haste items).
Again, I’m pretty sure this is a bug so I didn’t investigate coefficients too much further, but it appears that the Glyph is actually reducing the healing done by less than 50% (an approximate 46% reduction to the base and 39% to the spell power coefficient). Combined with the casting time reduction, this would result in an HPS increase over an un-glyphed Healing Touch of somewhere between 36-52%, depending upon spell power. This would ostensibly make it the highest HPS raid heal available to us, though again, more analysis and a confirmation of whether this change was intention is needed. This would also slightly reduce its HPM.
P.S. With the changes to allow the use of items in Feral forms, it is possible to switch to Cat Form, begin drinking, and activate Prowl. As with Shadowmeld, however, you cannot begin drinking while prowling and retain stealth.

Sorry, the comment form is closed at this time.
Woohoo, thanks for the confirm on that drinking in forms Phael ^^ It’s especially awesome since it’s just doable with a macro to instantly drink and instantly prowl after
Mmmmm, we are going to be so incredibly mana efficient! And being able to cast remove curse, woo! That made my day
(doesn’t take much I know). Interesting about Healing Touch, I can’t wait to see how that plays out live.
Emees last blog post..Why I love Healing
Wow. Just.. wow. I am soooo staying restoration when WotLK comes..
1 minute on abolish?? 35%! Mabey the deathknights won’t pwn our face in after all..
I saw this video on Youtube a little while ago. And since then I’ve hoped we’d be able to eat AND fish in all forms. As a feral I’ve always been a bit jealous of trees and boomkins for their ability to eat in their respective forms.
Wait – what? I had missed the HT cast time reduction. So with 5 points in Naturalist, it will be a 2.5 sec cast. Wow, that’s… interesting. I’m still adjusting to HT being a bigger part of the spell rotation, and this just adds to it. My gut feel is that healing is going to be a lot more complicated, with more choices to make. And I think that’s a good thing.
I would give a lot for bears to be able to fish like this. Or even better, to be able to fish in Aquatic form… how cool would THAT be? I don’t know how that mechanic would work… but the thought is so cool that I don’t care! Maybe a new Fishing ability: Feral Fishing. Trained from any fishing trainer – or even requires completion of a quest. Can be used in any feral form. Requires the same cast time as regular fishing. Operates at melee range, so to fish a spawn point you go stand in the pool. Doesn’t require a fishing pole — but you probably still want one to take advantage of +fishing lures and lines.
Won’t happen I’m sure. But I can dream!
ciskos last blog post..Druid items – from Healing to Tanking
Any idea if Engineering grenades can be used in feral forms?
Thanks!
Heh, abolish got reverted to 8s. I saw that coming.
Also, what do you think about the new, nerfed “Gift of the Earthmother”? I was loving the idea about a 1s GCD… Oh well.
“# Gift of the Earthmother (Tier 10) changed to – Reduces the base global cooldown of your Rejuvenation and Lifebloom spells by 2/4/6/8/10%, and causes your Healing Touch and Nourish spells to refund 1/2/3/4/5% of their base cost for each healing over time effect on the target.”
I can only hope that we’ll have so much haste gear around that it’ll get inevitably to 1s anyway.
Ouch, I liked “Gift of the Earthmother” so much..
I think I’ll still get it, but instead of 2/3 Living Spirit and 5/5 on GotE I’ll leave it 3/3 and 4/5 or something like that. Too bad, but it’s true it would be making haste useless for HoT-druids again..
Anyway, with so many good talents around, I still don’t see Healing Touch in the picture.. There are just too many choices before Naturalist, and I feel really comfortable with HoTs. Maybe it’ll be great for 5 and 10-man instances, but in 25, where there are many direct-heal experts, I’d rather keep my distinctive style
Hey Phae,
I did alot of testing on the gcd of the fast HT. It is still 1.5s without haste. But at those casting speeds latency really chews into the rate of casts you can sustain without using a stopcasting macro.
I was experiencing wildly variable server latency between 92 and 332ms while testing using the below procedure. I was so annoyed I actually wrote an addon borrowing quartz methods to give real numbers with high precision. In fact the gcd was easy to find using the wowAPI.
GCD test procedure;
Use this macro once and then spam your normal HT button. But try and avoid getting the spell isn’t ready message by watching the the cooldown on the button.
/script Stopwatch_Play();
/sw 20
/cast healing touch
checking the results;
A GCD of 1.5 will result in 13.3 casts of HT
(QUARTZ showed a latency that was between 92 and 332ms)

@Andrige: No worries. That’s a good idea.
@Emee: If nothing else, I think the fast-casting Healing Touch will help us stand up to Arena teams whose DKs make using HoTs a death sentence.
@Ermengol: Me too!
@Tiagantar: It’s back to 8-seconds. Return to face-pwnage.
@Oni: I definitely think bears should be able to fish by hopping into pools. And Cat Form should get a “VERY UNHAPPY debuff while swimming. ^_^
@Cisko: All these changes and new spells makes me wonder what kind of a gamepad I’m going to need when the next expansion is released. I’m already having a hard time fitting everything I want onto my action bars, even with an alt key.
And the feral fishing would actually be pretty easy to implement. There’s a quest in the Draenei starting area where you have to swim into a pool and use a net to catch fish. I imagine bears could do the same thing sans net.
And maybe instead of fishing lures, bears could rub themselves with some stinky stuff to help attract fish!
@Ools: I’m afraid that I’m not an Engineer to test that, but I’ll ask my guildmates to see if any of them know. Good question!
@Hokuto: The chance to GotEM is pretty disheartening. I guess they decided that the combined effect was too powerful, even for a 5-point talent that’s nearly at the bottom of the tree. *Sad panda*
@Ermengol: I’m guessing there must be a reason for all these direct “raid” heals being made available to us. I’m expecting them to be useful in some regard.
@Arielore: Thank you for sharing your results; that’s very interesting! You should put that modified stopwatch addon up. It sounds really useful to theorycrafters.Sony Ericsson Z500

It's been a good ride
I've had this phone for nearly 3 years now and it has served me faithfully. Bear in mind that the new features that have come along since 2004 make it not so glamorous anymore but it doesn't deserve to be slammed for that.
Bottom line: If SE added Bluetooth and Walkman to this phone I would buy another one in a heartbeat; or if AT&T would re-release this phone as is, I'd seriously consider it. Here's why:
Pros:
-Extreme Durability
It's a tank! I carry it in my hip pocket wherever I go. It travels with a lot of junk in there and has been squeezed and poked mercilessly. I've also dropped it a few times.
-Inexpensive
It wasn't the cheapest at the time, but it did go on free specials periodically and now it's so old that they should pay you to take it if it's tied to a contract. I'm frugal with my money so this was a perfect fit.
-Loud ringer/earpiece
I don't know how it stacks up against other ones, but I can hear it in pretty loud surroundings and it is much louder than the Motorola V180 I tried out between my Nokia 5125 and this one. It's ringer was useless sometimes.
-Clear call quality
Never had a complaint.
-Powerful yet nearly silent vibrator
A good feature when sitting in a quiet classroom. (Other college students, notice.)
-Good displays, inside and out
The external display shows all the important information and is easy to see.
-Menus/interface
This is the reason I won't buy anything other than another SE for now. I've been trying other phones as this one is getting old, but they all fall short of my SE. It's easy to get around this phone with few keystrokes.
I could go on, but you may have stopped reading already. I've got to talk about cons.
Cons:
-No Bluetooth
I can't exchange ringtones with friends or use wireless headsets A cheap data cable is nice to have.
-Locking up
Seldom does this on its own. Might if I drop it. Better than many out there.
For the record, This phone is thicker but smaller than RAZR.

Decent But Could Be Better
I got my Z500 when I renewed my contract with Cingular in 2005. My Z500 was the promotional "Star Wars" edition, which came pre-loaded with a short video, several pictures, a few soundclip ringtones, and the "Revenge Of The Sith" trial game. It also came packed with a coupon for a free movie ticket to "ROTS", as well as one for a Star Wars faceplate. Used the movie ticket coupon (sweet!!), but never got the faceplate after mailing in the coupon (grrr!!).
As for the phone itself; I experienced the same shortcomings as most other Z500 owners. To me, it wasn't as bad though, or maybe I just didn't let it get to me. The user interface was easy to navigate, the camera was decent enough for a camphone, and I never experienced many dropped calls, if any. Overall, it was a basic phone that did its job in being "basic".
The only frustrating gripe I really have is, again, the same thing that many others here have noted... the dreaded firmware "crashes". This only happened to me while viewing pictures. As I clicked and viewed each one, the screen would sometimes go totally blank, and I'd have to click the button a few times to get it to show up again. Very frustrating!
I wish I could write a better review, but I'm too lazy, and I'm surprised I even got this far. Basically put, if I had to buy this phone again, I wouldn't. It's not worth the frustrations of constant firmware "crashes".
I sometimes browse eBay to see what the prices are for these Z500's, and how pathetic it is to see some cellphone dealers trying to unload this thing for anything more than $25 (seriously, I wouldn't go paying more than that for this phone if I were you).
If you're looking for a back-up phone or just a cheap temporary replacement, go for it. Also consider the Motorola SLVR L6, which is a really great in-between model of the older L2 (no camera) and newer L7 (has iTunes).

Good phone, but there are other phones better
Good phone, but just like the title says, there are a lot better phones out there than this one. Also, like all phones, it has it's pros and cons:
Pros:
>Reception is great. I get full service in a lot of places where others don't get much if any signal at all.
>Downloads ring tones, wallpapers, games, etc. very quickly.
>Changable face plates aren't really a pro, but it's nice to have the customization option available.
And now the
Cons:
>Very bulky phone for a clam shell. Better phones out there just as good, but smaller.
>Camera: normally a good thing, not with this phone. Camera quality freakin sucks. The videos aren't bad, but the pictures would look better carved in stone than on this phone.
> The dang thing laggs sometimes and shuts off by itself.
>It's got the stupidest ring tones on a phone that I've ever heard.
>Freezes to where you have to remove the battery just to get the stupid thing to work again.
The phone is alright. Sony is a great company for electronics. I have a PS2, my Subwoofers in my car are Sony Xplods, my DVD player is Sony, and my Phone is Sony. This phone would have been cool back in the 19th century, but come on folks, face it. WE'RE IN THE 20TH CENTURY!!! If you're someone who wants/ needs a phone with some freakin sweet stuff and you want a Sony Ericsson, buy either the S710i or the W600i/W550i. Either one are great phones from Sony. I myself am going to upgrade to one of those two hopefully soon. If you're an older person who doesn't know/want to work one of the newest phones b/c you'll be spending half of your time looking through the manual to see how the blasted thing works, then this phone would be for you. As for me, this phone really sucks and I need to upgrade.

OK - certainly not great
I have had the z500a from Cingular for a little over a year. The thing I like best about it is it's email capabilities. I can check my Yahoo! mail from it. It will download the headers only, so as to not waste the kB I have to pay for, and I can only read that way the specific emails I want to. Compared to literally every other camera phone I've seen, this one is sub-par. The pictures are of pretty poor quality. And the biggest problem is it now restarts itself about 1 out of every 4 times I answer the phone. I.e. it'll ring, I'll either open it to answer it, or push the answer button, and the OS will restart! It's really annoying. It'll occasionally do it at other times to. It sucks to not be able to answer 25% of your calls! And when dialing, I'd say 1 out of every 5 or 6 times it'll reset when the other person picks up!!
Pros: Email capabilities are GREAT
Operating system
Ringtones (mp3) sound awesome
Cons: After a year it started resetting regularly
Large and blocky; not at all sleek
Overall you just get the feeling Sony Ericsson rushed this one to the market a little before it was finshed being developed...

Not for me
I owned another Sony product, and I figured I would give this one another try, there were no other free phones that I liked. So what the heck right. After a month of having the phone I was selling it. Very slow to navigate and the phone lacks features that make many other phones very useful. Luckily the phone was stolen and I got to get something to replace it, but as I stated in my last review, I gave Sony another try and I was let down again. I will have to really stick to just about anything else.

Have a question about this phone? Ask in the Forum ›Sky 's recent £125 million purchase of Sir Alan Sugar's Amstrad could be referred to the Competition Commission.
The Office of Fair Trading (OFT) is poised to examine the deal , and has set a 22nd August deadline for comments on the acquisition. The OFT is concerned that Sky's buyout could lessen competition in the digital set-top box market and adversely affect Amstrad's rivals - Thomson and Pace Micro .
Why Sky bought Amstrad
Amstrad has long supplied Sky with set-top boxes for the UK market, notably the popular DRX280 Sky+ model (pictured). Amstrad manufactured around 30 per cent of all the set-top boxes purchased by Sky. One of the principal reasons that Sky has snapped up Amstrad is that the satellite broadcaster accounted for a whopping 75 per cent of Amstrad's total revenues.
Sky's proposed acquisition of Amstrad will, says the offer announcement on the Amstrad web site, "provide Sky with an in-house design and development capability, which Sky believes will deliver significant operational and financial benefits."
Amstrad and Sky have reportedly been working together on new generations of Sky+ HD and multiroom Sky+ boxes.PO: What is life like for a busy classical soloist?
JR: It's all glamour - budget airlines, grotty apartments and away from home for 9 months a year! But seriously, I love my job. I sing for a living and at the end of a day's work, I get applauded - what could be better than that!
PO: What is your favourite Brahms composition and why?
JR: My favourite Brahms composition is the Four Serious Songs, one of the last pieces he wrote. They are settings of biblical texts the last of which sets the well-known lines from 1 Corinthians: 'And now these three remain: faith, hope and love. But the greatest of these is love.' The way Brahms sets the word 'love' is one of the most amazing outpourings of ecstasy in all music.
PO: What is Andris Nelsons like to work with?
JR: I read that last year Andris Nelsons was the second busiest conductor in the world! I was lucky enough to sing my first Flying Dutchman with him last year, which was a wonderful experience. Like all the greatest conductors, I believe Andris is a true servant of the music - it's not all about him, how he looks or his hairstyle! A humble but exceptionally gifted musician.
PO: Do you enjoy performing with the Philharmonia?
JR: I've been lucky enough to perform quite a few times with the Philharmonia recently. I can honestly say each concert has been a truly memorable experience. I sang Beethoven 9 in the Beethovenhalle, Bonn; my first Wotan on Wagner's birthday last year; and the icing on the cake was closing the Wagner gala at Buckingham Palace for Prince Charles' 65th birthday. As we say in the business: 'Those were good gigs'!

Beyonce Wants More Girls (to Run the World) as Headliner of Equality Concert
Chime for Change event taps Florence + the Machine, Ellie Goulding, and Haim
Beyoncé, Florence + the Machine, Haim, Ellie Goulding, and more will champion women’s equality during a globally broadcast benefit concert at London’s Twickenham Stadium on June 1, on behalf of Chime for Change. The charity supports equal opportunities for girls and women around the world by focusing on education, health, and social justice issues.
“I have always felt strongly about equal opportunity for women,” Bey says in a statement on the organization’s website (pay attention, Rush Limbaugh). .”
Also on the lineup: Iggy Azalea, John Legend, Laura Pausini, Rita Ora, and Timbaland. More performers, announcements, and broadcast details regarding the charity gig will be revealed in the coming weeks. Tickets are currently available for purchase. Gucci, the founders of Chime for Change, will ensure that all ticket sales go toward the campaign’s various projects. On June 2, every ticket holder will receive a voucher and code that can be applied to one of said projects.
Queen B also threw her weight behind another hot-button equality issue: same-sex marriage. Amid the Supreme Court’s debates about the validity of the Defense of Marriage Act of 1996, Mrs. Carter shared a brief handwritten note on Instagram last night (March 26) that managed to be simultaneously self-referential and empathetic toward others.
“If you like it you should be able to put a ring on it,” she shared, winking at her deathless Sasha Fierce hit “Single Ladies.” The “Bow Down / I Been On” singer also tacked on a cumbersome hashtag, “#wewill unite 4 marriage equality!” before signing simply, “B.”
Now, in case anyone needs a reminder:Between the Lines: The Warren Bump
Looking back to early August, it now seems funny that Sen. Scott Brown’s campaign website would trumpet a collection of quotes mocking Democrats for giving Elizabeth Warren a prime speaking position at the party’s Charlotte convention.
“What’s unclear is whether Warren is the ideal surrogate to deliver that red-meat rhetoric in front of a national television audience,” wrote the National Journal’s Josh Kraushaar, while NBC legacy hire Luke Russert tweeted, “Hard to see the benefit of #Dems giving Warren a prime time slot at DNC considering she’s such a lightning rod for criticism.”.”
Of course, a funny thing happened at the conventions. All the “We Built That” attacks at the Republican National Convention fell flat, with polling showing little bounce for Mitt Romney. But when Democrats, including Warren, doubled down on their populist message, they were rewarded with a significant bump in the polls.
“President Obama believes in a country where we invest in education, in roads and bridges, in science and in the future, so we can create new opportunities,” Warren said at the convention. “We grow [the economy of the future] with opportunity. And we build it together.” That’s the message that helped Obama expand his lead in both national and battleground polling, and which has now led Warren to. 17 after showing Brown leading 48-47 in May. The Republican consulting firm Kimball Political had Brown winning 49-43 immediately before the GOP convention, and leading just 46-45 after the Democratic one.
Those aforementioned pundits truly failed to understand the appeal Warren brings to the campaign. Rather than a disaster for the Democratic Party and Obama, it’s clear Warren’s keynote boosted her chances and contributed to a dramatically successful Democratic convention. They saw her off-the-charts fundraising as a sign of overt liberal partisanship, but her appeal doesn’t lie in partisan rhetoric.
Rather than simply talk about the struggle between the middle class and a system rigged against them, she has lived that fight. As the architect and first head of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, she has been a lone figure reining in a financial sector run amok. In fact, the nascent agency scored its biggest victory recently by forcing Capital One to refund $150 million in fees directly into the accounts of 2.5 million customers, in addition to another $60 million in fines.
Yes, this is the kind of action that inspires liberals, but it’s also the kind of practical populism that wins broad-based public support. Warren’s speaking slot was validation that today’s Democratic Party is no longer afraid of its beliefs or disapproval from Beltway hacks like Luke Russert.
Voters got a look at both the Warren message and the selfish Republican one, and the polling couldn’t be clearer on which resonated best with voters.

Pitt secondary coach Jeff Hafley, like many a young football coach trying to make his mark, has been known to sleep in his office from time to time to maximize the hours he devotes to his job.
Wednesday, just before 10 a.m. on National Signing Day, he escaped to his office for a cat nap. It was the first time in at least a week that he could really relax.
That was because the letter of intent from defensive end T.J. Clemmings -- of Paterson Catholic in New Jersey and the last of the four players from whom Hafley had received a verbal commitment to play football at Pitt -- had rolled off the fax machine minutes before. That meant Hafley's work was finished, at least for a day or so.
"You feel like a kid on Christmas morning, waking up early, wanting to be here near the fax machine and anxiously awaiting those letters," Hafley said. "I haven't slept in like a week. It is part of the pressure of this job, but I love it. You have all these guys who you've invested a year, sometimes two, in talking to and recruiting and getting to know and they tell you they are coming, but you never really know until that letter comes in."
Hafley and the rest of Pitt's staff -- just like the coaching staffs at most every college in the country -- spent a lot of the morning hanging around the fax machine, waiting to get letters of intent from high school athletes.
It is part of an annual ritual for college coaches, a day that is part celebration for a job well done and part relief, because the players who said they were coming actually are.
Wednesday, however, was rather uneventful for the Panthers as signing days go because the staff had secured so many commitments so early and few recruits even hinted that they might be wavering.
In fact, Clemmings was the only one about whom there was even a little bit of a question, and that had a lot more to do with the competition -- he is the top-rated player in New Jersey by a number of scouting services and he several offers.
That's why the loudest cheer -- or, more accurately, sigh of relief -- came when his letter finally came through the fax machine at the South Side football offices at 9:50 a.m.
Until that moment, Hafley paced, nervously checked his phone and his text messages and returned to the fax machine to see if it was plugged in and turned on. That's the nature of the job when your livelihood is dependent on the decisions of 18-year-olds.
"Man, at one point I wanted to make sure there was paper in that thing," joked Hafley, who has been a big part of helping Pitt establish itself in New Jersey. "The worst thing that can happen is, you have to tell your boss that one of your guys isn't coming. But the great thing about working with coach [Dave] Wannstedt is, he's been through it for so long that he understands -- sometimes stuff happens with these kids."
Earlier in the day, the coaches tried to guess who would be the first recruit to send his letter after the signing period opened at 7 a.m.
Would anyone break junior quarterback Pat Bostick's record? His letter arrived at about "7 a.m. and two seconds" on his signing day, according to unofficial records. At 7:02 a.m., the first letter -- from Brandon Sacco, a lineman from Don Bosco Prep in New Jersey -- came rolling off the fax machine.
Surprisingly, there were few snags -- a snowstorm closed two of the schools attended by three recruits and they weren't able to fax their letters until early afternoon -- but that has a lot to do with the fact that Pitt's program has stabilized under Wannstedt and its days of having to scramble for players are long gone.
The coaches told many stories about good surprises on signing day -- players who signed with Pitt who were supposed to sign elsewhere -- as well as bad. Some of the old guard talked about the gloominess of signing day a few years back when five commitments, all of them top players, backed out and signed elsewhere.
Then there were the strange stories, like the one about defensive end Jabaal Sheard, who told the coaches he was walking to the fax machine to send the letter and apparently kept walking, right out the doors of his school.
"I had just got a commitment from him the night before," Wannstedt said while sitting in his office taking in the events of the day. "And so we were feeling good. Then he just froze up and disappeared. Nobody could find him all day long, it took us until like 3 or 4 p.m. until we located him and he said he just didn't know what to do. It was like he went into hiding. We ultimately got him, but that made for some very nervous moments.
"If you look at where we are now, we've already begun on next year's class because those days of having six scholarships to fill the day before are over. I think our program is on the rise and we're to the point where we know what we are looking for and we secure the players we need early enough that signing days will hopefully be uneventful, other than the usual -- a kid forgets to sign something or whatever -- from now on."
Wannstedt has been a master at reeling in late commitments in recent years. Some of the best players he has signed are ones he got to commit in the week leading up to signing day after winning long, drawn-out recruiting wars.
And that part of it, the act of closing the deal, is his speciality. That's one of the reasons he's known as one of the top recruiters in the country. It is also the part he enjoys the most. So next year, he might opt to add a little drama to signing day.
"I really wish we had one left because, I'll be honest, I missed that part of the game," Wannstedt said, smiling. "Next year, maybe I'll hold one or two back for the late January push so that I can get back into the game a little bit more. I'm probably one of the few coaches who gets in every single commitment's home and I call them all the night before signing day, but there is something about being able to close the deal on a guy who has a lot of other coaches calling him that makes recruiting a little bit more special to me."

Chocolate-Peanut
Butter Spread
Tips: This is a quick and easy
treat for toast, apple slices, or graham crackers. I have used store-bought
chips very successfully here. I prefer to use a peanut butter that
is reduced in sugar and sodium content (Jif makes one, but other
companies might, too), but you can use any smooth peanut butter
for this recipe. Note that I have not tried making this with a reduced-fat
peanut butter, nor have I used an all-natural peanut butter, the
type that separates upon standing (I don’t think the latter
would be a good idea for this).
Make sure you don’t skip the processing step; this isn’t
nearly as good without it. Initially and for some hours after this
is made, it is quite thin, but it hardens up within half a day or
so to a good spreading consistency. A nice treat to ease those back-to-school
blues or as part of a play tea.
Yield: 2 cups
Ingredients:
Method:
Combine all ingredients in medium microwaveable bowl. Microwave
at 50% (medium) power for one minute, then stir thoroughly. Microwave
for further short intervals (about 30 seconds) at 50% (medium)
power until almost smooth. Stir until smooth and melted (mixture
will be thin).
Pour mixture into workbowl of food processor fitted with steel
blade. Process at high speed for three “bursts” of
about ten seconds each, or just until mixture is smooth. Pour
into heat-resistant container of at least 2-1/2 cup capacity.
Cool completely before covering tightly (mixture will still be
thin when cooled, but it will gradually thicken). Store at cool
room temperature for up to two weeks.Book your room at Y Hotel Hyde Park

He was testifying before the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence.
Any fresh strike by the group in India or anywhere else would hurt U.S. national security interest and its counter-terrorism interests in the region, Michael Leiter, Director of the National Counter-terrorism Center told lawmakers.
“What we have not yet seen is a history of them doing so. We are certainly concerned by some indicators we see of them expanding their horizons beyond the region.
Certainly they have the capacity -- it’s a large organisation,” he said.
The U.S. intelligence chief's comments came as a powerful lawmaker took the Pak’s ISI to task for not handing over to India, those responsible for the Mumbai terrorist attacks.
India has identified LeT operations commander Zakiur Rahman Lakhvi along with others as the plotters of the Mumbai terror attacks in which 166 people were gunned down.
In his deposition Mr. Leiter said, “What they did in India could theoretically be launched elsewhere. But we have not yet seen those steps occur. I think the additional point that I would stress is they can still be a very destabilising factor in the region.”
“So even without striking in the U.S. or Europe, a further attack by Lashkar-e-Taiba in India would very much hurt our national security and our counterterrorism interests in Pakistan,” Mr. Leiter said in response to a question from U.S. lawmakers.

Following her first rendition from Wine and Death at the Dupla café, Rossmann told the audience how and where she finds her stories. While Rossmann was reading in German, Hungarian actress Bori Péterfy recited the same passages in Hungarian at the city’s Szimpla café, with translator Lajos Adamik acting as a presenter. The two cafés are located next to one another, and are connected by basement vaults, where, following the readings, the audience met for a tasting of wine from the Weinviertel. The translated passages will be printed in the May edition of HID, a Magyar literary magazine published in Serbia.

Scientific. The sentinel also uses alarm calls to alert the group of imminent danger; there is a unique alarm call for each type of predator (bird, snake or another group of meerkats).
Meerkat
Videos
Body length is about 11 inches (29 centimeters). Weight is approximately 900 grams, or just under 2 pounds. There is no sexual dimorphism, although females are generally slightly larger than males.
Range
Meerkats are found throughout the desert and semi-desert regions of southern Africa. Countries include Angola, Namibia, Botswana and South Africa.
Habitat
Meerkats live in desert and semi-desert conditions. Temperatures can reach over 100°F during the day.
Lifestyle
Meerkats are burrowing animals, and often make homes out of abandoned termite mounds or burrows dug by other animals. Meerkats are strictly diurnal; they emerge from their burrows and warm their bodies after sunrise, leave the burrow to forage all day and return to the burrows before sunset. They tend to nap in the hottest part of the day, and then continue foraging..
Meerkat life is dependent on the cooperative behaviors within the group:
- Sentinel: Watches for danger. All group members except kittens can take turns, but usually the older subordinate males will spend the most time as sentinel.
- Babysitters: Stay with the kittens in the den. Usually the job of siblings, but all members of the group can perform this task, except the dominant female.
- Wet nurse: Ousted pregnant females who have lost their offspring and then return and can nurse the dominant female’s kittens.
All meerkats participate in play behaviors. All group members participate in the rearing of the young. This includes babysitting, feeding kittens small insects when they are weaned and teaching them to catch prey once they are old enough. Adults also carry the young during burrow moves or foraging trip if they cannot keep up. Group members groom each other to keep the group free of parasites and to strengthen family bonds.
Food
A meerkat’s diet consists mostly of insects, grubs, bird eggs, small reptiles and the occasional scorpion. Meerkats drink very little water since they get most of the fluids they need from food items. Sometimes meerkats will eat roots and tubers for extra water.
Life Cycle
Meerkat breeding season is usually between October and June, with births between January and March.
The alpha male and female are the dominant breeders, but other meerkats in the group may breed as well. A dominant female may kill kittens that are born to subordinate females to increase the chances of her own kittens’ survival.
Meerkat gestation is 70 days (10-11 weeks). Females give birth to one to three litters a year, with three to seven kittens per litter.
Meerkat kittens’ eyes and ears are closed until about 10 days of age. The kittens emerge from the burrow at 2-3 weeks of age. At 4 weeks, the kittens go on foraging trips with the group, and they are weaned by 9 weeks of age.
All group members help to rear the young. The mother is the primary source of milk. Other mature females can lactate, even if they have never been pregnant, to provide young with milk while their mother is away.
Meerkats reach sexual maturity at 1-2 years of age. Males voluntarily leave the group between 18 months to 3 years of age, usually when they become sexually mature. They often leave the family group with a few of their brothers and form a new group with unrelated females, or take over an existing group by ousting the dominant male assume control if the dominant male has died.
Females do not typically leave their family groups voluntarily. Dominant females will evict subordinate females to eliminate competition, especially if the subordinates are pregnant. Sometimes evicted females are allowed back into the family group, but they may also form new groups.

I think little girls and boys should look like little girls and boys—and not like Victoria’s Secret models and their leering boyfriends.
With so many kids wearing “Abercrombie” I decided maybe I was being too, harsh, too puritanical. Maybe I got my boy shorts into a knot over nothing; then scandal erupted.
Abercrombie started to market a bikini for little girls, as young as 7, with a padded push-up top. Here is a link showing the original ad:
Perhaps Abercrombie has finally shown their true colors through their black and white editorial-style advertising. They have removed the “push-up” from the items’ descriptions as in this link:
For modesty reasons, girls want a lined suit; but enough padding to keep the space shuttle from burning up on reentry? Unsuitable.
Note to Abercrombie & Fitch: if a girl still plays with Barbies, she absolutely should not look like one.

Mice missing a large protein at the junction between neurons show motor impairments, anxiety and increased social behaviors — all features reminiscent of Williams syndrome, a rare developmental disorder. The findings appear online 15 October in the American Journal of Psychiatry1.
The protein, postsynaptic density-95 (PSD-95), sits on the receiving end of a neuronal connection, or synapse. It is part of a key molecular bridge connecting other synaptic proteins — such as SHANK, neuroligins and neurexins — that have been linked to autism and related conditions.
"[The study] bolsters this notion of [the synapse] being at the basis of many kinds of neuropsychiatric disorders," notes Nils Brose, professor of biochemistry at the Max Planck Institute for Experimental Medicine in Göttingen, Germany, who was not involved with the study. "Synapses are the brain's main information processors: as they are perturbed, things go wrong."
Williams syndrome is characterized by mental retardation and a cheerful disposition, and is caused by the deletion of about 25 genes on chromosome 7.
The mutant animals lack DLG4, which codes for PSD-95 and is located on chromosome 17. Intriguingly, this loss seems to somehow affect the genes causing Williams syndrome: the animals express about 50 percent lower levels of CYLN2, a gene in the Williams syndrome region, in the brain compared with controls.
PSD-95 is known to shuttle several types of molecules to the synapse and, once they're in the right place, anchor them there securely. This positioning can have huge effects on how the synapse works.
For example, the first study of a PSD-95 mutant mouse — published by Seth Grant's team in 1998 in Nature — found that the animals have trouble learning spatial routes and have abnormally strong synapses in the hippocampus, a region important for memory2.
In the new report, Grant and colleagues investigate the social, communicative and motor behaviors of mice lacking PSD-95.
Because of the well-known ties between synaptic proteins and autism, the researchers expected the mutant mice to have autism-like features, and they do have some. For example, they repeatedly explore the same arm in a maze, echoing one of autism's core symptoms.
Male mutants produce fewer vocalizations in the presence of females than controls do, which could be akin to the communication deficits central to the disorder. Mutants also have poor balance and an unusual gait — motor problems that are sometimes seen in individuals with autism.
The social interactions of the PSD-95 mutants, however, are decidedly unlike those seen in autism. Presented with a choice between exploring a room with an empty cage in it or a room with a cage holding a mouse inside, the mutants choose the room with the playmate. In fact, they spend even more time with the new mouse than do controls.
"This just blew us away," says lead investigator Andrew Holmes, chief of behavioral science and genetics at the National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism. "Not only were they not spending more time with the object, as you would expect from an autism model, but they were strongly preferring the social stimulus."
Researchers have no good answers for why the loss of some synaptic proteins, such as neuroligins and neurexins, leads to a decrease in social behaviors, whereas losing PSD-95 apparently has the opposite effect.
Brose notes that sorting out these mechanisms is particularly problematic when a mutant animal shows a complex mix of behaviors. The PSD-95 mutants from the 1998 study, for instance, have some memory deficits. If the new mutants have similar problems, that could plausibly explain some of their excessive social interactions in the new study. "[The mutants] might just find the new mouse interesting, over and over again," he says.
To investigate the downstream effects of losing PSD-95, Holmes' team analyzed the expression of more than 8,000 genes in the forebrain of the mutant animals. The researchers found abnormal expression of ten genes related to synaptic function: three genes expressed at higher levels, and seven — including, most notably, CYLN2 in the Williams syndrome region — at lower levels.
"I would be hesitant to say this is a model of Williams syndrome, but there's definitely something interesting going on," Holmes says. "The fact that this gene is down-regulated and that these animals show these behaviors — it must be telling us something about the neurobiology of that disease."
Other experts say it's difficult to tie the findings to Williams syndrome because little is known about when and where the 25 deleted genes are normally expressed in the brain. "Having low levels of CYLN2 in a certain part of forebrain in these mice could mean nothing at all, or it could be really interesting — we just don't know, " notes Lucy Osborne, associate professor of medicine and molecular genetics at the University of Toronto.
Still, the idea that DLG4 somehow affects Williams syndrome genes is bolstered by brain imaging experiments conducted by the team.
Holmes collaborated with brain imaging expert Andreas Meyer-Lindenberg to scan the brains of healthy people carrying certain common variants of DLG4 as they looked at threatening faces.
Individuals carrying one particular variant show two signatures associated with Williams syndrome: low connectivity between the amygdala and the anterior cingulate cortex — a middle region important for regulating empathy and emotion — and low volume of a region near the intraparietal sulcus, a fissure that's involved in eye movements and visual attention.
Because the imaging was done on healthy participants, Holmes says, "It really begs the question: could mutations in PSD-95 produce certain personality traits related to hypersociability and affability?"
Although this human link is "intriguing," Osborne says, it's difficult to make comparisons between a common, non-harmful variant of DLG4 and a mutant mouse that's lacking the gene entirely. To probe the link further, she suggests, researchers could observe the behaviors of mutant mice that are missing only one copy of the gene.

2005 BMW Z4 2.5i 2dr Roadster (2.5L 6cyl 5M)
After a considerable amount of research, I purchased my first BMW about six weeks ago, a Maldives Blue over Beige, 2005 Z4 2.5i roadster with only 13,400 miles. I also have a 1977 MGB; guess I really like roadsters. After looking for a Z3M for a reasonable price, I turned my attention to the Z4. The reviews on the Z4 were, for the most part, glowing and I can say that this is the funnest car to drive I have ever owned.
The power - even with the 2.5, is impressive, but its ability to stick to the road, its handling and its looks make it a winner in my book. It's a lot of fun to drive and to look at!
Handling - The electric-assisted steering is very positive and precise, with input and output feel similar to that of an older light aircraft. Although many don't like the stiffer ride of the run-flat tires, the adhesion to the road and positive control they deliver is, to me, worth the stiffer ride.
Looks - It looks like a modern, stylish sports car! Lots of looks and compliments.
Value - An incredibly good-looking, fun car to drive at a reasonable price; and it's a BMW.
Power top - Thus far, completely trouble free, quick and smooth.
The only thing I've had to have done on my Z4 thus far is to replace the amplifier, which is in a compartment beneath the trunk next to the battery. The amplifier in my car corroded due to a leaking battery, but many others have failed due to water leaking into the trunk compartment; as far as I can tell, the only frequently-occurring design flaw/shortcoming in the car.
This is my first z4 and so far I love driving it. I find my self taking the long way to the stores just to enjoy the drive. I love its sleek, compact and agile performance. People keep telling me I should have traded at 40k but I think I am going to keep it well over 200,000 mile and maybe then some. I call my z4 my mini me.
gas mileage.
2005 BMW Z4 3.0i 2dr Roadster (3.0L 6cyl 6M)
Wow! The Z4 is pure driving excitement! The vehicle has opened up the world of weekend roadtrips for me, but instead of using the GPS, I find myself reading a map to determine an alternate route to my destination. The highways are fun, but the Z4 really shines on the back roads. Some words that come to mind to describe this vehicle are; responsive, tight, nimble, classy, smooth and deceivingly quick. Do not expect a luxury ride from the Z4, but expect to feel the road. It is a performance vehicle. That being said, I am 6'2" and once in the vehicle I am quite comfortable, even on long road trips. I am guaranteed a smile every time I take my Z4 for a drive. :-)
6 speed manual transmission is smooth and forgiving. Surprisingly adequate trunk space, even w/ the top down. Automatic convertible top. Xenon lights seriously improve night time driving visibility.
With the convertible top up, you will make full use of the side mirrors for side & rear visibility.
WOW and to think we waited over three years to finally find and purchase our dream machine. 05 with 22K, CPO and extended maintenance plan, and fully loaded. The tires are pretty sensitive to less than perfect roads and you'll find yourself driving with two hands on the wheel. We actually like the cup holders and the radio rocks!
Power, MPG/fun, cockpit room, one touch windows and power top.
Need more storage compartments in the cockpit. Home link system should be standard.
We purchased this car new in 05 and it has been outstanding. Not a single thing has gone wrong in 40k miles, it gets 32+ mpg on the freeway and combined mileage is 25-26 -- all much higher than estimated! The free services have been great too.
The power top is fast and easy. There is more room in the trunk than you'd expect for suitcases or groceries. A full set of golf clubs fits too. Two sets if not too oversized. Small, so easy to park and really fast to wash and wax. Glad we got both sport and premium packages.
Have to be ready for a bumpy, sports car ride -- you really feel the road with the low profile tires. Fit and finish could have been better -- gaps between some body panels is a bit to wide. Standard stereo should be better.Ankanam Cultural Front: Union Defence Minister A.K. Antony presents 16th Ankanam Sahitya Award to young writer Indu Menon, Calicut Press Club Hall, 10 a.m.

First studio album from Nordic jazz supergroup led by drummer Strønen
Martin Longley 2005
Parish appears to be the name of Thomas Strønen's band, besides being used as an album title. This is a cross-generational quartet with a membership that's split equally between Norwegian and Swedish players. Strønen established his UK reputation as the drummer for Food, an Anglo-Norwegian outfit that also included saxophonist Iain Ballamy. That band is now off the menu, and Strønen's new venture is more concerned with a completely acoustic expression.
Parish came together in 2001, releasing a live album for the Dutch label Challenge, but there is a feeling that they view this set as a fuller development of the band's sound. Bassist Mats Eilertsen is the other youngish member, with pianist Bobo Stenson representing well-travelled experience, and reedsman Fredrik Ljungkvist inhabiting the early stages of middle age. Musically, the members of Parish are deeply sympathetic, operating largely in the whispering zone of extreme sensitivity and chamber attentiveness.
The album begins very quietly, with a careful dialogue between piano and percussion, the bandleader establishing his preference for fleeting cymbal caresses and detailed woodblock clusters. After this brief improvisation (the first of three), Ljungkvist enters for a four-part "Suite For Trio". This opalescent meditation continues the attention to microscopic gestures, with piano and clarinet holding hands for the melody lines whilst Strønen develops his raindrop-pattering techniques.
The second improvisation finds Ljungkvist adopting a capering clarinet progress that reminds the listener of John Surman's rambling adventures. Strønen's composition "Easta" (he's naturally the main writer on this disc) has a surprisingly conventional jazz feel, easing along with a very slow swinging motion, highlighting Stenson's piano line. Eilertsen relishes his only overt solo at the beginning of "Quartz", which just happens to be penned by the bassist.
As the album progresses, it gets close to running out of ideas, but is just saved during the final sequence of pieces. "In Motion" comes as a shock, thirteen tracks in, causing the listener to wake with a start as it perkily introduces what almost sounds like a South African township melody. This is followed straight away by Ljungkvist's "C Moll Maj", which benefits from some sprightly interaction between the composer's halting clarinet, Stenson's spaced-out piano jabs and Strønen's organically mechanical percussion. These pieces represent a late-stage reawakening for this sometimes drifting journey.By Andy Choi
The US Department of Homeland Security protects the country from terrorists and keeps a check on illegitimate travel and trade through the US Customs and Border Security Protection which is also assigned the task of monitoring and screening of sea cargo containers. The check for chemical, radiological, biological weapons, explosives and drugs requires the accurate and quick screening of thousands of ocean cargo containers that enter the US ports every day.
The advanced Test Bed solution enables TSL engineers to simulate the cantilever cranes employed to unload the incoming container ships. It picks up, moves and places a container by mimicking the method and time taken for unloading each container and dropping in on the dock.
The Program Manager at the Science and Technology Directorate, Dave Masters stated that by using a mass spectrometer and a gas chromatograph, one can determine the contents of a 40 foot container in an hour. However, since the atmosphere of maritime container terminal does not provide the flexibility to run experiments, the CSTB aids in replicating not only the screening of the items but also the loading and unloading operations. The sensors need to be robust to survive the containers movements being hauled and slammed on the port.
The S&T researchers are urging technology developers to test various sensors at the CSTB since advanced detection technologies are required for rapidly sensing trace quantities of substances. To determine the presence of drugs, illicit substances and explosives, chemical based sensors can be used. Laser-based detection technologies are currently being developed to determine the physical properties of the target molecules.

Le doesn’t want to wait another year to fight again. He wants to avenge his lone loss.
“I’m hoping to get a rematch with Scott Smith as soon as possible,” he said in a video interview released by Strikeforce on Monday, although he still hasn’t been given word if that is his next fight or not.
He’ll be ready when the call comes, however.

She’s been a part of the endangered white rhino herd at Lion Country Safari for years, and now Lissa is battling for her life.
Veterinarians first noticed the 33-year-old matriarch had an infected horn last year and tried treating it, but their efforts were unsuccessful.
MOBILE/TABLET USERS: Watch The Video
That’s when they decided to anesthetize the 4,000-pound rhino and take a closer look at her horn.
“It was cancer,” veterinarian Elizabeth Hammond said.
Hammond worked with an orthopedic surgeon to determine the best way to treat the horn, which is actually made of hair. They have been removing it for months in a series of surgeries, the latest one in mid-April.
Since then, Lissa has been recovering in seclusion with her grown daughter, Eliza.
“Because they are social creatures, and that keeps her calm and they can hang out together,” Hammond said.
Meanwhile, the rest of the herd of rhinos “probably misses her,” Hammond said.
“The staff here at Lion Country Safari are very attached to these animals,” curator Brian Dowling said. "So we want to go out of our way, do everything we can to give them the best quality of life that we can.”

Researchers followed boys and girls who received the HPV vaccine between nine and 15 years old.
After eight years, they still had the HPV antibodies, had no adverse effects from the vaccine and most had not developed HPV related disease.
However, HPV vaccination rates are only 33-percent and more than 4,000 women are diagnosed with cervical cancer each.Victory Outreach Church Mens Home

THE NEWS
Odd news from around the world
Middle-aged men have ‘hotness delusion syndrome’: “Middle-aged men are being chased so much by single women that they are becoming deluded about their sex appeal. A drought of mid-40s single men, compared with single women of the same age, means they are fiercely pursued, inflating their opinion of their attractiveness. KPMG demographer Bernard Salt, author of The Big Tilt: What Happens When Boomers Bust and Xers and Ys Inherit the Earth, says the imbalance has created a monster he dubs the “hotness delusion syndrome”. And in a case of “beware the cougar”, he believes a lack of eligible 40-something bachelors will result in more confident, well-educated older women prowling for younger mates. “An available male in his 40s receives a lot of attention because he’s the only thing going around,” Mr Salt said.”
Britain’s cheese chase is on again: “Rebel thrill-seekers have defied the English weather to take part in a bizarre competition of chasing a four kilo wheel of cheese down a steep hill. Hardcore enthusiasts staged their own unofficial event .. after the world-famous Cheese Rolling was cancelled for a second year running. The race had been advertised on social networking sites with a page set up on Facebook and people posting messages on Twitter. A large police presence at entrances to Cooper’s Hill, at Brockworth .. near Gloucester .. didn’t deter the faithfull .. with several hundred spectators braving fog and rain to watch about a dozen daredevils chase the Double Gloucester 200 metres down the 1:2 gradient slope. Competitors slip, somersault and tumble their way to the bottom in spectacular fashion during the bone-crunching races – and the first person to grab the cheese winning.”
Croc attack doesn’t stop holiday: “A dentist fought off a crocodile that leaped into his small boat and sank its teeth into his chest while he fished in Australia’s far north-west. Bruce Rudeforth, 59, said the eight-foot (2.5m) reptile came at him in Secure Bay, more than 2000km north of state capital Perth, last Wednesday. “It bit into my shoulder and I stood up and gave it one in the throat with my free elbow,” Mr Rudeforth told the newspaper. “I presume that’s what made it let go.” The crocodile slid back into the water but returned again, forcing the Broome dentist and his fishing companion Neil Fong to hit it with an oar. The pair returned to a larger fishing boat where three other colleagues were waiting. Mr Rudeforth’s brother-in-law – and fellow dentist – stitched closed the puncture wounds. The group then decided to continue their fishing trip in the remote region. “It takes a lot to organise a trip like that, so why come home,” Mr Rudeforth said.”
Woman chopped off man’s penis as he ‘attempted to rape her’ before taking it to police as evidence: “A woman cut off a man’s penis as he attempted to rape her and took it to a police station as evidence against him. Monju Begum, 40, attacked the man in Bangladesh after he burst into her shack and launched his sex attack. The victim then wrapped up the manhood in polythene before handing it over to officers, police said. Mozammel Haq Mazi was rushed to hospital where he is being treated – but is denying attempted rape. He claims he was having an affair with the mother-of-three and claims she attacked him because he refused to settle down with her. The married father-of-five is expected to be arrested once he has recovered.”
Revival of the ukulele: “The merest mention is likely to inspire an impression of George Formby singing When I’m Cleaning Windows. But despite its image as an old-fashioned relic of the music hall, the ukulele is back in fashion. Research for the Musical Instrument Retail Conference found that music shops said the instrument had seen the fastest rising sales in the past year. It seems there are several theories as to why the ukelele – or ‘uku’ as it is nicknamed – is enjoying a revival. Price could be a factor, with a ukulele costing from just £20 and some schools are using them as an alternative to the recorder for musical beginners. There has also been a mini-boom in folk music again, such as Mumford and Sons, which has seen increased sales of traditional acoustic instruments.” [I believe Formby’s instrument was actually a ukulele-banjo]

Mining town has to import burger flippers: “The mining-boom jobs crunch has become so acute in regional Queensland, even fast-food giant McDonald’s has been forced to import burger flippers from Brisbane to work in Mount Isa. Mines have long flown in specialist workers but it’s the first time a Queensland takeaway outlet is known to have resorted to the incentive. Local teenagers have been refusing to work at Macca’s because of the ready availability of other higher-paying jobs in the area. In Mount Isa, the mining town’s only McDonald’s is offering to cover travel costs for anyone willing to take up a full-time job, which pays $718 a week. Employees who stay for four months get a free return bus trip to Brisbane, and anyone staying for more than six months gets a plane ride back.”
Sunglasses ban for Viet cops: “Vietnam,” said the English-language website of state-controlled Tuoi Tre newspaper. “This means traffic cops must not hide behind trees to ambush” and issue fines. The report also said on-duty police were now banned from reading books, making or answering non-work related phone calls, drinking alcohol or eating at restaurants that illegally encroach onto pavements. Vietnam’s traffic police are seen by citizens as notoriously corrupt. Last year US-based Human Rights Watch urged Vietnam to investigate “widespread police brutality”, saying it had documented 19 incidents of reported brutality by law enforcers over the previous year, resulting in 15 deaths.”
America the ‘no-vacation nation’: …. The running joke at Brock’s company is that a vacation just means you work from somewhere else. Only 57% of U.S. workers use up all of the days they’re entitled to, compared with 89% of workers in France”
‘Nannied’ British police given bedtime routines and packed lunch advice: “Police officers are being issued with “lifestyle” guides by their forces, suggesting bedtime routines and healthy eating options for them. Among the pearls of wisdom offered in the documents are that officers should assist their spouses with household chores and do activities such as gardening and dancing to keep fit. The guides even offer advice on what fillings officers should have in their sandwiches. In a survey of UK forces, around half admitted to issuing staff with such guides, which they claim helps ensure the health and wellbeing of officers. But critics say they are “frankly ludicrous” and say that they treat officers like children. Much of the advice relates to healthy eating. One document, from Suffolk Constabulary, suggests officers go shopping on a full stomach, so they are likely to buy less food; another, from West Yorkshire Police, advises them to “eat sitting down” to avoid consuming too much.”
Tourists to be banned from Amsterdam cannabis cafes: “FOREIGNERS will be banned from Holland’s infamous cannabis-selling coffee shops under new anti-drug laws. Under the new rules only Dutch residents will be allowed to enter the shops, which lawfully sell small amounts of cannabis to customers, the Daily Mail reported. By the end of the year customers will have to sign up for a one-year membership, or “dope pass”, to the shops. The legislation, branded “tourism suicide”, has been spearheaded by far-right politicians convinced that the move will discourage the “wrong” type of visitors. Drug tourists have been causing all types of trouble in the country, Joep Delsing, spokesman for the mayor of Maastricht, said. “They block streets in the city centre, they don’t respect parking rules, they are noisy and, when they go from one coffee shop to another, they urinate and vomit in the street,” Mr Delsing said.”

Chinese Doctor vs Western DoctorMay 29, 2011 at 3:09 pm | Posted in Uncategorized | Leave a comment
I think I have put this one up before but what the heck!
While in China, an American man was very sexually promiscuous and did not use a condom at all. A week after arriving back home, ‘I’ve got bad news for you – you’ve contracted Mongolian VD. It’s very rare and almost unheard of here. We know very little about it.’
The man looked a little perplexed and said: ‘Well, give me a shot or something and fix me up, Doc.’
The doctor answered: ‘I’m sorry, there’s no known cure. We’re going to have to amputate your penis.’
The man screamed in horror, ‘Absolutely not! I want a second opinion.’ The doctor replied: ‘Well, it’s your choice. Go ahead if you want, but surgery is your only option.’
The next day the man found a Chinese doctor, figuring that he’d know more about the disease. The Chinese doctor examined his penis and proclaimed, ‘Ah, yes, Mongolian VD. Very rare disease.’
The guy said to the doctor, ‘Yeah, yeah, I already know that but what can we do? My American doctor wants to operate and amputate my penis!’
The Chinese doctor shook his head and laughed. ‘Stupid American doctor, always want to operate. Make more money that way. No need to operate!’
‘Oh, Thank God!’ the man replied.
‘Yes,’ says the Chinese doctor, ‘You no worry! Wait two weeks. Fall off by itself!’

British government department in charge of pest control is closed after insect infestation: “The Government department in charge of pest control has been closed down – by a plague of moths. Officials at Nobel House, the Westminster headquarters of the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra), were forced to call in pest controllers after civil servants complained about the infestation of the common clothes moth. The 850-strong department, headed by Secretary of State Caroline Spelman, was closed to allow all the offices to be fumigated. Civil servants have now dubbed it the ‘Ministry for Moths’.” One suggested the infestation was ‘surprising given the number of Defra plans that have been mothballed’.”
‘Ghost ship’ docks with nobody aboard: “Coast guard officials are investigating the mysterious death of a Connecticut sailor whose 34-ft boat drifted up to a Long Island dock without him. The body of 64-year-old skipper Frank Closter was retrieved on Friday from the waters off the coast of Clinton, 15 miles from where he had set sail. Officials said Closter had likely fallen overboard while the Jagular sailed on to the ConocoPhillips docks in Riverhead early that morning without him. Investigators found the Closter’s glasses, wallet and a chart plotter aboard the vacant ship, which they said helped to locate his body in the heavy fog that surrounded the area on Friday. Coast Guard spokesman John Olsen told the New York Post: ‘There was no damage to the boat – it was in ship-shape. It’s a mystery.’ Olsen said the boat docking without someone at the helm was a ‘one-in-a-million coincidence’, calling the incident ‘kind of strange’.”
How the booms and busts of bra sizes reflect the British economy: “It really is a case of ‘boom or bust’ according to new research claiming women favour bras which mirror the state of the economy.

And today’s women tend to opt for bigger bras than ever before. The ‘History.”

The Darwin Supreme Court heard Angela Elizabeth Honeysett, 25, pulled off her purple top as she ran from the Subway restaurant, which was full of stunned staff and customers, The NT News reports. The topless bandit then jumped into a getaway car and escaped just minutes before police arrived. The court heard Honeysett brandished the knife at staff and threw a pink drawstring carry bag on to the counter telling the shop assistant to fill it with cash.

The clip, posted on YouTube on Tuesday, shows piles of luggage being loaded into a dump truck from a trolley on the tarmac. However, although the airport used an Air New Zealand trolley, the incident had nothing to do with the airline. Communications manager Monique Oomen said the bags had been part of a trial of the new baggage handling system installed at the facility. “We asked locals to donate any old luggage they no longer wanted, and to fill it with old books or newspaper,” Oomen said. “This luggage was then tagged and used to test the system over a period of weeks. At the end, we decided the bags were not good enough for charity and that they had to go out.”

Swedish homeowner faces fine for taking revenge on egg-hurling kids: “A Swedish man faces a hefty fine for chasing after delinquents who hurled eggs at his house and smearing one of the makeshift missiles in a boy’s face. The exasperated Gothenburg resident took matters into his own hands after the mob targeted his home during a trick-or-treat prank last Halloween. He cornered one culprit, took the remaining eggs out of his backpack, then smeared one in the boy’s face. Justice served sunny side up, many would say – but it seems Swedish authorities do not agree. The 35-year-old resident, whom the paper did not name, was charged with harassment and this week ordered to pay a fine of 11,400 kronor ($1800).”

Two officers were also sent to the scene to search nearby gardens in Chalgrove, Oxon, on foot. After tracking down the stunned youngster, he apologised to the greenhouse’s owner and no further action has been taken. Now, police are being accused of overreacting and wasting taxpayers’ money. The boys were playing football in the back garden of the Crown pub in Chalgrove on May 8 when one of the lads mis-kicked the ball. The ball went over the garden wall and struck a greenhouse smashing half-a-pane of glass.”

He fell hard on to the nipple, which was gushing out air, piercing the flesh of his buttock. Mr McCormack’s workmates came rushing to his aid when they heard his screams. Company co-owner Robbie Petersen, one of the first to arrive heard the roar of air rushing into Mr McCormack’s body and quickly released a safety valve to stop the air flow. One of his workmates, Jason Wenham, placed the inflated man on to his side in the recovery position, a move that is thought to have saved his life because it helped him to breathe.” [Graphic at link]

Pope shuts down dancing nuns: “Pope Benedict XVI has shut down a famous monastery in Rome whose unorthodox practices earned the disfavour of the Vatican. The community renowned for its dancing nuns, organised nightclub dances, hosted VIPs like Madonna much to the displeasure of the head of the Catholic Church. The closure of the monastery of Santa Croce in Gerusalemme, which holds some of the Church’s most prized relics, was reported by Italian dailies La Stampa and Il Foglio. The reports said the community of Cistercian monks based at the church for more than five centuries were being transferred to other churches in Italy. The basilica had become a hub for the Friends of Santa Croce, an aristocratic group, and had been criticised for some unorthodox practices including dances in which nuns pranced around the altar. The basilica’s long time abbot, Simone Fioraso, a flamboyant former Milan fashion designer, was already moved out of the basilica two years ago.”

This prompted the school’s head, Chris Wain, to send out letters to parents urging them to think about what they were wearing.”.

Doctors noticed that the baby was developing outside the uterus at 20 weeks, putting Ms Soto’s life at risk. They offered to operate but the 27-year-old declined. Her son, Azelan Cruz Perfecto, was born at 32 weeks at the Banner Good Samaritan Medical Centre yesterday. He will remain in the neo-natal unit for at least a month. “It’s very unusual, she’s very fortunate and we are pleased that she and the baby are doing well,” said Dr Curtis Cook from Phoenix Perinatal Associations. The doctors believe this is the only positive outcome they know of in a cornual pregnancy.”

He held the dog, Bilbo Baggins, for a ransom of £500 before leaving it in a frozen pond. He was found guilty of blackmail and intimidation at Bristol Crown Court. Radzikowski had lived in the flat above Ms Lilly, 48, but he could not afford the rent so had to move out. Ms Lilly was described in court as a local bank director from Beckford Road. He became homeless and was taken in by a local Polish couple, Robert and Maria Jurczak, while he looked for a flat.”

More than 13,258 people liked the Facebook group “Wellingtonians Against the Wellywood Sign”, while others voiced their disdain on Twitter and other websites.

Australia politicians working too hard (?) “Federal politicians struggling with parliament’s extended sittings are demanding more moderate working hours. The Gillard Government agreed to extend parliamentary sitting hours and days during negotiations with independent MPs to form minority government. The agreement resulted in weekly sitting hours being extended by 7.5 hours, with the lower house now sitting about 40 hours over four days. An interim report looking at the impact of the parliamentary reforms said extended sitting hours could have “potential adverse effects” on MPs and their families. Committee chair Julie Owens said concerns about health, work quality and family relationships were “presented strongly” by backbenchers. The House of Representatives should start at midday on Mondays, the committee said, arguing the 10am start time led MPs to “significantly alter” their travel habits.”

The only thing that ever goes on this is a comb and a hairbrush.'”

British Keystone Kops chase escaped tiger that turned out to be a TOY: “When members of the public rang in saying they had spotted an escaped white tiger in a field, police certainly weren’t going to take any chances. Scrambling a helicopter, sending out armed officers and calling in help from a nearby zoo, the hunt for the beast began. But the force’s efforts proved to have been a waste of time – because the ‘tiger’ turned out to be a large cuddly toy. Officers evacuated a golf course near the field and warned locals to stay indoors until they had captured the beast. It was only when thermal-imaging cameras failed to register any heat from the target that officers became suspicious. And when a blast of air from the helicopter blades flipped the ‘tiger’ on to its back, red-faced officers realised they had been stalking a life-size stuffed animal.”

The conscious boy was rushed to nearby Brooklyn Hospital, where he was reported in stable condition. Cops canvassed the Walt Whitman houses along Cumberland Walk in search of the mother. Hours later, cops emerged with a woman from the building’s eighth floor. Neighbors said they wished the mother had sought help. “I saw the baby bundled up,” said one resident. “Thank God it was still breathing. It was a newborn. It’s like someone didn’t want it.

Nasa sting catches woman trying to sell moon rock: “A woman who tried to sell a rare chunk of moon rock for $1.7 million U.S. (£1million) was caught out when her prospective customer turned out to be an undercover Nasa investigator. It is illegal to sell moon rocks, which are considered national treasures. The grey rocks, which were gifted to each U.S. state and 136 countries by then-President Richard Nixon, can sell for millions of dollars on the black market. Nasa agents and Riverside County sheriff’s deputies detained the woman, who was not immediately identified, after she met with an undercover Nasa investigator at a restaurant in Lake Elsinore, south-east of Los Angeles. Mr Gutheinz said the woman could face theft charges if the rock is genuine, or fraud charges if it is not. A recent count showed 10 states and more than 90 countries could not account for their shares of the grey rocks.”
New York’s skinniest house:  ‘meticulously restored’ – and its colourful history and position firmly on the city’s tourist trail will help.

The skinny house even came close to demolition in 1950, before a lawyer stepped in to save it and its neighbours from being razed.”

Bees cause airport chaos: “A swarm of bees has descended upon an airport in the Philippines, causing flight delays and forcing workers to fight back using vacuum cleaners. The bees flew into the passenger tubes at Ninoy Aquino International Airport in Manila, preventing operators from connecting them to arriving planes. Jets were forced to park on the tarmac, with passengers using stairs to get to the their flights, the Philippine Star reported. The gates were closed straight away with authorities saying they endangered both passengers and airport workers. It is believed that a passenger brought the concealed honeybees onto a plane and they escaped. The vacuum cleaner attacks have been successful, latest reports suggest. The airport has been given the all-clear from the bees and operations are back to normal.”

Opposition appeals to Judiciary to stay firm
Wafula Oguttu
Posted Wednesday, March 12 2014 at 02:00
PARLIAMENT.
The opposition has urged the Judiciary to ensure the Executive does not ignore its decisions.
“When a judge makes a decision and the Executive ignores or undermines it, the Judiciary should make its position clear,” Mr Wafula Oguttu, the Leader of the Opposition in Parliament, said yesterday during a press conference at Parliament.
“We appeal to the Judiciary to pronounce itself on the on-going election arrangement for the Lord Mayor of Kampala, which is in disregard of a High Court order.”
His comments come a week after the Electoral Commission (EC) said it would organise an election to “fill the post of the Lord Mayor”.
High Court Judge Yasin Nyanzi, however, on November 28, 2013, nullified the censure vote, ruling that an injunction had already been granted to Erias Lukwago, staying the implementation of the tribunal report that recommended his ouster because of alleged incompetence.
Before the application is dispensed with, Mr Lukwago is still the Lord Mayor even though police time after time blocks him from accessing his office at City Hall.
Mr Oguttu said the EC has a duty to abide by and to execute lawful orders.
“What is itching us is the fact that the EC in total disregard of all the above is now organising an election of a new Lord Mayor. This is fraud. It is a case of intolerance of the civil servants managing the Kampala Capital City Authority and the EC. They find comfort in being used by Mr Museveni as tools of entrenchment of a dictatorship and impunity. This must stop,” said Mr Oguttu.
Mr Oguttu said the opposition is going to engage “relentlessly in legal battles, public action and diplomatic lobbying to end the NRM’s fascist tendencies”.

Novo Nordisk says it needed time to digest the FDA's February Tresiba rejection before making the news public, but Danish authorities disagree and are investigating the drugmaker over its decision to wait two days to make the FDA's decision public, reports Reuters.
The timeline as well as the news are critical aspects to the story, as Reuters notes that although the FDA delivered its decision after Danish financial markets closed, US markets were not, and trades were still possible. The Big Think included an hour-long conference call, reports Reuters, which says the company published the information at night on Sunday, February 10.
The FDA rejection was an investor upset, and the regulator said it needed cardiovascular safety information before it would consider the drug for approval. This fail gave Sanofi's Lantus franchise one less competitor, and delayed Novo's Tresiba entry by a few years.
Sydbank analyst Soren Lontoft Hansen told Reuters that this is more of a reputation problem for Novo, instead of a financial one, but that the financial aspect could become more significant were US shareholders to pursue a joint action lawsuit.Recipe of the Day

BMP did not tell me my order was backordered and I had to call them 1-2 weeks later and ask them where my order is. This is when they told me that I was missing information and they could not proceed with my order, so they canceled it, they didn't bother to tell me. I hate BMP, they have amazing parts and quality, but their owners are pure cocky assholes. I apologize for the delay to all the members whole recently ordered sometime from me from BMP. In the future if you need BMP parts expect it to take a few weeks. Once again, I apologize for their poor customer service.

Synopsis :
The remote Red Hat host is missing one or more security updates.
Description :
An updated libxml package that fixes multiple buffer overflows is now
available.
[Updated 24 May 2005] Multilib packages have been added to this
advisory
The libxml package contains a library for manipulating XML files.
Multiple buffer overflow bugs have been found in libxml versions prior
to 2.6.14. If an attacker can trick a user into passing a specially
crafted FTP URL or FTP proxy URL to an application that uses the
vulnerable functions of libxml, it could be possible to execute
arbitrary code. Additionally, if an attacker can return a specially
crafted DNS request to libxml, it could be possible to execute
arbitrary code. The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project
(cve.mitre.org) has assigned the name CVE-2004-0989 to this issue.
Yuuichi Teranishi discovered a flaw in libxml versions prior to 2.6.6.
When fetching a remote resource via FTP or HTTP, libxml uses special
parsing routines. These routines can overflow a buffer if passed a
very long URL. If an attacker is able to find an application using
libxml that parses remote resources and allows them to influence the
URL, then this flaw could be used to execute arbitrary code. The
Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has
assigned the name CVE-2004-0110 to this issue.
All users are advised to upgrade to this updated package, which
contains backported patches and is not vulnerable to these issues.

CVE ID: CVE-2004-0110C.Putting the “Science” in “Science Fiction” – Railguns
The railgun is a weapon commonly shown or described in science fiction, and works by using an electromagnetic force to launch a projectile down a pair of conductive rails, rather than relying on gunpowder. Although films, like the Arnold Schwarzenegger film Eraser, and novels often refer to all projectile weapons that use electromagnetics as railguns, railguns are just one member of a group of weapons that use these forces.
Research is being conducted into creating this type of weapon because launching a projectile with magnetic forces has many advantages over using an explosion, as gunpowder weapons do. Electromagnetic weapons do not use gunpowder to launch their projectile, and because of this no shell casing is needed. The lack of a shell casing, which takes up far more space than the bullet it surrounds, means that a great deal more ammunition can be stored in a smaller space. The lack of shell casings also means it requires less material and expense to make rounds for railguns and similar weapons, and the ejection ports can be eliminated in order to keep the interior of the weapon cleaner.
Railguns and their cousins also have the potential to reach much higher muzzle velocities than conventional gunpowder firearms. This means they are more accurate to a larger range. The massively increased speed also means there is no reason to use explosive rounds, as the sheer impact force of a solid metal railgun round would cause as much or more damage than a conventional explosive one. With no gunpowder and no explosive in the round an electromagnetic weapon is much safer to operate or mount as a vehicle, as there is no risk of an ammunition explosion through misfire or enemy attack. Researchers have devised three main types of electromagnetic weapons: railguns, gauss weapons and pulse weapons.
Railguns are the most commonly discussed of electromagnetic accelerators, and work by launching a metal projectile along a pair of electrically charged rails. Each rail carries an electrical current, and as the projectile is loaded into the barrel it touches both and closes an electrical circuit. The electrical current runs up one rail, through the projectile, and down the other rail. This current creates an electromagnetic effect that accelerates the projectile down the barrel at blistering speeds. The combination of the projectile’s high speed, the heat this creates, and the electromagnetic field created by the weapon can actually create a plume of plasma behind the projectile. Some railguns actually use this plasma to help accelerate the projectile further.
Other railgun designs call for additional sets of conductors to channel the electricity and strengthen the magnetic field. Although railguns have many advantages, they also have several flaws, which limits their viability as a battlefield weapon. Like many technologies shown in science fiction, railguns require a large amount of power. The amount of energy required is very difficult to produce in a portable form with current technology, which would be required to bring railguns to the battlefield. Railguns are also very large pieces of technology, and advances will have to be made to make them easily portable. Another problem is that the high temperatures and projectile wear can cause the rails within the weapon to warp, requiring them to be replaced regularly to prevent the weapon from breaking and possible misfiring. Despite these problems railgun research continues. The U.S. Navy created a prototype, which is currently undergoing testing. It is planned to see another five years of improvements before being mounted on combat ships in 2017. While the railgun is being improved the navy also plans to work on mounting large battery and capacitor banks on their ships, and improving the technology behind them, in order to power the new weapon.
Another type of electromagnetic weapon is the gauss weapon, often known as a coil gun. These weapons use the same general principles as railguns, but work in a slightly different way. In a gauss weapon the conductive rails are replaced by electromagnetic coils which the projectile passes between but does not touch. The projectile passes through these coils, which are turned on and off in sequence. The first coil is turned when the weapon is fired, then turned off abruptly as the bullet reaches it while the next coil in line turns on. This system pulls the bullet down the barrel, the opposite of gas from an explosion pushing it out, and then when the last coil is turned off it continues on its path out the barrel of the gun.
In the future it may be possible to create a system where the electromagnetic fields switch polarity after the projectile passes through the coil, pushing and pulling it at the same time. Gauss weapons can have their range and power increased by increasing the number of coils, but this also adds to the complexity, size, and weight of the gun. Gauss weapons require more sophisticated controls than railguns in order to coordinate the magnetic fields, but would use less power as the magnetic coils require less charge than the rails in a railgun. Although gauss weapons do have promise they work only through magnetics, and so a large number of coils are required in order to reach battlefield velocities. This means that gauss weapons can be built smaller than railguns, but in order to cause a great deal of damage would have to be bigger. Research on weaponizing gauss technology continues however, and coilguns are a favourite of hobbyists who enjoy the exciting though dangerous prospect of building a small one themselves. These attempts have grown increasingly sophisticated over the years, and finding videos of homemade coil guns in action is not difficult. Although easily made these devices are very dangerous, due to risks of being electrocuted, as well as hit by a projectile. The U.S. military is focused on railgun research right now, but will likely branch into gauss weapons as electromagnetic weapons become more feasible.
Besides the commonly known rail and gauss weapons there was a third type of electromagnetic accelerator that the United States military experimented with. Although there is very little information the weapon used what was called pulse theory, and used two opposing magnets. Although details are scarce it seems one was secured to the rear of the barrel while the other had a hole in it and was placed at the front. Instead of using traditional metal bullets the pulse weapon would have fired magnets, achieving similar projectile speed as a gauss gun but with less range. Although this project did have some progress it seems to have been scrapped, and very little is known about it.
The primary focus of modern research on electromagnetic acceleration is military, but there are many other possible uses, including faster magnetic trains, launching vehicles or supplies into space, and even using railguns to fire plasma together in the hopes of starting a fusion reaction.Parallels 3.0 - the newest version of the OS X virtualization software - has just been released by SWSOFT.

Anyone who has visited San Francisco's Ferry Building can sense the gravitational force. It's as obvious as the crowds in no hurry to leave or the diagonal grandeur of Market Street rolling down from Twin Peaks.
There is another way the force can be measured, perhaps the most revealing way of all: in the plans and visions for this crossroads that never came to pass.
They were hatched in the decades between the debut of the bay's bridges and the demise of the Embarcadero Freeway, when the landmark that had symbolized San Francisco to outsiders languished as a void without a purpose. It was a void so compelling nonetheless that the powers-that-be tried to fill it again and again, each time without success.
All cities and regions have such layers of what-if, the bullets dodged and the opportunities lost, and it's a mistake to let them fade from memory. There's a clarity in the initial dream that can convey the aspirations and fears of an era more vividly than what eventually was built - and in the process, help us better understand how difficult it is to gauge what our urban future might hold.
Imagine the Ferry Building's clock-topped tower standing erect and alone, its two long wings and their stone arches razed to make room for a vast plaza. Beyond the plaza lies the bay and in it, two new office towers at the end of two new piers.
Now consider this: That official city vision from 1963 marked a step in the right direction.
In 1951, the meeting of Market Street and the Embarcadero was home to a proposed World Trade Center that did away with the Ferry Building altogether and didn't even bother to mention the fact. Instead, the presentation booklet emphasized the importance of a project that would encompass nine square blocks and be "perhaps the most worthwhile major project in the annals of the development of the west."
The oversize booklet included letters of support by everyone from Gov. Earl Warren ("the resources of the state government are pledged to make it a success") to the consul general of Brazil ("the San Francisco World Trade Center will honor greatly the traditions of good taste, tenacity and foresight typical of the men of this city"). A chapter titled "A Preview of Wonderland" described such coming attractions as a restaurant "reminiscent of world-known spots on the Riviera, with modern touches."
The one reminder of what would be lost, subliminally perhaps, was a 30-story tower rising in the center of the nine-block site. It included a clock at its peak, just like the building it would replace.
There's hubris in the dream, a naively destructive belief that blank slates are where you build tomorrow. It's the mind-set of the American Century after World War II: We defeated Germany and Japan, so what lies ahead is the world we choose to make.
That manifest metropolitan destiny remained 12 years later, but reality was clouding the horizon. Instead of a gleaming World Trade Center, San Francisco had the crudely utilitarian Embarcadero Freeway, two decks of concrete severing the Ferry Building from the rest of the city. Plans for other roadways had been stalled by public protest. People were beginning to grasp that progress could cut both ways.
That's the context for the city's 1963 Downtown Plan - an odd document that spells out the need for preservation even as it works with sci-fi glee to remake the northeast corner of San Francisco. The so-called Ferry Tower is restored "to its former importance as an attractive point of interest." At the same time, the wings are removed as part of a larger strategy aimed at "dramatizing and exploiting the meeting of land and water."
By 1968, just five years later, the Ferry Building was seen as worth saving bottom to top, end to end.
In that year's Northern Waterfront Plan, done for the port and the Planning Department, the authors stress that the "important and symbolic" Ferry Building "should be renovated to provide ground-floor arcades, an improved rear facade, and direct pedestrian access through the building from the Embarcadero to the water."
Those words could describe the atmospheric marketplace that exists today. There's also a prescient call for "an attractive transit system" between the Ferry Building and Fisherman's Wharf.
But in the San Francisco of 1968, the northern waterfront remained a working port. Nobody conceived a time when the Embarcadero Freeway might come down. And so the plan framed to the Ferry Building with new commercial buildings to stimulate foot traffic. Instead of historic streetcars rumbling past historic piers, the charmingly retro scene we have today, an elevated "minirail" skimmed the tops of the pier buildings - in part to provide views, in part to avoid hindering the maritime operations below.
Other plans came and went, each one less extravagant than its predecessor. Big moves were replaced by fine-grained interventions, such as the removal of decrepit piers to create parks and promenades.
Then the Loma Prieta earthquake of 1989 led to the removal of the Embarcadero Freeway. The stage was set for the Ferry Building to be reconnected to the larger city.
Ultimately, the unfulfilled plan that feels most familiar was the most modest one of all.
In 1943, with World War II still under way, a "Shoreline Development Preliminary Report" done for the city's master plan identified the post-bridge Ferry Building, "practically deserted," as "a point of great distinction on the waterfront ... no structure in the City has a more important position; no building is remembered by so many."
Rather than tear it down and start anew, the city proposed making it a tourist hub where excursion boats would dock and visitors would find restaurants and shops. Parks would be added along the Embarcadero. On the bay, a "water gate" would welcome everything from motorboats to luxury liners.
This approach was forged in a time of limits, when the city and nation faced an uncertain future. Very different times than today, and yet not so different after all.
That's the value that comes from exploring the shadow landscape, the buildings that never took physical form. Cities are dynamic, unpredictable creations. The ideas cast aside in one era might be relevant down the road. And the most self-assured predictions of what lies ahead, often as not, prove to be a mirage.
1969
Yerba Buena Center
What it is: Kenzo Tange's design for a multi-block zone of visitor facilities.
What happened: San Francisco in 1966 created the Yerba Buena Center Redevelopment District and began demolishing buildings not long after that. This futuristic design was released in 1969, but attorneys seeking to protect the area's low-income residents stalled the plan in court, and this approach was abandoned.
What it suggests: The unbuilt can leave a void that must be filled. This now is the site of Yerba Buena Gardens and its cultural institutions.
1979
Stadium/ballpark
What it is: A combined baseball-football stadium at the mouth of China Basin. This illustration by Christopher Grubbs was done for the city's Planning Department.
What happened: Long before the Giants built their ballpark and the 49ers packed their bags for Santa Clara, the need to replace Candlestick Park was a topic of debate at City Hall. This one looks at the same piece of land where AT&T Park opened in 2000.
What it suggests: A proposal can apparently go nowhere, but plant the seed for something else that bears fruit later.
1985
Crissy Field
What it is: A design by Katsuo Saito and John Northmore Roberts for a park on 45 acres along the bay at what now is Crissy Field.
What happened: When the Presidio was a military base, only its shoreline was controlled by the National Park Service. Private donations for the then-neglected strip were used to hire Saito, then 92 and a revered Japanese landscape architect, to design a garden-like setting that would convey, in Saito's words, "peace of soul and peace among people" and include a small children's lagoon. Before the $7 million project was approved or constructed, the Army decided to close its base at Crissy Field, creating the opportunity for the 130-acre landscape designed by Hargreaves Associates that opened in 2001.
What it suggests: Sometimes it's better to wait.
1990
Freeway fragment
What it is: A 160-foot segment of San Francisco's Embarcadero Freeway, saved as a relic and viewing platform. It's a spiritual predecessor to New York's High Line, above left, a park that opened in 2009 on a railroad viaduct.
What happened: As the city prepared to demolish the double-deck expressway after the Loma Prieta earthquake, architects Byron Kuth and Liz Ranieri sought to keep one section intact. "We just couldn't get traction," Ranieri recalls. "Even our friends thought we were crazy."
What it suggests: Seemingly outlandish ideas can be ahead of their time.

Position: Foreign Service Officer, U.S. Department of State
Best known for: Has played a part in the safety of traveling Americans by disseminating information from the Bureau of Consular Affairs on issues in regions around the world. Consular Affairs is the office responsible for protecting the lives and interests of U.S. citizens abroad, and provides the public with travel advisories and other services. Working as an information officer, McGee, 27, has educated several different groups of travelers through outreach campaigns. This has included providing travel safety information to members of the lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender community; informing professionals in the student exchange world about the bureau’s role in assisting American students in trouble overseas; and helping raise awareness about international abductions of children by their parents. Last year, 1,144 children were abducted from the United States and brought to other countries, with the highest numbers taken to Mexico (416) and the United Kingdom (40).
McGee also provides guidance for State Department press briefings on consular issues, with details on abductions, adoptions, visa matters and, particularly, cases involving American citizens in distress abroad. McGee also serves as a resource for Department of State consular and public affairs officers working both domestically and overseas. His next assignment is in Guatemala City in 2014.
Government service: McGee has held internships with the Congressional Research Service and the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, and has been at the State Department since October.
Motivation for service: As a college student, McGee studied in China for two semesters, first in Beijing and then in Hunan Province in southwest China, learning to speak Mandarin Chinese. The experience heightened his interest in international and public service.
Biggest challenge: Staying on top of the 24-hour news cycle and the real-time reports that come from the public through social media. He also has to be careful to respect the privacy of those who have not given the department permission to release their names or details about their situation, while at the same time trying to provide as much information as possible for public release.
Quote: McGee said he has learned how “intricate the diplomacy process can be and how we take great care here in the State Department in protecting citizens abroad.” He also has come to appreciate “the professionals who conduct diplomacy in some of the most challenging places in the world and the dedication people have.”

The race boasted $14,400 in prize money, with $2,000 going to the overall winner of the race.
Julius Koskei, 29, of Kenya, was the fastest male runner, while Loretta Kilmer, 29, of New York, won in the women’s category.
The race kicked off at 8:30 a.m. at Newport Town Square and passed through the newly opened 4.25-acre Newport Green park.
Entrance fees for the Newport 10K benefited the Jersey City Medical Center, although some runners used the event to raise money for other entities.
Jamie LeFrak, managing partner of the LeFrak Organization that developed Newport, also competed in the race.
“The race was great this year,” said LeFrak, praising the event for putting the Newport community on display and bringing attention to the Jersey City waterfront. “We had a record number of participants.”
In the men’s category, Koskei finished first with a time of 29:15. He was followed by Abiyot Endak, 25, (29:39) and Jeremy Criscione, 24, (29:41).
In the women’s group, Loretta Kilmer finished with a time of 33:53. Hirut Beyene, 19, came in second (33:58), and Malika Mejdoub, 29, finished third (34:06).
Plenty of local runners also participated in the race, including an 11-person team from Jersey City’s Art House Productions. Art House Vice President Lexie Levin said the team ran to raise money for Art House and collected over $1,500.

THE BLADE/JETTA FRASER Enlarge | Buy This Photo
The Bell administration has asked Toledo City Council to extend a contract for $950,000 with two companies to haul away spent lime from its drinking water plant.
Meanwhile, U.S. Rep. Marcy Kaptur (D., Toledo) still awaits an answer to her request to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency to examine the possible impact of depositing and storing the city’s sewage sludge in Facility 3, a man-made, diked-in area that juts into Maumee Bay.
S&L Fertilizer Inc., one of the companies the city hires to haul away the spent lime — a byproduct of the water treatment process — mixes the material with sludge from the city’s sewage-treatment plant and dredge material at Facility 3, and then sells the mixture, which it calls Nu-Soil.
Miss Kaptur sent the U.S. EPA a letter seeking “technical assistance and guidance” after a request from Toledo Councilman D. Michael Collins, who disagrees with using Facility 3 for sludge disposal and storage.
Steve Katich, Miss Kaptur’s chief of staff, said Friday no response had been received.
After seeing the Bell administration’s six-month contract extension request for S&L and the other firm, Stansley Inc., Mr. Collins acknowledged Friday it is necessary to remove the spent lime, but still questioned the sludge storage at Facility 3.
“I realize we have no alternative but to have the spent lime hauled away because it has no value to us,” Mr. Collins said. “But I have trouble with the other part of this.”
Director David Welch, the city’s public utilities director, said the entire requested $950,000 is unlikely to be spent, but he wants authorization for the full amount in case it is needed.
City Council will review the request to extend the contract on Tuesday.
Much of the 500-acre Facility 3 is owned by the Toledo-Lucas County Port Authority. It was built by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers in the 1970s to house contaminated sediment dredged from the Maumee River and Maumee Bay shipping channels — material that continues to be dumped there.
All the sludge created at the city’s sewer plant in North Toledo — about 50,000 tons a year — is taken there by East Toledo’s S&L Fertilizer.
S&L sends Nu-Soil back to the city to use as cover at the Hoffman Road Landfill, but a Blade review of public records earlier this year showed the Nu-Soil was used elsewhere. The Blade’s review also found that the Ohio EPA had not required tracking of where the sludge and dredge-spoil combination is taken.
Mr. Collins said Nu-Soil is not permitted to be used at the Hoffman Road landfill for cover and, instead, tons of the product have been stockpiled at the landfill pending Ohio EPA approval.
S&L was paid $269,548 in 2008 and $210,174 in 2009 for “waste water treatment.” The company was additionally paid $1.9 million in 2008 and $1.1 million in 2009 for “water treatment.”
Nu-Soil has been used as fill at Ravine Park in East Toledo, a retirees’ golf course, and at a private residence on Manhattan Boulevard, city records show. Some is sold to farmers, said Terry Perry, who operates S&L.
For about 12 years, Ohio EPA did not require S&L to track and report where the Nu-Soil went, state EPA Director Scott Nally said in a February, 2012, letter. That changed Dec. 1, when a new Ohio EPA permit required all Class B pathogen-laden sludge be removed from Facility 3 within two years after dumping ceases..

Ever since the snow has com and the temperatures have dropped drastically over here the birds that normally come in flocks such as starlings are coming from their night roosts as a large flock and then splitting up into two's or three's to feed. Then at eventime they rjoin the main flock for the night.
Perhaps they have worked it out that with the scarce food at any one place there wouldn't be enough for the whole flock but enough for a few.
Normally I get anything from 30-50 starlings in my garden now only 3 or 4 at a time.
House sparrows are also doing the same. Perhaps one of you wise persons may have a logical answer to this event.
Keep Feeding the birds.
Sussexman.
The picture on the left is of my cat scarer.Chance
BUT, I do see them flocking up hugely before bad storms.
I think you're right about the feeding grounds idea.
Chance is beautiful! :star:
My collie didn't like cats either, but didn't know what to do with the ferrets, so when they nipped her hocks, she'd sit on them with this woeful look! Is Chance male or female, and who's idea is what looks like a rubber chicken?
Chance is a male Rough Collie, he will be 13 years old on 25/01/2010. We have had him since he was 5, he is a rescue dog. His father was Best in show at Cruffts in 1996 and Chance has a pedigree as long as your arm. But we didn't know that till after we had adopted him. He is a real beauty and so good natured. His previous owner was an elderly lady who lived with her chidren and because Chance was unable to accept babies she had to let him go. We are in contact with her and every Christmas send her a card from Chance telling her what he has been up to and photos.When we first got him he was so nervous that he wouldn't get in the back seat of my saloon. So don't laugh but I gave the saloon away and bought an estate, he hops up in the back easy. So the dog cost me £80 but the estate £8000. But only other solution was to take him back and that was never going to happen.
Now the rubber toy was his Xmas pressy from my daughter. It is a female turkey, dressed in a dress (with cleavage) and a red christmas hat. And it squeaks. Chance has a toy box full of squeaky toys. Is he spoilt, not a 'chance'.
I hope I haven't sent you to sleep with all this but he is really a great pal to me.
Sussexman
It's a great story Colin, not a bore at all!
I should've known it was a squeak toy with a name!
I too got mine Carli as a rescue (from beating & neglect) and also had a good pedigree but not a grand one like Chance's. And I perfectly understand the change of vehicle.
I broke down one day with Carli in the back of my VW bug, we'd hit a bit of oil on a just starting rainy road, spun off the side into a flat puddle! 4th gear of course stuck. So luckily I had to walk about 1/4 mile up the road to Eagle Towing. The tow was due to be back soon, so they invited me in for a cup of coffee. I was soon surrounded by collies ... all related to mine! The mother collie always had large litters, and Carli was last at 13. Finally the tow guy made it home, we hopped in, and all he had to due was give me nudge so I could shift the gears ... and he didn't charge me, but I tipped $10.
And Carli was still guarding the back seat. :love:
It's sweet of you to send a Christmas card like that, I'm sure it's very appreciated.:santa:

Designed with its namesake’s rough & tumble (but often quite warm) conditions in mind, Alpinestars’ Moab is a lightweight glove for more aggressive trail and XC riding. Strategically-placed padding should help to protect the outside knuckles and fingers from trailside branches while the long foam/mesh cuff and substantial closure are designed to lend some extra support and shock absorption to the wrist. Hit the jump for more photos…
It’s still early (and relatively cool) here, so we don’t have a ton of time in the Moabs yet- but so far don’t have any complaints. There is a large (if unusually placed) terry wipe at the back of the hand and the double-layer palm is comfortable for several hours at a go.
The Moabs look baggier in the photos than they feel- but if you’re between sizes it would probably be best to size down. Our early-production sample had some incomplete bonding on the wrist closure- but that’s something that will be replaced free of charge if found at retail. With a bit of extra protection and plenty of ventilation, we’re looking forward to having the $45 Alpinestars along for some technical summer adventures.
More after a few months…

Not to hate, BUT “will be replaced free of charge if found at retail” on the mfgring defect is super shoddy. I’ve run Astar’s and they are fine gloves but seriously $45 retail. I always feel fortunate to not have to pay retail prices for marketing costs when I read these MSRP’s in print.
Why wont someone… ANYONE!… Use reflective Materials on the Backs of their Gloves?The U.S. Forest Service is putting the finishing touches on a massive, 37,500-acre thinning plan all the way from Tonto Creek to Star Valley.
The dramatic thinning of the overgrown forest would protect the most endangered communities in Rim Country — the settlements of Kohl’s Ranch, Christopher Creek and Tonto Village, nestled now in thick forest.
Moreover, thinning the 800 to 1,500 trees per acre down to densities closer to 50 to 80 trees per acre will protect Star Valley and Payson from fires roaring out of the forest to the east, planners said.
The 37,500-acre project area includes roughly 1,100 acres of private land, much of it in about 10 enclaves, all surrounded by thick, overgrown, fire-prone forest. The project area is about 10 miles across and 8 miles wide, with the Control Road and Highway 260 running through the middle of the rugged terrain.
The comment period for the Myrtle Wildland Urban Interface project’s combination of controlled burns and hand thinning closed this week, but it could take a decade of scrimping, saving and lucky grant writing to come up with the millions of dollars needed to complete the project.
The interlocking projects under the Rim and north of Highway 260 will complete the most urgent projects in Rim Country, officials said. In the past five years, the Forest Service has thinned tens of thousands of acres to create fire buffer zones around Pine, Strawberry and Payson.
Tonto National Forest fire planners from the Payson Ranger District will compile input received during the public comment comment period before coming up with the final plan.
The draft plan included some controversial elements.
The plan calls for cutting down almost all white fir, Douglas fir and ponderosa pine less than 18 inches in diameter at chest height.
Forest advocates have often pushed for rules that would spare trees 16 inches in diameter or even 14 inches in diameter, arguing that a healthy forest needs an adequate supply of such large trees. Such large trees typically have their lowest branches beyond the reach of ground fires, which means a forest dominated by such trees would resist fires and even benefit from the periodic, low-intensity ground fires to which the forest is naturally adapted.
However, including the larger trees on which the timber companies that do the thinning can make a profit, can offset the cost of the project.
The proposed rules would also remove all dead pines up to 18 inches in diameter. Several studies have reported large dead snags and even downed logs are the focal point for a majority of the insect and wildlife activity in the deep forest.
The draft rules would remove all live and dead Arizona white oak and Emory oak less than 10 inches in diameter in the project area. In addition, thinning crews would remove all juniper up to 20 inches in diameter and all the brush.
The draft rules would spare all trees above those limits, even if it would result in areas with more than the target 80 trees per acre. In addition, crews would leave smaller trees where necessary to keep densities from falling below about 50 trees per acre.
The rules would spare any pinyon pines as well as any hardwood trees in riparian areas.
Those rules would apply mostly in the 4,447 acres earmarked for hand thinning, mostly areas too close to houses to risk the use of controlled burns. In those areas, crews would use chain saws to thin the forest, pile up the cut trees in massive slash piles, then burn those piles by hand once they’d dried out.
Crews would do less thinning on another 12,000 acres, before setting controlled fires during cool, wet times of the year to burn off the slash and additional underbrush. The partial hand thinning would in theory keep the prescribed fire from climbing up into the remaining trees and getting out of control.
Generally these “thin from below” areas would abut the hand-thinned areas and run along both sides of the highway.
The plan also calls for simply setting fire to about 10,000 acres, after first creating fire breaks and buffer zones to keep the fire contained.
Such “prescribed fire” areas would generally burn on the steepening slopes north of the Control Road, but under the Rim. Crews would use existing fire breaks and Forest Road 300 up on top of the Rim to keep those fires from spreading out of control.
Forest managers hope to use the combination of hand thinning and controlled burns to create a more natural mosaic of shaded forest stretches, meadows, open areas and protected stream sides.
Some research suggests that regular, low-intensity ground fires created just such a ecological patchwork before a century of grazing, logging and fire suppression resulted in a dramatic and dangerous increase in tree densities.
However, preparing an overall plan for such a large area, with a wealth of wildlife, in-holdings and riparian areas, could prove challenging. Endangered species like Mexican Spotted Owls, Mexican Garter Snakes, Chiricahua Leopard Frogs and many others each have sometimes conflicting habitat needs.
However, the Tonto forest has proved adept at completing the master plans for such controlled burns and then snatching federal grants as they become available. Often, the Forest Service comes up with year-end money for thinning projects to protect forest communities, for which only forests that have completed all the preliminary work can compete.
In addition, Tonto National Forest lucked out this year in snagging millions of dollars in federal stimulus grants to thin thousands of acres.

Mercury Grand Marquis Replacement Oxygen Sensor Information
The Mercury Grand Marquis oxygen sensor monitors the amount of burned gases in the exhaust system. Depending on the year and model of your Mercury Grand Marquis, the oxygen sensor is usually located on the header pipe. It tells whether the fuel mixture in your engine contains too much fuel (rich) or too much air/oxygen (lean). The electronic fuel injector sensor will then tell your vehicle to adjust the mixture according to the conditions which change according to variables such as altitude and ambient temperature of the environment. As the vehicle travels higher in altitude, there is less oxygen available and will need to provide less fuel and needs to compensate one way or another. If the CO2 sensor malfunctions, it can dump fuel and begin smoking black smoke from the tailpipe indicating that there may be too much fuel and not enough air. Removing the oxygen sensor is done simply and quickly. Generally it is visible on the exhaust header and can be easily removed with an open-end or box wrench. Unplug the old CO2 sensor first. This is important because the wire twists along with it and could twist right out of the sensor, then just screw in the new one and plug in the wire.

Hot peppers add a lot of flavor to our food, but they may be doing much more than just making our eyes water. New research shows they might have tumor-fighting benefits, as well. Here are a few reasons you should consider adding some spice into your diet.
It may reduce risk for tumors
A new study in mice published in the journal The Journal of Clinical Investigation found that the spicy chemical in peppers, capsaicin, can activate cell receptors in the intestinal lining, thereby creating a reaction that reduces the risk of developing tumors. The researchers suggest that capsaicin, which is also used as a analgesic by exhausting nerves so they cannot report pain, could help turn off an over-reactive receptor that might spur tumor growth. They fed capsaicin to mice genetically prone to develop more tumors and found that the capsaicin reduced tumors and extended the lives of those mice, especially when they were also given an anti-inflammatory drug. The findings are very new and haven’t be replicated, but it could be another win for spicy food lovers down the line.
It improves your sex life
Now, there’s some debate over how effective natural aphrodisiacs really are, but hey, if you’re not interested in trying pharmaceutical libido boosters, why not give more flavorful food a try. A review of research published in the journal Food Research International in 2011 found ginseng and saffron booth boosted sexual performance. What’s unknown are what the most effective doses are, and how it’s best to consume them. But adding a pinch here or there won’t hurt.
It helps with weight loss
Research has shown that spicy food can increase satiety, but researchers at the University of California, Los Angeles, Center for Human Nutrition have also shown that peppers might actually encourage your body to burn more calories. In a small study of men and women, those who were taking pills with pepper components over one month were shown to burn more fat than those taking a placebo. Other researchers at Purdue University found that eating less than a teaspoon of dried cayenne red pepper lowered appetite and increased calorie burn.
While the science isn’t bulletproof, it’s growing, and provides a simple way for eaters to give themselves an edge. Not to mention the numbers show that consumers are eating more spicy food anyway. A 2014 food industry report found that 54% of consumers say hot or spicy foods are appealing compared to 46% in 2009. And, younger diners between ages 18 and 34 are the most likely to order something spicy off the menu.Profile of IWPR Board Member, Holly Fechner.
Holly Fechner has received a first-class Washington education. Having spent eight years in the late Sen. Edward Kennedy’s (D-Mass.) employ, Fechner was a key cog in the Senate legend’s machine that kept the upper chamber in motion, churning out bill after bill.
That time — as policy director for Kennedy, as well as his chief labor and pensions counsel for the Senate Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee — has led to Fechner helping run one of the best law firm lobby practices in town at Covington & Burling.Fechner said she saw how one of the true greats would work lawmakers, garner support and close the deal.
“He was the master. He was really the master,” Fechner told The Hill.
She described how Kennedy would work constantly to win support for his causes, including many she worked on, such as raising the minimum wage and reforming the pension system. Fechner, 49, noted how the liberal lion would carry a list of all the senators he needed to talk to for different issues and take every opportunity to give a Senate floor speech.
“It was always so fun, because often the chamber was very empty,” Fechner said. “That didn’t make any difference to him. He was speaking, certainly, to the broader audience out in the country, but also I loved seeing all the pages come in and sit down and watch him give a speech. … A lot of times, by the end of it, he was drenched in sweat, because he just would throw his whole self into it.”
After leaving Capitol Hill in February 2007, Fechner came to Covington and is now co-chairwoman of the firm’s government affairs practice group. The practice draws on the giant law firm’s expertise across several issue areas, having 36 registered lobbyists.
Representing clients via traditional lobbying as well as in more arcane regulatory and legal work in Washington has worked well for Covington. The firm posted solid revenue in lobbying fees for 2011, taking in $11.2 million. That’s a 10 percent jump from 2010, while many on K Street saw their lobbying earnings plateau or fall last year.
Covington’s clients include many big-name corporations — such as Amazon, Microsoft and Qualcomm — and well-known brands like the National Football League, according to lobbying disclosure records..
Fechner has earned a reputation in Washington for working hard and being well-prepared— attributes that were honed as a Kennedy aide.
Tamera Luzzatto, a former chief of staff to Sen. Jay Rockefeller (D-W.Va.) and then-Sen. Hillary Rodham Clinton (D-N.Y.), remembers seeing Fechner sitting on the staff couches just behind Kennedy’s desk in the Senate chamber. Fechner would be assisting Kennedy with his speeches, often on a Friday afternoon, helping him articulate his issues when everybody else wanted to go home.
“There was Holly, with her stacks and her charts and her talking points,” Luzzatto said. “He was a machine and she was a big part of his machine. You could almost say that in the Senate, she was one of the best engines for that machine.”
Luzzatto, now managing director of government relations at the Pew Charitable Trusts, said Fechner would know whatever issue she was working on “absolutely cold,” which won respect from Republicans, too.
“Sen. Kennedy would be launching mortar rounds from the Senate floor at us, and Holly would be on the phone, calmly and constructively expressing their concerns and suggesting a pathway forward,” said Steven Law, once a deputy secretary at the Labor Department during the Bush administration. “Overall, we actually had a great relationship with Chairman Kennedy, and Holly was the key to that.”
Law, now president and CEO of American Crossroads,.”
In 1991, Fechner, now married with one child, first came to work in Washington on a fellowship at the National Partnership for Women and Families. The Oberlin College graduate worked on the Family and Medical Leave Act and the Civil Rights Act of 1991.
“It was amazing to come to D.C. and be involved with legislation that was historic and happening right before my eyes,” Fechner said.
She would later enter private law practice and do stints at the Labor Department during the Clinton administration and as legislative counsel for the AFL-CIO.
Working at the nation’s largest labor federation “was a great education for me in the business of lobbying,” Fechner said.
“They are shoe-leather lobbyists. I learned a lot about a huge array of House and Senate offices. We went door to door a lot, sort of your old-fashioned version of lobbying, and learned a lot of the back-stories on so many of the members and what was significant in terms of getting the kind of vote count we needed on different issues,” Fechner said.
Fechner left the AFL-CIO to join Kennedy’s staff on Capitol Hill. One of her many assignments was helping to arrange expert briefings for the senator, including those that would lead to the healthcare reform law.
Fechner is now working on the law’s many regulations for clients. She said agencies are not backing off despite the uncertainty from the looming Supreme Court decision that could overturn it.
“I think people thought more would be on hold, but I really do see the regulatory agencies moving full steam ahead. I think it’s because they really don’t have any choice,” Fechner said. “I think they will be ready no matter what happens with the Supreme Court.”Thanks! Why are you flagging this item?

As Flynt pointed out, sex is the last thing on people's minds with the American economy gone limp. He and Francis noted that DVD sales are flaccid, down 22% from this time last year. These figures correspond closely with a 24% decrease in sperm bank deposits indicated by falling poll numbers.
Unable to fulfill the National Sperm Bank's appeal earlier this week for massive emergency sperm deposits, Congress initially denied their request. However, in light of this newest request by Flynt and Francis, representative Barney Frank has come up with a creative solution that should benefit all parties involved, including Congress itself.
A tentative agreement reached this Thursday calls for a $1 billion injection into the porn industry, far less than the original amount requested, but a substantial sum nevertheless. In return, Flynt and Francis must supply all male members of the House of Representatives and Senate with examples of their best material on DVD. From there, Congress said it will "take things in hand," promising National Sperm Bank CEO Rod Cummings that they will now be able to make all necessary deposits to keep the bank afloat.
"I find it encouraging that we were able to organize this 3-way... um, agreement," said Flynt. "Hopefully we'll see a growth spurt coming to the economy very soon."I’ve got another long quantitative model post coming soon, but in the meantime, I want to post more pictures from Chile. At the end of the last post, we were re-moistened and across the river about halfway up this valley:
We spent a day hiking up to the edge of the big lake, emptied our packs, hiked back to where we had camped to fill up our packs with the rest of our stuff, and hiked back to the lake. Now that we were all together and on our way, the massive pile of stuff required hiking from point A to point B, returning to A with empty packs, and then retracing our steps to B with the rest of our stuff. This was made all the more difficult by the irregular and often steep terrain and the exceptionally robust temperate rainforest foliage in and around the valley.
Here’s a view of the big lake, which had a number of fairly massive icebergs floating around in it (click to embiggen):
At one point during this day, we stopped for a break, and a horsefly larger than any I had ever seen paid us a visit. I swatted it, and it fell to the rocky ground stunned. I picked up a softball sized rock and dropped it directly on the fly. The fly seemed, at most, slightly peeved by this. I had to drop the rock on the fly maybe five or six more times before it stopped moving. It was an impressively durable insect.
We had to make another river crossing somewhere up near the lakes. It wasn’t anywhere near as difficult as the roped crossing we made downstream, but it was still reasonably treacherous. After camping for another day, we made our way around the north side of the small lake and hiked up toward the glacier. Here’s a close-up (a screen grab from google earth) of the small lake and the glacier:
I remember that, as we talked about ascending from the lake to the glacier, it didn’t look like it would be much of a climb. One of the instructors pointed out that, because our eyes are displaced horizontally with respect to one another, it’s difficult to judge the steepness of inclines when your head is upright. We all dutifully turned our heads sideways and saw immediately that the incline was much steeper than we had thought. It’s not like we had a choice about where to go, of course, but now we could more appropriately fear the hike ahead. From somewhere up that incline, between the lake and the glacier, I took this picture:
So, it turns out that glaciers are really impressive things. We camped for a few days on the rocks next to the glacier, spending some time learning to use crampons and scouting out how best to actually ascend the glacier. I’ll leave off with a couple pictures from around this time in the course. Note, please, that the wee wrinkles in the screen grab picture are the 10 to 40 foot tall walls of ice in these pictures:

At Pennsylvania State University, more than 80 students are pursuing a slightly more noble goal: landing a spacecraft on the moon, and hopefully earning $30 million in the process. The Lunar Lion team is competing in the Google Lunar X Prize, which challenges private teams to land on the moon and then move their craft to a second location at least 500 meters away by the end of 2015.
Lunar Lion director Michael Paul, a former NASA spacecraft systems engineer, said the university asked him to look into opportunities to become more involved in space exploration. Three years ago, he was OK’d to pursue the X Prize.
“I’ve really fallen in love with the idea of building these robots and using them as our eyes and ears around the solar system,” Paul said. “The X Prize stood out as the best way to make a mark on the industry.”
But when you are a student oriented team competing against 33 (now 18) private and national teams, unique challenges emerge. Money is tighter, and turnover is high.
The team began by investigating the most realistic, affordable option to get a lander to the moon.
“One aspect of space systems engineering that is perhaps a little foreign to the average person is the frugality of the engineering,” Paul said. “You don’t send anything up on a launch vehicle that you don’t need to send. You can’t afford it. As you go through the design for any spacecraft for any mission, you repeatedly ask yourself, ‘Do we really need to do this?'”
One of the major places that mindset came into play for the Lunar Lions was determining how their lander would move 500 meters once it reached the moon. Instead of wheels, they settled on a “hop” system where the lander takes off and lands again. It’s less expensive and doesn’t require a rover or totally new mode of transit to be built into the lander.
As far as turnover goes, Paul said the team is organizing itself to ensure there is continuity as underclassmen replace graduating upperclassmen. In the process, they are hoping to spread that STEM careers can be exciting.
“We want it to be what it was after Apollo,” director of development Steve Blake said. “People went to school so that they could build rocket ships. People went to school so that they could put something on the moon.”
The team launched a crowdfunding campaign today meant to pay for an essential next step in their quest for the moon. They want to raise $400,000 before February 24 to finalize and build their engine, test that the lander can execute its hop, pay for test site fees and materials and compensate students, faculty and engineers for their time. More crowdfunding campaigns are planned.
“The last space X Prize was fantastic in its own way, but they really put the bar high on this one. It requires a whole lot more infrastructure, complexity,” Paul said. “This is hard. This is rocket science.”The transition from youth to adulthood is a challenge for nearly all adolescents. It’s a time period riddled with changes, challenges and difficult choices that influence the trajectory of the rest of their lives. In fact, the choices youth make regarding education, family formation and employment can affect their likelihood of becoming productive, self-sufficient adults . This transition is particularly difficult for particular groups of youth, including those who lack family support and resources, have grown up in deep poverty, have learning disabilities or mental health problems, or have been exposed to violence or abuse in childhood.
In 2009, the Office of Planning, Research and Evaluation (OPRE) within the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services’ Administration for Children and Families (ACF) launched the Youth Demonstration Development Project (YDD) to systematically review the current field of research on youth development and successful transition to adulthood. Mathematica Policy Research and Chapin Hall at the University of Chicago conducted the study.
YDD’s primary objective was to develop an evidence-informed conceptual framework that could be applied to existing or new ACF programs to improve the well-being of at-risk youth, and increase their ability to become self-sufficient adults and avoid long-term reliance on public assistance.
The YDD project, which concluded in March 2013, resulted in several research products:
Advancing the Self-Sufficiency and Well-Being of At-Risk Youth
A Conceptual Framework: How can programs advance the self-sufficiency and well-being of at-risk youth? This research report attempts to answer this important question by presenting a research-based framework for efforts to help at-risk youth enter a career workforce trajectory and prepare to become well-functioning, self-sufficient adults. The framework presented is particularly relevant for youth who are or could be served by ACF programs—especially homeless youth, youth in the foster care system, and teen parents. The framework suggests the possibility of using evidence-informed interventions to address two primary areas: youths’ resilience and human capital development. It suggests finding tailored solutions grounded in a trusting relationship between youth and program staff to help move youth toward both healthy functioning and economic self-sufficiency as they transition to adulthood.
Framework for Advancing the Well-being and Self-Sufficiency of At-Risk Youth
How can programs advance the well-being and self-sufficiency of at-risk youth? This issue brief summarizes a research-based framework for efforts to help at-risk youth enter a career workforce trajectory and prepare to become well-functioning, self-sufficient adults.
Connecting At-Risk Youth to Promising Occupations
Promising occupations for at-risk youth provide sufficient compensation and could put them on a path to becoming independent adults. To identify promising occupations, this issue brief examines four key features: 1) median earnings level, 2) education and training pre-requisites, 3) projected growth in labor-market demand, and 4) potential for individual advancement. Based on these criteria, opportunities in two fields are highlighted – health care and construction. A number of work-based learning and career pathway programs are also discussed, including ACF’s Health Profession Opportunity Grants program.
The Economic Well-Being of Lesbian, Gay, and Bisexual Youth Transitioning Out of Foster Care
This issue brief describes the characteristics and economic well-being of young people aging out of foster care who identify themselves as lesbian, gay, or bisexual (LGB). It also compares their economic self-sufficiency.
Synthesis of Research and Resources to Support at-Risk Youth
This research report provides a synthesis of research and existing ACF resources for serving at-risk youth. It describes what we know from research about at-risk youth, and how at-risk youth are currently being served by both ACF and non-ACF programs that have been shown to put youth on a path toward self-sufficiency. The report identifies issues to consider in creating conceptual frameworks for developing and enhancing ACF programs that can or do serve at-risk youth.

Most nights are OK with advance notice. Downtown Chicago is best for me.
Hearts, spades, and bridge are my 3 top choices, with poker a distant 4th. Bridge is actually my favorite (I often travel to play in bridge tournaments all over the country), but I love all 3 games. If anyone is interested in getting together for some informal hearts or spades games, in addition to our official meetups, I'd be happy to host, especially on weekends (I have a good card table, a convenient downtown location for which I can provide inexpensive parking, etc.).
1. Playing sports, especially golf, racquetball, tennis & volleyball. 2. Playing board games that involve strategy or skill: e.g., Taboo, Scrabble, chess, Settlers of Catan, Dune, etc. 3. Dining out, especially if accompanied by a spirited conversation or debate. 4. Watching sports, especially football and baskeball (go Bulls and Bears!!). 5. Almost anything that involves an intellectual challenge!
I love playing cards with good players. When not playing cards, I work as an attorney (started my own law firm a few years ago).

SAN FRANCISCO, May 1, 2013 /PRNewswire/ -- In honor of Asian Pacific American Heritage Month in May, PG&E and its InspirAsian Employee Resource Group (ERG) and Samahan ERG will celebrate this special occasion with Asian and Pacific Islander communities in Northern and Central California.
"We are proud to celebrate the diversity, rich culture and contributions of the Asian and Pacific Islander communities," said Jane Yura, vice president of standards and policies for gas operations at PG&E, a longtime supporter of the utility's ERGs. "Having a broad and diverse employee base at PG&E reinforces our commitment to the communities where we live and work, and helps us to provide safe, reliable and affordable gas and electric service to our diverse customers."
PG&E has served and engaged with California's Asian and Pacific Islander communities for more than 100 years. They, in turn, have played a major role in determining how the utility delivers services to its customers. Through advertising in Asian language media, appearing at regional cultural events and working with local groups, the utility shares important information on safety, cost saving and financial assistance with the diverse communities.
The direct outreach not only helps critical material reach insular members of the community, it also provides economic benefits to a range of Asian owned businesses and organizations. PG&E recently announced that it achieved an all-time high of over $2 billion in spending with diverse suppliers in 2012, accounting for 38.8 percent of its total procurement budget. PG&E's total spending on Asian-owned business enterprises also reached an all-time high of $290 million, an increase of $71 million or 32.6 percent over 2011.
At PG&E, nearly 15 percent of employees have identified themselves as Asian, native Hawaiian or Pacific Islander. PG&E established Samahan ERG (formerly known as Filipino Employees Association) in 1971 and InspirAsian ERG (formerly known as Asian Employees Association) in 1984. Both ERGs aim to enhance an inclusive culture within PG&E, offer career development to its members, provide community support and award scholarships to stellar students. More than 1,000 employees joined the groups, which are open to all employees regardless of their ethnic background.
These efforts reflect PG&E's longstanding commitment to reach its diverse customers in the communities where they work and live.At a whopping 4,293 words, Chuck Philips’ guest blog in The Village Voice was a lengthy read to say the least.

Good designs last, evolutionists conclude, but where did they come from in the first place?
Why is the number of vertebrae in the trunk of mammals, despite diverse lifestyles, “surprisingly constant”?1 Evolutionary biologists investigating biodiversity want to know.
To solve this riddle, Frietson Galis of Leiden’s Naturalis Biodiversity Center and colleagues examined the skeletons of 90 different mammalian species—774 specimens housed at 9 different natural history museums—assessing how much the shape and number of vertebrae in each section of the back varied. They found that there is minimal variation among fast, agile mammals, even up to the family level. Slower mammals are less consistent.
Here are two of the 90 species of mammals recently surveyed in an effort to explain the consistency of mammalian vertebral design. Fast, agile animals like the gazelle (top) and the predators that chase it have backs built for flexibility thanks to the long lumbar region. Slower running mammals that do not rely on speed for survival, like the elephant (bottom), have longer thoracic cavities and shorter lumbar regions. The vertebral shapes in fast mammals are also intricately optimized for flexibility, differing from the shapes found in slower mammals. Image: Joris van Alphen through Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences (2014) doi: 10.1073/pnas.1401392111
Mammals that depend on speed and agility for survival—whether carnivores or the animals they chase—have vertebral columns optimized for flexibility. A greater proportion of their vertebrae are apportioned to the more flexible part of the back than in slow mammals.2 Those great evolutionary constructs resist further change, researchers say. In short, once upon a time evolution stumbled on speedy designs, vertebral plans that produced such fast, agile animals that natural selection prevented further random tinkering with their anatomy.
Researchers also learned that in families of slow mammals for which speed is not critical, spinal flexibility seems to be less important. Those animals are more likely to vary a bit, exhibiting variations that increase stiffness, yet those variations persist. Animals that have long been domesticated or crossbred, thus obviating the effects of natural selection based on survival, also vary more in the number of spinal vertebrae allotted to the more flexible trunk.
“The stiffness of the back of a mammal is key to whether evolutionary change is possible or not,” explains Frietson Galis. “The locomotion of slow mammals with a stiff back is only marginally affected by irregular lumbosacral joints, but for fast running mammals such joints are fatal,” adds coauthor Clara ten Broek.
Anatomy and biomechanical functionality are related. Ribs are attached to thoracic vertebrae, and this stiffens the upper back a bit. Sacral vertebra are fused together, producing a stiff region at the bottom. Thus an animal’s flexibility hinges on the total number of presacral vertebra and especially on the number of lumbar vertebrae—the vertebrae above the fused sacral bones and below the bones whose mobility is restricted by ribs. Therefore, anatomical designs that assign more vertebrae to the lumbar region are more flexible than arrangements with a large chest and a short lower back.
Comparison of the skeletons of fast, slow, wild, and domesticated mammals confirms these biomechanics. The fastest mammals—like cheetahs and gazelles—have a smaller proportion of their vertebral columns associated with the chest and a longer section apportioned to lumbar vertebrae. The number and the specific shapes of these lumbar vertebrae optimize flexibility in multiple dimensions, allowing for strength even when twisting as the animals gallop or bound along at high speed. Within each fast family of mammals, the vertebral design is remarkably constant.
Within families and even individual species of slower mammals—like elephants and badgers and pigs—the number of vertebrae apportioned to the flexible lumbar region vary. Those variations are typically in the form of an increased allotment of vertebrae to the lumbosacral region, where the bones may be at least partially fused. Thus, the variations that occur are changes that decrease flexibility. Such stiff-backed variations occur with some regularity among mammals not built for speed.
Stiffer-backed variants also occur more among domesticated animals—like dogs, cats, and horses—than in their faster and more agile wild counterparts. “Human care relaxes selection by increasing the survival of less adapted individuals,” the authors write. “Inbreeding probably also plays a role, as inbred wild wolves have higher numbers of transitional lumbosacral vertebrae than out-bred ones.”1
This study confirms the principles of natural selection within each animal family. Animals whose lifestyles in the present world make them depend upon speed for survival tend to maintain a skeletal structure that optimizes their speed. Flexibility-limiting variations can develop in populations of animals whose survival does not depend on their ability to run down their dinner or to flee from faster animals.
Survival-of-the-fittest, the necessity of running fast to live—or to eat—is a by-product of the suffering and death that entered the world after Adam’s sin.
Yet none of this has anything to do with a molecules-to-man kind of evolution. None of this demonstrates how various kinds of vertebral body plans could evolve from a common mammalian ancestor. Natural selection, an observable phenomenon, does not supply the novel genetic information to produce newer more complex kinds on animals but only affects the variations within the population of each kind of animal. Domesticated animals are less likely to be affected by natural selection, as human management and artificial selection favor survival of animals that might be otherwise weeded out. But they only vary within their created kinds and certainly do not embark on a path of upward evolutionary complexity.
Biological observations confirm that animals reproduce and vary within their created kinds. The researchers found that the degree of variation was consistent within each sort of animal “at the family level.” Biblical creationists regularly point out that our modern categories—like phylum, family, genus, and species—most nearly reflect the “created kinds” of Genesis at the family level. Representatives of each kind of air-breathing land animals were preserved with Noah’s family on the Ark about 4,350 years ago, and from those kinds of animals the biodiversity we see today has developed. Not only do the findings of the study reflect the principles of natural selection within each family of animals but also they show how our Common Designer—our Creator, God—used similar designs in many kinds of animals, with engineering nuances of vertebral shapes and proportions that best support the functional needs of each animal’s lifestyle both before man’s disobedience and the Curse caused sin and death and afterward.
The Creator God of the Bible is a wise engineer and a grand designer. God has told us the truth about our origins and the origins of the animals in the Bible, as well as the truth about our sinful nature and about how the rebellion of Adam led to the suffering and death we see in the world. Survival-of-the-fittest, the necessity of running fast to live—or to eat—is a by-product of the suffering and death that entered the world after Adam’s sin.
As we marvel at God’s designs that optimize each kind of animal for the niche it occupies in this world, we should give thought to the sin guilt we all bear.

A Reality Show Well Worth the Time
By Chuck Jaffee
Editor’s note: Intended first as a movie review of “How the Kids Saved the Parks,” showing at the Wild and Scenic Film Festival (January 10-13), this expanded into sharing more of what a fine bunch of kids and teachers have to say.
What is an activist? Looking for an expert definition, consider what Alexandra Zetterberg has to say: “People come together and put their thoughts into actions. It is people standing up for what they believe in, and not backing down. Activism can be used for big and small things.”
Zetterberg, a fifth grader at the Grass Valley Charter School, is a veteran of a successful campaign that helped stop the closure of South Yuba River State Park. Dozens of kids from the school helped enliven a larger community effort.
“We got as many people as we could.” Alexandra also commented. “Then we organized. We put a Mobile Media Action Team together. We got to have an audience with [California Secretary for Natural Resources] John Laird’s office. We explained our reason why we didn’t think the parks should close. In the end they gave in to our wishes and we came away triumphant because we pulled together and made a difference.”
Another fifth grader, Sammy Maliszewski, flavors commentary with a twist on preteen sophistication, “The community showed activism too. It’s a cooperative thing. We are Charter kids. Grownups don’t expect a lot out of kids, but that’s the thing. Kids like us are made for stopping the grownups from becoming bad guys when they don’t know it.”
Teacher Merry Byles-Daly answered a question asking what surprised her most about an opportunity for the kids to present their concerns at the state capitol. “With just a couple of days’ notice, over 40 students showed up, full of passionate enthusiasm for saving their park. What impressed me the most, at that first meeting, was the level at which the students understood what was at stake, and what it would take from them to be prepared to present their case in a very high level and public setting.”
Third grader Ben Meyler noted, “I was surprised at how nice they were at the state capitol, and they listened to us.”
Teacher Alex Ezzell shared something he learned about these young activists. “These students reminded me about something that I believe all of us once knew. There is tremendous power in the enthusiasm of youth. It has nothing to do with ‘cuteness’ and everything to do with the purity of their beliefs. Cynicism has not yet crept into their outlook. They wholeheartedly believe, that despite inevitable obstacles and setbacks, with perseverance, they will succeed. It’s as though, through their belief and commitment to action, the only possible outcome is success.”
OK, maybe there is room for a little cuteness. Fifth grader Claire Schad offered an analogy that deserves a place in the activist handbook: “I play softball, and if you hit the ball right to the second baseman, who is going to throw it to first, you don’t stop till you are at the base. They could still drop it.”
Alex Ezzell nods appreciatively, as do his students, to the thousands of people who lent support. This includes help from the Nevada County Board of Supervisors, the mayors of Nevada City and Grass Valley, and from non-profits, such as the South Yuba River Citizens League (SYRCL). He hailed the “gift of trust and responsibility” instilled in a group of students amidst “an amazing tapestry of organizations and individuals [that] coalesced to make this action successful.”
SYRCL, which orchestrates the Wild & Scenic Film Festival, produced the 15-minute “How the Kids Saved the Parks.” It well deserves being one of the diverse dozens of films accepted in the festival from all over the US and countries around the world.
The film’s local color not only fits perfectly with SYRCL’s decades-long devotion to the South Yuba River. Its exemplary success story nestles into a core theme of the film festival – activism. With a solid reporting style, this right-sized, well-constructed documentary puts the kids front and center. By their example they inspire grownups to do what Sammy Maliszewski thinks activism is: “compassion, perseverance, and courage.”Zack Kopplin, the former high school student (now at Rice University), worked tirelessly to repeal the wrongly-named “Louisiana Science Education Act” — a bill which actually “encourages the state’s science teachers to miseducate their students about the scientific standing of evolution and climate change.”
Even though his work didn’t lead to a repeal, he’s now at least getting recognized for his efforts. He’s one of four recipients of the Hugh M. Hefner First Amendment Award:

… and a trip to the Playboy Mansion for the reception. (For Science!)

This project aligned well with my own research of using Web data (when possible) to investigate collaboration in science, as the group of researchers related to the project are all working on different aspects of tracing Web behaviors. The project includes a number of computer scientists interested in implementing Semantic Web techniques and a group of social scientists who are working to analyze traceable Web behaviors to understand a combination of mechanisms within science from structures of science (publication practices), to understanding the dynamics of online behaviors in e-infrastructures. The under lying question that brings it all together is – Can we use Semantic Web techniques to meaningfully detect, retrieve and manipulate such web-traces of activities of scientists in order to improve Scientometrics studies?
A number of concrete projects have already emerged from within this idea with lots of others in the works, including:
work on science blogging: Paul Groth, Thomas Gurney (2010) Studying Scientific Discourse on the Web using Bibliometrics: A Chemistry Blogging Case Study, In Press. In WebSci10: Extending the Frontiers of Society On-Line.
a number of projects on altmetrics including: Julie M.

The unrealized potential of East Portland
BY LINDA BAKER
I sat in on an East Multnomah County Chamber of Commerce meeting this week, and received a brief update on the East Portland Action Plan, which was adopted in 2009 to identify and address gaps in policies, services and infrastructure improvements in East Portland neighborhoods, among the fastest growing in the city.
Specifically, presenters distributed a summary of a recent economic development report outlining some of the area’s competitive advantages—and weaknesses.
From 2005-2009, employment in East Portland actually grew by 7,440 jobs —from 42,483 to 49,923 —an average annual growth rate of 4.4 percent.
Housing and population growth are some of the drivers for employment growth, said Nick Sauvie, executive director of the Rose Community Development Corp, whom I talked to after the meeting. Since 1996, nearly half of the residential units permitted in the entire city of Portland were in East Portland, a total of 8,770 units.
The health care industry is also a strong driver of employment in East Portland. Twenty one percent of the workforce in East Portland is employed in the health care sector, compared to 13 percent in the Metro area.
Job growth, housing and industry strengths are all reasons to be optimistic about the area’s economic potential, Sauvie said. The big problem is lack of investment in urban infrastructure. “If you walk around the Pearl District and then walk around East 122nd, you see a different level of investment in sidewalks, street crossings and other amenities,” Sauvie said, in something of an understatement.
Now city budget mapping data supports that anecdotal impression.
Although 50 percent of housing growth has taken place in East Portland, the city has not spent a commensurate amount on infrastructure. Sauvie said the city spends only 36 percent of the city average on transportation in East Portland and 38 percent of the city average on East Portland parks.
Despite employment growth, nine out of ten East Portland residents also have to commute out of the area to work—a figure that flies in the face of city efforts to create 20-minute neighborhoods, in which residents live, work and recreate within a short distance of home.
Here is one of the takeaways. East Portland seems to have plenty of human capital, but is sorely lacking in physical capital, specifically the mixed-use live/work environments that have put Portland on the map as an urban planning and design mecca—and spurred small business growth in close-in neighborhoods.
That human capital assessment is born out by the area's tremendous ethnic diversity. More than 12.5 percent of the East Portland population is foreign born, compared to less than 10 percent in much of the inner city. “We universally see diversity as a strength and are seeing lot of entrepreneurship in our immigrant communities,” said Sauvie. In a survey conducted by Rose Community Development, first-time home buyers also cited diversity as one of the top three factors that influenced where they bought a house.
In a city that is suffering increasing angst over its increasing whiteness, East Portland leaders may want to brand the area as a beacon of 21st century global culture —and watch as the seeds of the next great Portland neighborhood grow.

…being reminded of the scene from anchorman where the news ppl meet up in the alley way and brawl.
ahahaha!!!
Dorothy Mantooth is a Saint!
Give me a break guys. This comes off as extremely childish tattle tale like. Look mommmy look mommy WECT made a mistake!! teee hee tee hee
No one likes a rat.
So, was any further research done on this breaking story by WWAY? On who’s end was the miscommunication?
Oh wait, I just checked WECT, and they’ve clarified that the discrepancy comes from the dispatcher. You’d think a news station would understand the concept of a developing news story. Much easier to post a scandalous headline and half-report a story on the competition, I guess.
Just decided I will NEVER tune in to WWAY ever again
Bye.
OK, then you shouldn’t post on this WWAY forum either. They put the same news on here that they do on their TV station.
Nice knowing you….
If this is the best “news” reporting you can do, why bother!

Concerned – thanks for your feedback. You sure are aware of many of the elements in the newscast for someone who never watches! Have a great week!!

Does WWAY feel so inferior to WECT that they have to resort to this type of adolescent behavior? The only thing missing at the end of this “News Story”(sic) was; Na-na-na-boo-boo.
It does sound like WECT didn’t report the story correctly…for whatever reason…but, then again, WWAY didn’t exactly do a bang up job either!Okay I gotta go

Lyrics taken fromLast weekend we suggested SD readers that our sources had informed us that JPMorgan’s derivatives losses sustained by their CIO desk had been actually $100 Billion, not the $2 Billion admitted by Jamie Dimon to traders.
Well, one week later, the MSM (WSJ) is now reporting that JPM’s CIO has now lost $5 billion.
Perhaps a lot more fascinating, the WSJ states that Jamie Dimon personally authorized the delta-hedging of its interest price swaps positions which has resulted in the FUBAR derivatives losses for JPM.
So lets get this straight. The Large Cahuna who approved the strategy gets a $23 million bonus, and reappointed as CEO by shareholders, whilst Iksil and boss Achilles who implemented the trade for Dimon get shown the door and have The Morgue try to claw-back their bonuses?
The US mega-bank JPMorgan Chase & Co loss from derivatives trading may widen to 5 billion dollars, the Wall Street Journal reported on Friday. CEO Jamie Dimon personally authorized the approach that led to the trades, with no monitoring how they have been executed, the newspaper said.
JPMorgan last week announced a 2 billion dollars trading loss on synthetic credit products, or derivatives tied to credit functionality. Dimon said the transactions, intended to deal with chance, were “egregious” failures by the bank’s chief investment office. JPMorgan has said the quantity could enhance by 1 billion or much more as it winds down the positions.
Joseph Evangelisti, a spokesman for New York-based mostly JPMorgan, declined to comment on the 5 billion dollar estimate.
The largest US loan provider by assets didn’t have a treasurer for the duration of the five months when the trades took place, the Journal reported in a separate article.
JPMorgan’s chief investment office oversees about 360 billion dollars, or the difference between deposits and what the bank lends. Matt Zames, who was appointed to lead the division after the loss was reported, shook up leadership and announced a “renewed focus” on hedging risks.

Two days after one of Wall Street’s most respected banks, JPMorgan Chase Co (JPM), revealed a market-shaking 2 billion trading loss, CEO Jamie Dimon said his bank was “sloppy” and had committed errors in judgment. He called the position, which was placed out of JPM’s London office and involved an index of corporate credit default swaps,…

It is edited from the best printed and manuscript authorities, with glossarial index and a biographical memoir by Alexander Smith. It is bound in Dark Brown or faded black genuine leather with gold gilt "Burns" on the cover still bright and the same on the spine faded. There is wear especially on the spine with some separation on the lower and upper edges where the front meets the spine on the exterior, see photos, but the book still structurally sound if used with care, and a little glue will do wonders if one desired. The original owner name is written on the ffep, and dated 1899, she was actually a relative of a past Tennessee President and had a huge library of fine historical books and poetry. The book measures 7 & 1/2" by 5 & 1/4" and is 1 & 3/4" thick with shiny gold gilt outer page edges. The insides of both front and back covers have lovely lining papers of a black brown and gold floral. 636 pages, with minimal foxing and minimal age darkening, decent size print for reading as well. Not a perfect copy by any means, but considering the age we think quite nice.

If your hair's bearing the brunt of too much chlorine, salt, sun, and over-styling, you're soooo not alone. My hair is toast. And I don't know about you, but the last thing I can afford to drop a bunch of cash on right now is some fancy-pants salon revitalizing treatment. The solution? DIY to the rescue. Don't get me wrong: I'm not some hippy-dippy, "let's make our own soap" type. But I…
This just in: It is hot out there (just ask Al Gore) and I'm tired of wrestling my humidity-infused hair into submission. Sure, there are ways to combat frizz , and there are a few cute summer styles to try. But I'll be the first to admit that when it's 103 in the shade, I'm too darn lazy and overheated to do even important things (like, say, cook my kids dinner ). So it's a safe bet…
You'd think that I'd had enough hair trauma to last me for a while -- what with my drastic pixie cut , then my red dye fiasco -- but no, apparently not. As you regular readers know, my 9-year-old daughter has long (we're talking down-to-her-butt-never-been-cut long), blonde hair. Sure, it's beautiful and, yes, people stop us on the street and ask her to sing that song from "Tangled,"…
I am the queen of the blowout (looking good is part of my job). I have had one in almost every state in the Union and in quite a few cities abroad. Some have been amazing -- my idea of hair heaven -- and others were more like hair hell. So, to keep myself from being disappointed when I plop into a new stylist's chair, I've come up with a few tips that pretty much guarantee a great result. To…

Hope this new year brings you and yours happiness, prosperity, peace and good health. You kinda need all of these to attend a lot of live theatre!
A special shout out and thank you to our Assistant Organizers for keeping this group active. As you may have noticed, due to my unpredictable work schedule, I have been unable to schedule many Meetups personally, so I am depending on AOs and other members to keep things going. Several of you have seen me working as an usher for events at the sister theaters downtown managed by Team San Jose.
I am currently working as an usher in The Grande Chapiteau (AmaLuna) as well located at the Taylor Street Bridge. It's a beautiful show and I would love to share it with you. If you already have plans to attend, feel free to ask the ushers where I might be working. We might be able to chat at Intermission or before the show starts. Arrive EARLY and plan to walk from parking - both paid and free street parking. Either way, wear comfortable shoes - you will be walking!
If you haven't purchased tickets and have some interest in attending, let me know… I get one comp for myself and a $10 discount off Levels 1 and 2 tix. The show is also listed on Goldstar for certain dates at a more substantial discount. Perhaps we can attend on the same night together, meet up to chat or, if there is enough interest, secure added discounts or extras.
Let me know what you think… what dates might work best and how much you are able or willing to spend for any VIP treatment. Check out the Preview video, prices and extras at:
Even if you don't have the $500 to shell out - eek! - watch the Behind the Scenes video. It's way cool!
All the BEST!

Model: Glanzen 3
Category: Horse Health and Well Being
Purchase: I paid $57.00 for a 20 lb container. I bought it from the manufacturer off their website, horsetech.com.
Likes: I had questions about the product so I e-mailed and they offered me a free sample. It was sent next day UPS mail and was a 5 lb bag. It was then that I hoped I would like the product because their customer service was great!! I wanted it for my warmblood mare, who doesn't like anyone to forget she is mare. I tried it for the attitude part, but was very skeptical. I thought if that part didn't work at least she would have a shiny coat and good feet, which she needed help with anyway. My trainer called me a week later and wanted to tell me how my mare was so nice lately and so willing to work. I got to the barn and noticed she had an even more willing look on her face and instead of the "AAARRGGGHHH I'm still a mare" she looked more like, "Hi Mom, I'm a girl". Don't get me wrong; she doesn't act like a gelding, the stuff isn't that good, but her "attitude" is more pleasant and less reactive to things she doesn't like. She seems more laid back. I also like the FREE shipping. And its not crappy two week free shipping, it is overnight free shipping. I love it!!! Their website is great too and they will modify a formula for your specific needs if you need them too. They also sent a free bag of cookies with the product and a handwritten thank you on the invoice. Its nice, it makes me think they are proud of their product and they should be.
Dislikes: This is where I'm supposed to talk about the price, but I don't think the price is bad. If you compare it to other products with the same amount of biotin you would pay at least that much. And you would have to pay shipping. I'd rather have that rolled in the price so I don't have to be surprised when I checkout how much more I am going to have to pay for S&H. I would like to start my gelding on the Glanzen GL which is $84.00 and at first I thought this was high, but if I were to put him on the Glanzen 3 and a separate glucosamine product I would pay at least $84.00 if not more, so I think the price is far. I don't have any dislikes about this product!!
Quality: It's all quality, the product, the container, everything. Go to the website, horsetech.com and see for yourself. They do a great job of explaining why they are better.
Summary: I can't wait for another two or three months to see if my mares hooves are in as good a shape as he attitude and coat are. Did I mention her coat is gleaming and it took her about a day to shed out. Mind you she was blanketed this winter and she has thin skin, but I really think having her on the Glanzen really helped. I love the free S&H and customer service too.
