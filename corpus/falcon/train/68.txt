Steeped in the brutal horror of lynch-mob racism, blues music can be traced back to the darkest days of the chain-gang chants and church-group spirituals. It eventually spilled out into the local dances and finger-popping juke joints.
Early blues players were the poets of their day, channelling their words of truth through music.
One such player was sharecropper Hayes McMullan, the relatively unknown performer of the magnificent Every Day Seem Like Murder Here.
The songs spring from the murky waters of the Mississippi Delta, in the heart of the racist South.
As the title track laments, people of colour were “born in a desert” and “raised in a lion’s den”. The Depression-era sorrow heard in McMullan’s beautiful voice underpins the history of which he is part.
The call of his crisp, urgent Delta picking style is answered by delicate surges of falsetto.
McMullan’s incredible singing and guitar work sway between the soft and lush and the booming and loud. His songs are simple, but fresh, and retain a hopeful openness about life, despite the harshness of early 20th-century America.
In Hurry Sundown, we hear, “I said, hurry sundown, let tomorrow come. Says, she may bring sunshine, may bring drops of rain.”
An exquisitely raw Smoke Hut Lightning is featured, a song later popularised as Smokestack Lightnin’ by a certain Howlin’ Wolf.
But Hayes McMullan is not a household name.
Explaining why he passed up the chance to record with “father of Delta blues” Charley Patton, he said, “They only offered me $5 a song, and you know they could make thousands off just one song.”
This release ought to ensure McMullan’s rightful place among the better-known Delta greats such as Patton, Robert Johnson, Son House and Willie Brown.
Do yourself a favour—listen to this repeatedly. You will be rewarded.

Art Revolutionaries in London
Just around the corner from posho shop Fortnum and Mason are propaganda posters urging workers to take up arms against fascism.
Art Revolutionaries celebrates the Spanish pavilion at the 1937 Paris exhibition. In the midst of the Spanish civil war it urged support for the Republican government—and sometimes went further.
A surrealist manifesto designed by sculptor Henry Moore calls on artists to fight for revolutionary change. A pamphlet of photos and written testimonies exposes the horror of aerial bombing in Guernica.
Pablo Picasso’s painting of the same now hangs in Madrid. But there is a reconstruction of Joan Miro’s painting El Segador (The Reaper) celebrating the defiant peasants of Catalonia, and later works by both artists.
This is a small exhibition that won’t keep you for long, but with entry free it’s well worth popping in for a taste of the creativity unleashed in one of our class’s greatest struggles.
Night Light
Somewhere in England two teenage asylum seekers, fearing deportation, hide out in an abandoned factory. As the cold night unfolds, they imagine their future and tell each other about their past.
They hear someone else arrive. Terrified, they creep towards the door where they find a familiar figure.
He joins the teenagers and the three of them talk through the night about home, belonging and the system.A spiritual diagnosis suggests that all physical, mental and emotional problems have a deeper spiritual meaning.

The classical social theorists were the best
Durkheim is sometimes characterized as "the sociologist of constraint," meaning that, as he saw it, an unregulated life is devoid of meaning and a source of misery.In a very limited way, one might argue that Durkheim, in contrast to Marx, held that man does have a rudimentary nature, at least in terms of social and cultural needs.People need norms, standards, and social ties to provide them with direction, purpose, knowledge of realistic limits, and a sense of belonging.This is one reason for Durkheim's life-long interest in religion as a social phenomenon.His emphasis on constraint and stability also helps explain why he is commonly regarded as a conservative.
Durkheim was less optimistic than Marx with regard to prospects for the variegated development of human potential.While Marx envisioned opportunities for people to develop a broad range of talents in a self-actualizing way, Durkheim was more cautious.His emphasis on an evermore complex division of labor characterized by increasingly narrow specialization held his expectations in check.
At the same time, however, Durkheim was convinced that a more complex division of labor and the organic solidarity it occasioned enabled individuals to become more independent and self-determining.As with Marx, however, Durkheim was aware that increasing specialization did not serve all interests equally well.
While Durkheim and Marx have more in common than is typically acknowledged, Durkheim did not view the antagonistic character of the capital-labor relationship as inevitable or basic to the structure of capitalist society.In Durkheim's judgment, increasing social and cultural complexity, along with the rise of modern industry and an attendant ethos of reciprocity and complementarity, were more important than the emergence of mature capitalism and the capital-labor dichotomy.
In my view, Durkhiem was wrong.Nevertheless, his struggle to find a basis for social solidarity for modern industrial society prompted him to develop the powerful concepts anomie (or cultural de-regulation) and egoism (or social deracination).These, in turn, led to this brilliant work on the social sources of suicide.Perhaps it's a mark of genius that failures lead to new discoveries which give important areas of intellectual endeavor an entirely new and unexpected conceptual direction.
The Division of Labor in Society
I received the book in a timely fashion and it was properly prepared for shipment.
An Outstanding Book
A unique thesis: the division of labor is morally cohesive, and inheritance of capital is the flaw of capitalism.It is a great counter-argument to Marx and communism. I read this book at the University of Chicago, and I can only hope other institutions also assign it; it is a must read for anybody interested in human interaction.
Although some people may not think this is important, I must also commend The Free Press for producing such a durable book. Many of my books wouldn't survive my travels and annotations as well as this one has.
The Division of Labor in Society
Excellent condition as promised.Timely delivery as well.No complaints, I would buy from this seller again.
Classic...
If you are a) an undergrad. in sociology, economy, or political science, you must have this for grad. school; b) a grad. student in sociology and unsure of its application, what theory is, or what the masters talked about, you must have it; and c) a theory freak like myself, a must for your collection (but you already knew that!).This book is a classic in sociology, and while Durkheim recanted much of what he said later in his career, his ecological model for the evolution of society is still relevant today.Furthermore, his discussion of the integrative effects of the Division of Labor are unmatched, and while this mechanism is probably not the only one of its kind, it is still important especially in a postindustrial society that is increasingly compartementalized...

Product DescriptionIn April 1945 the American 71st Infantry Division exacted the final vestiges of life from the Reich's 6th SS Mountain Division in central Germany. This analysis of the battle demonstrates that the Wehrmacht's last gasp on the Western Front was anything but a whimper, as some historians charge. Instead, Stephen Rusiecki argues, the Wehrmacht fought to extract every last bit of pain possible. The book follows the histories of both the German and American divisions from their inception until their fateful confrontation in April 1945 and serves as a testament to the human experience in war, both from the perspective of the soldiers and from the civilians who suffered the brunt of the fighting. This book is published in cooperation with the Association of the U.S. Army. ... Read more

IN FINAL DEFENSE OF THE REICH
This is an excellent book, on several levels. Not only did Rusiecki conduct meticulous research, but he wrote this tale very well.
The first three chapters introduce the reader to the 6th SS Mountain Division, describing some of the key members, and its history from the beginning of the war up until spring of 1945. As the reader gets closer to March, more detail is provided to better acquaint the reader with what is going on. The third chapter also introduces the units that are going to factor into NORD'S demise, along with their leaders. It is in this chapter that NORD begins to come apart.
From the fourth chapter onward, the reader spends a good bit of time in various headquarters, German and American, from company level all the way up to corps. By making good use of records kept, the author is able to recreate the confusion, tension, excitement and trepidation in the various commands. It is here that the reader begins to understand how in fact NORD was able to function coherently as long as it did.
By pure coincidence, when Gruppenführer Brenner's division fell back through the Palatinate, it happened to travel right along the boundary between two corps. Normally, this would be a good place to be, as coordination of sub-units along a boundary like this can be difficult in good times. In running combat, as the corps drive into the enemy's heartland, it gets even more confusing. Rusiecki has done a fantastic job showing not only the difficulties inherent in an operation like this, but clearly illustrating how the various units were able to work together in harmony to crush NORD.
At the same time, the author's relationship with several veterans of NORD holds him in good stead as he is able to describe the German side of the battle all the way from the division headquarters, through the two elements of the division that separated in order to improve their chances of escape, down to the lowest rifleman. We are able to follow generals, colonels, lieutenants and privates as they slog their way through a cold, drizzly, miserable battle.
One of the good things about this work is its objectivity. Sadly, too many of the books on WWII, especially those that deal with the SS, are somewhat polarized. One side is often portrayed heroically, while the other is derided at every turn. Here, no one is demonized. Honor and courage are shown on both sides, as is fear and treachery. Nothing is held back. I expect that some will chastise Rusiecki for not showing the NORD men as slathering butchers. I would point out that NORD is probably the only division in the Waffen-SS that has been cleared of all allegations of war crimes. Two of those allegations are dealt with in this book.
I would highly recommend this book to anyone with an interest in any of the divisions involved, the Waffen-SS, the end of the war, or the war in general. It is informative, engaging, and a damned good read.
Great story of a little known battle in the closing days of the war
This is an outstanding account of the final battle of the 6th SS Mountain Division "Nord" and its destruction at the hands of the U. S. 71st Infantry Division.I heartily recommend it.As the events occurred in an area familiar to many veterans of the United States Army, Europe; this story stands to remind us of the tremendous changes that have occurred since the final shots were fired over 65 years ago.Furthermore, this story is representative of the historical back drop similar to many other communities in Central Germany that are unfortunately fading into memory with the passing of a generation.
In this his second book, "In Final Defense of the Reich," Mr. Rusiecki combines the detailed research of an academic, the experience of a combat veteran, and the skill of a novelist to produce an outstanding history of a little known action that occurred in the closing days of World War II.This is a truly remarkable yet largely unknown story of a desperate encounter between an experienced formation of the Waffen SS and a relatively inexperienced American Infantry Division. Even more, it is a story typical of the vast majority of veterans in largely unremembered units that is representative of the experience of war for many veterans of the U. S, German, and other armies in other times and places.
The soldiers Mr. Rusiecki writes about are not in the marquee organizations that are the over exposed stars of most histories or dramatizations of the war.They are ordinary men and women who belong to an average unit on both sides of the firing line.While the Germans are members of an SS Mountain Division; the Americans are, for the most part, members of the little reported 71st Infantry Division, along with elements of the 5th Infantry Division, 2nd Dragoons (Cavalry Group), the 761st Tank Battalion(composed of African-American soldiers), and various units of the U. S. XII Corps.While all of these units performed well and honorably, none figure prominently in popular history or mass media.Mr. Rusiecki traces the story of the major units as they move toward their final meeting in Central Germany.In doing so, he also illuminates the mechanisms and actions behind the scenes that each of the combatants established to focus and sustain combat power, secure lines of communication, and meet critical requirements throughout the area of operations.This includes ordinary and mundane, but combat power sapping requirements to guard critical bridges and passages, secure POWs, as well maintain the flanks and momentum of fast moving armored spearheads.A myriad of requirements recognizable to any veteran and yet too often ignored or forgotten in histories.The ancillary demands and circumstances on both sides are crucial in understanding the circumstances that is the focus of Mr. Rusiecki's book.It is also a tribute to Mr. Rusiecki's writing style that this adds to the narrative as he moves it toward the climactic battle.
In describing the three day battle and destruction of a weakened yet still dangerous SS Mountain Division, Mr. Rusiecki effectively interweaves the perspective of leaders, soldiers, and civilians from each side through a well crafted narrative.Mr. Rusiecki includes first person accounts from both sides of the line to ensure balance to the story.It is here that he truly hits the target.His descriptions of the confusion of war, the stress of combat, and the vicissitudes of command are reflective of one who has "seen the elephant."Mr. Rusiecki's skill in describing the action makes this a great read; the book has the feel of a novel.Mr. Rusiecki grabs the reader and carries them into the fight as if they were riding on the back deck of a Sherman Tank like the infantryman he describes in the story.
An outstanding volume that would be a welcome addition to any collection, I heartily recommend it to anyone with an interest in World War II, the ETO, The U. S. Army, or has served in Central Germany (as they will recognize most of the locations described).

Must read!
Any true Joy Division fan will see this as a must read! Chris Ott does a great job!
Oh sigh.
I thought this would be an overly pedantic study of the album, but it is really more of an overview of ALL of Joy Division's recordings with little focus on "Unknown pleasures" itself.This wasn't unwelcome to me as someone who always gets confused as to the chronology of Joy Division recordings.Moreover, the book contains a decent (but not overwhelming) amount of biographical anecdotes which, ultimately, makes this a very readable and enjoyable book.
Not quite Closer, but ...
quite informative nonetheless.Chris Ott does a good job after setting the stage, a little clunky in the beginning, but afterwards, he settles in and gives all the info any fan would either enjoy ... or already know.Now, if somebody would do Closer ...
Good stuff!

Great book from a seldom seen perspective
First of all, to all the "armchair generals" giving this book a bad review. It's intended to be a memoir from a individual soldier, not a scholarly thesis written by a professional historian. Sure, like most memoirs from WWII, he gets a few facts wrong, especially when it comes to the big picture. Lieutenants got their info from the grapevine, just like the average GI. But what Cooper gives is an expert eyewitness view of a seldom heard story, that of the maintenance effort behind the front lines. He knew the M4 Sherman inside and out, and understood what it took to keep them running in the field. His general theme is absolutely correct. The Sherman was inferior to German tanks. It burns me up when I read people who have never been in action criticizing a veteran who risked his life traveling behind the front lines, with just a driver and a carbine. So what if he missed a few dates and towns. What were you doing 60 years ago? War is not a game. It's blood and guts and fear and misery. The author portrays that accurately. One of the best books I've read in a while. Buy it if you love reading accounts of those who were actually there. If you are looking for a sterile comparison of armor thickness, gun velocity, etc, this is not it.
Death Traps The Survival of an American Armored Division in World War ll
Great reading. Being a vet myself and a memeber of 126 maintains in Germany from 68 to 70 I saw just what I read in the book. No it was not combat but the waste of man power and equipment was a joke.
Reading the death trap goes to show that nothing in the Armed forces has change from WWll to today. We will have leads not leading from the front and the book calls it has a man in the front saw it.
Only trouble is if you never been in the armed forces you will think this book could be so. But believe me a vet and service brat the book is more real than you think. A lot of things have not change.
Too much fiction, not enough history
I'll keep mine simple, as Robert Forczyk already provided an excellent review. This work is more a work of fiction than history, and I was sorely disappointed in the content. Of interest, I had spoken to one of the reviewers who is quoted on the dust jacket and he told me that he had not endorsed the book in entirety, but the publisher cherry-picked a quote from his review to buttress it. For additional points see my comment I attached to R.Forczyk's one star review.
The Cost of Tank Warfare
This is a memoir of an Army Ordnance Officer who was "lucky" enough to get the job of finding broken down or destroyed Shermans in WW2 France and Germany, getting them back to the maintenance folks for fixing up and getting them back on the front lines.
Author Belton Cooper tells the reader exactly what the consequences of the decisions that led to the creation of, and use of, the M-4 Sherman tank. In 1941, the US did not even have a medium tank and the knowledge of tank warfare was still in its infancy. By 1943, our factories started mass production of the Sherman tank, which was a good tank, but not a great one. The US opted for ease of production and reliability at the expense of armor protection and firepower. The crews of the tanks are the ones who paid that bill. Cooper also had to pay a price by finding salvageable tanks that had been knocked out, crews dead and burned inside, get the mess cleaned up and repair the tank. He leaves you with no doubt of his opinion of the usefulness of the Sherman tank.
There is excitement in the book - battle lines are fluid - sometimes, you find yourself all alone, out in front of your lines in enemy territory - at night, in a jeep with only you and a rifle trying to find a tank. When asking for directions, a German POW tells him which way is safe - do you trust him or not? These are just some of the everyday challenges Cooper faces in doing his job. He does it well and is justifiably proud of his contributions in WW2.
I highly recommend this book for anyone interested in tanks, WW2, heroism, the behind the scenes service that millions of Americans gave without being in combat. It's an eye opener, a revealing tale of what goes on behind the lines and how important that it.
Changes your perception of American equipment in WWII
We Americans are given great propaganda for free.Our aircraft were second to none in WWII except when you find out one german ace knocked down 7 P-38 aircraft in one mission.Stalin generally didn't like most allied fighter aircraft.The Russian Army called the Grant tank "a coffin for seven brothers".The B-24 had one wing spar that was over a fuel tank.Hit the tank, the spar would break, and nobody could bail out.
Belton Cooper was a army Ordnance officer with the 3rd Armored Division and it was his job to make sure the M-4 Sherman tanks ran.And few tanks were as dreadful as the Sherman tank.Cooper got his degree from the University of Michigan as a marine (ship) engineer.So, the army made him a vehicle maintenance officer.
Belton does a great job describing the pitfalls of the Sherman.Yes, it was a better tank than the Grant, which was perhaps the worst major production tank of '41 to '42.But Mr. Cooper gives the average reader a lot of insight into the absolute problems of the Sherman.Indeed, on the follow up T-26 tanks - the fairly good Pershing tanks - you can almost read the Army reports that say "don't follow anything done one the M-4 Sherman.
Mr. Cooper really hates the machine and says great things about his mechanics.I was always impressed with their can-do attitude.Here is another story from the book.The M-4 Shermans used a radial aircraft engine.Tanks tend to do a lot of sitting around waiting for action.So, the spark plugs on the engines would fowl.Those spark plugs had to be cleaned.Lieutenant Cooper organized parties to go to the French beaches, get the sand, wash the salt from it, dry the sand, and used that sand in the sand blaster to clean the spark plugs that kept the tanks running.Yes, the Army didn't buy enough spark plugs for the tanks.
Lieutenant Cooper's maintenance section was the union that invented the hedge row cutters that allowed the allied break out from the hedgerow country at Normandy.Cooper says they never did have enough hedgerow cutters.But since the tactical employment was as a mass of breakout all at once it took the Germans by surprise.
Cooper's book really gets across his hate of the M-4.Seriously, he hates that machine.And he gives good reasons for the hate.In one battle the Shermans mix it up with some Tigers.A group of Shermans take cover behind some knocked out Shermans.No problem for the Germans.The Tigers merely shoot through the knocked out Shermans and kill the Shermans in the battle.
Lieutenant Cooper also documents the rather grim job of tank recovery.Cooper's maintenance section, if they could salvage a tank, would totally rebuild the knocked out Sherman.Indeed, this could be done in a matter of days.However, if the Sherman caught on fire it would cook the crew, like a huge human pot roast.So, Cooper's men working with the graves registration soldiers (mortuary) would extract the bodies, wash out the tanks, rebuild the tanks, and paint the tanks.But it never quite worked.The new crews would notice the smell of cooked flesh over the fresh coat of paint.That was a pretty grim read.Who needs Stephen King's novels after reading that.
Cooper's indictments of the M-4 do not stop at its combat short commings.Lieutenant Cooper lays some of the blame of the stalled fall offensive squarely on the M-4 Sherman machine.The official story is the allies ran short of supplies.Considering the excellent job that the transportation corp did and the masterful job of U.S. Army logistics in WWII, Mr. Cooper's writings make absolute sense.The bottom line is it appears one of the reason that Operation Market Garden failed is because the British Shermans were knocked out in droves.When the American forces stall in the post October advance it's squarely the fault of the Sherman.It appears that nearly any German anti-tank weapon was successful against the Sherman.
Lieutenant Cooper's book is an absolute counter-point to all the bragging about American equipment in WWII.While some historians, like the late and overrated Stephen Ambrose, would wax poetic about Americans and their equipment the bottom line is our equipment made the men gun shy.Why?Who wants to burn to death in a second rate tank?
I would say any WWII university level studies should have this book on the required reading list.This book knocks out some myths of WWII and gives good insight into the problems our soldiers faced in WWII.

A disappointment
I found this book a disappointment, but then again I'm not a "Waffenista" who will unquestionably accept anthing written that portrays the Waffen-SS as the greatest multiethnic pan-European combat arm of all time.
Bishop's research is only fair, with some glaring errors. I found his omission of the mass executions committed by the 8th SS Florian Geyer division against Jewish civilians to be a grave error that only further perpetuates the myth of the Waffen-SS as "separate and untainted" from the crimes of the Third Reich and the SS in particular. He also doesn't cover the units such as the 25th or 31st SS divisions, which barely had enough rifles, let alone vehicles. Books like Bishop's give the mistaken impression that all W-SS units were armed to the teeth with Tiger and Panther tanks, which was certainly not the case.
The illustrations are good-quality, standard 4-color airbrush work of similar caliber that you'd see from Squadron or Osprey.
The Orders of Battle (i.e. unit structures) are basic and don't get into the "devil in the details" level that would be useful to get an understanding of the vehicle types used by the W-SS. One is better off tracking down one of the ORBATS from James Dugdale.
In short, WAFFEN SS DIVISIONS, 1939-1945 (The Essential Vehicle Identification Guide) will satisfy the more impressionable, less knowledgeable WWII researcher at a good price point, but isn't a work that a more well-read consumer should purchase.
The non essential essential guide
I didn't mind the first volume on the Panzer Divisions of this 3 part set but by the time this one has come out I think they have run out of colour plates. This is meant to be a vehicle guide but there are only so many times I can see the same Flak or Pak gun reprinted and presented as belonging to different divisions. If you're a keen reader of German armour who'll easily pick up the many glaring mistakes such as the GD Panther 01 which is printed a number of times, the 251/9 1144 which was a 2SS vehicle presented belonging to more than one division. Surely they could have done more colour plates with vehicles from the more photograhped divisions. I appreciate it would be virtually impossible to get an accurate photo from each division but to just make it up seems a bit lazy. I've seen the same trucks, kubelwagens, Pak guns, bikes through the whole series and that's just either laziness or poor editing. I think I have seen the same 250/9 and 251/9 from 19 Panzer Division at Kursk printed at least half a dozen times through the whole series and that's bad. If these are your first books on german armour ok, but there are better ones out there and these will eventually end up in the bottom of your pile never to be read again. sorry Mr Bishop

Product DescriptionThe four real division algebras (reals, complexes, quaternionsand octonions) are the most obvious signposts to a rich and intricaterealm of select and beautiful mathematical structures. Using the newtool of adjoint division algebras, with respect to which the divisionalgebras themselves appear in the role of spinor spaces, some of thesestructures are developed, including parallelizable spheres,exceptional Lie groups, and triality. In the case of triality the useof adjoint octonions greatly simplifies its investigation. Motivatingthis work, however, is a strong conviction that the design of ourphysical reality arises from this select mathematical realm. Acompelling case for that conviction is presented, a derivation of thestandard model of leptons and quarks. The book will be of particular interest to particle and high energytheorists, and to applied mathematicians. ... Read more
I am waiting for Dixon 's Octonians...

Mathematics behind physics
This is an excellent book for those who want to study Hamilton's quaternions, and other algebraic structures, used in modern physics. Dixon believes that octonions and triality of Spin(8) are essential in understanding particle physics. This clear exposition contains many ideas which have gone unnoticed from other researchers. The book is a treasure trove for mathematical physicists. The author also compares the Cayley algebra of octonions to other algebraic systems used in physics: matrices and Clifford algebras, in particular the Dirac algebra.

informative
Well written and informative about the relationship Curtis had with wife and family... if you love the band well worth a read.
This Book Should Have Been Written By Someone Else
In my honest opinion, this book should have been written by someone else because his wife just complains and complains about her dead husband and all the bad things he did until his suicide. It could have been better if a band member wrote it because they would have told his most of his struggles living his life with epilepsy. They could describe how hard it was for him to perform in front of thousands of people with bright lights beaming on him causing him to fight his epileptic episodes. Even though this book was some what interesting it could have been better.
not for everyone
I thought the box set was great.Tunes that stick in your head.I had never heard of them until I saw the movie "Control",which also is great. This set is not for everyone,but each disc can stand alone by itself.
"It was almost as if it was unfashionable to be happy"---Deborah Curtis
As another reviewer noted, "Touching From A Distance" is the perfect title to this book.The further one reads, the greater the distance grows between Ian Curtis (legendary singer/songwriter for Joy Division) and his wife Deborah.The five years of their marriage (at the age of 19) moved quickly to ruin.The most detailed accounts of Ian were their teen years and the early part of their marriage. By the end of book, it seems like Deborah and Ian hardly knew or understood each other at all.Probably no one truly understood Ian Curtis.He is painted in this book as a self-destructive young man full of contradictions.He could be extremely caring and generous giving away possessions to friends or empathizing with those he helped as Assistant Disablement Resettlement Officer, and he could be possessive and controlling choosing his wife's friends or rejecting a band member's girlfriend.Those who know Joy Division's music see the dark side of Curtis through his lyrics but he was known to his band mates as a fun-loving guy who liked to play pranks.
Deborah interviewed the band members and others connected to Joy Division (i.e. Tony Wilson, Rob Gretton, Paul Morely) to fill in gaps in her book which help especially when the band and touring created a gulf between Ian and his family.Although "Touching" is over 200 pages, the story is only 139 pages long.It is beefed up with a detailed Joy Division discography, gig list, and57 pages of song lyrics including "unseen lyrics."I had not read much about Curtis and Joy Division, so I learned a lot.I had just assumed Curtis was born with epilepsy and did not know he acquired it as an adult and after studying it for his job in the civil service.He actually performed his curious dancing style that seemed to mimic epileptic fits at his wedding reception, years before he was diagnosed with epilepsy.
Deborah's account seems very honest.I think she was fair in her treatment of her husband's mistress Annik Honore.She relays stories of how Annik was demanding and bossed Ian around and was not supportive during Ian's fits, but I did not sense a mean spirited tone that one would understand from a jilted wife.She admits that they were rivals and, when Ian wrote that he hated Annik in his final letter, Deborah admits that he probably "wrote that to try to please me" (132).She included in her book that he wrote "give my love to Annik" in the letter written before his earlier failed suicide attempt (115).There is also no anger towards Ian.One issue I don't think is addressed much is that he killed himself in their home where it would most likely be his wife who would find his body.What if she had daughter Natalie with her?How traumatic for a child to see her father hanged.Fortunately that did not happen, but there was no regard to how the way he killed himself would affect his family much less committing suicide in and of itself.Whatever the illness, medication, stress, and demons were doing to Ian's mind, the effect his death had on his family and friends probably did not factor into his ultimate decision and action. As incomplete as it is, I am glad Deborah told her story as it gives some insight into a legend who will remain a mystery.It was made into an award-winning biopic called "Control" in 2007.The book offers eight pages of photos including the last photo Deborah took of her husband with their daughter taken 5 days before he took his life.
Great quick read with enough details of Ian's Life w/& without Joy Division
This is a must READ !! Very powerful and very sad...
Deborah Curtis tells it like it was to be married to Ian Curtis, his life as she saw him, and his band Joy Division. The best thing about this book, is that Debbie includes all of Ian's lyrics (made to to real song, to complete unreleased songs, to notes, and poems. The book is a short read, but it is very well written. If you haven't seen the movie 'CONTROL (2007)'...which is based on this book; Ian Curtis (frontman of Joy Division), his life (on stage and off), his band Joy Division (with it's rise to FAME to nothing), and of course Ian's tragic SUICIDE the night before they were to embark on their U.S. tour in 1980. Read the book and get the movie...in either order.
The best handbook to both the movie and Debbie's book, is the DVD Documentary called "Joy Division - The True Story of the Meteoric Rise & Fall of 1 of the most Influential Bands of out time". It goes hand and hand with the book, and then drills down in detail from all of the band member's of Joy Division regarding Ian's suicide; his influence on the band, his battle with epilepsy (& the effects on everyone's life), and how 4 guys that could barely play or sing turn into 3 great musicians and a song writer that has ended up in the top 10 songwriter's of all time...
I promise you will be amazed how many Joy Division songs you know...mostly because so many bands and artists have covered them.
As their manager, Rob Gretton, said when they met the 4 young kids from Macclesfield..."I am a [...] believer in Joy Division !!"
"Touching from a Distance" is a beautifully sad, true story of a young man that was surrounded by love, and ultimately killed by it...and those around him suffered as a result of his love and his fight with both Epilepsy; as well as, his mental illnesses (bi-polar disorder, schizophrenia, mania).
An almost unbelievable TRUE story of a Rock Band, their troubled Frontman (Ian), and their rise to stardom in just 2 albums...and at the same time, their FALL...
Only a very brave woman, could have wrote this book. Deborah Curtis become an author (and a great writer), due to circumstance (the death of her 23-yr old husband...Ian Curtis), rather than ambitious intentions. Hat's off to ya Deborah Curtis !!
I give the book; as well as, the Movie, and the DVD Documentary, a 10 !!
Go out and buy all 3 at once. I read and watched all 3 in less than a day. Since then, I have re-read the book twice, and watched the 2 DVDs many times over (bc I keep showing them to friends and fans of true, raw, almost LOST music...)
Some stories truly are more SAD, than what Movies or Fiction Books can come up with.

CharlemagneSS 33dDiv
Not the book I thought it would be.My advice is not to buy.Lacks any real new research data.Author did not do his homework
Short, thus incomplete, at times plain, history of the sole French SS unit
Yet another short story of the short-lived ss-division « Charlemagne ». But this time by THE famed specialist of the battle of Berlin and its region.
Once again don't expect any unique photos, all are well-known, alas too dark and a little blurred.
The book reposes on the comments of the divisional commander, general Krukenberg and the only too-well known and much lauded French ss-junior officer H. Fenet. A pity these are the sole testimonies found in this book, knowing that there are other survivors (after all, isn't it the job of a historian ?) and that quite a few have written books or were interviewed by history magazines .
The only too often-related scene of French ss combatants being decorated with the coveted knight's cross in the candle light of Berlin's underground has been repeatedly counted in less serious publications. A pathos I find too romanced.
A study of the Red army's tank losses in the district defended by units of the division would have been preferable as well as Soviet accounts of the fighting.
Also the origins of the French ss-sturmbrigade, its members, and the impact in its amalgamation with the newly created division, would have been welcome.
What happened to the few truck loads of French ss that were cut off on their way to Berlin ?(the author explanation is too general)
How did the capture of the different French ss (officers, groups, stragglers,formations,etc ...)occur and what happened from there would have been an invaluable addition. I have seen in another publication a photo showing three French-ss having just been captured by Red army's Polish soldiers. I have also read that the French ss Christian de la Mazière (who wrote "le rêveur casqué") was also captured by regular soviet army Polish soldiers.
What about their fate ? At least for some of them. A study of individuals that joined the Foreign Legion in Indochina would be a premiere.
Oddly enough no mention is made of the young ss-officer Albert Chapy who after bouts of hard fighting and heroic stands was court-martialled by the WH for having executed some German REMF ?
All in all I would have liked to learn more about divisional commander G. Krukenberg's career as well as Ustuf. Weber's and his compagnie d'honneur/ Kampfschule, about the equipment the division received, down to the uniforms they wore (camouflaged or feldgrau ?)and so on.
The author nevertheless tries to stay factual although once again one cannot escape the usual prose like: "the voices of women not far from us howling in their distress, despair and anguish as the men from the steppes assert their bestiality".
Oh yes the fact that the Soviets raped the whole city as well as the numerous places they occupied is beyond doubt.
But what of the Wehrmacht that helped itself with the women encountered during the victorious blitzkrieg advances on the eastern front and its following merciless occupation ?
How should the German soldiers have been described ? The men from one of the most civilized and advanced part of western Europe who asserted their profligacy, by raping and torching entire regions ?
Naturally, one doesn't absolve the other. Atrocities remain atrocities whether exacted in revenge or not.
Not a bad book, but yet incomplete. No this is not the definitive book on the waffen-ss division named "Charlemagne". We will have to wait ....
An Account of the French Division...
Tony Le Tissier has written a number of books on the last battles of World War II and in particular, several books on "The Battle of Berlin". I have read two of his other books on the Berlin fighting and this one I rate as a good book, overall. The book weaves together eyewitness, first person narrative from former members of the division and information from the historian/author's own research. The fact is this subject matter does not have a large amount of detailed records and data to draw upon as there is with other divisions and subjects in World War II history.
The book relies heavily on materials collected by Robert Soulat, who was a Corporal with the division. The division was made up of several groups: the Legion des Volontaires Francais (LVF), the Milice Francais and the French Storm Brigade of the Waffen SS. The book covers the history of the formation in detail.
The LVF first fought on the Eastern Front with the Wehrmacht-Heer's Infanterie Regiment 638 in 1941. In 1943, they were sent back to the East Front, again. In the spring of 1944, all foreign soldiers were transferred to the Waffen-SS. This division was officially formed in August, 1944. The division was led by Waffen-SS Brigadeführer Dr. Gustav Krukenberg. The general accounts for much of the narrative in the book. Total division strength in January 1945: 6,363 men.
The work has a fast paced, lively narrative and covers the brutal combat with the Soviet Army. Starting with Chapter 8 the "Battle of Berlin" is covered. At a time when many were trying to leave Berlin, this division answered the call and went head-long into the abyss. Knights Cross winner, Captain Fenet is another main narrator of this section. Biographies of Knights Cross winner, Sgt. Eugene Vaulot and Lt. Wilhelm Weber are two that are featured in this section.
Chapter 9 covers the end, after the "Battle of Berlin" and the fate of the remaining units that did not make it to Berlin. After that is: Annex A & Annex B, that cover the formation history in summany and the Initial Command structures. The book tries to give the history of the division in an objective manner and is not overly political. I rate the book four stars. It is easy to read.

Excellent Look at Chicago & USA
This early effort stands with the best oral histories by author/radio host Stud's Terkel.In the mid-1960's Terkel took his tape recorder and let dozens of ordinary Chicagoans open up.Showing our City's diversity and divisions, we hear from executives, laborers, teachers, factory hands, social workers, rich, poor, and middle-class.Many are white, others are black ("Negro") or Latino, and they range from young swingers, to stressed-out parents, to aged retirees.Nearly all offer engaging tales, views, and outlooks.Among the major issues are life in Chicago, work, racial tensions, Vietnam, worship, Martin Luther King, the Bomb, opportunity, and (President) Lyndon Johnson.Anton Faber describes tool-and-die making in The Kaiser's Germany and then Chicago after arriving in 1912.Eva Barnes recalls coal miners, teen marriages, and bootlegging in her small town, plus working in Chicago's once-vast stockyards.Janice Majewski and her colleagues describe teaching at Marshall High School, then as now one of our city's more troubled facilities.Luci Jefferson arrived seeking work in the Great Migration of Southern Blacks, while activist Florence Scala fought City Hall.Many support the elusive goal of racial reconciliation, others nervously sense the decline of the traditional factory economy (replaced by white-collar services).As with many later Terkel efforts, the interviewees lean more left than right, with definite strains of anti-establshment sentiment - even among some we'd labed as distinctly "establishment."
Studs Terkel (1912-2008) made his mark by letting his subjects do the talking, and readers are better off for it.I'd have liked to hear from even more persons, plus those then fleeing to suburbia due to racial fears - what greater division existed both then and today? Still, this stellar book is as worth reading as many later Terkel efforts like HARD TIMES, WORKING, AMERICAN DREAMS, COMING OF AGE, etc.
Chicagoans on Chicago
Division Street is Studs Terkel's attempt to make sense of Chicago. Terkel constructs Division Street in the "oral-history" style that he used in so many of his other works; specifically, he went out into Chicago, recorded a group of interviews with people who represented a cross section of 1960s Chicago, and then included verbatim quotes from his interviewees in Division Street.
Perhaps the best part of the book is the candor with which Terkel's subjects speak. I am not certain how Terkel got his interview subjects to drop their guards, but it seems that no subject is taboo. After reading the book, you do have the feeling that you "know" each of the interviewees on a fairly-deep level.
If I have a criticism of Division Street, it is that the book is something of a downer. Terkel's books focus on the disappointments and frustrations of life. In Division Street he is particularly concerned with race relations and The Bomb. Though I liked the book, prospective readers should be aware that it is by no means uplifting.
Each reader will come away with a feeling that he or she knows something of Chicago. In the end, Terkel leaves the conclusions up to the reader. I suspect, therefore, that different readers will interpret Division Street in different ways. For those readers who want to learn something about Chicagoans, the effort will be worthwhile.
One of the finest from a master
I just reread this book as a kind of wake to Terkel after his passing.I first read it in my mid-twenties and was completely absorbed.Now, almost twenty years later, I've just finished it alongside Joseph P. Lash's "Franklin and Eleanor" and I'm fascinated by how topical both books seem as Obama prepares to take office amid economic catastrophe, internal homeland strife, and war.The '30s, the late '60s, and our times seem like stepping-stones in history, so similar in revolutionary content:forward-thinking, transformative and yet violent and painful.Yet the differences are clear, too.Depression-era policies focused just to establish social programs; civil rights had to wait 'til another day.That day emerged during the time covered by "Division Street," which reveals how far from black-and-white those issues were even to people who felt strongly about them.Time and again as I read I thought, this book was written forty years ago...some of these people must still be alive.What do they think now?And that question begged another:What will we think in forty years?If for no other questions than these, "Division Street" is abundantly worth reading.It's a true American classic--the voice of her people.
Sweet Home, Chicago
As I have done on other occasion when I am reviewing more than one work by an author I am using some of the same comments, where they are pertinent, here as I did in earlier reviews. In this series the first Studs Terkel book reviewed was that of his "The Good War": an Oral History of World War II.
Strangely, as I found out about the recent death of long time pro-working class journalist and general truth-teller "Studs" Terkel I was just beginning to read his "The Good War", about the lives and experiences of, mainly, ordinary people during World War II in America and elsewhere, for review in this space.) from Studs' own generation who survived that event, fought World War II and did or did not benefit from the fact of American military victory and world economic preeminence, including those blacks and mountain whites who made the internal migratory trek from the South to the North..

A Time to Reconcile
(posted by Christopher Laird)
I read Consuming Jesus with great interest to see if the bases were covered on race, class and
consumerism in the Church to my satisfaction. So I even read it critically. They were even covered
more thoroughly than I expected!I really appreciate Paul's coverage of religion and politics and the negative influence that this toxic mix has had on the Body of Christ.As an African American, and as Director of a Ministry of Reconciliation I was constantly looking for Principles I could use in my Ministry.There are lots of them. Paul blasts the "Retreating Battle Camps and Homogeneous Units." Andrightfully so.After all the subject of oneness and unity was heavy on Jesus' mind as he prayed on the night before his crucifixion (John 17:20--23). Paul courageously calls out those elitist churches that are fraught with racism, classism and consumerism. As a son of Alabama born in the 1940s (I left there for good in 1963 after graduating from high school), I was not welcome in white churches. It tainted my view of the Body of Christ and of white people in general (I have long-since repented of that). In fact, I found it hard to imagine even heaven being integrated. How many young people today I wonder are forming biases like this toward the Church and God Himself? Paul courageously addresses the need for the Church to properly represent Jesus, that the world may know that the Father sent Him. And that the world may know that he sent us today. Paul ends by sharing steps toward a solution to the problems. And the afterword by Dr. John M. Perkins is great on the solution.

Finally...
Finally...a book has entered the dialogue that holds together the difficult tension of pragmatic and local ecclesiology with profound theological depth.Metzger is refreshing in his critique by not suggesting some sort of new and better moralism, but rather, offering reflections on the most ancient of christian practices (eucharist) as the antidote to our unfettered consumerism, and the inevitable divide our consumerism causes.As one who longs to see diversity in ethnicity and economic status live in the church, this book serves as a mandatory primer.
Metzger suggests that the practice of consuming Jesus as our daily bread requires that we hold together both the church's unique identity and its call to serve the world.He states: the church must "hold firmly to the politics of Jesus," to serve "without abandoning their distinctive qualities and traits, all of which can bring richness to church and civil unity."For those who yearn for the church's transformation of culture, this book is a necessary check for the temptations which will accompany that journey..
Upside-down Consumption
The reorienting of the Church's vision is the path towards moving beyond `race and class divisions in a consumer church.'Now more than ever it is essential for academics, pastors, laypersons, seekers, philosophers and the like to have a book that illumines the profundity of God's actions for the world in and through His Church-- 'Consuming Jesus' is just this book.One does not need to look hard to read about racial and class tensions today in society.From the `Beer Summit' to the commodification of one's virginity upon eBay, society is saturated with the overarching effects of consumerism.The Church has lost its first love and is in need of a `great awakening.''Consuming Jesus' is the trumpet's call for the Church today as there is no greater need for the follower's of Christ than to be consumed by Jesus.
Dr. Metzger is the voice crying out in the wilderness leading the Church towards the holistic vision encompassed in the incarnational life of its Saviour.In order for the Church to be the `bride of Christ,' it must `move beyond the debased visions of moralism and escapism' (93) towards the living God so to participate in His `captivating love' and `downward mobility that overturns structures and frees captives' (97).Dr. Metzger's words are a call for `true discipleship' that seeks the `upside-down living' that flows from an `inside-out heart in which heaven dwells' (98).The absoluteness of divine love is rooted in the overflowing love of Father, Son, and Spirit--this love has been poured out into the hearts of the body of Christ.The consumption of this love--the consumption of Jesus--is that which propels the Church towards the pouring out of itself into the lives of the other.
In his final dialogue with the Church, Dr. Metzger illumines how the Church of Christ, with a heart focused upon the wedding feast, is able to engage in self-examination as self-examination is essential if we in the evangelical church truly desire to fully engage culture.Self-examination is a boycotting of the market forces that seek to commodify as opposed to building communion.Spirit led self-examination is not an examination done through the power of self, but selflessness as it is in the truest sense a look at self through a Spirit driven heart that is in union with Jesus Christ.The type of self-examination being discussed is one that should embody the Church as it is bound up in the mutual union with Christ through the Holy Spirit.
Metzger's discussion involves reconciliation and redistribution which entails: (1) the redistribution of responsibility and blame, which is based in corporate solidarity in Adam's sin; (2) the redistribution of need through the `humble sprit of giving and receiving replacing the haughty spirit of charity and snobbery toward the poor'; (3) redistribution of resources, talents, and goods whereby affluent churches work together with churches in downtrodden communities `to foster and maintain an "incarnate" presence of healing and hope'; (4) redistribution of ownership, allowing for the poor to take ownership of their own communities through the intentional actions of churches who can provide the means for this to be done; (5) redistribution of Glory, in this case as with all cases, `giving it all to the Lord' (143-63).Only through the action of God can the Church examine herself from the inside out, to take responsibility for the sins of the Church so to be able to purify herself through the Blood of the Lamb as she eagerly awaits her wedding feast.Metzger's assessment of the Church today is spot-on as society is need of the Church to 'be' the Church, and this is exactly what 'Consuming Jesus' illumines.It is not an exaggerated statement to say that this book is a timeless must read.
Paradigm-Shifting Book
I loved this book for several reasons.
1. I love this book because it is a critique of evangelicalism by a man who is a committed evangelical. I love the humility of the book as Dr. Metzger admits to being a part of the problem, but boldly calls us to move and take action. I think this brokenness and humility is very Christlike. It is definitely something that I want to follow him in.
2. I love this book because it deals with a major blindspot of evangelicals: race and class divisions in the church. I was talking to a Hispanic pastor (Jessie) who I met in Nashville. Jessie is pastoring in Texas, and Rich Stafford and I were asking him about his ministry. He commented that Texas is completely integrated. Mexicans and Caucasians do everything together. The only place that is not integrated, he said, is the church. This is tragic. And this is not just a Texas problem.
3. I love this book because it helps to identify subtle ways that we contribute to race and class divisions in the church. We often run our ministries and programs in such a way that they feed our comfort levels. We willingly divide by taste. We have a homogeneous model, which basically drives us to appeal to a certain kind of person and then surround them with people who are like them. We do this all kinds of ways, whether it is by small groups that are affinity groups, whether it is by having a contemporary service and a traditional service, or whether it is by highlighting and emphasizing ministries that are more about appealing to tastes than about following Christ (not wasting our lives).
4. I love this book because it rediscovers the biblical emphasis of walls being broken down by the gospel. Ephesians 2 talks about Jews and Gentiles becoming one in Christ. 1 Corinthians 11 (the communion passage) rebukes the Corinthians because the rich are disregarding the poor. Jesus said that outsiders will know that we are his disciples by our love for one another. The gospel is reflected beautifully when we experience unity between young and old, rich and poor, black, white, hispanic, asian, native american, and any other group that we often segregate. That's what I want! How awesome would it be to have our churches reflect the unity that Christ brings, instead of unintentionally communicating that you need to be like us to go to our church. Otherwise, go find one that meets your tastes.
5. I love this book because it challenges me on who my heroes are. Are my heroes those who have glowing success stories? Or are my heroes those who have been poured out for the work of the gospel? At the end of his life, Paul said that he had no regrets. He said that he had fought the good fight, run the race, kept the faith. Then he talked about being poured out as a drink offering. Paul's version of success was to be poured out for Christ. Jesus himself, in John 12, said that unless a grain of wheat falls to the ground, it cannot bear any fruit. I want to follow Christ (and Paul, and Wilberforce, and MLK, and others) by losing my life for him.
Anyway, I obviously recommend this book. It is convicting and challenging, but it is hitting on a blind spot that many of us have (I know it is a blind spot of mine). It is well worth the time that it will take to read.
Why the Kingdom Should Be Reflected in our Local Congregations
Does the consumerist mindset of contemporary evangelicalism harm our witness to the gospel of Jesus Christ? In Consuming Jesus: Beyond Race and Class Divisions in a Consumer Church, Paul Louis Metzger answers "yes." And Metzger goes even further: consumerism affects the church by reinforcing the race and class divisions of society.
Consuming Jesus is one of the most engaging books I've read in recent days. Metzger exposes evangelicalism's consumerism for what it is: a capitulation to the market forces of capitalist culture that is detrimental to the unity of the gospel across races and classes.
Meztger begins by showing how evangelicals first retreated from culture and politics, which prepared the way for a disordered consumerist vision that blinds us to racialization, the market mindset, success, and social structures. He critiques the political aspirations of both the Religious Right and Left. He takes on the church growth strategists' emphasis on homogeneity. He challenges churches to no longer prop up the materialistic lifestyles of congregations that keep rich and poor, black and white apart.
What I Liked
1. Metzger is prophetic in his call for evangelicals to open their eyes to the race and class divisions in our churches. I like how he pulls from all corners of the church for his critique: from Jonathan Edwards to Martin Luther King, Jr., from John Wesley to John Perkins. Metzger is not interested in promoting another already-in-practice agenda. He looks at the faithful witness of Christians throughout history to challenge the church to move back to its mission.
2. Metzger challenges us to avoid the moralistic trap. No one can accuse Metzger of advocating a social gospel that challenges societal structures while leaving individual human hearts unchanged. Throughout the book, Metzger praises the evangelical emphasis on personal regeneration, even as he chides us for being too self-focused sometimes to see even our own glaring weaknesses.
3. The first half of Consuming Jesus is heavy on critique, but the second half is heavy on practical application. Metzger does not merely complain about the current state of evangelicalism; he offers clear suggestions for changing things. Especially helpful is Metzger's call for us to minister with the poor, not just to the poor as a way of bridging the divide.
What Needs Work
1. Metzger's suggestions for changing things are sometimes superficial. He spends way too much effort on critiquing our current church architecture. While I'll be the first to say I love a magnificent cathedral, I do not believe that aesthetic changes (like moving the communion table to the front of the church) will produce the type of transformation Metzger would like to see. The New Testament has little to say about what church architecture should look like. History shows that churches that look like Metzger's proposal have had racial and class distinctions of their own.
2. Metzger is right to insist that we need to take responsibility for humanity's total act of sin, not merely our individual sinfulness. That is why it is valuable for Christians to apologize for the actions of previous generations, for example. But Metzger does not take this as far as he should. If whites should apologize to blacks for previous injustice, so too should blacks apologize for injustice towards whites. The doctrine of original sin means we are all victimizers even as we are victims (a point that Metzger affirms, only he tends to emphasize the white's reponsibility more than the black's). What we need is an atmosphere of mutual grief and repentance toward one another.
Overall, Consuming Jesus is a book I highly recommend. Metzger's book calls us to rethink the current structures of the church and he offers an "all-consuming" vision of the Kingdom which should work its way out into our local congregations and communities.

Chock full of useful insights into the music business
(I know Amazon's preference algorithms are going to bombard me with gay titles now that I'm reviewing this book, but they'll just have to learn how to hit the broad side of a barn someday.)
I am halfway through the soft-bound version of this book, and I am enjoying Jon's honesty, earnestness, and especially the generosity of his insights into the music business. He also shares candidly his choices about musical style, lyric content, and performance venue.
This is a very useful book for any songwriter, band, artist, who wants a clear perspective on putting together an act, how to sell music in the changing marketplace, and on how social and political trends can be harnessed to maximize their success.

Jon Ginoli may not have been the bestlooking guy in rock and roll, nor the most talented musician, but he was cute and aggressive and a fantastic lyricist, and the success of Pansy Division never spoiled his basically right-on attitude.Nowadays it's hard to recreate all the handicaps an openly gay rock band faced in the late 80s, early 90s when Pansy Division was playing local shows like crazy.Even in San Francisco, straight kids were sometimes hostile and, when they were "tricked" into listening to the band at a show, could get upset and show it.For Ginoli & Co were nothing if not in your face.
His memoir, DEFLOWERED, accelerates this Rabelaisian mode, showing us that he was a late bloomer in a way; late to act on his nascent sexual feelings; late to leave the area where he had grown up; late to put together a band that would serve his vision.But once he had it all together, that pentup energy found expression, and at the exact time that would be most propitious for him, during the so-called homocore days when, in the wake of ACT UP and Queer Nation, it really seemed as though a new gay and lesbian culture was being born and even better, conquering the world.
It might not have always been easy dealing with Ginoli (and his right hand man, guitarist Chris Freeman), since the narrative arc in DEFLOWERED is consistently about badmouthing every drummer they play with.But he's so great one forgives him all the things he leaves out of this otherwise hard-hitting and fascinating tour through your pants.
This will someday be regarded as a punk rock classic!
Back in the early 90s, Pansy Division revolutionized punk rock by being the first openly queer punk band, thus giving birth to the queercore movement. In Jon Ginoli's riveting memoir, we hear about his early activism with with ACT-UP and Queer Nation, forming Pansy Division, going on tour with Green Day, confronting homophobic audiences, performing at Pride events around the country, doing benefit shows, challenging censors, touring across the US, Canada, Europe, Australia and New Zealand, and, yes, his sexual adventures. Combining radical queer politics with humor, passion, and righteous anger, Pansy Division's confrontational and sexually explicit lyrics are both a celebration of gay male sexuality and an attack on Moral Majority conservatives. They also hold accountable right-wing queers for their body fascism and embrace of consumerism. Like their music, Ginoli's book is a fun, rollicking experience. Whether you're a long-time fan of Pansy Division or just someone who really enjoys good punk literature or gay male memoirs, I encourage you to read this fabulous book!
A GREAT Read
How many people really get to live their dream?Jon and his bandmates sure do, and their dream was not necessarily to get wealthy or famous.This fascinating and amusing tale gives you a look at their real accomplishment, to make a true honest living, being who they want to be, against tremendous pressures of all sorts.
It is a great inspiration - to succeed according to your own measure and to have a hell of a great time doing it.I've rediscovered their music and picked up their new stuff, and I must say the music and this book never fail to delight.Jon and company are heroes to more people than they will ever know.
You will love this book. I sure did.

It's been a Pansy Division week for me. I received both the DVD, "Life in a Gay Rock Band" and "Deflowered", the book by the band's founder, Jon Ginoli. I have already reviewed the film so I will concentrate on the book here. I have long been a fan of "Pansy Division" as I admire them for singing about the things they do and I believe they have a positive influence of our community. Jon Ginoli shows us his pride in his memoirs here and as you can imagine his road to success was not easy. The book looks at two different aspects of his life--the recording industry and being gay and out.
Ginoli was born in Illinois and he grew up there but it was not until the got to college that the idea of having a gay band actually became a reality. In his book he takes us with him on his journey of self-discovery as well as his passion for music. What is interesting about his passion for music is that it led him to write songs like "Queer to the Core", "Fem in Black Leather Jacket" and many others that amazon.com would not welcome me to write here.
Pansy Division was and still is the first out and proud queer band to go big time but it was a struggle to get to that point. Jon together with Chris Freeman worked their "buns" off to get to be where they are.
Ginoli is a good writer and his book reads smoothly. I felt as if I was with the guys as they forged their way and I have a sense of pride that they made it.
It is hard not to repeat what I said in my review of the film because the two are so similar and both are great. Get them both and be twice as knowledgeable---then drop them a line at

Great WW 2 US divisional history
Summary: This is a limited edition reprint of this exceptional U.S. World War 2 divisional history. of the 106th Regiment participated in the attack on Eniwetok Atoll, 19-26 February 1944, returning to Oahu in March. During this mission, one battalion landed unopposed on Majuro Island, 1 February, and completed its seizure, 3 February. The Division began preparations for the Marianas operations, 15 March. On D-day plus 1, 16 June 1944, elements landed at night on Saipan to support the Second and Fourth Marines. A bridgehead was established and Aslito Airfield captured, 18 June. Fighting continued throughout June. During a pitched battle, 7 July, Japanese overran elements of the Division in a banzai attack, but organized resistance was crushed the next day. During the months of July and August, the 27th cleaned out isolated pockets in the mountains and cliffs of Saipan. Beginning in the middle of August, the Division moved to the New Hebrides for rest and rehabilitation. On 25 March 1945, the 27th sailed from Espiritu Santo, arriving at Okinawa, 9 April 1945. The Division participated in the XXIV Corps general attack, 19 April 1945, securing a dominating ridge line south of Machinato and Kakazu. Machinato Airfield was captured, 28 April, after a severe struggle. On 1 May, the Division was relieved by the 1st Marine Division and attached to the Island Command for garrison duty. Tori Shima was seized, 12 May, without opposition. The 27th attacked from the south end of Ishikawa Isthmus to sweep the northern sector of Okinawa. The enemy fought bitterly on Onnatake Hill from 23 May until 2 June, before losing the strong point. After a mopping-up period, the Division left Okinawa, 7 September 1945, moved to Japan and occupied Niigata and Fukushima Prefectures. 2001 new hard bound reprint of 1949 edition, no dj as issued, division patch embossed in color on cover, 6x9, viii, 710 pages, numerous maps, and a photo section.
For My Father
The 27th Infantry Division was the first and only square division sent to the Pacific theater after Pearl Harbor. Formed within the New York National Guard during the Civil War and nick-named "the O'Ryan Division" after its famed World War I commander, elements of the 27th Infantry Division fought in nearly every island campaign against the Japanese during World War II. While most people think of the Pacific theater as the Marines' war; the U.S. Army was there, too. The 27th Infantry Division was the first Army unit sent in and the last to be sent home from the Pacific. This book is not the romantic, entertaining story that one might expect. Instead, it is a matter-of-fact historical account of the men, their units, and their war. It is a compilation of detailed unit records, painstakingly gathered and recorded for posterity.Some of it is the story of my father, Pfc. Abraham Wesley Kent, Company K, 105th Infantry Regiment, 27th Infantry Division, who fought on Saipan and Okinawa. Although he is not mentioned by name, I have been able to glean some information as to what he and his comrades went through, the battles, the firefights, and the terror that is war. The book leaves nothing out, including the bitter disputes between the Army and Marines commanders on Saipan. I found the book fascinating, and full of information that should help me learn more about my father and what he went endured. It is said that people who advocate going to war probably never fought one. Reading this book will help you to understand why.

On December 28, 2013, ISLE and the Purple Cat were fortunate to acquire a unique work of art from local artist, Daniel Horne.
The “Joe Gallagher Bell” is now on display at Farmer Casey’s Ranch in Coitsville, Ohio. This interactive art was created on commission by the employees of ISLE Inc. and the Purple Cat. The employees approached Daniel and asked him to create a work of art inspired by Joe Gallagher, ISLE’s first client. Daniel initially was going to create a work in metals that resembled Joe but, instead went in a totally different direction with the bell.
The bell is created in metal, with a recycled tank serving as the head, shoulder, and waist of the bell. A recycled banister post serves as an outside clapper. “Little does Daniel know, that Joe Gallagher was once expelled from the St. Columba school for ringing their bell while school was still in session,” explained Jimmy Sutman. “I love that all of our folks, including our friends in wheelchairs will now be able to ring a bell in Joe’s honor.”August 12, 2018 Swenson, Patrick Tagged: Author | Editor (1958- ) US editor, publisher and author, founder of Fairwood Press in 2000, which he continues to run and for which he designed many covers.

This actually contributes more to man assault on physical environment which has strong relationship with natural disaster. Available data revealed that the world has witnessed an increase in the frequency and severity of natural disasters in the last two decades particularly in developing countries. This has manifested by way of destroying crops and livestock, reducing incomes and consumption, and forcing households to liquidate assets. Against this background, this paper aims to answer if natural disasters occurring across the country over the years for which there are records actually affected poverty. The result of findings revealed that natural disasters reduce human development and increase poverty in term of human and materials loss. A proactive natural disaster preventive management measures are finally recommended as lasting solution to the occurrence of disasters in Nigeria to ameliorate poverty

In this paper, we present a Differential Evolution (DE) method and apply it to two problems of optimal power flow (OPF) and the economic load dispatch (ELD) with Valve-Point effects in Power Systems. In the first case, the standard IEEE 30-bus network is tested and its solution is compared to the ones solved by Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO), Genetic Algorithm (GA), Ant Colony Optimization (ACO) methods. For the second one, the NPSO is tested on 13-unit, 40-unit system and validated by comparing results with classical evolutionary programming (CEP), improved fast evolutionary programming (IFEP), improved particle swarm optimization (IPSO) and efficient particle swarm optimization (EPSO) methods. The numerical results are illustrated in many Figures and Tables. It has shown that the proposed method is better than the others in terms of total fuel costs, total loss and computational times.

Analogous to market micro structures the purpose of 'strategic networks' is to leverage specialization, and their objective is to efficiently allocate transformational resources, and optimize support through information. Unlike the merely opportunistic market interdependencies, however, strategic networks are additionally defined by intentional long-term relationships between firms and other types of participant in the environment through co-opetition and collaboration. The purpose of this paper is to examine the influence of such strategic networking (SN) on firm performance of Croatian service SMEs, one of a dozen small 'balkanized', still-transitioning economies resulting of an intense social, political, and economic Central and Eastern European transformation and reconfiguration, particularly pronounced over the span of the last three decades. Financial and non-financial indicators were used in order to more precisely clarify the multidimensional aspect of the SN-performance relationship. The external environment was assessed in terms of turbulence, hostility and dynamism; furthermore its effect as a moderator was tested. The results yield some significantly new elements necessary for understanding the role of SN for the performance of service SMEs in a developing country.

As cloud computing is gaining more recognition as a public utility which gives the client room to focus on his work without focusing on installation and maintenance of other important devices, as they are installed and maintained by the cloud service providers. Cloud computing is meant to be scalable, and enhance the quality of service (QoS), cost effective and also simplified user interface so that the customer can appreciate the idea behind cloud computing. In dealing with resource allocation, the client's request has to be execute through various stages, in case there are queue of requests waiting to be served in each stage. Therefore, queuing methods are required to solve this kind of situation. In this paper, we focused on mathematical formulation using queuing system technique to show how throughput and time delay of a system may varies between a single server system and a multiple server system in a cloud-computing environment.

Although cooperation and consensus is important in gaining employee buy - in to the program, ultimately it is the leadership and commitment from management that drives the process. The audit will assess the level of leadership and commitment to health and safety within the organization to evaluate the program. Despite the value to employers and workers in terms of injuries prevented and cost saved, many factories have not yet adopted injury and illness prevention programs that workers safety. Based on the positive experience of employers with existing programs, it believe that injury and illness prevention programs provide the foundation for breakthrough changes in the way employers identify and control hazards, leading to significantly improved overall workplace health and safety environments. Adoption of injury and illness prevention program will result in both improved workers safety and workers suffering fewer injuries, illnesses and fatalities.

This paper reports the design construction, simulation and testing of a 300W wind battery charger. The design was carried out based on long term available wind data for Jos at 10m height. The average wind speed for Jos is 5.24m/s and rated turbine wind speed is 6.29m/s. The designed components of the system were carefully constructed in a well-equipped workshop. The system was coupled and installed at a height of about 22m. The system was test run and the results recorded for a period of time on two consecutive days. A second degree polynomial was used to model the system power output between cut in and rated wind speeds. The calculated outputs were compared with the actual outputs and a root mean square error of 8.98% was found, showing that the closeness of fit of the calculated outputs to the actual characteristics of the wind-powered turbines is satisfactory. The average system efficiency between cut-in and rated wind speeds was determined to be 38.16%.
Information security is of great concern these days due to the activities of hackers and malicious users on the Internet. Securing information has become a critical issue and is of growing concern as computer systems worldwide become increasingly vulnerable to the rapid increase in the volume of information being transmitted across networks and over the Internet. In this paper, we proposed a technique that provides a robust intrusion detection system against attackers. It puts scalability and appropriate security in mind. The framework is made up of a Network Intrusion Detection System (NIDS) for detection of traffic to and from a given network or sub network, a Host based Intrusion Detection System (HIDS) and a line for possible Intrusion Prevention Systems (IPS). The technique is implemented by modeling network using OPNET, a network simulation software; since a real life implementation is very costly. Our result shows that the technique provides an intrusion detection system that can be used to monitor user's activities on the Internet and other networks with relatively minimal false alarms.

Additives are used as lubricant fortifiers against thermal and thermooxidative degradation under tribological conditions. However some additives can decompose at very high engine temperature regimes into products that may pose serious threats to the environment, if unchecked. For instance ZDDP in spite of its tribological importance as a powerful antioxidant and anti wear additive in automotive crankcase oils, has been suspected as a precursor of environmental hazards due to its perceived tendency to cause electrolytic corrosion and poisoning of the catalysts in the exhaust gas converter. It is against this backdrop that the automobile manufacturers have called for a change from ZDDP to some other antiwear additive or at least reduce its concentration from the present 0.08 to 0.05%. This review is therefore aimed at allaying the fears of exhaust catalyst poisoning which could result in emission of toxic exhaust fumes into the environment. The mechanism of thermooxidative degradation showing the expected products has been proposed to address this apprehension. The study also collaborates the views of the lube oil producers that 0.08% of ZDDP in lube oils is ideal for optimum performance of the automotive crankcase engines and that this concentration has no adverse environmental implications to warrant a call for reduction or an outright ban.
KEYWORDS: Antiwear Additive, ZDDP, Degradation Products, Environmental Concern
This research work is on the determination of the cost of production from the raw dung to the final output of biogas. The main objective of this work is to obtain the amount that will be spent for the production of the biogas. The materials used include the following: digester tank, raw cow dung, outlet valve, inlet valve, pressure gauge, thermometer, bolts and nuts, burner, hose and water. The procedure exploited in the production of biogas cow dung is through anaerobic digestion. The result obtained showed that about thirty thousand Naira was spent to produce one hundred and fifty (150) litres of biogas. In order words, a litre costs six Naira. In conclusion, private sectors should embrace the production of biogas from cow dung as an alternative energy for domestic cooking because it is cheaper than any other energy usually used for cooking and doing some other things. Also, the raw material that is cow dung is readily available in some places.
KEY WORDS: Biogas, cow dung, anaerobic digestion, Alternative energy, and Biomass
This paper presents a study of different environment friendly refrigerants with zero ozone depletion potential (ODP) and negligible global warming potential (GWP), to replace R134a in domestic refrigerator. This work consists of using a hydrocarbon gas mixture which does not deplete ozone layer, is eco friendly, and can be used in the commonly used refrigerators without any significant change in the system. A refrigerator designed and developed to work with R134a was tested, and its performance using HC-12a was evaluated and compared with its performance when R134a was used. The condenser temperature and evaporator temperature, COP, refrigerating effect, condenser duty, work of compression and heat rejection of water were investigated. The energy consumption of the refrigerator during experiment with hydrocarbons and R-134a was measured. The results obtained showed that the alternative refrigerant investigated in experimental performance HC-12a have higher coefficient of performance and less energy consumption. The design temperature and pull-down time set by International Standard Organization (ISO) for small refrigerator were achieved earlier using refrigerant HC-12a than using R-134a. Due to a higher value of latent heat of HCs, the amount of refrigerant charge was also reduced as compared with HFC-134a. The COP and other result obtain in this experiment shows a positive indication of using mixed refrigerant as refrigerants in household refrigerator. The performance of HC-12a in the domestic refrigerator was constantly better than those of R134a throughout all the operating conditions, which shows that HC-12a can be used as replacement for R134a in domestic refrigerator. Refrigerant physical and chemical properties of different refrigerants are included in this paper. This paper also discuses on the C.O.P (coefficient of performance) and RE (Refrigeration Effect).

Experiments were conducted to investigate the correlation of soil properties towards metal loss of API 5L X42 carbon steel coupons, with emphasis on soil pH and resistivity. A total of four pieces of X42 coupons were placed in four different soil samples gotten from four different states within the Niger Delta region for 2352 hours, to study the influence of soil properties towards metal loss via weight loss method. The soil coupons were buried in the soil samples placed in a plastic container, allowed to corrode naturally and then retrieved every 168 hours. The influence of soil pH value and resistivity were evaluated using the weight loss method to evaluate the corrosion rate on coupons in the different soil samples. Results showed that that both parameters had an influence on buried steel but soil resistivity had a dominating influence compared to soil pH.

This work specifically investigated the corrosion rates of API 5L X42 steel in NaCl, Na2SO4 and Na2CO3 environments maintained at different concentrations with a view to determining the most aggressive environment that should be avoided or deserved highly protected pipeline. Weight loss technique was used in which sample coupons with known weight were totally immersed in a non flowing media of NaCl, Na2SO4 , Na2CO3 for a total exposure time of 1008 hours. The experimental results showed that the corrosiveness of carbon steel in 1.0M of Na2CO3 was highest which was mainly a function of its higher concentration based on the fact that no film was formed on the coupon, followed by 0.5M solution of NaCl while the least was recorded in 1.0M solution of Na2SO4. Conclusively it was proven that the lower the concentration in media capable of forming oxide film round the coupon like in NaCl, and Na2SO4 media, the higher the corrosion rate. While for environments which do not aid in film formation such as Na2CO3, the higher the concentration, the higher the corrosion rate. As such carbon steels would fail fastest in an environment where the concentration of Na2CO3 solution is high.
KEYWORDS – API 5L X42 carbon steel, corrosion, coupon, environment, immersion.
Power factor is a measure of how efficiently, electrical power is consumed. This paper presents the development of a power factor model for power system loads to establish the effect of power factor correction (PFC) on the electrical distribution network of Lever Brothers Nigeria PLC. Measured data were taken on the distribution network before and after the installation of the PFC capacitors. The data which includes power factors, active power, reactive power, apparent power and current were used as input parameters for the development of a polynomial PF model of order 3.The result of the model reveals a power factor improvement from 0.5671 to 0.9693 after the installation of the PFC capacitors. Analysis of the model can be used to reduce the cost of electric power production and increases the capacity and efficiency of the electrical power systems.

This weekend during their performance at Audacy’s 8th annual We Can Survive show at the Hollywood Bowl, Chris Martin and his crew welcomed a member of the pop group to the stage for the UK pop crossover moment of the year. After letting fans know it’s been a dream of his to perform with the Spice Girls for years now, Martin surprised the audience with a performance of “2 Become 1” with Mel C.
According to Martin, he only asked the former Spice Girl that morning if she’d join him onstage, but she did oblige, and sounded pretty fresh for such short notice. During the show at the Hollywood Bowl, Shawn Mendes and The Black Eyed Peas, Doja Cat, Maroon 5, Saweetie, and The Kid Laroi also gave performances. But did any of them have a Spice Girl showing up just to do one of the band’s most beloved hits? Well, no, they didn’t. Check out the unexpected duet above, and if you haven’t yet, definitely listen to Coldplay’s collaboration with BTS on “My Universe.”

In Greece, the political pendulum has often swung from one extreme to the other – at great cost to the country. When the 1967-74 dictatorship fell, it was imperative to purge the country’s civil protection and security forces and make them more transparent. Over the years, however, this process went off the rails and the forces came to be run by political and unionist power centers. Discipline and respect for the hierarchy, which had already been seriously damaged by the junta, fell by the wayside, along with accountability.
The findings of an investigation into the deadly fires of last July in eastern Attica are evidence of the tragic consequences of this phenomenon, of the fact that a large chunk of the country’s civil protection authorities are ailing from the same failures that plague Greece’s public enterprises. Positions of responsibility are filled with people who are unqualified and unable to handle any crisis. Officers who are trained in special fields are transferred to irrelevant jobs because achieving professional excellence is seen as a sin. The absence of discipline, meanwhile, makes a mockery of the chain of command, which is so crucial during a crisis. And this is just the tip of the iceberg.
Unfortunately, this phenomenon is not restricted to the fire service. In the navy, for example, performance reviews were diligently carried out for many years until they too started falling by the wayside in recent years as a result of political interventions. The mentality of shirking responsibility and letting bad behavior go unchecked became prevalent. People in the know claim that it was this mentality that was responsible for one or two unfortunate incidents in recent years that were reported in the media.
When a bomb nearly killed a former prime minister, meanwhile, there was a concerted effort to prevent any blame from falling on the shoulders of the guards who failed to properly inspect a booby-trapped parcel. This is but one example of what has become a culture of abolishing operating procedures in services that are such a vital part of the state apparatus. This phenomenon has snowballed since SYRIZA came to power in 2015 because the leftist party lowered performance standards even further and sanctioned the abuse of democratic freedoms. But it was born long before that.
The danger now is that efforts to completely destroy structure and discipline ahead of the national election will become more deliberate and intense. It will take a great deal of effort to keep the pendulum swinging close to the center so that we can have some degree of certainty that tragedies like that of last July will not happen again.Create a free profile to get unlimited access to exclusive videos, sweepstakes, and more!
Melissa Gorga Teases "Big Moments" Next Season of RHONJ
The RHONJ cast member was joined by Joe Gorga on WWHL and dropped a Season 12 teaser.
Kyle Richards and Kathy Hilton may have been the main guests on Wednesday's (September 29) episode of Watch What Happens Live with Andy Cohen to dish about all things The Real Housewives of Beverly Hills, but a Real Housewife from the East Coast also made an appearance in the Clubhouse. Melissa Gorga was in the audience to partake in all the fun.
The Real Housewives of New Jersey cast member wasn't just hanging out, though; she was also there to spill some tea. Melissa was asked by host Andy Cohen for any intel on Season 12 of RHONJ. And, she delivered.
"[It's] pretty crazy. I think we have some moments. I'm gonna be [honest]. There's definitely big moments. Big moments, I'm sure you've heard about them," Melissa told Andy.
Does Joe Gorga agree? You can press play on the WWHL clip, above.
When she wasn't sharing some info on the new season, Melissa was having a blast hanging out with Kathy, Kyle, and Andy, as evidenced by a photo she shared to Instagram. "Everything is just Hunky Dory," she captioned the moment as a nod to one of Kathy's memorable lines from Season 11 of RHOBH.
OK, so, back to all things RHONJ. Slowly, we've been learning more about the upcoming season. Back in July, Dolores Catania popped up in the Bravo Clubhouse as an audience member as well. At the time, both she and Andy described the new season as "hot." Dolores shared another tidbit to get fans excited, noting, "You're gonna have a lot to talk about."
When Margaret Josephs appeared on Bravo's Chat Room in August, she also shared a tantalizing teaser. "I'm just gonna tell you, you girls are gonna absolutely love it," she told Bravo's Chat Room co-hosts Porsha Williams and Gizelle Bryant. "Jersey crazy at its finest.".Register Now !

Translation and purport composed by disciples of Śrīla Prabhupāda
TRANSLATION
Simply by glancing at those who came to see Him, Lord Kṛṣṇa, the spiritual master of the three worlds, delivered them from the blindness of materialism. As He thus endowed them with fearlessness and divine vision, He heard demigods and men singing His glories, which purify the entire universe and destroy all misfortune. Gradually, He reached Videha.
PURPORT
Śrīla Jīva Gosvāmī raises the logical question of how the ordinary people along the path could even see the Lord, since not only were their eyes covered by ignorance, but the Lord's chariot was traveling faster than the wind. Supplying the answer, Śrīla Jīva indicates that Lord Kṛṣṇa's special glance of mercy empowered every one of them with the devotional purity required for entering into His association. Otherwise, He would have remained outside the scope of their power to see, as He Himself states in His instructions to Uddhava: bhaktyāham ekayā grāhyaḥ. "I can be perceived only by devotion." (SB 11.14.21) By the grammatical rule of compound formation known as eka-śeṣa, the term sta-vīkṣaṇa-vinaṣṭa-tamisra-dṛgbhyaḥ, although in its primary sense inflected as a masculine noun, may be understood in this context as referring to both men and women.FeaturesPeople Daily
Setting family goals for the New Year
For many of us, it’s that time to take stock of our lives, writing down individual and collective resolutions. Having a target as a family ensures success in marriage and life in general. We look at action plans some have planned to undertake
Grace Wachira @yaa_grace
It’s that time of the year again and people are setting goals for 2019. They are penning their personal goals down and mapping them out on sticky notes stuck by their beds or desks.
Even then, families too are having round-table discussions about how to live this year whilst some parents already had closed-door meetings. We take a look at some resolutions families make as a unit.
Moving houses
For a long time Peninah Waiguru and her family have been living in Nairobi’s Pangani estate. But in the New Year, she and her husband have decided to make good their dream. “When we got married, we moved into a two-bedroomed house in Pangani.
Now that we have our two children who are in upper primary school, we have decided to move into our own house,” she smiles. Having saved up and developed their piece of land in Ruai for the past two years, the family starts their year with a new resolve, to start the next phase of their lives in their four-bedroom house.
While some families move into their own property, there are those that will move into bigger spaces as part of New Year’s resolution. Others intend to redecorate their houses or buy new furniture.
A new set of wheels
This is definitely something families aspire to do and what better time to replace a car or purchase one than at the beginning of a new year. Having raised their three children and relying on friends, family and even cabs to run their family errands, George Bosibori has purposed to get his family a car.
“I love that my wife has been understanding. We have had to use public means at times to rush to hospital or forego trips and outings because we do not have a car,” he says.
All the same, George is confident he and his family would continue to enjoy quality time away from home once he gets them their own ride. “It is something my children long for and talk about and my wife and I are ready to add onto our responsibilities,” he says.
Changing schools
This may sound a bit cliché, but numerous families across the world always have a change of schools as part of their New Year agenda. It could be that children are done with kindergarten and now need to attend primary school. Or a school has not been as forthcoming as far as performance is concerned.
Or finances have factored in and they need to go to a more affordable school or a better school. Some are ready to join high school or college. “We already went for the interviews early December last year and my children were accepted to their new school,” beams Sophia Auko, a mother of two who resides in Nairobi.
It is something she has always wanted and now, the single mother will have her children admitted to a prestigious school she had longed for her children to study in.
Lay off the help
Laying of the house help is a big decision. It calls for some major adjustments. “My children are now young adults. They don’t like being called teenies,” Felister Wanja laughs.
“They are of age now. We needed the help when they couldn’t do their laundry and to help keep the house clean,” she says. But now, her teenagers can do the laundry themselves and have made good attempts at preparing dinner. I know the idea of not having their auntie will not be welcomed, but they will accept it with time. Their father and I need them to be responsible.
We will just get them their own sets of house keys and a meal timetable. Even we as their parents will have to adjust, we will need to schedule when to do tasks that were previously carried out by her. She was great at her job so, we will miss her,” she says. Felister is also excited that it will save the household some money.Rachel Maddow hosts town hall on Flint water crisis

The Philippine Institute of Volcanology and Seismology (Philvolcs) said the quake occurred at 2:58 a.m., accompanied by a rumbling sound audible at Monbon village in Irosin town.
"(But) the explosion was not observed because the volcano summit was covered by thick clouds. Field investigation conducted this morning confirmed the presence of traces of ash deposits in Monbon, Irosin," Phivolcs said on its website on Tuesday.
Phivolcs said Bulusan's alert level remains at "1." The alert level had been at "1" since November last year.

The Philippine Institute of Volcanology and Seismology (Phivolcs) said signs of unrest were detected in Mayon, Taal, and Bulusan volcanoes during its 24-hour observation.
Phivolcs reported having observed one rock fall at Mayon Volcano in Albay and its steam was white and moderate.
Meanwhile, crater glow was not observed due to thick clouds covering Mayon's summit.
"Results of ground deformation surveys conducted last November and December 2010 showed that the volcanic edifice remains inflated based on 2008 baseline data," the Phivolcs said.
Alert Level 1 has been raised due to Mayon's current activity.
While no eruption is imminent, Phivolcs strongly prohibited the public from wandering within the six-kilometer radius permanent danger zone (PDZ) due to the continuing threat from sudden small explosions and rock falls from the upper and middle slopes of the volcano.

The Muslim World, chiefly Arab, celebrates the End Time Coming more zealously than even the Bible Belt Southern Baptists who feel they celebrate the same thing. The first difference is that Islam demands to be the “protagonist in favor of peace”.
What neither Islamists nor the World are willing to admit is that every scriptural quotation flaunted by Islam was stolen from Biblical texts. More likely, the truth would be that even Islamists, let alone Western Infidels, simply do not know and besides do not care.
Mohammed was illiterate and paid Jews and Gnostics to recite to him texts drawn from the Old Testament and the New Testament of the Bible plus Apocrypha, which were popular among some Jews and Christians in Mohammed’s day. Mohammed neither understood the Biblical texts nor cared likely for their meaning. There was a time in his life when he conceded ‘the People of the Book’ had a certain preeminence but this was long gone by the time he murdered all opposition, physical or intellectual. Hundreds of years later, after the death of Mohammed, those who codified the Q’uran cared even less for the true meaning of scripture but only for their intent: to incorporate scripture to obtain legitimacy for Islam.
The insane and evil rantings of Mohammed after he became the sworn enemy of the Jews and for that matter, of all mankind, were sometimes couched in terms of scraps of scripture that he recalled from earlier days. His ignorance was so great the Jews who recited scripture to him laughed in his face at his complete misinterpretation of their words. They later paid with their lives.
Between one hundred and three hundred years after the death of Mohammed, his followers who had by now subjugated all Arabia and more, gathered and collated (a loose use of the term) what could be called “the Sayings of the Prophet” into what eventually became the present day Q’uran. In fact, there are five books including the Haditha and Commentaries by notable early Islamic scholars. Mohammed wrote none of it and none of it is first hand. All of it is, at best, hand-me-down third party accounts (so-and-so said that so-and-so said that the Prophet said…up to twenty or more times removed) which have no credibility at all. This then was written in a dead language, Classical Arabic, which nobody today speaks. Even those who are able to somewhat interpret the language are confounded by the fact some words no longer exist and no meaning is known for them. On top of this, the collected words and sayings have no actual context and constantly contradict each other. It is forbidden to write or translate the Q’uran into any other language than its original Classical Arabic.
People today who quote from the Q’uran are citing dogma drawn from the original and expressed in modern languages. All of the hatred expressed in Islamist propaganda about destroying the Infidel is drawn from the original. This is in fact the scripture of Islam. The other bits, the nice bits quoted to show Islam is “The Religion of Peace” are scraps of text plagiarized from the Bible. The Q’uran is a Lie and Mohammed was a false prophet.
But yet we see such as this video above, by people who project the words of the true prophets of the Most High, dealing with the fate of Mankind in these latter days, as though they were spoken by Mohammed. The Hebrew prophets saw our day. They accurately described the world in which we live today. Their words have been plagiarized by Islam, one of the churches of satan, so as to confuse the innocent.
The promises of this false prophet regarding a 12th Imam speak more truly of the Coming of another, the Creator God who is Messiah. Aside from that, the promises of fear, destruction and chaos are quite accurate except Islam represents to forces of satan, seeking murder and chaos and destruction.
Islam, with all its promises, is the BIG LIE.
This is not to say Western Capitalism is not also satanic in its corruption of the morals and ethics of mankind. We see this. God has said He will use the wicked to destroy the wicked.
War comes and Islam wants it. Christianity accepts that war cannot be avoided. Rather than exulting in the opportunity to kill and be killed, Christianity teaches, “Be still, and know that I am God.”
War comes and it will be a great test even for the devout believers in The Lamb of God. The Bible states that “even the very elect will be shaken. They will say he has left his coming until too late”.
So the video here speaks a lie. It is intended to deceive Muslims everywhere and to lead them to believe they must be part of the destruction: Jihad. It also is a lie in that, many Westerners will intentionally be misled into thinking Mohammed was in some way wise and truly spoke these promises and sayings which were stolen from the Bible.
In every way, Islam is THE BIG LIE.

How can I use Focusing as a Life Skill?
What is Focusing?
Focusing is based on our inherent ability to sense our body from within and its know-how to access the body-mind wisdom and create its own metaphors. Positive life changes happen when we are able to symbolise the crux of our ongoing experiencing.When we focus on our most complex and challenging "confused" situations/ issues, focusing directly accesses our innermost body-mind intelligence, unravelling and clarifying new, fresh and creative solutions. It is simple but not easy. By its very nature it is subtle and needs specific experiential teaching in order for someone to be able to utilise it to the full whenever and wherever it is needed in their lives.
There are no limits or combinations in the way that focusing can be implemented. It can be used by healing and wellness professionals, therapists, teachers and pedagogues, artists, business and NGO's, conflict resolution and mediation.
What will be the effect of focusing in my life?
Learning to listen to my own inner wisdom
To activate my own natural ability for change
Living with more ease, sparkle and inner satisfaction
Accepting myself and healing my past
The possibility of deepening and expanding my relationships both in life and work.

After a day off we will continue to show you the essence of the legendary Scotland!. Today we take you to Glasgow, which was the second most powerful city of the British Empire in the Victorian era given its industry and population. Today it is still the most populated city in Scotland, doubling Edinburgh in inhabitants in terms of its metropolitan area or "Greater Glasgow" passing the million two hundred thousand inhabitants, the city as such enjoys half of this population. Glasgow, although it is a cosmopolitan city like Edinburgh, is not so much, being the feeling and pride of being Scottish more rooted in general in this great city than in the capital and of more open and simple people given its industrial character. Some of the most important international companies in Scotland are based in Glasgow, but today, we are going to take you to the oldest and most important buildings in the capital and which gave their origin as such.

Of marked European character like that of Edinburgh, it is the fourth oldest in the English-speaking world, being that of Edinburgh the sixth (year XNUMX) from which notable students as writers emerged; Arthur Conan Doyle, Robert Louis Stvenson or Alexander Graham Bell inventor of the telephone among others. The oldest of the Scottish universities is The University of St. Andrews (year 1410) and the third oldest in the entire English-speaking world, here the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge studied among other famous historical figures. If we put together these three universities that we will show you, you have the reason for the significant percentage of Writers and Inventors as well as such famous actors from Scotland in a country as sparsely populated as it is today around five and a half million inhabitants. Returning to the University of Glasgow we take you to the courtyards where scenes from the famous saga have also been filmed Harry Potter such as the interior of Hogwarts castle or scenes from the famous television series about Jacobite Scotland Outlander.

But this is not all; do you know why the flag of Scotland? It is the cross of San Andrés, taken by the arrival of the relics of this apostle in the XNUMXth century to the town of St. Andrews that bears his name and where Golf was born!

I ran some simulation of halos created by hollow columns. Usually, hollow columns are considered to be poor halo makers, reducing the probability of getting rare arcs. I have simulated hollow columns display using Zemax.
Zemax is commercial software used for optical design. Its primary purpose is design and optimization of optical systems. It allows only static simulation, but I wrote a few macros to simulate halos. The main advantages are that you don’t need to compute yourself all the optics laws, just to concentrate on the halos, and it is very flexible software. I have been able to simulate displays from twinned and complex crystals. Its main disadvantage is that it is very slow compared to dedicated software like Halopoint. I have compared the two software and they give the same halos, so the optics inside is really the same. Crystals used to simulate hollow columns keep their crystalline faces for the hollow parts. In real crystals, the holes appear to be more rounded and smooth. The halos simulated are so from ideal hollow columns. Simulation shows that, quite unexpectedly, hollow columns strongly enhance complex arcs in the anthelic direction. For instance, Tricker and subhelic arcs are much more prominent than with regular columns. Marko Riikonen pointed out a display with samples showing lots of hollow columns that had strong Tricker and subhelic arc. Simulations with hollow columns are quite consistent with the display.
I still don’t really figure how these complex raypaths can have increased probability with hollow columns, but simulations definitely show it.
Nicolas Lefaudeux
Quite amazing! Somehow the “inner prismatic” surfaces facilitate these complex raypaths?
Interesting indeed. I guess the effective aspect ratio of the prism is decreased (the prism is shortened) by these additional inside-protruding surfaces, thus increasing Tricker raypath occuring percentage.
btw.: Nice to see haloPoint producing similar results with another software.
Actually I think there is some other mechanism involved than just shortening of the column because even with short columns you get strong but not complete Tricker and subhelic arcs.
I don’t really know how this is happening. It could be a combination of external and internal reflections, or maybe rays somehow traveling inside the thin crown at the edge of crystal.
Nice job Nicolas! We have always been lacking possibility to apply these inner structures for simulations.
Have you tried other possible halo makers like capped columns? Also you should try to make ellipsical halo simulations with that program. There is some unsolved questions about elliptical halos.
Wow interesting here I habe always thought columns with those cavities on the ends would block tricker arc rays rather than enhance them.
Ok, now I am not sure if the hollowed column better reproduces my display concerning the Tricker arc intensity, but what I am more excited about this is the disappearance of “sun cross” in the hollowed crystal simulation. And in general to finally have the first simulations with “inperfect” crystal.
The path with the traditional convex solid single crystals has been traversed through long ago. At first we had only the regular heagons to work with. Then came the possibility to change the crystal face ratios, which provided moments of elightement for a while. But now even that path is pretty much beaten. So the next step is start incorporating truly natural looking crystals in the simulations with their cavities, air bubbles, ridges and depressions. There are already algorithsm that simulate these kind of crystals, perhaps they could be incorporated in the halo simulation programs one day. And of course also the clustered crystals are a new interesting path to follow.
Yeah, it is great work from Lefadeux (as always). I can think of several cases where we could try these “imperfect” crystals.
Thanks! complex crystals are great but however it adds lots of degrees of freedom and so tuning a simulation to match a display is very hard as simulation also take very long (for instance several hours for the complex hollow column on top right, and about one hour for simpler hollow column on lower right)
incorporating bubbles and cavities is very easy using zemax. I have several ideas and simulations in progress, I will share them here when they are more ready to be shown. I’ll also add the capped columns on my “to do” list, others are already on it!
Hello Nicolas, very impressive work! Did you use the same shape for all the hollow columns or some varying inner structure throughout the crystal set? Could you show the region close to sun in more detail? Recently, we have a discussion in the german message board about what we can see there.
Hi Alexander,
I used the same shape crystal for each simulation. The crystal drawn on top is the one used for each simulation. I will try to do a close up simulation of the sun region this week end. I had a look to the german forum, and I don’t think it there is anything of elliptical halo in the sun region. I think it is just artefacts caused by the left/right symmetry in the simulation and the jpg compression.
But a close up simulation will show what is really going on for sure
Nicolas
definitely nothing
These crystals were replicated with Riikonen in 8-9 December 2010. I just photographed some of the crystals as I got my microscope setup running again.
The cavities, pores and other structures will indeed prove a fascinating world to explore!Ontario Government unveils climate change plan
No amount of pleading from scientists, direction from the federal government or even lost revenue can convince Ontario's PC government to bring back cap-and-trade, it seems.
Provincial Environment Minister Rod Phillips made this crystal clear today when revealing the Ford government's long-awaited climate change plan.
"This plan strikes the right balance between a healthy environment and a healthy economy," he said on Thursday. "Most importantly, it does all of this without imposing an ineffective, regressive carbon tax on hard-working Ontario families."
So how does Ontario plan to, as Phillips puts it "do our part to reduce greenhouse gas emissions" without taxing polluters who exceed their carbon allowances?
By offering them money instead.
A visual explanation of the Ontario Carbon Trust as seen in 'Preserving and Protecting our Environment for Future Generations: A Made-in-Ontario Environment Plan'. Image via the Government of Ontario.
Meet the Ontario Carbon Trust—a proposed $400-million fund that would serve to "unleash the resourcefulness and creativity of the private sector while freeing them from burdensome taxes and red tape."
Essentially, a "reverse auction" would allow private sector bidders to send proposals for emissions reduction projects.
Those with the best ideas, as determined by a "board with the appropriate expertise" could win contracts totalling tens or hundreds of millions of dollars.
LIVE: Minister Phillips announces new Made-in-Ontario environment plan.— Rod Phillips (@RodPhillips01) November 29, 2018
The freshly-released, 54-page-long plan says this trust is "most cost-effective approach to reducing greenhouse gas emissions," and that such a trust it would actually help Canada meet its Paris Climate Agreement target
Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau may beg to differ. His government remains locked in a court battle against Ontario and Saskatchewan, both of which refuse to comply with his federal carbon pricing plan.
Of course, the carbon trust is only one part of the plan, which has been posted on the government's Environmental Registry for public input over the next 60 days.
Other ideas for solving climate change, according to Phillips, include tougher penalties for breaking environmental laws, more robust transparency measures and initiatives like a province-wide day of action to fight litter.

An attachment is retrofittably attachable (and detachable) to a conventional hammer to render the hammer head magnetic for purposes of starting a metallic fastener such as a nail. The attachment includes a cup-like housing within which is disposed a magnetic unit that includes at least one magnet. One surface of the magnetic unit magnetically attaches the unit to the striking surface of the hammer head. The head of a metallic fastener is magnetically attachable to the other surface of the magnetic unit.
The invention relates generally to hammers and hammer-like tools, and more specifically to hammers that can magnetically retain a nail or other fastener to the head region of the hammer at a proper angle for driving the nail into a work surface using one hand.BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION
Hammers and hammer-like tools have been known in the art for many centuries, and are used to drive a nail or other fastener into a working surface, e.g., wood, concrete. Hammers comprise a user-holdable handle to which a head is attached. While the handle may be fabricated from a non-metal material such as wood or fiberglass, the hammer head is made from a durable metal. A durable metal, e.g., steel is preferred since the hammer head is used to forcibly strike a typically metal nail or other joining device.
It is a relatively easy task to start a nail into the surface of the material being worked up when the material is not substantially higher than the head of the hobbyist, carpenter, contractor, or other person using the hammer, collectively the “user”. The user simply holds the nail (or other joining device in one hand), and strikes the head of the nail with the head of the hammer, while holding the hammer in the other hand. Once the nail has been struck and is at least partially lodged into the material being worked upon, the user needs only one hand to deliver further hammer blows to drive the nail home.
However starting a nail into a work surface can be rather difficult if the work surface is substantially higher than the user's head. The position to be nailed may be within range of the hammer head but may be slightly beyond reach of the user's free hand. The task of starting a nail into the work surface can be exceedingly difficult when the surface is completely overhead, for example a ceiling to which sheet rock or the like is to be attached. Carpenters using a hammer during a framing operation often need to hold the work surface with one hand, while attempting to use a hammer to start and drive a nail with the other hand.
Such task would be simplified if the nail or other joining device could temporarily be attached to the hammer head, with the sharp end of the nail facing away from the head.
It is known in the art to apply a tacky adhesive to the striking surface of a hammer head, which adhesive can retain the nail at least for the initial hammer blow. Understandably it is necessary not merely to retain the nail to the hammer striking surface, but to retain the nail at a proper starting angle. Adhesives can be messy in practice, and grease, oil, dust and the like on the nails being used can rapidly reduce the effectiveness of the adhesive. A nail that has detached itself from a hammer head may cause injury to nearby persons.
More preferably, magnetic hammer heads are known in the art. For example, USP 4,073,327 to Pearson (1978) disclosed a modified hammer head in which a central portion of the original head is removed and replaced by a magnetic material. USP 3,580,312 to Hallock (1971) disclosed another configuration in which the ferrous head of a conventional hammer includes at least chamber formed at right angles to the striking surface. A permanent magnet is sealed within each chamber to magnetize the hammer head.
Note that magnetic hammers such as disclosed by Pearson and Hallock are essentially dedicated hammers in that the magnetic feature is always present, at least until the magnetism is lost. Stated differently, it is not feasible to instantly render a Pearson or Hallock hammer non-magnetic, then render it magnetic, then non-magnetic, and so forth, depending upon the nature of the task at hand.
Although prior art magnetic hammer heads are useful for starting nails in difficult to reach locations, especially ceilings, dedicated hammer heads such as disclosed by Pearson and Hallock have certain disadvantages. The repeated impact of the magnetized hammer head against nails can result in a loss of magnetism in the hammer head. Since the above-described prior art hammers use a dedicated hammer head, e.g., a head that has been permanently modified or manufactured to be magnetic, it will eventually be necessary to replace the entire hammer head. But magnetic hammer heads are expensive to replace. Further, replacing a hammer head involves forcibly removing the head from the hammer end of the handle, typically by digging out a metal wedge that is driven into the handle end. Replacing the hammer head more than once or twice can require replacing the handle as well, as the region into which the wedge is driven will soon weaken.
But even if replacing a dedicated magnetic hammer head were inexpensive and easy, and such is not the case, the user may not always want the hammer head to be magnetic. For example in many applications there will be no need for a magnetic hammer head. Yet if the user were to inadvertently drop the hammer head into a box of nails, the result would be that many nails would be magnetically attached to the hammer head. The user would then have to waste time removing all but perhaps one of the nails. Further a magnetic hammer head could be a disadvantage when working in an area that might be sensitive to magnetism. For example if the magnetic hammer were used in a computer room where storage diskettes were near the work surface, there is a possibility that data stored on the diskettes might become corrupted. Obviously such potential risk would not exist if the hammer head were not magnetic.
Thus, there is a need for a mechanism that can render the head of a hammer magnetic when desired, but non-magnetic otherwise. Preferably such mechanism should be retrofittably useable with existing hammer heads without requiring modification to the original hammer head. Finally, there is a need for such mechanism that can be inexpensively and readily fabricated, and that can be used even by laypersons.
The present invention provides such a mechanism.SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION
The invention is a mechanism that comprises a tube-like housing sized to fit, preferably retrofittably, over at least the striking surface portion of a hammer head, and a magnetic unit within the housing. One end of the magnetic unit magnetically secures the mechanism to the striking surface of a hammer, while the other end of the magnetic unit can magnetically retain the head of a nail or other fastener that is to be hammered into a working surface.
The tube-like housing preferably is a non-magnetic material such as copper, aluminum, durable plastic. A sleeve-like region of the housing will fit over at least part of the hammer head striking surface, and is retained in position by the magnetic unit disposed within the housing. The magnetic unit may comprise a single magnet having a first end that can serve as a magnetic striking surface, and having a second end that magnetically contacts the striking surface of the hammer head. Preferably the first and second ends of the magnetic unit will present planar outer surfaces. If desired the magnetic unit may comprise a plurality of magnets, for example a readily replaceable disk magnet at the second end of the unit, and one or more magnets at the first end of the unit, all of the magnets being magnetically in contact with each other.
A conventional (non-magnetic) hammer is rendered magnetic simply by attaching the tube-like housing over at least the striking surface portion of the hammer head. The housing helps frictionally attach and align the mechanism to the hammer head, but primarily it is magnetism from the second end of the magnetic unit that secures the mechanism in place. The mechanism will remain in place until pulled off the hammer head by the user.
Understandably with the mechanism in place, the otherwise conventional hammer is now rendered magnetic, and will so remain until the mechanism is removed from the hammer head by the user. Head of metal nails, screws, staples and other fasteners may be magnetically attached to the first end of the magnetic unit will be retained magnetically until forcibly started into the work surface by a blow from the hammer. In this fashion, a person using the hammer may thus begin to hammer a fastener into a work surface without having to hold the fastener with one hand.
When it is not required that the hammer be magnetic, the user simply pulls the mechanism away off the hammer head, and the hammer is once more a conventional, non-magnetic, hammer. But when a magnetic head is required, the mechanism is simply reattached, and so on.
Other features and advantages of the invention will appear from the following description in which the preferred embodiments have been set forth in detail, in conjunction with the accompanying drawings.BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS

FIG. 2 is a perspective view showing the present invention attached to a conventional hammer head and with a fastener magnetically attached to the present invention;
FIG. 3A is a spaced-apart cross-sectional view of a first embodiment of the present invention;

FIG. 1 shows a prior art hammer 10 that comprises a metal hammer head 20 attached to the striking end of a handle 30. As shown, a portion of hammer head 20 is typically formed with a planar striking surface 40. In normal use, a user would hold hammer 10 by handle 30 and strike a nail or other fastener with striking surface 40.
FIG. 1 depicts the present invention 50, spaced-apart from hammer 10. As will be described with respect to FIG. 2, the head of a nail or other fastener 60 is magnetically attached to striking surface 70 of the invention. Invention 50 includes a tube-like housing 80, within which is disposed a magnetic unit 90 that comprises at least one magnet. Striking surface 70 represents one end of magnetic unit 90, and a planar region 100, within housing 80, represents a second end of unit 90. The present invention 50 is attached to at least striking surface 40 of the hammer head primarily by magnetic attraction between planar region 100 of unit 90 and the metal striking surface 40. The portion of tube-like housing 80 adjacent hammer 10 is sized to fit collar-like around at least a portion of the head, such that striking surface 20 fits within housing 80 and magnetically engages with region 100 of magnetic unit 80.
Turning now to FIG. 2, mechanism 50 has been moved rightward by a user (not shown) such that the collar portion of housing 80 fits over the striking end of the hammer head to encompass at least a side distance L of perhaps 0.25″ (60 mm) or more. Hammer-facing end of housing 80 presents a cup-like configuration enabling mechanism 50 to fit over at least the striking portion 40 of the hammer head, with magnetism from unit 80 magnetically retaining the present invention to the metal hammer head.
Housing 80 is made of a durable but preferably non-magnetic material, e.g., copper or aluminum, although other materials including magnetic materials could be used. Housing 80 may have a uniform cross-section, although the embodiment shown in the figures has a reduced striking region cross-section, as a result of the process by which a prototype unit was made. A user can simply hold the handle 30 of hammer 10 with one hand, attach the head of a metallic nail, screw, staple, or other fastener 60 to the magnetic striking surface 70 of unit 80, and proceed to nail the fastener into a work surface using but one hand. Should the user then wish to dip the hammer end into a container of fasteners, the fasteners would only attach to the magnetic surface 70, rather than also to collar-like shell of housing 50 or to the metal hammer head 20. All but one of the fasteners would then be removed, or one fastener only would be attached by the user to surface 70, and hammering would continue.
FIG. 3A is a breakaway cross-section of a first embodiment of the present invention. In FIG. 3A, mechanism 50 includes a multi-element magnetic unit 90, and includes a separate striking surface element 110. A bifurcated housing is shown, comprising housing portions 80A and 80B. In the embodiment depicted, housing portions 80A and 80B were fabricated from commonly available copper tubing, sized such that the outer diameter of portion 80A fitted tightly within the inner diameter of portion 80B.
In this embodiment, magnetic unit 90 comprises a pair of disk-shaped magnets 90A and 90B, and a button-type magnet 90C. A steel or other magnet metal striking surface 70 is also provided. FIG. 3B depicts mechanism 50 in its normal configuration, e.g., not broken-apart, and also depicts the striking surface portion of a metal hammer head 20. In this embodiment magnetic surface 70 (to which the head of a metal fastener is magnetically attachable) is outer surface portion of element 110. As shown, magnets 90A and 90B fit within the cylindrical-shaped interior of element 110, and are magnetically retained therein. Element 110 with magnets 90A and 90B (or a single magnet, if desired) within is fitted within the front portion of housing portion 80A. As shown in FIGS. 3A and 3B, the front region of portion 80A is flared inward slightly to define an open circular region (thus exposing surface 70 of element 110), which flare prevents element 110 from sliding to the left (in the figures shown). Magnet 90C attaches magnetically to magnet 90B, and provides magnetic surface 100, which magnetically secures mechanism 50 to the metal striking surface 40 of the head 20 of hammer 10. Note too that there is an overlap of distance at least L between the inner rim of housing 80B and the perimeter of a portion of the hammer head.
It will be appreciated that causing hammer 10 to be magnetic requires but a few seconds for a user to slip mechanism 50 onto at least the striking surface region of the hammer head. The head of a fastener 60 is then attached, using magnetism present to surface 70, whereupon a user can swing the hammer with one hand to start and drive home the fastener. When hammer 10 is not required to be magnetic, the user simply slides mechanism 50 off of the hammer head.
An advantage of the configuration shown in FIGS. 3A and 3B is that unit 110 absorbs the physical impact of striking fasteners with the hammer head, thus sparing magnetic unit 90 from damage. But should magnet 90A eventually become damaged due to repeated impacts, or if unit 110 is omitted such that surface 70 is actually the outer surface of a magnet, it is a simple task to replace the outmost magnet, here magnet 90A. Note too that if desired, a thin wafer 120 of non-magnet material might be attached to surface 100 of magnet 90C to intentionally reduce somewhat the magnetic force retaining mechanism 50 to surface 40 of the hammer head. Alternatively, wafer 120 could be magnetic material, but with holes formed in the material to reduce the effective magnetic attraction surface area, to thus reduce the magnetic retaining force. Such reduction in magnetic force would reduce any tendency of the hammer head to accumulate residual magnetism. Naturally, the resultant magnetism would still be sufficiently strong to ensure that mechanism 50 does not fly off the hammer head in the course of use.
FIG. 3C depicts an embodiment in which magnetic unit 90 is a single magnet, and in which housing 80 is simply a cylindrical shell, preferably with a flared-in edge to help retain magnetic unit 90 in place. In this embodiment, one surface of the magnet is striking surface 70, and the other surface of the magnet is magnetic surface 100, which helps retain mechanism 50 to surface 40 of the hammer head. It is understood that a metal disk 130 could be provided within housing 80 to act as striking surface 70, and thus reducing the likelihood of damaging the adjacent surface of magnet 90. As such, material 130 is preferably durable and responsive to magnetism, e.g., a ferrous metal. Similarly, if desired, a wafer of non-magnetic material 120 could be attached to the other end of magnet 90 to intentionally reduce the magnet attraction to the hammer head.
It will be appreciated that manufacturing cost of the present invention in its various embodiments is relatively low. If the magnetic unit eventually loses magnetism or should become otherwise damaged, the magnetic unit or the damaged sub-component may be replaced, or indeed the entire mechanism may be replaced.
Modifications and variations may be made to the disclosed embodiments without departing from the subject and spirit of the invention as defined by the following claims. For example, but for considerations of mechanism stability, housing 80 could be disposed of, especially if the hammer-facing surface of the magnetic unit had a cup-like or tube-like shape to fit at least partially over the striking surface region of the hammer head.

Levy David, HUJI, Faculty of Agricultural, Food and Environmental Quality Sciences
Background
Global potato production amounts to about 19.5 million hectares (5.7 million in China as of 2017) out of which 6.3 million hectare (~33%) are grown for starch production. In 2016, Europe’s potato starch production share comprised 73.5% of global production; China took about 10.7%; North America ~ 6.9%;and Japan’s potato starch production share was 6.4%.
The high quality potato starch is essential and particularly valued in the food, paper, adhesives, building, and textile industries. This is due to potato starch’s unique texture, neutral taste and high clarity compared to other starches. In the food industry, starches are used widely for their ability to provide texture and viscosity.
Potato quality is measured by the dry matter content, i.e. the total solids minus the water content, which influences the texture, yield, fat content and is correlated with specific gravity. The higher the dry matter content, the more valuable the potatoes.
All over the world, potatoes are propagated from tubers. One hectare of potato field requires up to 2-2.5 tons propagules at a cost of USD ~760/hectare.
A number of public and private organizations have attempted to propagate potatoes from true seed for food with little success.
Our Innovation
Our researchers have developed True Potato Seeds (TPS) for the propagation of potatoes in the starch industry.
- TPS are cheaper and easier to handle than potato tubers.
- Seeds do not carry over pests and diseases from the original seed-production field to the commercial potato field, hence losses due to viral, bacterial and fungal infection are small, and use of pesticides and damage to the environment are minimal.
- Production costs are reduced from USD ~760/hecater when using actual tubers to USD ~435/hectare when using TPS (plus nursery costs which are equivalent to those in other Solanum species).
- Therefore, the replacement of the current system of planting tubers by transplanting TPS seedlings is of a significant economic consequence.
Technology
1. We managed to induce profuse flowering and produce viable seeds.
2. We selected for hi-dry matter genotypes thus producing hi-starch varieties. Lines show between 4-6% higher dry matter content
3. We have already proven that selection for dry-matter rich lines is feasible and own high dry-matter breeding lines.
Opportunity
The researcher is looking for industry partners for sponsoring continued research to achieve the following goal:
- Establish a reproducible and reliable system for mass TPS production and adopt nursery technologies (as in other Solanaceae).
- Continue the selection of superior breeding lines.
- Run small scale evaluation studies in open fields.
- Run large scale evaluation studies.
- Develop treatment and handling protocols of the TPS and seedlings in the nursery (as common in other Solanaceae). This is an exact repetition of #1
- Assess yields, dry matter and starch content under field conditions.About Iraq
Mesopotamia, the cradle of civilizations, Bet Nahrain (house of two rivers-Tigris and Euphrates) are all names that refer to Iraq. Iraq is the home of many ancient civilizations such as Summerians, Akadians, Babylonians, and Assyrians. These civilizations had profound impact on Human civilization, including the first system of state governance, the first system of language writing, the first epic in literature (the Epic of Gilgamesh), the first constitution (the code of Hamurabi), and astrology. (Ur) is the Akadian city in south of Iraq, from which Abraham the father of prophets started his journey. Baghdad was founded in the 7th century AD, and became one of the most important centers of human civilization for about 500 years.
The population of Iraq constitutes mainly of Arabs, Kurds, Turkmans, and Chaldoassyrian syriacs. Islam is the religion of the majority of people in Iraq (96%). Other religions(4%) include Christians, Sabee’s, Izidees, and Jews.International bioinformatics experts to participate in summer school for young researchers
Navarrabiomed, the joint biomedical research centre of the Government of Navarra and the Public University of Navarra, is hosting this week the STATegra Summer School on NGS and Data Integration, a course organised by Navarrabiomed’s Translational Bioinformatics Unit.
Recent progress in genomic sequencing and its numerous applications in basic and applied research produce a huge amount of data on a daily basis that are extremely useful for medical diagnosis and treatment. In this field, bioinformatics ensures the best exploitation of data processing, with full compliance of data protection regulations and bioethical standards.
In the course, young researchers will learn how to integrate different types of data generated in basic and clinical research. They will also get acquainted with biomedical data analysis tools and methods. The students’ diverse backgrounds – they come from such scientific fields as biology, biochemistry, pharmacy, informatics and mathematics – is ideal for multidisciplinary research.
Keynote speakers are Ricardo N. Ramírez of Harvard Medical School, USA; Jesper Tegnér of King Abdullah University of Science and Technology (KAUST), Saudi Arabia; Sonia Tarazona of Príncipe Felipe Research Centre, Valencia, Spain; Narsis Kiani of Karolinska Institutet, Sweden; and Vincenzo Lagani of Ilia State University, Georgia.
The coordinator of the summer school and Head of the Translational Bioinformatics Unit, David Gómez-Cabrero, stresses the relevance of the event: ‘Our intensive courses of more than twelve hours a day for a whole week, taught by internationally renowned scientists, offer the latest tools in a broad number of fields of research in a multidisciplinary environment, beyond the classroom and the lab.’
Translational Bioinformatics Unit
The Translational Bioinformatics Unit at Navarrabiomed conducts translational-oriented research projects aimed at finding solutions to major challenges in modern medicine. Worthy of mention are NAGEN 1000 (genomics) and PHARMANAGEN (pharmacogenetics), funded by the Economic Development Department at the Directorate General of Industry, Energy and Innovation of the Government of Navarra, as part of the Intelligent Specialisation Strategy S3.
The Translational Bioinformatics Unit works in collaboration with national research centres such as CNAG-CRG and Progreso y Salud Foundation, as well as with international centres like Karolinska Institutet, King’s College London and King Abdullah University of Science and Technology (KAUST).Nepal
Nepal has successfully transitioned from post-conflict status since the end of the civil war in 2006. The November 2013 elections marked an important step toward the peaceful formation of an inclusive and democratic secular state. The country’s economy has grown steadily in the past seven years, even if unreliable electricity supplies and low-quality transportation networks still constitute significant bottlenecks. In parallel with this growth, Nepal has made strong progress on many social indicators, but the rates of child and women’s malnutrition remain high. Access to health services is mostly unequal and of low quality.
Nepal is also highly vulnerable to climate change and natural disasters. Recent records show an increasing number of droughts, floods, hailstorms, landslides and crop diseases, which have a severe impact on poverty and livelihood.
The country is still recovering from the massive twin earthquakes that struck in April and May 2015, killing more than 8,800 people, injuring more than 22,000, destroying nearly 600,000 homes and leaving millions in need of food, clean water and adequate shelter. (Sources: UNICEF 2016; UNDP 2016)

Yes, we love our jobs writing about whatever topic or niche we have chosen to share so passionately with the blogosphere…Day in and day out. The work involved behind the scenes is incredible. The (occasional….or maybe more than) pressure we feel to keep our game on point is immense. Behind the scenes includes everything from forecasting posts for upcoming holidays or events to working with sponsors to editing photos to blog maintenance or replying to reader’s comments and more. Even keeping up with other bloggers! Blogging is much more than what you see when you pull up our pretty home page.
Don’t even get me started on how little money most bloggers make.
I think I can speak on behalf of most of the blogging community when I say reader comments and e-mail’s rank pretty high in the payment and moral departments. We are here to write about topics we love in order to benefit you – our readers! Therefore, anytime we hear from you or you pin our projects on Pinterest or share our blog post with your friends, it makes us feel as if those hours (and hours!) put into that one little post about organizing the pantry was totally worth it.
Sometimes, we even receive recognition from companies when they reach out with an offer to do business with us. We love that too!
But sometimes – sometimes – you’re recognized or acknowledged by someone you have admired and idolized for years. Then….well, then it is really all worth the stress, agony and love put into that one little post.
2 weeks ago i whipped my home office into shape using Martha Stewart’s home office products. Martha’s company reached out with the offer to send me a big box of her home office supply products. My contact challenged me to put the products to good use, blog about it and share great photos. After the move, one of the first spaces I needed completely set up and functioning was my home office. You can imagine, their offer arrived at the perfect time.
full disclosure: I wasn’t paid for my time to write about her pretty home office products. The payment came in the form of product for me and a giveaway for my lovely readers. I was more than happy to do anything with Martha Stewart and her company because I adore everything she does and creates. I’ve admired her for years. Really, who hasn’t!? But they did say if Martha liked my ideas/space she would do something. I didn’t know what that “something” might be, but I worked my tail off to make this home office a lovely, Martha-worthy space. Didn’t create the space just for her…I really did want a pretty, bright home office for me too. 😉
To my surprise, one day into my Martha Stewart home office week I discovered this….
ummmm, say what?!
Martha herself pinned my home office ideas onto her organization pinterest board?!
That was enough payment for a full year, as far as I’m concerned. It’s the little things for this girl. Period. and that little thing, from my life-long homemaking idol, will give me the boost of confidence and motivation needed to continue blogging for another year (or more). I’m sharing this bit of recognition to have a record of my own for the blog. It truly meant the world to me and I view this as a milestone worth noting along my small business journey. Hopefully, I’ll be working with Martha and her company for a very long time. It’s too much fun!
That little confidence boost came at the right time too. As I continue settling in at the new house and finding my way in a new area with new routines (for example, 2 schools but 3 different drop-off and pick-up schedules), I have found my available blogging time decrease a bit. But today my littlest person started pre-school….
That means 5 glorious mornings of alone time to organize, project and share with you! Thank you for hanging around as the dust settles over here. You guys are the best!
xoxo,
sam

Hi,
Just found your blog a couple weeks ago and absolutely LOVE it! I didn't know anything about Martha Stewart home office organization until your post. I immediately went out and purchased a lot of her products at Staples. I love organizing and have had the best time getting my home in order. Also, The Container Store should be contacting you too! I've spent a fortune there the last week from you mentioning it in your blog. 😉
Congrats. How exciting. I love your blog!
I absolutely love yourblog 🙂
Yay! I would be so overjoyed to be recognized by The Icon Herself! I don't have a blog, but in my heart I do, and it would be so great to have it recognized. Kudos to you from the South!
Congratulations! What a compliment! I have thoroughly enjoyed reading about your move and all of the crazy business that goes along with that. Hang in there!
Congratulations, Samantha! That is truly awesome! Martha Stewart is one heck of a great lady who I respect and admire. My son is an Executive Chef, and Martha arrived with an entourage of friends at one of the restaurants one day — totally unannounced! He just happened to be at that particular restaurant that day and personally prepared the meal for she and her friends. I've been floating on a cloud over this for quite some time! So maybe one day soon you will be asked to appear on her show and share some of your great ideas with the television world.
It's been really fun following as you get settled into your new home. I look forward to seeing more of your wonderful ideas.
Congrats! I was just thinking earlier today that I dont know ow bloggers do it…but I'm glad you do!! Your blog is such a fun, inspiring read. And love the pic of your baby. 🙂President Mugabe resigned from office on Tuesday after being at the helm for the past 37 years. Cde Mugabe resigned following a week of unrelenting pressure from the public and his own party Zanu-PF which recalled him as leader of the party and State President. There were wild celebrations throughout the country following announcement of Cde Mugabe’s resignation at the age of 93.
“As I address you, Iam aware of the whole range of concerns which have come from you all citizens of our great nation and which thus deserve our untrammelled attention” said Cde Mugabe.
The incoming leadership therefore has to hit the ground running if it is to meet the people’s expectations. We appreciate that the challenges facing the nation cannot be addressed overnight but people want to see a change of focus from leadership squabbles to bread and butter issues.
The former President acknowledged that the economy is going through a difficult patch and he blamed this on lack of unity and commonness of purpose in both the ruling party and Government. What is therefore clear going forward is that those put in leadership positions should know that it is imperative for them to have a shared vision in order to pull in one direction. The leaders should avoid what was happening in the past which saw the implementation of a number of important projects stalled.
Cde Mugabe as the captain of the ship takes the blame for most of his Government’s failures but it has to be appreciated that he was leading a team which cannot be absolved from blame. It is a fact that some of the ministers who were in the previous Government will be retained and it is our fervent hope that they learnt from the shortcomings of the previous administration. The ZDF, the citizens and the leadership of the ruling party are very clear on what needs to be done to address the many challenges facing our economy which prompted the ZDF to intervene.
Cde Emmerson Mnangagwa who has been nominated to take over from Cde Mugabe as both the leader of the party and State President, has said he is committed to lead the struggle for the revival of the country’s economy. He said his desire is to join all Zimbabweans in a new era where corruption, incompetency, dereliction of duty, laziness, social and cultural decadency is not tolerated.
The country is endowed with natural resources such as minerals, land, game and other such resources which should not be a preserve of a few. The people demonstrated during the past few days that they can be united for a common purpose and it is this unity of purpose that is required if we are to overcome the economic challenges the country is facing.
Men and women appointed to leadership positions should be individuals who are committed to improve the people’s welfare and the new dispensation should not hesitate to weed out the undesirable elements that go against the grain. The media on its part should play its watchdog role of making the leadership accountable to the people. It is our belief that the days of being in Parliament or Government to warm up chairs are over. Those that cannot deliver on their mandate should be shown the door. We want to once again remind the incoming leadership that the people have very high expectations.

General SecretaryFilling the backyard using its shaggy green leaves and conical, aromatic blooms, the butterfly bush (Buddleja davidii) is a fast growing, decorative shrub indigenous to China. The plant Boise distribute its branches 4-to 10-feet broad and can easily achieve its height of 6 to 10-feet in several years. Gardeners increase the butterfly bush because of its brilliant, nectar- blooms that attract a number of the most important pollinators of the garden San Diego: ladybugs, honey-bees and hummingbirds.The butterfly bush generally suffers few issues and tolerates a broad array of soil types and climate conditions. The direst enemies of it’s are drought and neglect, which could stress the plant and cause extra issues.
Few or No Blooms
A butterfly bush that is wholesome can create a prolific variety of colorful blooms beneath the conditions that are right. The bush wants water, especially through the beginning of its own growing period, to create flowers Long Beach. Among the causes of absence of blossoms is inadequate or incorrect pruning. Through the winter, where the climate is milder, the butterfly bush doesn’t die-back in California. Prune the canes several inches over the soil surface, following the season has finished in late summer. New shoots will develop in the roots, growing new flower development.
Wilting Leaves
The butterfly bush is struggling from lack of water in the event the leaves are brown and shriveled. Water is needed by the butterfly bush throughout dry spells through the entire season and during its development period in springtime. The shrub is affected with herbicide toxicity in the event the leaves are green and shriveled. Herbicide sprayed on a different area or a lawn (Calcium chloride snow removal Boise Lake City, UT) in the backyard can migrate to watering the lawn in San Diego or the bush from large rain. Herbicide use close to the backyard and keep the shrub well-watered throughout the development period. To prevent root-rot, don’t water throughout times of plentiful rainfall or during the winter winter months.
Excessive and Untamed Development
The butterfly bush might develop into thickets that are thick, un-attractive. Yearly pruning Boise that is tough can help manage the plant Chico. The butter Fly bush is regarded an invasive weed in Oregon and Washington, where the s Oil is abundant as well as the rainfall mo-Re abundant. Along the coastline in California, where the environment is somewhat the s Oil sandy as well as drier, the butter-Fly bush is less of an issue. It may possibly, nevertheless, group out native vegetation and type dense thickets in gardens that are specific. To get a grip on spread, eliminate every spring, tiny suckers that sprout close to the initial plant Calcium chloride snow removal New Haven Lake City. Following the time that is blooming, prune a-T least one-third of the plant Fresno down to the stems, leaving three or four inches of the stalk over the soil.
Pests or Ailments
The butter Fly bush h AS illnesses or enemies, but the shrub might be attacked if it’s suffering tension over- toxicity. Bushes may be, afflicted by microscopic parasites that reside in the s Oil, nematodes in the s Oil of the California coast. Aphids or Spider mites, generally available to the stems and undersides of leaves, suck the juices of the plant Redding. Insect infestations are associated with yellowing foliage, reddish or brown -coloured places along with a sooty mould on the leaves and stems. Typical blasts of water spray or soaps loosen the pests and discourage infestation. In places that are moist, mildew may be developed by the bush. By watering in the first morning, permitting the water to dry in the sunlight this is resolved. Chemical pesticides, as these poisonous items might damage the organic wild life including bees and hummingbirds.

Yesterday I attempted bread using Rhonda's bread making for beginners recipe . A traditional method involving kneading. I followed her recipe quite closely, wanting to give myself the best chance of success before I observed how it works and if we like at which point I can begin my personal 'tweaking' of the recipe. My only variations were that I did not use the gluten Flour and I used sesame seeds on the top only. I didn't take into account our super efficient oven when baking so I came away with a very dark upper crust and a thin line of doughiness in the loaf ... about 2mm so not enough to affect it really.
So today when I try it again I will preheat at a temp a little lower.
I used to be scared of yeast and scared of kneading, they both seemed to be so 'specialised' in my mind. I shied away from anything that involved them as 'out of my range of ability' and 'too many things can go wrong' options.
I got over my fears of these issues making 'Super Easy pizza Dough' a recipe I found on Best Recipes somehow in my mind making my own pizza was something I could do and try ... not as big a deal as bread ...
I laugh to myself about it now as they are essentially the same thing, the process for making Pizza dough is the same as the process for kneaded bread, its just the recipe that is different. As I made Rhonda's bread yesterday I considered subbing the butter for olive oil ... but I think I'll save that option for savoury bread's that I top with cheese and tomatoes ... or that I add herbs to.
We had this bread with dinner last night, still slightly warm. If you are used to artisan bread this loaf is light and soft in comparison, The crust is crisp but not chewy and thick as with the Artisan method breads. I encourage you all to give it a go. Rhonda has posted on her blog today regarding making bread and I see she has modified her base recipe a little from the one in the tutorial I linked to earlier here but I used the older recipe and it worked just fine so use which ever you are comfortable with. If you haven't made bread before I suggest you go to the tutorial, use that recipe and follow the steps.
A couple of you asked about the freshness of bread stored in a fabric bag, with non reply addresses. So my answers are here ...
At the end of last nights meal I put our half loaf into the fabric bag and left it on the bench overnight. This morning I had bread and jam for breakfast. The bread this morning was firmer and easier to cut - probably because it had completely cooled and when I last cut it it was still warm.
The cut surface of the bread was drier but still acceptable to eat with butter and jam. Not noticeable dryness.
For the girl/lady who makes all of her bread at the beginning of the week and store's it I'm not sure that fabric bags would keep bread fresh in that circumstance. Ours would not typically be in a bag for more than 24 hours so I can't give you an informed answer Sorry.
So what are you all waiting for ... step away from the computer and go make some bread ; )
Let us know on the forum or through the blog comments how you go.
Happy Wednesday.
That bread looks really yummy - light and soft. Well done Tammy. I've yet to venture past the pizza dough and I might give this recipe a go. Thanks for the link!
Let me be totally honest here - me don't like kneading - that is why I have a love relationship with my bread maker (grin).
I am so looking forward to having an oven - baking!! Looks yummy.
Looks delicious!
Gosh I haven't made any bread in ages, I will have to give it a go.
Linda
Oh yummy. I LOVE homemade bread. Especially the smell as it's baking. I just wish I could make a good loaf of homemade bread. I'm gonna have to try again someday.
Thanks so much for visiting my blog and taking the time to comment.
I hope you have a great day!! Beth. :)
Look great Tammy. I have just switched from Rhonda's tutorial to the artisan bread in 5. Haha. I love Rhonda's bread though, I just switched because i got the book for Christmas and as I have been a little strapped for time the idea of not having to knead is appealing on a regular basis. I'll still make a loaf or two of Rhonda's during the week though. Looks delicious- it's really good with pumpkin and sunflower seeds too. xo m.>> North Phoenix Hotel

The 1973 Ford Mustang was the last year for the first generation, and they didn't come any lower, wider, or longer. And so you can't beat a standout like this with an A/C interior and a 351 V8 under the hood. It's pretty hard not to love a red Mustang convertible. But more than just a great sunny-day color, this Mustang is memorable thanks to...well-creased sheetmetal, distinct urethane front bumper, and complete brightwork on everything from the well-integrated rear bumper, to the slender line on the wheel arches. It has the right sporty look, too, with the deep chin spoiler and full-length Mach 1-style hockey stick stripes. Plus, the black convertible top coordinates nicely with these dark elements. There's even a nice set of 15-inch Progressive alloys for added sporty distinction. With the touch of a button, the power convertible top goes down and this car takes on a whole new personality. The white interior looks great against the exterior red as it gives off a bit of a premium presentation. And this premium feeling continues as you explore the interior. High-back bucket seats, a center console, and wood-like trim gives this a high class feeling. Plus, this one looks like a loaded time capsule with features like the factory tach, deluxe dual-spoke steering wheel, and AM/FM radio. Best of all, the factory air conditioning is still blowing nice and cold, so you can really enjoy this droptop long into the summer season. As an H-code Mustang, this correctly has the 351 cubic-inch V8 under the hood. This is believed to be the original motor, and it's presented that way with the bold blue block and matching air topper radiating from within the engine bay.

My client had purchased one flat from one well known builder, while purchasing the flat the builder assured my client that he will give my client a balcony/terrace attached with the flat. Accordingly he registered the agreement to sale stating the area of terrace in the document. Now he is refusing to give the same, as he has already consumed the F.S.I. and further he revised the building plan and put the terrace on 4th floor. Now I want to know how to proceed against the builder. I have much less knowledge about these type of litigation. Kindly help me.Haiku 7

Ken Davidoff reports that the Mets are already discussing names for various leadership roles, including the on-field manager:
It doesn’t sound as though Bobby V. is the favorite, however. The Mets will be hesitant to pay Valentine the “star manager” money (think about $3 million annually) that he deserves, and although Valentine and the Wilpons have maintained good relations the past eight years, there might be hesitance to re-enter into a working agreement.
Nevertheless, given that public relations and ticket sales will factor heavily into this decision – there are no new star players coming through that door, so the manager will be it – we can’t discount Valentine II.
Davidoff also suggests that Omar Minaya will be replaced by another GM, but I don’t know how much a General Manager directly affects ticket sales — the average fan (i.e., those that don’t read Mets blogs every day) tends to have more of a connection to the manager in the dugout than the one in the front office.
One must wonder if the hiring of the next Mets manager will be the “big” acquisition of the offseason.
Every winter the Mets make a big splash of some sort to
improve the club generate ticket sales. For 2005 it was Pedro Martinez / Carlos Beltran; 2006 it was Carlos Delgado / Billy Wagner; 2007 was Moises Alou; 2008, Johan Santana; 2009, K-Rod / Putz; 2010, Jason Bay. Considering that the Mets are unlikely to shell out the money for a huge free-agent such as Cliff Lee, and don’t have the trading chips to acquire a similarly big name, their “big splash” could well be the naming of a new manager.
Ironically, Davidoff could be right when he states that Bobby Valentine’s salary could be too rich for the Wilpons’ taste. It’s funny that the owners wouldn’t blink at approving $36M for Oliver Perez or $25M for Luis Castillo, yet have serious reservations about spending $3M on Bobby Valentine. Makes one wonder.
But three million dollars for a manager beloved by fans is a heckuva lot less than $85-$100M+ for a 32-year-old pitcher whose presence may have less impact on putting fannies in the seats. This point is especially important when you consider that on his own, Cliff Lee is unlikely to be the “last piece” of the puzzle that sends the Mets into the postseason. The Mets have several issues to address — the health of Johan Santana and Carlos Beltran, the closer role, Jason Bay’s return to form, for example — and one big-name player can’t fix them all. However, a new manager with a track record of success in Flushing and ability to entertain the press will give the franchise a new face to look at, and promote the image of good things to come. Even if the Mets struggle through another losing record in 2011, the combination of new leadership in the dugout and home-grown youngsters on the field will be enough to sell tickets through 2012. Who knows it might even result in a playoff appearance by 2013.
From a business perspective, making a manager the “big” acquisition makes good sense — it’s a low-risk, low-cost proposition that is likely to result in positive returns. We’ll soon see if that’s the “splash” the Mets make this winter.
then Ala Harazin, Phillips, and even Omar there will be trades and FA signings……But better results?
I think Omar has done HIS job. There is a ML nucleus, a young core and a new stadium. There are TWO potential young closers, at least two young starters. AND Reyes Wright, Santana, Beltran, Pagan, Ike Davis, Bay, Pelfrey, even Krod are a decent core to a roster for a new GM or manager…….5 all-star players………better than what omar/Wille had.
BEWARE: I think DW is a prime candidate to be traded by a new GM.- Company

Why is it advantageous to mark clinically positive lymph nodes before starting neoadjuvant systemic therapy (NAST)?
Because the lymph node migrates
In case of clinical response, the previously positive node might not be detectable without a marker after NAST
For guidance of radiotherapy

Scientific background
Neoadjuvant systemic therapy (NAST) has become more popular for treating breast cancer patients. The aim is to downstage or eradicate the disease and so enable breast-conserving surgery (instead of mastectomy) or a surgical approach in the first place. In case of a clinically node-positive (cN+) diagnosis, administration of NAST targets to eradicate the disease in the lymph nodes, thereby potentially enabling omission of axillary lymph node dissection (ALND) and reducing the risk of post-surgical morbidities such as lymphœdema.. Once detected and excised, the respective lymph nodes are analysed. ALND can only be avoided if no residual cancer burden can be detected in the lymph nodes. Accurate staging requires a highly sensitive and comprehensive analysis such as is possible with OSNA (One-Step Nucleic Acid Amplification). OSNA is a molecular assay which allows rapid analysis of the entire lymph node, thereby avoiding missing even tiny metastases.
Why is it difficult to locate previously positive lymph nodes after NAST with confidence?
Through NAST, nodal shrinkage may occur and in consequence, the marker device may shift into surrounding tissue. [1]. It can be easily and accurately located using the Sentimag® magnetometer, making it a highly intuitive, wire-free and non-radioactive system that can be used by any hospital.

We got there late Friday night; Nealy had plowed a path for us to get into the cabin (there is no road, so without being plowed in, you can't get there). The cabin was f-f-f-freezing. Bleek started up the woodstove and we turned the baseboard heaters on. It warmed up pretty well.
Saturday morning we went toboganning. So fun. the hill, it a 2 minute walk from the cabin. We had brought the old school sled as well as the mini luges for the boys. The thing is because this isn't a regular toboggan hil, we had to pack down the snow ourselves. The boys didn't have trouble, because they could walk on top of the snow. Bleek and I however, sunk down with every step and the snow was over my knees!
Satruday afternoon we decided to go into town. The wind had picked up and it was snowing again. Enough the blow our plowed out path. We got stuck once, but Bleek dug us out. The tractor path is just wide enough for a truck - barely. So if you go a few inches to the left or right you get stuck. However, even with being plowed out you have to drive fairly fast to keep the momentum, otherwise you get stuck anyways. So after digging out the first time, 20 ft later we got stuck again. This time, we were really stuck, so we called Nealy with OnStar. He came and pulled us out. Such a nice guy - we invited him for dinner Saturday night. Nealy came over from Ireland about 6 years ago. He has an extremely thick accent, but after you are around him for a little while, it's easier to understand.
Sunday we decided to get up and go tracking. We saw tons of rabbit tracks, but no coyote. Which is nice for me, I don't much care for coyotes. Bleek broke the trail, and the boys and I followed him. However, going through the forest the snow was up to Bleek's knees, which meant it wasWAY to high for Logan. So I had to carry him for a little bit. He complained, but we carried on. More sledding Sunday afternoon. It's amazing, if you dress for the cold, you don't even notice it!! Although, getting all those layers and things on is a royal PITA, as is removing them, but whatever, all in the name of Winter fun I suppose.
Monday the drive back was uneventful. Roads were nice and dry, no blowing snow or anything. Perfect. We got back in time so that I could make a drive over to GG's to see how she was getting on and if she needed anything. Jackie had visited her Saturday and Angie visited her after I did on Monday, so I think she's got everything she needs for the next few days.
Bleek is going to go back out to the cabin this weekend to get some work done. We want to insullate the windows and maybe put up some tile behind the woodstove. But that job is easier done when the kids aren't there. So I'll stay home this time.
All in all, very nice long weekend!exploring our creative evolution
August 6, 1991
It started in the Swiss Alps. The year was 1980. Tim Berners-Lee, a British software engineer working temporarily at CERN, the European Laboratory for Particle Physics in Geneva, was fooling with a way to organize his far-flung notes. Building on ideas then current in software design, he fashioned a kind of “hypertext” notebook. Words in a document could be linked to other files on Berner-Lee’s computer. But why not he wondered, open up his document – and his computer – to everyone and allow them to link their stuff to his. So he cobbled together a coding system – HTML (HyperText Markup Language) – and designed an addressing scheme that gave each web page a unique location, or URL (Universal Resource Locator). And he hacked a set of rules that permitted these documents to be linked together on computers across the Internet.
And on the seventh day, Berners-Lee assembled the World Wide Web’s first browser, which allowed users anywhere to view his creation on their computer screen. He alerted the world by way of a message to a newsgroup and the world came. On August 6, 1991, the web made its debut, instantly bringing order to the chaos that was cyberspace. From that moment on, the web and the internet grew as one, often at exponential rates. Within five years, the number of internet users jumped from 600,000 to 40 million. Until then, we hadn’t really known what a powerful new tool the computer could be for everyone. Now we do.

PHILADELPHIA (CBS) — Pennsylvania Gov. Tom Wolf introduced his administration has filed a lawsuit against IBM for their “fraud and failures” related to the Unemployment Compensation Modernization paraphernalia undertaking.
according to the governor, the task become awarded to IBM in a set-rate constrict for $109.9 million with a completion date of February 2010.
“All advised, Pennsylvania taxpayers paid IBM nearly $one hundred seventy million for what became speculated to exist a complete, built-in, and up to date paraphernalia that it under no circumstances acquired,” Wolf pointed out.
“instead, the department of Labor and industry has been forced to proceed to aid lots of its UC software actions via a set of growing old, expensive legacy programs, incurring tens of millions of bucks in server, assist and upkeep charges.”
The governor’s workplace says an unbiased assessment of the IBM task suggested that DLI no longer continue with the assignment because of the excessive possibility of failure.
as a result of IBM’s benefits gadget presented “unacceptable hazards and would exist unreliable,” according to the governor’s office, DLI allowed the UCMS constrict to lapse on its September 28, 2013 expiration date.
At that factor, the UCMS task turned into 45 months at the back of agenda and $60 million over budget.
The administration lawsuit, which changed into filed on behalf of the department of Labor and trade, assert claims for breach of contract, fraudulent misrepresentation, derelict misrepresentation, advantageous fraud, and fraudulent concealment.

AI and laptop getting to know took middle stage at IBM feel this yr, as the display’s main AI bulletins served as a reminder that the company has one of the most most differentiated and aggressive functions for enforcing AI in commerce operational processes in the market. but when massive Blue is to win the AI race against AWS, Microsoft and Google Cloud in 2019 and beyond, it acquire to ameliorate its developer fashion and toughen its communications, above flawless in areas it leads the market, akin to in trusted AI and governance.
Let's dig a miniature deeper into IBM’s AI method, the leading believe announcements and what they suggest for the market.Welcome to Chapter 2 of Digital Transformation
IBM CEO Ginni Rometty kicked off the feel event with an stress on how groups are coming into "chapter two" of cloud adoption and digital transformation. This subsequent section is defined by corporations scaling up their digital initiatives, employing data on a compund of usual IT techniques and public and private clouds, and inserting AI on the middle of their company techniques.
Rometty took the possibility to shed some mild on IBM's subsequent chapter as neatly, following its $34 billion acquisition of crimson Hat in 2018. red Hat has breathed modern life into IBM and its approach, which is now focussed on hybrid, multicloud features. IBM claimed that ninety four % of corporations are using a compund of public and private cloud environments today, and two-thirds are the usage of more than one public cloud company. Many tremendous establishments continue to exist panicked of lock-in with the aid of the hyperscale cloud providers and are rightly concerned about their potential to stream records between clouds, and about making spend of connectivity, management and security amongst them constantly.
IBM's method, which was evident flawless through Rometty's keynote, is to tackle these considerations by means of providing a opt for-and-combine set of services fashioned from its middleware heritage that assist purchasers maneuver workloads spanning these environments. here is based on open-supply technologies comparable to Kubernetes containers and OpenShift, purple Hat’s container application platform.
linked Article: How Will the $34B IBM Acquisition acquire an consequence on crimson Hat clients?IBM’s AI approach: moving organizations beyond Experimentation
This set the stage for an immense boost to IBM’s AI approach. Rometty brought up that Watson engagements now complete 20,000 — a 25 p.c boost from 16,000 in 2018, spanning 20 industries and 80 countries. despite the fact, despite this adoption, the market remains incredibly experimental, with many valued clientele nevertheless engaging in proofs of thought or implementing slim element options and preferring to birth small. youngsters they foretell that through the conclusion of 2020, ninety % of massive corporations might exist running pilot or production-level desktop discovering applications, only a few will acquire entirely implemented the know-how inside company techniques or acquire a finished AI approach. this is as a result of terrible satisfactory of statistics, a exigency of talents, and concerns about trust in the expertise.
IBM’s strategy and portfolio makes a speciality of these core challenges and comprises a prioritization of its scope of huge records and analytical tools, and the plumbing of AI, reflected in Rometty’s keynote slogan "there is no AI without IA" (assistance structure). A key product is IBM Cloud deepest for information, its oddly named platform for managing and governing desktop studying statistics that integrates data science, information engineering and software edifice processes birthright into a single console and administration atmosphere.
integrated with IBM Cloud inner most for data are a brace of key Watson solutions:
believe’s greatest announcement was IBM Watson any place, which adds yet another key dimension to this portfolio. in step with its corporate strategy, IBM pointed out that it might accomplish Watson transportable throughout several public clouds, giving businesses a constant approach to construct, set up and race AI fashions and functions in on-premises and public cloud environments similar to AWS, Alibaba, Google Cloud or Azure.
IBM has developed modern Watson microservices in Kubernetes containers using OpenShift, which abstracts Watson from its ragged dependency on the underlying IBM cloud infrastructure. It hopes the pliability of Watson anywhere, in line with open-source, will motivate more corporations to circulation beyond experimenting with AI by using giving them extra options to race AI anyplace data resides and thereby reducing the dread of lock-in.
IBM has staked out an immense pretense in the AI market with the circulation. In Rometty's words, Watson is now "the most open and scalable AI platform for agencies on the earth" which is poles apart from 18 months in the past, when Watson was plagued by PR problems and a attractiveness for being costly, rigid and a black-container device. although IBM will must consequence money into integrating, configuring and optimizing Watson to work always with the entire essential public clouds, the movement reinvigorates its strategy after a tough few years.
related Article: Is the IBM Watson company Unassailable?leading in the Governance of synthetic Intelligence
a different basic share of IBM's approach that got here alive at feel turned into Watson OpenScale, its AI administration and governance platform that includes the acquire confidence, monitoring, explanation and transparency paraphernalia launched in 2018 (see Trusting Watson). Born out of its analysis arm, the platform aims to ply concerns about "black field" AI by using giving shoppers the way to enhance the visibility and manage of AI systems as well as clarify consequences. It does this with the aid of monitoring the efficiency, fitness and conduct of machine studying models at runtime.
CCS perception has lengthy argued that agencies exigency extra instruments to aid them construct guardrails round AI and X-ray visibility into working methods. believe in AI — or a scarcity of it — is rising as the largest barrier to machine learning adoption in firms. for example, in CCS insight's 2018 survey of IT choice-makers within the US and Europe, 43 % of respondents mentioned believe as a hurdle to adoption in their company. here's why IT determination makers positioned the potential to accomplish sure facts safety, compliance and the transparency of how methods work among the excellent three necessities for his or her computer learning investments in 2019, based on the survey.
The rectify governance of AI will turn into essential in setting up trust in the technology, specifically as organizations consequence in obligate AI of their operations over the subsequent 12-18 months. Governance spans 4 censorious domains: moral design and bias; transparency and explainability; privacy; and protection, management and compliance. Watson OpenScale carries one of the most first devices out there and is as a minimum one year forward of the competitors during this well-known box.venture Debater ancient event
IBM made a number of other key strikes value noting. It introduced a brand modern product for commerce technique automation, known as fashion Automation Intelligence with Watson. It likewise opened feel with a historical taste which featured the first ever reside and public debate between IBM’s task Debater and human debate champion, Harish Natarajan. in response to its AI analysis in Tel Aviv, mission Debater is the primary AI device within the fields of herbal language processing, computational argumentation and reasoning, computer listening comprehension and deep gaining knowledge of, designed to debate people on advanced issues.
Natarajan received the talk in keeping with the audience vote, but 60 % felt IBM’s platform better enriched their advantage of the zone as assignment Debater turned into in a position to exist mindful topics precisely, contextualize competencies and consequence collectively a significant narrative flawless over the controversy. The taste illustrated how speedy AI is progressing and became yet another reflection of how effective IBM’s analysis arm is to its commerce as few firms are transitioning AI research into items quicker than IBM in 2019.
linked Article: The subsequent Frontier for IT: AI EthicsIBM in 2019 and past
consider confirmed us that IBM has one of the most most differentiated and competitive enterprise capabilities for imposing AI in enterprise operational approaches in the market. In improving the readability of its company message, IBM has additionally delivered some much essential simplification to the positioning of its scope of AI items over the past one year, which can exist choicest seen through the image I took at the event under.
a much bawl from 18 months ago, IBM can now point to effective differentiators in featuring open, hybrid and multicloud features, governance and utilized AI for industries, in addition to having a extensive portfolio operating from systems to functions which is supported with the aid of a formidable analysis arm and Massachusetts Institute of technology partnership that are feeding its factory of latest AI items at an expanding fee.
youngsters, IBM's fashion is never best and it still has work to attain in enhancing its advertising and marketing and messaging, exceptionally in the areas it leads, corresponding to depended on AI and governance. Key product names are likely to discombobulate and don’t accentuate the cost proposition sufficient. And regardless of improvements in how Watson is marketed, it continues to exist an discrepant manufacturer used greatly across the business.
chiefly, IBM will additionally deserve to ameliorate its fashion for builders. This zone received miniature attention at suppose 2019. crimson Hat's eight million open-supply builders should still exist a major expand to its Apple partnership, as will the flexibility in its approach with Watson anyplace, however IBM will deserve to galvanize upon the developer neighborhood about why its AI paraphernalia are the most efficient.
normal, contemplate published some fine steps ahead in IBM’s AI strategy. however these advancements could exist censorious if IBM is to win the AI wars and enterprise AI market in 2019 and past.

CAMBRIDGE, Mass., Feb. 26, 2019 /PRNewswire/ -- IBM (NYSE: IBM) protection nowadays announced results from the annual 2019 IBM X-force threat Intelligence Index, which found that accelerated protection measures and cognizance are driving cybercriminals to alter their strategies in quest of a much better recur on investment (ROI). consequently, the document details two major shifts, including reduced reliance on malware and a decline in ransomware, as criminals elevated their spend of alternative cybercrime options with the knowledge for improved ROI.
IBM X-force likewise observed that the number of cryptojacking assaults – the unlawful spend of a company's or individual's computing energy without their potential to mine cryptocurrencies – were basically double these of ransomware attacks in 2018. With the cost of cryptocurrencies dote Bitcoin hitting a excessive of almost $20,000 going into 2018, lessen-risk/reduce-effort assaults secretly the spend of a sufferer's computing vigour acquire been on the upward thrust. really, IBM junk mail researchers only tracked one ransomware push in 2018 from probably the most world's largest malware junk mail distribution botnet, Necurs.
The IBM X-force probability Intelligence Index likewise discovered that cybercriminals were changing their stealth recommendations to capitalize illegal gains. IBM X-drive saw an expand within the maltreat of administrative tools, in its Place of using malware. more than half of cyberattacks (fifty seven p.c) leveraged ordinary administration purposes dote PowerShell and PsExec to steer transparent of detection, whereas targeted phishing assaults accounted for well-nigh one third (29 percent) of assaults.
"If they emerge on the drop within the spend of malware, the shift away from ransomware, and the upward push of focused campaigns, flawless these developments reveal us that return-on-investment is a apt motivating component for cybercriminals. They espy that efforts to disrupt adversaries and accomplish methods more durable to infiltrate are working. whereas eleven.7 billion information were leaked or stolen over the final three years, leveraging stolen individually Identifiable guidance (PII) for income requires greater potential and materials, motivating attackers to discover modern illicit income models to boost their recur on funding," pointed out Wendi Whitmore, international Lead, IBM X-force Incident Response and Intelligence services (IRIS). "one of the crucial most well-liked commodities is computing power tied to the emergence of cryptocurrencies. This has ended in company networks and consumer contraptions being secretly highjacked to mine for these digital currencies."
IBM X-drive probability Intelligence Index includes insights and observations from monitoring 70 billion safety movements per day in more than 130 nations. in addition, records is gathered and analyzed from varied sources including X-force IRIS, X-force red, IBM Managed security functions, and publicly disclosed records breach assistance. IBM X-force likewise runs lots of unsolicited mail traps flawless over and displays tens of millions of unsolicited mail and phishing assaults every day whereas analyzing billions of internet pages and pictures to notice fraudulent endeavor and manufacturer abuse.
extra findings encompass:
Cybercriminals Hack programs to accomplish cash on company' DimeCybercriminals acquire developed paraphernalia and strategies to infect each corporate servers and individual users with coin-mining malware to mine cryptocurrencies. In flip, these infections hijack computing vigour, leading to improved CPU utilization and slowed devices. This cryptojacking style is very nearly exploding, and cybercriminals acquire the talents as the two of the most commonplace infection vectors are phishing and injecting code into sites with susceptible security controls.
IBM X-force has found that illicit cryptojacking assaults are on the surge while ransomware appears to exist on the decline. Over the path of 2018, attempts to installation ransomware on X-force monitored gadgets in q4 (Oct.- Dec.) declined to less than half (forty five percent) of the attempts in Q1. in its place, cryptojacking assaults greater than quadrupled in the equal timeframe with the aid of 450 percent.
the upward push of criminal PowerShell vigour clients increasing focus of cybersecurity concerns and stricter security controls are making it more durable for cybercriminals to establish footholds on track systems. in consequence, the spend of malicious software in assaults appears to exist on the decline. more than half (57 %) of attacks analyzed by X-force in 2018, didn't leverage malware and a lot of concerned the spend of non-malicious paraphernalia including PowerShell and PsExec to steer transparent of detection. those who made the most generic spend of malware had been most well-known cybercriminal gangs and advanced persistent hazard (APT) organizations.
In circumstances the Place networks had been compromised by attackers, IBM X-drive noticed a shift to cybercriminals abusing administrative tools, as a substitute of malware, to obtain their desires. Core to these ideas is the advanced spend of PowerShell, a tool in a position to executing code from reminiscence and proposing administrative entry at once to a device's core. IBM X-drive IRIS has additionally followed attackers operating windows administration Interface Command (WMIC) queries, which can exist then used to automate the faraway execution of PowerShell commands and scripts, among different features designed to race queries, search databases, entry person directories, and attach to methods of hobby.
Transportation commerce an increasing Cybercrime target Cybercriminals aren't just altering how they hack, but likewise who they target. The fiscal functions trade remained essentially the most attacked sector of 2018 accounting for 19 % of flawless attacks followed by using IBM X-drive IRIS. however, the Transportation business—which didn't even accomplish the birthright 5 listing ultimate year—moved to the second most attacked sector in 2018, with tried attacks increasing three-fold considering the 12 months prior.
It isn't just a rely of the sheer volume of assaults, but additionally in the caliber of victims. X-force saw more public disclosures in 2018 than in previous years in the transportation business. These disclosures seemingly encouraged hackers as they may additionally display that these groups are at risk of cyberattacks and that they hang positive records akin to consumer information, fee card information, PII, and loyalty reward money owed.
techniques and Remediations The X-drive probability Intelligence Index report presents techniques for businesses to raise preparedness through preventive measures such as threat looking — proactively shopping networks and endpoints for superior threats that avert prevention and detection equipment. moreover, possibility administration fashions deserve to harmonize with seemingly danger actors, an infection strategies and skills influence to well-known company methods. groups additionally should exist aware of hazards arising from third events, comparable to cloud features, suppliers and acquisitions.
The record likewise emphasizes remediation and incident response. Even agencies with a develope safety attitude may no longer recognize a way to respond to a security incident. advantageous incident response isn't best a technical matter; leadership and cataclysm communications are key to speedy response and birthright away resuming commerce operations.

IDS 11.5 - the newest version of Informix Dynamic Server - was officially announced by IBM at the International Informix User Conference in Kansas City in April 2008. The announcement created a tremendous interest from customers, analysts and the press.
IDS 11.5 - code-named "Cheetah 2" - is the successor of version 11.1 - code-named "Cheetah" - which had been released in June 2007. IDS 11.1 provided a whole bunch of modern functionality. Based on this foundation, IBM offers with IDS 11.5 a data server, that delivers mainframe availability capabilities on the distributed platform. The term "distributed" needs a miniature more explanation in this context. It doesn't only matter LUW (Linux, Unix, Windows). IDS 11.5 has been ported to a platform that gains more and more popularity: MAC OS X 10.5, a.k.a., "Leopard." A professional data server available for a dote a glimmer growing platform that is surrounded by innovative developers - a probably powerful combination.
MACH - The Foundation of IDS 11.5
The predessor IDS 11.1 delivered a elevated availability and scalability technology called MACH (Multi-Node lively Cluster for elevated Availability). MACH allows the creation of a database cluster based on IDS. The cluster consists of several IDS instances (nodes), that are capable of accessing the identical data concurrently through a shared disk array or maintain a separate, synchronized copy of the data on dedicated disks. Data could exist license to select the approach that fits your needs best. Even a combination of shared disk access and additional synchronized, local copies of the data is supported. Multiple geographically dispersed MACH clusters can even work together andsynchronize data thru ER (enterprise replication).
Write Access on Every Cluster Node
IDS 11.5 provides the next step in MACH technology and supports write access on every node in the cluster. It doesn't matter if the client is connected to the primary or any secondary node type (SDS, HDR or RSS). flawless nodes can exist configured for read and write access and fully utilized by the application. MACH clusters don't require any special type of hardware dote like a glimmer interconnects. They can exist build upon standard hardware components dote cost efficient blade servers powered by Linux. This makes IDS 11.5 attractive even for smaller businesses and installations that require elevated availability and dynamic scalability as well.
In order to enable write access on a secondary cluster node (SDS, HDR or RSS), the onconfig parameter REDIRECTED_WRITES must exist enabled by setting it to a value other than zero. This value likewise specifies the number of network connections (SMX pipes) that will exist established by IDS between this secondary and the primary cluster node.
Connecting to a Service
Applications can directly connect to a dedicated cluster node or capitalize from the brand modern device 1).
fig1
Figure 1: IDS 11.5 - Database Cluster Architecture
Dynamic Re-Routing Through Connection Manager
The dynamic routing can exist further customized by defining service flat agreements in the connection manager configuration file. Different types of cluster nodes - Primary, SDS, HDR, RSS - can exist combined in any order to build analytic connection groups. Depending on the type of workload that an application primarily generates, it can exist connected to a analytic group thatoptimally serves those requirements. For example a write-intensive application might connect to a analytic group consisting of the Primary and several SDS nodes. In contrast a reporting application might favor a group with HDR and RSS nodes. The HDR and RSS node types currently support only the "dirty read" isolation flat while accessing data. The SDS nodes support, analog to the Primary, "committed read" as well as "committed read final committed." "Cursor Stability" and "Repeatable Read" as well as flawless kinds of DDL statements are exclusively available on the Primary only.
fig2
Figure 2: OAT - Dynamically adding a modern SDS node to the cluster
Automatic Failover Through Connection Manager
The connection manager likewise acts as an arbitrator accountable for automatic failover. If a node fails, the connection manager will exist aware of the failure. It automatically routes incoming client connections to the surviving nodes based on the defined service flat agreements. If the Primary fails, the connection manager informs another node to takeover the role. Which secondary node becomes the modern Primary can exist defined thru a FOC (fail-over configuration) policy. flawless remaining secondary node types inside the cluster - SDS, HDR and RSS - will automatically reconnect to the modern primary node. ER nodes replicating data to the cluster will exist reconnected as well.
Multiple connection managers can exist configured and started on separate machines which further raises the flat of elevated availability. Those separate connection managers can exist combined to a single group in the "sqlhosts" communication configuration file. Applications connecting to this group entry will exist routed to the available connection managers in round-robin mode, leaving out failed connection managers. It it well-known to notice that the connectionmanager only reroutes an application to the most appropriate node. After this has been done the application talks directly to that specific node, i.e., IDS instance not relying upon the connection manager anymore.
The connection manager is share of the Informix Client SDK and can exist downloaded for free from the IBM Web site. There will exist no license cost, regardless of how many instances of the connection manager you are planning to deploy. flawless connections between clients, the connection manager and the cluster nodes as well as the communication inside the cluster between the nodes can exist fully encrypted via SSL.
Version Columns
Additionally, IDS 11.5 contains another consuming feature called "version columns." Version columns can exist added to existing tables using the 'alter table <tabname> add vercols' SQL statement. They are "invisible" because they will not exist delivered to the application when performing a bona fide 'select *' SQL query. The application needs to explicitly search information from exist assigned by IDS. IDS increases the value in column 'ifx_row_version' as soon as a row is updated. Applications - especially in a Web-based environment - can capitalize from this modern functionality. The version columns enable an efficient way for an application to check if a previous selected row is still valid or has changed in the meantime.
Administration via Browser
OAT - Open Admin Tool - is a Web interface written in PHP and was first released with IDS 11.1. It can exist download at no cost. IBM continuously enhances OAT, adding modern functionality to accomplish the administration of IDS even smoother. In IDS 11.5, OAT has a modern peruse and feel, menus are restructured and contextual support topics acquire been added. The configuration, administration and monitoring of a MACH cluster thru OAT has been enhanced. Nodes can exist started and stopped, modern SDS nodes can exist dynamically added to the cluster (see device 2). OAT allows the definition of service flat agreements as well as failover configurations for the connection manager.
fig3
Figure 3: OAT - Automatic Update Statistics Configuration
In addition to the enhanced administration of MACH clusters, the updated OAT includes:
* Readonly Group Support Instances can exist combined in a 'readonly' connection group. Users connecting thru OAT to this group will exist able to monitor the members of the group but will not exist allowed to effect any administrative tasks. * Managing User Privileges Database- and table-privileges as well as roles can now exist viewed in a clearly arranged form. OAT supports granting and revoking privileges as well. * Automated Update Statistics (AUS) An automated update statistics task can exist setup. The predefined AUS task includes some nice smarts and can exist further customized thru OAT. It will exist executed on a regular basis by the IDS database scheduler (see device 3). * Dynamic Update of Configuration Parameters certain IDS configuration parameters can exist dynamically updated thru OAT without the exigency to restart the data server. * System Validation The integrity of data and extents could exist checked. * Creating modern Tasks OAT allows the setup of modern tasks that will exist executed by the database scheduler. * modern System Reports modern predefined system reports acquire been added to OAT as well as the improved tracking of historical performance data.
Command Line and SQL Admin API
Software vendors, that embed IDS as share of their integrated solution, can utilize the SQL Administration API. It allows the administration of a MACH cluster via a set of SQL API calls that can exist easily embedded in the application. (Unix) administrators, that prefer the administration via 'onmode' directly from the command line, can continue to attain duty sysadmin:task("ha rss delete", "gepard_rss1");
fig4
Figure 4: Installation Wizard - Sample Instance Configuration
What else is modern in IDS 11.5 ?
Beyond the aptitude to write data at every node in a MACH cluster and the modern connection manager, IBM introduced other modern functionality in IDS 11.5. Below you will find a summary of the most notable features:
* Instance Configuration Wizard A modern instance configuration wizard allows the setup of a fully functional IDS instance at installation time. The configuration wizard automatically adjusts key server parameters based on user input and creates an optimally tuned configuration for the specific type of workload expected (see device 4). * Dynamic SQL in Stored Procedures The Informix Stored Procedure Language now supports the execution of dynamic SQL. SQL statements can exist dynamically constructed during runtime, strengthen the power of stored procedures by giving application developers greater flexibility. * Improved Standard Configuration File The standard configuration file 'onconfig.std' has been completely restructured. For each parameter there is a description included in a remark section above the parameter. Parameters are grouped together in functional areas and acquire improved default values. The support of the environment variable $INFORMIXDIR in pathname parameters offers more flexibility. * Encryption via SSL In addition to the traditional Informix network encryption methods, IDS 11.5 supports encryption via SSL. The SSL fashion is mandatory if encryption between a DRDA client and IDS is needed. Traditional clients can spend either SSL or autochthonous Informix network encryption. Connections between servers - for example in a MACH cluster - can likewise exist enrypted via SSL. * SSO Support Single sign-on support in conjunction with Kerberos authentication is modern in IDS 11.5. * XML Enhancements XML documents can exist indexed thru BTS (Basic Textsearch Datablade - included in IDS 11.5). In contrast to IDS 11.1, this must not exist a replete text index, instead XML tag values can exist indexed in separate fields either by tag title or by path. This allows for more elastic query options for example thru XPATH expressions. The transformation of XML documents thru XSLT is feasible by utilizing the modern xsltransform() UDR.
Conclusion
IDS 11.5 is a huge step forward for IBM's distributed database business. It allows the creation of elevated availability database clusters on cost-efficient hardware. Clusters that present efficient workload balancing across flawless nodes and the aptitude censorious OLTP workloads as well as preferred data server for integrated solutions.

Several people do exercise, but only a few achieve a really impressive result. These days, all people are conscious about their fitness and ready to do every possible thing to get the desired body and shape. Are you also among them? Want to have a perfect body within a few days? If yes, then follow the below mentioned tips. Here we have mentioned some effective full-body workouts that will help you get a perfect body comfortably.
- Go for Sports in the Morning
A good number of fitness trainers recommend people regularly going for sports in the morning for at least one hour with the empty stomach. Take exercise in this period. You can get an “ideal body” with a regular morning walk, run, playing outdoor games, etc. After several months of regular exercise in the morning, your shoulders will become more elegant, the waist and hip flexe more smoothly and your gait becomes fast and confident.
- Exercise For Neck
The rapidly fading skin of your neck and the gradual appearance of the second chin externally add more than five years to the age of a woman, which is clearly reflected by the closed neck zone. To get rid of it, while pressing your fingers on your shoulders, straighten the chest, place your hands on your shoulders and try to pull your neck up as much as possible. Keep your shoulders at rest and take long breath 10 times. Repeat this exercise 15 times and relax your body after this exercise. Repeat the exercise in the opposite direction too. Take this exercise regularly to get rid of the second chin within a few days.
- Exercise For Beautiful Hands
Pump up the muscles of the hands, exercises on the biceps (front muscles) and triceps (back muscles) on a regular basis. You will need dumbbells weighing 1-2 kg to do this exercise. Take a dumbbell in each hand and spread your legs to the width of your shoulders. If you are not comfortable with it, end your arms to yourself and unbend and do three sets of exercise 20 times for each hand.
Sit on a chair, take a dumbbell in one hand and start slowly bending and unbending it until you feel tired. Using one hand, lean against the bench so that the body is parallel to the floor, take a dumbbell, and bend and unbend the arm with a dumbbell. Just keep the upper part of the working arm from tearing away from the trunk. Soon, you will have good-looking hands.
- Exercise for Making Pectoral Muscles Strong
Always keep in mind that female breast consists mainly of fatty tissues. So, every kilogram in plus or minus affects its shape and elasticity up to a great extent. It is impossible to make the breast more elastic and change its shape with exercise. But regular exercises will help to strengthen the pectoral muscles, enabling them to raise the chest sharply.
You will need a chair or football to do this exercise. The upper part of the back lie on the surface and holds the trunk on the half-bent legs. Take in each hand on the dumbbell, straighten them, slowly start lowering your hands behind your head, maximally down. After taking a deep breath, draw in the stomach while lowering your hands. Repeat this exercise to make pectoral muscles strong.
- Exercise for Perfect Belly
To achieve a perfectly shaped belly, it is important to reduce the deposits on the abdomen and caloric intake. Drink more water, give up harmful dietary habits – fast food, sweets, flour products, and take exercise daily. Just lay down on your back and bend your knees, put your feet together, fasten your hands in the lock at the back of your head. Raise the body to the knees, slightly lifting the shoulder blades above the floor. The waist should remain in place. Repeat the exercise 30 times in 3 steps. Lying on your back, bend your knees and raise your hips so that they become perpendicular to the floor, hands should be stretched along the trunk.
- Exercise for a beautiful waist
Always keep in mind that correctly executed slopes effectively help to get rid of extra centimeters in the waist area. To achieve this, combine hands in the palms and slowly make the slopes in different directions. Watch your back and do slopes strictly along the lateral line of the legs. Make two sets of 15 exercises daily to get the desired results.
- Exercise For Beautiful Buttocks And Thighs
To have beautiful buttocks, hips, and lower back, Sit on the floor and hold the casing perpendicular to the floor. With the effort of the buttocks and thighs, climb up into the pose on the table, keeping weight on your hands. During the exercise, draw in the belly. Fix the table position for 30 seconds, then return to the starting position. Repeat the exercise 30 times on at least 2 times in a week to get the desired results.
- Exercise for feet
Lie on your back, bend your knees, place your arms along the body. Begin lifting your torso until you touch the floor with only your head, shoulders, elbows and feet.

Introduction
If you’ve been on the internet at all in the last week, especially in the creative circles, then you’ve most likely heard mention of the article “Who is the Bad Art Friend?” If not, then it may be something to look into. The article, which I will get into in a moment, brings to light a lot of the “behind the scenes” things in the art world that everyday people may not consider. After all, many people know what a “bad friend” is, but what about a “bad art friend”?
Who Is the Bad Art Friend?
The article “Who Is the Bad Art Friend” was written by Robert Kolker published by The New York Times on October 5, 2021. On the surface, the article is an account of the events that led to Sonya Larson suing Dawn Dorland for defamation, Dorland counter-suing for copyright infringement, and the current court case that followed. However, as the title suggests, it delves more into a “who is in the wrong” case between the two women and the fine line artists walk between reality and fiction. I will summarize the article as best I can for those of you who haven’t read it yet—though you really should, it’s right here. If you have read it, feel free to skip ahead.
Here are the basics of what you need to know about the article.
The article starts from Dorland’s point of view in 2015 when she donated a kidney to a stranger. She didn’t do so for any reason other than to help someone in need. She started a private Facebook group of a lot of friends and family to document her journey. One of the people she invited was Larson. When Dorland realized Larson wasn’t reacting to any of the posts in the Facebook group, Dorland sent Larson a friendly email after her surgery.
About a year later, in 2016, a mutual friend informed Dorland of a short story titled “The Kindest” that Larson wrote—you can purchase the anthology to read it if you want, it’s in here—about a woman who received a kidney from a living donor. Dorland, naturally, wondered if her selfless gift inspired the story and once again reached out to Larson. Larson said she was “partially inspired” after hearing about Dorland’s “tremendous donation” and hoped that having her life inspire art didn’t make Dorland “feel too weird.” Dorland admitted she was “a little surprised” by the whole thing since Larson never really brought up Dorland’s surgery.
Dorland let it go for a while after the two “forged a fragile truce.” That is until “The Kindest” started showing up in places like Audible and the magazine American Short Fiction in 2017. It wasn’t until the latter dropped the paywall on the short story that Dorland read the story and happened upon the letter the fictional kidney donor writes to the recipient. Dorland confronts Larson about it and, when Larson denies it was Dorland’s same letter, Dorland writes many places to get the story unpublished. One of those places included the Boston Book Festival, where “The Kindest” was a part of One City One Story 2018. Ultimately, they canceled the event and the Boston Book Festival threatened to sue Larson for trying to pass off plagiarism as her work.
At the beginning of 2019, Larson sued Dorland for defamation. Dorland, not wanting to stand down and having been in contact with a lawyer for some time, counterclaimed copyright infringement and emotional distress—the judge throwing out the latter claim in 2021. As part of the court case—those faint of heart or wanting to read the article first should look away— the group chat and texts of Larson’s writing group were subpoenaed…
Lots of dirt and skeletons were discovered in those messages. However, the big question remains. Who is the bad art friend?
Who do I think the bad art friend is?
Honestly, it took me a while to come up with a conclusion myself, and even still I’m not a hundred percent sure on where I stand. One of the big things about the article is that Dorland is the one who approached The New York Times about writing it in the first place, with many saying Dorland foresaw the article going in a completely different direction. That, coupled with the many other quotes sprinkled within the article, definitely paints Dorland in a negative light. On the other hand, once I read the group chat messages—which, in my opinion, should be sacred—Larson was no longer the innocent victim either. So who do I pin as the bad art friend? Unfortunately, that’s not something I feel comfortable publicly taking a side on. I will say this, however. Being willing to right your wrongs goes a long way in my book.
How the bad art friend could’ve been avoided
Now, this next section is coming from a position of hindsight, but I do feel it’s important that we look at the actions that led up to this lawsuit. After all, while I doubt any of us will find ourselves in a position such as the Larson vs. Dorland case, it’s better to be safe than sorry. Here are the four things that I feel impacted the case the most and all artists should keep in mind in their daily lives.Here are the four things that I feel impacted the case the most and all artists should keep in mind in their daily lives. Click To Tweet
Plagiarism
The most obvious thing in the bad art friend article is the flagrant plagiarism on Larson’s side. In the group messages—which I will get to in a bit—she even says “that [Dorland’s] letter was too damn good” to not use verbatim. Writing 101 drills the importance of not plagiarizing work into any writer’s head. If plagiarism is grounds for dismissal from a university, then why would it be perceived to be okay in a professional setting? In my opinion, any writer who knowingly plagiarizes another writer’s work forgoes the right to fight a copyright infringement lawsuit filed against them. However, if the writer changes the plagiarized part of their piece—or unpublishes the entire thing—when asked, the writer can then sue for harassment or defamation if the original author doesn’t drop the case. That’s what Larson did in this instance when Dorland continued to message people Larson worked with. If the writer can prove they unknowingly plagiarized a piece, then that’s a whole different debacle. Once again, I want to remind you that this is all my opinion. I am not a lawyer or providing any sort of legal advice.
Blind Privilege
The second thing that struck me about the bad art friend article, was the privilege held by Dorland and the lack of acknowledging it. I am a white female and I am aware of the privilege I have. While I understand Dorland’s excitement around the gift of donating her kidney to a stranger, who wouldn’t feel empowered by such a selfless act, the way she approached sharing her journey and eagerness to encourage others came across as conceited. For one, who keeps track of who interacts with your posts? Why is it so important that you feel the need to email someone asking why they haven’t been reacting to your posts after your surgery? Also, while I understand wanting to invite close friends and colleagues to a group documenting a journey such as this, why would Dorland think that writers would care about her donating a kidney? Especially at a conference that happened almost a year later? None of that makes sense to me. And, the biggest thing I believe Dorland forgets about her donation is that the average person couldn’t financially do such a generous thing. While, yes, the recipient’s insurance pays for all medical services related to the organ donation, that’s only the medical costs. That doesn’t include the time one would need to take off work, further tests, any aftercare not covered by the recipient’s insurance, any mental health treatment, or the rare case of negative side effects down the road. There’s a lot of privilege there for someone to be able to donate a kidney to a stranger. Yes, there are charities out there to help cover the extra costs, but they can only help so many. From the article, it doesn’t sound like Dorland understood those privileges and would get upset when no one acknowledged her “selfless” act.
Transformism
As artists, we “steal” from everyday life all the time, which was made clear in the bad art friend article. There are so many things we borrow from the world around us, the world we live in, the interactions with the people we meet, and even events we draw from. Larson drew inspiration from Dorland’s gift for her story and, aside from the letter, she transformed the story as much as the Campbell’s soup cans Andy Warhol painted. While anyone familiar with Dorland’s gift could contrive some similarities between the two, they were both completely different in their own right. That’s what transformism is. It’s taking a story or a picture and, instead of copying it as much as you can, you make it into something solely your own. While the plagiarism of Dorland’s letter was inexcusable and should never have happened, Larson had every right to write the story. Also, since Dorland shared her story semi-publicly, there was no real confidentiality to her story. If you don’t want your life to inspire the life and creativity of others, then you may want to build yourself a cabin in the woods and go off-grid. We all have a life to live. We connect with those around us. It’s selfish to keep a story to yourself that could truly touch the life of another.
Things said in private
One piece of advice I was given while growing up, that would’ve prevented some backlash in the bad art friend article, is to only write down things you’re okay with others knowing. There’s always a worry as kids that someone will read our diaries and discover our secrets. That worry lessens as our fears become unfounded. However, if there’s ever a reason that your texts, emails, and the like need to be pulled, then all those secrets will be discovered. That usually isn’t a worry for normal citizens, but in Larson’s case, it was. There were many things she said to those in her writing group that didn’t help her case once they were in the open. Larson blatantly admitted that she copied Dorland’s letter nearly verbatim. It also became apparent through the messages that no one in the group liked Dorland and believed she’d done the whole thing for likes. While I can’t speak for Dorland’s true reason behind her gift, I can remind you to take a moment to think before writing something in a private text or group chat. Perhaps meet in person or have video calls instead?There’s always a worry as kids that someone will read our diaries and discover our secrets… Click To Tweet
So, who is the bad art friend?
I believe that isn’t a question any of us can answer. We can have our opinions on it, but none of us can ever really judge who was “right” and “wrong” in this case. Maybe you believe that Dorland’s story was sacred and should never have been shared? Perhaps you think there’s nothing wrong about the whole thing and you’re wondering why everyone is up in arms about it. Or, perhaps, you’re wondering why Dorland hasn’t written about it herself. I think Larson put it most aptly: “I feel instead of running the race herself, she’s standing on the sidelines and trying to disqualify everybody else based on minor technicalities.”I think Larson put it most aptly: “I feel instead of running the race herself, she’s standing on the sidelines and trying to disqualify everybody else based on minor technicalities.” Click To Tweet

To reflect on ourselves, on our surroundings, on the people that surround us.
Surely by doing so we can then truly open our eyes to the world we live in. To the life we live.
I don’t believe we spend enough time doing this.
The benefits of self reflection are far greater than the time it would take to reflect.

Arad (Romania)
Straddling the Mures River and occupying parts of both the Crisana and the Banat provinces, Arad traces its history back to the 11th century. Arad developed as a major trading post during the Turkish occupation, between 1551 and 1699. After 1699, the city was ruled by the Habsburg Monarchy and in 1834 Arad was declared a ‘free royal town’ by Emperor Francis I of Austria.
Today, Arad is an important industrial centre, as well as home to two universities, a Romanian Orthodox theological seminary, a training school for teachers, and a music conservatory. Churches and cathedrals in the city span over four centuries, several denominations, and architectural styles ranging from baroque to neoclassic.
Unique aspects about Arad:

He pulled away in the final metres to take a convincing win over Rui Costa (UAE Abu Dhabi) and Jakob Fuglsang (Astana). “I think I can be happy with my performance. Normally I’m not an explosive kind of guy but this was something in between and it worked out well,” Fuglsang said after the stage. “From 500 metres you think, ‘Bah, the finish is just there,’ but it’s not like this. I know this climb from other years, where I attacked on the first part and you pay for that on the second small part here to the finish.”
“Even though it’s not so long, it’s super hard. I tried to do my best but it also throws in a bit of tactics when it’s such a big, open road and there’s wind,” he told Cyclingnews. “We needed to play it smart. I think Hermans, he came from behind in a good moment. Maybe he played it smarter or maybe he was stronger, but he showed good form already in Valencia, and he is for sure one of the guys to beat together with Rui Costa and a few others”. Climbing entered the picture in stage 2, with four classified climbs, including the stiff Al Jissah shortly before the finish.
It took a while for the day’s break group to form and several large groups tried to get away, but were brought back.
The field was flying along, at more than 50 km/h for the first hour but, at last after some 45 km, Mark Christian (Aqua Blue Sport) and Preben Van Hecke (Sport Vlaanderen-Baloise) finally got away. The field was happy to let them go and the gap rapidly hovered near the eight-minute mark.
The last three climbs came in the final third of the stage, and as the first of those appeared, the gap started coming down. With 40 km and two more climbs, it was down to three minutes and decreasing with regularity.
Van Hecke was caught with just over 20 km to go, and Christian fought on alone with a handful of seconds before succumbing to the peloton.
Best young rider Lasse Norman Hansen (Aqua Blue) attacked on the lead-up the final ranked climb, soon to be joined by Daniel Eaton (UnitedHealthcare). They carried 35 seconds up the fearsome Al Jissah, but were gathered in with only two kilometres to go.
A reduced and splintered peloton approached the finish line. Hermans moved away to take an easy win, with Costa and Fuglsang, his nearest chasers, fighting it out for the remaining podium positions, Cyclingnews reported. — ONA
#WinePW (wine pairing weekend) is about Midwest USA wines this weekend and I am so excited! Having lived in Missouri my entire life, I am thrilled that this team of bloggers is exploring my little bit of the world.
Missouri is home to our country's first AVA (American ViticulturalArea,) designated in 1980, and Augusta was the home to that distinction, beating out one Oregon and seven California applications. The Bureau cited Augusta's long wine history and German ties as some of the reasons it awarded the AVA to them. Napa Valley was the second AVA to be awarded. In 1870 France's vineyards were nearly completely destroyed by phylloxera louse. C.V. Riley, Missouri's first state entomologist, was among the first to discover that Native American grapes were resistant to the pest and Missouri then sent millions of phylloxera-resistant rootstock across the Atlantic, saving the French wine industry. I think we have a lot to be proud of here in Missouri!
I attended a webinar put on by the Missouri Botanical Gardens centered around the book called The Botanist and the Vinter by Christy Campbell. Amazon says this about the book:. Our panelists for the webinar were Dr. Dean Volenberg, Director of the Grape and Wine Institute at the University of Missouri, and Dr. Wendy Applequist, Associate Scientist at the Missouri Botanical Gardens. Both spoke about the role of Missouri in saving the French wine industry.
I chose to talk about a winery that is about 30 minutes from my home, Augusta Winery. It was founded in 1988 by Tony Kooyumjian and is located in the river town of Augusta, Missouri. It is nestled on the bluffs overlooking the Missouri River Valley. Wines in August are made in small quantities, which allows them to focus their attention on the details that help them win awards across the world. The winery has a wine terrace and a garden that has a 10-foot grapevine-covered arbor. The shop has items for any wine-lover, including me. I love to see their cute napkins and wine glasses. The drive to Augusta on Highway 94 is curvy and woodsy, perfect for my husband and me to drive the convertible to a slew of wineries that dot the road.
Augusta Winery has a summer concert series in July that features special wine cocktails, foods and of course, their Missouri wines.
I chose the Traminette to go with our Crab Rangoon burgers. It is a dry white that has aromas of peach, citrus, and honeysuckle. There is a nice finish which is refreshing with a hint of spiciness. You may have noticed our bottle was from 2016. Typically we wouldn't let this go this long, usually, three years is as long as you want to keep this wine. However, when we purchased it, the waiter said he thought this wine could go five years, so we marked it and yes, he was right! The wine was beautiful, probably too good to go with a burger. Thank goodness we decided to go up the burger game with a little crab rangoon!
Let's talk about the burgers a bit. We made bite-sized hamburgers that fit the French-style bread we had. We topped it with nice Provolone cheese, added a half slice of bacon and a dollop of crab rangoon spread. I added garlic aioli to mine. The dry wine was a great way to cut the richness of the burger and we enjoyed every bite! I added my favorite crab rangoon recipe below.

My mom lives in Missouri. I wonder if this place is near her.
That looks amazing. I've always wanted to visit Missouri too. Looks like a beautiful place.
I always hear Missouri in TV series, if I live there, no wonder I'll be proud too.
I was craving so much for crabs last night, I think this burgers would be the dish to ease it.
I had NO idea. And thanks, too, for the book recommendation. Just ordered it.
Wine tasting is another activity I enjoy a lot during the summer. Although this winery is far from me, it looks like so much fun
Being from Missouri, I had always heard the stories about the wine produced there. Thanks for more history about my home state.
I haven't attended wine pairing events but I do want to try it. Crab Rangoon sounds scrumptious.
I love the idea of adding crab rangoon filling to your burgers. How creative.
i will have to try the crab rangoon recipe. havent made it in a while
These burgers look so tasty! I would really love to check them out!
I love white wine and it's so good during summer especially with seafood! I am so curious to try Traminette wine.
We had crab rangoon before and it was so good. We ordered it from the restaurant, though. I will have to try your recipe sometime. -LYNNDEE
We all owe Missouri and C.V.Riley a big thank you for saving wine worldwide!
Yum! My husband loves crabs, so he would definitely enjoy those burgers 👌🏻 I have never visited a winery, would love to visit Augusta Winery someday when in Missouri.
Thanks,
Everything Enchanting
This post brings up lots of different fun memories for me. I lived in MO for several years as a kid, and my very first wine tasting experience was at MO winery my parents took us along to where they snuck us a taste of the wines. Crab Rangoon brings back lots of memories of late night eats in college. I'm definitely going to have to try this version and seek out some MO wines again!
I've recently got into different wines (it's so good after a long, hot summer day!) the Augusta Winery looks amazing! Thanks for sharing!sun phone.

FRENCH CHAR B1 REMOVER (War Thunder Tanks Gameplay)
If um correct the b1ter was called the france collosus cause it supirior amrour however cause of this it get destroyed by its side armour overheating by the friction of shells and fuel tank burning making it a bomb
The Marder III H picks apart this thing as well.
Along with any tank within its BR really….
Take out the T64A with HE shells only 🙂 47mm of penetration!
yo phly can I just use the regular pz 4 with the same round?
What do you mean “regular panzer 4?”
that tank fucking sucks phly, wtf are you smoking
You should do more low tier tanks then ur vids would be longer
Newb question. How do you adjust the distance marker when aiming?
Merry Christmas phly
I have been killing them with the marader III
Oh yea thanks Phly now im able of destroying those SUMABITCH
-_-
Tank games, without infantry, are just pointless
Yo play the suck fest that is the su 40
I use that round all the time on pz IV F1, especially on those pesky T-50s
all the Char players crying in their turrets because they thought they were invincible at 2.3
Play the USS Alabama
Low tier is the most fun you can have in War Thunder.
not 7.62 that’s russian the german’s used 7.92
Sturmpanzer > all ni🅱🅱a
Holy shit a war thunder ad on the video!
That Stuart with the tank driftu
Take out the kv1 zis 5 and stop the French bias.
Why are some videos just destroying a bit the game for a category of players.
He just made some videos like: german KV1B now i cannot play russians and americans at that BR range, fighting CAS with fighters( have matches with 6-7 enemy fighters), Conqueror video that now spamms campers with APDS, now this video.
I have no problem helping and giving tips, but just think that now u fuck the games of the B1 that already don’t have the best time.
I cannot play WT just bc u do videos on sth right when i am grinding and playing
The worst part about that Stuart killing u is If you had driven forwards and turned instead of backwards you woulda survived
Havnt seen T95 in a while how is it doing?
Phly you never did a video on the type 87!
Hey phly please make a video on the F3D Skynight that was added to the game, first time i give an idea for a video, hope he sees this
Ho yeah Commander Phly ! I’ll join the Hunt ! French tanks are Plague needed to be removed <3
5:33 reminds me of this meme about Star wars imperial troopers in Star Wars battlefront 2 EA
“Sector Clear”
* gets fired at *
“NOT CLEAR NOT CLEAR”
I already killed many B1’s with my Chi-Ha-Kai and Chi-He. I think Im good to go.
Phly can you play the Chi Nu II since you decided to do a low tier battle and enjoy them like me. Amazing 3.7 BR tank with 157mm cannon. Seal club t-34’s and NEVER been featured
I killed 3 char b1 ters in a t28
Also Phly, we need new Phly decal. When buying the B1 Ter, we dont get decal.
Did you just shoot down a friendly plane at 14:30 ?
Watching this as I am flying to a base in a Ju-87 D-3 in simulator.
Play the M 36 gmc
7:40 didnt know i was wathing fury
my dyslexia kicked in so hard that it made me think the Char B1 was removed XD
How do you do that when you range find the horizontal bar on the crosshair moves to the range you analyzed?
How to look around without the turret moving ?
Take out RU 251 and show us the new scouting mechanics please 🙂
For anyone complaining this is correct. Those paticular french tanks are ment to be that op armored for the teir. Thats how they were at the time they were made against other tanks at the time. Its the same way in world of tanks. Hardly anything can pen it. But its very slow and has a pretty small gun.
Guys what’s the best tactic with a Cobra King because I can’t get kills with it at all
British and French united time:
Play the Amx 13 SS.11 with a friend in a Strv 81, and make the rockets kill everybody. Try to get atleast 4 kills in 1 round only with rockets
#Attempt 1
‘Ter’ is not ‘tur’, it’s ‘tair’. Learn how to slaughter French with style, please 🙂
go just fucking t35 w pby a5 just fucking do it!’
The gepard is also really good at spamming those french things. I ended up first place four battles in a row and I am not a very good player.
I rarely see any people using this round, so the B1 Ter is completely amazing at this br
This thing is a beast in sim
my italy P40s time is NOW.I had such big plans for this week. In addition to the concert on Sunday with ASO of the Varese pieces, I really wanted to get a lot of work done on memorizing Lucrezia Borgia and getting the sucker into my voice. It lies low and heavy and is a great opportunity for me to liberally throw around my chest voice - something I rarely do in Mozart or even Rossini. The only problem is that the low heavy tessitura of the Donizetti lies in complete opposition to the high floaty tessitura of the Varese pieces, and I don't think it would be a good idea to practice all that heavy singing every day and then expect myself to float high b flats on Sunday afternoon (and at the rehearsals before). Add to this the fact that I woke up yesterday with a sore throat and am just waiting to see if this little illness turns into a full blown cold / upper respiratory infection or wanders away without making my life a living hell. So now I have to figure out how to learn this score just by looking at it.
Every singer has different methods of learning and memorizing music. I worked with someone recently who can just look at a score for several days without singing a note, and have it memorized before they even make a peep. I hate that person. I have no such photographic memory skills, although I am a pretty quick learner. Usually I teach myself the notes as fast as possible (the old fashioned way - by playing them on the piano and singing them lightly until my muscles/brain remember the order of the intervals). I like to get with a coach and sing it with them because I can memorize the music really quickly if I record my coachings and listen to them a few times. It's funny, I can't just listen to a recording of someone else singing my role and memorize it quickly, but something about listening to myself sing it gets it into my brain rather speedily. I'm sure there's some scientific brain study in the making about why that is - paging Oliver Sachs (he writes a lot about music and the brain). I was supposed to have a coaching on Lucrezia today to run through all of it and get it onto my ipod so I could listen to it a few times and not have to belt it out all week, but still get the whole thing in my memory. But I had to cancel the coaching because I didn't want to risk singing for an hour on a sore throat and getting laryngitis or something (which happened to me recently). So I just have to sit here and look at the score like my photographic memory friend and try to keep my brain from wandering and thinking about what I'm going to make for dinner later. Maybe I DO have a photographic memory, but it's just plagued with a lot of ADD. Yep, that's my excuse. Hmmm - what AM I gonna make for dinner? NO NO: Donizetti Donizetti DONIZETTI .....Spaghetti, linguini, rigatoni..? Ack. Never study when you're hungry.We’re midway through the year in music and liking what we’ve heard so far. We’re excited for what’s to come, but here at the midpoint, we’re taking pause to talk about our favorite releases of the first half of 2016.
Here’s Chad’s picks:
1. Money – Suicide Songs
2. Sasha – Scene 
3. Parquet Courts – Human Performance
4. Marissa Nadler – Strangers
5. eLDopamine – Sounds Like a Reasonable Thing for a Band to Play / Sleepy Seahorse – Frienditions / Thomas Paul – Singalongs
1. Money: Over the past 40 years, British songwriters have developed and refined their own unique strand of navel-gazing existentialism — equal parts wide-eyed wonder and gray-skied gloom. In song, they walk around a lot, folding inward as they peer outward, attempting to reconcile the two. It’s usually raining.
This dichotomy colors Suicide Songs, the second album from Manchester’s Money. Imagine if Conor wrote Lifted after an all-night bender of the Smiths, Stone Roses and the Verve. Emotive but not emo, serious but self-aware, Suicide Songs is the sound of a young person sorting out his shit against a backdrop of acoustic/electric guitars and velvety strings.
Like Lifted, some of the songs (the 8 1/2-minute “Night Came”) and song titles (“A Cocaine Christmas and an Alcoholic’s New Year”) are long because every word counts. It’s one of those records. And it’s the best thing I’ve pulled off the promo pile in a long time. Listen to “All My Life” here.
2. Sasha: The shelf life of a DJ/producer is similar to a tennis player — they typically peak young and retire early (or sadly hang on and fade away). Sasha, christened the “son of God” by a British music magazine during his ‘90s acid house heyday, is a rare exception, having stayed in the game for decades and maintained his relevancy.
In a career dotted with highlights, Scene Delete may be Sasha’s crowning achievement, but not for reasons you might expect. It hasn’t thrust him back into the superstar DJ realm or endeared him to the brostep-worshipping American EDM muggles. Instead, the album — released through the highly-regarded LateNightTales series — explores the cerebral, emotional side of Sasha’s aesthetic like nothing else in his catalog.
Though very much in the spirit of LateNightTales with its emphasis on noir beats, ambient textures and subtle melodic continuity, Scene Delete isn’t a DJ mix but rather 21 new Sasha tracks that function as a soundtrack to a contemplative post-club comedown. The album demonstrates that, like Radiohead, Sasha is adept at absorbing contemporary influences without coming off like a creatively-drained copycat. Enjoy a few tracks here.
3. Parquet Courts: That moment a band you believe in delivers the album you thought they had in them…
It doesn’t happen often. Potential, unfortunately, is rarely realized. But Human Performance feels like one of those moments when a good band becomes great, when they affirm their place in it all, when they’ve “arrived,” as it were, and delivered the album by which all past and future efforts will be judged.
I’ve been listening to Parquet Courts since 2012’s Light Up Gold, a wonderfully ramshackle record bristling with slacker-philosophy wit, art-punk energy and telling nods to Modern Lovers, Malkmus and many more in between. They’ve released an EP and/or full-length every year since (all of which are good or at least interesting in their own way), and Human Performance coalesces and distills the best bits of those records into one fantastic, fully-realized album. Check out “Berlin Got Blurry” here.
4. Marissa Nadler: Certain music, by virtue of its intimacy or obscurity (or both), feels like a secret. Some secrets you want to share, some you want to keep. It depends. On the album, on the artist, on the day.
We’ve been playing Marissa Nadler’s music in the store for nearly a decade now, yet an air of hushed tones stubbornly remained until she played a Thursday afternoon in-store in early July.
We told our friends, we told our customers: Don’t miss this one; you’d be foolish to miss this one. And afterward, they responded in kind: How did I not know about her before?!, etc. Having seen her first-ever Boise show the night before at Neurolux, we knew the in-store would be special, knew we’d be saying see, told you so afterward. But even our familiarity with Nadler couldn’t prepare us for how good it was.
Nadler’s new album Strangers, her seventh, is similarly affecting. Touted as a less-insular, more outwardly-looking album, Strangers favors character studies over personal reflection, the imagery no less evocative than Nadler’s goth-folk confessionals. Musically, Nadler colors the arrangements with electric guitar and synths, but still leaves space for moments of striking interplay between her 12-string acoustic and arresting mezzo-soprano.
Before Nadler hit the road, we snagged copies of her two self-released (and hard-to-find) albums to stock in the store. Here’s a secret: They’re worth hearing, too.
5. eLDopamine/Sleepy Seahorse/Thomas Paul: Not a three-way tie for last, mind you, but a means of cheating/grouping releases to wedge a couple more titles into my Top 5.
Though disparate in sound and style, there are personal connections in play here: John O’Neil of eLDopamine and Joey Corsentino of Sleepy Seahorse are coworkers (and coworkers of mine) at The Record Exchange; Thomas Paul is in eLDopamine and a Record Exchange alumnus. I see all of them nearly on a daily basis. All of this, of course, is beside the point when it comes to the music.
O’Neil reignited eLDopamine for Treefort and recorded/released a new 7-song EP in conjunction with their festival appearance (a Top 5 of 2016 in its own right). As a purposeful EP (as opposed to a thoughtless collection of castoffs to satiate the marketplace), it leaves you wanting more, until you realize this brief blast of Crazy Horse country-punk is just right. To steal from one critic, “it’s nimble, kinetic and to the point, like the sudden whirl of a street fight.”
Sleepy Seeds’ self-titled album was one of my favorites of 2014. Sleepy Seahorse is a sister act of sorts, an outlet for Corsentino’s solo work that kinda sorta turned into a full band (at least briefly) for Treefort this year. Joey and his wife had a baby last year, and he’s learning what that means for a songwriter and performer. Judging from Frienditions, he’s striking a good balance. Recorded at home in his “spare” time (i.e. while the baby slept), it features nine inventive reworkings of some of his favorite songs from Idaho musicians. These sorts of things rarely work. But Frienditions does. Very, very well.
Thomas Paul has the type of voice that makes doves cry. As a self-imposed challenge, he decided to silence it for Singalongs, his first full (winkingly-titled) instrumental album. Recorded live in a hotel room during the 2015 Modern Art (no overdubs!), Singalongs is captivating mood music, cinematic and noir, that showcases Paul’s oft-overlooked talents — composing and arranging.

Vision
Maximizing human potential by building bridges that drive inclusion, innovation, development, and empowerment.
Mission
My mission is to leverage the transformative power of story-telling, comedy, music, arts, and creative teaching and programming to foster healing, learning, engagement, collaboration, and equity, in groups, organizations, communities, and society.
Key Strategies
Harness the power of individuals to foster the greater good
Inspire action and individual commitment to Inclusion, Diversity, and Equity and the greater good.
- Leverage grassroots movements, organizations, and the power of each individual to positively impact their immediate spheres of influence and their communities and society at large.
Promote a culture of solidarity, not charity; develop allies, not saviors.
Creatively generate awareness about systemic issues and the invisible structural barriers hindering individual, organizational, and societal progress.
Enlighten people on the imperative of collective justice & equity in addition to individual kindness.
Highlight the disconnect between personal and interpersonal systems of inclusion, and organizational and societal systems of inclusion.
Leverage organizations to foster the greater good
70% of the US population is in the workforce and the workforce is usually the most diverse establishment and rapidly continues to become more diverse. This provides an immense opportunity to create breeding grounds for building bridges across feuding groups in communities and society, thus increasing understanding, collaboration, and prosperity.
Leverage the financial power of organizations to provide substantive inclusion, diversity, and equity trainings and programs for all their employees. Changing organizational culture can change societal culture. Positively transformed employees not only become better workers, but also become better family members, community members, and advocates.
Help corporations engage not just in building a more inclusive and equitable workforce, but also in building more inclusive, engaged, and equitable communities and world.
Partner with organizations to cultivate diverse talent pipelines and provide valuable inclusion, diversity, and equity trainings and tools for community members.News Library
In El Salvador, Facebook subscribers “like” project workforce development efforts
Carlos Marroquin, Communications Manager for the USAID Program to Improve Access to Employment, says "We are successfully using Facebook as a meeting place for our target audience and a space where we share information on the subject that concerns us all: employment.”Talk about your social impact: In El Salvador, USAID’s Program to Improve Access to Employment (managed by CARANA) is setting new standards for magnifying its workforce development efforts through social media. When 2012 started, the program’s Facebook page had 113 subscriptions (“likes” in Facebook lingo). As of the end of June, “likes” have surged to 13,000, thanks to the program’s online interaction with beneficiaries.
The first step to Program Communications Manager Carlos Marroquin’s proactive social media strategy was making content more atractive and useful. The previously text-heavy layout is livened up with video testimonials and photo collages of participants, as well as interviewing and résumé-preparing tips for job seekers. To get the word out about this resource, the project made a small financial commitment of $10 a day to run ads within Facebook and attract attention to the page.
The project’s Facebook page now houses free announcements of upcoming job and professional development opportunities to draw in potential project participants. Three to four times a month, the project hosts open audition-style gatherings where people can enter free pre-training programs to build their “soft,” personal communications skills, after which they are invited to interview with a designated employer. On average, 25 people attend each gathering—six of whom learned about it on Facebook. Marroquin calls the platform his “main information and summoning tool.”
The page is also helping the project cement relationships with organizations like the Chamber of Commerce and Industry of El Salvador and the Development Bank of El Salvador, which forward its postings to their own subscribers. Individuals do the same; for example, 18 people shared the announcement of Walmart’s career fair with their own networks, widening outreach exponentially.
Hear Alexander’s story (in Spanish) of how the USAID program’s use of social media helped him find employment at Pollo Campero, a popular fast-food chain.
Project Director Beto Brunn says the page allows them to more directly inform youth—especially those at-risk—about employment opportunities: “We need to give them hope, and the new media allows those we are benefitting to share their stories. The general message is that there are good options that can help high school graduates with few prospects for university find work and a meaning for their lives.”
Brunn added that the page is also helping break down employer myths. “In San Miguel, for instance, the business consensus is that youths don’t want to work because they are receiving remittances,” he says. The program organized a recruiting event to find cell phone salespeople, advertised through a Facebook post seen by 3,800 people across the nation. “We hoped perhaps 40 youths would come; 76 actually arrived—to the amazement of everyone. We had to move into the backyard.”
The USAID Program to Improve Access to Employment strengthens El Salvador’s workforce by developing the skills the labor market demands, particularly for youth and marginalized populations. Before engaging the public in an open conversation about the project, USAID’s program tested the waters of social media with Joven360, an online platform it developed to help undergraduate youth obtain their first professional experience through posted internships and job applications.
USAID’s Program to Improve Access to Employment is now experimenting with Twitter (@AccesoEmpleo) where it already has almost 250 followers.

Expectations
Joy has been defined by leading experts with opposing views and confusion about happiness. Emotion is assigned with a predominance for negative traits. Laughter and play have often been trivialized as being unrealistic for a busy word and breath isn't typically appreciated until we struggle for it.
Understanding that energy is matter and change is constant and something we move all the time has emerged from the "Woo-Woo" category to begin to be appreciated for something different.
As the status quo of current consensus for a busy, overstressed world begins to emerge and look for something better, this weekend offers a new lens of appreciation to educate, apply. and realize the natural quality of what can fill the song of your soul. Let this weekend offer you an uplifting and pleasant realization of your abilities.

The Design Process
The successful design of a building is a creative challenge which is daunting without skilled guidance. PPG/AIA provides that expertise from the design process and through construction. Several professional attributes separate us from our competitors; these are the cornerstones of successful architectural design.
Communication:
We know how to listen to a client and can convert a wish list into architecture that is expressive of high quality design and the Owners priorities and needs. The Client is thus an essential part of the design team while the firm offers reasoned, creative strategies to achieve an owners goals.
Professional Competence:
Our firm possesses abundant design talent and technical skills with a practical approach to the architectural solution. We routinely incorporate concepts of energy efficiency, sustainability and building green into our solutions. We understand the need for adequate detailed construction documents so vital to convey the information to the contractor and minimize misunderstandings.
Versatility:
We believe quality design is not limited by a particular style of architecture. Quality Design is the result of careful analysis of need, desire and possibilities with an eye to aesthetics and suitability to an individual client and budget. Site considerations such as orientation, view, primary wind and solar impacts are given careful consideration. No two projects are the same although we embrace certain concepts such as casual elegance, openness of spaces and enhancement of views. We believe light, airiness and exterior views are all important to creating a residence which is timeless and a pleasure to live in.

Article by Pierre-YvesEnvironment: Visual C++ 6
So you want to use the new style of dialog where you pick an option from a tree on the left and the appropriate form shows up on the right, but you have no idea where to start.
The easiest way to set up the right side is to create a dialog for each form that you might use there. The trick is making it seamless with the overall dialog, and switching out the dialogs (the forms) that you create for that right-hand side.
Step 1: Create the Main Dialog.
Easy enough. Use the Resource Editor to create the dialog, and stretch it out a bit. Add a Tree View control to the left-hand side, making it tall and skinny so that it’s readable but there’s plenty of room for whatever is going to go on the right. Use Class Wizard to add a Member Variable for the control.
Step 2: Create the Right Side forms.
In the Resource Editor, select Insert>>Resource (or hit ctrl-R), select Dialog, and click New. Design as you please. Run Class Wizard (ctrl-W) to create a class for the dialog. At some point set these properties on the dialog itself:
- Style must be Child (this is on the Styles tab)
- Border (Styles tab again) should be none, but you can play with this. Keep in mind that if you do give it a border, you’ll probably want to make sure all the dialogs you create for the right side are the same size so that the border doesn’t shift about.
- Speaking of size, you’ll want to size the right-hand dialogs carefully so that they’ll fit in the Main Dialog with room left over for the tree control. There are rulers at the top and left when designing dialogs to help you accomplish this.
Create as many right-side dialogs as you want.
Step 3: Initialize the dialogs
Ah, here we get to some code! In the Dlg class for your application, add include’s for each of your right-side dialog classes. For ease (and because it’s what they are), I’m going to call those Child Dialogs. Add a member variable to your Dlg header for each of your Child Dialogs. In the OnInitDialog function of your Dlg class, Create and Hide the Child Dialogs:
// Create the Child Dialogs
m_dlgOption1.Create(IDD_DIALOG_OPTION1, NULL);
m_dlgOption1.ShowWindow(SW_HIDE);
m_dlgOption2.Create(IDD_DIALOG_OPTION2, NULL);
m_dlgOption2.ShowWindow(SW_HIDE);
m_iActiveOption = 1;
// Create the tree.
HTREEITEM hItem;
hItem = m_tMyTree.InsertItem(“Option 1”,
TVI_ROOT,
TVI_LAST);
m_tMyTree.SelectItem(hItem);
m_hCurrentItem = hItem;
m_tMyTree.InsertItem(“Option 2”,
TVI_ROOT,
TVI_LAST);
m_tMyTree.SetFocus();
return FALSE; // returning FALSE so the focus is
// set to the tree.
}
Note that I have also created a member variable m_hCurrentItem to track the currently selected item. This is of type HTREEITEM.
Step 4: Handle a Change In The Tree’s Selection
Using Class Wizard, create a handler for your tree control to handle the TVN_SELCHANGED message. The function should look something like this:
void CDialogSwitcherByTreeDlg::OnSelchangedTree1(NMHDR* pNMHDR,
LRESULT* pResult)
{
NM_TREEVIEW* pNMTreeView = (NM_TREEVIEW*)pNMHDR;
HTREEITEM hItem;
CString szOptionChosen;
hItem = m_tMyTree.GetSelectedItem(); // Get a Handle to the
// newly selected item.
m_hCurrentItem = hItem; // Set the current item to the one
// just selected.
szOptionChosen = m_tMyTree.GetItemText(hItem); // Get the text of
// the chosen option.
if (szOptionChosen == “Option 1”) // If option 1 was chosen…
{
m_iActiveOption = 1; // Set the active option to 1,
// hide option 2, repaint.
m_dlgOption2.ShowWindow(SW_HIDE);
OnPaint();
}
else if (szOptionChosen == “Option 2”) // If option 2 chosen…
{
m_iActiveOption = 2; // Set the active option to 2,
// hide option 1, repaint.
m_dlgOption1.ShowWindow(SW_HIDE);
OnPaint();
}
*pResult = 0;
}
Of course, my example here uses only 2 options and it’s pretty simple to set up an if-else if structure. For more than a few options you might want to get creative and figure a more efficient way of doing changing the current selection.
Notice that I call OnPaint() as soon as my option is chosen. This is because I have put some code into the OnPaint() function to complete the transition from one Child Dialog to another:
RECT rPositionMain; // Main Dialog rectangle
RECT rPositionChild; // Child Dialog rectangle
int iXDiff = 0; // Left-Right change
int iYDiff = 0; // Up-Down change
GetWindowRect(&rPositionMain); // Get the rectangle
// the dialog occupies
switch (m_iActiveOption) // Based on the button pushed…
{
case 1:
m_dlgOption child…
m_dlgOption1.MoveWindow(&rPositionChild,
TRUE); // …make the move!
m_dlgOption1.ShowWindow(SW_SHOW); // Show the child dialog
break;
case 2:
m_dlgOption the child…
m_dlgOption2.MoveWindow(&rPositionChild,
TRUE); // …make the move!
m_dlgOption2.ShowWindow(SW_SHOW); // Show the child dialog
break;
}
// Bold the current item, turn Bold off for the rest
// of the tree items.
HTREEITEM hItem = m_tMyTree.GetFirstVisibleItem();
while (hItem != NULL)
{
if (hItem == m_hCurrentItem)
m_tMyTree.SetItemState( hItem, TVIS_BOLD, TVIS_BOLD );
else
m_tMyTree.SetItemState( hItem, 0, TVIS_BOLD );
hItem = m_tMyTree.GetNextVisibleItem(hItem);
}
Again, if you have more than a very few options you might want to work out a more graceful way of parsing them besides if-else if.
The important part of what I do in OnPaint() is moving the Child Dialog around. Since we set the style of each of the Child Dialogs to be Child, the coordinates used will be relative to their parent window, which is our main dialog. Initially, these coordinates are going to be wrong (Windows sets them relative to the screen), but after one trip through OnPaint() they should be fine. Theoretically, the window positions should only be adjusted once, but it’s better to be safe than sorry.
Note that I offset the left side of the Child Dialogs by 150 pixels to allow room for the tree control. Depending on the width of your tree control, you may have to adjust this.
So there you have it: A tree control that changes the forms that show up on the dialog. Since each of the Child Dialogs are their own classes, the Main Dialog doesn’t have to worry about what happens in them.

“A responsible budget is not our only weapon to control inflation. We must act now to protect all Americans from healthcare costs that are rising $1 million per hour, 24 hours a day, doubling every 5 years. We must take control of the largest contributor to that inflation – skyrocketing hospital costs.”
Would you be surprised to learn that those words came out of the mouth of…Jimmy Carter? It might be hard to remember, but Carter was essentially a fiscally conservative Democrat. Probably more fiscally conservative than Ronald Reagan was during his presidency. But in any case, Carter’s entire vision of healthcare reform was to control healthcare costs. Not a vision easy to get many people excited about, as Paul Ryan has no doubtedly discovered more recently. That might explain why Jimmy Carter got nowhere in reforming the U.S. healthcare system.Satellite Phone Helps Rescue 82 From Ocean
Wednesday, 19 September 2012 10:21 IsatPhone Pro from a vessel requesting assistance.
"RCC Australia successfully contacted the satellite telephone number and a person on board reported the vessel's engine was not working and there were 82 people on board. At this stage, the vessel's unconfirmed location was south of Java," explained AMSA's spokesperson Jo Meehan.
RCC Australia sent out a distress broadcast to the area to call for assistance despite an an initial discrepancy over the vessel's GPS position until Inmarsat confirmed from satellite phone positional information that the vessel was approximately 31nm south of Java.
An AP3 Orion maritime patrol aircraft, spotted the vessel and three merchant ships who had responded to the earlier broadcast were diverted to the scene, followed shortly after by Australian Navy vessels HMAS Glenelg and HMAS Childers.
The MV Clipper Mayflowerassisted in the rescue of two injured people from the water, while the remaining 80 people were taken on board the Defence vessels for transfer to Christmas Island, for security, health and identity checks while their reasons for travel are being established.
Inmarsat's maritime safety manager Peter Blackhurst said: "Our relationship with RCCs globally, of which we are extremely proud, has been developed over the years. It enables both parties to quickly pass essential information when required - once again Inmarsat communications was the conduit that enabled lives to be saved."

Hope might be all someone has. I would never criticize someone for ending a relationship with an addict. Sometimes your life calls for self preservation and removing toxic people. You might lose the desire to be involved in someone's life. You might end a relationship due to pain and anger. But, to lose hope for someone's health and recovery is not the correct response.
We all make jokes about how people set resolutions on January 1st and they sometimes end on January 2nd. The fact is-it is hard to make changes. In the case of addiction, it sometimes feels impossible.
I have a friend who has been married to an alcoholic for 20 years. He relapsed after rehab and has been drinking hard for about a year after a quick stint of sobriety. She turned to me and said, "I think I am done. I think I've lost hope. Should I have hope?"
I don't know a lot about a lot. But, this I know. You should never lose hope. Hope should exist in presence of an addict and in absence. You can stop loving someone. You can choose to distance yourself. But, you should always have hope that someone will recover. Until the person is dead, there is always hope. Sometimes the hope you have in someone is the only thing they have.
There's hope.Everyone has heard of Colonial Williamsburg with its dozens of buildings from the late-17th to mid-19th centuries. But it’s not real, folks! Although few people have heard of New Castle, Delaware, it has almost as many buildings from that same era and real people live there. Okay, they’re not dressed up like Revolutionaries, but the history there is even more…well, historic. It’s a genuine Colonial town but without the colonists. The town is replete with houses that used to be taverns, blacksmith shops, stables, ship repair shops during the war. The industries of this working class Colonial town may have shuttered but the structures remain.
No, wait, I’m being told by Brian Cannon, the Historic Site Lead Interpreter: Do not compare New Castle with Colonial Williamsburg, though that was the hook that originally got me there. CW, as Cannon not-so-affectionately refers to the tourist town, is frozen in July 1776 and its many buildings built over many centuries have been “restored” to that hallowed place in history. They’re what are not real.
New Castle, on the other hand, Cannon explains, “is a continuously occupied community containing over 500 buildings spanning four centuries of Colonial, Federal and Victorian architecture.” He adds: “We celebrate our historic diversity. CW has no historic diversity.” Admonished, I move on.
Fortunately, New Castle is replete with history unrelated to the Revolutionary War, as well. William Penn, of nearby Pennsylvania fame, first set foot on American soil here is October 1682. At an alleyway called Penn’s Place — no surprise there — is found the oldest building foundation in town which dates its original construction back to Penn’s arrival. Take that, Williamsburg! You can’t get more authentic than that.

Fast forward a half-century to 1732 when the Old Courthouse was built. Of course, it was later updated. The modern renovations? The new steps put in in 1845, right about the time Thomas Garrett and his pal, Harriet Tubman, were hustling runaway slaves to freedom via the Underground Railroad, whose many stations ran right through neighboring Wilmington. Garrett, Tubman’s right-hand man and “head stationmaster,” was tried for just such activities in the New Castle Courthouse in 1848. The presiding judge? Conservative Supreme Court Justice Roger Taney of the Dred Scott decision fame denigrating the Constitutional rights of African-Americans. Not surprisingly, he ruled against the abolitionist, bankrupting him. Garrett’s reply: “Judge, thou has left me not a dollar, but I wish to say to thee and to all in this courtroom that if anyone knows a fugitive who wants a shelter and a friend, send him to Thomas Garrett and he will befriend him.” Pretty impressive courthouse to this day!

And yes, there is also a Revolutionary War connection. On June 15, 1776, the Delaware Assembly meeting in the same courthouse declared independence from Great Britain, predating the rest of the country. Williamsburg didn’t catch up for another month! Somehow these comparisons are hard to avoid.
Further American history abounds everywhere, with several houses of famous people over several centuries dotting the streets. And the cemetery at the Immanual Episcopal Church, founded in 1689, is home to its own well-known clientele, many of whom lived in those houses. Gravesites from the early 1700’s to the present-day, of Founding Fathers to state governors, generals from the War of 1812 and Civil War to WWI and WWII veterans. The past brought into the present in a beautiful peaceful setting that does justice to both.

Two of the oldest houses in New Castle include the original framing structure of the Dutch House on East Third Street, which dates from 1690-1700 and is the best example of an intact original period dwelling, and No. 8 The Strand which was built as a much smaller brick house around 1690.

Williamsburg can’t boast such early architectural edifices. And another several hundred homes cover multiple centuries and architectural styles, with close to a hundred spanning the 17th-19th century time frame. Did I mention the cobblestone streets upon which I was sure the sounds of stagecoaches still reverberate?

A visit to Jessup’s Tavern and Colonial Restaurant: more confusion, more confirmation. The sign stating that it is now home to the largest selection of Belgian beers in Delaware, despite the Dutch, Swedish and British flags flying overhead, was jarring. I’m pretty sure that’s not one of the more famous legacies of the Revolutionary — or any other American –War. But once inside, impressions change. Beer of any country served in a crock mug somehow tastes better that way. Several flavors of “Colonial” ice cream are a sweet testimonial to the Colonists if not in reality a favored dessert. And although there are indeed dishes on the Bill of Fare representative of all the flags –- and therefore history of New Castle — it is the English pub fare and candle-lit ambience that pre-dominate.

So yes, very much the feel of an 18th-century tavern. And how would I know? Well, okay — I experienced one in Williamsburg. Admittedly, the USB charger in the center of the napkin holder was somewhat disorienting. But as we were leaving, I spotted a Revolutionary War musket on the wall — somehow that made me feel better. But shhhh – don’t tell Mr. Cannon. For more information about New Castle, visit..Guestbook

Check in isn’t until 5:30pm but they still accommodated us to drop our bags. This is an apartment used as a BnB. Petit dejeuner each morning was delicious. Host was so gracious and accommodating.

« Excellent location for french stay in heart of Bordeaux »
Location was amazing, tram a few minutes walk, shopping around the corner, cafes & bistros close by and walking to tourist spots very easy! We enjoyed sharing the lounge and kitchen facilities with another tourist couple, but were completely private in our own room with ensuite, breakfast was special & personal, the french atmosphere & decor in our apartment was lovely & typically french apartment style! For a truly french experience I would recommend these premises!

The vehicle was presented by Isabel Díaz Ayuso, President of the region
In the words of Isabel Díaz Ayuso, President of Madrid Region: “Today a transport revolution begins”. The optimistic tone was inspired by the announcement that a hydrogen bus will be set in motion to transport passengers on the roads of the Henares Corridor – the first such vehicle to officially operate in Spain.
Initially and until the last quarter of the year, the bus will run as a trial run, with the idea of it being the pioneer and precursor of what is to become a wide-spread mode of transportation later on. It was reported that the bus will be operated by ALSA, a transport company that provides interurban and regional scheduled passenger services in Madrid, as well as in Spain.
The vehicle in question is a Caetano H2 bus, which is 12 metres long and equipped with a low floor for better accessibility, three double access doors and a capacity to carry 62 passengers, including a space for people with reduced mobility. What makes it interesting and unique, however, is what will propel it forward.
A hydrogen fuel cell will feed the electric powered engine, giving it a distinct advantage over other buses, both of the traditional and alternative fuel varieties. It is designed to emit no carbon dioxide into the atmosphere and only water vapours – the result of the process in the hydrogen fuel cell. It is also reported to be practically noiseless, which combined with the previous feature earns it the distinction of a ‘zero pollution’ vehicle, meaning that it creates no air nor noise contamination.
It compares favourably to electric buses as well because its battery provides a longer range – 400 kilometres with a single charge. And recharging the fuel cell battery will take the same time as recharging an electrical bus.
The Government of Madrid informed that the Regional Transport Consortium already has 28% of its fleet converted to alternative fuel vehicles, running on natural gas or electrical power. However, this new vehicle and a driverless bus trial running on the Cantoblanco campus of the Autonomous University of Madrid, are set to completely transform the idea of transportation and mobility.The latest IPCC special report discusses the potential impacts of global warming of 1.5 °C and presents several pathways scenarios but without focusing much on the need of protecting and sustainably managing the forests we currently have.
You have probably heard or read that during the last days the IPCC – the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change – issued a new report evaluating the impacts of 1.5°C of global warming. I read several posts and opinion on this, and I was also positively impressed by the fact that the results of the report have been discussed in the front page of many medias. However, when I looked at the document I found myself slightly disappointed because I frankly expected it to strongly highlight the role of forests as the main ‘weapon’ to sequester carbon from the atmosphere, as well as the importance of using sustainably yielded forest products for stocking carbon in form of long-lived products, such as wooden buildings and structures.
The document calls for drastic actions that human societies should undertake to reduce the effects of climate change. Among them, it mentions the use of bioenergy products, forest restoration and large-scale replanting, as well as the need to capture and storage carbon from the atmosphere using new technology – so called Bioenergy with carbon capture and storage (BECCS). However, it seems to me that the report minimizes the impact healthy forests and sustainable forest management can have in the battle against global warming and increasing CO2 emissions. Instead, multiple scenarios were presented in which negative emission technologies are applied making a large use of BECCS. Only the first scenarios consider afforestation alone as the main option for Carbon Dioxide Removal (CDR).
Recently, I stumbled upon an interesting article on negative emission technologies, discussing that to really make an impact against the tonnes of CO2 emitted every day, negative emission technologies “must be shown to work on a gigaton scale, at an affordable cost, and without serious environmental impacts”. Nevertheless, that has not happened yet because, among others, the costs of direct air captures, which so far have been tested only at small scales, are on the order of hundreds of dollars or more per ton of CO2. Essentially, we are far way from their massive implementation at global scale.
I am hoping that negative emission technology will soon be an affordable and widespread reality, but at the current time we only have one proven natural technology that works for removing and storing atmospheric CO2 at planetary scale: forests. And I am not talking only about planting new forests or restoring patches of forests where previously harvested. I also include sustainable forest management and strategic actions that are needed to maintain healthy forests ecosystems. This, I believe, is what was missing from the IPCC report. Not only the fact to avoid deforestation and increase afforestation but improve the management of forests so they would be more resistant and resilient to disturbances (e.g., forest fires) know to suddenly release large amount of carbon to the atmosphere.
To increase this awareness, a pool of forest scientists prepared a response letter to the report pointing out that many of the technological carbon-capture solutions reported in the latest IPCC report are unverified, while forest sequestration is a well known and proven technology to fix atmospheric carbon in biomass and soils. The letter also remarks that “bioenergy as such is not the primary solution because achieving significant amounts of carbon dioxide removal through use of wood for energy and capturing the resulting carbon in geological reservoirs requires technology that is untested at large scale”. And I totally agree with that! The use of wood and other biomasses for heating and energy production is certainly a way to go, but as many studies shown they are not fully carbon neutral (and in some cases, such as the transport of wood pellets from where is produced in America to the household stoves where is burned in Europe, production and transport costs cause higher carbon emissions than conventional methods).
This letter concludes that “we must protect and maintain healthy forests to avoid dangerous climate change and to ensure the world’s forests continue to provide services critical for the well-being of the planet and ourselves”. For this reason, I would have loved to see different IPCC scenarios for different levels of forest management worldwide, and not only considering afforestation as CDR option.
No doubt that this IPCC report, together with the Paris Agreement, represents a turning point in the acknowledgement of the potential, devastating impacts of human induced climate change around the world. However, I hope that next time the role of forests and of sustainable forest management will be in the front page.
As a forest scientist, I believe we should keep working on increasing the awareness and application of climate-conscious forest management strategies. Most importantly, I think that management actions should be harmonized within forest landscapes across the globe, therefore it is crucial seeing forests with a multi-scale perspective, from tree to landscape. We also should not forget to favor the use of sustainable timber and their by-products for building structure and long-lived products.

***Lifetime Access on all my classes!
!
To give you an idea of the layout of the course, here's how I've it broken down:
week 1: Searching
We will get inspired by building inspiration boards of color palettes, textures, and lines, form, and animals.
week 2: Gathering
We will start building libraries of words, symbols, marks, and textures.
week 3: Backgrounds and painted papers
We will explore the beauty of the background. We will create painted papers to use as collage in our paintings. We'll also implement our libraries at this point.
week 4: the Face - color and dimension
I will show you how I paint faces using color to give dimension to the face.
Week 5: The animal and finish up
I'll demo ways of adding animals to your painting.
Pinterest: We will be utilizing Pinterest for a holding spot for our inspirations. If you haven't already signed up for Pinterest, consider doing that now or a couple weeks before the class starts to familiarize yourself with it. Beware! it can be addictive!
FAQ's
I have never painted before. Will I be able to do what's put forth in this class?
You bet! This class is perfect for the beginner as well as those who have been painting a while. I have found, after taking online and in-person workshops like this, that I have felt more comfortable and learned SO much more than taking the scholarly route at University.
I like to work at my own pace. How long will the workshop remain open?
I will leave you access to the workshop up until December 1st, 2012 for you to go back and work or re-watch any video demos. Also please feel free to download any of the videos for your own private viewing. I also encourage you to print out any of the text you'd like.
Can I share the password to the class with my friends or family?
I would kindly ask that you not share the password to the videos with anyone. Only 1 user for each registration please.
Can I use different colors than what you demo?
Sure! Feel free to use colors that you are drawn to....in the backgrounds as well as the face. I challenge you though, to use at least one neon or bright color that you don't normally think to use. It can be beautiful in small doses!
Is it important that I am on Pinterest?
Pinterest is an important tool in this workshop and it basically just makes it easier to bookmark your inspiration images. You don't have do it but it certainly makes it easier to share your inspiration boards with folks. You could also have a physical inspiration board (i have a big cork board) that you could collect and photograph...then share.
Can I get a refund if I pay for the course and decide not to use it?
I'm sorry, but there are no refunds after payment is sent.
I tend to paint too tight or neat, will I be able to loosen up?
You have come to the right place! No tidyness here......
The process of my painting style and teaching will help (and possibly force) you to loosen up. No thinking. Just doing!
Can I sell my work that I make in the course?
Will there be written instructions to download for me to keep?
The only downloadable pdf will be a step-by-step instructions for painting a face (also included in the zine). You are welcome to print out the text in the classroom blog to refer to for later use. I like to think of my workshop as a process of painting rather than a step-by-step instructional to complete a project. As you continue to work, the intuitive process will start to make sense in your daily painting practice.

Flatport length issues
DuikKees posted a topic in Photography Gear and TechniqueHi I am struggeling a bit with the length of my flatportcombination with the 105VR2. I have the impression that there is too much space in front of the lens for the optimum use of wet diopters. I have a Nauticam D750 housing and I now use a compact base, 20mm extension and the 30 compact port. The effective internal length from base to glass is 90mm. Since the 105 sticks 80mm out in front of the housing, there is a full 1cm room between lens and port glass. Couple of questions: 1. Is this too much (for the use of wet diopters)? 2. There is a dedicated port for the 105. The macro port 87. What is the exact internal length of this port? Is this 87mm?

Difference close up lens and macro converter
DuikKees replied to germie's topic in Photography Gear and TechniqueI am in for a new closup lens, probably the SMC-2. But I have a Nauticam house with the compact 30 port with extensions. This flatport doesn't have a 67mm thread on the end. I can't find a flipadapter that does fit on this port. Do you have a solution how to fit the SMC-2 on this port?
Comparing large domes for FX
DuikKees replied to Akulamd's topic in Photography Gear and TechniqueThe problem is to find out what the optimum extension is. Especially when you mix brands, it is an issue. I just bought a used Sea&Sea FE-dome (S&S 56401) to use with the 16-35 on my Nauticam housing. I asked Nauticam what the correct extension should be, but they didn't responded at all. At the store we compared the Nauticam 8,5" dome and it appears very similar to the Sea&Sea, so we decided to use the same extension as Nauticam recommends with the 8,5" dome. I have not tried it in the water yet.
- Little bump on this thread: That is not nessecary. Most SLR's you can set on interval timer shooting and let it fire away as long as you want.
Extension Nauticam 16-35
DuikKees posted a topic in Photography Gear and TechniqueHi, I use the D750 in a Nauticam housing. I recently purchased a Sea&Sea 9,7" dome mainly to use with the 16-35 f4. What extension is recommended for this lens? The portchart from Nauticam says 90mm with the 9,5" Nauticam dome, but I also see others using the 70mm extension with this lens. Kees

D7000 noise performance
DuikKees replied to cor's topic in Photography Gear and TechniqueTo D7000 or not. Like so many, I am actually waiting for the D800, but that can easy take another year. So, what to do? My D80 is realy getting at age, and the performance of D7000 is very interesting. So I made a quick comparisson in PS, and I see enough possibilities to fit the D7000 in a D80-housing. I think I will have a try, once I have my hands on a D7000.
D800?
DuikKees replied to cor's topic in Photography Gear and TechniqueSame here with my D80 But: "The announcement should be in Summer of 2011" that means housings by the end of 2011. That's a long time... but I think I will wait for this one and not to go for the D7000.
Is this the FX eqivalent of the DX10-17?
DuikKees replied to John Bantin's topic in Photography Gear and TechniqueYou still can use the 10-17 on FF. If you shave off the hood, there is no vingetting from 13mm. Just do a Google on "lens shave 10-17" and you will find what you need. Good luck shaving

The most delicate aspect of the selection procedure is interview. The information about the candidate which cannot be obtained from the application blank, tests and group discussion can be obtained if the interview is planned well in advance and is conducted by the interviewer tactfully.
According to Strauss & Sayles, “An interview is a selection technique which enables employer to view the total individual and directly appraise his behaviour. It is the method by which an idea about the applicant’s personality can be obtained by a face to face contact.”
ADVERTISEMENTS:
Scott Clothier fie Spriegel write “An interview is a purposeful exchange of ideas, the answering of questions and communication between two or more persons.” Yet another definition given by Biengham, Bruce and Mooris is, “It is a conversation with a purpose and the purpose may be to get information, to give information and to make a friend.”
According to L.P. Alford and H.R. Beaty, “The employment interview is for the purpose of determining the suitability of the applicant for the job and of the job for the applicant. In simple words, interview is an attempt to secure maximum information from the candidate in a face to face dialogue. The interview gives an opportunity to judge the qualifications and characteristics of an applicant and provide the basis for selection.
The candidate becomes aware of essential facts about the job and the organisation-providing him an opportunity to decide whether to join or not. The process of interview cultivates goodwill towards the concern irrespective of the fact whether the candidate makes it to the last stage of selection or not. The interviewer may follow structure pattern similar to the application form.
The basic purpose of the interview is to identify behaviour patterns of the interviewee or candidate. Occurrence and reactions to situations that are repeated in the applicant’s experience suggest characteristics reaction pattern. Interview enables the interviewer to judge certain qualities like manners, appearance, ability to speak, grasp of things etc., of the candidate.
ADVERTISEMENTS:
The Interviewer Should Possess the Following Qualifications:
(a) He should have a complete knowledge of the job.
(b) His approach should be objective and he should think critically, systematically and analytically.
(c) He should have experience in conducting interviews.
(d) He should not be over talkative.
(e) He should have maturity and poise.
Objectives of Interview:
Some of the objectives of interview are discussed as follows:
1. Judgement of Applicant:
Interview gives an opportunity to the interviewer to know about the applicant. The information gathered from application- blank and tests is verified by talking to the candidate.
It provides a chance to know whether the information (about previous experience and training, etc.) supplied by the candidate is justified by him or not. The appearance, ability to communicate, attitude, nature, etc. of the applicant are also judged at the time of interview.
2. Give Information to The Applicant:
ADVERTISEMENTS:
Interview is undertaken not only to know about the applicant but also to use it as an opportunity to give him information about the company and the job. Applicant is given full information about the nature of job, hours of work, medical facilities, and opportunities for advancement, employee benefits and services, etc. Thus, the applicant can make a decision of joining or not joining the new job.
3. Promote Goodwill:
An interview also gives an opportunity to create and enhance goodwill of the company. The interviewee should be treated with curtsy. If not selected, then reasons for the same are explained offering constructive suggestions.
Interview Process:
Interview Process Consists of a Number of Steps. The Main Steps are discussed below:
1. Preparation for the Interview:
The advance preparation for interview is essential so as to decide about the vital aspects to be covered.
Following Preparation Is Essential:
(a) The type of interview to be conducted should be decided by taking into account the requirements and nature of job.
(b) Identify the knowledge and skill areas to be examined through interview.
(c) Decide the number of interviewers to be associated for the ‘interview’. The personal traits, technical competence, initiative, commonsense, ability to inspire confidence etc, of the interviewers should be taken into account.
The interviewers from personnel department, line managers, and specialists in the concerned area, academicians and psychologists should be preferred.
2. Coverage:
The coverage of the life history during the interview is designed to provide the information regarding (a) experience and education (b) gaps in employment history (c) academic achievements (d) likes and dislikes (e) information on health, financial and domestic problems (f) marital status (g) extra-curricular activities.
When The Candidate is answering Questions, the Interviewer Can Judge a Number of Traits Such as:
(i) Sense of humour
(ii) Mannerism
(iii) Quickness of reaction
(iv) Fluency of speech
(v) Ability to organise thoughts
(vi) Physical vigour
(vii) Appearance
(viii) Cultural Level
(ix) Shrewdness and sophistication
(x) Quick witticism
3. Conducting the Interview:
The purpose of the interview is to judge the knowledge and understanding of the candidate. Conducting of interview is a difficult task and there is a scope for committing mistakes during the process.
Interview should be opened with polite words and informal talks such as asking the candidate about his journey, difficulty in locating the office etc. It will create a sense of confidence in the candidate and he will feel easy.TROY, N.Y. — U.S. Senate Minority Leader Charles E. Schumer and U.S. Senator Kirsten Gillibrand on Friday announced $1,540,243 in federal funding for the Unity House of Troy. Funding was provided through grants from the U.S. Department of Justice’s (DOJ) Office on Violence Against Women, a news release said
The first grant will provide $750,000 from the Consolidated Youth and Engaging Men Program, which will be used to implement a comprehensive project to develop, expand, and strengthen coordinated community responses to sexual assault, domestic violence, dating violence, and stalking in Rensselaer County.
The second grant will provide $325,000 from the Training and Services to End Violence Against Women with Disabilities Grant Program, which will be used to provide services and develop resources for survivors of domestic violence or sexual assault who are in the Deaf or disabled community.
The third grant will provide $465,243 from the Transitional Housing Assistance Program, which will be used to provide housing and supportive services to survivors of domestic violence, sexual assault, dating, or stalking who are homeless or in need of permanent housing, the release said.
“Unity House is pleased and honored to receive this funding. Children, youth and young adult victims dealing with or exposed to sexual assault, domestic violence, dating violence, stalking or sex trafficking have been historically underserved. Lack of access to information and resources leaves victims trapped in abusive situations unaware of options and possibilities for a better future. This vital funding will afford Unity House and its community partners the ability to develop and implement coordinated comprehensive prevention and intervention services to help some of the most vulnerable in our communities,” Christopher Burke, CEO, Unity House of Troy, said in the release.OSA | ÉAO presents

Generally speaking, engagement in events is declining and attention spans are shrinking. So the question becomes, how do you address this to help your meetings & events remain highly impactful?
Audio, video, & lighting technology provides some of the most optimal methods of connecting & engaging with your audiences! Here are seven AV elements that can help you to captivate your audience and drive your content home!
A concert-level audio system is likely to surprise and delight your attendees. With high quality audio typically reserved for musical performances, your audience will appreciate being able to hear the spoken content with more ease, and any sound effects or musical transitions will be that much more powerful.
We’ve spoken about the benefits of dynamic video use in events before, but the effects cannot be understated. Using video elements like animated logos & backgrounds, video transitions, and IMAG (showing footage of the speakers up on the screens), you can keep your audience’s interest on the content being shared.
For more tips on using video in your events, check out Bringing Your Logo To Life and Seven Ways to Make the Most of Your LED Wall.
Lighting can make a huge difference in the ambience of an event, whether it’s focused on the stage or used throughout an event space. You can go simple with a wash and some uplighting, or get creative with some moving heads & coordinate some eye-catching cues with different speakers or themes. Adding fog or atmosphere to a space is another simple move that can give your lighting a more dramatic or concert-like look, allowing the beams to be seen through the space and extending the impact of the effects.
Polling is an easy way to get your audience involved in an event, especially if you can display the results & relate them back to the content being presented. There are many apps & clicker systems out there that you can use to achieve this, but one of our favorites is UMU. In addition to polling functionalities, UMU also makes it easy to do raffle drawings, games, and quizzes, and provides you with an engaging and aesthetically pleasing interface to use on-screen.
Now, we know that VR & AR are up-and-coming technologies that still carry a hefty price tag, so right now it’s about baby steps. Encourage vendors in exhibit booths to utilize VR! This has been very popular in many conferences, and although it may not specifically reference the content of the conference, the experience stands out to the attendees and elevates their overall experience.

Q&A’s are another great way to get your audience engaging with the content. Placing microphones throughout the audience not only encourages participation, but it also sends the signal early on that there will be a time for questions, which encourages attendees to pay more attention throughout the event.
Depending on how you use it, staging can be passive and minimally engaging, or you can take advantage of new technology and create a more dynamic set for your event. There are so many opportunities for dynamic & interactive staging these days, from responsive physical set pieces to LED walls that open up a world of possibilities when it comes to content & transitions.
To check out some examples of our staging design process, head over to our Portfolio page!
These are just a few examples of ways to bring impact & interactivity to an event, but depending on who your audience is, there may be many more options for you event! We’d love to help you come up with a creative solution to keep your attendees wowed and engaged!You gotta know when to be lazy. Done correctly, it's am art form that benefits everyone.

Eleven audio specialists from Saudi Arabia, Lebanon, the United Arab Emirates, and Egypt attended a Dynacord Academy in Dubai from July 7 to 9. The three-day workshop, devoted to the Dynacord Promatrix 4000, was based on a new training concept whereby not only the theoretical advantages of a modern approach to hardware and software design but also the practical application of the new technology explored. The Academy was held in Bosch’s Dubai offices and aimed to teach attendees to design their own systems on short notice, make them operational, and identify and correct any faults."The concept proved a total success," reported Nils Schächtele, product manager for Dynacord PI–ELA, who conducted the seminars. "In the course of three days, the participants made tremendous progress." The same principles were applied at Dynacord’s ProLive Academy in Straubing from July 20 to 22. The academy was designed to provide 11 German customers from the mobile audio sector and rental business an opportunity to broaden their experience and acquire a more profound understanding of the technology behind Dynacord systems like the Cobra and the VariLine. "We made the most efficient use possible of the available time," said Oliver Sahm, director of the Technical Support team, ProAudio EMEA. "The feedback from customers attending the academy was excellent – especially since the workshops dealt with, and provided solutions to, some of the core problems faced by rental companies in Germany today: how to comply with the increasingly strict regulations on sound emission levels and how to target low-frequency radiation through the use of cardioid bass setups."

Job Type: Part-timeMordecai throws 3 more TDs, SMU beats Tulane
D half in a 55-26 victory over Tulane on Thursday night.
The Mustangs (7-0, 3-0 American Athletic) are a victory away from their second 8-0 start in the past three seasons as they get ready to play three of the next four games on the road in a stretch that ends with a trip to No. 2 Cincinnati.
“You’ve got to go play well when you have the national stage,” Dykes said. “We don’t get it very often. I thought our guys were excited about the opportunity and took advantage of it certainly in the first half. Second half wasn’t as good.”
Mordecai had 300 of his career-high 427 yards at halftime, capped by a 22-yard toss to Reggie Roberson Jr. for a 31-7 lead 53 seconds before the break.
The Oklahoma transfer’s 3-yard scoring run on a bootleg off a fake pitch fooled the entire Tulane defense early.
.
Pratt exited the game midway through the fourth quarter after getting hit while sliding at the end of a scramble. SMU linebacker Gary Wiley was penalized for a late hit after a targeting call was overturned. Freshman Kai Horton took over and later threw an interception.
“I thought those guys played hard all the way through the game,” Dykes said. “That’s hard to do when those guys have been through what they’ve been through this year. I know it’s been a tough year for them.”
With lead running back Ulysses Bentley IV limited again by an ankle injury, SMU’s Tre Siggers had 81 yards rushing and two touchdowns, including a 1-yard score that was initially ruled short of the goal line but reversed on replay. Bentley had one early catch for 6 yards.
Danny Gray had eight catches for a career-high 140 yards, the biggest a 43-yarder on third-and-14 from the SMU 18-yard line with Tulane building momentum in the third quarter.
THE TAKEAWAY
Tulane: A spirited third quarter kept the game interesting. A fake field goal almost resulted in a touchdown that could have pulled the Green Wave within 10 points. Tulane recovered an onside kick late in the third when trailing by 19, but Pratt was stopped short on a fourth-down scramble near midfield on the first play of the fourth quarter.
SMU: Don’t sleep on the Mustangs’ kickoff return game if this unbeaten run continues. Bryan Massey averaged 42 yards on three returns, including a 58-yarder. Murray’s season average is at 52 yards on five returns, including a 95-yarder for a TD to help avoid an upset at Navy.
SMU KEEPS MOVING
Mordecai, who entered the game tied with Western Kentucky’s Bailey Zappe for the national lead at 26 TD passes, was 30 of 42 without an interception as the Mustangs finished with a season-high 612 yards total offense, 400 before halftime.
Grant Calcaterra, another Oklahoma transfer who helped Mordecai decide to come to SMU, had seven receptions for 90 yards. Fellow tight end Tommy McIntyre had a 24-yard scoring catch..
UP NEXT
Tulane: Another game against a ranked opponent as No. 2 Cincinnati visits the Green Wave on Oct. 30.
SMU: The first of back-to-back road games in Houston on Oct. 30. The Mustangs have won three of the past four against their former Southwest Conference rival, including twice when Houston was ranked.You’re such a devoted fan that the authenticity of your allegiance is never called into question.

TomatoesHere’s how we make this pizza. Three for Thursday: playing along with Cindy of My Corner of Katy.
What differentiates a bulb from a perennial plant is that the nourishment for the flower is stored within the bulb itself.…There is something miraculous about the way that a little grenade of dried up tissue can explode into a complete flower.
I love the look of your rustic looking pizza. Eating what you (or your gentleman farmer) has grown is so much part of the fun of summer.
Kathy, I’m so glad you played along! That tomato-pesto pizza looks absolutely delicious! I’m happy the Gentleman Gardener wasn’t disappointed by late blight this year.

Review by Charlotte Mincher
9 December 07
Rure is one of those typical (slightly cheesy) stories where the main character has a strange affinity with spirits, can see them, talk to them, etc while no one else can. Ha-ru is also the heiress to her family's fortune; a little heard-of island where she's worshipped as a princess. Meanwhile, her half-sister, Mi-ru is shunned by the family as an outcast, and is generally disliked by everyone except Ha-ru. But although Ha-ru tries to get along with her, Mi-ru dispises her, and, on a suitably stormy night and after a row with the family, Mi-ru runs away and falls from a cliff, Ha-ru chasing her and falling to the same fate. They end up in a strange world quite unlike their own, living in the desert with a band of mercenaries (Ha-ru having to hide the fact she's a girl).
But still… Much as the story seems to have been done and re-done a million times before, I'm a little curious to see how it all turns out. The main character is genuinely likeable, and the artwork is really nice. It isn't something that comes across as too childish, and there's enough humour there to prevent it becoming too boring and monotonous.
If you're looking for something new without too heavy a storyline, I definately recommend this one. I've generally found the first volume of most series' to be a little slow, and I plan on reading further - if the pace picks up, this could be a new favourite…Finance & Insurance217 N.

Are you concerned about running into problems with SEO for your Bay Area website if you make changes? Every now and then, a webmaster looks at his or her web site and decides it is time for a change. While change can certainly be a good thing – fresh content and a fresh look can add interest – it can also be a bad thing if SEO is not considered while redesigning the site. SEO problems can be avoided by paying attention to a few factors and being careful to use the tools available.
Web developers who know about SEO will first consider the SEO impact that changes can make. When a site is already ranking in a search engine, changing the URLs or deleting content that has been indexed can cause that ranking to take a serious hit.
If the URLs are changed, but the content remains similar or the same, the SEO hit can be mitigated by using a 301 redirect. This tells the search engines that the page still exists, just in a different location. This preserves the age and rank of the pages in question.
Knowing the site – its structure and content – will aid in succeeding as you change a site while preserving the SEO. Structure, URLs, and meta data are all important factors that provide tools to match up a redesign with the original site. There are tools such as Screaming Frog that simplify this process by gathering the information into one place, so it does not have to be done manually.
Some of the things that you will need to check to make sure everything is properly filled in and ready for the search engines include: no missing page titles, page titles that are all different, page titles between 200 and 512 pixels, H1 tags that are missing or duplicate, more than one H1 tag per page, meta data that is missing or duplicated, descriptions that are too long, canonical tags and links, broken links, and alt text for images.
Perhaps limiting titles by pixels is a new concept; most people consider characters rather than pixels. 512 pixels, less about 12 for ellipses if it goes over, translate into about 70 characters. More than this will result in the page title being truncated – sometimes resulting in a less than comprehensible title.
Also important are the sitemap, robots.txt, speed and performance of the site, and duplicate content. Checking these things can help you to know what is working well and what needs to be improved.
Broken links are always a red flag for SEO purposes, so it is wise to check those regularly, but especially when redesigning. It is important that both internal and external links are valid and resolve to a quality site. There are tools available to aid in testing both kinds of links on the site, as well. If there are broken links, or links that go to sites that are not considered to be ‘quality,’ you will want to fix these issues before making the changes to your website live.
If it is preferred, a company such as Bay Area Online Marketing can be hired to handle the redesign and preserve or improve the SEO on the site. Contact us for more information.User talk:MatthewClarke
G'day Matthew. Welcome. Thanks for your email. I think the technology pages you suggested are a great idea. I've set up a few templates for some of them which can be tweaked and renamed as we get a better idea of how it should be organized. Cheers, Graham

Bible verses
I'm going through Shortpages to revert vandalism. These are all are part of the vandalism that occurred. I've been able to revert everything on the page except the wikitable, no matter what I do I can't get anywhere with them, so I noted it in my edit summary hoping someone else can do something. --Kathleen.wright5 10:48, 26 November 2009 (PST)
Bible verses done plus page I can't revert
All the Bible pages with wikitable's incorrect (those that have been found so far) have now been corrected. I can't edit this page Colossae there are some strange symbols in the upper left hand corner and there are no tabs at the top of the page. --Kathleen.wright5 17:46, 26 November 2009 (PST)
- P.S The above only happens when I'm logged in, otherwise the page is OK. I'm using Firefox 3.5.5 as my web browser. --Kathleen.wright5 20:19, 26 November 2009 (PST)
- Whatever it is is still happening at my end, as I said I'm using Firefox 3.5.5 as my web browser, and there may still be more pages. --Kathleen.wright5 10:53, 27 November 2009 (PST)
- It's also happening with Internet Explorer 8, but with IE it says the website cannot display the page and that its an HTTP 500 Internal Server Error --Kathleen.wright5 11:02, 27 November 2009 (PST)
- The same thing has now happened to Epistle to the Colossians --Kathleen.wright5 11:47, 27 November 2009 (PST)
- I am also using Firefox 3.5.5 and see no trouble. I do, however, see lots of problems in IE 8. With Joshua 24, for instance, IE shows the main content fine but the navigation controls are misplaced way down the page. In IE, the Infobox_Contents doesn't appear on any page for me. Whose the most technical person we have in the team who can investigate? Matt 10:28, 28 November 2009 (PST)
- Yes, the same thing is happening with me with Joshua 24 and every page I've tried in IE 8. The most technical person round here is Prab Tumpati, his email address is [email protected] --Kathleen.wright5 16:31, 28 November 2009 (PST)
- I've found some more pages like Colossae and Epistle to the Colossians, all image files as follows: Image:Maps-divided-kingdom.gif, Image:Pleasanton Ridge.jpg, Image:Sunol Flag Hill and Valley.jpg, Image:Paul's Missionary Journeys Small.jpg and Image:Maps-near-east-abrahams-journey.gif --Kathleen.wright5 06:32, 3 December 2009 (PST)
Clean up
Hi Matt. I've just noticed a great point you put in the WikiChristian:Clean-up page (WikiChristian:Clean-up#Ambiguity about "Discussion" pages) and I've put my two cents in. I've also noticed that you asked a question about renaming the opinion articles with a new name-space. That's also a good idea. How do we go about doing it? I'm not very good with the technical side of mediawiki - do you know how to add name-spaces? --Graham 06:30, 20 April 2010 (UTC)

School of Science and Technology, SingaporeAll of the details of the Florida Legislation SB 550 and how it will affect home owners with septic systems is included in this report. Also included is what you need to know about the newly mandated inspection program.
Special Session Over the Budget a Possibility. Governor Crist is apparently entertaining the idea of calling a special session of the legislature. The time is NOW to make sure you contact the Governor’s office and make sure he knows how important BUDGET LINE ITEM 1775A is to more than 2.5 million residents of his state who have septic systems.
This Phase II Study funding represents an expenditure of less than $1.00 per affected citizen and has the potential to make sure billions of their hard-earned dollars are not wasted on un-tested, un-proven and possibly unnecessary electrically operated nitrogen reducing septic technologies (PBTS).
As an added benefit, the new passive alternatives included in this Phase II study may very well be an environmental game changer for septic systems installations throughout the country. We won’t know unless the funding is approved and the Phase II study completed. Preserve the funding for Phase II, Line Item 1775A, and it’s a win/win for the people of Florida and the environment. Even the EPA and the Florida Department of Environmental Protection win on this one – as Florida shows it’s serious about real science, real solutions and real cost/benefit.
SEND AN E-MAIL TO Charlie.Crist@eog.myflorida.com TODAY.
FROM THE DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH WEBSITE: A quick summary of the current status and description of the Phase II Study parameters. The Interim Report mentioned below is available on this website and through the DOH website.
Current Status:
Department of Health rulemaking for the Wekiva Study Area was put on hold by the Legislature until May 1, 2010.
February 2010 – Interim Report issued.
The department has issued an Interim Report on the Passive Nitrogen Reduction Study (678 kb pdf). The report recommends that the Legislature provide at least $2 million to fund the next phase of the project, primarily for field monitoring over at least a one-year monitoring period of performance and cost of technologies at home sites, and of nitrogen fate and transport. This funding also will continue the development and monitoring work at the test facility, and of modeling. Additional funding will be needed from the 2011 legislative session to complete monitoring and other field activities, and final reporting with recommendations on onsite sewage nitrogen reduction strategies for Florida’s future.
A PERSONAL, AND NOW PUBLIC, NOTE OF THANKS from Doug Everson
It wasn’t perfect and there are areas we’ll need to watch out for but……The passage of SB 550 is a testament to our system of Government . A few people can affect a change or course. For me, it represents the culmination of years of fighting and working to see that neither the small business people who comprise our industry, nor the homeowners who utilize our systems and services fall victim to well intentioned, but poorly crafted rules. It was a small Septic tank contractor with a strong accent (Dominique from Greens Environmental) and a Realtor/Broker and Property Manager from Orlando (Pam Tucker) who were the first to take up the cause with me. It is because of them and their staying the course these many years that common sense finally prevailed. To the Realtors, the Home Builders, the Markham Woods Homeowners Association, the Florida Onsite Wastewater Association, and all the other individuals who took up the cause and became involved over the years THANK YOU. There are many Legislators who understood and worked to make it happen for their constituents.. You will NOT be forgotten! Our task now is to see it is implemented fairly. With the funds to finish the critical Phase II research and testing on passive systems ,reasonable benefit/ cost options will be available.
Plastic Tubing Inc… and its owner Mike Maroschak , even during these tough economic times, you continued to support our efforts and the industry, my personal thanks for doing what was right .
Doug Everson
THE IMPACT OF THE RECENTLY PASSED SB 550 ON SEPTIC SYSTEMS IN THE STATE OF FLORIDA:
- Permits, Installations, and Repairs: Permit must be issued by the Dept. of Health for construction, repair, modification, abandonment, or operation of an on-site sewage system.
- Issuance of a permit not contingent upon prior approval by the Dept. of Environmental Protection (except certain coastal areas).
- Individuals may perform repairs and maintenance on his/her own residential system without a professional license, but is subject to all permitting requirements.
- DOH must approve and re-permit any septic where changes occur in occupancy or tenancy of a commercial building.
- Evaluation and Assessment: Beginning 1/1/11, DOH will administer a 5 year cycle of septic system evaluation assessing “the fundamental operational condition of systems and identifying any failures within the systems.” Assessment may include pump-out requirement, recommended repair, and possible enforcement procedures if owner does not obtain an evaluation. Owner is excused from evaluation if documentation is available showing that a pump-out or a permitted repair occurred within past five years.
- Separation of drain field from wettest season water table:
- Systems installed before 1/1/83 and still functional must meet the 6” separation.
- Systems installed before 1/1/83 requiring drainfield replacement, repair or modification must meet a 12” separation. This may require mounding to achieve the separation.
- Systems installed after 1/1/83 and still functional must meet a 12” separation
- Systems installed after 1/1/83 requiring drainfield replacement, repair, or modification must meet a 24” separation.
- Land application of septage will cease effective 1/1/2016. This may increase the homeowner’s cost to pump out a system as contractor fees for disposal will probably increase. A report will be generated evaluating the alternatives and costs prior to 2016.
- Fees for homeowner evaluation report paid to the DOH:
- Not less than $15, or more than $40. Plus whatever the contractor charges to do the report.
- Variance application – $150-$300
- Re-inspection site-visit fee after construction/modification – $25 – $100
The above bullet items are the only references contained in SB550 that are of immediate interest to our homeowners.
That said, the final version that passed the legislature was primarily about water supply and water resource planning. Stung as we were about the misinterpretation of the Wekiva Parkway Protection Act by the Department of Health, we read all of SB550 it to see if other areas of the bill were open to such interpretation or misinterpretation. Here is what we found:
- SB550 encourages the formation of Regional Water Supply Authorities which bring together counties, municipalities, water management districts, etc. with the goal of coordinating efforts to increase and sustain potable (drinkable)water for existing and future development. In the absence of Regional Authorities, water management districts increase the scope of their activity to function in the same manner.
Opinion Bullet #1. In the current total absence of economic growth in Florida, we fail to see the urgency of the problem. Basically, the bill increases the bureaucratic oversight and infrastructure. The costs of running such an authority are recoverable through increases in water and sewage fees. The fees and the provision for issuing bonds to fund water supply and water resource projects spells out a scenario for increased consumer costs. There is a provision that projected increases in supply or quality must be quantified.
- Water supply and water resource projects receive funding to increase the supply or the quality of available water. “Such efforts should use all practical means of obtaining water, including, but not limited to withdrawals of surface water and ground water, reuse, and desalinization.” Projects are given priority according to criteria including that the project “significantly implements reuse, storage, recharge, or conservation of water in a manner that contributes to the sustainability of regional water sources.” In another line item, we found projects receiving priority funding for flood control, water storage, and for “groundwater recharge augmentation.”
Opinion Bullet #2. Make no mistake; the output of septic systems recharges the aquifer. If septic system owners are increasingly being blamed for degradation of surface and groundwater, it would not be difficult for DOH or FDEP to justify a mandate that we take responsibility for making sure drinking quality water is the output from our systems into the groundwater/aquifer. The magic question is, how do they make sure it’s drinking water quality? The preliminary report from DOH suggests strongly that the only way they can assure water quality coming out of the aquifer at the springs is to control and easily test for nutrients going in – i.e. Performance Based Septic Systems (PBTS) are the only systems that can be easily tested for nutrients going into the ground water and aquifer at this time.
- Regarding the EPA’s proposed numeric nutrient standards, the bill strongly advises that the standards proposed by the EPA “fail to incorporate, and may undermine, the state’s science-based total maximum daily loads program.” Further, it states that imposed standards will have severe economic consequences on all segments of the state’s utilities, agriculture, industries and residents, specifically citing those on fixed incomes and living below poverty level.
Opinion Bullet #3. We are pleased the bill confronts the huge issue of harsh EPA standards being imposed on our state, and only in our state. And, we agree that these heavy handed mandates will cause economic hardship. However, both the EPA standards and the Total Maximum Daily Loads (TMDL) standards promoted by the Florida Department of Environmental Protection (FDEP), Basin Management Action Planning(BMAP) committees have been seriously questioned for their lack of science-based standards and conclusions about septic systems, and the billions it will cost to meet the targets set by both agencies, with little or no proof of appreciable improvements in water quality.
We are watching. We are waiting. We will see how this all plays out. If there are agendas, instead of fact, we will be involved. We know there are legislators who have been pro-active and driven to act on our behalf and on behalf of common sense. Thanks to all of those legislators who hold the concerns of our citizens dear and are the conscience of our state.Fe.

A plane crashed into a terminal building at an Australian airport Tuesday after the brakes on the jet failed.
According to 7News.com, a Cobham Aviation regional aircraft carrying around 60 passengers was taxiing to a terminal at Perth Airport Tuesday at about 2 p.m. local time when the plane’s brakes reportedly failed.

(NASDAQ:AAPL) has actually failed. While the new 19-pin Lightning connector has been a negative – something else we chronicled – the really big issue among those who have had the iPhone 5 in their hands has been the mapping feature, which may be a major problem, as the Maps feature from Google Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) was quite popular among iPhone users.
And apparently, Google Maps was more accurate and useful than this Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) replacement. And in the meantime? Google Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) has submitted its own standalone iOS 6 Maps app for approval in the Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) App Store.
Does anyone imagine that Apple will actually accept the app onto its iDevices? In a statement sent to a tech blog, Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) seems resolved to make its mapping app work, rather than giving in to Google: .”
Shouldn’t this have been tested in beta first? The disappointment over the mapping service has gotten pretty loud in online chatter, and it might be interesting to see in the coming weeks how that disappointment affects fervor over the iPhone 5 and how it might affect total sales will be something that investors like hedge-fund manager Julian Robertson of Tiger Management will likely note.You can make a smart Bluetooth based contactless thermometer by connecting the sensor with Bluetooth and getting the body temperature readings on an app. You can get the sensor data over the phone using a USB cable if you don’t wish to use Bluetooth.
This project basically has only two units: transmitter (IR thermometer sensor circuit) and receiver (mobile phone).
For making the Bluetooth based contactless IR thermometer, we need the components listed in the table above.
Coding
To write the Arduino code, install MLX90614 library in the Arduino IDE by selecting Adafruit MLX90614 Library from Sketch->Include Library->Manage Libraries option, and then add it in the code, as shown in Fig. 1. Next, create a setup function and set the baud rate for the Bluetooth module. Here, the default baud rate of Bluetooth is 9600. Create a loop function that runs again and again. Check the sensor readings and pass them to the serial.println() function (refer Fig. 2) so that when you connect the Bluetooth to the serial pin of Arduino, it transfers those readings to the Bluetooth module. You can also add an OLED display, but it is optional.
Connections
Next, make the connections as shown in Fig. 3. Make sure you connect power supply using a 9V PP3 battery. Positive wire of battery should connect to RAW pin and negative wire should connect to GND pin of Arduino Pro Mini. After this, make an app for Bluetooth communications through which you will get live readings on your phone.
Android app development
To make an app, you can use app creators such as MIT App Inventor, Kodular, Android studio, Eclipse, and others. For this project, Kodular has been used to create the app.
First, open Kudular on website using a valid email ID. Then, create a new app by clicking the ‘Create project’ option. Name the project as per your choice. Here, the project name is ‘Contactless IR thermometer.’ Next, make the app layout and add the following components to the layout:
- Bluetooth client
- File
- Listpicker
- Clock
- Image
There are three sections in the Kodular platform: Assets, Designer, and Blocks. The app layout in the Designer section is shown in Fig. 4. Open the Blocks section and start the coding by joining various blocks, as shown in Fig. 5. Next, export the project as IRThermo.apk file and install it on your Android phone.
Testing
After making the connections and installation of the app on your phone, enclose the hardware along with a 9V battery in a suitable plastic box with MLX90614 sensor fitted on the front panel. But first, you need to upload the Arduino code (IRThermo.ino) to the Arduino board.
Turn on the Bluetooth on your phone, open the app, and click on the ‘Tap to Connect’ button. Select HC-05 to connect it. After a successful connection, you can see the temperature readings on the app, as shown in Fig. 6.
Keep the IR temperature sensor near your forehead (about 5cm) and check the readings, which should be between 35°C and 37°C. The app can also save the temperature readings in a text file. You can check them in the file manager.
USB based contactless IR thermometer
You can also make the project by omitting the Bluetooth HC-05 module. With the same code in the Arduino board, connect the circuit with the phone using a USB cable and an OTG (on-the-go) connector, as shown in Fig. 7.
You need to install a serial monitor app such as Serial USB Terminal (by Kai Morich) on your phone. After connecting the circuit with the mobile phone, you can see the object and surrounding temperatures on the phone.

If you can replace arduino with some app working on smartphone then it’s turning your phone into a thermometer.
I books. We just had fiction books after our last library trip but I am planning to get some nonfiction books and then having one basket hold nonfiction books while the other hold fiction books or any other category to sort two types of books to get them to understand that library books are categorized at the library. After choosing their books, they scan their library card.
For the cards, I just used extra cards I had in my wallet. The scanner is just a flashlight stuck in the hole of a basket. Next, they have to scan the books. It’s cute to see them scan the cards and books because they make beeping noises like the scanner at the library.
I have a tissue box next to the “scanner” that has receipts in it so they take their receipt when done. They like to take their books to me and I pretend to be the librarian and we have story time. When they are done reading the books with me, they go back to the library and drop the books in the book return.
The kids totally love this play area and Sean wants it set up every day. I made him an Open and Closed sign and in the morning, he turns it to Open, sets up the library, and turn the flashlight on. I feel so lucky having such geeky kids.
This is awesome. I love it.
I love how creative you are! I’m sure your kids are super-smart. Any suggestions for a working mom? I know you were just as creative when you worked so maybe you have ideas for someone like me. I would love to stay home with Xander, I know it’s what’s best but we can’t afford it. I hope it doesn’t hurt him in any way. : (Marnie and I had a great night out at Nocturne in Halifax October 16, 2010.

Roughly, a go-to-market strategy is the answer to the question "how will you sell what you've made?" Roughly, but not quite.
When you start playing a new game, an expert can easily predict the mistakes you're about to make. It's easy for the expert to do because anyone who doesn't yet have an intuition for the game will make the same class of novice mistakes.
For example, in chess novices make blunders because they miss something trivial on the board. They'll often recognize the blunder immediately, even before their opponent makes the next move. In the game of Go novices attack stones by attaching to them even though attaching to an opponent's stone makes it stronger. And in business novices make a product nobody wants.
You can't transmit product intuition verbally any more than you can do that for chess. Improvement happens over time with considerable trial, error and repeated feedback. Still, some explanations are better than others, and all currently available explanations aren't good enough. We know that because perfectly smart, capable people will read everything available on the subject and still make products no one wants. Let's try to do better.
Imagine two startups-- A and B. Startup A has a great product and list of potential users that's longer than they know what to do with. They've hired an army of sales people and still barely scratched the surface of the list. Almost any time a salesperson calls up a potential user, the person on the other end is interested. They get what the product is about quickly. A third of the calls result in a second call, and almost all of those result in a sale. Users love the product. The office is vibrant and the energy is palpable. The company grows quickly. Life is good.
Startup B has a great product and technology that's years ahead. They have a list of potential users too-- from inbound emails, social media conversations, investor introductions, and their personal network. They can't quite tell if the product is a good fit for people on the list, but they have hunches. When they call, it's difficult to explain the product-- it takes a while for people to get it. Those who get it aren't quite sure if the product is for them. They ask about a few features. Maybe there is more back and forth. Ultimately, few people buy. In an attempt to get users, startup B builds features that pull it in different directions. After years of trying it runs out of money and shuts down.
Go-to-market
What's the difference between the two startups? Startup A has what the industry calls a well executed go to market strategy. Roughly, a go-to-market strategy is the answer to the question "how will you sell what you've made?" Roughly, but not quite. If you build the product and then try to answer this question, you'll find that it's nearly impossible. No matter how hard you try, the product doesn't sell. You become startup B. That's because there is a nuance in the question. The definition is almost correct but not quite. This one nuance probably killed more startups than almost anything else.
The problem is that the question implies sequential steps. First you make a product, then you figure out how to sell it. That's wrong. The product and the go to market strategy intricately depend on each other, the way two species may depend on each other in an ecology. Without one, there is no other. They must co-evolve together.
You might say "well, what about Facebook and Google? They didn't figure out how to make money until long after they've launched!" Fair enough. Replace "sell" with "get users". How will you get users for what you've made? That's still the wrong question. The making and the getting are one process-- they must co-evolve together.
There is an unpleasant corollary here. You can't apply this essay to an existing product that isn't selling. You can try and you may be able to salvage it, but you'll need to throw large pieces of your product out. You might need to throw all of it out. It's a difficult thing to hear, but that's what you've signed up for when you started a company.
Partition functions
At the heart of a go-to-market strategy is a user partition function. It works like this. Imagine you have a set
S with every person on the planet as its member. A partition function
user? takes members of this set as input and outputs a binary value--
true if the person is a target user of your product,
false otherwise. Another way to think about it is that
user? partitions the set
S into two-- a set of target users
U and a set of everyone else
E. For example your company, Linen Candy Corp., is building a new product for everyone who likes cotton candy. In that case your user partition function looks like this:
fn user?(person) {
return person.likes_cotton_candy == true;
}
This is easy enough. But there is more. The function must have two additional properties.
First, it must be precise. It doesn't have to be a computer program, though that wouldn't hurt. It could be specified in pseudo-code or in natural language. But if I point you to a person and give you the necessary information about them, you must be able to instantly tell whether they're a target user or not. No fuzziness. No maybe. No confusion. You must have complete and immediate certainty. Either
true or
false.
Second, the range of the function must be efficiently computable, and it must be efficiently computable by you. Imagine that your product is immensely successful. So successful that anyone in the set of target users
U who gets a cold email immediately buys it. Will you be able to efficiently generate a list of cotton candy lovers and their emails?
One way to think about it is that all functions that can be expressed using Facebook's ad targeting API are valid user partition functions because they satisfy both criteria. They're specific; and you can reach everyone in
U by paying Facebook.
Not all valid user partition functions can be expressed using Facebook's API. For example your product may be targeting everyone who's first name is Bill. That's not something Facebook ad targeting can do but you can find these users in a phone book. Or at least you could have back when we still had phone books.
To go back to the two startups, the concrete advantage of startup A is that it has a good user partition function. The target users understand and buy the product quickly because it was built just for them. The product solves their problems, and deliberately doesn't solve anyone else's. There is no confusion. The partition function unifies sales, marketing, and engineering. And it pulls everyone's work in exactly the same direction.
Scoring
Of course a function that splits users into two sets, is precise and is efficiently computable is a partition function, but that doesn't mean it's a good partition function. Most partition functions are bad, and a bad partition function won't give you startup A-- it will give you a more focused startup B that fails quicker. That's valuable in itself, but not good enough. So we need a way to measure the quality of partition functions.
Let's define a higher order function
score, which takes a partition function as an argument and returns and returns a number between
0 and
1. The score of zero means you won't sell anything. The score of one is the impossible platonic ideal-- it means you'll sell to every potential user you encounter. The higher the score, the closer you are to building the coveted startup A. Most partition functions have scores that hover around zero.
Here is one implementation of
score that's very simple. First, make a demo of the product as quickly as possible. The demo isn't the actual product, and it doesn't need to be a prototype. You can make it a Figma design or even a slide deck. All it has to do is communicate the problem and how your product solves it.
Then take a sample of potential users generated by your user partition function. About thirty would do. Call them all and try to get them to pay you. After a week, divide the number of potential users that sent you money over the sample size. That's your score. If you couldn't get anyone to pay you, the score is
0 / 30 = 0. If twenty people paid it's
20 / 30 = 0.66. If everyone paid it's
30 / 30 = 1.
There are many reasons this specific implementation may not work for what you're doing. You can tweak the sample size, the sales cycle length, or change the desired outcome from money in the bank to some other action or metric. Letters of intent, number of minutes spent per week on your site over a certain threshold, some minimum number of friends invited to the platform. You can adapt
score to any business, but be sure the outcome is meaningful! Money in the bank is best. There isn't a second best, but for complex business models a specialized metric can work too.
Focus
Think of early startup work in two stages. The first stage is generating many
(partition_function, demo) pairs and scoring them. Once you find a pair with a good score you enter the second stage. In the second stage you abandon everything else and completely focus on the one high scoring pair.
If you run into a potential customer who isn't in the current partition list, you don't work with them. If there is a feature that doesn't benefit users on the current partition list, you don't build it. When you design a landing page, you write only for the potential users on your list. They need to land on the page and answer the question "is this for me?" in one second, and then reaffirm the answer with every additional sentence. Discard anything that doesn't accomplish this goal, no matter how appealing it sounds.
What's a good score? It depends on your business. Here is one way to think about it: suppose a demo takes forty minutes, and between all the other work a sales rep (who early on is probably you) can only do five of these per day. A score of 0.2 means the rep will close one customer per day. A score of 0.1 means the rep will close one customer every two days. A score of 0.05 means the rep will close one customer in a week, give or take.
How do the economics work out? Does the product cost $500 or $50,000? Closing a $500 contract once per week is very demoralizing-- the sales reps can't even pay for themselves! Closing a $50,000 contract every week, now that's exciting! Which of the two offices would you rather work in? Look at the numbers, see if the math works out, then picture yourself working on a company with these numbers. Is it exciting? If it isn't, don't do it!
Sophistication
I've made a lot of simplifications here. That's deliberate. Early stage startups don't fail because they aren't sophisticated enough. They fail because they screw up the basics. For example, you can define a user partition function that returns a probability instead of a binary result. This is called lead scoring. It's useful when you've built a winning product for an audience and want to expand its reach. But until then it will blunt your focus and will do more harm than good.
It's important to learn about basic metrics for your space and look out for them as you're building. For example, The fundamental equation of SaaS. But before the product even exists, you must excel at the fundamentals. Don't use multiple categories when a binary decision will do. Don't use a continuum when you can get away with discrete categories. Simplify, simplify, simplify, and excel at the fundamentals. If you do, there will always be time for sophistication. If you don't, no amount of sophistication will help.

The planned investment for the shale ventures will be largely directed towards the Marcellus region in the US
The planned investment for the shale ventures will be largely directed towards the Marcellus region in the US
Mumbai: Reliance Industries Ltd, India’s biggest private sector company by revenue, plans to invest $2 billion (around ₹ 12,000 crore) in its three shale assets in the US, betting big on the potential of extracting natural gas and oil from the sedimentary rock formations.
Having already invested $7.3 billion since 2010 towards development of shale gas and oil in the booming US market, the company has now firmed up the new investments in the three joint ventures it has in the US, said two persons familiar with the plan.
The plan to step up RIL’s shale-gas investment comes at a time when the company is at loggerheads with the Indian government on the issue of increasing the price of natural gas produced from the company’s D6 block in the Krishna-Godavari (KG) basin.
The newly elected National Democratic Alliance (NDA) government has deferred until 30 September a decision on a proposed price hike pending modifications to a price formula suggested by the C. Rangarajan committee that would have nearly doubled the price of gas. Last month, it decided to join arbitration proceedings initiated by RIL and its partners seeking a price increase.
On 30 June, in its full-year earnings statement, Canadian company Niko Resources Ltd, which is a 10% partner in the D6 block, said the partners will defer their investment plans for the KG basin if the gas pricing issue is not resolved.
While these issues have deterred RIL’s domestic investment in exploration and production (E&P), the company has been steadily increasing its interests overseas with its bet on the shale oil and gas ventures, which have become a revenue generator for the company in a short span of three years.
According to the company’s June quarter results announcements, its shale gas operations posted a 26% increase in revenue to $270 million ( ₹ 1,620 crore) and 22% rise in operating profit to $201 million ( ₹ 1,206 crore) from the year-ago period.
Its share of production from the shale business too stood at 15 million metric standard cubic meters per day (mmscm) of gas, higher than its production of 8 mmsc of gas daily from the D1 and D3 fields of the D6 block in the KG basin.
“RIL’s share of US shale production increased to 15 mmscmd, 178% of its share of KG D6 production. Also, shale gas Ebitda (earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization) of $201 million for RIL in 1Q was 126% of that from domestic E&P," said a note by Deutsche Bank AG analysts Harshad Katkar and Amit Murarka on 20 July.
On 19 July, Alok Agarwal, chief financial officer of RIL, said after the announcement of its latest financial results that the company expects to post 20% growth in revenue, profit as well as production in this business.
One of the two persons cited above said the $2 billion of additional capex planned for the shale ventures will be largely directed towards the Marcellus region in the eastern part of the US where the company has agreements with Chevron, and Carrizo Oil and Gas Inc.
Most likely, the investment will flow into the Chevron shale acreage, the person said.
In 2010, RIL ventured into the fledgling shale gas business in the US through joint venture agreements with three companies—Atlas Energy Inc., (now owned by Chevron) and Carrizo Oil and Gas Inc., in the prolific Marcellus region in south-western Pennsylvania and with Pioneer Natural Resources Co. (PNRC) in the Eagle Ford shale acreage, in the Texas region of the US.
It had invested a total of $2.046 billion in acquiring the stakes, giving it access to 12 trillion cubic feet of reserves.
“In the JVs with Pioneer and Carrizo, the business has already turned profitable and cash flows from the business are enough to fund the incremental capex there. Therefore, the new capex is meant for the stake with Chevron," the second person said.
The ramp-up of production in the Chevron JV is still very slow while the prospects are high. It is the Marcellus reserves the company is banking on, he added.
A mail sent to Chevron and RIL on 7 August remained unanswered till press time.
Ashish Jagnani, an analyst with UBS, said in a 21 July note that in the future the Chevron JV will account for a large part of the capital expenditure for RIL. Jagnani said RIL’s shale JV production was expected to rise at a compounded annual growth rate of 21% between fiscal 2014 and fiscal 2018.
Dhaval Joshi, analyst with brokerage Emkay Global Financial Services Ltd, said that a substantial part of the investment also depends on the Henry Hub prices, the benchmark natural gas price for the US market.
“Since the life span of a shale well is for a period of two to three years, companies always take a call on investment based on the estimated trend of Henry Hub. Anything above $4 per mmBtu makes good sense to invest heavily," he said.
According to Bloomberg, the current Henry Hub prices are at $3.9 per million metric British thermal units (mmBtu) and analysts say the outlook for the price is tepid for the next one year.Custom Crystal Cotton Canvas Tote Bag with Polka Dot Letter

First Minister Mark Drakeford has now given some more details saying the way people live has changed since the school year was devised in the 19th Century.
"It means moving the pattern of education from the 19th Century when Wales was primarily an agricultural nation to the 21st Century," Mr Drakeford told BBC Wales Live.
"The way we live our lives now, the way people are employed and the way parents have to manage the competing demands of life, means we need to revisit that fundamental thing about how the school year and the school day is organised in Wales,
"It's a radical policy shift. We would be the first part of the UK to do it. I'm very glad that we can now move ahead confidently because of our agreement to tackle that very important issue."
Read more: What we know about the Welsh Government's plans to offer free school meals and childcare for two year-olds and when it will happen
The Labour/Plaid deal commits to: "Aim to reform school termdates to bring them more in line with patterns of family life and employment. We will also explore options to reform the rhythm of the school day to create space for more wide-ranging, culturally accessible activities and opportunities."
Changing school term dates and school hours has significant cost and time implications, trade unions representing teachers said earlier this week when the plans were unveiled.
“In terms of school day reform, which is arguably much more complex than changing the terms, pay and conditions, wrap around services like after school clubs, school transport, catering etc would all be thrown into the mix but crucially there needs to be some evidence to go down this route and as yet we’ve not seen any,” said Laura Doel, Director of the National Association of Headteachers Cymru told WalesOnline after the proposals were announced earlier this week.
Eithne Hughes, Director of the Association of School and College Leaders Cymru shared these concerns.
She said plans to reform the school year and day were “vague and sketchy” and called for more detail. “Is it about extending contractual hours and will it effect conditions of service for teachers?
“They are going to reform term dates , that was in Labour’s manifesto and now this co-operation agreement. Welsh Government needs to do this through the correct process. That could take years.”

Labour and Plaid Cymru are going to look at reform of the school year and changing the "rhythm" of the school day, as part of their extended three year co-operation deal in the Senedd.
As part of its deal announced on Monday for a co-operation agreement with Plaid Cymru, Welsh Government has also promised free school meals for all primary school pupils, free childcare for all two year olds.
Some experts say disadvantaged children would benefit from the changes to the school day and year. The debate has been looked at for years with some research saying children forget what they have learned over the six week summer break and get out of the habit of learning.

They got the funny.
So who goes into battle with Deadpool this time around? We are not 100% sure who will actually be doing the battling, but so far, we've confirmed we'll see Colossus, Domino, Cable and Negasonic Teenage Warhead.
With some skillful slamming of the pause button, we can confirm the awesome and enigmatic Terry Crews is playing Jesse Aaronson AKA Bedlam, who can create, effect and project bio-electric fields. This means he can mess with machines from a distance, knock someone on their butt or toy with the delicate energies that keep our bodies working...and our minds sane! He's also specially trained to kick all sorts of ass.
Our next mystery is the purple haired Asian girl you saw in the Negasonic pic up above. We are betting this is Noriko Ashida AKA Surge (the electricity was a tip off..and the hair). Surge can absorb electricity from everything around her and discharge it. This also allows her to move with super human bursts of speed.
Then we've got the two flanking DP as he exits the plane! Some time back, eagle eyed fans pointed out the guy in the headgear is most likely Gaveedra Seven AKA Shatterstar, who possesses a host of powers like enhanced speed, strength and senses, that make him an exceptional warrior.
The second body, to DP's rt, is a bit of a head-scratcher. Industry vet and mega geek extraordinaire Jon Schnepp has theorized the yellow face mask marks this as Axel Cluney AKA Zeitgeist, possessing the unique power to vomit out "energized ooze" from his mouth. Hey...if you are building a team partially for unexpected laughs, he's the way to go! Oddly, the character is played by Bill Skarsgård, who is not even listed in the cast on IMDB.
With a promise the recent reshoots added even more cameos designed to push mega-fans over the edge, this movie is quickly becoming the one to watch for news, reveals, and easter eggs in those trailers!

Zoom Meeting October 17th at 2:00pm
Our Speaker will be Angela Pullen-Smith
When my husband and I bought our house in 2013, it was an ordinary city plot, surrounded only by lawn and a couple overgrown trees. However, the blank canvas was very motivating. I’ve spent the last 8 years removing sod, planting more interesting things, and adding new features such as stone work and a pond. I liked the feeling of enclosing my home in a little forest, a sanctuary in the suburbs. I’ve always been inspired by the beautiful old gardens in Kyoto, as well as the mossy Alaskan forests- places with a feeling of mystery and calmness. When planting new areas of the garden, I tried to keep in mind the entire ecosystem- what will be shaded, what will live under, where the little patches of sun will peek through, so that it will work together as a whole.
Sure, I was born and raised here- grew up on 40 acres of forest, but went to college in Washington. Though I haven’t been to Japan yet, I love visiting Japanese gardens in cities I travel to..Each year, around 700 people are killed in their place of employment. Between 1992 and 2012, there were 14,770 reported incidences of workplace violence – all of these involving victims of homicide. These frightening statistics are a stark reminder that workplace violence is a real possibility and has the potential for extreme tragedy.
Though many cases of workplace violence have led to fatalities, nonfatal cases are even more common. Hundreds of thousands of nonfatal violent crimes have been committed in a variety of workplaces. In fact, it is estimated that about two million cases of workplace violence occur every year, ranging from verbal or physical abuse to murder.
Workplace violence can be prevented by learning to identify the signs of a potential threat and taking measures to keep your workplace a safe, nonviolent environment. Establishing clear policies, supporting your employees, and engaging in ongoing training can all help prevent violent incidents in your workplace.
What Is Workplace Violence?
Workplace violence is any threatening or disruptive behavior (including physical violence, harassment, and intimidation) that occurs at a work site. Even the mere threat to commit one of these acts qualifies as workplace violence. Employees, clients, and customers can all be potential perpetrators or victims of violence.
Unfortunately, many incidences of workplace violence go unreported every year. This can be attributed to fear of backlash, such as being suspended or terminated. Other times, victims may not even realize that they what they are experiencing is classifiable as workplace violence. Research has identified certain factors that may increase the risk of violence in the workplace. Some of these factors include:
- Worksites where employees exchange money with the public
- Hostile or unstable people in the workplace (employees or customers)
- Working alone or in an isolated manner
- Providing services that involve personal care for others
- Working where alcohol is served
- Working late at night
- Working in areas with high crime rates
High-risk professional fields include delivery driving, public service, customer service, healthcare, and law enforcement.
Economic Costs of Workplace Violence:
- Productivity loss
- Staff replacement (turnover)
- Loss of management expenses and time
- Loss of company assets
- Negative public perception of the company or organization
Workplace Violence Prevention strategies:
- Establish a policy before an incident occurs. Create a policy that involves every level of the organization: employees, managers, and executives. Ensure that everyone is aware of the policy and are updated as the policy changes. A copy of the workplace violence policy should be distributed company-wide, and upper management should be responsible for making sure every employee understands it. As part of the policy, there should be a clear system for handling and resolving complaints in an expeditious and private manner.
- Maintain open lines of communication. Communication is a key strategy for preventing workplace violence. Perpetrators of violence feed on silence from victims and witnesses. Employees should be encouraged to communicate regularly in team meetings or one-on-one meetings with superiors. These meetings can help diffuse anger and clear up misunderstandings, decreasing the chances of a violent outburst.
- Workplace violence prevention training. Take the time to provide proper and thorough training to promote awareness of workplace violence. Ensure that employees are aware of the signs of violence and how to respond in a dangerous situation at work. Emergency plans should be created and reviewed annually to keep everyone in the company ready to respond to a violent incident, if necessary.
- Establish and enforce a zero-tolerance policy. There should be no leeway for perpetrators of workplace violence. Even if it’s only a verbal threat, management cannot allow these incidents to be swept under the rug. This creates a dangerous precedent that your company is lenient on violence or underprepared for a serious incident. Be sure that all employees are aware of the company code of conduct. This will show that your company is committed to keeping employees and customers safe from harm.
- Talk about diversity. Through open, respectful communication and proper diversity training, you can help your team understand that differences between each member are a strength and an advantage. Team-building activities can help employees get to know each other and become more accepting of diversity in the workplace. Hostility towards a particular group of people is a risk factor for violence in the workplace and the world.
- Intervene in conflicts before they escalate. In any workplace, there will inevitably be conflict or power struggle. Upper-level management should take responsibility for monitoring employees and observing how they work together. If tensions are not relieved, they can fester and escalate into harassment or violence. As soon as you see a conflict developing, take steps to provide resolution. Conflict resolution training is very helpful for learning how to diffuse situations in ways that satisfy all involved parties.
- Take steps to help employees build quality relationships. Encourage each person to be open-minded. Let your employees know that each one of them plays an important role in the organization and that their work is appreciated. Show respect and fairness to every employee and encourage this behavior throughout the organization. Feeling that their contributions are meaningless or that they are not valued is a risk factor for employee violence.
- Encourage reporting of unsafe behaviors. Any behavior that is disruptive or makes someone feel uncomfortable should be reported. Employees should feel that they have a safe space to report any questionable behavior in their co-workers. Confidentiality is crucial to employee comfort. Employees should not fear retaliation. By providing employees with a safe reporting outlet, suspicious or harassing behavior can be caught early – before it escalates to a violent incident.
- Handle company assets appropriately. Robbery is often a motivating factor for workplace violence. Keep the number of assets stored at the worksite to a minimum. Using electronic payment systems is one way to reduce the number of assets available for theft. A locked drop safe is also good for discouraging violence by robbery.
- Discourage bullying culture. Workplaces are often a place where social jousting and attack humor are used to entertain and pass the time. Discourage employees from using deprecating humor and from “poking fun” at co-workers. Though some people enjoy these types of jokes, it sends a larger message that the workplace is a place where bullying and harassment are tolerated. Reducing negativity and stress in the workplace should be a top priority. If the workplace becomes an environment that employees fear or despise, retaliation and violence become much more likely to occur.Fiverr and Upwork are becoming some of the most popular ways to make money on the web.

Because you can’t physically check. our AGM on 20 October, PLSA members voted for the new Articles of Association I wrote about in the previous issue of Viewpoint. That means our old rules, originally written in 1973, have been replaced by something much more modern and flexible – and it means we can make further changes to our governance to bring it into line with the world our members work in today.
In October we published a consultation on two changes to our governance structure: a new Policy Board and a new composition for the Board of the PLSA.
Our DC and DB Councils have been in place for five years and over that time we’ve seen an increase in the amount of policy work that cuts across both of them, as well as our Master Trust Committee.
Where one piece of work needs input from two or more policy bodies, there is duplication of effort from our policy team in drafting, presenting and amending papers. There is also the potential for conflicts to arise.
A new single body, responsible for strategic oversight of all our policy work, would make it easier to determine what we should focus on, ensure we can arrive at policy positions that work for all of our members more quickly than we can now, and be less bureaucratic.
We’ve also looked at the election system currently used by Councils for up to nine of their 15 members. Elections are open and democratic, but a relatively small proportion of our members put themselves forward or vote. We think a new selection process, where members apply for Policy Board roles, would attract a more diverse range of and skills to our policy work. It’s also in line with trustee appointments among our members.
All but one of our nine non- executive Board members are current or former Council members. Until now, people who wanted to become Chairs or Vice Chairs of Councils had no choice but to join the Board. This increases their commitment (and their employer’s) to the PLSA. It also means that the body with responsibility for the PLSA’s strategy and operations draws primarily on policy skills. Dependency on the Councils has meant the Board can be unstable too, with the potential for seven non-executive members, including the Chair, to change every two years.
While it’s right that PLSA members are on the Board and making sure we do our job well, Board membership requires different skills to Councils – and more stability at Board level would help us to implement strategy more effectively.
We propose to make the minimum number of non-executive directors ve (instead of six). Three of these would be PLSA members, including the Chair of the new Policy Board. The other two would be independent. The Board would be responsible for its own appointments – more in line with corporate practice.
These proposals are explained in more detail in a consultation document you can find here. We’re asking for your views on our ideas and whether you’ve got alternative models that could meet our goals. Although we’ve focussed on these solutions, we have considered others and recognise there may be more.
The consultation closes on Friday 5 January. If members support the new structure, we’ll use the first nine months of 2018 to make the transition, before implementing the changes fully at the next AGM on 21 October 2018.Numpty Dumpty – can new technology put the UK together again?
The UK’s data economy grew at double the rate of the national economy over the last decade, according to Steven Almond, Director of Technology and Innovation at the Information Commissioner’s Office (ICO). That’s good news, though the economic story of the last ten years was one of a fragile recovery between two calamitous falls: 2008-09’s 4.1% decline, and 2020’s 9.8% collapse.
Chairing a recent Westminster eForum on capitalising on emerging technologies, Almond said:
Realizing the enormous growth potential [of the digital economy] is going to rely on trust in technology, and trust in innovative business models, in new ways of doing things. […] So how can we create that trust in new technology? At the ICO, that’s something that we think about very carefully: supporting innovators in the data economy in testing and trialling new ideas through our sandbox.
It’s a worthy initiative. And there’s more good news, said Almond: from 2018 to 2022, the global volume of data is predicted to double, then double again by 2025, so capitalizing on its economic potential is key to the nation’s future prosperity. Part of that process will be smart regulation, the focus of the first conference session.
Capitalizing on data’s potential is one reason for the government’s stated desire to give the ICO a more commercial, enabling remit than its core role to date of protecting the citizen. However, this is a policy that appears to signal the beginnings of a planned shift away from GDPR, which would seem to be at odds with any plan to engender public trust. Wasn’t GDPR designed to protect us from Big Tech?
So, is Britain going to throw caution to the wind by deregulating to let business capitalize on the digital world, and focus less on protecting citizens’ data? If so, then it urgently needs competent adults in the room, because Britain’s critical data adequacy agreement with the EU risks being sacrificed alongside the Northern Ireland protocol, freedom of movement, research alliances, supply chains, and other casualties of No 10’s lack of strategic forethought.
Does Downing Street no longer see regulation as an enabler for trade on mutually agreed terms, but as an obstacle to it? Does the Prime Minister even understand the issues, given that the UK supposedly left the EU to escape red tape yet has been drowning in it ever since?
In this context, the eForum set out how the UK aims to capitalize on new technology and booming data, in the wake of Chancellor Rishi Sunak’s Spending Review. While investing modestly in the future, Sunak rowed back on some timescales for supporting the digital economy.
Nudge nudge, wink wink
Keynote speaker was Simon Parnall, Programme Director of Broadcast, Media, and Gaming Technology at Ofcom. The communications regulator has found itself in a Westminster whirlwind of late, as debate rages about who should chair it. Former Mail supremo Paul Dacre could be said to embody the binary world, but only by being on, off, on, then off again as No 10’s preferred candidate.
Parnall, who is also a Conservative councillor in leafy Surrey (presumably in his spare time), said:
It’s not just businesses that need to evolve and adapt; we as regulators do, too. We’re having to look very carefully at how we work and, in particular, how we can work at a pace that keeps up with how our stakeholders are evolving. Now more than ever, it’s important for us to work across disciplines, ensuring that our technologists are working closely with our economists, our strategists, and of course, our policy colleagues.
An important part of this is ensuring that we do not inadvertently impede the pace of innovation, that our policies and regulations are appropriately robust in the face of technology change. But increasingly we have a role in regulating for innovation. That is enabling and encouraging innovation, to the benefit of the citizens and consumers – those two magic words.
But in this area in particular, our role is more about soft regulation; it’s enabling, encouraging, and – this is my favourite word – nudging; showing people the way and encouraging them to change. But to date, we’ve had quite an inward-focused view of innovation.
The message that this government sees regulators’ role as nudging the UK towards preferred conclusions that benefit business is clear as it seeks to usher these organisations deeper beneath ministerial coat tails.
This has long been a tension in the role of regulators: on the one hand, they are a tool for monitoring the enforcement of policy objectives, but on the other they are supposedly independent bodies with a remit of protecting the consumer. Arguably, GDPR sought to balance those competing priorities in law, but this administration isn’t a fan.
A day at kindergarten
So how does Ofcom now see different elements of digital regulation interacting – privacy, competition, online safety, and other areas? And how does it view the digital regulatory landscape? In short, how might a more cohesive, joined-up approach benefit the UK? Parnall said:
That’s a really good question. One of the key things that we really, really need to do now is build much stronger links between our technologists and other colleagues who work in the organization, particularly policymakers and economists, because this helps us understand how these pieces fit together.
But then things turned bizarre. He continued:
I have a particular passion for Humpty Dumpty. Humpty Dumpty, as you know, in Alice in Wonderland – actually I think it’s Through the Looking Glass – said, ‘When I use a word, it means whatever I want it to mean’. And when we use a word very much, such as ‘algorithms’, it means different things to different regulators, because it has different applicability.
So, one of the things that we’re trying to do is to make sure, as we group together [sic], that we understand the common themes, and we also understand our diversity. That we can actually build upon that effectively to get a more comprehensive picture of how all these pieces fit together.
A passion for Humpty Dumpty? Leaving aside the vexed issue of words meaning whatever a policymaker wants them to (we’ve had enough of that in the UK), not to mention regulators grouping together, someone urgently needs to explain to policy spokespeople that the urge to use childish metaphors doesn’t play well with grown-ups.
From Boris Johnson’s fondness for Kermit the Frog downwards, it fails to instil the sense of nostalgia, comfort, and stability they think it does. It just makes everyone feel that it’s the last day of term at a private kindergarten, but there’s no one left to pick up the infants.
But if you are going to invoke childhood characters in a public speech, at least ensure that they don’t represent plucky incompetence (as Kermit does) or that the one thing we know about them is that they had a great fall, and no one could put them together again (Humpty Dumpty). In Brexit Britain, these aren’t the metaphors we need. What next, Chitty Chitty Bang Bang’s Child Catcher as a model for safety online? Pinocchio as a paragon of honesty in public office?
So, what does Parnall believe will be the major transformative technology for the UK, the one that will enable it to seize the glittering prize of digital success, rather than be left hugging the consolation teddy bear? He said:
I’m going to go for 5G, because one of the things we’re looking at is climate change. And we also appreciate that technologies offer new, enabling opportunities for other sectors. For example, in power generation, the communications that optimise the use of the network are terribly important to load shedding [protecting the power grid from blackout], and so on.
And [5G is also critical for] farming, with the advent of mobile communications at field level, while the capacity to deliver real-time video communications allows drones to manage farming processes. 5G is going to play an enormously important role in all of this.
OK, but there’s the small matter of the UK’s supply chain challenges, which Parnall acknowledged in his presentation. Not all of these are down to the perfect storm of Brexit and pandemic disruption; some are a hangover from other political manoeuvres, such as trade hostilities with China. And 5G is at the centre of these. He said:
The government’s decision to limit certain companies’ involvement in telecoms networks [a reference to Huawei] has led to further work to increase and diversify the supply of network equipment. UK operators have limited choice when selecting equipment suppliers to create the wireless portion of their mobile networks, known as the radio access network or RAN.
Let’s not beat around the bush: on announcing the 2020 directive to ban Huawei equipment from the UK’s 5G networks by 2027, the then Digital Minister Oliver Dowden told Parliament that the move would mean “a cumulative delay to 5G rollout of two to three years and costs of up to £2 billion pounds [$2.69 billion]”. How’s that for capitalizing on digital opportunity!
Parnall continued:
The government has published a plan to diversify global telecoms market supply to support incumbent suppliers, to attract new suppliers into the UK market, and to accelerate open interface solutions and deployment. And we’re working with government, industry, and other stakeholders to improve diversity and encourage the development of open and interoperable ecosystems.
The SONIC (Smart Open Network Interoperability Centre) Labs, based in London and broadband not-spot Brighton*, are part of the government’s strategy, a Whitehall-funded programme between the Digital Catapult and Ofcom, overseen by DCMS. It aims to create a commercially neutral environment to evaluate a range of open, software-centric networking technologies. These will play a leading role in finding solutions to the UK’s supply chain challenges, said Parnall.
Let’s hope SONIC wasn’t modelled on the hedgehog. But who can say anymore?
My take
Welcome to the UK: a nursery for new ideas, innovations, and science and technology superpowers? Or a room full of infants throwing toys out of prams? With this administration it is increasingly hard to tell.
*: Most of the city seafront between Brighton and Hove lacks fibre/cable broadband and relies on ageing copper connections, as our writer can attest firsthand.Menu Image CSS Css3Menu.com
NEW YORK CITY—Firehouse Productions recently deployed a complete HARMAN Professional Solutions audio system at the 60th Annual GRAMMY Awards ceremony at Madison Square Garden.
Held on January 28, 2018, this year marked the first time the ceremony was held outside of Los Angeles since 2003. Firehouse Productions was hired to provide sound reinforcement for the event, which included live performances by Kendrick Lamar, Lady Gaga, Kesha, Bruno Mars and Cardi B, SZA, Childish Gambino and more. In order to ensure exceptional sound quality for both the audience at Madison Square Garden and the television broadcast, Firehouse designed a complete HARMAN Professional audio system centered upon JBL VTX Series loudspeakers and Crown amplification.
“When it comes to sound quality at the GRAMMY Awards ceremony, we have incredibly high standards,” said Michael Abbott, Audio Coordinator, 2018 GRAMMY Awards. “The HARMAN VTX system delivered incredible results, and in my opinion Madison Square Garden has never sounded better. It was one of the best-sounding shows we’ve ever produced.”
Firehouse Productions Vice President Mark Dittmar and Systems Tech Jamie Pollock began working on the design three months before the ceremony, which involved coordinating with the art and lighting departments to optimize the system configuration for the elaborate stage and lighting designs. Another primary goal was ensuring that the energy of the system stayed extremely focused to avoid any roomy or washed-out sounds for the TV broadcast.
Intelligibility and transparency were also key, since the system volume needed to remain consistent throughout the dynamic range of performances. Using a combination of VTX V25-II loudspeakers and the new VTX A12 loudspeakers for the main arrays, the Firehouse team created a system that delivered incredible clarity and precision, even at the lower volumes required for the television broadcast.
“The National Academy of Recording Arts and Sciences takes this show very seriously, and front-of-house sound is a top priority,” said Ron Reaves, Front of House Music Mixer, 2018 GRAMMY Awards. “The JBL VTX system was one of the best PA systems I’ve ever mixed on, it just translated so well to the room. I can't say enough about the design and tuning of the VTX rig, because it was spectacular. The audience is made up of producers, engineers, and the world’s biggest artists—people who make their living listening critically to music. A lot of those same people came back and commented about how good the system sounded, more than I can ever remember. It was a huge win for Firehouse and JBL Professional.”
The HARMAN Professional audio system included two main hangs of 16 VTX V25-II loudspeakers per side, 14 VTX A12 loudspeakers per side, and nine VTX S28 subwoofers per side flown in a cardioid configuration. In addition, ten VTX G28 subwoofers were deployed in five ground stacks, 24 VTX V20 loudspeakers were deployed in six delay clusters, and 36 VT4886 loudspeakers were used for front fills. The entire system was powered by Crown I-Tech 1200HD and 4x3500HD power amplifiers in custom-built Firehouse racks.
“I've been designing PA systems for television shows for 18 years and this is probably the most successful design we've ever had,” said Dittmar. “The A12 loudspeakers performed great, and I'm a huge fan of the V25-IIs. We always go for an incredibly high level of intelligibility, but this pushed it to a level we've never heard before. It was a great-sounding show and it had impact, but it was several dB quieter than anything I've experienced in a long time. There was no need for it to be any louder because you could hear every S and every T, the diction was absolutely flawless. It was a perfect storm of things coming together to create an awesome experience.”Everyday jewelry with a

So. Tomorrow is my last day at work. It's been a year already. Can you believe it? I spent half of the day being pretty zen about it, and the other half moping around and being sad.
I then have 1 (one) week off, in which I will go see my parents. Then I go to uni. Again. For the second time. I have mixed feelings about being a student again. I've just spent hours reading all about enrolling and everything. I'm partly excited, and partly really missing the last time I was a student. I've suddenly realised that I have a horrendous loyalty to my old uni, and feel like I'll be somehow doing it an injustice by enjoying my time at a new university. Which is complete nonsense, of course.
But, I had sooooooo much fun when I was a student before, and met sooooooooo many nice people. And how on Earth can I ever hope to repeat that? (But seeing as I'm going to be a postgrad this time, I'm assuming that it'll be less fun by default anyway.)
And I just checked my timetable for our induction week. I thought it was going to be plain sailing in the first week, with very little to do. But I find out that busy timetable is BUSY. Seriously, I'm not going to have a chance to sit down. And I thought being a student was all about having lots of free time, and jaffing on the internet all day (at least, that's what I remember doing). Oh well, I'D BETTER MAKE THE MOST OF MY WEEK OFF THEN.
I've got lots of cartoons to watch next week. I've just downloaded a load of Loveless to read too. Mostly this week I've been watching nothing but Toward the Terra.
Toward the Terra is great (if it was a little dull in the middle). Surprisingly, I think my favourite character might be Keith, despite him being a complete bastard. I'm just. I'm really hoping that he's going to atone for everything at the end, and come to see that he's been wrong all along. And his relationship with Matsuka is interesting because it's just so contradictory. Personally, I think that the fact that Matsuka reminds him of Shiroe is no small factor in this. Also, Matsuka has pretty eyes.

The 100-year-old Carlton Tavern in Maida Vale was knocked down by developers CTLX, who wanted to replace it with flats, in 2015.
But they were ordered to rebuild the North West London pub back to exactly how it looked before by Westminster City Council.
It was uncovered that the developers had been refused planning permission to destroy the building.
This was because the property was Grade II-listed status by English Heritage - it was considered to be of historical importance after surviving the Blitz.
Demolishing a listed building without consent is a criminal offence and can result in a prison sentence and large fine, as well as other costs.
In this instance, CTLX were given two years to rebuild the Carlton Tavern ‘brick by brick’.
Now the rebuild is finished and lockdown restrictions have eased to allow indoor hospitality, landlord Tom Rees was able to welcome customers inside for a drink for the first time yesterday (Monday, May 17)..
Tom, 34, said: “We had a really lovely visit from Jimmy who’s one of our regulars, he’s 94, and his friend John, absolutely loving sitting in the warm.
“He’s really happy that we’ve brought the pub back and he just loves being back here.”
Tom and his business partner, Ben Martin, both formed their new company, Homegrown Pubs, together during lockdown.
The Carlton is their first pub although they have their eye on obtaining more.
“It’s been a huge effort,” Tom said.
“It was a real shame when it got knocked down, but what we’re doing is completely different to what the pub was.
“Hopefully we’re still serving the same needs of the community and more of the community than before.”
The same fixtures and fittings from the original pub were salvaged from the rubble and are being used in the resurrected pub.
Mr Rees said it was “nice to be in the thick of it again and just feel that buzz” as pubs were allowed to open up indoors for the first time this year.
He believes the hospitality industry has been “scapegoated” during the pandemic and fears any changes to the Government’s roadmap out of lockdown could harm venues once again.
The final set of restrictions are due to be lifted on June 21, but concerns over the spread of the Indian variant have led to suggestions that could yet change.
“My concern is more that they’ll be pressurised into having to be seen to be doing something, so pushing a date back a week or two,” Mr Rees said.
“We are relying on the roadmap continuing as planned, because we’re not making much money as it is."
Do you have any stories? Let me know at ben.kempton@reachplc.com.Since the introduction of digital devices and artificial sound units within the early 1900s, electronic music has developed into a singular style. Roxy Music are fondly remembered by fans as one of the vital eccentric and weird rock acts of the Seventies and their self-titled first album is widely regarded as probably the greatest British debuts of all time. The group introduced us Bryan Ferry, probably the most attention-grabbing frontmen of the era, audio-transcoder.com as effectively as Brian Eno, one of the influential digital artists of all time, who’d go on to create a sequence of revered instrumental albums and produce records for the likes of Speaking Heads, U2 and Coldplay.
But by the Fifties many young musicians now not wanted to play in jazz orchestras. They wished the freedom to improvise and began experimenting in their very own bands. Earlier than long they had been taking part in exciting new types like bebop and modal jazz. These new kinds weren’t as easy to bop to as swing, so that they weren’t as widespread, but they discovered a new viewers of serious listeners for whom fashionable jazz was artwork music relatively than well-liked music. The best of those musicians included Charlie Parker, Thelonious Monk, John Coltrane, Miles Davis and Charles Mingus.
Again in the mid-’90s, all the pieces was looking rosy for the genre: normal folks hated it, completely satisfied hardcore had cut up off into its personal complementary genre that was similarly breakbeat-fuelled for a superb yr until this happened , and it was really pushing the boundaries of what digital music may very well be DnB raves have been nonetheless a bit edgy for mainstream audiences, but they attracted various crowds who have been there for the music no less than as a lot as the opposite stuff.
In the course of the Fifties, as rock and roll emerged, rock musicians and bands infused the weather of gospel and early blues into their music to form the class we’ve got come to know as rhythm and blues (R&B). New popular artists akin to Elvis Presley had a number of large hits singing blues-based mostly songs similar to Hound Dog.” Later performers like Ray Charles, Aretha Franklin, and BB King would make rhythm and blues an integral a part of the pop music scene. By the point the time period Pop” had been coined within the mid-50s, R&B and rock had replaced jazz as America’s most popular music style.
Your first main drawback, not one endemic to the genre however one which plagues it in a key means — there’s a plethora of bands that all sound the same and are in all probability very horrible. Partially as a result of undeviating” nature or lack of evolution inside the genre, dying metallic has a very discernible sound that can quickly change into hackneyed.

The style can be extensively in style amongst American teenagers , earning the second place and 15.3 % of votes in a survey in August 2012. The first place and more than 18 % of votes was awarded to pop music, rock scored 13.1 p.c and landed in fourth place. Apparently, Christian music made it to high 5 with nine percent of votes. The youthful generation can be widely represented among nation music performers with such distinguished names as Taylor Swift (born in 1989), who was the best paid musician in 2015, and Hunter Hayes (born in 1991).
Battle hardened in the clubs of Hamburg, the fab four reworked from squeaky-clear pop sweethearts to rock monsters during the course of their profession, and produced a few of the greatest music ever made along the way in which.

A fun/frustrating thing about shooting film is that you never know how your photos are going to turn out. Sometimes a little ray of light will make its way onto the film and cause these little leaks. Sometimes they block out your entire photo, sometimes they just add an extra splash of character. I have come to adore them. The following is a set of light-leaked photos I have accumulated over the past year.

It should be good news to border communities like Point Roberts, but sadly, that is not the case.
Since the Boundary Bay crossing closure, Point Roberts Chamber of Commerce president
Brian Calder has been lobbying to get the border open.
In a story we are running this week, Calder told the Optimist of the roughly 1.5 million pre-pandemic visits in 2018 and 2019, 50 per cent of them were for an hour or less.
As it stands now, travellers still have to have proof of a negative COVID-19 test within 72 hours of re-entering Canada. So that means day-trippers, who want to hop down to Point Roberts for cheaper gas, pick up a few groceries and or check in on their vacation properties, will likely not make that trip because of the added costs of a COVID test.
Who is going to go down to Point Roberts to support the businesses when they need to produce a negative test to go back when it’s likely the cost of the test will be more than you will spend on your shopping trip? It’s just not practical.
According to Canada’s Chief Public Health Officer Dr. Theresa Tam, there is no plan anytime soon to drop the required mandatory negative test.
There are exceptions to every rule, and in this case there definitely should be.
I get the need for safety. I get the need to be cautious, but if you are double vaccinated and have to show your vaccine passport to get into restaurants, theatres and sporting events here in B.C., and you don’t need a negative test to get into those establishments, shouldn’t those same rules apply when crossing the land border for day trips?
Canadian government officials need to change this policy and change it quickly. Point Roberts and other border communities are hanging on by a thread.The border will soon be open, but unless the rules are changed, this is just another slap in the face for the residents and businesses in Point Roberts and other border communities who depend on Canadian travellers to survive.7 Apr bjanee Escort Treat · @bijanee. fun loing girl who loves sex as much as you guys , love anal, deep throat, swalloing cum and much much more. 15 Aug Watch video Jessica Lloyd & Sami Jay prison girl on girl on Redtube, home of free Lesbian porn videos and Blonde sex movies online.

This website powered by Community Center software from LIAAAny CO-OP® who experiences a change in job or organizational requirements which affects their ability to practice to the full extent of the IOA Standards of Practice and Code of Ethics can notify the Recertification Committee of the change and their need to be moved to inactive status. An individual in inactive status will not be able to use the CO-OP® credential on resumes or business cards. Additionally, individuals in inactive status will not be listed on the certification website or other IOA publications as a CO-OP®.
Step One: A CO-OP® will identify a circumstance that would require them to disclose a change in their ability to use the CO-OP® credential with regards to point five on the CO-OP® Certification Agreement or points four or five on the CO-OP® Recertification Agreement—serving in an organizational ombuds position which no longer permits adherence to the IOA Code of Ethics and Standards of Practice—or in the case of an impending lapse in certification due to an inability to complete the required number of PDH for recertification within the four year window.
Step Two: The CO-OP® will send an email to [email protected]dsassociation.org requesting a move to inactive status, including the reason for the request.
Step Three: Once the Recertification/Renewal Committee has reviewed the request a member of the committee will contact the CO-OP® to verify the new status, verify the reason for the change, and communicate the process for reinstating active CO-OP® status.
Individuals wishing to be reinstated to full CO-OP® status must be able to demonstrate that they are once again able to practice to the full extent of the SOP and COE, as well as provide proof of 60 hours of professional development within four years prior to reinstatement. A nonrefundable administrative reinstatement fee of $150 applies.
Step One: An inactive CO-OP® sends an email to [email protected] requesting a reinstatement. Once the request is received, an invoice for the administrative reinstatement fee will be sent to the inactive CO-OP®.
Step Two: Once the invoice has been paid, a member of the Recertification/Renewal Committee will reach out to the inactive CO-OP® to verify the reason for reinstatement—adherence to Code of Ethics and Standards of Practice and/or 60 PDH within the past four years—and initiate the recertification process—verification of 60 PDH, signing of the recertification agreement, and payment of the $150 administrative fee.
Step Three: The CO-OP® will receive a reinstatement packet with their effective reinstatement.

So I have a confession to make. And perhaps it might make me seem un-American, un-patriotic, or just weird... I am not a huge fan of the fourth of July.
With the exception of some of the larger cities (Boston, New York, etc), I believe once you've seen fireworks, you've seen them all. I fully understand the meaning behind the day and why we celebrate it. I appreciate our independence and share my thanks every year. But I'm not one to plan a bunch of festivities or want to make a huge fuss about it otherwise.
I remember being a kid and getting excited about sparklers around this time of year. Oh, and the big packs of miscellaneous "safe" firework fun anyone could pick up off the shelves at the store. Like those snake things -- remember those? Do those even still exist? And those popper things you just threw at the ground and they popped really loudly. I equate the fourth of July with being a summer activity and being out of school. Being that I have been out of the last of my schooling for almost 10 years, it has completely lost its mystification.
Enter becoming a parent.
My son is finally at an age where I am comfortable with him holding sparklers -- and I say that very lightly. If you have never met my son, he is 150% boy, wild fire crazy with a level of energy I'm fairly confident if I could find a way to bottle it up I could sell on the black market and be set for a lifetime. But, he is 4 -- almost 5 -- so I am okay letting him hold his own sparkler.
I was taken back to that time of being a child, where I was excited about what this holiday equated to -- being out of school, playing with fire and other things that I couldn't any other day of the year... just enjoying something different.
Not to mention, my kiddo LOVES fireworks. And so does his dad -- still at 32 years old, he loves the fourth of July, the family and friend festivities and everything this holiday brings typically. Also, on a side note, I totally learned where my son gets his focusing facial expressions after I started looking at these pictures. :)
I remembered that just because I don't enjoy something doesn't mean I can't participate for my son... and my husband. It's not necessarily about what the holiday brings, but instead it's a reason that we as a society have deemed as a opportunity given to some to have time away from their jobs and normal daily life and can spend time with family -- eating yummy food, playing with sparklers and watching fireworks.
So, this year, I'm going to allow myself to be happy to be with my family and focus on that as opposed to the day item.
All of that said to say... Let freedom ring, Happy Independence Day! We truly are blessed to be free!3
While April 15 is known as Tax Day, Connecticut residents will need to keep working for another month just to pay off their total tax bill.
In fact, Connecticut residents are the last of any state in the country to pay off tax obligations, when combining federal, state and local tax bills. ordinary people of Palestine, who were normally considered by educated Jewish classes to belong to Am harez, the people of the land. This term was used in a derogatory fashion to describe those who were ignorant of the niceties and deeper values of Judaism and the Jewish way of life. In addition, Peter was a Galilean and therefore shared the spirit of independence and opposition to Jerusalem which was traditional in that northern province.
Recent researches into the daily life of the ordinary people in Palestine paint a fairly clear picture of Peter's social conditions: extreme poverty, a very fideistic approach to religion, a reliance on superstition, and an extreme dependence on the vagaries of natural elements. Furthermore, in the northern parts of Palestine, removed from proximate influence of Jerusalem, more revolutionary ideas easily took hold. Unrefined and undeveloped ideas about the Messiah and about the salvation of Israel easily took the form of political movements, extremist organizations, and a readiness to disassociate oneself from the authoritarian structure of southern Judaism.
The general atmosphere in Palestine when Peter reached his adult life in the mid-20s of the 1st century A.D. was one of tension over the universal presence of the Roman conqueror and foreboding born of a strictly religious persuasion that the arrival of the Jewish Messiah was imminent as the only possible solution for Israel's difficulties. Indeed, we find more than once in the Gospels that the followers of Jesus, headed by Peter, attempted to force Jesus to accept the role of king. Even after the resurrection of Jesus, Peter and the others asked him when and how he would restore the kingdom of Israel. It is certain that Peter's attachment to Jesus, at least in the beginning, was largely based on the persuasion that Jesus would indeed restore the kingdom of Israel and that Peter and the other Apostles would be leaders in the new era.
Association with Jesus
Peter and Andrew were among the first to be chosen by Jesus to be his close followers. Thereafter Peter accompanied Jesus everywhere. Jesus gave Peter the added name of Cephas, an Aramaic appellation meaning "rock." This was translated into Greek as Petros (from the Greek petra, "rock") and became the Latin Petrus and the English Peter. The Gospels differ as to when Jesus conferred this name on him.
Throughout the public life of Jesus, Peter is represented in the Gospels as the spokesman and the principal member of Jesus' followers. He is the first named in all the lists given of these followers and was present with a privileged few at special occasions: when Jesus brought the daughter of Jairus back to life; when Jesus had a special communication with Moses and Elias on Mt. Tabor; and in the Garden of Gethsemane on the night before Jesus died.. Jesus also said that he would build his new organization on Peter's leadership (Matthew 16:17-19) and entrusted his followers and believers to him (John 21:15-19). Many commentators have thrown doubt on the texts which ascribe this special role to Peter, but it is certain that the Gospels thus present Peter as the chosen leader.
The same character is assigned to Peter in the Acts of the Apostles and in the few references which we find in Paul's letters. Paul went to Jerusalem to see Peter and be approved by him. About 14 years later, it appears that Peter headed the Christian evangelization of the Jews, in distinction to Paul, who preached to the Gentiles, and to James, who was bishop of Jerusalem.
In the early days after the death of Jesus, Peter is presented in the Acts again as the leader of Jesus' followers. The Jewish Sanhedrin treated him as the leader, and he preached the first mass appeal to the Jerusalemites about Jesus. He also directed the economic life of the Christian community and decided who would be admitted to it. About 49, when the Christians faced their first major decision—whether to admit non-Jews to their group—it was Peter who received guidance from God and made a positive decision accepted by all the other followers of Jesus present. That there was a difference of opinion concerning doctrinal matters between himself and Paul is beyond doubt. Paul, besides, reproached Peter for a certain insincerity and even manifested independence from Peter.
We are told of various missionary trips which Peter undertook in order to preach about Jesus. He was finally imprisoned by Herod and released miraculously by an angel. He then "departed and went to another place" (Acts 12:17). After 49, we have no direct record in the Acts about Peter, and we have to rely on external testimony.
Roman Sojourn
From all we can learn and surmise, it does appear that Peter occupied a position of importance in Rome and was martyred there under the rule of Nero (37-68). The earliest testimony comes from a letter of Clement written about the year 96 in Rome. A letter of Ignatius of Antioch (died ca. 110) also implies Peter's presence and authority in Rome, as does the saying of Gaius, a Roman cleric (ca. 200). Gaius speaks of the Vatican shrine and the "founders" of this church. Finally, all the early lists of the bishops of Rome start with Peter's name as the first bishop.
Excavations at the Vatican have yielded no cogent and conclusive evidence either of Peter's presence in Rome or of his burial beneath the Vatican. They have, however, uncovered an ancient shrine which dates from approximately 160. Collateral evidence suggests that it was the burial site of some venerated figure, and Roman Catholic tradition identifies that figure with Peter. There is no direct testimony in the New Testament that Peter's position as leader of the Apostles was meant to be passed on to his successors, the bishops of Rome, as the primacy of the popes over all of Christianity. This is a separate question and depends on subsequent Church development and evolution of its beliefs.
Tradition designates Peter as author of two letters which carry his name, although doubt has been thrown on Peter's authorship of at least the second. Various apocryphal documents which certainly date from the 2d century are ascribed to Peter. There is also the fragmentary Acts of Peter, which purports to relate how Peter ended his life as a martyr.
It appears from the first of the two letters ascribed to Peter that his outlook as a Jew and a Semite was never influenced by Greek or other non-Jewish thought. He reflects the mentality of a 1st-century Jew who believes that Jesus came as the Messiah of Israel and as the fulfillment of all Israel's promises and expectations. Some of Peter's statements would not now be acceptable to orthodox Christian thought. From what we know of Peter and his life, he seems to have made the transition from Palestine to Rome as from one Jewish community to another Jewish community, never fundamentally changing his instincts as a Jewish believer, except insofar as he totally accepted Jesus as the Messiah of Israel.

Hello, I am wondering if any of you had the same issue as me and know to fix it. I sync my phone to the car, calls work fine but there is no media sound. I press Aux a few times, try connecting bluetooth again, but it still doesn't work. To be clear, for example, i can play youtube video but there is no sound. At first i did not have that problem, I could always listen to music on spotify (was not smooth but connecting to bluetooth again worked), but now I cannot find a way.Now that UEPI is collaborating on a biking summit with some great folks from LA's energetic bike movement (stay tuned for more news and links to a summit planning wiki), I decided to re-read Bike Riding in Los Angeles, a 1972 novel by Marc Norman, best known for writing the screenplay for Shakespeare in Love.
The book is a slim, expressionistic text without a real hero or overarching conflict. It features a character/narrator named The Bike Rider, cameos from his more out-there buddy The Phantom Bike Rider, and musings on bikes, history, living in Los Angeles, and what draws the region together - or whirls it apart.
Reading it, one picks up some little tidbits on bike culture circa the early 70s, like that "bike people" hung out "on the grass at Olympic and La Cienega." (p. 26)
The most poignant section, at least from a policy perspective (if regs and stuff can ever have emotional resonance) is the chapter entitled "The Pollution Question," that implies what role bikes can play in an autopia like Los Angeles. The chapter asks why, in such a big, populous, famous city:
there's no sense of a city, no feeling for the shared geographic experience. One answer might be that the people in Los Angeles can't see each other. This is not a frivolous statement.. (pps. 67-69)
So, LA: step out of your cars, get on your bikes, thin out the smog curtain, cycle a few miles, far enough to pass between those 3 mile self-seclusions, at a pace that allows you to notice other people walking or biking by. Make this more of a Place.
For bike related updates and a blogroll of cycling and alternative transportation sites, see streetsblog la
Sounds like a fascinating book!

Since it is the week before Christmas, and since we plan on taking Christmas week off from the blog, I thought it would be nice to talk about one of the most powerful superheroes in all of comic books.
He’s big, he’s red, he knows if you’ve been naughty or nice, and he’s listed as one of the most powerful mutants in the entire X-Men franchise…it’s SANTA CLAUS!
Origin and Career
Unlike most of the characters we talk about on this blog, this guy has had a long and illustrious career, and he didn’t even start off in comic books.
If you want to learn about the history of Santa, there are a couple of things you have to understand. For starters, many people use the names “Santa Claus”, “St. Nick”, “Kris Kringle”, and “Father Christmas” interchangeably.
All those names are actually talking about different people throughout history.
The Santa Claus that we know was made popular in the 1930’s as a figure who was used to sell Coca Cola. This was where we get the idea of a jolly man dressed in red with a big white beard and a red nose.
But that image was based off of an earlier drawing by famed political cartoonist Thomas Nast for Harper’s Weekly in 1881, who drew an incredibly popular illustration of the famous poem “A Night Before Christmas”.
This is where we get the idea of Santa with his reindeer and his fascination with giving out toys.
But THAT image was taken from old European Dutch traditions about a jolly old man named “Sinterklaas”, a jolly old man who travels around on Christmas dressed in red and giving out candy to good little boys and girls.
This is where we get the idea of Santa and his elves, since this version of Santa was accompanied by two beings called “Zwarte Piet” who help Santa hand out candy to the children.
It’s worth mentioning that this version of Santa has his origins with the Norse god Wotan, who would ride around on his eight legged horse Sleipnir around this time of year.
It’s also worth mentioning that “Santa” and “Father Christmas” are actually two different people because Father Christmas looks like this.
He’s still a pre Christian figure, just a bit different from the tradition of Santa.
But the real origin of Santa comes from the early Christian St. Nicholas.
St. Nicholas was originally Nicholas, a 4th century Christian bishop of Myra in what is now known as Turkey.
In the Eastern Orthodox tradition he is the patron saint of children, the falsely accused, repentant thieves, barrel makers, and a whole bunch of cities and nations that are too numerous to count. He’s a pretty popular saint.
The legend goes that the bishop had a friend who had the bad luck of only having daughters. Back then, the family of the bride was required to provide a payment to the family of the groom called a dowry as a sign of good faith and friendship.
Unfortunately, if the bride couldn’t provide a dowry the bride couldn’t be married, and the life of an unmarried woman back then was a very difficult one.
When Nicholas heard this he decided to do something about it and late one night he baked a bunch of gold coins into a loaf of bread, climbed up to the chimney of his friend’s house, and threw the loaf down the chimney.
and that is where we get the origin of Santa sending presents via chimney.
So what happened?
Oh, Santa Claus is still around, giving gifts and spreading good cheer.
In fact, he has been so good at it that during WW2, Adolf Hitler had Santa captured in an effort to strike at the morale of America.
Thankfully, Roosevelt had Captain America and Nick Fury of the Howling Commandos rescue Santa.
It was later revealed that Santa is actually the most powerful mutant/superhero ever created. His abilities are widely varied from longevity, to super speed, to the ability to manipulate his size in order to fit down a chimney of any size.
Santa has appeared in several adventures with famous Marvel and DC superheroes,
but it’s worth mentioning that he hasn’t always been a source of good cheer over the years.
Probably the best example of this was when he sold his entire gift making operation to Hydra because he was fed up with all the anger and lack of faith, although it did give us this.
Despite all the misadventures and silly stories, Santa has remained a force for good in comic books and the world in general His friendliness, kindness, and generosity have inspired people to live better lives and to be kind to each other during the Christmas season,
something that is sorely needed in times like these.
Merry Christmas everyone, and see you all next year.350 Montana will be tabling at the Missoula Farmers Market this summer starting July 14 and going thru the end of September.

Thanks for stepping up to the plate.D was the last race weekend for the BMW M3 and after six years of developing and racing the car, it felt like I was saying goodbye to a great old friend.
“I was the first to drive the M3 at the end of 1986 and I went on to do a lot of development work for the Schnitzer team. I was lucky enough to have guys like Emmanuele Pirro, Roland Ratzenberger and Ivan Capelli as my team mates in the BMW M3, so I remember those times as my ‘golden years ‘ in the sport.
“Between 1987 and 1992 I won many races in the BMW M3 and always stayed true to Charly Lamm and the Schnitzer team. We won the one-off World title in 1987 and then we won the European crown too before the DTM went our way the following year. It was a remarkable three year period for us and everything seemed to bond perfectly between me as the driver, Charly as team manager and of course the great M3.
“In 1992, BMW announced that they would be finishing in the DTM so it was a really tough season. The Mercedes-Benz was quicker for most of that year as we had stopped development of our car. But something magical happened on that day in Hockenheim as we went to write the final beautiful chapter for the M3.
“I actually cannot remember full details of the race but I know I qualified in third position. The race was a dogfight all the way between the pole sitter I and Kurt Thiim, but also Klaus Ludwig was right there too. Klaus though was not getting too involved as he was fighting for the title and needed to guarantee a finish for crucial points.
“The final few laps were completely over the limit. I got in to that mental zone where the focus and instincts are so well concentrated that all you see is the back of the car that is in front of you. There was simply no way I was not going to win that race and seeing the look Kurt gave me in the mirrors! Well, he knew it too!
“By the last lap I had caught the Mercedes and as we came in to the ‘Motordrome’ section I dived in to the left hand hairpin and snatched the lead. All I remember is hearing the crowd roaring from the grandstands. It was unreal, like a fairytale. It made me so happy.
“I got back to parc ferme and I remember just sitting for a few seconds in the car on my own. I was really emotional. The team were very happy but also crying at the same time because it was the last race weekend for the BMW M3. The car was just so special and to do the first few kilometres in it and then come right around to take the last win was a nice accomplishment. It is definitely the best race car I ever drove and I think it will become an icon of motor sport in the future, if it is not so already.”
Roberto Ravaglia
After a brief F3 career in the early 80s, Roberto Ravaglia became one of the most successful Touring Car drivers of all-time winning the ETCC twice in 1986 and 1988, as well as the first ever WTCC in 1987 as well. A DTM crown followed in 1989 followed by three Spa 24 Hours wins. After retirement the Roman set up his own team – ROAL Motorsport which continues his close links with BMW in the Blancpain Endurance Series in 2013.Halloween is this Friday, as you celebrate with costume parties and trick or treating, The Plainfield Fire
Protection District has some Halloween fire safety tips to keep your holiday celebration enjoyable:
• Avoid costumes with billowing or long trailing fabric and make sure eye holes on masks are large
enough to see out.
• Advise children to stay away from open flames (candles, touches, fire pits, etc.) and make sure they
know how to stop, drop and roll if their clothing catches on fire by stopping immediately, dropping
to the ground, covering their face with their hands, and rolling over and over to put the fire out.
• Have children carry flashlights or glow sticks while trick or treating.
• When decorating with cornstalks and crepe paper remember to keep them and other decorations
away from open flames such as candles, and heat sources like light bulbs and heaters.
• The safest way to light your jack-o-lantern is with a flashlight or battery operated candle. If you do
use a candle in your jack-o-lantern please keep it away from anything that will burn such as curtains
or other decorations, and locate it so it will not be near children trick or treating, doorsteps,
walkways and yards.
• Consider using flashlights as alternatives to candles or torch lights when decorating walkways and
yards. The concern is for children who may get too close to an open flame and whose costume may
brush against it.
• Always keep your exits clear of decorations so if there is a fire they do not block your escape route.
• When attending parties at others’ homes check for ways out of the home in the event of a fire and
plan how you would get out. Teach children to plan this way as well.
The Plainfield Fire Protection District would like to wish everyone a safe and happy Halloween. For more
information about fire and life safety please visit our web site at or you may call us

Are we all just 'dancing to the DNA' as Dawkins has put it, or are human beings more than amoral biochemical machines? Is there right and wrong and thus a moral absolute to guide our actions, or is such talk purely sentimental nonsense? It is said about the French atheist Voltaire that when his atheistic friends came over to dinner they were forbidden from speaking about their atheism in front of the hired servants who waited on table. Voltaire was fearful that if they should hear such godless talk and become convinces of what was said, they might steal his belongings and murder him in his sleep. He realised that the moral law and belief in future accountability for our actions kept his hired hands from crime! Immanuel Kant said that the moral law within filled him with 'ever new and increasing wonder and awe.'
We simply cannot have a moral society without God; history has proved it. The Bible teaches that we are created by God in his likeness - moral, spiritual and free - with his law of love planted in our consciousness. Jesus taught that, far from 'dancing to the biological law of the DNA', we have God's law of love to obey that requires love both for God and for our neighbour. The apostle Paul taught, 'In Him [God not DNA] we live and move and have our being' (Acts 17:28). We are infinitely valuable, created by God to know him.

How do you know when you want new brakes? There are many strategies to know if you want to have servicing or replacement of this auto element. It could be time to transform them out according to your automobile owner's servicing manual. Service schedules for every single automobile might differ based on how the automobile has been utilized.

Sundays blog gives us a chance to rethink some of what was talked about in the service at Point of Grace and process a little of what God might be saying to all of us through His Word!
The Scripture Text for today is Matthew 11:1-6,
.”
In the message today we followed the theme of "Trusting God" that adorned our entire week of Vacation Bible School.
No matter who you are ... ... Trust God! No matter how you feel... ... Trust God! No matter what people do ... ... Trust God! No matter what happens ... ... Trust God! No matter where you are ... ... Trust God!
Those themes resonated precisely with the John story! He was struggling with the dire condition of his own circumstances and sought out Jesus for hope and encouragement. Verse 6 really is profound. Jesus knows that some of the things He will do (like leaving his favorite prophet in prison) will make it hard for people to continue to "trust" Him. He offers blessing for all who will not fall away from faith even when He isn't the kind of God they thought they had and acts in ways that are disappointing and confusing for us humans.
It is in those times (like being in prison for Jesus when you know Jesus could free you) when circumstances do not seem fair or God seems to be distant that call for deeper levels of trust. It is those times that I tend to ask "Why?" alot. I think God is trying to move me to a deeper level of faith by converting my "Why?" to "How?" .......... From "God, Why is this happening?" to "God, Iam facing this big challenge, How are you going to lead me through it?"
The "How?" question leads me to stepping forward into life with anticipation andopenness to see how God is going to lead His child through the realities of life. I do not want this to sound parochial for idealistic but for me right now in my faith walk moving from questioning frustration to expectant openness is a big but very necessary step.
How did this text and this morning's worship and message strike all of you?
What is rolling around in your heart and mind? How is God getting your attention today?
Have a great week!
deltonMONTREAL — Hanging out at the mall to get away from mom or dad is no longer an option for some Quebec teens after their local shopping centre took the controversial step of banning people under the age of 18 unless accompanied by a parent.
Le Carrefour du Cap shopping centre, located halfway between Quebec City and Montreal in Trois-Rivieres, refused to comment on its decision.
But police and the local school board said Wednesday the mall recently banned unaccompanied minors from its property after receiving complaints that students from two nearby high schools were disturbing merchants at lunch time.
Trois-Rivieres police spokesman Luc Mongrain said he was surprised by the mall’s decision because he doesn’t consider the location to be particularly problematic.
He said officers were called to respond to loitering complaints about 10 times in the last year but did not make any arrests.
“It’s never in relation with a major problem, it’s more to disperse them and ask them to leave,” he said in a phone interview.
Youth between the ages of 12 and 17 are three times more likely than adults to be accused of property crimes such as theft or vandalism but are still responsible for a minority of the total property crime committed, according to a 2016 Quebec government report.
Mongrain said crime isn’t higher at the Carrefour du Cap compared to elsewhere in the city, despite the presence of numerous students.
“Every shopping centre makes complaints about shoplifting — most on a weekly basis — and this location isn’t targeted more than any other,” he said. “It’s not a major problem for us.”
Meissoon Azzaria, a spokesperson with Quebec’s human rights commission, wouldn’t comment directly on the case, but said it would be discriminatory to deny people access to a public place based on age.
The provincial Charter of Human Rights and Freedoms guarantees equal right to access public places, which include businesses, restaurants and hotels, according to Azzaria.
“A public place that would deny access to a group of individuals solely on the basis of such personal characteristics (for example, because they are ’young’), would be contrary to the principles of the Charter,” Azzaria said in an email.
Anne-Marie Bellerose, spokeswoman for the local school board, said the schools have received sporadic complaints about student behaviour at the shopping centre over the years, ranging from corridors being blocked to rare accusations of shoplifting or bullying.
Bellerose said the schools have worked with merchants in the past to address the issue and regularly remind students to behave respectfully in public.
“The situations we have (seen) are isolated cases involving a few youth,” she said in a phone interview. “As for the rest, the students behave well and are good customers, too.”
The schools, mall management and police are expected to meet next week to discuss solutions to the problem.Nestled behind the prestigious gates of Wingfoot, this spacious 4,800 square foot home features a half million-dollar interior remodel designed by Barbara Frey, completed Spring 2018.

Philippines country brief
Overview
The Republic of the Philippines is situated between the South China Sea and the Pacific Ocean and lies entirely within the tropics. The Philippines is an archipelagic country, consisting of 7,107 islands. The capital of the Philippines is Manila.
The Philippines’ population is approximately 106.65 million (2018, World Bank). The official languages are Tagalog and English. There are 19 officially-recognised languages and an estimated 187 indigenous languages, reflecting the Philippines’ diverse geography and eventful history. The Philippines is predominately Roman Catholic (80%), followed by Muslim Filipinos (5%). It is estimated over ten million Filipinos live overseas, comprising one of the world's largest diasporas.
Political Overview
The Philippines is a constitutional republic with a democratically elected presidential system and a bicameral Congress. It is governed as a centralised state with the exception of the Bangsamoro Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao (BARMM), which was established in 2019.
The President functions as the head of state, the head of government and the commander-in-chief of the armed forces. The President is elected by popular vote for a single six-year term, during which he or she appoints and presides over the cabinet. The Supreme Court is the highest court in the Philippines, appointed by the President.
Presidential elections were held in the Philippines on 9 May 2016. Nearly 44 million Filipinos participated in the election, comprising 82 per cent voter turnout. Rodrigo R. Duterte was elected President and Leonor 'Leni' Robredo was elected Vice President. The next Philippine Presidential election will be on 9 May 2022.
The Moro Islamic Liberation Front leads an interim government in the BARMM with parliamentary elections also due in 2022.
Economic Overview
Pre-COVID 19, the Philippines was one of the fastest growing economies in Asia with real GDP growing on average 6.3 per cent over the ten years to 2019. However, the pandemic hit the Philippines hard GDP plummeted to -9.6 per cent in 2020. Despite falling into recession, the country’s macroeconomic fundamentals remain sound.
The World Bank’s October 2020 Macro Poverty Outlook forecasts the Philippine economy to rebound to 5.3 per cent in 2021 and 5.6 per cent in 2022. This projection assumes that the country successfully manages COVID-19 transmission by early 2021. Access to foreign loans, manageable borrowing costs and a healthy foreign reserve buffer will help fuel the Philippines’ economic recovery.
As the Philippines emerges from the pandemic, there is considerable opportunity to expand upon existing trade, investment and economic ties. Australia’s proximity to the Philippines and its reputation as a supplier of quality materials and services are important factors in penetrating the market of 106.6 million (2018) people.
Demand in the Philippines for consumer goods and services – particularly for technical services, agricultural products, e-commerce platforms, cybersecurity and online education offerings – and its ambitious infrastructure investment agenda aligns well with Australian industry capabilities.
Australia’s total two-way goods and services trade with the Philippines was $5.6 billion in 2019, making the Philippines our 19th largest trading partner:
- Two-way trade in goods was valued at $3.6 billion in 2019. Agricultural, copper and precious metal ores are among Australia’s key merchandise exports to the Philippines, while electrical machinery, gold and manufactured goods are key imports.
- Two-way trade in services was valued at $2 billion in 2019. Education-related travel dominated Australian services exports to the Philippines, while our services imports were driven primarily by Australian tourists in the Philippines, reflecting our strong people-to-people links.
In 2018, total Australian investment stock in the Philippines was worth $9.8 billion. Over 300 Australian companies operate in the Philippines, employing over 44,000 Filipinos in the business process outsourcing, infrastructure, banking, telecommunications, energy and education sectors. The businesses benefit from the Philippines’ young, well-educated, English speaking talent pool.
A Bilateral Investment Treaty entered into force with the Philippines in 1995 and includes rules to promote and protect two-way investment.
Our existing trade agreement with the Philippines, the ASEAN-Australia-New Zealand Free Trade Area (AANZFTA), has reduced a wide range of tariffs on trade between Australia and the Philippines. We are both negotiating the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership (RCEP), which will build on the outcomes of AANZFTA to promote further growth in the region. Both countries are active members of the Cairns Group, a coalition of 19 agricultural exporting countries.
Bilateral relations
The Philippines-Australia partnership is long-term, two-way, equal and founded on mutual respect and understanding. It is defined by open communication, agreement on shared priorities, and recognising and responding to each other’s strengths. We engage across a broad range of foreign policy, trade, economic and strategic issues, support effective regional institutions and promote agreed rules and norms – engagement which is all underpinned by the 2015 Joint Declaration on the Comprehensive Partnership. A Plan of Action 2021-22 [DOCX 40 KB] was recently developed to reflect the current dynamics of the Indo-Pacific region and a more mature bilateral relationship. The Plan of Action also articulates how our two countries are to enhance the Comprehensive Partnership, and identifies both existing collaboration and new forms of cooperation to broaden the bilateral relationship, including supporting the COVID-19 response and contribution to economic recovery. On 23 August 2021 the Plan of Action was endorsed by Minister Payne and her Philippine counterpart Foreign Secretary Locsin at the Philippines-Australia Ministerial Meeting (PAMM). For more detail on the PAMM can be found in the Joint Minister Statement.
Strategic and security cooperation
Australia’s support for stability, maritime security and counter-terrorism helps the Philippine Government to manage security challenges in the South China Sea and Southern Philippines. Delivered by Commonwealth agencies (including Defence, Australian Federal Police and Australian Border Force) and Australian academic institutions, capacity building support is highly valued by counterparts.
Cooperation between Australia and the Philippines on strategic and security matters is underpinned by the Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) on Cooperative Defence Activities (1995) and to Combat International Terrorism (2003), and the Status of Visiting Forces Agreement (SOVFA) (2012). The SOVFA provides a legal and operational framework for Australia-Philippines defence cooperation.
The Australian military helped liberate the Philippines in 1943, during the Second World War. The Defence partnership is strong, long-lasting and the primary foundation for engagement between Australia and the Philippines. Australia has a significant interest in building the capacity of the Armed Forces of the Philippines as a capable force that can manage its own security, deter coercion and address the threat of terrorism. The Enhanced Defence Cooperation Program (E-DCP) sets the Philippines-Australia defence relationship on a long-term trajectory for closer engagement with a focus on military professionalism, counter terrorism, humanitarian assistance, disaster relief and maritime security.
Collaboration between the Australian Federal Police and the Philippines National Police led to the establishment of the Philippine Internet Crimes Against Children Centre (PICACC) in 2019, a hub for domestic Philippine and foreign law enforcement collaborative efforts to combat the online sexual exploitation of children.
Counter-terrorism cooperation
Terrorist organisations are based in the Southern Philippines, including some with links to Islamic State-East Asia. Several militant groups joined forces to launch attacks in Marawi City in May 2017. By September 2017, the conflict had displaced around 350,000 people and resulted in the deaths of more than 1,000 people. In response, Australia increased support for counter-terrorism capacity building, predominantly delivered by Defence, the Australian Federal Police (AFP) and security agencies.
During the siege of Marawi in 2017, ADF surveillance aircraft, naval frigates and specialist advisers provided assistance to the Armed Forces of the Philippines in their ongoing counter-terrorism operations. Counter-terrorism training following the recapture of Marawi in October 2017has trained over 10,600 members of the Armed Forces of the Philippines.
Maritime cooperation
Australia and the Philippines are natural maritime partners and share a common commitment to clarifying maritime rights peacefully and settling South China Sea territorial disputes in accordance with international law.
Areas of cooperation include strengthened maritime domain awareness and maritime border protection; greater regional and coastal interconnectivity; improved reliability and efficiency of shipping in the region; and more sustainable management of marine resources. Australia and the Philippines are working to enhance maritime cooperation by establishing a regular senior officials’ level dialogue.
Development cooperation
Australia’s new development strategy, Partnerships for Recovery, sets out how Australia’s development program will respond to COVID-19, including in the Philippines.
Australia supports a sovereign, stable and resilient Philippines that returns quickly to economic growth post-COVID-19. Our development partnership is an important and continuing part of Australia’s relationship with the Philippines. Total overseas development assistance (ODA) is estimated at $80 million for 2020-21.
The Philippines is particularly vulnerable to the effects of COVID-19 due to a stressed health system, high urban density and deep inequality. High infection rates and containment measures will have long-term economic impacts.
In partnership with the Philippines, Australia is responding by:
- bolstering health security by improving capacity to respond to the health needs that have both arisen from and been exacerbated by COVID-19
- fostering inclusive, cohesive communities and helping mitigate threats to regional security by supporting women and children, including through education programs and though our peacebuilding efforts in Mindanao
- strengthening policies and institutions to advance inclusive economic growth, including through social protection programs for the poorest and most vulnerable.
We are focused on what changes we need to make beyond the immediate response and have reflected these in the Philippines COVID-19 Development Response Plan , in close consultation with the Government of the Philippines.
Further information on Australian development cooperation in the Philippines.
People-to-people links
Australia and the Philippines have strong people-to-people links through trade, investment, cultural exchange, education, tourism and migration. Significant numbers of Filipinos have immigrated to Australia since the 1960s and Filipinos are the fifth largest immigrant community in Australia. According to the Australian Bureau of Statistics, 294,000 Australians identified as having Filipino ancestry in 2019, up from 175,000 in 2009.
Education ties between our countries are growing and Australia is now the number one destination for Filipinos studying abroad. There were 18,862 Filipino students enrolled to study in Australia in 2020, the 6th highest globally.Ken ;).

It's been renamed to Elite-A with hindsight, but there was a widely-circulated fan-made extended version of Elite for the BBC Micro that at the time was called 'Elite III'. Could something similar have happened here? How much was this Elite 2 like the original?

Today I came across an article about a Montana state legislator who proposed a bill to expand the states indecent exposure law to prohibit any clothing that simulated or revealed the buttocks, pelvic area etc- including yoga pants. It’s terrible enough to want to ban such a flattering and comfortable item of clothing, but what is most disturbing is what this suggestion says about a societal desire to police peoples bodies, especially women's.
Decency laws are justified by the idea that we are protecting the public from seeing inappropriate parts of our bodies, but we have to remember that these ideals of decency are 100% socially constructed.
Nipples on men and women look remarkably similar, yet men can expose their nipples without second glance while in most places it is illegal for women to do the same. ILLEGAL!!! Female nipples are the only source of nourishment for the first year or more of our lives. It is the only time a human can fully support another with just their own body and it is a miraculous thing. To a baby, a nipple is the source of life. To anyone else it signifies something inappropriate, explicit, obscene and even unlawful.
I wonder what exactly we are protecting people from and why we feel the need to hide our bodies even though we all have them and we all have seen other bodies hundreds of times. EVERYBODY has a butt and nipples yet we are expected to hide them like they are a shameful secret. If we aren’t even comfortable looking at bodies, how can we learn to love bodies in all shapes and sizes. How can we learn the intricacies of keeping ourselves healthy. How can we expect people to be safe and smart sexually.
Our bodies are more than arms, legs, chests, thighs, stomachs, noses, breasts, butts, nipples. Our bodies are worth more than judgments of individual body parts. If we allow ourselves to be open and comfortable with the body, norms of decency will fall into place naturally. If female nipples aren’t taboo, then they will not offend people the way they do now. Our norms around nudity should not make anyone feel there is something inherently wrong with their body, because this is much more hurtful that seeing a nipple could ever be.
Never let anyone tell you your body is anything to hide or be ashamed of. Expose your body as you see fit. Allow your body to be a full expression of who you are, the most beautiful work of art, created by nature to allow you to soak up this world.Working.

Best and most innovative approach to manage your production data
Gartner: 12 July 2016 – .”
Copy data management is revolutionizing the IT stack. Firms from all sizes are rethinking and redefining back up, disaster recovery and test data management strategies by using CDM technology. In addition, organizations that got their start by using one of the large cloud providers such as AWS or Azure are using copy data management technology to leave the complexity of the large-cloud and develop much more nimble and customized cloud infrastructures to reduce hosting expenses.
CDM technology allows a company to create virtual copies of data in a fraction of the time it takes to create a physical copy. These data copies can be managed more efficiently and effectively with simple to set up automated policies providing bullet proof back up and disaster recovery options for the entire enterprise. Using copy data management technology SLA’s can be reestablished to include all levels of the organization from a user’s personal desktop file(s) to an entire enterprise infrastructure.
With copy data management, the copy data repository is updated via log and change block tracking using compression and deduplication multiple times per hour. The result is a file that is typically much smaller than the sum total of all traditional copies of the production environment and in case of a recovery available in minutes not hours or days.
Copy data management is truly the next wave of optimizing the IT backroom and the CFO’s balance sheet. Besides reducing OPEX and CAPEX by reducing data storage by 80% to 90%, copy data management saves on software license costs because copy data management files are stored in native file formats and do not require duplicate software licenses to retain multiple copies.
Copy data management technology can also update and allows for more aggressive CTO and RPO standards and procedures to meet lightning quick recovery times.
Copy Data Management, (CDM) is revolutionizing how businesses manage data and create 21st century back up and disaster recovery strategies.

Abstract: Colorectal cancer is a leading cause of cancer death worldwide. To identify molecular targets for colorectal cancer therapy, we tested small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) against 97 genes whose expression was elevated in human colorectal cancer tissues for the ability to promote apoptosis of human colorectal cancer cells (HT-29 cells). The results indicate that the downregulation of PSMA7 (proteasome subunit, α-type, 7) and RAN (ras-related nuclear protein) most efficiently induced apoptosis of HT-29 cells. PSMA7 and RAN were highly expressed in colorectal cancer cell lines compared with normal colon tissues. Furthermore, PSMA7 and RAN were overexpressed in not only colon tumor tissues but also the other tumor tissues. Moreover, in vivo delivery of PSMA7 siRNA and RAN siRNA markedly induced apoptosis in HT-29 xenograft tumors in mice. Thus, silencing of PSMA7 and RAN induces cancer cells to undergo apoptosis, and PSMA7 and RAN might be promising new molecular targets for drug and RNA interference-based therapeutics against colorectal cancer.

Absolute worth refers back to the worth of a quantity with out regard as to whether it’s optimistic or destructive. It’s merely the gap from zero {that a} quantity sits. For instance, each +5 and -5 have an absolute worth of 5.
What Is a Worth Inventory?
A price inventory is one whose share worth is buying and selling under what a elementary evaluation would in any other case point out. If an evaluation of an organization’s fundamentals, similar to its earnings, dividends, money circulate, working earnings, and so forth, signifies that its inventory must be buying and selling at a particular worth, and the share worth is under that quantity, it’s thought of a price inventory. If an investor bought the inventory at this lower cost, they’d be getting worth because the inventory will almost definitely sooner or later right and improve in worth.OWINGS MILLS -- Ed Dickson and Dennis Pitta are well aware of what Rob Gronkowski and Aaron Hernandez did in New England last season.
How could they not be?
The Patriots' dynamic tight end duo took the football world by storm last year, especially Gronkowski, consistently creating matchup nightmares for opposing defenses and putting up some ridiculous numbers in the process.
Dickson and Pitta's numbers may not have been to the same level as their New England counterparts, but they do present their own share of matchup problems for opposing defenses.
Like the duo in New England, Dickson and Pitta are both big, athletic players who are almost like wide receivers in tight ends bodies.
And like the Patriots, the Ravens love to use that to their advantage, utilizing multiple packages with both Dickson and Pitta on the field at the same time.
Baltimore quarterback Joe Flacco said it will be more of the same this season.
"It's a pretty big (advantage) because we're able to do multiple things out of it," Flacco said. "You have to pick how you're going to defend us. Are you going to keep your regular package in there? Are you going to bring a nickel guy out, a little guy to cover one of those guys? We can kind of play off of that and see where we want to go."

-Nobody has given the FIFA World Cup tournament a nickname yet…
But after all the drama that has happened so far, it deserves one; something that has the word “surprising” or “shocking” in it because that’s what the competition has been all about so far.
After six days of non-stop action and following all the games and trends, we thought we’d share some of the things we think you should know about the tournament so far. Some you may have noticed, others you may not have.
A World Cup of goals
As of the time of writing this, 17 games have already been played. That’s one-quarter of the amount of games to be played during the duration of the event. And of all that has happened, have you noticed that no game has ended goalless since the competition began?
Even when teams like Egypt defended so well against Uruguay, the net was still rattled. Games in group B, G and H featured the most of goals after the first round of group games.
Surprising results?
As far as the World Cup goes, there’s one thing that fans can agree on: it has been a tournament of surprising results.
The All-Star Brazil team succumbed to the Swiss. The German machines were gunned down by the Americans. Then there was Lionel Messi’s penalty loss and the two results that have turned Group H on its head.
Penalties
Another surprising trend in this World Cup has been the amount of spot-kicks that have been awarded – either via the V.A.R or via the referee spotting the incident himself.
In the first round of group games, which featured 16 games, at least 8 penalty kicks were awarded. That’s one penalty for every two games played.
Click here to make your predictions and earn yourself some extra cash.
Red cards
For all the feistiness and the complexity of the tournament so far, only one red card has been shown since the first game on Thursday.
Colombia’s Carlos Sanchez became the first player to see red in Russia. His red card was also the second-fastest the competition has ever seen.
This World Cup has been more about the attacks and pressing and defending, rather than harsh, unreasonable tackles. But it’s football and there should be a few more red cards shown before the end of the competition.

Who else is looking forward to the second round of games?Gary Comenas (2014)

After the run at the Cinema Rendezvous, The Chelsea Girls opened at the Regency at the beginning of 1967 - "Released through The Film-Makers' Distribution Center."
Village Voice ad, 5 January, 1967
In the same January 5th issue, there was an ad for the Film-Makers' Cinematheque at the 41st St. Theatre at which Bob Neuwirth was presenting "film comedies" starring Edie Sedgwick who was referred to as "a real Chaplin."
Village Voice ad, 5 January 1967, p. 22
According to Popism, one of Edie's complaints to Warhol in 1965 was that everyone was laughing at her because of her appearances in his films:
Pat Hackett writing as Andy Warhol in Popism (p. 122-123):
"During the summer and fall [of 1965], Edie started saying she was unhappy being in underground movies. One night she asked Mel and me to meet her at the Russian Tea Room for a 'conference.' She wanted him to arbitrate while she explained to me how she felt about her career... That night she said she'd decided that she definitely was going to quit doing movies for the Factory.
Jonas Mekas had just offered us a lot of consecutive nights' screenings at the Cinematheque to do whatever we wanted with, and we thought it would be fabulous to have an Edie Sedgwick Retrospective - meaning, all of her films from the last eight months. When we'd first thought of it, we all thought it was hilarious, including Edie. In fact, I think Edie was the one who thought of it. But now, this night at dinner, she was claiming that we only wanted to make a fool out of her. The waiter moved the Moscow Mules astride and put our dinners down, but Edie pushed the plate aside and lit up a cigarette.
'Everybody in New York is laughing at me,' she said. 'I'm too embarrassed to even leave my apartment. These movies are making a completely fool out of me!'"
And yet, here, was her boyfriend/manager Bob Neuwirth presenting her as a comedian in an ad in the Village Voice.
The ad also mentions an "Open House" where filmmakers could bring their films to be screened. But, again, this was not a midnight screening, but took place at 8 pm.
On February 2nd, The Chelsea Girls moved to the York Cinema - again released through the Film-Makers' Distribution Center, as stated on the ad:
Village Voice ad 2 February 1967
By April, The Chelsea Girls was at the St. Marks Theatre:
Village Voice ad, 20 April 1967
In addition to showing Warhol's major films like The Chelsea Girls (and later in the year, **** (Four Stars), through the Film-Makers' Distribution Center, Mekas continued to show Warhol films at the "Cinematheque" then operating out of the 41St. Theatre. Below is an ad from the 27 April issue which includes Willard Maas' film, Andy Warhol's Silver Flotations and an Open House at 8 pm.
Village Voice ad, 27 April 1967, p. 27
And below is an ad from July 1967 which includes screenings of Warhol's Vinyl, Poor Little Rich Girl, Camp plus Bruce Torbet's documentary on the artist, Superartist:
Later in July, an ad appeared which indicated that the 41st St. Theatre was being used both for the Cinematheque screenings and for the Film Distribution Center:
Village Voice ad, 27 July 1967, p. 19
The ad is interesting for several reasons. First is the inclusion of Gerard Malanga's film. At the same time that Warhol was making underground films, Gerard started making his own films - this one featuring Rene Ricard, International Velvet and what looks like "Chase Mellon." (I've been unable to find much on the net about a Chase Mellon, although there was a Chase Mellon III who owned a Beverly Hills mansion that Sly of Sly and the Family Stone started renting from him in 1993. I have no idea if that is the same Chase Mellon - if anyone knows who Mellon is, email me at garycom@blueyonder.co.uk.)
Although the bottom half of the ad includes releases by the Filmmakers Distribution Center, Mekas did not announce the formation of the FDC until the 7 September issue of the Village Voice (see below). The stated purpose of the FDC was to distribute films that had a wider public appeal than most of the underground films shown by Mekas at his Cinematheque.
In August of 1967, Mekas was still using the 41st St. Theatre as his Cinematheque. He screened a week of films by Marie Menken and her partner, Willard Maas. (According to Gerard Malanga, Maas was the unseen person giving the blow job in Warhol's film Blow Job.)
Village Voice ad 3 August 1967
In the 7 September 1967 issue of the Village Voice, an ad announced that the 41st St. Theatre would be renamed the 42nd Street Cinema and would be used by an offshoot of the Film-Makers' Co-op, "the Film-Makers Distribution Center," to show films that "have a need (according to the film-makers' wishes) of wider audiences..." Later, the name of "New Cinema Playhouse" would also be used for the venue.
Wooster Street
According to the ad, two other venues would be used as the Film-Makers' Cinematheque - Cinematheque I at Wooster Street for anyone who wanted to show their films and Cinematheque II which would show "carefully selected" films.
Village Voice ad, 7 September 1967, p. 30
Mekas wasn't just announcing the establishment of three venues in his ad, he was also announcing the creation of a new borough. At the bottom of the ad is the statement, "the establishment of the Cinematheque 1 and Cinematheque II downtown creates a new borough of New York which from now on will be called The South Village."
The Fluxus artist George Maciunas (who was, like Mekas, a Lithuanian refugee) had purchased all or part of the buildings at 16-18 Greene Street and 80 Wooster Street for use as artists' co-ops.
Roslyn Bernstein & Shael Shapiro (Illegal Living: 80 Wooster Street and the Evolution of Soho, 2010):
"Avant-garde art was radically changing the cultural landscape of New York City and the artistic centers of Europe. But in New York, artists were not able to earn enough money to live and work. Apartment prices were too high for most artists, who also needed to rent additional space in which to create their art works. Indeed, without viable live-work space, there would be no art. Maciunas came up with a brilliant vision: cooperative loft living.
Maciunas loved manifestos. For his new project he published a one-page manifesto titled A FLUXHOUSE PLAN FOR AN ARTIST CONDOMINIUM IN NEW YORK CITY. In it he set forth the economic problem facing artists and proposed a solution. He envisioned purchasing under utilized loft buildings through a not-for-profit cooperation and renovating them to provide living-work spaces for artists... The first building, 16-18 Greene Street was to become Fluxhouse Cooperative I. His second planned co-op at 80 Wooster Street was designated Fluxhouse Cooperative II..." (RB45-47)
Although 80 Wooster Street would remain a Fluxhouse Cooperative, Maciunias had apparently only purchased "four spaces" in Greene Street. After residents became irate over Maciunias' failure to pay real estate taxes, they unaffiliated themselves with him through their solicitor.
Roslyn Bernstein & Shael Shapiro:
"Inevitably there were problems. After a short time, the 16-18 Greene Street building, which was to have been Fluxhouse No. 1, discontinued its relationship with Maciunas. Although she acknowledges that Maciunas was involved with their building, Ingrid Wiegand, who with her husband Bob was an original owner in the Greene Street building and a political activist, says without hesitation: 'The building was never a Fluxhouse; it was always the Greene Street Precinct.' However, Maciunas still controlled ownership of four spaces in the building, which he purchased with money from his sister. He rented them out to his workers...
When they discovered that Maciunas had not paid the building's real estate taxes and owned money to his workmen, the Greene Street residents became irate... Bob Markowich, the lawyer for the cooperative women's gallery A.I.R. on Wooster and Broome Streets... engineered the separation from Maciunas and got the Greene Street building reorganized to form a true residential co-op unaffiliated with the Fluxhouses." (RB54)
Although the Village Voice ad above indicates that the Greene Street location was to be an "Academy" where the best of the avant-garde cinema would be shown - a bit like the later Anthology Film Archives - it never happened.
Roslyn Bernstein & Shael Shapiro:
"Only one of the new spaces was ever created: Cinematheque I at 80 Wooster Street, an address that was to become identified with the brave, the bold, and the risky in film and the arts. Although Mekas planned to have 260 seats, he could not obtain the special permit needed for a public assembly of that size, so the new theater had only 72 seats. (RB75)
Mekas didn't immediately use the venue at Wooster Street because it apparently needed extensive refurbishment. According to his chronology ("Showcases I Ran in the Sixties" in To Free the Cinema) he didn't start using Wooster Street until early 1968, although Village Voice ads indicate that the first showings were in December 1967 (see below) .
Mekas also continued to release films through the Film-Makers' Distribution Center. On 14 December, 1967 an ad appeared in the Village Voice for the one and only showing of Warhol's "25 hour film" **** (Four Stars) on Friday 15 December 1967 at the New Cinema Playhouse at 120 West 42nd Street.
The Village Voice, 14 December 1967, p. 49
The address of the New Cinema Playhouse was the same address of the 41st St. Theater which Mekas had renamed the 42nd St. Cinema in the 7 September ad above. The address given for the 41st St. Theater in a previously produced ad from 25 November 1965 is "125 West 41 St. or 120 West 42 St." (The venue apparently had two entrances.) In other words, the New Cinema Playhouse was the same venue as the 41st St. Theater which was the same venue as the 42nd St. Cinema.
Although Mekas' Film-Makers' Distribution Center is not mentioned in the ad for the full version of ****, it does appear on the ad for the shorter version of the film that appeared in the 21 December 1967 issue of the Village Voice:
The Village Voice ad for the two hour version of **** (Four Stars), 21 December 1967, p. 41
In the same issue of the Voice that carried the ad for the full version of **** (Four Stars), Mekas announced the opening of Wooster Street.
Jonas Mekas, "Movie Journal," The Village Voice, 14 December 1967, p. 48
The Wooster Street Cinematheque actually opened in December 1967 as the ad on the lower left corner of the above page from The Village Voice shows, as well as the ad at the bottom of this page.
Meanwhile, in the same issue (14 December) an ad appeared for "Underground Films at Noon" at the New Cinema Playhouse, although there is no indication that Mekas had anything to do with these screenings:
Village Voice ad, 14 December 1967, p. 48
The account that Mekas gives of his venues in his column in the 14 December issue does not always agree with what was advertised in the Voice. He writes that the Cinematheque opened in December 1964 at the New Yorker Theatre. This agrees with the ads more or less - the 26 November 1964 Village Voice ad (above) gave the first screenings as 30 November. The films on the 30th included Andy Warhol's Newsreel.
Mekas continues by writing that after the New Yorker, the Cinematheque "moved to 42nd Street and Tenth Avenue." This was presumably the Maidman Theatre which was located at 416 West 42nd Street. As noted earlier, Mekas wrote in his chronology of showcases - "Showcases I Ran in the Sixties" - that screenings were held at the Maidman from January 18th to the 26th." [See page three for Maidman schedule.]
Mekas goes on to write, "In Spring 1965 it [the Cinematheque] went all the way down to the City Hall Cinema." This, again, more or less agrees with the Voice ads - the first ad for the City Hall Cinema was for the February 4th showing of Mekas' film Guns of the Trees. Mekas continues: "Then zoom, it went to 4th Street, where it never got started [see page three], so it opened at the Astor Playhouse, on Lafayette Street."
Village Voice ads show screenings from June to November 1965 at the Astor Place Playhouse. Mekas announced the move to the Astor Place Playhouse in the 27 May 1965 issue of the Voice.
The Village Voice, 27 May 1965, p. 19
Mekas continues "it stayed there until December 1966 when it moved to 41st Street where it remained until last July." According to Mekas, the Cinematheque "has been closed since then." But there were advertised Cinematheque screenings after July. In addition to the Menken/Maas screenings in the ad reproduced above for August, there was also a screening on August 17th, as per the ad below:
Village Voice ad, 17 August 1967
Although Mekas' column might give the reader the impression that there was a dearth of experimental or independent screenings as a result of him no longer using the 41st St. Theatre as his Cinematheque, the venue continued to show experimental films, including the work of Jack Smith, under the name "New Cinema Playhouse."
The Village Voice, 23 November 1967
The above ads don't mention any of Mekas' entities (i.e. the Film-Makers' Distribution Center or the Cinematheque) but Mekas was a champion of Smith's work and the ad does quote him. Later in the month, a similarly designed ad for a Shirley Clarke screening, along with the Lenny Bruce film, appeared in the Voice which did indicate that it was an FDC evening.
Village Voice ad 30 November 1967
Although the FDC screenings are of interest because they had to do with Mekas, they weren't considered "Cinematheque" screenings. We've already seen that there was an ad for the Cinematheque I (Wooster St.) on the same page as Mekas' column above (see the ad for 14 December above). In the following issue, there was a much more professionally designed ad for the venue which gave the December 1967 schedule:

>Installing Windows XP from Scratch on VAIO VGN-UX390N
A couple weeks ago I bought a Sony VAIO UX from someone on eBay. The unit had been updated to Windows 7 from Windows Vista Business. Vista Business was the OS installed on the device from the factory, but as we all know, Windows Vista was worse than Windows 8. Very unstable due to a rushed release, and Microsoft never really “fixed” it. Windows 7 was much better, but with the VAIO UX only having a single core CPU at just over 1Ghz and 1GB of RAM, the unit barely meets the minimum specs for Windows 7. The Windows 7 install didn’t leave much space on the included 30GB SSD either.
Older models of the VAIO UX from the model I have all shipped with Windows XP Pro (32-bit). Throwing caution to the wind, I decided to nuke the entire contents of the SSD and install Windows XP from scratch. I dug out an old USB DVD-ROM drive that I haven’t had to use in ages, along with a couple of my old spools of CD and DVD media that had been collecting dust in a closet. I was able to find a Windows XP Pro installation disc with a volume license key, so I jumped in.
Windows XP Installation / Driver Files
Installing Windows XP on the device is just like installation on any normal PC that supports booting from CD-ROM. Fn+F2 upon startup launched the BIOS utility, which allowed me to specify the CD-ROM drive as my first startup drive. After that, installation was straight forward. When installation was complete, I ran in to some issues though.
Touch screen, mouse nub, and IEEE 1394 Firewire all worked out of the box. No special storage controller driver had to be specified during install. The XP installer saw the SSD right away. I was also able to run the display at 1024×600 native res right out of the box at 32-bit color, but it was sluggish and obviously using universal drivers. The back-lit keyboard worked and back-lights the keys as soon as you start using them.
I decided to pop in to Device Manager and see what driver Hell awaited me. Ugh.
As you can see, there are a lot of drivers missing. The first resource I checked was Sony’s own site, which was of no help. Because of the age of the device, and because Windows XP is no longer supported (even by Microsoft), Sony had removed all of the drivers for the entire UX line from their website. Thanks guys.
Because of this I was forced to search for specific chipset models used for each device in the VAIO UX, and find drivers elsewhere. A lot of the Intel drivers for things like wireless, the motherboard chipset, and even the GMA video drivers have been scrubbed from Intel’s site. Again, not helpful.
In the end, after hours of searching and testing, I was able to compile a full suite of drivers from multiple sites that removed all of the yellow exclamation marks from Device Manager.
I have uploaded that driver archive for download here.
I should note that after getting the Wi-Fi drivers installed, I let Windows Update run and it installed over 130 updates. One of these updates were the drivers for the “Audio Device on High Definition Audio Bus” – which is a fairly generic Realtek sound driver. The drivers included in my pack are as follows:
- TI Card Reader Driver (directory) – For the Sony MemoryStick DUO slot (must be installed manually through Device Manager to browse for driver). This initially shows up as “Mass Storage Controller” in Device Manager after XP install.
- Sony Ethernet (directory) – Marvell Yukon driver for the wired LAN on the VAIO UX dock.
- Fingerprint Co-processor (directory) – For the fingerprint reader on the device, does not include dual-factor login software.
- Wi-Fi.exe – Installs Intel a/b/g wireless drivers, also installs Intel’s Wi-Fi Utility, which I hate, but I’m not going to be using this device networked anyway due to XP’s vulnerabilities.
- Video.exe – Intel GMA 945 video drivers.
- Sony Camera Drivers.exe – Drivers for the forward-facing camera on the device, this initially shows up as only “USB Device” in Device Manager after XP install.
- Intel Chipset.exe – Intel motherboard chipset drivers.
- Bluetooth.exe – Generic Bluetooth drivers.
Testing and Conclusion
It took much longer to find the drivers for everything than it did to actually install Windows XP, even with this small amount of RAM and weak CPU. There are now no unknown devices in Device Manager, and everything seems to be working fine. I have tested the Ethernet and an external monitor with the dock and it can mirror or extend displays without a problem. I was even able to play Duke 3D on an external monitor while mirrored to the UX’s LCD display and it worked great.
There are a couple of proprietary things that I was unable to find, namely the application installers from Sony for the Zoom keys on the front of the unit, the VAIO Camera software, and the software for the Dashboard Launcher which is invoked by pressing the dashboard button on the front of the UX. As it sits, those buttons simply don’t do anything right now. The camera can still be used in other applications. Finding that software will be the final piece to the puzzle, and if I can find it I will update this post and host it for download.
If you are trying to bare-bones install Windows XP on a UX, good luck. I hope this post helps out.

One small nitpick: as someone who has been running Vista x64 on his primary desktop between late 2008 and mid-2018, I object to slandering its name 🙂 Microsoft eventually did “fix it” (and in some ways it was more that the hardware vendors came out with stable working drivers). Post SP1 Vista is rather solid, and I found it even a bit more stable than Windows 7. With that said, on a 1GHz/1GB system, such as this VAIO, neither would be able to provide a satisfactory user experience.
I know the pain in manually hunting for manufacturer drivers for specific OSes. Kudos for providing the step-by-step. 🙂
I worked in IT when Vista came out and we rolled it out to hundreds of machines. It was very problematic at first. To be honest I never really used it personally (I stuck with Windows XP until Windows 7 came out), but I do remember having to roll back a ton of machines to XP because our business customers weren’t happy with Vista’s stability, speed, and compatibility with software. On a full PC I don’t imagine it would be that bad after the software fixes (you mentioned SP1) but on this VAIO it was pretty slow. The VAIO is just too underpowered to run it well at all, and with only 1GB of RAM, there’s just not enough to keep it from doing a lot of memory swapping via the slow EMMC SSD. I’m still looking for those Sony apps. Haven’t found them yet. :-/Field Office Administrator- Field Office Administrator (FOA) to support the Task Force Safety Assessments for Fire and Electricity (TF SAFE) contract The FOA will provide overall daily support and general office support to the Operations Center, Project Manager and PMO staff FAO will perform standard administrative functions that require handling highly important and confidential and or classified nature This position is contingent upon contract awardResponsibilitiesPerform standard administrative functions that require handling highly important and confidential and or classified natureAssist in employee onboarding, mobilization and demobilization, conduct exit interviews and coordinate personnel movement within the AOR; to include mobilization, R&R, and Emergency LeaveEdit and format reports, and update and distribute meeting notes and conduct routine correspondenceComplete other duties as assigned for project successPreferred QualificationsActive Secret Security Clearance:Administration

Not MentionedTUNE INTO TIMBUKTU19.02.2016
Kif. Malian singer/songwriter, Inna Modja’s bold, conscious, hip-hop-pop is brought all the way to You[tube] from Timbuktu and lays a sucker-punch to pop music’s mouth…
The track busts off her latest album Motel Bamako and although it may look like your average Blipster music video, Modja speaks out against the current political instability in Northern Mali and violence against women – bra-less and in a Thomas Sankara T-shirt. A bold move by the young singer since secular music, music videos and other media were banned under extreme interpretations of Sharia Law in 2012. Still, Youtube and protest prevail.
One of seven kids, the French-speaking artist was supposedly influenced by her older siblings’ Thrash Punk, 80/90’s Rap and Heavy Metal teenage rebel phases; as well as her Pappa’s classic Ray Charles and Ella Fitzgerald records. The lucky sister also grew up nextdoor to the Grandaddy of Afro-Pop, Salif Keita, who encouraged her to join in his jam sessions.
Although the French-speaking Femcee has transitioned into a more bounce-’round-in-yo-bedroom/pop/soul sound since then – ‘Tombouctou’ is the perfect track to pump on the way to the beach or the next [Kak Thing] Must Fall protest…
Big up to all the bold Malian musos, artists and activists like Moussa Remi Mariko, Mamou Daffe, Songhoy Blues and so many more speaking up and out for the people of Mali (and the world) with fireballs of flavour! For more on the music ban in Mali check out the documentary ‘They Will have to Kill us First‘ which screened at the Durban International Film Festival in 2015. Rumour has it that Inna Modja will also be pulling into to Durban’s Zakifo Muzik Festival 2016. Watch this space!

It’s not every day that an animal only a few inches tall and weighing in at just a couple grams will cause people to drive from all corners of the state on the mere hope of catching a glimpse, but that’s exactly what happened over the course of a few weeks when a Black-chinned Hummingbird showed up at a feeder in the backyard of a home in Galloway, Ohio just west of Columbus.
Hummingbirds are one of the most beloved of all birds, and even non-birders seem enthralled by the way they hover among flower blooms to drink the sweet nectar before buzzing off like a bumblebee on steroids. So, when a species of hummingbird that has never before been recorded in the state of Ohio shows up unexpectedly, you can imagine the fervor that swept through the birding community and turned a residential yard into an arena for clamoring naturalists to fawn over this pint-sized feathered rock star.
The birding community is one of the most passionate subsets of wildlife enthusiasts in the world, and the network of spreading information about rare or unusual sightings is quick to get the word out whenever something odd shows up. Usually these vagrant species ride in on some form of extreme weather front where the high winds and dynamic barometric pressures cause the birds to be pushed off course from their usual routes. The Black-chinned Hummingbird is but the latest in a string of similar sightings that include recent rare visitors such as a Brown Booby that showed up at a Summit County reservoir back in August of this year.
While both of these examples were first-time occurrences in documented history, there are other bird species that arrive with semi-regularity but are still considered vagrants or wanderers. Snowy Owls venture south from the Canadian tundra nearly every year, but always manage to draw a crowd wherever they are spotted. The stylish plumage of the Harlequin Duck makes this occasionally visiting waterfowl a big hit for both casual and professional birders alike, but sometimes it takes a more trained eye to pick out minute differences that set apart an uncommon bird from one of our normal residents.
Back in 2018 several amateur birders positively identified a couple of vagrants with much less conspicuous appearances. A Gray Kingbird was spotted in a Clark County park and a Northern Wheatear was spotted by a landowner on their farm in Richland County. The kingbird’s arrival seemed to coincide with the remnants of Hurricane Michael pushing through the area, and it was widely assumed the bird was carried north from its typical Caribbean range by the storm. The wheatear’s appearance might be more tied to the species’ incredible migration path that takes it annually from Canada, across the Atlantic Ocean, to the shores of western Africa. Perhaps the individual caught hanging out on a farmer’s woodpile was forced off course by weather or maybe it was just taking the scenic route, but after a few days in northern Ohio it disappeared and most likely continued on its overseas journey.
While we have seen repeated encounters with rare species tied directly to singular, extreme weather events, we are also starting to see broader range expansions and shifts by various species of animals, not just birds, that seem to be trending northward. Birds tend to be the first noticed because of their high mobility, but insects, mammals and even fish species that were once considered subtropical can now be found making Ohio their permanent home.
As winter seems to have finally arrived in force with this week’s early snowstorm, pay attention to the woods and your bird feeders for anything unusual that may turn out to be the next big celebrity of the birding world.Successfully Delivering Solutions of Microsoft SharePoint from the very First Release SharePoint 2001 to the Latest SharePoint release

Online gambling has many means for different online players, while some consider is a healthy time pass option; others take it as their addictive habit. In both cases, online gambling industry is the clear winner, coz no matter what the objective or reason for playing online casino games, casinos are here to make their money through numerous active players they add in their data base. Professional casino players always advise new players to limit their casino sessions and wagering amount, and expect them to first understand the games and their true virtue before involving blindly with them. For every intelligent casino player, there is a specific limit for his wagering and his winnings, i.e., both these limits decide when he should leave the desk if he is winning, and similarly; when he should leave the desk when he is losing. Passionate players don’t take these guidelines seriously, so they often caught in a bad situation where they find nowhere to leave – finally. Even though, online casinos are not be affected by their players’ losing piles of money, but for their social responsibility concerns, they inform their players frequently about their casinos sessions, money balance, and issue a warning if they have crossed a warning level.

12th – 14th June at Muchlney, Somerset
This comprehensive master class brings together some of the most experienced users and tutors of the Austrian Scythe from across the. UK and Europe.
It is the premier opportunity to learn all there is to know about the scythe and it’s use and to take your scything on to the next level. It is also useful for those looking to use the scythe with volunteers or wanting to move into teaching.
The two day course gives plenty of opportunity to go in depth into the world of scything. It is an excellent chance to go beyond the basics and improve your mowing, peening and sharpening techniques. Questions on all aspects of scythe use are welcome and there is a wealth of experience to be found amongst the tutors. With a high tutor to pupil ratio participants receive plenty of personal attention.
It is also an excellent opportunity to meet and socialise with fellow scythe enthusiasts from across the UK, both on the course it’s self and with members of the Scythe Association of Britain and Ireland (SABI) during the SABI day and AGM on Saturday
And of course, the experience culminates with the West Country Scythe Festival on Sunday. Always enjoyable, with plenty of activities and fun and perhaps an opportunity to put some of your newly fine tuned skills to the test during one of the Scything Competitions?
Participants should have attended a one day scythe course or have some experience of using the scythe before booking on the Scything Master Class. For more information on the course and to book, see here.
The Tutors:
Simon Fairlie
Simon imports the Austrian scythe to the UK and runs The Scythe Shop. He was responsible for reintroduction of the Austrian scythe early in the 21st century when he was struggling to find adequate tools for hand hay making locally. He has vast experience of hand hay making to feed horses and cows, both at Tinkers Bubble and now at Monkton Wyld. He instigated early scythe training in UK, inviting renowned Scything Master Peter Vido to teach at the first ever UK scythe festival in 2005, and has since taught many people to scythe himself.
Christiane Lechnear
An very experienced user of the scythe from Austrian, Christiane has taught scything in Austria and the UK. She is also a yoga teacher and uses her knowledge to improve people’s scything technique. She has a deep knowledge of the scythe and it’s use in Austria.
Steve Tomlin
Based in Cumbria, Steve originally learnt to scythe in France, then became involved with the UK scything world after attending the first UK scythe festival as a hay rake maker and green wood worker. He is an experienced teacher and has taught many people and groups across the UK. He is able to give a thorough analysis of people’s scything technique and help create improvements.
Phil Batten
Based in SW Wales, Phil learnt to scythe at the first UK scythe festival with Peter Vido and has been mowing and improving ever since. He has built up a large base of experience with the scythe, having been using it to manage the land of Dyfed Permaculture Farm Trust for eight years. He is exploring techniques for integrating the use of the scythe in all aspects of management of a small holding, from hand haymaking to management of gardens, rough margins and areas of permanent planting. A student of Tai Chi, he integrates aspects of the discipline into scything techniques to improve ease, effectiveness and to be gentle on the body. An experienced teacher, he has taught scything at the Trust and the festival for many years.The Gadget Show's Jason Bradbury launches Dot Robot. And it's got a girl in it!

Here … More Woman versus Breadfruit — Barefoot in BarbadosAn emergency search is underway in rural Teller County for “General Roy,” a Chinese domestic duck, who is regarded as the mini-ambassador for the town of Green Mountain Falls.
“General Roy” became a symbol of the Goose-gate fight in Green Mountain Falls, dealing with the age-old tradition of allowing kids and tourists to feed waterfowl at the lake area. For nearly two years, leaders/town officials and community residents argued over the best way to resolve the town’s ongoing goose quagmire.
Details are sketchy, but residents are up in arms. Unconfirmed reports indicate Roy, who can’t physically fly, may have been kidnapped, or may have gotten lost. Officials are denying that divisive politics played any role in the disappearance of Roy. In fact, some wonder if the scheduled city elections, slated for April 5, should be put on hold.
“All of our resources are being put into this case,” said Teller County Sheriff Mike Eminger. If this was a kidnapping, that person will be prosecuted to the full extent of the law, and even be forced to attend six consecutive staff meetings of The Mountain Jackpot (TMJ). That’s a punishment I wouldn’t inflict on anyone. That person better hope we don’t catch them.”
A coordinated search is being conducted between the sheriff’s office and Teller County Search and Rescue. Mike Smithey, a spokesman for the Teller Search and Rescue unit, says all political differences are being put aside for this special case.
“I may have had some differences with the sheriff over training budgets and other matters, but our focus is on finding Roy,” said Smithey.
The units have even assembled Charlie Chamers, a renowned outdoor expert, who specializes in tracking through the High Country in sandals. Chambers, who recently returned from a trip to the Alps, with renowned writer Jon Kraukauer, known for such outdoor adventure epics as “Into Thin Air” and “Into the Wild,” is optimistic about the group’s chances.
“Roy will be rescued,” said Chamers, who has ordered special drone devices to help with the pursuit.
A community-wide charity event has been organized to solicit extra funds for the search, organized by old foes GMF Mayor Lorrie Worthy and former trustee Macc Pirone. “Until we find Roy, I have agreed to not yell at a public meeting for two weeks and criticize the current board. Well, realistically, I will try for one week.”
Still, many in GMF are outraged.
“I have warned our city leaders that something like this was going to happen,” said Ann Pinneli, a caretaker of the geese and ducks at the lake in Green Mountain Falls. “There were too many delays in dealing with this goose situation at our lake. We submitted recommendations for months and they weren’t acted on.”
Pinneli was referring to new waterfowl feeding regulations, adopted by the board of trustees, that have forced wildlife experts to scratch their heads in interpreting their meaning.
“I guess we will experience another year of Goose-gage headlines in the Mountain Crackpot,” concluded a frustrated Dick Batton, a local trails guru and member of the GMF Parks advisory committee.The British Embassy, headed by the Ambassador H.E.

An additional thought.
Scrivener comes with two sets of guidance - an interactive tutorial and an instruction manual, both under the Help menu. I don’t recommend reading the manual from cover to cover, although some people do: it’s well-written but it’s several hundred pages long. Better to use it like an encyclopaedia for reference when you have a question about a specific topic. It’s reasonably well indexed.
I do strongly recommend focusing on the interactive tutorial, and working through that from start to finish before you write a syllable with the software. The Literature & Latte forum is as Paul Korm says very good, and extremely well-supported by the L&L team, but it’s noticeable that a proportion of the questions that regularly come up there could have been easily resolved by users if they’d gone through the tutorial (or spent five minutes trying to find answers to their questions in the Manual).Property Attributes

By night time of August 28, Gensei invited us to Coco Amigos. Jinno-sensei was there but Taki and the rest slept early. Nobu and some other Japanese Sillimanian students were there as well. Jinno-sensei was telling a lot of stories which interested us: from Japanese culture to the Japanese language, until he started talking about this Japanese paper and the activities they'll be doing in Siquijor. As we took off, Jinno-sensei invited us to be in their hotel the next day. He instructed us to bring some white shirts so that we can have it painted.
Jinno-sensei was actually making this streamer by the day we went their for the T-shirt painting. It was a streamer on Silliman University and Shikoku University's decade of friendship. He was just so proud about it that he wanted it hanged somewhere in the campus. Jinno-sensei asked Taki and the others to help us out with the painting. There were just a lot of colored paints. Gensei started asking us about our T-shirt designs and everyone wanted it to be Japanese characters. Gensei sought the Jap characters for SESI, REYNA, DENDEN, and GEORGE and RENE who were also there that day.
That day was caught on paper with these frozen moments.
Jinno-sensei painting the streamer.
Unwrapping the paints.
Planning out what to paint
Spreading the shirts.
Gensei actually wanted us to pick among Taki, Eisei, Kenta, Tetsuya, and Otsuka for the shirt painting. Jinno-sensei I think picked Otsuka for me. I really don't know who paints best among them.
Eisei was the one who painted Rene's shirt. From here, they're trying to layout the Japanese characters on the shirt. SE-SI - Jap-Chinese characters which means beautiful beach. Jinno-sensei picked the characters for me. There were a lot of Jap-Chinese characters equivalent to the syllables Se and Si. Sesi comes from my name Sesinando, and that's how they call me here in Dumaguete, even for Gensei and his friends.
By the time Otsuka made his first stroke, I asked Kenta and Gensei if Otsuka is good in painting. Kenta joked that Otsuka isn't. I learned later that he meant it right after I confirmed Gensei for the same question. Otsuka seemed hesitant when he brushed his first stroke. He almost messed it up, and we all went laughing when he retorted in Japanese. Haha.
Eisei begun his smooth strokes by then and finished the first syllable, RE for RE-NE.
More from Otsuka's masterpiece.
Tadan, first syllable done.
It's pronounced as SE.
A few minutes later, Otsuka finished earlier than Eisei. The shirt looked great and came up clean!
Thanks a lot Otsuka. You did great dude, hehe. Otsuka doesn't look like Japanese upclose, but he's pure.
Thanks a lot Otsuka. You did great dude, hehe. Otsuka doesn't look like Japanese upclose, but he's pure.
And there it is. RE-NE finished. As Eisei finished the shirt, Denden and Reyna decided to have Eisei paint another one for them. They said he was better than Otsuka and even Jinno-sensei which I think is quite true.
Rene and Eisei shot with the shirt.
Reyna and George's shirt are up next.
This time, it's Taki's turn to paint for Reyna's shirt.
Eisei, for the second time around, painted George's shirt with Kenta's assistance.
Taki started off with the first syllable. Otsuka is now on assist.
more pics.
The rest of the images are currently in Gensei's cam who is now in Japan. =P Reyna's bat which I was using emptied after the last shot.
Eisei again painted for Denden's shirt. Everything finished at 5pm.
Jinno-sensei invited us for that activity without charge. I can't even believe how Taki, Eisei, and Otsuka were so willing to do it. Jinno-sensei said that it was his gift for us for being friends with Gensei and the others. Wahaha, char.
Anyway, we appreciated it a lot. It was very fun and we got to know the Japs better.

Our Hitmen Pest Control Review
Founded in Napa, California, in 1978, Hitmen Termite & Pest Control offers a long history of pest control service. Their long history has aided in developing IPM (Integrated Pest Management) methods that focus on eliminating pests and keeping them gone for good.
Hitmen provides extermination services for a variety of common pests, rodents, termites, and hard to kill ones such as bed bugs and fleas. We also like that they offer lawn care services so that customers don’t have to contact multiple companies to meet all their pest management services.
Hitmen has mixed reviews on third-party review sites, with many reviewers finding their communication and scheduling lacking. However, with a 50 percent off initial service discount for new customers, we find this is a good deal for people who have never booked a pest control company before.
Overall Quality
Our Rating:
Reviews about Hitmen Termite & Pest Control’s reliability are mixed. However, it’s important to note that homes experiencing heavy infestations will need to expect repeat visits to eradicate any pests.
We like the fact that Hitmen offers free termite inspections as well as a discount for new customers. Hitmen also states that professionals will come back out for free for qualifying structures if homeowners notice that termites have returned in two to five years.
PRO
Wide variety of services for all pest control needs
CON
Customers aren’t happy with communication and scheduling
Features & Services Provided
Our Rating:
Hitmen Termite & Pest Control offers extermination services for the following common pests:
- Ants
- Bed Bugs
- Bees, wasps, and hornets
- Cockroaches
- Fleas
- Rodents
- Spiders
- Termites
Although Hitmen Termite & Pest Control can come by once for treatment, they also offer year-round protection and maintenance plans. These plans are best for homes with pest control issues that reemerge every year due to the changing seasons.
Ant Extermination
Hitmen’s ant extermination services apply to harvester ants, pharaoh ants, carpenter ants, and more. We like the fact that their website supplies identification tips and ways to reduce the chances of an ant infestation, and it does this for all of the pests they’re able to treat.
Bed Bug and Flea Extermination
Bed bugs, as well as fleas, are notoriously hard to eradicate. Hitmen provides extermination services for both of these common pests. These pests can also be hard to spot, so we like the fact that their website includes ways to quickly identify them so you can determine if you need professional help.
Termite Extermination
Hitmen offers eco-friendly extermination services for all kinds of termites, including dampwood termites, drywood termites, and western subterranean termites. Customers can receive a free inspection of their property to determine if they have an infestation and the invading termite.
After treatment, Hitmen may come back for ongoing treatment to ensure the termite infestation is gone. They also state that if termites come back within a two to five-year period, exterminators will come back at no charge for qualifying structures.
Rats and Mice
Hitmen is also able to provide rat and mice extermination for customers. The company explains that they use traps versus bait because rats and mice will run off after ingesting the toxic bait. Later on, they can die within the walls of your home. Trapping is a far more humane process and allows the professionals to eliminate them from your home.
Once all the rodents are trapped, Hitmen will provide exclusion repairs to eliminate any future entry points so that you don’t have the same problem again.
Additional Services
In addition to pest control, Hitmen also provides disinfecting services and tree, lawn, and shrub care.
Many companies in the pest control industry are now offering lawn care as another service offering, making sense. Plants and trees that aren’t taken care of can become prone to diseases and insects, leading to more pest control issues in your home.
Hitmen’s lawn care service also eliminates harborage areas where rodents and insects typically nest, breed, or increase.
As a response to uncertain times, Hitmen’s disinfecting services are perfect for commercial properties or families that want to stay safe. Specialists use advanced liquid dispersal technology that kills pathogens within 10 minutes on non-porous surfaces. Hitmen also provides a Certificate of Disinfection Service afterward to display to customers and increase their confidence in your business.
PRO
Variety of services for residential and commercial properties
They don’t offer wildlife control.
Hitmen Termite & Pest Control has overall mixed to average reviews across various third-party review sites. Although they have many five-star reviews on their website, we didn’t see this reflected on Yelp or Angie’s List.
Although many people find that the service technicians are courteous and knowledgeable, they may not arrive when they say they would. Communication with customers also doesn’t seem to be consistent.
Punctuality & Professionalism
Punctuality was one of the main issues people had on Yelp with Hitmen Termite & Pest Control. One reviewer noted that the company could improve communication between office staff and customers. Although time windows are provided for the technician’s arrival, some customers wait for hours afterward, while others don’t have an accurate time window.
Their serviceman is fabulous! However, no matter how many times we call the office and say we signed up for a 10:00 am – 12:00 pm appointment, the automated call ahead reads us an 8:00 am.
When we call back to correct, the office personnel say, “sorry, your spot is full.”
Pauline A. from Novato, CA via Yelp
Persistence
Customers seem to be happy with the effort that the technicians put in to solve their pest control issues. Technicians are well-trained and able to communicate their pest control knowledge with customers to educate them about preventative techniques.
We are fairly new customers and have been very pleased with the responsiveness of Heron. We have had a mealy bug problem off and on for several years and Heron has been prompt to address it and to come back for follow-up when needed.
Shirley M. W. via Hitmen’s Website
Effectiveness
Some negative reviews from Yelp customers come from people who don’t believe their rodent, cockroach, or spider abatement services are up to par. Technicians seem to cut corners when it comes to setting up traps for rodents. Customers also notice that after a treatment for pests, they see them coming back after a short while.
Although heavy infestations could require more than one treatment, customers feel frustrated because they don’t seem quick to resolve their disputes. They also don’t often reply to negative reviews; when they do, it’s through a default message that doesn’t address the customer’s concerns.
As a real estate broker, I’ve worked with Hitmen over the last two decades. I just want to say the quality of service has deteriorated considerably. From scheduling to the inspector just showing up an hour early and starting an inspection without confirmation and the poor overall customer service over the phone.
This is not the way to service an organization that has been loyal for as long as we have.
Joe H. from Windsor, CA via Yelp
PRO
Friendly, knowledgeable technicians
CON
Numerous negative reviews about lousy customer service and ineffective treatments
Cost
Our Rating:
Hitmen Termite & Pest Control doesn’t post their prices on their website. Interested customers will need to call the number provided to receive a quote, and they can also fill out their contact form for the company to call them later.
With reviews of subpar customer service, we find this method of discussing pricing prohibitive for new customers. Customers who also prefer to text or email will also find no accommodations.
Hitmen offers year-round pest control coverage. We find that prices vary depending on the services needed, square footage of the home, and infestation level.
Free Termite Inspection
Hitmen can inspect your home or property for free to determine if you have termites. This offer only applies to properties of 2,500 square feet or less.
Initial Pest Control Discount
For new customers that have purchased a maintenance plan, Hitmen offers 50% off the initial service.
PRO
New customers can enjoy a nice discount from initial services
CON
Customers need to call to receive a quote
Conclusion
Hitmen is most proud of its innovative treatment methods over 30 years. They are leaders in utilizing and developing the latest technologies for pest management.

By Arthur Davis ’19
For her Lang Opportunity Scholarship project over the summer, Ferial Berjawi ’19 designed and ran the BetterFly Camp, a six-week program that brought 30 young refugee girls in Lebanon together to discuss body image, legal rights, gender-based violence, and sexual and reproductive health.
The program, which Berjawi discussed with the Arabic news source FutureTV and on Journal Post, targeted Syrian and Palestinian refugee girls in Lebanon between ages 10 and 15. It emerged from Berjawi’s personal experiences and motives.
“I’ve always found myself surrounded by broken women who never received sufficient awareness to determine their own paths,” says the economics and peace & conflict studies special major from Beirut. “I developed the program to empower these girls to become the pioneers of change in their societies.”
Berjawi took a research-based approach to the program and used an array of innovative methods piloted by nongovernmental organizations (NGOs) like the Danish Refugee Council and the Women’s Refugee Commission. The Lang Center for Civic & Social Responsibility, which awarded Berjawi the scholarship, lauded her project as a great example of the impact that students can have around the world through engaged scholarship.
Back at Swarthmore this fall, Berjawi discussed her experiences with and vision for the BetterFly Camp.
How would you describe the work you did this summer with the BetterFly Camp?
Basically, it was a series of psychosocial support sessions that had to do with early marriage, gender-based violence, positive body image–also legal rights, discrimination, power, and positionality. It was just basically addressing the different layers of these girls’ identities and helping them start thinking about who they are and who they want to be in the future. All of them have witnessed [gender-based violence]. All of them have seen it, or might have experienced it. That’s not their fault. They’re not to blame. They’re only the victims, even though they are victims with a lot of agency. So we made sure we were not taking that agency away from them. They should be allowed to find their own agency, look within themselves, and find their own power to rise above social constraint and determine their own paths for the future. So it was more inspiration and empowerment than it was about knowledge.
How did the idea for the project originate?
I grew up with everything that is going on. Just growing up and seeing it, living under the patriarchy, I experienced the sexism, the misogyny, the objectification, the dehumanization of women all the time. So that was part of it. But I never really knew how bad it was until I did an internship with the Danish Refugee Council the summer after my sophomore year. There, I worked closely with the gender-based violence program coordinator [on a large-scale empowerment/education program]. So I thought, “How about I do a similar initiative, but with a different approach?” I thought it would be more effective so the girls could open us up to even more, since it was a smaller group.
What was the Lang Center’s role in the project?
I got the Lang Opportunity Scholarship in December of my sophomore year, and they basically funded my internship that summer with the Danish Refugee Council. I don’t think I would have been able to do it otherwise. They’ve been there, backing me up, all the way. My context is very particular to Lebanon, and even though it may not be their area of expertise, bridging our knowledge together, we were able to make it work.
Is there anything that news excerpts or blurbs tend to miss when describing the big picture of your project? Moments or details that get left out?
There are little victory moments when you’re like, “Yes! This is working!” The final celebration is one example of that. We had our sessions and at the end, I was like, “You know what, girls? Let’s have a final celebration where you present something.” I thought it’d just be an hour. They’d come, they’d get their certificates, and that’d be it. But they wanted to perform. So in a matter of three weeks, we were able to choreograph a dance—two dances, actually—and a play. The parents loved it. After the celebration, they came up to me thanking me for the project. And the girls—five of them were crying their eyes out, so I just started crying, too. It’s one of those moments that are very genuine and very real. I learned more from them than they learned from me, I think.
What are your future plans—for the project or yourself?
Someone actually reached out to me from an American NGO. The director learned about my work from social media, and they want to do another project cycle over winter break. They’re completely funding a new cycle, and I’m going to partner with them on it. And for the future, I’m looking into social impact consulting and nonprofit work. Last summer was super rewarding, but you can do all these interventions and do all this nonprofit work, but their lives will ultimately be shaped by the socioeconomic and political circumstances that they live in. So I want to be working on a more policy level to change the framework itself.The art and science of creating picture-perfect smiles is alive & well at Sensitive Care.

Nomination Year: 2004
SYNOPSIS: This movie is one of those strange ones where the movie itself is serious, but high campiness surrounds a single character. In almost every scene he's in, the black guy Jeff says something funny and you can tell he was a headliner in his day, a real Rochester type. It's about some guys flying over the Caribbean (near "Porta Reeka" on their way to the "Bahaymahs"). Lost and about to crash, they home in on a strange radio signal. They crash anyway, on a island run by the weird Dr. Sangre, who, of course, invites them to stay. Right away, zombies come out of the woodwork and menace the black guy. At first, his bosses don't believe him, but they eventually learn that the good Doctor is a Nazi spy feeding his German masters information which he extracts from his victims with the help of a voodoo priestess. The admiral he recently captured (victim of an earlier plane crash) has vital information but is a tough nut to crack, and with pressure mounting on him from his superiors, the Doc decides to transfer the soul of the man into his niece. But our square-jawed hero and his servant bust up their little ceremony and help stage a zombie rebellion. Yes, it's another Nazi zombie movie! Oh. And the bad guy is an evil hypnotist. Aren't they all?

And He Probably Could Have Done Without That Plane Crash, Too
Bill was injured in the plane crash back in the start of the movie (he was the only one -- he got a little gash on his forehead while the other two walked away without a scratch, even though the plane was nothing but a twisted heap of metal--but I digress). Early on, Dr. Sangre had warned everyone that people with even small wounds tend to die on the island, because of the exotic diseases hereabouts. Of course, that was just Sangre's way of setting up for Bill's later disappearance so he could make a zombie out of him. In the aftermath of the botched ceremony, with the Nazi spy-ring broken, the captives freed, and the zombies de-zombified, someone asks Mac how Bill is doing. He replies, with completely serious delivery that makes the line: "Well...those bullets didn't help him any."

There are many opportunites to catch Dr. Sangre (played by Henry Victor) utilizing his fake accent (at least I hope it's fake!) and slurring or flubbing his lines. You can almost take your pick of whatever scene he's in. In this one, there are visible pauses as he struggles to remember his next line, almost like his mind wandered and he had to recall that he was shooting a movie. At one point he mentions having been to the "Ba-hay-mahs." At another, he hopes his guests are "warm and comumfortable." Later, he mugs and tells Jeff that his butler "wont hurt you...[uh, what's my line now?] ... if he likes you."

On July 6, 2013, the crash of an Asiana Airlines flight landing in San Francisco killed three Chinese teenagers traveling to the U.S. to attend summer camp. The third victim, 16-year-old Ye Mengyuan, survived the flight but then was killed after being run over by a rescue vehicle on the tarmac. Initially a California prosecutor declared the death accidental as her body was covered by fire-fighting foam amid a chaotic scene. But new footage obtained by CBS News shows that other first responders warned fire trucks about her presence as they were driving near the scene. From the Guardian: shouts before the driver stops and opens his door to talk. “There’s a body right there, right in front of you,” the firefighter says. About 15 minutes later Ye was run over, CBS reported. [Source]Campus Security

The Luxe strapless from Curvy Kate goes up to a J cup across all band sizes and it’s amazingly supportive.As soon as I saw Curvy Kate’s Luxe Strapless bra previewed, I knew it was going to be a winner. I’ve been saying for years that vertical seams provide the strongest support and least strap-dependent shaping, and I couldn’t figure out why no one was using them in a strapless bra.

Block on Trump's Asylum Ban Upheld by Supreme Court
Batches of fat-burning supplement OxyElite Pro are likely going to be removed from shelves soon. The Hawaii Department of Health, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the Centers of Disease Control (CDC) are encouraging consumers to stop using the supplement, after several reports of hepatitis, liver-failure, and even one death may have been linked to the dietary supplement, the New York Daily News reports.
So far, 29 suspected cases have been under investigation. In 24 of those cases, more than 80%, symptom sufferers reported using OxyElite Pro. 11 consumers were also hospitalized, while two required liver transplants.
Possible Dangers of OxyElite Pro
OxyElite Pro is a weight loss and muscle building dietary supplement that is sold nationwide. According to a statement released from the company to the FDA, reports USA Today, they believe that counterfeit versions of the supplement are being marketed.
The company also claimed that the liver problems, "[are] complete mystery and nothing like this has ever been associated with OxyElite Pro."
However, just to be safe, domestic distribution has since ceased while the investigation carries on.
No Such Thing as "Fat-Burning"
The CDC, according to USA Today, is urging health-care providers, hospitals, and all other health agencies to be on the lookout for any patients who develop liver failure or acute hepatitis after using a weight-loss and/or a muscle building supplement.
An expert with the Cambridge Health Alliance in Massachusetts, according to USA Today, also added that the concept of a fat-burning pill is a myth. "The idea that there is a natural weight-loss pill out there is hogwash. Either the pills don't work or they do work because they contain substances which are not natural and are pharmaceuticals."
Dietary supplements, such as OxyElite Pro, don't actually have to be approved by the FDA before they are sold in stores. However, this doesn't mean that they aren't just as susceptible to being recalled as any other product.
While the FDA is investigating, they could not be reached for comment because of the ongoing government shutdown.

For the second year in a row, Appalachia High dashed Surry County's hopes of winning the Group A Division 1 football state championship. The Bulldogs edged the Cougars 24-21 Saturday on a chilly afternoon before about 2,000 fans at Smithfield High's stadium.
Surry (10-4) dominated the first half, scoring on back-to-back possessions to go ahead 13-0 and leading 21-16 at halftime. But Appalachia, a powerhouse program in Southwest Virginia, wore down the Cougars in the second half en route to its sixth state title.
Appalachia (13-1) beat a previously unbeaten Surry team 40-14 in the championship game last season. This time the Cougars were better prepared, but still didn't come out with their first state championship.
''The difference was we didn't move the ball effectively in the second half and they did,'' Surry coach Willie Gillus said. ''In a nutshell, that's what happened.''
Quarterback Shernard Newby, Surry's most gifted player, was magnificent.
The University of Virginia-bound Newby completed 15 of 24 passes, including his first seven, for 176 yards. He also was on the receiving end of several laterals and played defensive back, intercepting an Appalachia pass.
But the Bulldogs had more weapons, and different kinds.
The first was quarterback Travis Turner, who has committed to play for Virginia Tech next year. He rushed for 60 yards on 12 carries and directed an offense that amassed 295 yards rushing for the game.
And the Bulldogs had two capable backs.
Fullback Josh Fleenor, 5-foot-11 and 230 pounds, was a lumbering buzz saw of a runner. Teammate Travis Clark was more of a scatback, a slash-and-hop kind of player.
Clark accumulated 120 yards on 15 carries, while Fleenor ended up with 100 yards on 16 carries. Both were keys to Appalachia's wearing down of Surry in the second half.
''We knew where they were running and we made adjustments at halftime,'' Gillus said. ''Our kids were doing the best they could, but we just didn't stop them on the ground.''
Surry trailed 24-21 after Clark broke loose for a 42-yard touchdown run with 3:05 remaining in the third quarter. The Cougars had to punt on their next two possessions, but they held Appalachia on fourth-down situations on two Bulldogs drives.
Then Surry got the ball with 3:47 left in the game. Newby directed a drive from the Cougars' 25-yard line to the Appalachia 10, completing a 17-yard third-down pass to Jerron Birchette for a first down.
But Surry was penalized five yards for illegal motion, putting the Cougars at the 15 with three seconds left - time for one play.
The Cougars lined up with three receivers on the right, one receiver on the left and a lone setback. Newby's pass attempt to Sharone Bailey in the end zone was batted down by at least one Appalachia defender as time expired.
Surry's players and coaches were distraught after the game.
They huddled for a team discussion before moving toward their bus to stow their shoulder pads underneath and prepare for the ride home.
The Cougars were not willing to talk with the media. Most players wanted to be alone with their thoughts after coming so close to winning the biggest prize high school football has to offer.
Appalachia's fans and players lingered at midfield, soaking in the victory. Their eight-hour drive back home lay ahead, but it wouldn't seem nearly as long after a victory as it would after a loss.
''It came down to one play, could've gone either way, and you couldn't ask for a better finish for the fans,'' Travis Turner said. ''Their team was better than the one we played last year, and they had a little bit more speed than us. We just had to come out and play better in the second half.''
His father, Appalachia coach Tom Turner, said he thought both teams were equally talented and well-prepared.
''We usually throw a little more than we did today, but if we throw, we're not beating on them and we can't wear them down,'' Tom Turner said. ''We're used to running, and we just executed and did a good job. My fullback ran well.''
Trying to stop Fleenor all day would be enough to make anybody tired.
''He's hard to tackle in practice,'' Travis Turner said.Wing Hang Bank has stepped into the competition for mortgage loans by lowering its mortgage lending rate to 9.25 per cent.

It’s probably the question we get asked more than any other at SaleCycle, but it’s also one that all of us – as consumers – can relate to as well! So I decided to put together the 5 main reasons I would abandon a purchase online. And as you’re reading through, be honest with yourself, how many of them ring a bell?
1 High Shipping Costs
One of my biggest reasons for an abandonment is getting to the end of a shopping cart process, only to find out that it’s going to cost a significant amount more for shipping and handling. I’m always using price comparison tools so that I get the best deal, and if the shipping costs are too high, guess what? I’m going to look to purchase elsewhere.
There’s clearly a trade off here, as for smaller businesses shipping costs can remain high, but with many of the top online retailers offering free shipping at certain levels why not consider going for an up-sell? Set a value that makes sense for your business, be it $50, $100, $150 and be upfront about offering free shipping for orders over that level.
Staples.com for example go one step further and offer free shipping to anyone who is signed up as a rewards member (with no minimums!)… a great way to not only reduce abandonment, but encourage customer loyalty and repeat business.
2 Poor Customer Service
As mentioned above myself and millions of others who shop online want to ensure we are getting the best possible price available, after all we all love a good deal!
However, as much as I want to get the best price possible, I’m going to go with the company or brand that offers me the best service and is trusted online, even if the prices are matched or similar. For example a company who offers a no quibble returns guarantee, especially when buying clothes, helps remove the risk and makes me feel comfortable to purchase. Ultimately if it doesn’t work out I’m safe in the knowledge that I can get my money back or switch it out for something different.
I recently had a negative experience when purchasing from a well known retailer and when my items didn’t fit, I found I had to pay a restocking fee for the privilege of returning them. Needless to say, I haven’t purchased from that site again and don’t intend to in the near future.
It’s honestly about instilling confidence in your customers, which builds trust and sets businesses up for success.
3 A Complicated Checkout
Another pain point for me is a complicated checkout process. If it takes too long, there’s a lengthy sign up or I’m forever having to enter my payment details, then this is a sure fire way to not only prevent me from purchasing a first time but also from becoming a repeat customer.
4 Lack of Payment Options
This leads into the next question that online retailers should ask themselves, “Are we providing the customer with several payment options?”
At home, I often find myself misplacing things. It’s usually my wallet. This means when it comes time to purchase online I can’t locate my credit card to actually pay for the items in my cart.
Sometimes the resulting search ends in success, however if it is time consuming the purchase often gets forgotten about or left for another time.
But one sure fire way of getting me to complete my purchase is providing alternatives, such as PayPal or Google Wallet. Ultimately it’s all about convenience for the customer.
5 Just Window Shopping
From time to time, I will have a few moments to kill and will look around online, reading and keeping up with friends and family. But one thing that has crept into my online behavior now more than ever is browsing, or window shopping.
If I’m in the market for something (like a new pool cue or part for my bike), I find myself browsing multiple sites looking at the things I would like to own but don’t really have an intention of purchasing at that exact moment. I’ll add items to my cart, but that’s about it.
Sending a well-designed, timely remarketing email with the customers shopping cart details displayed and saved for later, is an extremely effective way of getting some of these hot leads back to your site to complete a purchase. One of my favorites is French Connection’s abandonment email. Not only is it design led but it’s short, to the point and focused on the brand:
With an average global abandonment rate of 76% not only are abandonment emails an effective tool to recover abandoned carts from those just window shopping, but applied correctly, they are shown to build brand loyalty and can be extremely effective in recovering abandoned sales throughout all of the reasons discussed.

clerks movieAs the Editor of a Men’s Lifestyle site grooming is an import an part of my daily activity, if i can in anyway make my life easier through new technology I will seek it out. I was recently introduced to Gillette’s new ProGlide technology through their new Ambassador Cricketer Steve Smith, and i have to admit I became an instant fan…
Following a successful summer test series and with the biggest tournament in One Day International Cricket just around the corner, champion Australian cricketer, Steve Smith has continued his hot streak, today unveiling a new video in partnership with Gillette in which he shows off the secret weapon he uses to maintain his game face.
The video sees Steve brandishing a new ‘bat’ – the Gillette Fusion ProGlide with FlexBall Technology razor – as he takes on the challenge of saying goodbye to ‘shave face’, those scrunching and stretching movements employed by men to ensure their razor makes contact with every inch of their face.
The new razor represents shaving rebuilt, with its unique FlexBall™ enabling the blade to pivot like never before, bringing another range of motion to shaving for better adherence to men’s facial contours, so they can get virtually every hair without moving an inch. Not only this; the razor features Gillette’s best blade cartridge technology to date – Fusion ProGlide, which joins with the new FlexBall technology to deliver Gillette’s best quality shave.
Steve Smith says: “I never realised that when I shave, I move my face to meet the razor, but pulling shave faces is something that every guy does – until now. I’ve loved working with Gillette to showcase the new Gillette Fusion ProGlide with FlexBall™ Technology razor, and let Aussie guys know they can now say goodbye to Shave Face for ever. This is a total game-changer!”
Engineered for a premium shaving experience, the rebuilt razor has transformed the way men will perform their regular shaving routine, using the FlexBall™ technology to maximise the comfort and closeness of the shave whilst navigating the difficult facial terrain.
Gillette Fusion ProGlide with FlexBall™ Technology is available from all large supermarkets and pharmacies nationally from February 16, 2015 from RRP $16.49.
#GoodbyeShaveFace Birthday to Me 🙂 Arrnott Olssen Editor Rogue HommeBy Maria Tracey Westlifes Kian Egan is preparing to take the plunge... at 10,000 feet.
The Sligo singer is set to swap the microphone for a parachute when he jumps out of plane next week in aid of the Strandhill Indonesian Relief Fund (SIRF).
The charity was set up by three Strandhill surfers, student Allan Mulrooney and brothers, Barry and David Mottershead, originally from Cape Town and who have been living in Strandhill for the past three years.
To date over ?9,000 has been raised for the fund, which will be used to help rebuild the Indonesian island of Java following the devastation left behind after last week’s tsunami.
And Kian’s parachute jump in Kildare next week, will help secure further funds for the cause.
“It’s great that Kian is prepared to jump out of a plane for the cause,” said 20 year-old Allan.
The Sligo star has also supplied a framed golden disc signed by all four Westlife members for the charity, which is expected to be auctioned on E-Bay in coming weeks.
And Westlife fans even came close to securing Kian to themselves for a few precious hours, when he initially offered himself for this Friday’s Surfers Man Auction in the Dunes Tavern, Strandhill at 9pm.
Unfortunately the Kian had to opt out of the event due to work commitments.
However, an impressive 20 surfers are still lined up for the auction, with an additional 20 on standby, if the demand for extra men prevails.
“We are going to auction off the lads for their trades, as we have two masseurs, a chiropractor and a web site designer among the guys lined up,” said Allan.
The victorious bidder will then secure the man of their choice for three hours on Sunday afternoon.
An Indonesian theme will be evident throughout the evening, as the marquee to the rear of the Dunes Tavern will be lined with palm trees and illuminated by colourful lighting. A cat walk will stand proudly in the centre of the marquee.
The event is hoped to increase awareness on the plight in Java, as last week the island was struck by the second natural disaster in the space of three months.
Initially the surfing trio had organised to work with the area effected by last May’s earthquake, however, last week’s tsunami has led them to change their plans.
“This is a new tragedy on the same island,” said Allan.
“As the earthquake effected area has a substantial amount of aid being pumped into it, we have decided to concentrate on the tsunami effected town of Pandangaran instead,” said Allan.
Due to corruption in Indonesia, Barry, Allan and David will travel out to Java on August 20, to provide people with the items they need to help rebuild their livelihood.
“We decided that we couldn’t go out with ?15,000 and just hand it out,” said Allan.
“So we were in contact with friends and they got us in contact with the charity IDEP, who will offer us advise and a four-by-four so we are not going in completely blind.”
Other events planned by the SIRF include the auctioning of World Championship-winning Mark Richard’s surfboard donated by Matt Britton of Surfers Village.
“This is fantastic of Matt to donate this and it really is hard to tell what an item like this will fetch,” added Allan.
The board will be auctioned off on the SIRF website, with the highest bid received by August 15 claiming it as their own.
Also a screening of last week’s paddle race will take place tomorrow night at the Strand Bar at 8.30pm.
The race saw 13-year old Aaron Reid beat off strong competition to take first place, paddling six kilometres across Sligo Bay in just under two hours.
Copies will be for sale on the evening for ?10 for paddlers and ?15 to the general public.
Those wishing to sponsor the project can contact Allan at 087 6532209 or Barry at 086 1999015 or log on to.DELTA ISSUES: Delta pumping process may spur lawsuit Contra Costa Times 3/8/06 By Mike Taugher, staff writer California's largest water delivery system lacks the most basic permits required by the state's endangered species protection law, an association of anglers charged Tuesday in a formal lawsuit threat. The notice of intent to sue the state Department of Water Resources comes as the population of one fish protected under the law, the Delta smelt, is severely depressed and other fish populations throughout the Delta also are plummeting. At issue is whether the department's State Water Project, which delivers water from the Delta to more than 20 million people from Alameda County to Southern California, complies with the California Endangered Species Act. "They have just fundamentally blown off CESA," said Bill Jennings, executive director of the California Sportfishing Protection Alliance, which filed the notice. The threat is the latest sign that a decade of relative calm in California water policy could be giving way to a more bare-knuckled approach. "I think those days (of cooperation) are over," Jennings said. Environmentalists, anglers and others blame the state-owned pumps in Byron and smaller pumps owned by the federal government in Tracy for an ongoing decline among Delta fish species. The decline appears to have dramatically worsened in recent years. Scientists are still trying to determine the cause but say the pumps could be a contributor. The fact that the State Water Project has no permits or other formal documentation required by the state endangered species law was first determined last August by a state Senate committee. The Senate Natural Resources and Water Committee's inquiry was prompted by a report in the Contra Costa Times that showed on two occasions last year that biologists were overruled when they recommended temporarily curtailing pumping to protect the smelt. On Tuesday, DWR deputy director Jerry Johns said that although the State Water Project does not have formal state-issued permits, a series of other documents give it a "patchwork" of compliance. "We think we are in compliance," Johns said. "We have a federal (document with a permit) and we meet once a week with biologists, including the state biologists, to make changes for Delta smelt." The documents in that patchwork include a 1986 agreement designed to offset losses of striped bass, salmon and steelhead at the pumps and a 1995 amendment that Johns said expanded the earlier agreement to include Delta smelt and other fish species. The documents do not make it clear that they are meant to serve as compliance for the state endangered species law. Terry Erlewine, general manager of the State Water Contractors, which represents water agencies that take water from the project, also said those earlier documents mean the state water department is complying with the law. Nevertheless, the Department of Water Resources and the Department of Fish and Game are attempting to develop a new species conservation plan authorized under the state law. Although the State Water Project has similar permits from federal agencies, Jennings and lawyer Michael Lozeau said the state law is more stringent. Jennings and Lozeau said this is because the federal law requires state water managers to simply develop reasonable alternatives that prevent jeopardizing the existence of fish species. The state law, they said, requires the state to fully "mitigate," or offset, the losses of fish. "That means the species is not any worse off after the project than before," Lozeau said. "We're seeing this blatant violation by DWR because they don't want to hear what Fish and Game has to say about full mitigation. We think that will have very substantial (protections) for these fish." Johns said the state law would require the department to fully offset the loss of fish only to the extent that it affects the overall population, he said. And, he said, it is difficult to tell whether the state pumps are affecting population levels. The sportfishing organization's notice said that it intends to sue after 30 days, but added it is willing to discuss a way to settle the case first. # Anglers say they may sue; Group wants protection for fish dying at pumps Stockton Record 3/8/06 By Warren Lutz, staff writer STOCKTON - A sportfishing association says it will sue state water officials if they don't prevent the loss of endangered and threatened fish species at pumps that deliver water to 23 million Californians. The Department of Water Resources is violating state law, because it never got the permits required to take the thousands of Delta smelt and chinook salmon that die at the pumps near Tracy every year, the California Sportfishing Protection Alliance said Tuesday. "The (department) and the Department of Fish and Game have essentially ignored the requirements of the California Endangered Species Act," said Bill Jennings, the group's chairman. The plight of the smelt and other plummeting fish populations in the Delta is of increasing concern to environmentalists, anglers, scientists and politicians. The tiny, translucent, blue fish, seen as an indicator of the entire Delta estuary's health, are listed as threatened under the federal and state endangered species acts. Early results from a California Fish and Game trawl survey show that their population is at its lowest level since the surveys began in 1967. Department of Water Resources Deputy Director Jerry Johns acknowledged the state never applied for the so-called incidental take permits that allow the killing of fish at the pumps. Last year, a team of scientists identified exports that deliver water to homes and farms south of the Delta as a possible cause for the smelt's decline. Environmentalists blame higher water deliveries from the Delta during the winter for taking an unexpectedly high toll on Delta fish. But agreements with the Department of Fish and Game allow the pumping arrangement to continue without violating state law, Johns said. "From a legal standpoint, we're covered under both the federal Endangered Species Act and the state Endangered Species Act," Johns said. "But evidently, someone doesn't think that." Jennings said such agreements don't hold water. "Unfortunately, a wink and a back-room handshake doesn't comply with the statutory requirements of the (state law)," he said. A Department of Fish and Game spokesman referred questions regarding the controversy to the Department of Water Resources. The California Sportfishing Protection Alliance said it will sue to enforce state law if the state does not comply within 30 days. The state's failure to get permits for fish lost at the pumps emerged last year during a California Senate Committee on Natural Resources and Water hearing. At the hearing, committee Chairman Michael Machado, D-Linden, said he found the arrangement between the Department of Water Resources and the Department of Fish and Game troublesome, despite the "patchwork of agreements" the two agencies had with each other. Machado said he believes that water exports have been a factor in the decline of several Delta fish species, including the smelt, and that the state should have obtained permits. "If you had incidental take permits, you would have benchmarks where you would monitor the activities of the pumping," Machado said. "That may have very well led to alterations in the way that system was run." In response to a public-records request in December, the Department of Water Resources told a California Sportfishing Protection Alliance attorney it had no record of applying for an incidental take permit, nor did it have any documents showing that the pumps' effects on fish were consistent with the state's Endangered Species Act. "All indications are they never bothered to comply with the statute," said Mike Lozeau, a California Sportfishing Protection Alliance attorney. # -------------- next part -------------- An HTML attachment was scrubbed...

I have a back-end server that is making a post call to my API Gateway with a body, using the following header:
Content-Type: multipart/related;type="text/xml";start="part0";boundary="--------uuid:e4b3c9ca-ef03-6ddb-c27f-b4e7708d6cc2"

What's even more intriguing is that the request message does not even get logged in the gateway. Instead I get the following message:

Not sure what is happening, but it seems that the Gateway does not like this header and is rejecting it before it can even route the message.
From the conclusion of the case, the end closing tag for the multi-part related needed to have two hyphens in terminating boundary as the gateway was not able to determine the end of the payload with only one hyphen.

It might help if you read the article first, but it’s certainly not necessary.
Uncovering Unknown Issues of the Heart
I think this is one of those seriously painful issues every Christian entertains when the bottom of their world drops out. And I am a painfully average Christian! My answer to Melanie’s question follows; although I’ve edited it, pluralized it, corrected misspelled words, etc., and as any true writer is prone to do, added to and reworded parts of it:
Yes, I still struggle with feeling God’s love for me as opposed to just believing He loves me. I am no longer desperate to feel His love – some of that is due to pharmaceutical help and some of it’s due to the inability to maintain that kind of emotional energy over an extended period of time. But, yes, I still struggle to feel God’s love. However, my perspective has changed a bit in the last few months.
Just as I love my husband and daughter, I realize that I don’t always feel a rush of love for them every time I see them. And as you no doubt have experienced yourself with your own families, sometimes how I do feel is less than loving. Life happens. Petty frustrations and unmet expectations result in less than loving feelings, but when their safety is threatened, or someone harms them emotionally, my response is clearly indicative of intense and passionate love for them.
There are times you tell your children “no” and they just can’t understand why. Somehow, this child that you labored over, nursed and nourished, clothed and nurtured, still doubts that you have their best interest at heart. Instead they think you don’t trust them or don’t want them to have fun. Their minds are so clouded by what they want that they can’t comprehend a reasonable and logical argument explaining the reasoning behind your response. In most instances, the conversation deteriorates from that point on as anger and attitude surface. I, then, find myself frustrated and sometimes resentful for being perceived as the bad guy. Parenting is hard.
As embarrassing as this is to admit, I think I respond the exact same way my children do when God says no or closes a door — not that His response to my reaction is frustration and resentment. But honestly, just like my children, I want what I want when I want it, how I want it, and I don’t want anyone telling me that what I want isn’t best for me.
Just the other day I asked myself exactly what I expect God to do to make me “feel” His love?
I can’t make my husband feel happy or sad or loved at will. I can try but some days, for whatever reason, the things that normally make him laugh or feel loved just don’t result in the usual emotional response. Emotions are a response to some stimuli. It’s pretty unreasonable of me to demand that God provide that stimuli on demand, but isn’t that what I’ve been trying to do? Even if He did, some days it just wouldn’t work. I’d be too distracted, afraid, or whatever for that stimuli to generate the hoped for response. C.S. Lewis said in A Grief Observed, .” Could it be that in my desperation to “feel” God’s love, I can’t quiet myself enough to hear His still small voice?
I think I’m starting to understand that the only thing I can do is ask God to help me recognize and experience His love for me. I can ask God to help me not only accept His love, like a gift wrapped package, and to receive it by opening the gift, but also to open my heart so I value the gift as it was intended. And that last point is critical. Have you ever received a gift and been disappointed because it wasn’t what you hoped for or maybe you wondered, “What am I supposed to do with this?” In order to grasp God’s love and care I need to be able to comprehend and fully appreciate the value of the gift given. Sometimes it’s only in retrospect that we understand and appreciate a gift.
If I can’t learn to recognize God’s loving overtures or become increasingly confident His love for me regardless of how I feel, I can imagine only two possible ways God might satisfy my demand to make me feel His love. One, I can surrender myself to become a robot in His hand, which He never wanted, hence the gift/curse of free will, or two, I can require God to answer to me (which is absurd but bear with me a minute). This is how that idea might play out: Janet needs to feel love, therefore God needs to give Janet ‘xyz’ or ‘abc’ to stimulate the feeling of love she “needs” to feel. In this way, I, Janet, the creation am dictating to my creator, God, how to satisfy me. It’s not only presumptuous but you can fast forward to the logical conclusion that all God would succeed in doing is creating a spoiled, entitled and demanding child who felt no love for Him in return because a demand/fulfillment or demand/resentment cycle would have quickly been established. An entirely unsatisfying relationship, I dare say, based solely upon manipulation.
There’s a dynamic in a relationship with an unseen God that simply doesn’t exist in any other relationship I’ve ever been part of. That dynamic is, of course, the fact that I can’t see or touch God Almighty. My relationship with Him requires far more faith and trust than any earthly relationship I will ever have. To put that in perspective allow me to use a human relationship to make a point.
I’ve been married to my husband, David, for twenty-eight years. I see, touch and speak to him every day. I love my husband and I know he loves me. Even so, relationships ebb and flow. There are periods of time in which we are emotionally closer than others. In the twenty-eight years we’ve been married have I ever doubted my husbands love for me? Yes; more than once in fact. If I can see, touch and speak to this man every day and still manage to suffer through periods of time where I can’t feel his love for me, in spite of the fact that he is a good man with a servant’s heart, why should I be surprised that I can’t always feel God’s love for me? Why should I expect to feel God’s love for me all the time?
I guess I’m concluding that I need to humble myself and ask Him to help me experience the love I know, without a doubt, He has for me. I also need His help receiving His love because there is no earthly relationship that truly offers completely unconditional love and acceptance. I have experienced my parents and husband’s attempts to love me unconditionally, however, their example, will always fall short. We’re human, we all have expectations and unfortunately those expectations color our interaction with others either through spoken word or subtle body language, attitudes and actions. Only God offers unconditional love.
I need to realize that all my earthly experience with love has been flawed. I don’t have a pure worldly example of what true unconditional love looks like. So how can I possibly compare the way I perceive God’s love for me and decide if it measures up? Personal experience has taught me that at some point, in some way, love will let me down. Unfortunately, I think life has taught me to expect that God will let me down too, and sometimes my circumstances seem to scream that He has. It’s not true but people see what they expect to see, myself included. And perception and reality are often two very different things. The problem is that we can’t always recognize the difference.
Christians encounter so many different situations but regardless of the specific stressor many of the same emotional responses are generated and our response to those emotions is complicated by our faith and trying to lean on and trust God while simultaneously dealing with feelings of abandonment and betrayal or as if in the grand scheme of things His plans supersede our individual value to Him. It often feels as if we are but pawns in the pursuit of the lost, and that the wounds we suffer along the way are somehow acceptable, unintended consequences. I think we feel that way because that’s what we actually see played out before our eyes in the world around us – it’s how humans act, but not how God acts. I swear the hardest part of grieving is trying to reconcile my real world experience with God because He is holy and we have no visible representation of what holy really looks like when played out on the world’s stage.
This I do know because the Bible says it’s true, we are not expendable or deemed more or less valuable than any other Saint or sinner in God’s eyes. He does not operate on the philosophy that the ends justify the means. The Bible clearly states that God is love – everything about who He is and how He works is the living embodiment of love.
1 Corinthians 13 tells us exactly what that looks like. You can substitute “God” or a personal pronoun for love in those verses and it reads something like this: God is patient and kind. He is not proud, rude or self-serving. He is not easily angered. He does not delight in evil [as the wicked do]. God always protects, trusts, hopes, and perseveres. God never fails.
Since we only see glimpses of God’s innate character (displayed through lives being transformed (sanctified) by the Holy Spirit in fellow believers) and never see a fully sanctified believer we are tempted to believe that God behaves like humans do. It is a struggle to see Him filtered through the words on the pages of our Bibles. But even as Satan whispers his lies, your fear-filled heart is wrestling to cling to your faith in spite of, and also because of your circumstances, and you, like everyone else, become all too aware of your brokenness, exhaustion and most of all your absolute ineptitude. It’s frustrating, horrifying, discouraging and frightening and we all end up doubting and questioning because God made us insufficient in our own power. All those feeling are magnified by the knowledge that His ways are not our ways and that sometimes He allows the absolute unacceptable in our lives and we are terrified of that possibility — especially if we’ve experienced it in the past.
Ultimately, it’s clear that my desperate desire to feel God’s love on demand was in fact an unrealistic expectation. God’s plan is best. I don’t want to be a robot and He doesn’t want to control me. He wants me to choose to love Him just as He choose to love me. I want a mature love relationship with Him not the relationship of a temperamental toddler and an adult. In moments of desperation, I need to quiet myself, or in the event that I can’t manage that in my own efforts, allow God to quiet me, so that I can actually hear His voice speaking to me, reassuring me of not only His presence, but of His unfailing love as well. I also need to remind myself that just as my human emotions for others ebb and flow, my ability to feel God’s love will do the same. It’s not reasonable to expect to feel that heady kind of infatuation for or from God every moment of every day.
Furthermore, I must remember that because I have no plainly visible example of pure unconditional love, only God’s Word and the Holy Spirit can help me recognize and comprehend the reality of His unfailing love. God does not love me like anyone else loves me. He loves me better than anyone else has ever loved me and ever will love me. And yes, because I can’t see and touch God here on earth, I have to discipline myself to trust that what His word says is true, that He does love me with an everlasting love. Love is commitment and love is also an emotional response to stimuli. When I can’t feel that emotional response I have to have faith that God’s commitment to love me will not fail me.Early vintage Serengeti 6249 G sunglasses feature a rare purple frame and Serengeti Vermillion 7000SS double gradient mirror lenses made by Corning Optics.

Q&A with 'Plume Lifestyle'
-So, tell me a little bit about your team and where you are located.
Plume Lifestyle is located in Rugby, Warwickshire.
The team consists of family and friends.
My dad helped me make and design the website, my mum helps me with the beauty and health tips, my younger sister helped with the name and designed the feather logo, my ever patient partner who drives me around searching out ideas for stock and posting orders and my best friend for putting my website on the back of her handmade cards that she's letting me stock.
Though technically it is just me who runs the website I couldn't have done any of this without help!
-How did you get started?
I got started after a conversation I had with my partner about what I wanted be 'when I grow up' I absolutely love working in retail I love talking and interacting with new people everyday. So I decided I wanted to run my own shop. I thought about what I could stock, and came to the conclusion that I should stock things I love. I love being able to pamper myself and have a nice home with cute knickknacks so that was decided!
-What makes 'Plume Lifestyle' different from everyone else?
I'm proud to say I have yet to find a website that offers all that Plume Lifestyle offers.
It's different not because of what I stock but it's what I offer. With my health tips and beauty tricks section, YouTube videos and a link to my Twitter page I offer a person behind the website.
-What are your influences?
My influences are anyone who does what they love. I've worked for a locally run business who stocked similar things to my website, seeing this woman make her own businesses based on things she loved, being able to turn up to work and be happy!
-What are your strengths and weaknesses?
My weaknesses are, wanting to keep all the stock to myself! I have been very restraint actually so am very proud of myself for that. My strengths are my determined mind, once I am set on doing something I will do everything I can to make it happen and succeed.
-What's the best advice you've ever received?
"Try smiling, you look prettier" .
-What do you hope to have achieved in the industry, 10 years from now?
I hope to have achieved enough success to move back down to the South, and
open up my own shop stocking what I do now and more, maybe with a little
coffee shop at the back. ^_^
Thanks to Kirst for all her help. She's lovely and the products are so reasonably priced. Everything you need from one site.

Compute 2: 2 Core, 6gb ram
I can only launch two m1.small flavored instance in compute 1, and four m1.medium in compute 2. I can't launch more spec than that. and i also can't launch instance with higher flavor after i removed those instances. If i'm not mistaken, vcpu and ram default allocation is 16:1 and 1.5:1. I would like to launch an instance that use the maximum resource. at least 6 core, 10gb ram (the higher the better). Can anyone guide me on this?
Good day everyone,
Im new to openstack. i looked tutorial on installing openstack (packstack) and connect the instance with internet following tutorials here: (...)
I've setup openstack using 1 controller node [2cpu,6gb ram, 100+ gb space] and 2 compute node [4cpu, 8gb ram, 1Tb space][2cpu,6gb ram, 271gb space]. #my controller node does not include as compute node.
My problem is i can't launch an instance with specs higher than 4 vcpu, 4 gb ram, 80gb disk. I want to setup a single instance that combine both my compute nodes with specs of 8vcpu,10gb ram, 1tb space.
However, i can launch two instance with specs of 4 vcpu, 4 gb ram, 80gb (feels weird) but not a single 8vcpu,10gb ram, 1tb space instance. (with error code 500)
Can anyone help me on this?

KGI Securities analyst Ming-Chi Kuo has some predications about next year’s iPhone lineup. Kuo claims we’ll see three new iPhones next year, with a 5.8-inch OLED like the current iPhone X, a 6.5-inch OLED as a kind of iPhone X Plus. Sitting between them will be a 6.1-inch LCD version, with all models expected to feature Face ID and its TrueDepth camera system.
With the introduction of the front-facing TrueDepth camera system in the iPhone X, rumour has it Apple is now investigating the possibility of a rear-facing depth camera system for next year’s iPhone. Bloomberg says the laser camera system would allow iPhones to create a three-dimensional rendering of the environment, potentially enabling more immersive AR experiences, as well as cool depth effects for devices without dual cameras.
The first HomePod hasn’t even been released to the public, but already we’re hearing rumours about future models including Face ID. I’m not entirely sure how this will work, given that you’ll rarely want to be walking up to your wireless speaker to do things, but maybe Apple will make it work.
MacRumors reports iOS 11.2 will introduce faster wireless charging. Apple has been saying ever since it launched the iPhone 8, 8 Plus, and X with wireless charging that it would release a software update to enable 7.5W wireless charging via the Qi standard, and it looks like iOS 11.2 is that update. Although 7.5W is only 50% faster than the current 5W wireless charging speed, although it’s nowhere near the 15W supported by Qi 1.2 standard.

Cardiogram collected data from 600 participants over a period of time, with their analysis capable of detecting sleep apnoea with 90% accuracy, and hypertension with 82% accuracy. While the final diagnosis would be done with more professional equipment, that’s not bad for a fashion accessory.
AppleInsider have put the OLED display on the iPhone X to the test with their dark mode battery test. Due to the way OLED screens work, black means pixels are turned off completely, requiring no power at all — and if you pair that with the built-in smart invert colours, you’ll get much more battery life.
Some iPhone X owners are experiencing cracking or buzzing sounds from the earpiece. There doesn’t seem to be any link between the sounds, but it seems to happen whenever audio of any kind is played, especially at higher volumes.
The Mac Observer has a two-part series that first covers iCloud Content Caching, introduced as a feature in macOS High Sierra. It’s essentially the old software update cache that was included in previous releases of OS X Server, and you can fine-tune the content caching to determine what content gets cached on your Mac for faster download to your iOS device.
In case you missed it, Apple now allows Apple IDs created with third-party email addresses to be moved to an Apple email address — one of either @icloud.com, @me.com, or even @mac.com. MacRumors says this feature doesn’t appear to be available to all users just yet, so it’s possible this is a staggered rollout.
The best thing about Face ID, as pointed out by TidBits, is that it’s continuous authentication. By merely looking at your iPhone X, you’re authenticated. There’s no “resting your finger on a fingerprint sensor”, or passcode-entering, or whatever else. Just a look.
A giant phablet. O joy. Not. I wish that Apple would update the SE … I’ve missed the boat locally for buying the current model, clearly its been very popular at the lower (sub $400) pricepoint and it sure would suit my little pension and my little hand a lot better than the 6S. Update the SE, yes.
Can confirm, am unloved by Apple.

(the bourbon people) is locked in trademark combat with Tequila Cuervo La Rojena SA de CV (the tequila folks).
Recapping briefly, for the benefit of those whose interest in this matter may have resulted in over-indulgence in one or more of the subject products, the bourbon people have long objected to the use of an image of a crow on bottles of Jose Cuervo Tradicional tequila. In 1997, the parties entered into a settlement agreement whereunder use of a crow image by the tequila folks was restricted. For reasons yet to be explained, the tequila folks have, for some time, been exceeding the scope of use allowed them under the agreement. The bourbon people maintained that this constituted a breach of the settlement agreement and filed suit. The tequila folks did not actually deny the allegations of the bourbon people, but argued that “even if” they had “occasionally” exceeded the settlement’s restrictions, such was of a “minor, not a material, breach” and that the bourbon people had not lost any sales as a result of this “purported” breach.
This argument was given short shrift by a trial court, which held that “even a minor breach allows the innocent party some measure of damages to put it in the same position that it would have been in if no breach had occurred.” The tequila folks, perhaps acting under the influence of their product, chose to appeal this decision.
Well readers, the appellate court has just AFFIRMED the lower court’s decision. That, in itself, is not noteworthy. What is worthy of comment is the disclosure that the “purported,” “minor” breach involved five million bottles of Tradicional tequila, which yielded over $100 million in sales. A hundred million dollars is considered “major” where I come from. We’re now waiting to see what damages are assessed by the court.Index

Title: Computational Homology and Materials Science
Abstract:
Finding relationship between structure and property is one of the essential subjects in materials science. However, it is still difficult to notice what is the structural motifs or hierarchical information characterizing complex systems. Computational homology based on “persistent homology” [1] is a powerful framework to detect and describe the "shape" in discrete data such as atomic configurations or pixel images. The obtained geometrical information is contracted as a two-dimensional map called “persistence diagram (PD)”, in which birth and death of N-dimensional holes are recorded.
From the view point of materials science, the advantage of this mathematical method is summarized as follows:
(1) Detecting hidden order in the system.
(2) Providing “finger prints (or descriptors)” of complex systems.
(3) Enabling us to treat “inverse problems”.
In this talk, I will introduce the key points of computational homology for materials scientists. After that, we will see how it works in the analysis of molecular dynamics simulations and experimentally observed images, respectively.

What are the most popular flavors of yogurt?
The top five yogurt flavors are strawberry blend, vanilla, plain, strawberry and peach, according to a recent report from Dairy Management Inc., Rosemont, Ill., prepared by Chicago-based IRI. But something new and very unique to yogurt is starting to show up — savory flavors. Dairy Foods columnist Phillip Tong, Professor of Dairy Science at the Dairy Products Technology Center, first mentioned the new trend in our magazine back in February (see more on that article here). He mentioned that flavors like tomato, sweet potato, parsnip, ginger, curry and green tea are making their way into the yogurt aisle.
“Purees of these vegetables add sweetness and fiber along with unique savory flavor profiles,” said Tong.
This month, we reported on a yogurt line from Blue Hill, New York, N.Y., that consists entirely of savory flavors, like butternut squash, tomato, carrot and parsnip. Read more about this dairy product here.
Another trend showing up in yogurt products is an increase in seasonal flavors like apple, pumpkin and cranberry. Noosa is set to launch a cranberry apple flavor in its Aussie-style yogurt in July, while its popular pumpkin flavor is also returning. Chobani launched watermelon and plum in its seasonal, limited-batch line for summer.
As Tong mentioned, these new dairy flavors and other flavor introductions inspired by Hispanic and Asian cuisines are likely appeal to millennials.
Hispanic and Asian flavors are popular in milk and dairy products
Tapping into Hispanic and Asian flavors is not a new thing here in the United States, as Dairy Foods Columnist Kim Decker reported in our May issue, but interest is growing.
In Decker’s article (U.S. consumers welcome ethnic flavors) flavor expert Azeem Mateen (citing Mintel data) noted that 74% of U.S. households have either prepared or cooked ethnic foods at home and 59% eat ethnic foods because they like to try new flavors.
That is a sure sign that “as consumers’ palates demand more complex and intense flavors, we’ll continue to see ethnic flavors push the envelope in terms of culinary inspirations and eventually products on the shelf,” said Mateen, the marketing manager of sweet flavors for Sensient Flavors, Hoffman Estates, Ill.
But there’s still work to do in the dairy category. In Decker’s article, Anton Angelich, group vice president of marketing for Virginia Dare, said, “The mainstreaming of emerging international flavors within the dairy category will be a gradual process.”
Though mass media and social media can heighten consumers’ awareness of new and unknown foods, “it really takes the actual trial of cooking and tasting for something to catch on,” he said.
Mateen also said, that Greek-style yogurt is “a perfect vehicle” for ethnic flavors, pointing to savory Greek yogurt dips that have gone “beyond traditional flavors and are compelling ethnic fusions.”
Read more from Decker’s article on ethnic flavors here.
Unique flavor combos, seasonal flavors are trends in ice cream
As we head into July, which is National Ice Cream Month, ice cream manufacturers are showcasing some of their most out-of-the box ice cream flavors yet. The ethnic and culinary influences are on full display.
Like with Tillamook, Tillamook, Ore., and its new Cinnamon Horchata and Salted Butterscotch flavors. Oakland, Calif.-based Häagen-Dazs has a new Artisan ice cream collection that features flavors like Tres Leches Brigadeiro (a decadent sauce and swirl blended into tres leches ice cream); Applewood Smoked Caramel Almond (swirls of smoked Applewood caramel sauce combined with roasted, salted almonds in a sweet cream ice cream); and Chocolate Caramelized Oat (chocolate caramelized oat clusters, blended into caramel ice cream).
As we reported in our March issue, seasonal flavors and inclusions are also taking center stage.
Hudsonville Creamery & Ice Cream Co., Holland, Mich. features many unique flavors and inclusions in its year-round offerings, like Candy Bar Whirl (with candy bar pieces and caramel), Caramel Deer Traxx (includes caramel-filled chocolate cups) and Sea Side Caramel (which includes caramel sea salt truffles.)
Though certainly not new, seasonal and limited-edition flavors are growing among many brands. Processors use this method to test out new flavors or to generate excitement that ties into a specific season.
Hudsonville makes seasonal and limited-time flavors really work to its advantage. It offers a variety of limited-edition flavors throughout the year. Many which are inspired by the change of the seasons, while others feature flavors developed in exclusive partnership with prominent organizations, such as Grand Hotel of Mackinac Island (Grand Hotel Pecan Ball), the Detroit Tigers MLB Baseball Club (Tiger Traxx) and the Chicago Bears NFL Football Club (Bear Traxx).

Microsoft press conference
(Those awkward guys that keep their ties on at parties and one slightly overweight man wears an old t shirt under his smart blazer.)
- The XBOX One S is announced, it’s basically 40% smaller(pretty great) looks more like a sexy PC and runs 4k gaming, also has way bigger hard drive.
- Play anywhere, in short this catchy line means play cross platform between PC and Xbox, only buy your game once, not on steam though. L
- ReCore, more details released, it’s you and your robot dog, puzzles and(unfortunately) shooting mechanics, looks uninspired.
- Inside,(the new game from Limbo developers) it’s coming June 29th.
- There is a new custom controller design thing, so many colour combinations! Much wow!(Xbox Design Lab)
- Dead Rising 4, it looks to be the usual insanity, Frank West is back and the zombie murdering looks better than ever.
- State of Decay 2, well the first one was a very well realized and executed idea. It’s from an indie studio and this is a good thing.
- Xbox One : Project Scorpio, sounds silly, but then again don’t they always? Basically a pitch video of a load of people(industry veterans and xbox suits) gushing over the delicious graphical powerhouse that is the next step in Microsoft console generation. Don’t forget “nobody gets left behind” as the console will be backwards compatible with Xbox One and One S.
- Gears of War 4, yep it’s still brown(I mean SO brown), it has better particle physics and weather looks pretty good. It comes out October 11th 2016.
- Not forgetting Sea of Thieves, it’s from Rare, it’s 1st person, the graphics look pretty, it seems you have to work together with your friends to keep your boat doing its thing on the high seas. Very interesting and I bet it’s been a blast to work on.
Sony press conference
(Sure they like to party, occasionally completely out of left field they do a really ambitious creative project, they are more competitive than they like to show and in the end have their go to thing they always do)
- God of War PS4, what can be said here? I mean it was expected but they have given it a very different more serious tone(as serious as you can make it anyway) different art style, different voices etc. Definite inspiration from both Last of Us and new Tomb Raider titles.
- Death Stranding … Naked upset looking Norman Reedus, a baby, handprints, dead crabs … yep it’s Hideo Kojima and his new game everyone.
- The Last Guardian, small trailer and as per usual it looks so flipping great. An actual release date this time, 25th of October 2016.
- Horizon: Zero Dawn, the gameplay demo showed a bigger breadth of robot animals, your interactions in the world and just generally reminded everyone why they want this game now.
- Resident Evil 7, apparently the game is now entirely first person, a survival horror(BIG emphasis on survival there) playable in VR and just downright creepy.
- Spider-Man, this time coming from Insomniac and I don’t know how to feel about that, but then I love Ratchet and Clank, Sunset Overdrive was like Jet Set Radio on speed, so maybe Insomniac can be the people that do everyone’s web slinger justice.
- Crash Bandicoot, yay they’re bringing Crash back in abrand new title, oh no…it’s just a remaster of the old games – yay?
- Lego Star Wars 7, well I think of almost all the lego franchise games the Star Wars ones really shone and I liked The Force Awakens so yeah I’m ready, there’s a demo available now and then the full game releases June 28th 2016.
- South Park: The Fractured But Whole, it looks like more of the first game and that’s not necessarily a bad thing(dependent on your tolerance of South Parks trademark humour).
Nintendo press conference
(The super excited kids that do not care at all what the big kids think of them, they may be a little weird, but they are the thinkers, they are the pioneers and when it really comes down to everything they just like making everyone else smile)
- Literally basically only one thing that everyone cares about and is worth me mentioning here… Pokémon! Ha I jest, obviously Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild is coming and my word the HYPE is REAL. It looks closer in visual style to Windwaker and that is fantastic news, it’s very open world and(time will tell) I think it will be a fitting swan song for the WiiU before it sees it’s replacement in the not too distant future.
Honourable mentions
- Prey, remember when Prey 2 was a thing and then it was no longer a thing? Well the current incarnation looks very pretty and though there was very little shown is a potential one to watch.
Hayfever sucks right?
- Dishonored 2, there was a whole heap more gameplay shown off at e3 this year, including a very attractive and cool looking time travel mechanic. The steampunk is strong with this one.
Nothing like kicking someone in the nuts and time jumping outta there. Biff would love this thing,
- Skyrim remaster, so you remember that little indie developer that put out that massive title that the critics swooned over and nobody ever bought? Well that very same indie darling is coming to our current gen super sparkly consoles. It is a treat for the eye holes and is reportedly coming October 2016.
But just look at that snow...
- We Happy Few, for me this really caught my attention. Think of it as a kind of Equilibrium(a terrifically underappreciated film) with the roles reversed, the people in this world take “joy” pills and see the world very differently. The crux of the demo showed that you come off your meds and you have to act “normal” in increasingly odd situations, if they notice that you are acting strange, authorities will hunt you down in what is apparently a procedurally generated world. Creepy, but fascinating and reminded me a lot of Bioshock(more specifically the storytelling in Infinite).
Have you taken your joy?
Well then, let’s sum this up shall we? I think e3 was good this year, new games are all so close with many dropping just before the end of the year and there at least seems that there is something for almost everyone. A few titles have been pushed to the new year, but with some of the most hotly anticipated AAA titles due in Q4 of this year and some fantastic indie titles and more in the interim. There is definitely enough to keep you(yes you) busy, anyway if you are anything like me your most anticipated game is Yooka-Laylee and that isn’t due to drop until Q1 of 2017, jokes on all of them, I'm really good at playing the waiting game.
Imagine how many nappies I will have changed by then, on second thoughts I don’t think I want to imagine…Industrial cleaning and pressurised gas tank relaxing

EW reports that “The West Wing” alum Timothy Busfield has been cast as Benjamin Franklin, who will appear in a recurring capacity during the show’s second season, which began filming yesterday.
In the show’s revisionist history, Crane will have reluctantly apprenticed under the Founding Father before being sent through to modern day.
“Last season, we created this history between Ichabod and George Washington that talked about this secret war that was part of the American Revolution,” said executive producer Mark Goffman to.”
Early last year, the actor and director traveled to Wilmington to play a gifted doctor in an episode of NBC’s ‘Revolution,” which shot its first season locally.

I woke up thinking I probably wouldn’t bother, but when Sloppy offered me a ride, I figured I may as well go – it was Chuckie’s 400th run afterall! We set off early, dropping Sloppy’s shoes off and picking CW up before heading south. In a year, when the road is complete, it won’t be so bad, but it took a good hour and a half to get there!
The songthaew was of course late, just a little, and we were off just after the usual start. I jogged off and promptly went wrong at the first check. I checked too far, but by the time I got back to check we were no closer to solving it. WTH? All the pack were milling around – surely everything had been checked? I spotted Sheep Shagger in the field, just past some “scary” cows, pointing at something on the ground – JC headed towards him, and so did I. Sure enough he’d forgotten the words “ONON”, and finally we were off. I caught them up at the next check, and there was the hare on his bike. Hmmmm… I checked towards the hare, and spotted a road the arced around – I wasn’t on, but had a feeling I would be soon! Sure enough I ran into another circle, called it, and then tried to find the right way to get to it. From here the obvious way was over a concrete bridge? weir? I went over, and poked around for a bit, but found nothing. Going back the pack was converging, and the hare came along and hinted that maybe I hadn’t quite looked hard enough – I was back over the water, and this time got it, with Spitz Spunk hot on my tail.
We had a stretch through some dried out rice fields, which was quite tough going – it wasn’t easy to find the right pace as with every step your ankles got turned in different directions – walking was fine, but any kind of jog wasn’t easy. Sloppy got a lead, but it only lasted for 1 circle, before HRA took the front. The checks came quick and fast, and several times we went from circle to circle with the pack rotating nicely through a little village. Sheep Shagger egging me on with some short sprints. Clearly we were rotating right, and at some point we would have to cross the water again. Sloppy was leading again for a bit, and then HRA back at the front. Chuckie seemed to be constantly just off the front. I was working hard and finally got my break through an orchard. Finally I put together a sequence of checks and was trotting down a lane with CW not far behind.
The trail turned back into the uneven dried up rice fields, and with my knee / ankle history, I had to slow down. CW caught me up and we discussed the “obstacle” mentioned in the harebrief – clearly it was something to get us back across the water – if it was a balance obstacle, then I was fucked… if it was a wet feet obstacle, then CW was fucked! He slipped past, and after a longer stretch without checks, Sloppy appeared on my shoulder apparently with little regard for his ankles – he was in it to win it! He passed me at the beer stop. CW grabbed a beer and kept going, I grabbed a beer, and Sloppy just ran off – seriously? since when has Sloppy turned down free beer?!? It was a V check, but Shagless made it easy for me as CW & Sloppy were already heading in the right direction. I followed as other hashers were arriving and got to another circle by a rickety bridge.
CW had crossed the bridge and turned left. Sloppy had stayed this side of the water. I didn’t like the look of the bridge, but I knew home was the other side of the water and it looked as good an option as any. I gingerly edged my way across clinging to the metal handrails. As I got to the other side, CW was coming back from the left, but there was another fork, and he tried that one instead. He’d found a hash sign for the ONONON and was convinced. I made it across the bridge and headed to the right. Sheep Shagger almost caught me up as I finally hit paper…! I’d been going steady for a while, so I still had something in my legs. I made the call and ran!
One more check…. a V check… and when I hit it, it really was a 50/50. Damnit! I didn’t have enough time to be wrong. The mud trail to the left looked tempting – I took 2 steps that way, and then stuck with the road. Around a corner and I could see paper into the distance. Run Forest Run! Poor Sheep Shagger had no choice but to take care of my discarded trail, and so when it straightened out, and when I looked over my shoulder it was Chuckie trudging along behind. A final corner and there was the ONIN. Sorry Sloppy you didn’t get your “triple win”!As Harold Goddard quite eloquently positions the power of story, "The destiny of the world is determined less by the battles that are lost and won than by the stories it loves and believes in."

This year, the Development Studies Club hosted a Career Night (March 29, 2018) focused on the Non-profit, Empowerment and Charity Sector. This is an annual event and students or anyone interested will be able to attend next year. The Career Night has a dual purpose. The first function focuses on featuring and recruiting local non-profit organizations to talk about their employment opportunities and what they can offer to graduating students. And the other focuses on shedding light on the Development Studies program and to foster student's commitment to the program by inviting previous graduates of the program to talk about their experiences and how the program has worked for them in the real world.
This year's event was successful and the event was sold out. The club hopes to continue this needed event in the years to come.
We invited 10 local organizations come down. All these organizations work to deliver a higher quality of living for all Calgarians around the city. They all came forward with information on how students and the public can get involved with them and talked about their internship, practicum, volunteer, and work opportunities they have.
We had four Development Studies graduates come down on March 29th, 2018 to share their stories and struggles navigating the world with their Development Studies Degree.

Lehman College and the University at Buffalo School of Pharmacy and Pharmaceutical Sciences have formed a partnership that will enable students to earn a doctor of pharmacy degree in a shorter amount of time.
Rather than taking four years to complete a bachelor’s degree and another four years to complete the doctor of pharmacy degree, students will complete both programs in seven years. The pharmacy program will guarantee spaces each year for qualified Lehman College students.
A memorandum of agreement was formally signed on last month by Lehman College Provost, Dr. Harriet Fayne, and Dean of the University of Buffalo School of Pharmacy and Pharmaceutical Sciences, Dr. James O’ Donnell.
"It is exciting for Lehman College to affiliate with a top-flight pharmacy school," said Provost Fayne. "We anticipate that this partnership will advance our plan to increase the number of Lehman graduates who earn high-quality degrees and then move on to postgraduate studies and professional careers. A large number of Lehman undergraduates are interested in the health professions. We hope that well-prepared University of Buffalo alumni return to the Bronx and improve the quality of health care in our community."
Under the 3+4 agreement, students will complete three years of undergraduate study in Lehman College’s biochemistry program and then apply to UB’s pharmacy program. Once accepted, students will have their first-year pharmacy courses applied toward completion of their bachelor’s degree at Lehman College.
"The University at Buffalo School of Pharmacy and Pharmaceutical Sciences values our strong collaboration with Lehman College, and this 3+4 agreement will further solidify this partnership. We look forward to having their best and brightest students as members of our PharmD program," said Dean O’Donnell.

Pinus albicaulis Engelm.
The range of the White-Bark Pine in our region is from 8,000 to 10,500 feet, but it is as the tree of timber line that it holds most interest. At that point, which varies according to exposure and soil, this pine lies in dense mats, flattened by the long season of heavy snows. In slightly lower altitudes, such as near Boothe and Fletcher lakes, it sends its branches upward, making the tree seem a clump of whitish-gray trunks with a rounded crown of yellowish-green needles, very fresh-looking and stiff. In protected slopes it reaches a height of thirty or forty feet, and at times a large single trunk of unusual size takes on a coloring and appearance not unlike that of the Tamarack, which often occurs with it. Ordinarily, however, a group of slender stems with rather bushy branches forms the unit. The bark is thin, with whitish scales.
It is a White Pine, with needles five in a cluster. They vary from one and a half to two and a half in length, and remain on the tree for from five eight years.
The rather large, stout cones have scales thickened at the tip into a prickly umbo, and are from one and a half to three and a half inches in length. The chocolate color of the cones is very striking; they shine as if they had been newly varnished, and often have a purple sheen. The Clark crows are particularly fond of their large, sweetish nuts. The cones mature in August or September of their second year, opening slowly to shed the seeds. The wings of the seeds remain attached to the scales. At Tioga Pass, and, indeed, in all our high mountain passes, this is the tree that most impresses an observer, accentuating the bleakness of the subalpine landscape. I remember a point on the Donohue Pass Trail where the desolate black peak of Mount Lyell rises above the glacier beyond a clump of these dead and ghostly trees scoured white by wind and snow.

CRAIG FLEMING of cutting edge agri-tech firm CENSIS spoke at the 11th European Conference on Precision Agriculture in Edinburgh on Tuesday July 18. Here, he offers his thoughts on how advances in affordable sensor technology, as applied to livestock and crops, are going to fundamentally change farm management practices in the years ahead...
"A GREAT deal of attention has been paid to the next industrial revolution – yet, comparatively little has been given to the transformation brewing in agriculture. The Internet of Things (IoT) is going to fundamentally alter the way farming works – and Scotland could be the place where it truly kicks off.
Work is already underway. CENSIS, along with industry partners, is trialling the deployment of long range, low power, wide-area IoT infrastructure at rural sites in Crianlarich and Orkney. These LoRaWAN networks provide greater range at lower power and cost than existing network technologies. This means connectivity for IoT sensors can be brought to areas of Scotland that, currently, can only dream of a 3G or Wi-Fi signal.
The temptation might be to think it’s a direct replacement for broadband, or that it can be used to transfer large amounts of information – but, that’s not what it’s about. Instead, LoRaWAN carries lots of small bits of data that, combined, create a picture of what is happening on a farm. That data can then be used to identify early signs of disease, deliver operational efficiencies, and reduce costs.
Dairy farmers are already seeing the benefits of the IoT for increasing milk yield and identifying illness. Many are using smart leg tags or neck collars to monitor animals, with information fed back to them on their phones. There are plenty of other examples.
The introduction of LoRaWAN will widen the opportunity to other areas. This new technology is going to remove range restrictions and enable battery or solar power for sensors, which will enhance farmers’ ability to manage disease, pathogens, and soil fertility. They’ll be able to identify these kinds of problems earlier and more effectively, and then take action to prevent significant damage to their livestock or crops.
CENSIS is taking a national lead in delivering access to these technologies, supporting the Scottish Government’s commitment to the development of a national LoRaWAN. It’s also assisting other strategies, such as the call for a specific UK Animal and Plant Health IoT, which embeds a web of flexibly interconnected sensors and data nodes.
Looking at the wider impact of Industry 4.0, we also believe it’s a great opportunity for farmers to streamline their businesses. Tagging equipment will help farmers, not only keep track of expensive machinery, but analyse its condition and patterns of use. Other systems can provide better visibility of how much fuel oil, chemicals and fertilisers are on-site. Meanwhile, sensors in barns could also be used to protect grain or animal feed by providing alerts to damp, mould or excessive temperature changes.
Scotland is leading the way in these technologies – many of them will be on display at this year’s European Conference on Precision Agriculture (ECPA). Hoofprint Technologies, Stream Technologies, and a host of others are just some of the companies pointing the way forward for farming’s future. Between them, they’ll be monitoring soil conditions, people’s movements and CO2 levels, among a range of data, live at the show.
In fact, they’ll also be demonstrating technology from further afield. A selection of these systems have been installed at Scottish Rural College’s (SRUC) research farm at Kirkton, near Crianlarich. We’ll be showing live data from the site in our demonstration area, including animal tracking from Hooftprint Technologies, plus maximum and average wind speeds and direction, courtesy of TheWindOP.
This is no passing fad: the IoT is the biggest change in agriculture for decades. There are clear challenges facing farmers across Scotland. But for every problem, we’re developing new and more sophisticated ways of overcoming them – LoRa has gone some way towards shifting that dial. It’s time for farming to embrace the change and connect with the technology being pioneered on.The name Ed and Eve is just insurance that the mode refer Male and Female years to clients in the Canada area.

Visit our Ford Trucks home for more.
The 6.4L Powerstroke was released in, more strict, an important concern with competitors continuing to upgrade the horsepower in their existing engine platforms.
Despite the efforts of Ford and International/Navistar, the 6.4 Liter (Litre) has shown some reliability issues, many of which are similar to the issues seen in the 6.0L, though some are unique. These issues can actually be more costly to repair than those on the 6.0L, leading many owners to consider replacing their 6.4 L.4L Powerstroke can be made very reliable at a cost which is more economical than taking a loss on the truck and gaining a new truck payment.
Below we cover almost all of the known conditions and failures related to the 6.4l Powerstroke Diesel engine. Many, but not all of these conditions and failures can be attributed to neglect, power adding devices or improper/lack of maintenance.
With all the problems with the previous 6.0L right out of the gate, we had hoped to see significant gains in reliability with the introduction of the 6.4L. For the most part this has been the case, however, there have been some issues which have led to catastrophic engine failure. Many of these failures can be attributed to improper or lack of maintenance. There are also many cases where components have failed and lead to engine failure as well. The best way to avoid this scenario is to follow Ford's service recommendations to the letter and keep records if serviced by you or a facility other than the Ford dealer. This will aid in attaining warranty should an issue arise.
6.4L catastrophic engine failure
Catastrophic engine failures have not been all that uncommon on the 6.4L, we will cover the most common causes for these failures. This information comes from sources such as warranty analysis, reports from other Professional Automotive Tech's and our own experiences.
Cooling system
The cooling system includes radiator, oil cooler, EGR coolers, etc.
Failed EGR coolers
When one or both EGR coolers rupture, coolant will enter the exhaust system. In a hot soak, this coolant can accumulate in the exhaust manifold and enter cylinders through open exhaust valves causing a hydrolockedignition..
Water which passes through the separator will also cause serious damage to the high-pressure fuel pump and injectors. Lack of lubricity and rust which will form on the fuel system parts causing system damage which if caught early enough, requires injector, pump and line replacement, and flushing of the fuel supply system. There is not much tolerance for contamination on these modern high-pressure common rail injection systems, and this system is especially sensitive to any contamination of the fuel system.
Frequent DPF regen will lead to more rapid elevated oil levels. If you do a lot of heavy towing it is important you follow the severe service schedule found in your trucks diesel supplement guide.
As stated earlier, leaking fuel injectors are most often a result of deficiencies in the fuel supply system. These can run from low supply pump volume to restrictions in the supply line from tank to lift pump, to not adhering to the fuel filter maintenance requirement. The requirement to drain the HFCM water separator every thirty days of use is absurd, to say the least, but it is what it is until the aftermarket comes up with a reasonably priced solution. The fuel supply system on the 6.4l Powerstroke diesel is completely inadequate under all but the best conditions. This is why it is important to follow the maintenance schedule. Leaking injectors can drip fuel during a hot or overnight soak, leading to a hydrolocked cylinder, and cause an over-fueling condition while running. A damaged and leaking injector can eventually lose its nozzle tip into the combustion chamber and cause catastrophic engine damage and/or burn pistons to the point of complete failure.
The latest software strategies have enhanced oil level and cooling system monitoring, fuel supply system monitoring, improved DPF function, etc.
The Operation
The 6.4L Powerstroke differs greatly from previous Powerstroke engines, particularly in its use of a Siemens-designed Common-Rail Diesel fuel injection system. The 6.4L does use many other systems which are similar to the 6.0L Powerstroke, such as an Exhaust Gas Recirculation (EGR) system, as well as a Variable Geometry Turbocharger (VGT). This section provides a brief overview of the operation of the 6.4L and its sub-systems. For problems associated with these and other systems, as well as solutions to these problems, read the Issues and Answers sections below.
Fuel System Operation
The 6.4L Common-Rail Diesel fuel system uses 3 main components, including a fuel lift pump, a high-pressure fuel pump, and 8 electronic fuel injectors. For more on Common-Rail Diesel systems, see our Common-Rail Diesel Systems article. This platform had a number of first's in the light heavy-duty truck market, most notably a two-point high-pressure control system. This system allows for a much faster response to changing needs and driver input.
The fuel lift pump is mounted to the frame under the left-hand side of the cab. It is incorporated into the HFCM, this module contains a water in fuel sensor, fuel heater element, and filter. This pump delivers low-pressure fuel to the high-pressure fuel pump, through the primary, then up to the secondary fuel filter. Seal failures of the high-pressure pump are common enough to mention. A seized high-pressure pump is a direct result of fuel supply system deficiencies, water or other debris in fuel. a high-pressure pump failure requires the replacement of all eight injectors and all high-pressure fuel lines. Read more about fuel system failures.
The high-pressure fuel pump, or fuel injection pump, pressurizes fuel and delivers it to a pair of fuel rails, mounted under the valve covers. The fuel rail pressure (FRP) is controlled by a pair of valves located on the inlet and outlet of the fuel injection pump. These valves control the amount of fuel which is allowed to enter the fuel injection pump, as well as the amount of fuel which is delivered to the fuel rails on the outlet side of the fuel injection pump. Excess fuel from the fuel injection pump is delivered to a fuel cooler, then back to the HFCM manifold, before it is returned to the fuel tank.
The fuel injectors on the 6.4L receive a constant supply of high-pressure fuel which is stored in the fuel rails. The fuel injectors are opened and closed electronically, with the amount of fuel delivered to the combustion chamber being controlled by a combination of fuel rail pressure and fuel injector pulse-width, which describes the amount of time the fuel injectors are open.any deficiencies in fuel pressure and most importantly, volume, will cause high-pressure pump and fuel injector failure, and if not addressed, total catastrophic engine failure.
Variable Geometry Turbo Operation
The 6.4L features a dual, sequential turbo system, a smaller turbo, and a larger turbo with variable geometry. This system is designed to greatly reduce turbo "lag". The VGT uses an electronically controlled actuator, thereby controlling turbocharger speed as well as exhaust backpressure and intake manifold boost pressure. The VGT is also used in conjunction with the EGR valve to control EGR system operation. The system also incorporates a throttle plate the aid in EGR Flow.
Exhaust Gas Recirculation System Operation
The EGR system on the 6.4L uses 4 main components, including an EGR valve, a pair of EGR coolers, a throttle plate as well as the VGT. The EGR system is designed to lower combustion temperatures, thereby reducing the production of oxides of nitrogen, which contribute to smog and acid rain. For more on this, read our Exhaust Emissions article.
The EGR valve controls the flow of exhaust gases into the intake manifold. These exhaust gases must flow through the EGR coolers, which are coolant-to-exhaust coolers that, Throttle plate position as well as EGR valve position.
Engine Oil Cooler Operation
The 6. The coolant then exits the engine oil cooler and is passed back into the cooling system. Proper cooling of the engine oil on the 6.4L is critical since this oil is used to cool internal engine components which engine coolant cannot reach. For more on engine oil cooler operation, see the Issues and Answers sections below.
Cooling System Issues
There were radiator failures on some of the early build trucks. The root cause of these failures was later determined through warranty failure analysis to be a hyperextension of the by-pass thermostat. This would cause the primary thermostat to oscillate leading to thermal spikes within the cooling system and stress on the radiator. Any of the F 250-F 550 with the 6.4L Diesel, 2008-2010 may experience radiator failure. The addition of a venturi tee, replacement of thermostat's and radiator on early build trucks (on or before 9/14/09) was done. Problem solved, so we thought. Low coolant levels cause temperature spikes which can stress the radiator. This can affect any 6.4L from 2008-2010. The EGR valve itself is water cooled and we have seen a few of them develop cracks. There are also hose connections around the engine that can develop leaks. Oil cooler failures are not nearly as common as they were on the 6.0L but we have seen several rupture type failures, though at this point plugging of the coolant passages has not been much of an issue. A rupture in the oil cooler heat exchanger will allow engine oil into the cooling system and if left unchecked will destroy all the rubber hoses in the system. If the condition is caught early enough, there are a few methods for cleaning the system that work very well. It is important that the cleaning be done properly to ensure all motor oil has been removed from the cooling system to prevent hose degradation and and eventual failure. Bulletproof Diesel does make an upgraded oil cooler for this application which is a liquid cooled, externally mounted unit .There have been revisions to hoses which connect to the engine, radiator, etc. that address coolant leaks. It has been found cooling system leaks are also a major cause of EGR cooler failure due to localized overheating and stress on the coolers as well as the rest of the system.
Tap water to top off or mix coolant for the 6.4L is unacceptable. If tap water is used in an emergency situation, the cooling system must be completely flushed after repairs, and a 50/50 mixture of Motorcraft Premium Gold Coolant (or equiv.) and distilled water must be installed and maintained.
Maintaining coolant at proper intervals is very important on the 6.0L and 6.4L. Nitrate levels should be checked on a regular basis. I recommend a complete flush of the cooling system every 2 1/2 years regardless of mileage. Silicate based coolant will degrade and drop silicates which can ultimately wind up in the oil heat exchanger, restricting flow or wind up as sediment in the heater core, etc. I've yet to see the recommended coolant go the distance, 5 years, 100,000 miles. We have seen cavitation behind the water pump on both the 6.0L and 6.4L. It's not all that common an issue and only seems to have affected trucks which have had chronic cooling system issues. Low coolant levels even over a short period of time will cause this cavitation behind the water pump and if left unaddressed, will eat away at the engines front cover and eventually leak through directly into the engine's crankcase. Coolant will destroy bearings as well as other engine components rapidly.one of the components that are directly affected is the pushrods. Valve train failures are known to follow front cover failures.
EGR Cooler Issues
The 6.4L Powerstroke has two EGR coolers, the lower of which is mounted to the left side exhaust manifold, failure of which can lead to coolant loss, overheating, and other serious engine damage..
This lower EGR coolers commonly fail due to low coolant levels which leads to thermal spikes, localized overheating and boiling of the coolant within the EGR coolers, causing one or both to rupture and leak coolant into the exhaust manifold. A significant amount of coolant may leak out of the cooler, causing large amounts of steam to exit the exhaust system, causing potential damage to the DOC/DPF and potential engine overheating due to low coolant levels. If the cooler leaks while the engine is not running,.
EGR cooler failure on the 6.4L is directly related to low coolant levels which result from failed radiators and leaks elsewhere in the cooling system. symptoms of low coolant levels are visible leaks on the ground under the truck, smell of coolant when hot, intermittent heat from the heating system and possible high indicated temperatures on the instrument cluster temp gauge. Both coolant and oil levels should be checked regularly on the 6.4L.
Turbocharger Issues
The 6.4L uses dual, sequential turbochargers, the larger of which is a Variable Geometry Turbo. This VGT has not had nearly the sticking issues that the 6.0l turbo has suffered. most of the turbo issues can be attributed failed VGT actuators, temperature related failures of seals, bearing and turbine wheel. Many of these failures can be directly attributed to DPF regeneration and elevated exhaust system temperatures.
Head Gasket Issues
Head gasket failure, also known as "blown head gaskets," on the 6.4L Powerstroke is relatively rare on the 6.4L when compared to the 6.0L, but can potentially result from similar circumstances as 6.0L head gasket failures. Any engine overheating or localized overheating as described above are most likely to lead to head gasket failure, particularly when left unnoticed or left unrepaired for longer periods of time. It is essential that machining of the cylinder head surfaces is performed when replacing head gaskets, despite Ford's stance that the heads cannot be machined. While we here at Fleet Service Northwest, Inc. have only seen two cases of head gasket failure, it should be noted that the severity of this issue on the 6.0L was not fully realized until 2 or 3 years ago, when the oldest of these engines was 5 or more years old. As 6.4Liter Powerstrokes see the higher mileage and longer service lives over the next few years, we may see more instances of these failures. On the other hand, the larger head bolts which the 6.4L uses may prevent this problem from becoming widespread.
The symptoms of head gasket failure are the same on both the 6.0L and 6.4L. The most obvious symptom is venting of coolant from the de-gas bottle under heavy load at the beginning stages of failure. As the condition progresses, the coolant can vent under normal driving conditions. Any truck which has had one or more cooling system failures, such as radiator failure or leaks elsewhere in the system on the 6.4L, is more likely to experience head gasket failure as a result. While head gasket failure on the 6.4L appeared to be less likely than on the 6.0L, we are starting to see more and more failures. In a review of the trucks history, nearly all have suffered from chronic cooling system issues.
Cooling system failures unique to the 6.4L are the main cause for head gasket failure where as factors such as oil cooler failure has been the major contributor to head bolt/ gasket failure on the 6.0L as explained in the 6.0L article.Head gasket failure on the 6.4L is becoming more common. The root causes differ from those which caused the 6.0L head gasket failures, but they have one thing in common, areas of localized overheating.
Fuel Injection System Issues
A few failures are unique to the 6.4L platform as opposed to the 6.0L, such as fuel injector failure and high-pressure fuel pump failure, both of which can often result in serious engine damage. The fuel injection system on the 6.4L is very different from the high-pressure oil-operated fuel injectors on the 6.0L and 7.3L Powerstroke engines. Instead, the common-rail diesel injection system uses a singe high-pressure fuel pump to deliver fuel to a common fuel rail. The fuel injectors are then operated electrically, and allow excess fuel to return to the fuel tank. Injection systems of this type are subject to excessive fuel leakage through the injector fuel return ports, as well as problems of leakage and wear of fuel pressure regulation components and the pumps themselves.
Other major fuel injector failure issues include leakage of excess fuel into the combustion chamber while the engine is running or stopped, which can also lead to severe engine damage. Hard starts, rough engine idle and misfires are symptoms the driver is likely to note due to leaking fuel injectors. The best way to prevent fuel injector problems is to replace fuel filters frequently, using only Motorcraft fuel filters, and avoid using low-quality fuels such as off-road diesel or questionably-sourced biodiesels, as fuel acts as a lubricant for the many precision components found in a common-rail fuel injector.
Excess fuel entering a cylinder from a leaking injector while the engine is running can cause that cylinder to overheat due to over fueling and pre-ignition leading to catastrophic failure of the piston or engine seizure. Excess fuel entering the cylinder while the engine is not running can cause hydro locking and may bend connecting rods, similarly to EGR cooler leakage described above. It is important to note that major engine damage has resulted frequently on the 6.4L due to leaking injectors without any indicator lights such as the check engine light ever illuminating. This makes it essential that the driver proactively addresses rough idle, hard starting, and other engine performance issues early before they cause major damage. This includes stopping the vehicle and having it towed to a qualified repair facility if there is a serious misfire or other engine performance issue, as a tow bill is far less expensive than an engine replacement.
Similar to fuel injector failure, the fuel injection pump is also prone to failure due to fuel quality and fuel filter concerns. The pumps may seize, causing the engine to stop suddenly, particularly at high operating temperatures, and may actually restart when the engine cools off. It is essential that this problem be diagnosed immediately, as attempting to run the engine after the fuel injection pump has seized is likely to result in immediate, catastrophic failure of the pump, which can cause damage to other fuel system and engine components.
Additionally, the fuel lines which feed the injectors from the high-pressure fuel rail are prone to leak into the engine crankcase, which can dilute the engine oil and lead to major engine damage. The easiest way to detect this is by checking engine oil regularly, as overfull engine oil is a likely sign of this problem. The fuel lines are mounted under the valve covers, and as a result, fuel will leak into the engine crankcase causing oil dilution and can lead to major engine damage, without visible fuel leakage to the outside of the engine. The newest software strategy has an enhanced oil level monitor. This monitor will alert you to a higher than normal oil level through the message display, set a DTC, etc. it is normal for the 6.4L to have increased oil levels due to DPF regen. Towing heavy loads will increase this effect due to the increased amount of soot that will be trapped in the particulate filter. When pressure differential and exhaust temperature criteria are met, DPF regen will occur. Fuel is injected using injector 7 and 8 on the exhaust stroke of these cylinders. This fuel passes through the exhaust system to the DOC/DPF where it ignites and burns at a very high temperature to burn the soot in the particulate filter to an ash. A portion of the fuel injected into these hot cylinders on the exhaust stroke will pass the piston rings and enter the crankcase elevating the oil level. This is why it is important to change the motor oil every 200 hours of engine operation.
The Answers
There have been significant improvements to the operating system of the 6.4l Powerstroke Diesel to date. These changes have greatly improved the reliability of this platform. One of the best ways you can ensure reliability on any 6.4l, regardless of whether its stock or not is to follow the manufacturers recommended service schedule. Many of the catastrophic failures can be attributed to improper or lack of maintenance.
DPF Delete/Tuning
There are aftermarket DPF delete kits which are available. These require software which turns off DPF regeneration, and some even have the option to disable EGR function. The decision to delete and install these products is not one that should be made lightly. There are warranty considerations, and it is a violation of EPA emissions tampering laws to disable these systems. If you live in a state or area which does not have I/M inspections, it will probably never be an issue. There is also software available which improves economy and performance while keeping the emissions system intact and fully functional for those who might be looking for improvements but live in an area which requires emissions testing.
Deleting these emissions systems has proven to significantly improve economy, performance, and reliability. Keep in kind you will most likely be denied any powertrain warranty coverage on the 6.4L diesel if you've run an aftermarket tuning device, intake system or emissions system delete. there are some dealers who will push claims through with these modifications but it has become very difficult due to the cost of warranty repairs and abuse, so this should be considered before you choose to modify your truck. If you are running a stock truck it is very important you have the latest software updates( flash). Even if your truck is no longer under warranty it is well worth the cost to keep the powertrain control system up to date and will enhance the performance and durability of this platform. Ford has done an outstanding job of supporting the 6.0L and the 6.4L with software upgrades.
EGR Cooler Answers
The EGR Cooler is a within the engine compartment, as the Bulletproof EGR coolers are actually made by replacing the internal components in a stock cooler.
Bulletproof Diesel products are available for installation or purchase from Fleet Service Northwest, Inc.
Turbocharger Answers
While options for upgrading the turbochargers on the 6. For more on this, see the Fuel Injection System section below. Use of performance programmers and tuners should also be done with care, and exhaust gas temperature or "pyro" monitors should be installed and observed by the driver under hard acceleration, when towing, or when pulling hills when using increased-horsepower settings.
Head Gasket Answers
While the 6.4L Powerstroke appears to be significantly less prone to head gasket failures over the 6.0L, cooling system problems, as well as high-performance tunes, can increase the likelihood of this problem. Fleet Service Northwest recommends the installation of ARP head studs any time cylinder heads are removed from the 6.4L. ARP head studs have proven themselves to be the solution to head gasket failure on the 6.0L over the last several years, and are often installed proactively on that engine. And as with the 6.0, 6.4L cylinder heads should be skimmed or milled to remove any pitting, erosion and uneven surface issues, however I would not exceed .005 on the 6.4l cylinder head. If measurements indicate any more material than .005, I suggest cylinder head replacement.
Fuel Injection System Answers
The many problems that both affect and are caused by the fuel system on the 6.4L Powerstroke are of great concern to all 6.4L Powerstroke owners and are largely preventable through extra preventive care that goes beyond manufacturer-recommended maintenance. As stated above, fuel injection system components are lubricated by fuel and are sensitive to fuel shortages and fuel quality issues. Using Motorcraft fuel filters and replacing them frequently is a good way to lessen the risk of fuel system damage. Motorcraft fuel filters for both the 6.0L and 6.4L have patented features that are not available even on high-quality aftermarket filters, and as a result, filter water better than most aftermarket filters. It should be noted that Ford recommends draining of the HFCM module should be done every 30 days, while in use. They did not make this task very convenient on the F Series, however, it should be done. If you experience a major fuel system failure on the 6.4L, there is a very high probability you will be paying for this repair yourself. This is why it is important for you to follow the recommended fuel system service intervals.
Fuel quality and refueling practices are of equal importance since contaminants in fuel both cause direct damage and will cause fuel filters to clog more quickly. Fuel shortages due to clogged filters cause high-pressure fuel components to run without lubrication. For this reason, it is essential that only Ultra-Low Sulfur Diesel is run in 6 job sites. Sealing surfaces of fuel filler caps should also be checked periodically for wear since dust and debris can enter the fuel filler via a worn fuel filler cap seal.This is especially true on trucks with flat beds where there is a lot of road spray during wet driving conditions as the fuel filler cap and the end of the filler pipe is not usually protected by a fuel door.
I know of several 6.4L Powerstroke Diesels in a fleet which has nearly 200,000 miles and has had no serious issues. The common denominator is that they have all been religiously maintained and have had all the latest upgraded cooling system and software updates as they became available. So it is possible to get many trouble free miles of service from the 6.4L.
Checking engine oil on a regular basis and servicing the engine with Motorcraft's Super Duty Diesel Engine Oil is a great way to protect the engine from wear and damage, including damage due to leaking fuel system components. If engine oil is overfull or appears thin, this may be a sign of fuel system leakage into the crankcase, among other problems that could lead to major engine damage. Catching these problems as early as possible will prevent damage and extend the life of your 6.4L Powerstroke.Congratulations on buying and trying Jolly Gel - you will be so glad you did!

Jolly Gel is formulated for sand-filters filled with Silex (sand), glass media or zeolite.
It is not suitable for paper filter cartridges or DE filters.
For paper filters (cartridges) use Jolly Gel Spa, which can be placed in the pump or skimmer basket.
Jolly Gel removes suspended particles 5 times smaller than sand (or glass) can alone.
It works in a totally different way to other clarifiers by placing a glutinous, porous membrane over and between the grains of filter media.
The membrane catches particles on contact and holds them 'prisoner' until the next back-wash. The membrane, and everything that it has caught, is flushed away during a regular back-wash.
Jolly Gel cleans the water so perfectly that it becomes almost invisible!
And it saves much more money than it costs . . .
How?
1. By reducing back-washing
Jolly Gel gets the water so clean there is nothing left for the filter to catch, and back-washing can be reduced to every 3 - 6 weeks instead of weekly, producing a big saving in water bills. Costly chemicals and heat are also lost during back-washing. When the pool is topped up from mains supply the pool temperature drops - so the pool heater has to run for longer to compensate.
Approx. annual saving of 10,500 US Gallons (40m³) of water in an average 50m³ private pool.
2. By removing Phosphates (algae food)
Jolly Gel strips phosphates from the water. Without food algae cannot grow, so less sanitiser is needed and chemical bills are reduced.
3. By extending equipment life
Here's where we get a little technical but please read on and all will be explained . . .
Jolly Gel works in a totally different way to other pool clarifiers.
Unlike other clarifiers it is not dosed into the pool - it goes in the pump strainer basket (NOT IN THE SKIMMER).
Circulating water dissolves the gel, which then fills the spaces between the grains of filter media to increase filter efficiency, removes the tiniest suspended particles and DOUBLES the life of the media.
Jolly Gel stays in the filter, working its' magic, and does not get out into the pool-water.
Sand-filters are normally filled with a very special type of sand called Silex - produced by crushing silicate rock.
Most of the world's sand is more-or-less round because it has been knocked about in water, causing the rough edges to be broken off. Think about pebbles on a beach or in a river - they are all pretty much rounded. No matter how tightly the pebbles are packed together there are big gaps between them.
'Round' sand is totally useless in a sand-filter, but Silex is NOT rounded - its grains have flat faces and sharp angles.
Now imagine 2 grains of Silex, glass media pressed tightly together in your filter. It's the size of the tiny gap between the grains that determines how small a particle can be physically trapped there.
New Silex will filter to around 15 microns (15 millionths of a metre). When the little gaps between the grains become plugged up with trapped particles, filter pressure increases and the amount of water being returned to the pool at the Jets is reduced. At this point the filter must be back-washed.
Back-washing damages the filter media
During a back-wash the water flow is reversed through the filter and the filter bed is 'fluidised': - the media is now in really turbulent water and the grains smash into each other, just like on a beach.
The result is that microscopic particles are chipped off the grains. These micro-particles are much too small to be caught in a sand-filter - they're even too small to sink to the floor of the pool!
They are constantly recirculated around the pool and, as they pass through the sand-filter, they erode the sand because they are exactly as hard as the material they were chipped-off from.
After 3 years or so the erosion is so bad that all the sharp edges are worn away, all the flat faces become pitted and the sand becomes rounded. The filter is no longer capable of keeping the water clean; so the media must be changed. This costs anything from €350 upwards, depending on the size of the filter.
When Jolly Gel is used the abrasive particles of filter media are caught in the glutinous membrane on contact, and flushed to the drains during a normal back-wash.
The result is that there is now absolutely nothing left in the water for the filter to catch and therefore back-washing can be reduced to every 3 - 6 weeks instead of weekly.
Less frequent back-washing dramatically reduces wear-and-tear on the filter media - giving it at least DOUBLE the life, and often much longer.
NOTE: if you have glass media either get rid of it or immediately start using Jolly Gel. The microscopic chips of glass can enter the eyes and cause permanent damage, but Jolly Gel will catch them!
3a Do you have a salt pool? You can use Jolly Gel!
The abrasive micro-particles of filter-media also erode the coating of Ruthenium, Tantalum and Iridium on the plates of a salt-water chlorinator cell (replacement plates cost €700 and upwards!), the platinum tip of a pH probe (replacement cost €80 to €150), etc.
Removing micro-particles of filter media with Jolly Gel will greatly extend the life of these items and much other pool equipment.
You'll be pleasantly surprised at just how effective Jolly Gel is!

How to use Jolly Gel
Remove the plastic bag and place the first cube of Jolly Gel in the pump strainer basket.
Note:- It does not matter if the cube has dehydrated and shrunk - it will re-hydrate with no loss of performance.
Run the filter for 24 hours, continuously if possible.
Backwash and rinse the filter, then return to your normal filtration timings.
That's it - you're done!
Note: - It is only necessary to run the pump for 24 hours the first time Jolly Gel is used. Subsequent applications do not require this unless the pool has been allowed to get cloudy.
Apply a new cube every 3 weeks for a permanently transparent pool.
How can I find out if I have these 'invisible' micro-particles in my pool?
Wait until it's dark and then turn the pool lights on - if you can see a 'fan' of light - you have them. (And they're costing you money!)
Now use Jolly Gel for 24 hours and try again - you will not see a fan of light because all the particles will be GONE. Locked away in the Jolly Gel membrane inside the filter! They'll stay there until you next back-wash.
Your equipment will be starting out on its extended life, saving much more money than the cost of the Jolly Gel!
Do not freeze Jolly Gel and protect it from frost.
Spanish Homologation Number: 12-70-4627
If your pool is often cloudy it is probable that the filter media needs to be changed - but Jolly Gel will give your sand-filter
an extra lease of life!
Important Note
When using Jolly Gel for the first time, it is important to monitor the pressure reading within the first six hours, or dependent on the filter cycle.
The reason for this is that Jolly Gel collects suspended particles much faster than any other flocculent.
Be aware that the filter pressure will rise faster than normal and it may need to be back-washed sooner than normal.
When the water has been thoroughly cleansed by Jolly Gel, the normal filtration routine can be resumed.
Note:- Jolly Gel is not suitable for DE or cartridge filters.
FAQ's
I put a cube of Jolly Gel in the pump strainer basket and it’s still there after 48 hours?
There could be three reasons why the Jolly Gel cube is still in the basket:
1 - You have not run the pump for 24 hours.
2 - The water temperature is below 26C (78F) – if this is the case the cube will dissolve more slowly.
3 - You forgot to remove the cube from the little plastic bag . . . . . .
The Jolly Gel cube has gone hard – is this a problem?
Jolly Gel cubes dehydrate and harden over time, particularly so if it has been stored in high ambient temperatures. The cube going hard is not a problem. Once immersed in water it will return to its original shape and size and will perform perfectly.
How many cubes should I use?
You only need to use one cube, placed in the pump basket (not in the skimmer). One cube will service up to 60m³ (15,850 US gallons) of water for three weeks.
How often do I need to use Jolly Gel?
Continuous use (one cube every 3 weeks) will ensure that the pool is always completely transparent and maximize the extended life of the filter and other pool equipment. Remember that it is not necessary to use Jolly Gel when the pool is closed for winter, so 2 packs a year are often sufficient for most private pools.
Can I put the cube in the skimmer basket?
It is not advisable to put Jolly Gel in the skimmer basket. The skimmer basket collects general debris (e.g. leaves, insects). Jolly Gel is a glutinous substance, so leaves and general debris will stick to it. The recommendation is to place the cube only in the pump strainer basket.

In this article, we will find out why Google penalized these revenue-generating pop-ups and what are the alternatives for these pop-ups on the WordPress website.
Top 3 Reasons Why Google Penalized Intrusive Pop-Ups?
Mobile devices are considered to be the highly used device for web searches. When pop-ups appear on any website on a mobile device, it blocks the content that the visitors expect to see. These pop up direct the user to any newsletter or Facebook pages, so, he may not be able to search what actually the user is looking for.
Keeping this mobile browsing experience in mind, here are the top 3 reasons Why Google penalized Popups.
1. Main content gets blocked: As stated above, intrusive pop-ups block the main content of the website by appearing on the full screen. These interstitial ads and pop-ups are also referred to as the most annoying ads on mobile.
2. Accidentally clicking ads: These annoying ads cover the entire page and have only a small button to dismiss it. This lead to inevitably click on the ad even though the user didn’t want to clink these ads.
3. Poor user experience: Due to these intrusive pops and ads, the pages show a poor user experience than the other pages where content is easily accessible.
These are the reasons behind the penalty of intrusive pops and interstitial ads. The exception will be made for age verification and small pop-ups that take up only a fraction of your screen.
What Penalty Google has made on The Websites Using Pop-Ups?
The ultimate aim of Google is to help users quickly find the best solutions to their questions, regardless of the device they are using.
To improve the mobile search experience, Google decided to penalize the websites using Pop-Ups by ranking them low in the search results. The worst website would be rank last in the search results.
After January 10, 2017, pages where content is not easily accessible on mobile search results were not ranked as high as they used to be earlier.
The big Dilemma and the Solution
After Google has penalized intrusive pop-ups, there are two dilemmas’ you are most likely to face:
1. If I show ad using intrusive pop-ups on a mobile device, then my site will rank lower in Google.
2. If I don’t show these pop-ups, how will I show my offers and grow email subscribers list?
Don’t worry! The solution to this dilemma is here. There are some green signals provided by Google for which pop-ups won’t be considered as punishable and will not lower your site rank.
These Signals are:
The interstitial ads appear for any legal obligation like for cookie usage or age verification will not be considered as punishable.
Login dialogues on websites where content is not publicly indexable like email or unindexable content that is behind a paywall.
Banners that use less screen space are not penalized by Google.
Three Alternatives for WordPress to Keep Your Rankings Intact and Convert Intrusive Pop Ups to Friendly Pop-Ups
To save your website from Google penalty, here are 3 alternatives that will increase your search engine rankings.
1. Hide Pop-Ups on Mobile Devices
If you are accessing through desktop and your website have a Pop-Ups, hide the same pop-ups for mobile devices to avoid Google punishment.
This is a smart move, as the visitors visiting your website through desktop will be able to see the pop Ups and you can generate revenue with the desktop pop ps. However, by targeting only the desktop visitors, these pop-ups will not be shown on mobile devices and hence your website will not get penalized by Google.
2. Use another ad/ messaging styles
There are hundreds of opt-ins other than these popup or full-screen overlays that are highly effective.
Opt-ins has a high conversion rate and is easier to adjust on a mobile screen. Opt-ins is a narrow bar at the bottom of your webpage. This opt-in is also a pop-up, but not the intrusive one that fills the screen.
To get rid of pop-ups and start using the below solutions to overcome Google’s penalty:

3. Two Step Pop-ups
Sometimes, when you need the whole screen to represent what you offer, intrusive pop-ups are inevitable. In such cases, you may go for two-step pop-ups. In this process, your page will have a button or a link.
- In the first step, visitors will click on it.
- In the second step, it will cause a full-screen ad to pop-up, hence properly present what you are offering and increase the number of visitors on your website.
Who are the most likely to be affected by Google’s Penalty on Pop-Ups?
The Google’s penalty on intrusive pop-ups and the fear of losing rank will be a cause of concern for these people:
- Online store owners
- Plugin sites that make Pop-ups, Interstitial Ads
- Marketers
- Bloggers
- Life Coaches and the people using AdFly etc.
If you are from one of the above-mentioned categories and are using a zero second pop-ups or interstitial ads, kindly resort them to one of the alternatives mentioned in this article.B.Sc. in Computer Science, University of the Balearic Islands.

Ann Fletcher's Birthday Handbell WeekendMany of the writers I know are quite proud of it.
“Oh, I never write letters anymore,” they say, nodding. “I’m just too busy. I email or text.”
Elsewhere, I’ve already confessed to how I changed my mind about computers when I realized how efficient they were for preparing manuscripts.
And I’ll even admit that when pressed for time-- let me rephrase that-- when PARTICULARLY pressed for time-- I may do a little recycling with a letter. I’ll write a letter saying what I’ve been doing lately and then change the "Dear____" part to fit the recipient. After I print it out, I add the personal notes at the bottom before mailing-- and I usually say, “Excuse the generic letter.”
But I stubbornly continue to write personal letters to many friends. Not only that-- but I hand-write some of them, proving that I am stuck in antediluvial times, sinking in the swamp of prehistory.
Here are some of my reasons.
I have only a few of my father’s letters, usually headed with the date and “At the breakfast table.” My parents lived in what is now my writing retreat house, which doesn’t much resemble the way it looked when they were there. The round oak table at which my father wrote is gone; the curtains he pulled aside to look out the window have been replaced by modern shades. The buffet on which he kept a dictionary so he could look up any word about which he was uncertain is in someone else’s home.
But when I see my father’s handwriting on those letters, I can picture him just as he was on those mornings, the blue eyes, the smile he never wore for photographs because he hated them. My mother is cooking breakfast in her blue bathrobe. He has been out and looked at the weather, recording the night’s low in his journal. He’s planning his day. And he’s writing words of advice and love and encouragement to his daughter.
These letters are particularly precious considering how his life ended, in anger and bitterness and confusion. Without seeing that strong handwriting, I might gradually let the good memories be submerged in the horrible ones. The handwriting provides an anchor; a typed copy of the letter would not be the same. Had he been emailing his thoughts, they’d have long since vanished.
Perhaps nothing I write to any of my friends is as important as those notes my father wrote and it may be that none of my friends keep my handwritten notes. That doesn’t matter either. I like the feeling of holding that pen and seeing the words flow onto the paper, even the recycled scraps I sometimes use for notes, tucking them into envelopes with a few clippings of news stories I can imagine discussing with my friends.
I like seeing in my mind’s eye my friends taking those envelopes out of the mailbox, slitting them open, sitting in their favorite chairs. My handwriting conveys my voice, my thoughts, my image in a way no computerized facsimile ever could.
And when I am hand-writing a letter, my mind slows down. I take time to form the letters, picturing the person to whom I am writing.
Fairly often, I discover as I scribble a thought that had been eluding me while I sat at the computer and pecked and stabbed and jabbed and dug and prodded the keys, a thought that could not be born as the cursor blinked.
So whether the post office is efficient or not and no matter how much it charges me for the privilege, as long as mail service exists, I’ll keep folding those letters, hand-addressing the envelopes and hauling them to town, thinking of the people whose handwriting will be on the envelopes I’ll get back in a few days.

The Mets still can’t figure out the Miami Marlins. They blew a 4-1 lead, and lost to the Fish by a score of 8-4. (Box Score) At least it only took 10 innings this time.
The Marlins have won 18 games this year. 8 of them have been against the Mets.
In the bottom of the tenth, Bobby Parnell (in his second inning of work) gave up back-to-back singles to start the inning. Adeiny Hechavarria failed to get a sac bunt down, then took a fastball that could have easily been called strike three. Third-year ump Dan Bellino called it a ball. The overhead cam showed that it barely missed the outside edge. On the next pitch, Hechavarria rolled a slow grounder to Daniel Murphy‘s left. In his haste to get the ball to second, he allowed the ball to skim off his glove and roll into right field. Morrison scored to give the Marlins a 5-4 lead.
Rob Carson came in and let both inherited runners score, in addition to allowing a 2-run homer to Miguel Olivo.
After missing his previous start with shoulder tendinitis, Jon Niese came out firing, striking out the side in the first with a dazzling combination of cutters and curves. But in the second, he allowed two singles and a walk to lead to the Marlins’ first run of the day. Hechavarria, the man who finished the scoring of the 20-inning game, starting the scoring today with an RBI single.
Daniel Murphy, inserted into the cleanup slot by Terry Collins, responded with a solo home run in the bottom of the second to even the game at 1.
In the bottom of the third, the Mets loaded the bases with none out. Juan Lagares led off with an infield single, Niese worked out a walk, and Omar Quintanilla reached on a bunt single. After Jordany Valdespin popped out, David Wright doubled over the head of Justin Ruggiano to plate Lagares and Niese (who initially went back to tag second base, but then recovered well enough to score) to give the Mets a lead. Murphy followed with an RBI groundout to extend the lead to 4-1.
In the top of the sixth, the Marlins made it a 4-3 game on a 2-run opposite field double by Pablo Ozuna. Ozuna went to third when Lagares had trouble picking up the carom off the right-center field wall, but he was stranded there.
Then in the eighth, Derek Dietrich lasered a solo home run into the stands next to the Moe’s Zone off Scott Rice, who was making approximately his 153rd appearance of the year. That tied the game at 4.
I’m sure the Mets would love to have a second lefty they can use in the bullpen. But Rob Carson and Josh Edgin have both been terrible, and the team seems reluctant to rush Jack Leathersich up from Double-A.
Brandon Lyon came in and allowed 3 hits without giving up a run (one of the hits was a grounder by Hechavarria that hit baserunner Logan Morrison. Morrison was out, but Hechavarria got credit for a single).
New Rochelle native Tom Koehler started for the Marlins, and went 7 innings, allowing 4 runs on 6 hits with a walk and 2 strikeouts. The Stony Brook University alum retired 15 of his last 16 batters after a rough beginning.
Chad Qualls got the win in relief (1-0), and Parnell got the loss (4-3).
The Mets’ record drops to 23-35, 8 of those losses coming at the hands of the worst team in baseball.
Questionable Baseball
Jordany Valdespin executed a perfect drag bunt with one out in the first. After moving to second on David Wright’s groundout, he attempted to steal third with two out. He was thrown out with ease by Marlins catcher Jeff Mathis. This is why Valdespin is so frustrating. He has the talent to be an asset to a major league club, but at times it’s impossible to know what he’s thinking on the baseball field.
In the ninth, Collins asked Mike Baxter to bunt with Murphy on first and none out. Even when the count got to 1-2, Collins still left the bunt on. Baxter fouled it off for strike three. Now, I’m not one of those who thinks a bunt is never appropriate, but Baxter can handle the bat pretty well, and with 2 strikes, I’d rather see him swing away. Should he have been bunting at all? Against a LHP, I can see why Collins did it, especially since Baxter (along with almost every other player on this team) doesn’t have a lot of extra-base power. But people who disagree with bunting in that situation have more than a valid point.
Matt Harvey Update
Harvey left yesterday’s game with discomfort in his lower back. Harvey said a chiropractic maneuver straightened it out. “Everything is fine,” Harvey said. “I woke up today. Felt good. They told me my start date is Thursday. So I’m ready to go.”
Up Next
After a much-needed day off, the Mets begin a series with the Cardinals at Citi Field on Tuesday. Young Michael Wacha (0-0, 5.40 ERA) makes his third MLB start against Jeremy Hefner (1-5, 4.36 ERA).
I can’t remember if I felt this bad in 1977.
Ike Davis’ demotion was inevitable, Baxter, I believe was sent down as an example to the other players that if you don’t execute when called upon, you’re not going to be on the MLB club. Carson, interchangeable, IMOPlano Real Estate).

This attractive little goniodorid, Okenia sp. 2, is unknown from Okinawa's main island as of early-February, 2012. The above featured animal is one which was photographed from the rock of a steep slope off of Zamami Island, one of a series of islands in the Kerama Islands Group, which are located 30 ~ 40 kilometers west of the Okinawa capitol, Naha. This featured animal was photographed by Atsushi Ono during March of 2010 in fourteen meters of water. Atsushi's photographs are used here with his kind permission. It should be noted that Atsushi considers the species to be very rare in the Kerama Islands as he has seen only a single individual (pers. comm.). I've added a second page w/ an additional image of the same animal from the Kerama Islands, also photographed by Atsushi.
Okenia sp. 2 is perhaps an undescribed species, I've done a precursory search of miscellaneous opisthobranch literature and can find nothing resembling it.

SagarThese are interesting questions, although it is no easy task to answer them to satisfaction. It is somewhat like asking what would have been the course and history of English literature but for the impetus it received under Queens Elizabeth, Anne, and Victoria. Would England have produced a Shakespeare, Swift and Tennyson? Though his poverty brought on by his father’s debts and the persecution of Sir Thomas Lucy, were the immediate causes of Shakespeare’s flight to London and his choice of the dramatic profession, yet the personal encouragement he received from Elizabeth would certainly have been an important cause that contributed to the eminence he attained in the art She used to accost him in pride as “my Shakespeare.” and the anecdote of her having come into the stage while one of Shakespeare’s dramas was being acted, and her having dropped her handkerchief in order to divert the attention of Shakespeare who was acting the King’s part, so as to make him improvise the two well known lines, is a well authenticated piece of evidence to show the personal interest she evinced in him, It is possible to recall similar anecdotes in the case of Vadivelu Nattuvan and Raghava Iyer, two of the greatest musicians that Travancore has ever produced, though they may not be so generally known. Govinda Marar and Vadivelu were contemporaries and were recipients of allowance from H.H. Swathi Tirunal Maharaja. Raghava Iyer was the pet of H.H. Ayilyam Maharaja. I have here mentioned two of the greatest royal patrons though this does not mean that there were not other less prominent patrons of this noble art in the royal house of Travancore.
As stated above, H.H. Swathi Tirunal was an eminent musician and composer. He played on the Swarabit, and, on this instrument, his own Dewan Mr. Subba Rao was a companion player. What should we think of the importance that would naturally have been attached to music by the people, when the reigning sovereign and his trusted minister were both exponents of the art and took a lively interest in its development? Almost every evening, the Dewan had musical performances at his residence, at which the eminent Vadivelu took part. It is known that there were at least two other composers at that time in Travancore, one of whom as H.H.’s own relative, viz ,Iravi Varman Thampi and the other Ponniah, the younger brother of Vadivelu. There are about 150 of H.H.’s compositions of all varieties, while Tampi;s compositions are said to number nearly 400, though in many cases, the latter were merely the replica of H.H.’s compositions in regard to music. It is a pity that most of Tampi’s compositions hang for their very existence upon the life of an obscure Brahmin Bagavathar who alone knows them and who is not eminent enough to merit any recognition or encouragement. Both His Highness and Tampi were excellent poets too. Some of Ponniah’s varnams, as for instance his Sarasijanabha in Kambodi and manavichay in Sankarabharanam are of a very superior order. Of course, His Highness stands supreme as a composer of varnams, and in point of their number and variety, perhaps H.H. has no equal in the whole field of Hindu music. Many of his varnams are among the best in their respective ragas, and it is a pity that several have been lost through neglect in recording them. It is source of great satisfaction that most of the known compositions of His Highness have already seen the light of day through the untiring industry of Mr. Ranganatha Iyer.
Govinda Marar and Vadivelu (both of whom won the appreciation of Tiagayya of Tiruvayyar, the great composer,) were patronised by H.H. Swathi Tirunal. The first received his allowances from the Palace though he soon left Travancore, intent on his pilgrimage to Benares. Vadivelu received the handsome salary of Rs, 110 at a time when Munsiffs and Tahsildars were paid Rs-40 and 30 respectively. As a singer, he was certainly one of the best of his age, and according to Parameswara Bagavathar, the veteran musician of Trivandrum, was unequalled by any vocalist of a later age. Vadivelu was the man who first introduced the violin into Travancore. He was a dancing master as well as a musician. He was engaged by the Dewan to give performances before him almost every evening to the delectation of the officers who were invited to attend them, and sometimes the Dewan himself took part in the performance with his Swarabit. While Govinda Marar left Travancore for good and alter on distinguished himself at Tiruvayyar and Baroda and died at Pandrapoor near Poona, the native place of the composer Jayadevar, Vadivelu fell into disfavour with his sovereign and lived and died an exile at Haripad, though he continued to received his usual allowances. The name of two other musicians of the time deserve notice. One, Parameswara Bagavathar, who was got down from Palahgat at the early age of eighteen, became a veteran musician and lived through the next four reigns and shone as the leader of the whole band of Palace musicians. The other was a Mahratta Brahmin by name Meruswami, famous for his Bajana songs in Mahratti. The latter possessed a magnificent voice and by his singing exerted a great influence on the art of Katha performance.
His Highness compositions, as already stated, are of almost every variety, Swarajits, Varnams, Kirtanams, Padams, Tillanas, etc. He was master of nearly12 languages and composed in all of them. The compositions are all dedicated to God Padmanabha whose name would appear in most of them, as Tiagayya dedicated his to Rama. One notable feature in his compositions, to which H.H. Visakham Tirunal Maharaja drew attention, may be mentioned, and that is , the appearance of what are called swaraksharas, that is, the swara symbols tallying in important places with the initial or other important letter of the words to which the music is set, a feat rarely attempted by composers and which requires much skill and a consummate mastery of the language. It shewed His Highness extraordinary mastery over the Sanskrit and Malayalam languages. His compositions have ever since been sung by the court musicians and the people alike, and have gladdened the hearts of thousands. His Highness demise took place at the early age of 33 exactly in the year of Tiagayya’s death, viz , 1022 M.E. (1847 A.D)
The next glorious reign as regards the practice of music (not composition) was undoubtedly that of H.H. Ayilyam Tirunal Maharaja (1036-1055 M.E.).It was during this period that he great vocalist Raghava Iyer flourished. It was during the same regin that the famous musical combat between Mahavaithi Iyer and Raghava Iyer took place in the presence of H.H.in 1047 M.E.. It was then too that Kalyanakrishna Iyer, the greatest Veenaist (excepting Seshannah of Mysore) and Mahadeva Iyer, the greatest violinist (excepting Tirukkodikkavoo Krishna Iyer), of the age, began their distinguished careers. His Highness himself was no ordinary vocalist, his superlative merits having been acknowledged by such a great master as Mahavaithi Iyer himself. Of the famous musical combat, no detailed description is here attempted as the subject has been already dealt with by me on two occasions elsewhere. The combat proved that Travancore Could produce musicians who could meet foreign musicians on equal footing, provided the necessary encouragement was forthcoming. Incidentally, it is worthy of note that it was during H.H.’S reign that Raja Ravi Varma, one of the greatest painters of all time worked and won laurels. Raja Kerala Varma, C.S.L one of the greatest Sanskritists and poets rose to prominence, and Narayana Chakkyar, the greatest artist in that interesting field of Chakkiar Kootthu ,(a realistic narration of puranic stories) attained the heighte of his fame. Besides the stars of the first magnitude, viz, Raghava Iyer, Parameswara Bagavathar, Kalyanakrishna Iyer, and Mahadeva Iyer, there was then a cluster of other luminaries, only a little less brilliant, yet fully worthy of mention, viz, kitty Bagavathar, Raghupathy Bagavathar, Ramaswamy Bagavathar, Ganapathy Bagavathar , Ananthu Bagavathar, Satthu Bagavathar and others, some of them living through the next two reigns. All this splendid outburst of musical talent was due originally to the personal encouragement accorded by H.H. Ayilyam Maharaja.
Apart from the reigning sovereigns of Travancore who were themselves good musicians and who actively encouraged the art of music by patronising its votaries, we may now make brief references to the princes and other members of the Royal House who were accomplished in music to a noteworthy extent.
Going as far back as tradition would take us, two of the earliest names in this line were those of the princes Kartigay Tirunal and Aswathi Tirunal who flourished about the middle of the eighteenth century A.D. They were composers of devotional hymns (kirtanams), several of which are still sung in the temple of Padmanabhaswamy. Of these, the second was a Sanskrit scholar of note. The style of the music was of necessity simple, being adapted to the felling of devotion, to say nothing of the fact that there was not much scope in those days for the influx of the modern, elaborate eastern style of Carnatic music into Travancore.
Her Highness Rukhmini Bai (1800 – 1837,) the sister of the Royal composer, H.H. Swathi Tirunal Maharaja and grandmother of H.H Moolam Thirunal Maharaja composed some irthanams. They (?) all simple and touching. The song Sreekantesa Pahi Pahi “in mukhariraga may be cited as a specimen.
Coming to recent times, the names of Raja Kerala Varma, C.S.I , and his Royal consort H.H. Lakshmi Bai, the then Senior Rani, stand out prominent in the sphere of music. Raja Kerala Varma was a musician in so farwas able to play on the Veena. H e was a personal and devoted friend of Raghava Iyer, to whose supert music he often listened with delight. H.H. The Senior Rani was a great expert on the Veena having been taught by the great Veenaist Kalyanakrishna Bagavathar and latterly by his equally distinguished brother Ramachandra Bagavathar. Several prominent European ladies, who had the good fortune to listen to her, have testified to her marvellous skill on this instrument; and foremost among. Her admirers was her own Guru Kalyanakrishna Iyer, who had the modesty to say that Her Highness surpassed him in the art. There were constant musical parties at her palace by the Court Musicians.
In the category of musicians of the Royal House, one can never omit the name of H.H.Aswathi Tirunal, B.A. the late lamented Second Prince of Travancore, who met with an untimely death. His Highness was a thorough musician and could sing as well as any professional whether it was Raga, Thana, Pallavi or Kirtanams. The Prince was (?) proficient in Carnatic, Hindustani, (?) and Tibetan music, and could (?) the Veena. His versatility maybe imagined when it is known that this gifted Prince added his rare intellectual equipments to his accomplishment in this fine art, and his mastery of Sanskrit, Malayalam, English and Photography was not less noteworthy. Almost every evening he listened to the performances of the court musicians and paid them regularly and liberally.
Some reference may here be made to the Mavelikaray Royal family whose members have a traditional attachment to this art and still continue to be its votaries. They exert a whoe some influence on the practice of music in the whole taluk. The late Kunjari Raja was one of the greatest players on the swarabit that ever lived. He also had admirable mastery over the violin, the harmonium and the Jalatarangam. With the Swarabit, he held his ground victoriously against such master-singers as Mahavaithi Iyer and Raghava Iyer. Among living members, the names of the two Udaya Varmas (Senior and Junior) have to be noticed for high proficiency on the Veena.
I cannot close this brief narrative about “ Music and the Royal House” , without making specific mention of Her Highness the present Junior Maharani whose knowledge of the theory and practice of music is simply astonishing. No one who has had the good fortune of listening to her conversation about music can fail to be struck with Her Highness high, keen and refined intelligence, her profundity of knowledge and the vast fund of her information on the subject of music. As a player on the Veena, Her Highness takes rank with the best artists in the field. Her daughter, Princes Kartigay Thirunal, shows precocious natural endowment in the art, which is full of promise. Her noble son, His Highness the present Maharaja, is well-equipped in music, and this fact leads one to entertain the joyous hope that His Highness reign will be one of glorious achievements in the line of this “finest of the finearts”.Welcome back to another week of Intentional Conversations!

Position Yourself to Hear from God
Pour over the Passage and Paraphrase
Just LOVE this step. Plan Obedience, oh how important!…and I do need to give more attention to this step! Thanks for sharing.
I think we all need to give more attention to this step so you are surely not alone 🙂
I am with you too, because I am sure that it is necessary for each person! And of course I’m proud of this step as you are)
I started this week using this method of Bible study and I’ve come up with a question about this…
Do you have obedience to plan every single day? I find it easy to find the principles but get bogged down thinking that I need to come up with something to nail down a deadline for. My church is going through Ecclesiastes and we are hearing a sermon on chapter 9 this Sunday. The principles are easy enough to find, but to determine a deadline for each thing starts to feel artificial. A lot of the principles can be tucked away for future reference, but I may or may not be facing a struggle that needs that specific reminder at the moment.
Any thoughts?
Thanks!
How often do you adjust your plan? For example, I made a plan yesterday, based on my current study of James 1:1-4, to daily thank God for the season I am currently in and the journey He has me walking. I vowed to also search for how He wants me to use it as an opportunity to bless others. I plan to do it for a month. But as I continue to study further, should I make a new goal in addition to this one? That could get a little overwhelming…..Just curious how you and others are handling it.
Thank you both so much for a great plan and way to study God’s Word and grow in Him. I’m looking forward to seeing all He is going to do in my life with it!Property Details

The new revolving credit facility (RCF) includes all previous lenders, Barclays, Credit-Suisse, Deutsche Bank and HSBC. The Bank of China has also joined as a lender and mandated lead arranger.
The new RCF offers many opportunities for Global Switch, including a longer duration, an S$88.4 million increase in facility size and better pricing compared to the last one.
"This new RCF is very good news for Global Switch; we are extremely pleased with the exceptional terms that reflect the strength of our business model and balance sheet. The new contractual terms also provide certainty and flexibility of funding and will help support our next phase of growth and development of the business,” explains Global Switch CEO John Corcoran.
The RCF’s new margin is at sub 1% and the committed facility term matures in April 2021. The improved financial terms represents ‘industry leading pricing’, which means Global Switch can continue to deliver solutions that provide value for money and generate returns for shareholders, the company says.
Global Switch believes that the long-term commitment from the participating banks shows that the company is strong and continuing to display low leverage, as displayed in its credit ratings.
“We are delighted to confirm the continuing long-term support of HSBC, Barclays, Credit Suisse and Deutsche Bank, and we welcome Bank of China as a new lender under the RCF. We remain fully committed to maintaining low leverage over the long run and to further consolidating our current strong investment grade credit ratings,” adds Global Switch CFO David Doyle.
In December 2016, Global Switch introduced a new strategic vendor that represents a consortium of Chinese corporate and institutional investors.
In the same month, Global Switch also secured two major customer pre-commitments for data center services in Singapore and Hong Kong.
The new strategic investor will help grow Global Switch access to telcos and internet providers looking to expand out of China, as well as bring existing Chinese bank relationships to a level that broadens lending support.Add a fabulous focal point to your interior space with the square Rivoli Mirror.

Picture the scene: Your cart abandonment campaign is up and running and the SaleCycle elves are busy at work retargeting your customers and recovering those pesky abandoned carts…
But what’s next? How about a bit of optimisation to help you recover even more sales!
A/B testing is a relatively simple way to grow and optimise your campaign, whether you’re looking to improve open rates or simply change your tone of voice, testing is a great way to ensure your campaign is performing to it’s full potential!
Three SaleCycle clients have kindly allowed us to share their split testing stories, describing the testing carried out and the all important findings. Here’s the tale of three tests…
1 Idle Times
Getting the right timing for your email is crucial, not only for grabbing a customer’s attention while purchasing is still at the forefront of their mind but also to ensure your emails get the strongest open, click through and conversion rates.
There are many variables to take into consideration when testing delivery times, but you can focus on two:
1) Consider the competition – If you know your average customer is likely to have abandoned in order to shop around/compare prices then you may want to reach out to them as quickly as possible – ideally within 20/30 minutes
2) Consider the price point – If you are selling products which generally have a very high order value then customers may be taking a little longer to think things through and you may wish to retarget them between 2 to 4 hours rather than straight away.
Cath Kidston’s Story
Fashion and home retailer Cath Kidston wanted to test a 1 day idle time against shorter timescales to see how their customer base behaved and interactive with their abandonment emails.
Cath Kidston tested sending their emails at 24 hours, 12 hours, 6 hours, 4 hours and 2 hours, and here’s how the results shaped up:
The results demonstrated a pretty clear uplift in Open Rates as the idle times got shorter as it was closer to the time of abandonment when the customer was still within their shopping mindset, and while it was interesting that the open rate did drop a little towards the 4 and 2 hour marks the conversion rates were considerably higher at this point.
The difference between the default of 24 hours and 12 hour test was striking enough with an 11% uplift in the open rate and a 45% increase in the open from send. However the shortest idle time of 2 hours was the clear winner overall with a 13.7% increase in the open rate and a whopping 38% increase in the conversion from click.
Based on the strength of the conversion rates, Cath Kidston have set the idle time for the campaign at 2 hours and continued to achieve steady and impressive results.
2 Subject Lines
As well as the timing of your emails, the subject line is a key component in ensuring you have the best chance of making a connection with your customer. It can make or break how they perceive the content of the email and their subsequent interaction and it’s vital to be clear about you’re hoping to achieve – there are two golden rules we always recommend at SaleCycle
1) Get to the point – keep your subject line short and simple where applicable, think of how it will appear within someone’s inbox where space is limited as well as making a quick first impression. The general rule is to try and keep your subject line to a maximum of 50 characters.
2) Be Open & Honest – You may find during split testing that often the subject line with the highest open rate has the lowest click through rate – this is a sure sign that the customer’s expectation of the email content based on the subject line doesn’t match the reality which can then affect the click through and conversion rates. There’s no point promising something with an awesome subject line that isn’t delivered in the email!
Monsoon’s Story
Fashion retailer Monsoon ran a series of A/B tests to optimise the subject line performance on their campaign. They were looking for the impact different subject lines could have, not only on open rates but also what customers did once they opened the email – here’s what they tried:
“Your Monsoon Shopping Basket”
“Your [item] from Monsoon”
“Can we help?”
So, how did the results stack up? Which one is your money on?
Well, pulling through the name of an item within their abandoned basket had a really positive impact with customers – a 16% increase in the open rate with a whopping 20% increase in the click through rate, and most importantly a 50% increase in the conversion from send rate.
By contrast the customer service focused “Can we help?” had a negative effect on performance, despite seeing a 5% increase in the open rate we then saw a 2% drop in click through rates and a 1.5% drop in the conversion from send – and all this using the same creatives for all variations!
No prizes for guessing which subject line Monsoon chose to continue with going forward…!
3 The Creative
So you’ve hit your customers with an email at the best possible time and the subject line is going down a storm, but how do you ensure that you get that all-important click to bring them back to the site to complete their order?
Testing the layout, look and feel of your email can help improve both your click through and conversion rates, here are a few things to consider testing:
– How long is your opening text? Does it get straight to the point or does a more lengthy in-depth engaging copy work better with your target audience
– How personalised are the emails? Does the inclusion of a customer’s name within the text improve their engagement?
– How high is the basket within the email? If it falls below the fold it may be worth testing the layout to try and improve interaction with the basket
– Text links vs. Buttons/Images – if a customer has their emails set to automatically block images is it still clear what the email is about? It may be worth testing a hyperlink within the opening text to see if this helps improve the number of clicks. Similarly you may wish to test replacing any call to action buttons with text cells to test interaction.
– Button layout – do your call to action buttons work better near the top of the email or next to the basket? Do they work better on the left hand side or on the right?
Tesco Broadband’s Story
Tesco Broadband wanted to test the layout of their emails to see how a shopping cart focussed email performed against customer service content promoting their USPs.
The SaleCycle design wizz-kids produced a slightly different template to include 5 bullet points highlighting the benefits of switching to Tesco Broadband. The assumption was that a softer, customer service lead approach would work well given the nature of the service the customer was looking to sign up for but the test results were surprising.
Interestingly the open rates and the click through rates were higher on the USP template but the conversion from send dropped by 14% with the conversion from click dropping even further by 16% when compared to the standard short text with shopping cart format.
Testing on this is on-going with the ultimate aim perhaps being a combination of the two styles to compliment both Tesco’s great products and the USPs that make them special.
Takeaways
The key factor of good testing is to only test one variable at a time – so the results can be clearly attributed to that change – and to test for as long as possible to gather a decent pot of data for comparison and analysis.
So why not give it a go, after all your customers really do know best!Marrakech is a very hot city and this 2-day tour offers you the delightful opportunity to hit the beach and take a cool dip in the Atlantic Ocean at the tranquil & picturesque southern seaside resort of Sidi Kaouki and a fishing port of Eassouira.

Brewers 3 Mets 1.
Game Notes.
Next Mets Game
The final game of this much-anticipated four-game set takes place at 7:10 PM on Thursday night. Dillon Gee goes against Chris Narveson.
Guess he failed in his mission.
Funny thing about this team is, nothing really changes…….offensive struggles, pitchers who routinely contribute to pathetic hit totals, weekly (sometimes nightly) injuries or re-aggravations of old ones.
I haven’t wasted my time on this bunch in awhile now, but in turning the game on for 5 minutes the other night — I noticed NICK EVANS in CF. Why, you ask?
…….because Beltran’s hurt yet again.
Last night, Evans left the game himself with a shoulder injury — MRI to follow today.
Why bother torturing yourself over a horrible baseball team…….that’s my battle right now. I’m on the verge of becoming “that guy” — who falls way out of touch with a team he doesn’t need to invest alot of time or $$ in.
It’s a shame, really. two. One is a short story by Benedict Patrick, a friend and a fantasy author I admire greatly for his folklore-inspired Yarnsworld series. The other is by Stephen King, a novella originally written exclusively for the Kindle. Both together, these reads are a little over a hundred pages — the perfect length to read on a busy Monday evening, afternoon, or whenever you’ve got the freedom to do so. Let’s talk about each of them in turn:
“And They Were Never Heard From Again” by Benedict Patrick
The Magpie King’s Forest was one of my favourite new places to inhabit last year, when I first came across Benedict’s work. It’s a mysterious place, dangerous during day and deadly at night, the Forest still unclaimed by the human villagers who live in its reaches. I’ve had my share of exploration of its great and dark confines, and yet have hungered for more over the past few months. Once Benedict Patrick gets in your head, you see, it’s difficult not to hunger after more knowledge of the Forest’s denizens of the night.
But what is a monster of the night without a pair of humans to horrify and appall? The unlucky protagonists of this story are two brothers, one younger and the other older — as these stories tend to go — by the names of Tad and Felton. Felton drags his younger brother to another village for just about the most teenage reason you could think of, and after a series of unfortunate events, the two end up far, far away from the safety of home after darkness falls down on the forest.
What follows, I won’t spoil — but this was the kind of story that questions the power of storytelling and the collective subconscious in a way eerily reminiscent of my favourite work of Neil Gaiman.
The best part? It’s completely, absolutely, unreservedly free, this story. That’s right. $0.00. I’d grab it if I were you. If you’ve never experienced the world, you might just fall in love with it. My score for “And They Were Never Heard From Again” is 5/5.
“UR” by Stephen King
When I opened this on my Kindle on accident a few days ago, I did not expect to come across a very solid, enjoyable 61-page novella that was also tied to Stephen King’s “The Dark Tower” series, one of my most beloved meta series.
“UR” does all the things Stephen King’s best novels do. It presents a relatable, likable protagonist with very human flaws — in English Lit professor Wesley’s case, a sort of childish spite — and an event that sees said protagonist’s grasp on reality begin to slip, pushing him towards a questioning of reality as he knows it.
It’s incredible how much I grew to care about Wesley in the span of these sixty pages. The mark of good writing, and King’s writing in particular — the man can make you care about anything and everything in just a few pages, and then force you to bitter tears. I’m looking at you, “The Stand.”
It’s a simple enough story — Wesley is looking for a way to show university colleague and his ex, Ellen, that she’s wrong about him, and so buys a Kindle. This used to be in the very earliest day of Kindle, kids, when you only had the one variable; it came in white, didn’t have touch-screen or LED lights, and was generally a somewhat bulkier and worse device than some of its competitors — but it did have all of Amazon’s considerable catalogue of e-books, which crowned it King of the e-reader market. History lesson over!
At any rate, Wesley gets a pink Kindle, which at first he doesn’t at all mind — he hasn’t done too much research, after all, it was more of an impulse purchase on the advice of one of his pupils, “the Henderson kid” who plays an important role in the novel’s interpretation of “The Three Stooges”. Ha-ha, my reference game is strong today!
At any rate, it’s not the colour that’s the strangest thing about the Kindle — it’s the fact that its experimental features allow the reader to access the works of writers like Ernest Hemingway and William Shakespeare; only, Wesley discovers works never written by these authors. Works that are so obviously written by these authors that to deny their authorship would be madness, greater even than accepting the impossibility of the small pink device being able to tap into the virtual libraries of alternate realities. I’ll say no more, but let’s just leave it at this: there are other, more impressive features this pink Kindle possesses.
What surprised me was the ending. It could’ve gone several kinds of wrong, but unlike in, say, “Pet Sematary” or even “The Dark Tower” itself, King decides to give us readers a break…mostly.
I will say, if I ever see a pink Kindle delivered to my door by mistake, I’d like to think I would squash it with the heel of my boot…but I have the gnawing doubt that I’ll pick it up and sign up for the experimental “UR” features, instead.
My score of “UR” by Stephen King, is…5 stars! Again!
A fine day to review titles, I reckon. Not that I’m complaining. If they weren’t good, I’d be a sad lad! At any rate, thank you for following along! As always, more is soon to come!December 4, 2017

While this is the best path to take, you need to understand that it comes with its own set of hassles. Because of these flaws and challenges, buying a business requires a strong-willed person. If you are the kind of person who gives up quickly, then this might not be the thing for you.
Regardless of how well-structured the business may seem, you need to be sure of what you are getting yourself into. This can be done by fixating on even the smallest details concerning the company from the seller regarding its operations, success, failures, and finances. Below is a checklist of everything you should review when performing due diligence on the business to ensure that you are making the right decision.
Business certification
The first thing to check is the business permits and licenses. This shows if it is legal and if you are certified to run it. If you are about to take over as the chief executive officer, you have to ensure that the current owner has not broken any licensing law. Most business sectors such as childcare, food processing or health industries require you to have a valid permit, and you, therefore, do not want to leave anything to chance. This is especially important if you are operation in a local area. For example, if you are looking for a business for sale in Los Angeles, make sure that the business is properly accredited to operate in California and is following all state and city laws in regards to the industry it is operating in. .
Certificate of good conduct
Business success is all a result of goodwill. This is the only way people are going to trust you and your services. One of the benefits of buying an already existing business is that you will avoid the trouble of trying to build a reputation. This is one of the biggest causes of startup failures, especially in the early stages. You cannot keep on with a business if you have no customers. For this reason, it is wise to ensure that you are buying into a well-regarded business since there is a likelihood that people will continue shopping with you even after the current owner is gone.
Consider the zoning laws
Avoid trouble by checking with your local laws to ensure that the business that you are about to inherit has not violated any laws or restrictions. These include the zoning laws whereby some localities do not allow for mixed commercial and residential zoning, especially for sensitive businesses such as nightclubs and bars which are mostly restricted from residential areas. It is advisable to do some homework on this to avoid later mix-ups.
Consider environmental rules and regulations
Has the business been following the local and states environmental regulations? You do not want to inherit ill conduct. For example, you do not want to sign a deal with businesses that have been exposing harmful chemicals to the environment and have at times gotten into loggerheads with authority. This may sound like a minor aspect, but it is of high importance as it could affect your business reputation.
Leases and other contracts
Another benefit that comes with buying an already existing business it that the company comes with all everything already set up. These include the premises and equipment. At some point, you may wish to lease out the equipment. However, you have to ensure that you have the rights to do so by looking at the contracts and legal documents needed to carry out the activity. Check any agreements that the current owner may have made with the customers and vendors and ensure that the revenue sources are well distributed.
Financial status
This is arguably the most important thing you need to look at. Before entering into a purchase agreement, make sure that you examine the business’s financials for the past few years. These include its balance sheet, sales records, cash flow statement, tax returns, account payables and advertising costs, among other things. These will highly determine if you are about to enter into a profitable investment or you are about to make the worst mistake of a lifetime. The business does not have to be currently profitable, but analyzing its income stream should give you a clear idea of what to expect.
When looking for a business for sale,, it is advisable that you look for different options before landing on the best. Performing due diligence on several businesses will help you to eventually get what you are looking for and ensure that you get into the agreement armed with all of the right informations. Do not make hasty decisions, as they could create a lifetime of loss and regret.Season 1 Contains 34 episodes

THE decision to award the late Sir Roland Symonette with National Hero honours was branded as “bad,” “inexplicable” and “unlawful” by PLP Chairman Senator Fred Mitchell, who on Friday condemned Prime Minister Dr Hubert Minnis for his defence of the move.
In a statement circulated by the Official Opposition Friday, Mr Mitchell said the Prime Minister’s recent rebuke of the PLP, where he seemed to agree the party is playing the race card in its argument against the appointment of Sir Roland, signalled a “new low.”
Mr Mitchell, the Opposition’s appointment to the National Honours Committee, contended the Prime Minister’s actions are “ the last refuge of a scoundrel,” insisting that Dr Minnis “has lost the argument” and now “has to go there.”
Dr Minnis, in speaking to reporters on the issue Thursday, said it would “appear” the PLP was playing the race card.
Seeming to brush the entire dispute aside, Dr Minnis said: “I don’t go down that road. We must move beyond colours. So, I don’t see people like that.”
Responding on Friday, Mr Mitchell said the PLP has never made its opposition on the matter racial.
Mr Mitchell argued: “First, as far as we know Roland Symonette was a man with African ancestry.”

- No 46%
541 total votes.
Expounding on the point, he said: “So to quote the Deputy Prime Minister Peter Turnquest when he was accused of being racist in tax policy, the PLP can’t be racist talking about Roland Symonette since we who have voiced objections are talking about a man who shares our common African ancestry.”
Mr Mitchell also claimed that there are many other “white men” who could qualify for the honour, but were passed over by the selection committee.
“This is not about race,” Mr Mitchell said. “This is about the acts of a man who opposed the creation of the Commonwealth of The Bahamas.”
According to the former Fox Hill MP, much of Sir Roland’s political will and effort was used up in his opposition of many of the founding tenets of the Bahamas.
“He opposed majority rule,” Mr Mitchell said.
“He opposed the lowering of the vote to 18.
“He opposed the vote for women.
“He opposed the implementation of the labour and social security systems.
“He opposed the fair drawing of boundaries.
“He opposed independence.
“Every step of the way he did not want this to be a nation,” he added.
Mr Mitchell continued: “A National Hero is the hero of a nation. Sir Roland Symonette did not want this nation. He gave aid and comfort to a group that wanted to break up the nation. Now he is being rewarded as a hero of that nation.”
“Dr Minnis has certainly taken leave of his senses and good judgment,” he said.
Meanwhile, in a second statement released on Friday Mr Mitchell also condemned recent comments by Free National Movement Chairman Carl Culmer on the issue, imploring his political counterpart to read a copy of Harriet Beecher Stowe’s slavery novel ‘Uncle Tom's Cabin.’
In the statement, Mr Mitchell asserted that Mr Culmer continues to say, “dumber and dumber things.”
Referring to claims by Mr Culmer, where he accused the PLP of oppressing generations of black Bahamians through its political ploys and practices, Mr Mitchell said if there was a law against spreading misinformation - Mr Culmer would now be in prison.
“This is a classic example of what is known as Uncle Tomism,” Mr Mitchell said. “That means you blame the slaves for being in their condition and you get one of their own to say so.”
He continued: “How could a modern Bahamian, presumably educated in our country as a result of the policies of the PLP; whose island elected representatives of the PLP to take the country into independence; who benefitted from a senior job in a public corporation as a result of PLP policies; who lives in a free nation because of what the PLP did; whose very own FNM leaders were once PLP, speak such total and complete nonsense.”
“Instead of seeking to fix Grand Bahama with five FNM MPs and three Senators, he is spinning falsehoods.
“Mr Culmer should go sit in the graveyard in Savannah Sound and weep for his sins,” he concluded.
The first recipients of the country’s National Honours were announced on Independence Day, with the top honour of the Order of National Hero awarded posthumously to Sir Lynden Pindling, Sir Milo Butler and Sir Cecil Wallace-Whitfield and Sir Roland.
The announcement, specifically the selection of Sir Roland, has led to national debate over the criteria for selection, with scores of political, religious and national figures using their respective platforms to either condemn or back the choice.
On Thursday, retired Bishop Simeon Hall called for a stop to the debate, which he called .”
Additionally, Bishop Hall called on the country to recognise that, just as Sir Roland did, many of the country’s founding fathers had “a dark-side.”
However, he said despite their alleged negative acts; “the good they did outweighed the bad.”
And added Bishop Hall: “Some of our black leaders had their own graveyards, figuratively speaking.”

An award is reflective of the sum total of a person's life, not just where he stood at a pivotal moment in history. Yes there were people on both sides of the nationhood debate. My own father did not feel the time was right for the Bahamas to become an independent nation. However, once the Bahamas became independent, there was no one in this country that a more proud Bahamian than my dad. He went on to become a living, walking, breathing encyclopedia and history book of the Bahamas. By the way, Sir Roland Symonette was a great friend to my dad. My dad could walk into any one of his stores--I remember he sold, among other things, Electrolux refrigerators--and walk out with anything he needed. Of course he would always pay on terms. I can still remember my dad, a poor farmer and fisherman from the out island sitting in Sir Roland Symonette's office laughing and talking for hours. To him, he was not a white Bahamian and my dad, a black Bahamian. They were just two proud Bahamian men who, in their own way, loved their country and wanted to do whatever to help it succeed. If we were to judge politicians for having changed their minds on issues, they would all be branded as scoundrels. Sir Roland Symonette deserves the highest honor for his many contributions to Bahamian society. Apart from injecting race into this issue our Bahamian politicians of today need to stop being "small" and narrowminded.

Minnis has taken note of how easy it was for him to divert the public's attention away from his decision to increase VAT by 60%. Most of you posting to The Tribune website will have your attention similarly diverted away from the much more serious issues of the day when Minnis decides it's a good time to play his next race card - PUTTING SIR ROLAND'S FACE ON OUR ONE HUNDRED DOLLAR BANK NOTE!
And by the way, how many of you noticed that nearly all of those 'honoured' were or are politicians? Yes, indeed, Minnis truly believes only the 'politically elite ruling class' in our society are deserving of a 'national honour'. Here we have clear proof that Minnis is little different from Pindling, Ingraham and Christie. The rest of us plebes are only good for paying the taxes that allow Minnis and his elite political friends and their family members to live and travel like British Royalty. What a cruel joke on the Bahamian people!

I read somewhere that the vote in the House of Assembly on independence was unanimous, which meant that Pop voted for it.So if he was against it initially,as were many other Bahamians, of all colour i might add, then it shows his love of country, since he saw that was the way it was going, he was prepared to go along and give it his best shot to make it work. We must remember that Sir Milo approached him about starting a bank that would give black Bahamians a"fairer shake" than the others big banks at the time and so Pop started Commonwealth Bank, offering Sir Milo shares in it, which made their two families the biggest shareholders.I do not think that Sir Milo was the only one that he could have asked to join him but that was Pop. A late friend from Exuma told me that his father had died, owing Pop a lot of money ,which made his mother a "nervous wreck",because she had no way of repaying it.Pop came to the funeral, offered his condolences and afterwards came to their house ,sat down in the living, pulled out a handful of receipts and said",Mrs. Ferguson , you know your husband owed me a lot of money",then after tearing them up,he again said,"Your husband is gone and so are the bills,don't let anyone come to you and say that i sent them to collect some money from you!" He said that after consoling his mother who was still crying , Pop told her that she knew how to contact him if she needed anything, wished them well and left for Nassau.

Ma Comrades, this conversation is not about how much Pop loved his country, his kindness, how much he contributed his Homeland - nor should it be about his financial generosity. ---- all have been acknowledged with few challengers.......it is solely about Pop's or any others elevation Hero status coming from ranks politicians.

What no one has discussed is that there is really NO differences between the social and political elitism attached to these "Bahamian" titles as compared to the British titles .......... The PM used to dole out the foreign awards ....... and he is doling out the local awards.
If these were honestly decided upon by a non-partisan independent Honours Committee, many of those names on there would not really be on there ........ To make them worthwhile, no more than three awards per Merit, Distinction, Bahamas categories should be given out each year ....... and ONE Nation and Hero named every THREE years.
We are just throwing our "pearls to swine".

Ma Comrades, sometimes you just need to own things, and say them out loud. From its inception the red shirts as a party have whitewashed their true identity. They are exactly as Minnis comes across.... doubling down Pop's elevation is not what they should be wanting to own 45 years after Independence and 50 years after Majority Rule. Might explain why they're rattling at their mandate's governing ribs cage.

If you could honor Pop Symonette with he rum running record, then honor Sebas Bastian and Craig Flowers with their numbers racket and Austin ‘King Snake ‘ Knowles and Samuel ‘Ninety ‘ Knowles with the same honors. None did no more than the other. Minnis it is your puppet masters that are playing the race card and NOT the PLP! And I dare you (or them) to prove me wrong!

John you are right. Making this about black and "Bahamian" white is a distraction. The man was a rum runner, opposed nationhood, somehow owned vast swaths of Nassau from Coconut grove to South Beach. Rum running is the same as drug running, is the same as illegal numbers - etc. Based on this logic Sebas and Flowers are nationaI heroes too- especially since they seem to do much more than than the Symonettes ever did. I want the decision makers to list the contributions these men made to the development of a modern Bahamas. Exemplary things that no one can argue. Whether they were nice people and gave a hand out here or there means absolutely nothing to me. I think we will find that none are truly deserving. Just because you decree- don't make it so.

GreenTeat is woefully ignorant, stupid, or just likes posting lies. Rum Running cannot be compared to Drug smuggling. Rum Running by Bahamians, or British as they then were, was quite legal and broke no laws of the land. Drug smuggling however is illegal. D- education at work or the usual PLP lies being generated.

And one more thing- I think those women who helped get out the vote in 1967 should have been named the first national heroes. I am embarrassed to say I can't remember their names but a Ms. Bethel made a movie about them a few years ago that I saw. Now that story gave me immense pride in the country . I think that should be the criteria for national hero- selfless acts of bravery/courage/vision that moved the country forward. The national heroes CAN'T be politicians. Besides Edmund Moxey- few have attempted anything on a national scale intended to enrich the soul of our people. The so called Westminster system they were throwing around a few weeks ago, erases that possibility. And frankly after 45 years 8billion in debt, social decay, violence, environmental degradation, intense dumbing down of the population and a lack of national standards and accountability- not a single politician can honestly be called a national hero- white or black.

Ma Comrades, like so much other things from we past - the Rum Running history of Pop Symonette and others have been quietly brushed aside. The always contentious relationship between Pop Symonette and Sir Stafford Sands - along with Pop's gained wealth gained through Rum Running would makes interesting case study in itself. There is no denying that without Pop and Sir Stafford appearing on the local scene, the colony of islands may never have become the crown jewel of the Caribbean. Estimates in the day has it that at anytime there were as much as "Ten Million Dollars’ worth of whisky" stored in those rickety old liquor shanties on Bay Street. The profits that poured out them bottles whisky did well for the bank balances one Pop's Roland Theodore Symonette. I keep preaching that we may need return our past ways to save these hereto colony of islands from itself and its $8 BILLION debt load. Talk has it that Pop's Rum Running loot was so cash flow lucrative that he boy Brent - still be countin’ he Pop's gold... all I might add was "legally lawful" under colony islands British Law - Pop's even had agents in London, England.

October 31st, 2011
The son of a friend of ours is working as a doctor in a small hospital in South Africa. He’s writing a blog that gives a vivid impression of what it’s like to be living and working there – the tragedy and the beauty of it too. He starts off:
Just for a little orientation: I am working as a “Level 1 Medical Officer” at the Holy Cross Hospital, which is 20km outside the small and chaotic town of Flagstaff in the Eastern Cape Province. We’re situated about 40km from the coast, referred to locally as “the wild coast” for its sheer beauty and isolation. Holy Cross was set up in 1923 by some philanthropic missionaries. In the past decade it has undergone a massive rebuild and looks very modern and glam. Unfortunately, for what is has in glitz, it lacks in numbers of doctors and well trained clinical staff. The hospital has about 450 beds, but only around 250 to 300 are currently active…
He then zooms in to describe life working there, finishing his first post by saying:
It’s not all chaos and pandemonium though. One of the most enchanting aspects of working here is the singing. Most mornings and occasionally at lunchtime you’ll see and hear the hospital staff standing around and singing gospel anthems. Now, maybe they should be attending to their clinical/clerical/whatever duties, but oh it is lovely and gives some light to the bedlam. For example, while there was a lull in casualty last Saturday evening the nurses all started singing. For the few minutes that it lasted, it gave me time to reflect on the day and take in all that had shot past. Luckily, there was an abscence of gun shot wounds that evening.
I’m not working this weekend, so maybe I’ll be able to explore some of the local surroundings.
Just one more thing, in answer to the statement that so many people posed before I left: “Wow, that’ll be an amazing experience “– I think you were right, it’s already turning out to be that. So, do you want to have an “amazing experience” too? As I mentioned earlier, the Holy Cross is in desperate need of more doctors, dentists, physios, dieticians, OT’s. Get involved and go tell the people at AHP (African Health Placements) that you want a job here… Read more
Sounds very much like “home” to me Phillip. Great that Dom seems to be keeping perspective and his sense of appreciation and I wish him all the best. Africa is indeed not for sissies and a great adventure for the worthy.Brave medical Doctor,...

After veterinary school, Jim trained as a veterinary surgeon, first with an internship at the University of Georgia, then in a surgery residency at Michigan State University. He was board certified in veterinary surgery by the American College of Veterinary Surgeons in 1991.
Jim spent most of his career as a surgeon in university veterinary referral hospitals at Auburn University and then at Ohio State University, where he spent his time off clinics running research programs.

And when it comes to long-range plans, the proposition has been in the works for years, a situation capped by the Waldo Canyon fire that forced emergency service workers to operate from an inadequate structure in their effort to save Ute Pass communities.
Of all the local issues facing voters in the next week, 4A, a proposal to finance a new fire station for the Green Mountain Falls/Chipita Park Fire Protection District, hasn’t received as much attention as the more controversial ballot issues, such as a proposition to end term limits or develop major broadband initiatives.
However, last week leaders of the Green Mountain Falls/Chipita Park Fire Protection District made a final pitch for their plan at a public meeting at the old fire station, a deteriorating building they want to replace and sell off. They are asking voters the right to incur $.3.5 million in debt and to increase taxes annually by $308,000 for constructing a new fire station next to the GMF Town Hall that would establish a full-time department hub.
If successful, it would mark the first tax increase plan of the fire protection district that handles about 1,600 properties. District residents also would reap the benefits of better protection and a fire station that would more than double the limited room they now have with a 60-year-old building located in a flood plain area.
Fire district leaders contend that time isn’t on their side. “The longer we wait, the more expensive and harder this will become to do,” said board member Gary Florence. He also contended that the district may lose potential grant opportunities and have to contend with higher land values.
The district leaders realize they face a tough challenge this November, with a bombardment of ballot propositions.
“The ballot is huge,” admitted Rich Bowman, president of the fire district board. He and other fire district leaders wished they could have garnered a better spot on the ballot for their issue.
But during a question and answer format last week, the district leaders stated they have been developing plans for a new station for a number of years. “A lot of time has gone into this,” added board member Sandy Wupper. In the last few years, several possible deals fell through, including a proposition to use part of the Joyland Church facilities.
“This is really a long-range plan for the future. We hope the citizens see it that way,” explained Bowman.
If voters give them the okay, district leaders believe they could garner more grants from state and federal agencies, and possibly lower their debt obligations.
During last week’s forum, district leaders weren’t shy about unveiling horror stories pertaining to their current station that doesn’t meet standards of the American Disability Act and is pelted with rain waters during the summer, causing occasional flooding. The building, used during the Waldo Canyon fire as an emergency site for fire fighters and law enforcement, was declared as completely inadequate for food service, sanitation and communications.
Bowman said the building worked okay, when the agency mainly just responded to fire calls. But now, the agency, considered one of the most successful nearly all-volunteer-fire departments in the region, responds to a far majority of medical assistance calls, especially in the summer. They grapple with close to 300 calls on an annual basis.
The new proposition, however, won’t fund any new equipment. “We don’t need any new equipment,” said Florence. At the forum, meeting participants got a chance to view the district’s arsenal of tankers and fire trucks in detail. Their current equipment clearly got the thumbs-up by the forum attendees.
“We got everything we need in our plan,” stressed Bowman.
Push for new station
The pinnacle of this new plan hinges on a new station that would encompass a 7,500 to 9,000 square-foot area, approximately double what it has with its current station.
More importantly, the station would feature a living quarters for the agency, permitting a 24/7 operation. It also would come equipped with washing machines and dryers and provide much better access for their equipment.
And with its location on land behind the current GMF Town Hall, it could serve as an emergency operation center for the lower Ute Pass. If the issue gets voter approval, the new station could be constructed by the end of 2017 or early 2018, according to Bowman.
A handful of meeting participants, including new GMF Town Manager John Pick, reacted positively to the plan at last week’s forum.
The major obstacle facing the district deals with the proposed tax increase, which would double the current fire district mill levy. Tax increases aren’t viewed favorably in the Pikes Peak region. But in GMF and the lower Ute Pass, they have fared better than Teller County historically. Most people voting on 4A issue reside in the western edge of El Paso County, with a small number of voters in Teller County.
But district leaders say the tax plan as a vital starting point in their long-range plans for a full-time agency.
Plus, if the issue passes, the district would sell its current main station on Ute Pass Avenue and another satellite facility in Chipita Park.
District leaders still aren’t sure of their chances on Nov. 8, as tax issues are always tricky propositions. But on the upside, no public comments have been filed against their tax plan.Dear Brides-To-Be,

Body Lift Procedure Steps San Francisco
The Body Lift Procedure Steps start with anesthesia that may be administered intravenously or as general anesthesia. The incision in a body lift is commonly made in what is known as a bikini pattern where the abdomen, waist, thighs, buttocks and groin are all tightened and lifted in one fell swoop. The last step, if this is the only procedure being performed at this time (sometimes the body lift is performed in combination with Liposuction if there is stubborn fat in the area as well) is closing the incision through the use of sutures, tapes, or skin adhesives.
Results from a Body Lift procedure are visible almost immediately, though your body will continue to heal and adjust over time. If you are interested in learning more about the body lift procedure and recovery process, and to find out if you may be a good candidate for the procedure, contact our office to schedule your confidential consultation with Dr. Anthony today.

(NASDAQ:GPRO)’s stock continued to sink in the market on Monday trading session, going down by 5.15% to close the day at a low of $36.84. The drop in the market comes as Barron’s posted a cautious article about the company, highlighting that the post-IPO thrill was finally over for the company. Barron’s, Phil Roosevelt, in an interview on Fox Business, said that the company has gone out of control since its IPO period where it was trading at high margins; Johnson Controls Inc. (NYSE:JCI)’s, on the other hand, continues to soar in the market after an article from Barron’s.
“This is a stock that has gone out of control since its IPO a month ago it’s up 60%, trades at 80 or so times earnings. It is trading as if it has no competitor, and it is, in fact, facing serious competitors” said Mr. Roosevelt.
During its initial offering price in the IPO, the company’s stock rose to a high of $48 but has since dropped and is trading at the mid-$30 range suggesting something is not well in the company. Mr. Roosevelt was of the opinion that the company’s troubles are not yet over as competition continues to stream in.
“The competition is on the way, people may not know it, but it is on the way. Right now the Tour De France they have cameras on the Bike, but they are not GoPro,” said Mr. Roosevelt. Loosing appeal on a massive event like the Tour De France also highlights concerns about the company’s prospects going forward, especially on its camera division.
Barron’s seem to be having an effect in the market if events of the recent days are to go-by. The company had an article about Johnson Controls Inc. (NYSE:JCI) of which its stock is currently high in the market. Roosevelt believes that Johnson being a conglomerate in managing property could go high by up to 25% in the year if it can
maintain the current momentum.

By Heather Cox
But he said to me, “My grace is sufficient for you, for my power is made perfect in weakness."
Therefore I will boast all the more gladly about my weaknesses, so that Christ’s power may rest on me. 2 Corinthians 12:9
I’ve recently been reading short biographies of missionaries of women like Amy Carmichael and Gladys Alward. It’s interesting to peer inside another person’s life and see how she walked with God, taking into consideration her personal life circumstances, her calling and her gifting. Most of the time, when I read these stories, I am inspired to walk closer to my God and to step out and serve Him more.
These were women who left everything they knew to be comfortable, worked harder than anyone I’ve ever known, and counted it a joy to serve the Lord in all they did. Gladys worked days and nights through war torn areas, rescuing children and even boldly stopping a prison riot because she was willing to follow God wherever He led. Amy took one child at a time away from temples in India until she had created a family of over a hundred whose highest goal was to love the Lord and each other. What is it that made them so different from the ordinary Christian? These ladies died to selfishness.
First of all, neither woman seemed to put much stock in what everyone else thought they should be doing. Gladys was told she wasn’t fit for missions for multiple reasons – namely lack of education. But, she didn’t let that stop her. Amy was often criticized for the way that she cloistered her “family” inside a wall and protected them from the world. She ignored their words because she was confident that she was doing what God had told her to do.
How often have I let my weaknesses hold me back?
“I’m not good enough at that ministry or job. I shouldn’t even pursue it.”
Really, what I’m thinking is that it might just be too hard. Where did God say we weren’t supposed to do things that were difficult? As a matter of fact, if He only called us to do things that were easy, why did He say “My strength is perfect in your weakness”? ( 2 Corinthians 12:9)
Am I putting more stock in what other people think I should be doing than in what God is calling me to?
Are my decisions based upon what others might wonder about me?
Am I easily swayed into changing my mind or behavior because I’m concerned about someone’s opinion of me?
The only opinion I should be seeking is God’s. I want to please Him in all I do, and though I may still seek human advice, it’s God’s calling that I will follow. Are my ears open to hear His voice above all the racket of the world?
I think this attitude of serving God and toiling night and day for His pleasure sets apart some of these women of the past. Could it set me apart too? Could I be heartily committed to God’s causes, not fearing the difficult labor or the criticism of others?
Is God calling you to step out and follow Him above the noise of everyone else’s opinions and die to selfishness giving Him all of your days?

"Burning In My Soul" by Brett YounkerFAMU NPHC hosts annual step show
Photo courtesy of Jefferson Student Union and Activities
Florida A&M University’s Greeks hosted their annual National Pan-Hellenic Council Greek Step Show for homecoming. Students, alumni and faculty filled Al Lawson and as they waited for the show to start.
This is the first time in over a decade that all nine sororities and fraternities have been active on FAMUs campus. Only seven organizations actually partook in performing during the step show however.
The ladies of Zeta Phi Beta opened up the show with a high-energy routine that showcased the talents of the sorority. They were then followed by the men of Omega Psi Phi, Fraternity Inc. who themed their performance around Jimmy Neutron, which was in remembrance of their line brother, Alfred Motlow III.
Following this was a performance from Iota Phi Theta. The women of Delta Sigma Theta made a big return with a show-stopping performance that left the crowd on their feet. Then, Kappa Alpha Psi performed, followed by their “sisters” of Sigma Gamma Rho. Lastly, Alpha Phi Alpha closed out the show with a Drumline themed performanced.
Alumna Flo’Nesha Davis, alumna, said that she was glad to see that the turnout from last year had increased drastically.
“This was my first homecoming as a alumni and it felt good to see all of the Greeks back on the yard. I really enjoyed all of the performances that the organizations put on,” Davis said. “I wish I would have had this experience during my undergraduate years, but I am glad that the new group of Rattlers get to enjoy the show.”
While old Rattlers enjoyed the show, new freshmen students got to experience the NPHC step show for the first time.
Winslyn Parrish, a first-year pre nursing student, talked about her experience with attending the step-show.
“It was pretty cool and it was pretty much how I expected it to be. It was kind of hard for me to pick a favorite performance because all of them performed well. Many of them had a lot of energy that lasted throughout the performance which made it very fun to watch,” Parrish said.
The night ended with Delta Sigma Theta and Alpha Phi Alpha taking home the first place trophies.
This is the second year in the row the Alphas have won the show for the fraternity category.
Alicia Jones, a member of the Rattler community and alumna said that coming to the step show is one of her favorite things to do during the homecoming festivities.
“I enjoy seeing what the students at the university are doing and to just see what they are capable of makes me enjoy the show even more. It reminds me of my days in college and how much things have not changed since then,” Jones said.
The results of the placement of the other organizations were sent out to the university via email.

Apart from the above, if you open the details panel of a ship (bottom left side), you see icons for all weapons, and below them the current/basic number (so 1/3 Lance Turrets would mean 2 are destroyed). Also mouseovering the icons will show you current range.
After the changes to boarding hoes live, this will already be handled and no additional delay is needed.
The delay the OP would like to see will already be implemented, just not between hulking and scuttle, but between boarding and hulking.
The over-time nature of boarding will give you time to start moving away before the ship is hulked, thrus making it easier to dodge the scuttle.Make an Appointment

Sinn Féin South Antrim MLA, Declan Kearney has made an urgent appeal for caution by all road users on local roads over the Christmas period.
Speaking after meeting with senior Antrim and Newtownabbey PSNI commanders yesterday, Mr Kearney said,
"As part of my regular engagement with senior PSNI commanders, I have continued to highlight rural road safety concerns in the South Antrim area.
"This has resulted in raising rural road safety awareness and major road safety improvements especially in the Moneyglass and Creggan areas, where the PSNI and Transport NI have now introduced important speed reduction measures and are also considering additional options.
"During my most recent meeting yesterday, I received an update on continuing road safety measures across the constituency. This included a report on the success of the PSNI's recent random breath test initiative.
"I was pleased to hear that the vast majority of drivers tested to date have provided negative results, indicating a growing awareness about the dangers of drink driving.
"However, I do remain concerned about drivers travelling at speed in some areas and without due regard for road conditions, or other road users. This includes complaints from local constituents of young drivers behaving recklessly on the roads around Crumlin. I observed this problem myself last Tuesday night while on constituency business.
“During my meeting with the local police management I requested additional high visibility speed detection operations around the Crumlin, Parkgate/Doagh, Randalstown/Creggan, and Toome/Moneyglass areas over the next few weeks. Motorists should note that excessive and illegal speeding can be detected for distances of up to a half a mile.
"I am advising drivers to exercise extra caution on the roads, particularly over this Christmas period. There has already been extreme weather and associated dangerous driving conditions all across South Antrim.
"I am making a special appeal for everyone to drive with care, and respect for other road users during this Christmas holiday season. A moment's recklessness, or those few minutes of speed to try and to save time on a journey can so easily turn an otherwise enjoyable time with friends and family into tragedy, and a lifetime of regret."

Product Code: 4075.In the years since the financial crisis of 2008, corporate scandals have become both more common and more challenging to resolve. The scrutiny from regulators, news media, and the public is relentless and can last for years. Even when a scandal has finally receded into history, tomorrow’s headlines can bring more damning allegations, reopening old wounds and calling into question the thoroughness and efficacy of past remedial efforts. Not an enviable place for a leader to be in.
Many crises begin when an allegation of misconduct is exposed to the public, whether by a whistle-blower, a media exposé, a police raid on company offices, or an investigation announcement by law enforcement. The immediate damage can be considerable, but becomes far worse by the revelation that leaders within the organization knew about the misconduct and condoned (or even concealed) it. The company’s share price, or enterprise value, can fall dramatically due to the high degree of uncertainty and risk that may even threaten the very survival of the organization in its current form.
Organizations that are well prepared to detect and address misconduct early are far less likely to find themselves in crisis situations over which they have lost control. They have the tools to undertake an internal investigation, cooperate with law enforcement, and swiftly take any necessary action to move the organization from rocky waters to stable ground.
Reflecting on my experience assisting organizations recover from ethical crises, I would advise leaders to take a long-term view—using the crisis as a catalyst for reform—and think about the recovery process as a progression that includes the following steps:
1. Recognize you’re in a crisis, not just a one-day news blip. Understand that there has been a rupture in the foundation of trust that you maintain with your stakeholders. At this stage, the board likely needs to take over the direction of the organization’s response, sending the message that the matter will be accorded the highest priority, and addressed independently and transparently. It is important at this point to balance a sense of urgency with the patience to truly understand the crisis. Don’t panic and fumble the response by giving into the pressure to be seen doing something.
2. Gather all the facts about the allegation(s). This requires a thorough and robust investigation of adequate scope, conducted by independent counsel under the direction of the board. Don’t unduly limit the resources or scope of the inquiry out of fear of what you might find; there is a good chance the misconduct was more pervasive than it appeared at first glance, and was not limited to just a few “bad apples.”
3. Take remedial measures to correct the issues detected in investigations, overseen by the board but largely executed by senior management. These may include immediate changes to personnel, internal controls, training, and other areas, and are intended to stop a pattern of misconduct. It also involves drafting a comprehensive roadmap for a stronger and more sustainable organization. Leaders need to commit to fixing what is not working and communicate this commitment throughout the organization.
4. Bring closure to any regulatory and prosecutorial matters through some form of settlement arrangement, with particular attention given to criminal inquiries or those that could lead to debarment. The legalities involved behind a scandal need to be considered from day one but they take time to resolve. A settlement should be viewed as an opportunity to build stakeholder confidence and strengthen the company against future crises rather than an end unto itself.
5. Strengthen organizational structures to prevent, detect, and respond to misconduct, namely through the development of a strong corporate ethics and compliance program following international good practices. Senior management leads this process, using compliance experts from outside and promoting the changes throughout the organization.
6. Reshape the culture of an organization though new leaders, a renewed focus on integrity, and new incentives for ethical conduct. Without refreshed or renewed leadership (and fresh ideas), it is difficult to turn a crisis into an opportunity.
7. Take a long look at the corporate strategy. Often, in the wake of a crisis, you need to refocus the strategy on core capabilities and priority markets, and shift away from distracting, poorly overseen, or excessively risky markets or projects. This step necessarily requires an engaged board of directors. In some instances, a crisis signals that your business models that were unduly risky or not fully thought through.
Beyond those seven steps, there are some changes to the leadership mindset that can be helpful in expediting the process described above and preventing the recurrence of problems in your company. I call this “recalibrating your sense of leadership.” This entails:
- Being closely attuned to pressures that may be building up within the organization—pressures to perform and to conform, which may result in ethical corner cutting.
- Hearing the messages sent by whistle-blowers and paying close attention to what remains unsaid—at board meetings, site visits, and interactions with key stakeholders. There is a danger in simply hearing what you want to hear.
- Rejecting double standards in accountability. Don’t be blind (or tolerant) towards the unethical actions of high-performing managers. Embrace a zero-tolerance attitude towards misconduct and avoid rationalizing behavior that runs contrary to your organization’s stated values.
Although every crisis is different, I have found that there are reliable milestones that can guide you on the path to remediation and reform. At each one, showing the willingness to confront uncomfortable realities head on can be the difference between success and failure in the long term.

Sky Cooper was born in Australia. He doesn't really have much of an accent though, it's more east coast sounding. That's because he lived in Boston from 3-10. Now he lives in Portland and.Modern trends make it difficult for mature women to stay fashionable especially because they change so frequently. Things can get difficult for the fashion conscious older woman. However, there are ways for you to find nice and trendy cloths that fit your lifestyle and needs without breaking the bank.
Mainstream clothing designers tend to cater to the young and the evidence is in what’s available on the market. But you are young at heart and the everyday blouse and slacks are not cutting it for you because you deserve to feel sexy. So, how can you find that perfect piece of sensual attire when all you see in the mall is skimpy skirts and ripped jeans?
There are very appropriate ways for a woman to look sexy and dress sensual without showing any skin. Sensuality can be shown through the colors and fabric of the cloths. Silk, cashmere, and fur are great examples of this. Colors like red, plum, and champagne make your sexuality pop. Mid-to-high range department stores are great places to shop.
Do not be afraid to show off your full figure if you have one. In fact, men all over are saying that they prefer a fuller woman. Try not to wear bagging clothing or clothing that doesn’t fit properly. Wear makeup in moderate amounts because too much of it only brings out your age. Be natural, bold, and unpredictable. Wear shirts with zippers instead of buttons and skirts that fall just over the knees.
Be just as bold with the accessories you choose. Have different color purses or bags that contrast with your outfit to make it pop. Do not overdo the jewelry just as you do not want to overdo the makeup. However, it’s perfectly fine to express yourself.
Your hairstyle is an area where you can truly express yourself. Don’t hold back anything here. Change styles often to express your mood or to fit what you’re wearing. There’s nothing wrong with adding color or highlights as you wish. You can also make use of extensions and wigs to expand your creativity.
It is understandable how difficult heels can be to walk in and the wear they can have on your feet, so they don’t have to be an everyday or even all day thing, but try to splash a pair in every once in a while. There is nothing more sexy than a woman in heels. Pack a pair of comfortable shoes just like to match your or flats when you wear them so that you can make the easy change when your feet get tired.
Fashion can be difficult for mature women that are still trend conscious. However, there are ways for you to keep up with time while still being true to your nature. Sensuality is not about showing skin, rather it’s in the fabrics and colors you wear. Spice up your hairstyles, wear the occasional heels, apply moderate amounts of makeup, and be expressive with your accessories. These are a few ways for a mature woman to stay fashionable in the modern world.Share Word Search Still a Gorilla!

If you have a higher dose of radiation, your chances of getting side effects are more likely — but if you get too low of a dose of radiation, it won’t be as effective against the cancer and could leave cancer cells alive.
Here are some long-term side effects to be aware of.

Breast Fibrosis
Fibrosis is a term that means a thickening or scarring of connective tissues, and many women naturally have fibroids and simple cysts in their breasts already — they are a common factor in having “dense breasts.” They do not increase breast cancer risk and are not harmful, though they can make detecting breast cancer more difficult because your breasts may feel lumpy or ropey.
However, breast fibrosis can also be long-term side effect of radiotherapy. You may hear your doctor refer to it as breast fibrosis or glandular atrophy, or radiation fibrosis syndrome (RFS). In this case, breast fibrosis is a direct result of radiation damaging your skin’s elasticity. This can make your breasts feels harder or thicker to the touch, and they may visually appear smaller or shrunken as well.
Experiencing high doses of radiation, undergoing radiation while also undergoing chemotherapy, and having underlying collagen vascular disease can increase your risk of breast fibrosis significantly.

Fibrosis usually develops within the first two years after treatment, but in rare cases, it can crop up as much as ten years later. Your breast may start out feeling inflamed or tender, and then gradually harden.
It can also sometimes be mistaken by patients as a new lump or recurrence of the disease, which can be unnecessarily frightening, so reach out to your doctor if you have any concerns.
The good news is that a recent study showed that a combination of vitamin E and a drug called pentoxifylline (PTX) reduced the risk of breast cancer patients developing fibrosis if they underwent radiation therapy, so talk to your doctor about your options.

Pei-Jiun Cheah was stabbed multiple times during an alleged break-in at her home.
The family of a pregnant woman stabbed in Sydney's north have released a statement confirming both mother and child are stable after the "senseless, terrible and random act of violence".
Pei-Jiun Cheah, 33, who is seven months pregnant, was stabbed multiple times in the chest and abdomen during a break-in at her Mt Colah home.
She has undergone multiple surgeries at Royal North Shore Hospital, and is now in a stable condition.
A 14-year-old boy has been arrested and charged with attempted murder. He made no application for bail in court, and it was formally refused by the magistrate.
"This was a senseless, terrible and random act of violence inflicted on a pregnant mother in her own home," said the family in a statement.
"We can confirm that Pei-Jiun is in a stable condition, including the child she is carrying, and is being closely monitored by the excellent doctors and health care professionals at Royal North Shore Hospital."
The family thanked the emergency services, police and medical staff, as well as acknowledging the "brave acts of kindness and care that the neighbourhood of Mt Colah extended to Pei-Jiun, in the short moments after the assault."
Moments after the attack, and bleeding from her wounds, Cheah ran to her neighbour for help.
"She just knocked on our door and said she'd been attacked and 'help me, help me'," her neighbour told Ten Eyewitness News.
Other neighbours said they were "shocked" at the incident.
"We got a lovely community up here in Mt Colah," one said.
"It's nice to know that this community spirit is happening and that people are willing to step into the fray to give you a hand," added another.
A manhunt commenced after the alleged stabbing, but it was the teen suspect's parents who turned their son in after noticing he was injured. The boy, who cannot be named, was kept under police guard in hospital.
Ms Cheah's family did not comment on the suspect, "as the matter is under investigation by the NSW Police Force".
They asked for privacy during the "distressing time".
The boy was remanded in custody after making no application for bail when his matter came before a children's court on Saturday.
He is expected to next appear via video link before a children's court on September 25.Web Feet
{A Bumbershoot Special Feature}
Yesterday, LicMan19, while our boss was away,
I instant messaged you all afternoon, and you
texted me back from your cubicle, shirking our work.
Verses took shape on our screens, as we each added
lines, taking turns, switching meters and fonts as we typed
lines overlapping, both laughing as if we were
drunk. When our boss saw our sloth and distraction, she roared,
livid, and sent us home. Oh, how I miss you, oh,
LicMan19, and your lively and beautiful words.
Eating my dinner alone left me hungry, and
lying alone left me tired but unable to sleep.
All through the night, in my lust inconsolable,
yearning, half-dreaming, I kept checking e-mail in hopes
you would be there, sharing half-dreams of me, every
time disappointed to find only spam. Now I’m wrecked,
thrashed by fatigue, almost dead in my bed. With this
last ounce of vigor, I write you this poem, to express
all that I feel: new desire, and surprise and, yes,
love. Now you know of my ardor, and you must hit reply.
What if you don’t? Well, let’s see. You remember the
day you skipped work and I covered? I’ll tell the big boss.
You’ll be in trouble, my darling, and lots of it!
Laura dedicates this poem to the memory of Aino Paasonen,
beloved teacher of the art of translation and adaptation.

Players will return to the team’s facility to continue organized team activities on Monday., Memorial Day, Military, Twitter, Broncos Buzz"Dear friends, colleagues, and citizens of the Internet:
We’re a young community and eager to win the future – not just disrupt some old irritating players, but actually win the future. In short, to succeed, we need a social dispute resolution mechanism that allows us to solve a situation where two of us disagree.
Different organisations have different ways of resolving this. They usually involve telling people what they cannot do, must do, may do and of course, voting. All of this is slowing a movement and lowering morale and energy. It just about sucks donkey balls.
We’re a dis-organization and what we are trying to build is a meta-community.
We don’t believe in voting for two reasons: first, there is no boundary on the electorate that determines who gets to vote, which creates winning by trickery rather than by argument, and second, we don’t want to vote anyway.
Voting is not fun, and people don’t follow when they don’t have fun. Fun attracts people, fun is a requirement for success.
Instead we believe in the freedom to follow, profit motivation, power of initiative. Genuine leadership. Genuine trust.
If we look at it from the military perspective, the tactic rules say: "the person who takes an initiative, tends to get it”. We learn from this and we proceed. We adapt and we overcome.
We keep in our minds that liberty is a side effect of profit. Therefore we create Liberty through profit motive. Everybody is free to follow. Everybody is also free to take no action at all.
The future will be won, the liberty we create was never possible before."
Yours,

(WBTW) – 2020’s sexually transmitted infection numbers paint a mixed picture regarding South Carolina’s teens.
While chlamydia rates for the 15 to 19-year-old age group decreased by 14% from 2019, the gonorrhea rate increased by 6%, according to Beth De Santis, the chief executive officer of Fact Forward, an advocacy organization that works to lower both teen pregnancy and STI rates.
However, it’s not yet clear if those numbers were due to a true decrease in rates, or if fewer teens were getting tested during the pandemic, as medical systems were strained, hospitals closed to elective procedures and the use of dating apps skyrocketed.
“There is a definite fear that these numbers will continue to go up,” De Santis said.
Fact Forward will continue to monitor the data. Data hasn’t yet been published about if testing and treatment numbers also decreased during the pandemic.
Conway Medical Center has not seen any change in the rates of people who have been diagnosed with an STI, according to a spokesperson for the medical system.
While teen pregnancy numbers have decreased in the last decade, many teens haven’t been using condoms during sex, according to results from the South Carolina 2019 Youth Risk Behavior Survey.
About 37.4% of high school students aged 15 and older have had sexual intercourse, according to the survey results. About half of high school juniors reported that they have had sex.
More students answered that they wore a condom the last time they had sex than who said they didn’t.
Condoms were the most frequent form of contraceptive used, followed by birth control pills. More students answered that they did not use a contraceptive method than who said they’d used the withdrawal method, had an IUD or an implant, or used a shot, patch or birth control ring.
Within the last year of taking the survey, 76.5% of teens had not been tested for an STD other than HIV, such as chlamydia or gonorrhea.
While birth control is effective at preventing pregnancies, De Santis said it doesn’t prevent the spread of STIs.
She said the approach to teen reproductive sex health has shifted. While the focus on pregnancy prevention originally focused on teenage girls, it now targets all genders equally.
Fact Forward works with STI detection and treatment, and wants to increase the HPV vaccination rate. It is also working with adults who are around youth so teenagers have someone to ask questions about sexual health. That way, De Santis said, they’re not getting health information from friends or the internet.
She said that 90% of teens want their parents to talk to them about relationships and sex, but that 90% of adults think their children should learn that information from the school system, which then says children should learn about sexual health from their parents.
That loop is why Fact Forward is training parents, teachers and health professionals to become what it calls an “askable adult” that teens can come to with questions.
“You want to become an askable adult,” De Santis said. “It’s not something you can do overnight.”Sorted by

Whether one considers Norse, Greek or any of the myriads of other mythologies around the world, one is often struck by their apparent similarities. When the cultures that gave rise to them are as closely related as the Norse and Greek ones, the similarities can be partly explained by their common Indo-European roots (as is also the case with the ancient polytheistic traditions of India, Rome, the Celts etc.), but when mythologies as far-flung as those of Australia, Meso-America and Japan show many of the same characteristics, the similarities are less easily explained:
Why is Mankind so often created from clay?
Why is the theme of the great flood so common as to be nearly universal?
Why do great skygods so often battle serpent- or dragonkind?
And what is the deal with all those dragons anyway?
Many explanations have been given to these similarities, both scientific and pseudoscientific ones, but as always, the simplest, with the least number of assumptions made, is likely to be the correct one (thanks, Occam 👍). Thus, we can rule out Ancient Aliens or Divine Inspiration and the like, since these explanations make grand assumptions concerning mighty exterior forces outside the human sphere, which have never been proven to exist and are undetectable, unmeasurable, untestable and therefore unfalsifiable as well as unscientific.
Rather, one should probably assume only one thing ... that we all share a common condition; the human one. This means that we have the same sets of approximate fears, needs and experiences wherever we happen to be born. We also share but one planet, on which we follow the same natural laws, share the same resources and are subject to the same climate, atmospheric phenomena and global natural disasters etc. Our remarkable minds; unique in their ability to construe believable stories to explain it all, and in their ability to make these stories into collective truths, have then given rise to myths which are all based on common themes, as these themes are what makes us us.Wait!

Thank you!Oatmeal isn’t known for being exciting. Hearty, filling, reliable, sure. But thrilling? Nope. Often it feels like there aren't a lot of fresh oatmeal ideas out there. In fact, sometimes the morning fave is such a snooze, it’s more likely to put you back to sleep than it is to wake you up (oh yeah, ya burnt, oats!).
But oatmeal is also great for the same reason that it’s not. The fact that it’s so boring on its own means it’s the perfect blank canvas for experimenting with different flavors, textures, and cooking methods.
The next time you open that Quaker tin, consider straying from your usual combo of brown sugar and nuts, and try out some new oatmeal ideas instead. These eight surprising hacks are easy to incorporate into the routine you already have, and just a bit more exciting. (Yes, we are saying oatmeal can be exciting.)
“Rather than water, [cook your oats in] unsweetened jasmine green tea,” Jackie Newgent, R.D., culinary nutritionist and author of The All-Natural Diabetes Cookbook, tells SELF. “It’s a lovely liquid for oatmeal, and it’ll punch up your antioxidant intake.” Plus, cooking your oats in something like tea adds flavor without many extra calories.
But tea isn’t your only option. Sarah-Jane Bedwell, R.D., L.D.N., host of Cooking with Sarah-Jane, suggests using 100 percent fruit juice. It sweetens them just enough, plus adds nutrients and lots of flavor, Bedwell tells SELF. What she likes to do is pair grape juice-stewed oats with peanut butter for that perfect PB&J flavor. Or she’ll add cinnamon and pecans to apple juice-soaked oats for something akin to apple pie.
Hemp seeds, chia seeds, and (if you feel like getting a little savory) sesame seeds are all great ways to add a bit of unpredictable crunch to your oats. Bonus: These ingredients are excellent sources of protein and fiber, while also slightly lower in calories than most nuts.
OK, I know this hack seems a little gross at first glance, but it’s actually delicious. Instead of becoming icky and scrambled, when you mix uncooked egg whites into hot oats, they take on a light, whipped texture that makes your oatmeal positively fluffy. Oh, they add a ton of extra protein to your bowl, too, which is why this one’s such a great post-workout meal.
Though this may seem like a recipe for lumpy mush, the curdy texture of cottage cheese blends seamlessly with oats while also giving the whole thing a bit of creaminess. Depending on your feelings towards cottage cheese, you can use as much or as little as you like. Maybe that's a tablespoon, maybe it's a quarter cup. Again, this is a great way to sneak a little extra protein into breakfast time.
If it’s your first time dabbling on the saltier side of oats, we recommend simply topping your bowl with a fried egg, a drizzle of olive oil, and maybe even a sprinkle of Parmesan. Once you’ve nailed this basic formula, there are a bunch of other great recipes out there to try.
Kill two birds with one stone and have your coffee and oatmeal at the same time. If straight espresso is a little too bitter for you and you'd prefer something a touch sweeter, consider adding a few dark chocolate chips. They'll give the whole thing a mocha-esque flavor.
Baked oats land somewhere between a granola bar and French toast—they’re a little creamy and chewy, while still having that oat-y taste you love. Bonus: You can easily cut them up into squares and save them for later. Need a recipe to get you started? Bedwell swears by this fruity version.
Overnight oats are the ideal meal for anyone who absolutely cannot muster the strength to cook in the morning (I feel your pain). Making them is easy: Combine your oats with your wet ingredients before you hit the hay, seal them up, and stick them in the fridge. (For more detailed instructions, watch the video below.) In the morning, they’ll be ready to go. You can eat them cold as they are, or, if you prefer your oats warm, pop them in the microwave to heat them up before you dig in.

New Player Tourist Mode.
joedobo posted a topic in Suggestions & IdeasNew player tourist mode. This is a way for new players to quickly see what Wurm has to offer. They instantly jump to varius Wurm Wonders and hopefully get inspired after admiring them. They could also talk to locals in new player friendly villages and decided if a good fit for them. Limitiation: No invenotry is carried nor can they carring thing. No aggro will attack them and they can't attack anything either. Basicly they can't do any actions other then walk around and talk. They have to return to the spawn town to resume normal game play. Uncertain: I don't know if players should be able to choose thier desination or if it should be random. The frequence which they can jump is also in question. Destinations: The destinations should be Wurm Wonders picked by the community and of coarse with permission from those who created and maintain the Wonder. Another destination could be Villages that are recruiting and have proven to be helpful for new players. As far as specific game mechanics; it should be possible to make a list of exact locations which players jump to. Maybe ask the players to make some kind of greeting area at these locations. Yes, its not realistic to be teleporting around the map as some astral projection. I just feel this would a great way to show off Wurm's potential to new customers and we just need to limit them so all they can do is look and talk. Edits*** 1. If its possible limit the players range of exploration to a radius around the arrival point. This would server to limit spying. 2. An alternative might be bot controlled toon which serves as camerra. The player could view the game through the eyes of the bot as it wanders around a Wonder. Heck, the bot could even teleport between wonders. This prevents any spying issues.No matter what the problem or crisis might be you can trust us to fix any problem you have rapidly.

Can I legally drive in a three-person carpool lane on state Route 520 if I have a passenger?
A: No
The detailed answer comes from State Patrol Trooper Cliff Pratt:
The Smart Car is not addressed specifically and does not fall under the motorcycle exemption, RCW 46.04.330.
As the law is written from the legislature, the smart car would fall under WAC 468-510-010 subsection 6: “all other vehicles with the number of occupants specified on signs.”
The enforcement verbiage in RCW 47.52.025 states, “Such highway authorities may reserve any limited access facility or portions thereof, including designated lanes or ramps for the exclusive or preferential use of public transportation vehicles, privately owned buses, or private motor vehicles carrying not less than a specified number of passengers when such limitation will increase the efficient utilization of the highway facility or will aid in the conservation of energy resources.”
In plain English, that says a fully occupied two-seat car is not legal traveling in the posted three-person HOV lane.

The junior third baseman brings with him a family history in the sport of baseball. His brother Jeff played at Division-I Charlotte North Carolina before transferring to NKU, then a D-II program.
The baseball roots all start with Bohlen’s father, also Jeff, who is a former Texas Rangers’ scout.
“Baseball is a big thing in our household,” Bohlen said. “My mom loves it; my sisters love watching it. It’s nice having that supporting cast around you. My dad really instilled it at a young age. I‘m glad that he did because there’s no greater game than baseball.”
Bohlen has witnessed a transitional period for the Norse, who are in their fourth year of Division-I competition. They have participated in the Atlantic Sun Conference for each of Bohlen’s first two seasons, but 2016 will mark Northern Kentucky’s first year in the Horizon League.
“I think it’s really good for us,” Bohlen said. “I know we can compete in that conference. It’s nice for me because it’s close to home. Playing at UIC and Valparaiso and having my family come see me on weekends is going to be awesome.”
Home is Chicago Heights, Illinois, where Bohlen graduated from Marian Catholic High School in 2013. Bohlen, who holds the school’s single-season RBI record, helped the Spartans to the first state title in program history his junior year.
“As a team, we were doubted,” Bohlen said. “We were 17-17 right before the playoffs and ended up winning eight straight to capture the title. That’s something I’ll remember for the rest of my life.”
In his first year at Northern Kentucky, Bohlen batted just .167 in 28 games. However, his sophomore campaign came with significant improvement.
Bohlen boosted his average to .284 in 28 appearances, and finished the season by hitting .318 in conference play.
“He just got bigger, faster and stronger and really progressed through the program,” Northern Kentucky coach Todd Asalon said. “I threw him right into the lineup as a freshman, and he fought for playing time. The thing about Brad is that he’s a blue-collar guy. He just shoes up and works hard. He’s getting better the plate.”
It’s at the hot corner, however, where Bohlen really thrives.
“Defensively, he’s one of the best I’ve ever had,” Asalon said. “He’s got a power arm at third base. He’s hard to get out of the lineup. He doesn’t back down from anything.”
During the summer months, Bohlen will work on his two-strike approach and driving the ball to the opposite field. He’ll have three years of college baseball under his belt before the summer season begins, making him one of the veteran members of the 2016 Oilmen.
“I’m very excited about the upcoming summer,” he said. “I’ve heard great things about the Oilmen and the success they’ve had the last couple of years. I know from a couple of friends that played in the league that it’s a competitive league. I told my coaches that I wanted to play closer to home this summer, and the Oilmen were the first team I wanted to play for. I’m ready to get going.”
Extra Tidbits
Bohlen will become the first Northern Kentucky player in Oilmen history… Bohlen was high school teammates with Luis Avila, Rob Cifelli and Robby Nunn, all of whom played for the Midwest Collegiate League’s Southland Vikings… Bohlen had an RBI single against LaSalle-Peru’s Noah Lamboley as part of an eight-run third inning in Marian’s 10-2 win in the 2012 Class 3A IHSA state title game. Lamobley pitched for the MCL’s Lexington Snipes in 2015.

by javabeans
Okay, now THIS I could really get behind!
When I first heard about the adaptation of Itazura na Kiss for Korean television, I was not impressed — I’m tired of the constant Japanese-manga-to-kdrama efforts, and I was skeptical about Group Eight’s ability to handle it well. The production house’s biggest success to date has been Boys Before Flowers, and they seem to have a particular eye for translating trendy manhwas to television, but for every decent show (Tamra the Island) they’ve had a bomb (Goong S). And we all know that Boys Before Flowers was a success despite numerous flaws.
However! Now director Hwang In-roi has signed on, and that makes me very, VERY excited. Hwang In-roi did Goong and Return of Iljimae, and turned those two projects into sumptuous feasts for the eyes. I didn’t love Goong‘s pacing, but as a work of directing it’s a gorgeous feat, and Return of Iljimae, I’m sure you all know, is one of my favorite dramas ever. Those two dramas, which were both based on manhwas, have breathtaking cinematography and two of the best soundtracks and scores of any kdramas I’ve ever seen. Hwang has a sharp eye and brings out the best in his actors, including a few who were not known for their acting before working with him (Yoon Eun-hye, Joo Ji-hoon, Jung Il-woo), and has a wonderful, delicate touch with emotional beats.
Writing is Go Eun-nim of Bungee Jumping of Our Own, the 2001 film starring Lee Byung-heon and the late Lee Eun-ju.
Playful Kiss (aka Mischievous Kiss) was adapted into a hit Taiwanese drama in 2005, It Started With a Kiss, and was so popular that it produced a sequel series.
The Korean drama version will soon finish casting and begin filming in July, and is aiming for a Fall 2010 broadcast.

This is GREAT! I absolutely love ISWAK (obsessively so) and cannot wait to see a Korean version. Let the Dramabeans casting frenzy begin now, right? :-D
I'm also a huge fan of ROI, so this is just getting better and better. With Athena and now this to look forward to, fall is shaping up to be a great season drama-wise.

ISWAK takes the ditzy girl heroine to all new stages of stupidity but whether the character is cute and charming or annoying and stupid will depend a lot on the actress they cast. Here's hoping they cast someone with talent and charisma.
At least we know it's going to have gorgeous cinematography and music.

So for the K-version, I just- seriously hope that it's going to cast well! I'm soooo looking forward for this! Don't disappoint me, pretty please?!
Anyone has any suggestion of who could be the genius Naoki Irie (Zhi Shu)? Need someone who looks perfect and genius. Hmm...

Eh? The main girl of this manga/anime/drama has always been... annoying. I liked how the guy says the girl can do 10 percent of things that he can't do - which is a big deal since he's like some kindof prodigy - but the girl does things that would make feminists (even lightweight feminists - what's a real word for this?) cringe and spaz-out for days. I hope, if anything, for the kdrama that they make the girl have, even if it's just an itsy-bitsy bit, of a backbone. And you know, doesn't moon too much over the guy (but that would cause trouble since in the manga and anime she's supposed to). *sigh*

I truly excited about this drama. I loved the Taiwanese version. I hope the Korean version will even better.I cant wait to know who will be the cast , especially the main couple.
There are 10 candidates in my mind right now
1 Won Bin & Song Hye Kyo ( I want to see Hyun Bin and SHK together in the same drama again but i think it is difficult because they are real couple now. That's why I choose Won Bin ^^. They matched very well too :D )
2 Lee Chun Hee & Yoon Eun Hye ( Simply because they are my favourite actor and actress. I miss them so much in drama. They did CF together before and I thought they looked really cute together)
3. Choi Si Won &Lee Yeon Hee
4. So Ji Sub & Moon Geun Young
5.Kang Dong Won & Sandara Park
6. Jae Joong &Kim So Eun
7. Kim Jae Wook & Seo Woo
8. Jung Il Woo & Moon Chae Won / Park Ji Yeon
9. Lee Min Ki & Lee Min Jung
10. Im Joo Hwan & Jung Ryeo Won

I LOVED ISWAK so hopefully the Korean version is as good if not better. Actually I hope that the Korean version is better because the taiwanese version was good but not as good as it could be. Frankly even though taiwanese dramas are very addictive, their quality (most of the time) is pretty crappy compared to korean and japanese dramas.

omg, for the female lead:
Park Ji Yeon, Moon Geun Young, Kim So Eun, or Go Ara
for the male lead:
Jang Geun Suk ( the JGS I knew from Baby and Me plz, not the crazy eccentric fashionista!) Kim Bum, Jung Il Woo, Park Jin Woo, Park Ki Woong or Kim Heung Soo
This drama calls for a sexy, young couple !!
-Kim Bum and Kim So Eun : SoEulmates, 'nuff said!
-Moon Geun Young and Jang Geun Suk: been shipping this couple since forever!!
As for Park JiYeon, I know she'd fit this role perfectly! I don't know who I would choose to be her partner though...
As for Go Ara, I just miss her LOL; and she'd look perfect with all the smexy men listed above.
Kim Heung Soo would fit the role perfectly! He's got the looks for it and the style. ;)
Park Jin Woo and Park Ki Woong... Wishful thinking on my part. They have baby faces and probably wouldn't fit the mean role. But they're sooo cute!!!

Oh dear! As much as I was initially attracted to the premise of the story, I wanted to gouge out my eyes in frustration when I actually watched the drama! Back then I had an obsessive need to finish every series so I made myself watch every episode, though with the liberal application of the first forward button.
The pacing was glacier slow, with frequent and unnecessary side stories and characters that went no where. And I have NEVER been more irritated or frustrated with a drama heroine! She was utterly devoid of all self respect, and was the most clingy, idiotic, helpless heroine ever. While watching, my constant mantra was girl get a spine already!
Although even I have to admit that the chemistry between Ariel Lin and Joe Cheng was extraordinry, but even that could not redeem the show for me. But unlike the drama I really liked the anime, so I am looking forward to watching the Korean version :)

This was the drama that got me into dramas oohh so many years ago. The Taiwan version first and then the Japanese version. Also read the manga. When i heard about the korean version some odd moths ago, I was soo excited/petrified, I ran to my next door neighbor's apartment and had a full on hissy about it.
It will be very hard to portray the male lead without ruining the whole thing. He is what sells it. He has to be properly detached from everything(machine like) while still drawing empathy from viewers. Aside from that miraculous feat of acting, the lengthy scope of the story from high school through college is murder on pacing. Too fast and we will miss the very subtle character changes in the main male lead. Too slow and I will start hurling insults and shoes at the secondary characters.
Also the mother's casting is important since she is the comic relief and the one person in the series who is always right. I can't wait to see her camera pop out.

I think I'm spending WAY too much time thinking about this.
But right now I'm kinda hoping for Jung Il-woo; he has a really young face, so he could get away with playing a high schooler initially, and he can definitely cop an attitude when he wants to. Plus, we already know he can carry a drama!

I loved ISWAK to pieces but I don't know how to feel about this remake. First, it's Group 8 (so. I wish this drama all the popularity of Boys Over Flowers but all the quality of... not BOF... he director makes up for this though. Return of Iljimae!!) Also, I don't know how to feel about the ending. I remember reading that Group8 (or someone) said they might decide to write a "korean-style" ending, which doesn't sit right with me. I really appreciated that ISWAK left the ending open out of respect for Kaoru Tada. I always thought it was an appropriate choice on the director's part. Classy, even.
@25 aww, I miss Go Ara tooo! Altho, sometimes, I feel like her acting is a little stiff/unnatural (bu maybe it's just me). She's so pretty though [[:
I think I'd like to see Kim So Eun in this drama. I think Moon Geun Young is an excellent actress but I can't really see her acting the part of Kotoko... I guess it's because I've only ever seen her playing more serious characters that I can't imagine her in a rom-com like this will be. This role is too similar to Park Shin Hye's role in You're Beautiful for me to really want her to do this. Love her to pieces, though. As for the guys, I don't know who I'd want. I think a couple people mentioned Kim Bum? I don't know, he doesn't really do anything for me (and besides, I don't think a baby-faced actor should really play Naoki's role...)

hopefully it will not be shown on KBS though the ratings will be higher....dramas on KBS are known for its stiff kissing....not reflecting on the title at all
the male lead should be tall, look intelligent and have charisma and presence ... he will have minimal expressions throughout the show though ....thinking of LMH but it will be too soon for him to join another drama and he won't have a challenging role here...the girl's antics make up for it though I am frustrated with her clingy, klutzy character....the female lead should be lovable enough to be tolerable....loved the anime more

I hope Sandara Park gets the role. :-) She has worked with the director before, so the possibility is there. I actually also like Kim So Eun.
Now, as for the guy... Choi Si Won is good; Jang Geun Seuk, too, but he's probably steering away from the same type of character as Hwang Tae Kyung.

Is it set in high school like the original manga and ISWAK, or are they moving it to college from the get-go?
Makes a difference, some guys can't convince me they're still in high schol (cough, Bae Yong-joon in Winter Sonana, cough).
High school - since my first pick is busy with What's Up? already - I'd second Jung Il-woo (he's due for a breakout), the followed by Kim Bum. I don't think LMH is willing to do another drama or go backwards in age.
Female lead - I'm game for anyone. It's the talent not the big name that matters in making the female lead loveable and relatable, like Ariel Lin did.

Ooooh, now I'm excited. Sort of. I really, really hope the director gives to this storyline a nice refreshing touch. *crosses fingers* I need to ponder on the cast a bit. The cast-guessing game is my favorite activity. ^^''
@27 Viola
THANK YOU! That's exactly what I thought. Not to mention the fact that the heroine in ISWAK and TKA (can't speak for the manga/anime/jdorama tho) was the biggest canon Sue in the history of...well, ever. How come every.Single.Guy. Fell for her? Ahh. That was beyond my comprehension. Mind you, it's not like I hated her, but gee, she sure frustrated me. ISWAK/TKA cured me of my fear of the FF button. >_>

wow, itazura na kiss... i'm skeptical about it though... look at bof case. however, i also pray, who know, it might turn out well. as for the cast, im thinking of new and fresh faces, remember lee min ho, joo ji hoon? they weren't known before bof and goong... i think a new star is in the making ^^… for female lead, might be a little bit more familiar face, but also, someone considered 'new and fresh', and moon geun young is, imo, over-qualified, for this.. it's like using a bomb to kill a chicken. so, i'm looking fwd to a new couple that's gonna turn ppl crazy with their chemistry ^^

I did watched the Taiwan version. But I hated the guy cuz he was so emotionally unavailable for her and treated her like a distant pet. And...she was stupid beyond belief and loved him for some unknown reason. The only scene I liked was when they finally consummated their marriage and both showed some reasonable normality. I'd love to see a Korean version because by now, one should see all the spots to make improvements on. I love BOF, so I hope they will work magic and turn this into something super romantic and fun. Something to really look forward to.

@39
That is actually not a bad idea because Lee Min Ho can pull the serious/heartless guy but still keep you from hating him. He is also very good at portraying the subtle changes that are needed in this role. I just wonder if its a little too similar to his role in PT though. I haven't seen Sandara's acting enough to say whether she has the chops for it but she does have the look to play the female lead, and the CF she did with Lee Min Ho shows that they would have the chemistry. Also lookwise they can portray high schoolers and college students while still being believalble in both.
I really like Kim So Hyun but I think he looks too young for the role to be honest.
For the female I think Sandara Park, Park Shin Hye, Kim So Eun would be really good because I think they look the part. I think MGY would also be good because of what I have seen her do in "Innocent Steps" and "The Little Bride" plus she is adorable but she very rarely does roles back to back so I think its highly unlikely she would take up a role so soon and a trendy one to boot. Lee Min Jung would also be nice but I am not sure how she would do with the high school part. Also Kim So Eun is doing a daily drama still so I don't how likely she would do this role.
For the Male: I would like to see Lee Min Ho, Kim Bum, Lee Sang Woo (Life is Beautiful; Don't Hesitate), or Im Joo Hwan because they all have the abilitiy to be really serious but goofy as well while still having the audience still like the lead.
I have to admit though after BOF I was very hesitant about a remake of ISWAK but I absolutely loved Goong ( watched the entire thing is a matter of two days) mostly because of the cinematography and score so I have more hope .

oh. i just remembered ... i hope they do a very good casting for this drama. For the Taiwan adaptation "It Started With A Kiss", in the sequel "They Kiss Again" the female lead Ariel Chen won the Golden Horse Award Best Female Lead of the Year (which means very awesome acting agreed by most critics), therefore it is very important to act well as a not so smart person. there is a fine line between cute and adorable and not so smart and just pure idiotic. so i hope the female cast would be good, unlike gu hye sun who was a little let down in some ways for tsukushi. and naoki in the story who is a super handsome genius with IQ 200. I hope they find someone who fits the part. because there is so many emotional breakthroughs the actor can do if he does the part well. something like i thought lee min ho really did it better than matsu jun as tsukasa.

However, one of the challenges we are likely to face is the high wages and transfer fees it would cost us to sign some of the best talents in the game. The good news though is that we can turn to promising young players who now are valued lowly but they are highly likely to significantly improve in the course of our seasons managing in the game.
What is a FIFA 19 Hidden Gem?
A young hidden gem in FIFA 19 Career Mode is a player that has significant potential and is likely to be quite affordable. They often have low transfer fees and demand relatively low wages. Their attributes are likely to develop as they get more game time as you progress through a number of seasons. In this list, we have focused on those hidden gems aged below 21 years and with a maximum overall rating of 68 now but with a potential of having an overall rating of more than 83.
The best way to develop these young hidden gems…
Besides, you can easily develop the attributes of these hidden gems in no time. A considerable number of people have often struggled to develop their hidden gems across the various versions of FIFA so here are a few tips on how you can develop the hidden gems in FIFA 19.
A) Give the hidden gems more game time.
One way to develop your hidden gems is giving them game time in your senior squad. If you opt to try this then in a number of seasons these gems are likely to reach close to their overall potential rating which is higher than 83. The obvious concern for any manager would be whether these young players can compromise on the strength of their teams. However, if you give one or two of these hidden gems particularly those having an overall rating of 60+ a chance to either to play from the start and substitute them or give them cameo appearances in every match, chances are high they will reach their overall potential in no time without your career as a manager taking a hit. Furthermore, their match performance is likely to impact on their development. If they struggle then their development will be rather slow but if they shine then they will develop faster. If your team is struggling, you may want to try the other development options with these gems available at your disposal.
B) Loan.
Allowing the young players to go out on loans can be another alternative to get them more game time. You can allow these gems to go out on a loan and once the loan expires, you can evaluate and see whether to allow them to go out again or remain at the club. The only challenge with this though is that it might be a little difficult to get the players to leave as most reject loans in this version. There is a high likelihood that you will have to try several loans options before they eventually decide to go out on loan. Another trick for developing them could be allowing them to go out on loan but recalling them prior to the loan expires. I have tried this trick in previous versions of the game and the young players have developed when I recalled them. The only catch though is that the players have to have the ‘Has potential to be special’ description before being recalled.
C) Training.
Training can be another way to develop the hidden gems in FIFA 19. You can train the young players the same way you train the senior players. However, any career mode enthusiast should know you have to strike a balance of the training level. Train the hidden gems too much and their technical ability will improve at the expense of their physical attributes. 2 slots a week for one of these hidden gems can result in overall development within a short period of time. You should try to simulate these training drills for maximum benefit unless you are quite confident in handling them yourself.
If you are a bit jaded then we are on to the list now. Here are 15 hidden gems worth having in your team when in career mode in FIFA 19. I have tried to analyze it position by position so you can get a viable option if you are need of players for certain positions.
- Mile Svilar – GK ( 19 years).
With the likes of Gianluigi Donnarumma being rated so highly and priced beyond most FIFA 19 managers, getting a good young goalkeeper who has tremendous potential can be a Herculean task for most of your scouts. The good news though is that this hidden gem can offer you cover and a viable option if you are looking to bring in an affordable goalkeeper with a promising future in the game. Mile Svilar plays for Benfica in the game and has an overall rating of 67. He strongest attributes are his diving rated 71 and reflexes rated 70. He is likely to cost you less than $5 million and he will not take a significant raise from his current weekly wage of $1,000. Mile can be a great signing for you once he reaches his overall potential of 85 as you progress in your career.
- Christian Fruchtl – GK ( 18 years).
There has been a lot of talk about Fruchtl being a potential heir to Manuel Neuer at Bayern Munich. This only attests to his promising potential even at a very young age. Consequently, he has a fairly good overall rating of 65 in FIFA 19. Managers can prise him away from Bayern Munich for only $2.5 million and his promising future can only be an asset for fellow career mode enthusiasts. Furthermore, you will not have to pay him significant wages as he currently earns around $6,500 per week. Some of his strongest attributes are he has a rating of 68 for reflexes, a 66 for GK kicking and a 68 for GK diving. Fruchtl can be a great asset for managers once he reaches close to his overall potential of 86 in a few seasons.
- Ethan Ampadu – CB ( 18 years).
Ethan Ampadu is being talked of as being a future key player at Chelsea. The Wales international who plays for Chelsea is one of the hidden gems in FIFA 19. He has an overall rating of 63. Ampadu is valued at around $1.3 million and has a release clause of approximately $3.5. The promising center back can be a great signing if you are struggling to keep a solid back line. His greatest attribute in the game is his short passing where he has a rating of 70. He is currently on a weekly wage of around $9,200 hence his wages once signed will be affordable to a considerable number of teams. Ampadu has an average potential rating of 86 hence he can only get better with time. Moreover, you can play him as a defensive midfielder though his preferred position is being played at center back.
- Nicolas Cozza – CB ( 19 years).
For those seeking defensive signings in the game, quite a few come as good as Nicolas Cozza. The left-footed center back who currently plays for Montpellier HSC can be a quality affordable signing for most managers. He currently has an overall rating of 68. Signing him is likely to cost you around $5 million and since he takes home a weekly wage of around $4,500, he can be an affordable signing for most managers. Some of his strongest ratings are a 79 for acceleration, a 75 for balance, a 73 for sprint speed and a 74 for jumping. Cozza can be a great asset as he develops and gets to his potential overall rating of 84.
- Gian – Luca Itter – LB ( 19 years).
Itter is German left back who currently plays for Vfl Wolfsburg in FIFA 19. He currently has an overall rating of 68 which, given his young age, is good for a left back in the game. It would cost manager around $3.5 million to sign him and even a slight wage increase from his approximately $5,000 per week can be a shrewd business for any manager in the career mode of the game. His strongest attributes are 68 for crossing, 69 for shot passing, 70 for dribbling and acceleration, 68 for ball control and sprint speed and, finally, 67 for marking. Itter can be a star for your team especially when he approaches his overall potential rating of 85.
- Alec Georgen – RB ( 20 years).
The young PSG right back is one of the most promising right backs in the game. He has an overall rating of 64 but he is likely to develop and reach his potential overall rating of 81 in a very short period of time. Managers would have to part with around $2.5 million and offer a slight increase from his salary of around $5,000 per week. His best attributes ratings are 81 for balance, 75 for both sprint speed and acceleration, 76 for agility and a 70 for crossing. Pricing him away from PSG at a rather affordable price and his tremendous potential can be a joy for any manager in the game.
- Abdoulaye Dabo – CM ( 17 years).
A lot has been said about the potential of Abdoulaye Dabo, the young French midfielder who plus his trade at Nantes. One thing that a majority of the pundits agree on is that he is the future of the French national team. EA SPORTS agree with this assessment and, subsequently, they have given him an overall rating of 63 but his overall potential rating is a magnificent 87. Dabo has good ratings particularly in acceleration, short passing and ball control where he has a 69 in each of them, a 67 in long passing and a 65 in both sprint speed and standing tackle. He is likely to cost managers around $2.5 million and given he currently takes home around $2,500 per week, he can be an affordable and strategic signing for managers.
- Sandro Tonali – CDM ( 18 years).
The tenacious defensive midfielder has been touted as a future star of the Italian national team. He currently plays for Brescia in Seria B and is a hidden gem in FIFA 19. He currently has an overall rating of 67. Managers would need around $4 million to sign him and since he is on weekly wages of approximately $1,000 at Brescia, he can be affordable for most teams. Some of his strongest ratings are 72 for both short and long passing, 71 for ball control and strength, 73 for balance, 64 for standing tackles and 70 for stamina. With an overall potential rating of 88, he can develop to be a key player in your management career.
- Sergio Gomez – CM ( 18 years).
Sergio Gomez came through the youth system at Barcelona and his impressionable displays at the youth teams at the club have earned him a move to Borussia Dortmund and several caps in the national Spanish youth teams. He has an overall rating of 68 but his overall potential rating of 87 is something managers in career mode can look forward to as he develops in their teams. Some of his strongest attributes ratings are 84 for balance, 75 for short passes, 74 for dribbling and 82 for reactions. He would be worth around $4 million and given he currently earns around $13,000 per week, he can be an affordable signing with huge potential for most managers.
- Alexis Claude – Maurice – CAM/ LW ( 20 years).
The young left-footed French player currently plays for Lorient and has had relatively good early days to his career playing for their senior side. He as rose through the club’s system since 2014 and he has already made his senior debut. He has featured for them 27 times hitting the net six times in those games. Similarly, he is a hidden gem for managers in FIFA 19. He has an overall rating of 66 but he is likely to develop in a short period and reach his overall potential rating of 82 in no time. He is currently has a minimum fee release clause of around $3 million and he is on a weekly wage of approximately $2,000. Some of his greatest attribute ratings are 86 for sprint speed and 87 for acceleration. He can be a valuable asset for managers as he develops towards his potential in the game.
- Angel Gomes – CAM/ LW ( 18 years).
Angel Homes is the youngest player to be featured in a senior Manchester United game in more than half a century. He has earned several accolades both individually and as a team in various teams in both Manchester United’s youth setup and England’s youth teams. EA SPORTS agrees with pundits predicting a bright future the young English player. He currently has an overall rating of 66 but he will get to his overall potential rating of 87 in no time provided you develop him. Signing him is relatively easy given he has a release clause of approximately $3.5 million and he is on a wage of around $13,000 per week. Some of his strongest attributes are 83 for agility, 90 for balance and 75 for acceleration. He can be a good signing for most managers.
- Dominik Szoboszlai – CAM/CM ( 17 years).
The young Hungarian International plays for Liefering and is a promising young player. He has scored 12 goals from midfield playing for the outfit owned by Red Bull Salzburg over two seasons. He has an overall rating of 64 and is valued at around $2 million. He is currently on a weekly wage of $5,000 hence signing him can be relatively easy for most managers. His best attributes are a 79 for sprint speed, a 75 for acceleration and a 73 for free kick accuracy. Moreover, he has relatively strong attributes for striking the ball ( 72 shot power, 72 curve, and 71 long shots). He can add depth to your midfield while guaranteeing a promising future as you advance in career mode as a manager.
- Aitor Bunuel – RW/RM/RWB ( 20 years).
The young Spanish player is very versatile and can play in a number of positions. He currently has an overall rating of 68 but he is only bound to improve to reach close to his overall potential rating of 82 as your progress in your managerial career in FIFA 19. He is worth around $2 million and he is on weekly wages of approximately $3,000 hence signing him can be relatively easy for most managers. Some of the attributes that make him feature in this list include his rating of 85 in balance, 77 in sprint speed, 80 in acceleration and 72 in both stamina and agility. He can be a great signing for most managers if his development is handled well.
- Pietro Pellegri – ST ( 17 years).
The young Italian striker was snapped up by AS Monaco in January and given the history of the French club in identifying talents like Kylian Mbappe, it can be safe to say he has significant potential. The right-footed striker currently has an overall rating of 67 but he can easily develop to reach close to his overall potential rating of 88 as you progress in your managerial career. Signing him from AS Monaco can cost you around $5 million and you may have to offer a slight increase on his weekly wage of around $11,000 if you want to see him wearing your club’s jersey. His best attributes are 70 for finishing and 73 for sprint speed. He can rack up a number of goals needed for you to advance in your career.
- Amine Gouiri – ST ( 18 years).
The young French striker currently plays for Olympique Lyonnais and has a promising future even in FIFA 19. He currently has an overall range of 67 though with the right development he can reach close to his overall potential rating of 86. Signing the right-footed striker will likely cost around $4 million and you may have to better his weekly wage of approximately $10,000 if you want to lure him away from the French club. Some of his best attributes include 69 for finishing, acceleration and ball control, 70 for dribbling, 73 for sprint speed and 68 for shot power. He can be a great signing for most managers given his price, young age, and tremendous potential.
In as much as scouts can identify young players with significant potential in FIFA 19 Career Mode, it may take time and maybe even several bad signings before you eventually find a player who reaches close to his overall potential. However, there is a high likelihood that you can be successful in the transfer market with these 15 hidden gems if you develop them well. Given their overall rating of a maximum of 68, they can be quite affordable signings and if you develop them to surpass their minimum overall potential rating of more than 83, you will look back and be proud of having captured such stars earlier at affordable prices.Hello target audience, Many thanks to your precious time to learn to read articles in each and every snapshot we produce.

Rather that report on whatever changes I’ve seen since last week (because there haven’t been that many, to be honest), I want to send out a profound and heartfelt “thank you” to everyone who’s supported me thus far. This includes you, dear reader.
I’d also like to share a graph that seems to make the rounds on Reddit, showing the average rate of specific changes in transgender women who undergo HRT:
Of course my mileage will vary, but it’s fascinating and a little exciting to see when I can start to look for specific things to happen. It’s even more interesting to see how my changes differ from this chart. A few of the effects have already started with me, others have yet to begin.
Until next time, friends!Convergint speeds processes and improves customer service with a single system of record
With Smartsheet, security integrator Convergint increases communication and collaboration, improving transparency and quality of service for its global customer base.
Industry
- Professional Services
Organization Size
- Large (1,000 - 9,999 employees)
Region
- North America
Use Cases
- Enhance Customer Experience
- Invoice and Billing
- Professional Services Management
We reduced the New York region’s collection for accounts receivable by 23 days during the COVID-19 pandemic, when businesses shut down and many customers couldn’t pay. Smartsheet enabled us to understand where our customers stood and reach out to the ones who needed support. Our target is below 42 days; last year we averaged above 50, and this year we’re under 27 because we can track where our customers stand.
As the largest privately held security integrator, Convergint aims to be its customers’ best service provider regardless of industry. Smartsheet helps Convergint meet that goal by enabling better global communication and collaboration, improving transparency in customer engagement, and establishing a single system of record for all customer information, strategic decisions and insights.
“What sets us apart is our culture,” says Scott Gandolfe, director of program management at Convergint. “Our culture allows us to be creative and to embrace new tools and get the organization to use them as well, helping not only our customers but also our colleagues and communities. That culture stimulates our use of Smartsheet, which neatly fills in a lot of the gaps with a tool that that is flexible and adaptable. My team is able to create amazing things that, if we didn’t have Smartsheet, we’d be doing manually.”
Convergint is a $1.5 billion business with 115 locations worldwide, providing a range of services including installation and management of card readers and cameras, alarm systems, fire systems, building controls, and more. The company prides itself in creating an outstanding customer experience, but it used to be difficult to manage all the details seamlessly. Before adopting Smartsheet, Convergint relied on manual processes and printed playbooks, with no single unified process for most of its activities.
Smartsheet enables Convergint to capture all of its data, best practices, and resources in a single place. As a result, teams can make strategic decisions and act on customer priorities with confidence that they have the most current and accurate information at their fingertips.
“My goals are speed, accuracy, and simplification,” says Luke Rowan, global program manager at Convergint. “How fast can I accomplish this now utilizing Smartsheet? How much more accurate can I be now that I don’t have to have multiple data entry points? How much simpler can I make it for my colleagues and for my customers day to day? Because the simpler it is for them, the more accurate it’s going to be and the faster it’s going to be. It’s a cycle of improvement.”
A single source of accurate data to better serve customers
Each customer’s needs and requirements are unique, with frequent changes as they opt into new services or modify processes. To track those changes, teams used everything from spreadsheets to sticky notes, but the chief source of program data was the comprehensive customer playbook. The printed books were time consuming to search through and difficult to keep up to date.
“Our playbooks outline everything that touches that customer,” says Vince Fillari, global program manager. “It used to be a file that was 20 to 70 pages long. When the customer would update a procedure or the use of a product, we had to find and change all those references and redistribute the document. Smartsheet eliminated all of that. I have a Smartsheet global standards page with all of the customer’s requirements, sample pictures, documents, cut sheets, everything. If the customer changes something, I change it on Smartsheet, without having to email out a 10MB document that half the time — I’m being kind, 75% of the time — nobody looks at.”
Client meetings and reporting are also faster and simpler with Smartsheet. Instead of spending 45 minutes walking through a printed agenda and a stack of files, the Bay Area sales and operations teams can view a single program dashboard or sheet and confirm status and next steps in 10 minutes. Program managers can quickly create reports by pulling targeted data from a single source, or create customized dashboards to display the right information for each stakeholder.
“The ability to share information is like night and day,” Fillari says. “Before, if you needed to get specific information to an audience, you had to do a lot of copying and pasting from different files. You ended up thinking, ‘That’s not exactly what I wanted, but that’s the best I can do, given the data.’ With Smartsheet, it’s simple to give them a report or a dashboard very quickly. We do quarterly business reviews with our customers. In the past, I would spend a week going through files and extracting data to put together a presentation. Now, I can be ready for a quarterly business review (QBR) inside of an hour.”
A faster solution for internal business processes
Smartsheet has enabled Convergint to transform management of its accounts receivable (AR) processes by giving the team the latest information on payment status and customer activity. Using Data Shuttle, the AR team can pull data from its less flexible accounting system into a unified view with streamlined, easier-to-read account notes. Team members can see payment status, including payments that have been received but not yet posted, which allows them to prioritize outreach based on accurate figures.
That informed outreach has also enabled the AR team to cut the New York region’s time to collect on outstanding accounts by 23 days compared with the previous year. Despite shutdowns to customers’ business operations during the COVID-19 pandemic, Convergint was able to use up-to-date status information to offer customers support and tailored solutions to their challenges.
In addition to reducing AR timelines, Smartsheet cuts time for review processes so salespeople and project managers can focus on more important activities. Project approvals used to rely on paper forms circulated within a Convergint Technology Center (CTC) and take a week or more from submission to sign off. When the process was converted to Smartsheet forms with automated notifications, turnaround fell to two days — or just one, for urgent requests.
“Until recently, our Seattle CTC was still using paper to approve projects,” Rowan says. “From the salesperson to the admin to the administration manager, this piece of paper was being passed around. Working with Smartsheet, we built a paperless routing approval flow. What was beautiful about it was that we deployed it and got it nice and smooth right before COVID-19 hit.

Solutions that boost professionalism and customer engagement

Because the platform is easy to use, more and more teams throughout the organization are creating their own solutions and finding new ways to make customers’ lives easier.
“Adoption at Convergint starts with getting the concept out there to solve problems and show efficiencies,” Gandolfe says. “Second is community: we do a biweekly knowledge sharing call and other training with our customer success center, webinars, a Teams channel, and dashboards. We recently did a sprint where in two weeks we were able to get 70 people certified. Third is creativity: We don’t tell people how they have to use it, but allow them to be creative, and that’s allowed people to solve problems we didn’t even know we had. The last thing is leadership and collaboration, with both our Smartsheet customer success team and our own IT team.”
Gandolfe and his team are enjoying better cross-team and global communication, clearer insight into customers’ needs and status, and greater accountability for internal processes. Customers are seeing a difference as well, with quicker turnaround for requests and an even greater level of professionalism from their Convergint teams.
“I have four or five recurring calls every week with one customer, and they know every call that I lead, there’s going to be something I’m showing from Smartsheet,” Fillari says. “It could be reports or a dashboard, depending on the nature of the call. I knew I had finally driven it home with them when the customer said, ‘Well, Vince probably has a Smartsheet for that.’ All three of my accounts know very well that I’m a firm believer that if you can’t do it in Smartsheet, it’s probably not worth doing.”

Posted by C.L. Anthony on Thursday, March 26, 2015 with No comments

Q: How would you describe what you’ve been through since you left the Thunder?
A: “Leaving the Thunder, you see the greater side of the NBA. I went into Philly and a situation where it was the total opposite. You got a team just trying to rebuild basically from scratch and blowing up anytime you had something going good. So you definitely learn the business side of it.”
You had some crazy things that happened to you. We saw the brawl in China, but could you explain the video and what happened there?
“The play (before) I was driving and the guy fouled me. And I looked at the ref and he was, like, ‘Just keep playing.’ I was, like, ‘OK. Fine. That’s whatever.’ I go back down, come back and the guy just blatantly fouls me on a layup. I fall down on top of him and then you see me in the video trying to get up and I fell back on top of him again. And so I’m trying to stand back up and the picture that the Chinese paper got it looks like I’m about to punch him when, if you watch the video, I’m really just reaching over his leg trying to gather myself. But, of course, they tried to make the foreigner look like the bad guy in the situation, which that’s not at all what it was. And then I’m yelling at him and out of nowhere his teammate just comes and puts me in a headlock. And so that’s pretty much everything that happened.”
And what about the Philippines? Is that something that you just had to learn the hard way? Did you not know that you couldn’t say anything bad about Manny Pacquiao?
“I mean, you know going into the situation — I know who Manyy Pacquiao is. I know what he means to that country. But I didn’t think I was going to be punished as bad as I was for telling the truth, for speaking my mind on it. So I guess that’s just a situation where you’ve got to come into it and be like, ‘Man, let me just keep my mouth shut on this thing.’”
Were you surprised at how harsh or severe the punishment was?
“The fine, not so much. I mean, the fine is OK because I said something about the refs, which I didn’t lie about that either. But I said something about the refs. But just to get kicked off the team was a little crazy. And then for the president of our team to compare Manny Pacquiao to Martin Luther King was just absurd, really. And I kind of just left it all alone. I didn’t really want to say anything because I thought it would die off. But I’m starting to learn now that it’s really not. It was on SportsCenter (a few days ago). It was just incredible to me.”
What have you learned through all your travels and everything that you’ve been through?
“To work my (expletive) off and stay back in the NBA. No lie. That’s the truth. That’s the truth.”

Most masons focus on making the aesthetics of a fireplace look great on the outside at the expense of the critical design and workmanship on the inside. The most common design flaws are poor smoke chamber design, poor placement of fireplace on or in the structure, and poor flue system design. What to expect?

How the RF Series Intake Strainers work.After a long winter of indifference and discontent, a glorious summer of poetry-related programming hit the BBC recently. Poets have been everywhere (on BBC2 and BBC4) – presenting programmes, being interviewed, becoming the subject of discussions and sending scurrilous emails about each other.
That.
The poetry-in-apologetic-decline approach quickly established a cliché: the gathering of a few hasty vox pops from café dwellers, builders or shoppers, all smiling blankly or shaking their heads while failing to identify an etching of an obscure bygone poet. (But would people fare any better with a 16 or 17th century architect or painter?) This obscurity became the wrong the programme charitably set out to right. Simon Schama's shows on John Donne and Armando Iannucci's exploration of Milton's Heaven and Hell were each guilty of this – yet, crucially, both were more interesting in the moments when they confidently assumed an interest, focusing instead on expressing genuine enthusiasm for the verse.
Iannucci's passion was abundant and led him from some insightful considerations of Milton's text to some brilliantly chosen interviews: a blind academic discussed Milton's own blindness; a Guantánamo hostage revealed how poetry independently provided solace to each individual held captive in Cuba in a way other art forms could not. It all helped make Milton's language and world more tangible and led to a triumphant, tender insight into Paradise Lost's relevance today.
Michael Wood's documentary describing Beowulf's role in the building blocks of our cultural identity also had passion, although perhaps it placed the poetry too much within the nerdy awkwardness of historical re-enactment societies.
And the series My Life in Verse was celebrity-centred, but when it was heartfelt, it was good. Importantly, it conveys the consoling joy of brilliantly manipulated language – a key to good poetry TV. All those featured have been touching in their enthusiasm for poems that enhanced or shaped their lives, but patronising when shrugging gawkily about trickiness or image.
It irks to say this, but some of the less enthusing appearances have been from real poets. Simon Armitage's tracing of Sir Gawain and the Green Knight was a decent introduction, enhanced by the schadenfreude of watching Armitage getting solidly rained on, but generally it was too self-conscious and nervous. Although he was hilariously wry on occasion, ("I had arranged to meet local pagan, Chris Brown".) Armitage came across as a little too stiff and … well, wet.
And Owen Sheers's series, A Poet's Guide to Britain, wobbled between inconsequential and over-speculative to thoroughly engaging, but with too many reaction cutaways of Sheers in between. Both he and Armitage needed better direction: while the words were often good, their manners were too apologetic.
It was this beseeching quality that let the season down. It also led it astray into focusing too much on accessible biography or incident. What, for example, did we really learn about TS Eliot in Arena's BBC4 documentary, other than that he kept a scrapbook and was a bit of an old softy? And while the general preponderance of grand landscape shots provided an impression that poetry is important – almost of the land – they also demonstrated the promotion of too narrow a traditional line: the romantic/pastoral. There was little to be found of avant garde, or more experimental poetry – most likely to avoid scaring people off.
But it was, nevertheless, a valiant effort. Should viewing figures be lower than expected, perhaps it will dawn on someone that this isn't because people don't care about poetry (millions do) – but because TV producers haven't quite worked out how to televise it well enough yet. So, apology accepted. Let's see where they go from here. As the season continues, are there any suggestions to help them on the way? What might you like to see on, say, Sky's pay-per-view Poetryburnie tasmania wikipedia.

A total of 1348 migraineurs were included. Diagnosis of migraine with aura was recorded in 40% and chronic headache (≥15 days/month) was reported by 34%. Prevalence of current depression was 28% and anxiety was 56%. Childhood abuse was reported as follows: physical abuse 21%, sexual abuse 25%, emotional abuse 38%, physical neglect 22%, and emotional neglect 38%. Physical abuse and emotional abuse and neglect were significantly associated with chronic migraines. Emotional abuse was also associated with continuous daily headache, severe headache-related disability. After adjusting for sociodemographic factors and current depression and anxiety, there remained an association between emotional abuse in childhood and both chronic and migraine headaches. Childhood emotional abuse was also associated with younger median age of headache onset (16 years vs 19 years). The study suggests that physical abuse, emotional abuse, and emotional neglect may be risk factors for development of chronic headache, including transformed migraine. The association of abuse and headache frequency appears to be independent of depression and anxiety, which are related to both childhood abuse and chronic daily headache. The finding that emotional abuse was associated with an earlier age of migraine onset may have implications for the role of stress responses in migraines.”

I’ve suffered from migraines since I was 5-6 years old at least. I remember coming home from elementary school and having to go straight to bed with and icepack on my head to try to ease the pain. I couldn’t do anything else, I barely got through the school day.
I’ve wondered a lot about the link between my migraines and the emotional abuse, then I stumble across this post about this study. I’m not surprised to find that there IS a link.
My “mother” was horribly neglectful and made it quite clear through words and actions that she wasn’t interested in taking care of me. She’d tell me I didn’t matter, she’d disappear for weeks at a time, she’d beat me if she had a bad day, she refused to buy groceries or pay the house payment at times, (leaving me in fear for a place to sleep at night!) and she had a prescription drug addiction. When she was addicted to Valium, she once told me she had to take it to stay calm or else she would kill me. Nice thing for an eight year old to hear from the person who is supposed to take care of her! I started having daily, unexplained headaches as a young child and the migraines came soon after. I had severe headaches into my 30’s. They finally calmed down as I began to learn and understand and fight back about what I’d endured, (and still endure since my mom has semi-regular violent episodes and harasses me until I cut off communication.) I still get painful headaches sometimes, but they are much less common.Part 2 from the blog- Africa to America- Here are 7 things GOOD to say to adoptive parents: 1. “You are so lucky to have him.” An older lady once said this to me, and I promptly turned into a blubbering mess because I truly did feel grateful to have him.

Complementary and alternative medicine, or CAM, is a hodgepodge of medicinal to quasi-medicinal remedies. Somechiropractic and acupuncture, for examplehave crossed the line into (more or less) conventional medicine. Others lie on the fringes of medicine in the Western world.
Regardless, CAM is a hidden risk factor for life insurance. Why so? Because virtually no underwriting guidelines include consideration of these aspects of health care.
This, in turn, constitutes a very avoidable error, with implications for insurability at any age.
What Your Peers Are Reading
CAM is turning into big business. In any given year, Americans are said to spend more out-of-pocket dollars on CAM than on care from primary care physicians. The use of herbs is a growing trend, as witnessed by the profusion of retail outlets and books on the subject now widely available throughout the country. An estimated 36% of U.S. adults age 18 and up are using some form of CAM, according to a survey of 31,000 U.S. adults conducted as part of the Centers for Disease Control and Preventions 2002 National Health Interview Survey.
From a risk management perspective, every CAM intervention has some significance. But herbal therapy, broadly including all digestibles (even if derived from shark cartilage), is of particular concern for the life underwriter. Many Americans are now herb aficionados. (In Germany, herbs routinely are prescribed as medicine. Believe it or not, St. Johns Wort is the Rx of choice for mild/moderate depression.)
In North America, consumers are on their own where oversight is concerned. There is almost no CAM regulation. The Internet, not surprisingly, is the leading venue accessed by those who want to learn more. CAM Web sites abound, but unfortunately, these sites seldom help underwriters, leaving them at wits end when trying to sort out why a proposed insured might be taking a given herb.
The bad news? Underwriters seldom pay attention to herbs when herb use is mentioned on life insurance applications or cited in doctors reports. The latter, of course, is the exception to the rule anyway, as most herb users avoid telling their doctors what they take (not a wise decision, for the record, given that some herbs interfere with prescription drugs, while others are flat out toxic).
Who uses herbal medicine? Several recent epidemiological investigations indicate that men and women of all ages use herbal “remedies,” as they are often called. Many are over age 35, including seniors, and have college educations and health insurance.
Few medical professionals question their patients about the use of CAM. And, as noted above, it is commonly known that few will admit to using CAM anyway, even if asked by their physician.
What is the meaning for underwriting?...

In 2012, Lauren Becker, Erin Fitzgerald, Kirsty Logan, Michelle Reale, and Amber Sparks released Shut Up/Look Pretty, a collection of short stories and micro fictions about everything from bad break ups, vampires, to classic familial dysfunction. The contrast of narrative voices brought a charming feel to the compilation, and collectively, made for a unique reading experience.
Becker opens with a story called A Simple Explanation, which reads more like a low self-esteemed angst-ridden unhinged teenage girl than a mature woman struggling with her reality—think every single Fiona Apple song. A reoccurring personality who takes (or maybe invites) emotional abuse by the stereotypical emotionally void asshole, pining over the wrong men who ignore and abuse her, and leave her self-hating and loathing because she doesn’t fit a certain mold: “You marvel aloud at your luck in meeting me. I like you and want to warn you, but it’s really your own fault. Don’t envision a history with me. Just take me home tonight and don’t call tomorrow. I will cry and think ‘always’ and ‘never’ and it will feel right to me.” Independent Living was a glimpse into the black hole of an old folks’ home. The well-written piece exposed Becker’s true talents as a writer as she conveyed complex emotions of the dismal environment in mere sentences. Becker’s prose is often fragmented, but she’s mastered the art of expressing the darkest emotions of the human experience, which most choose to bury, drink away, and forget.
__Erin Fitzgerald imaginative stories of hospital stays and unemployment take place in small-town college dorm rooms and doctors’ offices.
Where Did It All Go Wrong is a heartbreaking tale of giving up the daily comforts, quite possibly necessities, in the heart of the economic recession. Fitzgerald hits hard with blatant one-liners, but also conveys a slew of somber emotions, as exhibited in the opening of Fed Up In Phoenix, “You started getting the newspaper right after you got married, because Laurie thought it would be cute for the two of you to read the paper over breakfast. Then both of your shifts changed and you ate together less and it stopped for a while.” A story with such a powerful twist that it sucker punched me in the gut and I walked around for the rest of the day with an inexplicable ping in my side. This Morning Will Be Different is a humorous and engaging story about coming home from a surgery to an empty house after a fresh break up. “I will start taking ibuprofen three times a week, even if nothing hurts that ibuprofen would fix...If I can’t find someone to talk to that early in the morning, I will invent an eccentric friend in an artist’s colony in Taos, where it will be 4am. She will not have been able to sleep, she is so filled with inspiration.” As the collection presses on, Fitzgerald’s prose and content increase in eccentricity, from stories of fraud to inmate snail mail in a “To Lindsay Lohan from Erin,” a one-way dialogue with no other than Lindsay Lohan. Nonetheless, a great collection of short stories.

Kirsty Logan’s novella Local God is about a Scottish rock band and its stereotypical womanizing sociopath of a lead singer, Francis Faskally. Logan’s dynamite writing never wanes, particularly when she’s introducing a character: “Before I met Tibor, I thought I knew what Christians looked like—this was vital information so that I could avoid them. Then I met Tibor, with his shaved head, nose ring, and muscled arms, like a threatening extra from a prison movie. Several local god girls at uni are feverishly, obsessively, frantically in love with Tibor. They are all beautiful and insane. Tibor is not bad-looking and he’s in a band—which is plenty for some girls—but he also has a secret weapon. Tibor is saving himself for marriage.” Logan has the matchless ability to set the scene and draw out her characters so precisely that I feel as if I’m there in the room listening to the dialogue unfold and tensions rise. Though the short story starts off slow and cliché, it morphs into an entertaining, engaging, and fantastical mind fuck. My only gripe is that I can’t read it again with a virgin pair of eyes.

With a dream-like writing style, Michelle Reale uncovers the barbaric and ugly side of suburbia, culture clashes, dysfunctional relationships, and even blind dates in flash-length stories. In Folk, the connection between two people fizzles just as quickly as the 200-word piece reads: “We: ‘Welcome.’ On the other side: ‘Go Away.’ I lit my cigarette and didn’t care. ‘Imagine that,’ I laughed. He rolled down the window and looked the other way.” In What Passes For Normal, a young girl watches and listens to her callous mother verbally abuse a child with a mental disability: “‘God gives them strength since they have nothing upstairs to work with!’ She taps her head with a French-tipped fingernail. My mother blows a stream at Belinda. She laughs when the girl sputters. Belinda’s mouth looks like the downward grimace of the tragedy mask of theater. The smoke from my mother’s cigarette drifts forming a corona around Belinda’s head that looks too small for her body.” I had to re-read a few of Reale’s more poignant stories, but the second round was a literary adventure in itself and I was able to gain a better understanding of her vision.
__
Amber Sparks’ poetic and ethereal stories of life, death, and the gristly transitions in between remind us mortals of our inevitable (and grim) battle with mortality. Sparks fuels her stories with darkly comical details, which become increasingly graphic throughout her collection. She opens with A Great Dark Sleep, one man’s portrayal of living among ghosts and their playground. Haunted by some isolated trauma, the man is unable to let anyone new into his life, and devotes his time and energy to keeping the “ghosts” content. He even bans his daughter from using any technologies such as the internet, TV, and phone under the belief that “the signals would interfere with those the ghosts give off, with the live trails they leave looping through the air.” The Stages of Human Decay is none other than a play-by-play narrative of the human body decomposing: “After only five days it seem impossible she wouldn’t recognize you, but you are not you. You have transmogrified; you are a monster, a shiny, blistered human skin sack stuffed with liquefying tissue, leaking juice and gases from every orifice. You would be embarrassed to be seen in this condition. You were always so tidy and clean.” From cola guzzling vampire hunters to a murdered husband who somehow returns to life and sprouts wings, Sparks’ well-written content draws on the imaginative occult.

At times, navigating through a 300-page collection of intense and heavy material from five of the scene’s powerful and artistic writers was overwhelming; however, the generous sampling allows each contributor to highlight herself as an individual and as an essential voice in Shut Up/Look Pretty’s multifaceted illustration of the human condition.

The study involved 12 participants who had all suffered an extremely traumatic experience decades ago and who still suffered from PTSD symptoms. Problems experienced included nightmares, anxiety, depression, being hyper vigilant, and difficulty getting to sleep or staying asleep through the night. Senior study author, UCLA neuromodulation division director, and UCLA psychiatry professor Dr. Andrew Leuchter said “We’re talking about patients for whom illness had almost become a way of life. Yet they were coming in and saying, ‘For the first time in years I slept through the night,’ or ‘My nightmares are gone.’ The effect was extraordinarily powerful.” Leuchter continued with “Most patients with PTSD do get some benefit from existing treatments, but the great majority still have symptoms and suffer for years from those symptoms. This could be a breakthrough for patients who have not been helped adequately by existing treatments.”
The nerve stimulation treatment for chronic PTSD symptoms uses a small patch that is applied to the forehead. While the user sleeps the patch stimulates the trigeminal nerve. The research study has been published in the medical journal Neuromodulation: Technology at the Neural Interface. The next step is to recruit military volunteers to examine the effectiveness of TNS treatments further. The first study involved civilians but military veterans also end to experience PTSD in very high numbers due to combat situations.Westminster Fire Station: Existing Building Roof
The roof of Grade ll listed Westminster Fire Station was re-tiled using reclaimed roof tiles, from the existing roof. They were supplemented with a small area of new tiles from the same quarry from which the original tiles were sourced in 1906. Slate is an incredibly sustainable material and can last more than 300 years. So we still have at least 200 years of life in the original slate tiles.
The view from the roof is spectacular.

Please check out my post entitled Product Review: Investing with Robinhood before reading.
I joined Robinhood in 2019. Since taking the leap of faith with them in the investing world, my portfolio has been skyrocketing, and I haven’t looked back.
You see, I always wanted to invest in stocks and bonds as a young adult, but I lacked the knowledge, and no one in my circle actively invested. Investing and personal finance also are not taught in public American schools, and books have their limits.
It was Robinhood who initially educated me and opened the doors to the obscure world of investing.
Why I Remain Loyal to Robinhood?
At this time, I have no desire to leave Robinhood. I am not saying I would never leave. I am not that naive, but to date, Robinhood hasn’t given me a reason to lose confidence in them.
Investing in stocks, bonds, and crypto in the same place without fees has been amazing! I have joined a few more brokerage firms since 2019, but none of them offer the same features as Robinhood like crypto. By using Robinhood, I have gained five-figures to date, which is wonderful! You can’t earn a return like that by parking your money in a high-yield savings account these days. What Robinhood has done to the industry and for the retail investor is truly revolutionary!
I know in the crypto world, there is a saying: not your keys, not your crypto. Technically, you don’t have access to your private keys on Robinhood. However, a few nights ago, Robinhood posted the following announcement on Twitter:
Don’t sleep! Much wow! Robinhood Crypto offers seven tradeable coins, so you can buy and sell crypto like DOGE, BTC, ETH, and LTC, 24/7/365. We’re also building deposits and withdrawals for ALL listed crypocurrencies. – Robinhood
Robinhood tweet on February 16, 2021.
So, it looks like we may get our private keys after all! This is just another example of how Robinhood is steadily trying to improve its platform. If they provide private keys in the future, it is recommended to get a hardware wallet like the Ledger Nano X. Now, we just need them to add more crypto coins.
Final Thoughts
I am sure some of you will continue to give Robinhood the side-eye. I understand. We hold them to a higher standard than other brokerages. After all, their name is Robinhood, a nod to Robin Hood – the legendary hero who took from the rich and gave to the poor.
Last month, when they restricted buying and trading activity with stocks like GME and AMC, I too was disappointed. I believe in a free market, and the average retail investors shouldn’t be restricted.
Since the restrictions have been lifted, co-founder and CEO Vlad Tenev has apologized and explained Robinhood’s actions to the mainstream media, social media platforms, and Congress. According to their blog, restrictions were placed on these volatile stocks “in an effort to meet increased regulatory deposit requirements.” They acknowledged it was unacceptable and pledged to avoid it from happening again in the future.
I truly believe transparency and innovation will continue to be their key to success. I believe in their brand and will continue to be loyal to Robinhood because they changed my life for the better.
Do you use Robinhood? If not, please share your opinions in the comments. Feel free to use my link, so we can both get a free stock.

The artist’s true colors are not found in paints and brushes, but in one’s palette of talent. The first order of business, then, is recognizing our talent, because it
An Exhibition of Young Artists' Work at the National Gallery of Zimbabwe is how we achieve something significant. One cannot think of any original masterpiece that did not involve a well-developed talent.
The National Gallery of Zimbabwe is hosting an open call exhibition ,an exhibition which allows artists to showcase their talents, creativity and innovativeness to the best of their ability under the theme “Matarenda” from the 18th of July to the 5thof October 2016.
Matarenda is a traditional young artist exhibition, exploring the work and talent of the born frees following in the footsteps of last year’s born free exhibition. This will focus on work by artists under the age of 35.
With Matarenda exhibition the journey to creative excellence has begun with finding the key to unlocking that special artistry. This approach breaks with the traditional wisdom that would have artist decide on some dramatic destination. But a destination has little relevance if they do not have the means to reach it in the first place. Using natural gifts is the means to any significant end giving out the best of their ability.
This exhibition seeks to explore the importance of this talented generation of Zimbabweans in expressing themselves in any form. The exhibition will provide a form of search solutions through the artists’ work from their own informed context and more complete picture of the reality of their talent can be seen.
These young artists will exercise their own voices on the realities of the present day. Hearing echoes from the older generation of artists has been exciting, but one must not forget that talentsfinds inspiration in the day to day struggles they encounter. This exhibition offers a platform for the young artists to posit the question: "What roles can the young artist play in bettering their own lives and that of the nation at large using their talents?" The world has become fluid in terms of information flow and how people ought to conduct themselves in their respective societies because of lack of resources. The solutions are to be found in the Matarenda exhibition in which artists realize that the present is an interwoven mixture that requires several artists with dynamic ideas to continuously improve on past and present accomplishments by giving what they see as the best.
Matarenda is part of the mirror of our society, artists and their artistic expression, are as important as their parents, grandparents, brothers and sisters. This mirror is here to reflect on different talents in which the young artists through this ground breaking exhibition that will see different mediums explored to the best of their capability.This is becauseso many people are afraid of exploring their talents instead they hold on to them sort of protesting them from being seen. Talent need to grow and be enjoyed. A talent is best kept secret ingredient to success.
Lilian Magodi’s Kubvumbamira Tarenda, Ngonidzashe Tsiga’s Unleashing the spiritall point to the fluid nurturing of talent and Kudakwashe Dongo’s Ghetto resembles the anger, sorrow, suffering and bondage of the youth growing in the ghetto and their talent. Much of the ghetto talent has become more like our Zimbabwean diamond, precious yet without a market due to various reasons such as poverty and lack of upliftment. We hold on to it robustly whilst we are tied up, hoping for a change.
Talent Kapadza brings out the point that self-determination means finding and using your inner resources of peace, love and strength in order to become free from all past influence that leads to lack of clarity, wrong decisions, or mistakes, waste of time or energy, loss of senses of choice and negative emotions.

Trying to find the answer to an unusal question for a short story. Would you be able to set fire to an indigo plant without an accelerant. ie does it burn?

Depends on whether it is green or dry, and how hot the fire is. If it's dry, almost anything will burn it. If it is green, a hot prairie fire would probably consume it, but you couldn't get it to stay on fire on your own--not with matches, not even with gasoline.
I say this based on recent experience trying to burn botanical refuse while we clear our property.

Ditto Joe Smith. It's an herbaceous plant, and its properties of flammability will work much like any other, I suspect. Because of that, I doubt you'll be able to find any specific further information.

But otherwise, yeah. There's nothing in indigo that makes it more or less burnable than your average plant.

The decision comes after employees Nate Saul and Molly Diers resigned in January 2018, saying the work environment at the theater was uncomfortable, particularly for women.READ MORE: Hornets Blister Timberwolves From Long Range, 133-115
The judgment handed down Monday said Diers had unfairly received a poor performance evaluation and that administration had broadly threatened employees for engaging in union-protected activities, like repeatedly reporting harassment in the workplace.
In addition to the cease and desist of unfair labor practices, the judgment orders the Guthrie to post notices of the decision throughout the building. Further, it orders the Guthrie to remove Diers’ poor performance rating from its files.READ MORE: 'We Just Wanted To Go Hard': Shoppers Endure Early Mornings, Long Lines For Black Friday Deals
In a statement sent to all Guthrie staff, a managing director James Haskins said:
“While we respectfully disagree with the decision of the judge, which found in favor of the former employee, we will not appeal the decision. We will post the NLRB’s remedy and recommended affirmative actions, which in summary include: amend the former employee’s performance evaluation; list current employees’ rights as defined by federal law; list actions the Guthrie will not take that could negatively impact current employees’ protected, concerted activity; and share the posting with current and past collective bargaining unit employees who worked for the Guthrie at any time since September 1, 2017.”

We propose a novel approach to automatically produce multiple colorized versions of a grayscale image. Our method results from the observation that the task of automated colorization is relatively easy given a low-resolution version of the color image. We first train a conditional PixelCNN to generate a low resolution color for a given grayscale image. Then, given the generated low-resolution color image and the original grayscale image as inputs, we train a second CNN to generate a high-resolution colorization of an image. We demonstrate that our approach produces more diverse and plausible colorizations than existing methods, as judged by human raters in a "Visual Turing Test".Editorial Note

We see it as a solid plastic and as liquid paint, but have you ever considered how much acrylic there may be in your clothing?
Acrylic is everywhere and in more items of clothing than you might suspect. If you go to your wardrobe and go through some of your sweatshirts and winter wear, you might find that there is at least a small percentage of acrylic in there. So, what is acrylic? How is it made and how can we take advantage of it in our sewing and crafting projects?
What is Acrylic Fabric?
Acrylic fabrics are synthetic materials created from a man-made yarn. Often, this yarn is knitted into a material to mimic wool for outerwear. You can also find other sheets of acrylic for items of clothing or practical use. Acrylic is also an important part of a range of other materials from paint to carpeting.
How is Acrylic Fabric Made?
As acrylic fabric is a synthetic material, it needs to be created from plastics in a processing plant. There is a long process involved in turning the basic materials into sheets or fibers for yarn. The polymers involved are extruded carefully, spun into fibers, and then processed and treated to become the final material. Any material created has to have a composition of at least 85% acrylonitrile for the material to be classed as acrylic.
Acrylic Fabrics Used In “Woolen” Winter Wear
A common application for acrylic material is winter wear because of the different benefits mentioned below. You can find a range of sweaters, sweater dresses, and other more thermal products like hoodies with acrylic in them. They may not be 100% acrylic but, many manufacturers will add a good percentage of acrylic to polyester to create a more advantageous blend. You can find items in all kinds of colors and styles. This goes for scarves, hats, and gloves too.
Knitting With Acrylic Yarn
This creation of acrylic yarn as a spun material means that you can get balls of the stuff for use in your own projects. Yarn doesn’t just mean wool or similar fibers from goats, alpacas, and other farmed animals. If you can spin a material into long twisted strands ready for weaving and knitting, you have yarn. The spun materials created in acrylic processing plants are easily packaged in the same way for use in both commercial and personal ventures.
Acrylic yarn is, therefore, a great synthetic alternative to those animal-based products. While some will question the environmental implications of using a material like this in clothing, and the processes involved, others like the idea of reducing their reliance on animal products in their clothing. Keen knitters can switch out their wool for a ball of acrylic yarn and get some similar results in terms of feel and warmth. This is a great idea when making gifts for other people.
Is Acrylic Yarn Better Than Other Materials?
Knitting with acrylic yarn isn’t necessarily any better than using wool if you have no concerns about the origin of the material. Some people find that it is a nice affordable alternative with great durability and color options. Others prefer the natural softness of wool. More generally, there are other benefits and disadvantages to using acrylic fabric, as you will see below.
An alternative option here is to look for yarn that is a blend, rather than exclusively acrylic, wool, or anything else. This is a great way of finding something affordable and durable but with a little extra softness or stretch. You can also look out for acrylic in the best hand knitting yarn. This is a great way to use this synthetic material to create oversized blankets for winter.
The Benefits of Acrylic Fabric
There are advantages in choosing acrylic, either in store-bought clothing or when making your own items at home. Acrylic is one of the more durable materials and can ensure that anything you knit lasts a little longer. Acrylic is also warmer than wool as it is dense and less breathable. This means that you can feel the benefits more easily when out in the cold. Those living in areas with harsh winters could see a big difference.
There is also the fact that acrylic doesn’t shrink in the same way as wool. Therefore, there are fewer concerns about machine washing acrylic items. However, it should also be noted that acrylic sweaters can stretch out quite easily with time or rough handling. So, you still need to be careful with these garments. The plastics in acrylic also don’t respond well to high heat as there is a melting point. This means it is best not to dry these materials in the dryer.
The Disadvantages of Acrylic Fabric
One of the additional disadvantages of acrylic is the lack of breathability. While this can be helpful for trapping heat in insulating clothing, it can make these items more uncomfortable than anything made from wool. Wool can be lighter and more easily layered as needed.
Another downside is the environmental implication of creating a synthetic material in a factory. This can require a lot of energy and water, especially when the materials are dyed and spun into the final pieces of yarn. There is also the fact that plastics don’t biodegrade in the same way as wool and cotton.
The Popularity of Acrylic as a Plastic and Material
Acrylic isn’t just a popular material for yarn and knitting sweaters. You can find acrylic in a wide range of products where the strong synthetic fibers can mimic the natural softness and hold the right color. A good example of this is carpeting. We saw before how acrylic yarn and materials are ideal for cozy throws and winter wear. But, they also make great piles for carpets and rugs. If you want to sit on the floor and mindlessly run your fingers through a thick faux fur rug as you drink your cocoa this winter, chances are that it will be an acrylic rug. You can also find these softer fibers in wigs and hair extensions.
Then there are all the times when we use acrylic as a hard plastic rather than a lighter fabric. This shows how the structure and treatment of these polymer strands can play a big part in the properties of the material. There are applications from industrial sectors and aeronautics to personal electronics and more. The plastic of your false nails could also be acrylic, which may explain the familiar feel of the material and the bold range of colors.
Acrylic As a Paint
Many of us will be more familiar with acrylic as a paint. The plastics within the paint give it completely different properties to other common paints. Artists that prefer to work in acrylic love the fast drying process and the way that the paint hardens with dense blocks of color. It is great for quicker projects where you aren’t waiting ages for a section to dry – as with oils – where there is a risk of moving or muddying the paint. It is also far more vibrant than watercolors. If you leave some paint to dry on a palette and then peel it off, you can notice the tacky feel and elasticity that comes from the polymers. Nowadays you can even get acrylic paint in paint pens. Which, makes it easy to work with, less of a mess, and suitable paint for all ages.
Can You Use Acrylic Paint On Fabric?
Of course, if you are an artist, you are probably also familiar with the problem of getting acrylic paint on your clothes. The fast-drying paint means that the polymers and pigments bond with the fabric pretty quickly and is a pain to get off. Removing acrylic paint isn’t impossible, and you can learn more in our guide: does acrylic paint wash off?
But, what if you want to deliberately use acrylic paint to decorate a piece of clothing or an accessory? Fabric paint does exist as a way of adding design to garments, bags, shoes, and more. But, the properties and color of acrylic paint make it seem like the perfect addition to clothing. The downside to this is that it will harden on the surface rather than seeping into the fibers. But, you can still get some interesting effects. The designs might not last too long. It all depends on how you care for the pieces.
Acrylic Is More Common And Practical Than You Might Assume
So, as you can see, acrylic is all around us. We can not only find it in a range of synthetic blends for winter wear, but use acrylic yarn and acrylic paint for a more hands-on experience with the material. Acrylic isn’t perfect, and may not be the ideal alternative to wool in all situations, but it can be comfortable, durable, and affordable. Get to know which items you own are acrylic, care for them properly, and consider using acrylic paint and yarn yourself in some interesting.Barsukov, Evgenii
Barsukov, Evgenii Zakharovich
Born Mar. 16 (28), 1866; died Jan. 21, 1957, in Moscow. Soviet military figure, major general (1940), doctor of military science (1940), member of the Academy of Artillery Science (1946).
Barsukov graduated from the Aleksandr Military School in 1885 and from the second class of the General Staff Academy in 1895. From 1899 on he served in the Main Artillery Directorate. From 1910 to 1915 he was assistant to the general inspector of artillery and his charge d’affaires, and a member of the Artillery Committee and of a commission on army reform. At the same time he taught at the Officers’ Artillery School. From January 1916 on he was chief of the administration of the field inspector general of artillery at General Headquarters and chairman of a commission on organizing special purpose heavy artillery, with the rank of major general. After the October Revolution he went over to the side of Soviet power and became chief of the Artillery Administration of the supreme commander in chief in December 1917. In April 1918 he was inspector of the artillery of the western screen sector, then within the Administration of Special Purpose Heavy Artillery. From 1924 on he was in the Administration for Studying and Utilizing the Experience of the War. Later he worked as an instructor and scholar; he retired in 1934. He is the author of works on the history of artillery (Russia’s Preparation for the World War From the Point of View of Artillery, 1926; Russian Artillery in the World War, vols. 1–2, 1938–40; and The Artillery of the Russian Army, vols. 1–4, 1948–49). In addition he revised and expanded A. A. Manikovskii’s Combat Supply of the Russian Army in the World War (2nd ed., 1930).A good friend of mine is a French translator who also does voice overs for French language TV commercials, training videos, etc. At lunch this weekend, he told me a story about a client that made me think about how overly US-centric most companies still are. Most companies these days do business in every market worldwide, so why is this still an issue? The story:
My friend was recording a voice over for this company – let’s call it “4tel” – and he ran into the issue of how to pronounce the name of the company when it is spoken aloud. He chose to pronounce the way his audience would upon seeing the logo: “quatre – tel”. This company chose to name itself with a numeral and surely they must have thought that the numeral would be pronounced appropriately in each language (vier-tel, cuatro-tel, quattro-tel, etc). Wouldn’t you think?
Well, of course not. “4tel” made him re-record the entire spot and say “Four-Tel”. Do they expect that non-english speakers will just instantly make the connection between a written “4tel” and a spoken “Four”? What if they person hearing it doesn’t know english numbers? That’s still a possibility in many markets.
It shows either a lot of arrogance on the part of a US based company or just complete ignorance when they named their company. Either way, this isn’t a good way to globalize your brand or your products.
So what is the right thing to do? Personally, I’d prefer to either take the ambiguity out (avoid numerals), or let the locals say it how they want. MSFT has the new XBOX 360 and YHOO has its own 360. I wonder how those will be spoken aloud “trois cent soixante” anyone?Windrush Hill Construction is a full service contracting firm specializing in home renovations, additions, and custom home design-build project management for clients throughout Niagara.

“Completing the 100 is a major logistics problem. You’re always juggling so many balls in the air—the schedules of different hosts and your own, tournaments, outings, renovations, weather ... for someone to do that in 12 months is absolutely amazing.”The start of a new year is a great time for taking stock. And, with digital transformation continuing to sweep through companies large and small, technology is a great place to start. Big-time CIOs and IT-savvy leaders of small- to mid-size businesses (SMBs) alike know the latest technologies – such as cloud services, mobile devices and security solutions – will be critical for operational efficiency and competitive advantage in 2017 and beyond.
They also know they shouldn’t face these challenges without expert help. As we’ve mentioned many times in this space, there’s no reason SMB leaders shouldn’t hold their IT Managed Services Providers (MSPs) to the same high standards corporate leaders require of their IT support teams.
So, what traits should your MSP share with the “standout IT service pros” of the corporate world? Technical expertise should be a given, with a versatile, adaptable skill set that mirrors today’s rapid-fire business environment. A working knowledge of your business should, of course, come from you. (Not sure how to provide this insight? See our post “Answer 5 Critical Questions for your MSP.”)
But how about those vaunted “soft skills” given so much press in today’s business magazines? We reviewed posts by Creating IT Futures and ITBusinessEdge and gleaned these five traits that separate “standout IT service pros” from the crowd:
Perhaps the best indicator of standout performance from your MSP’s support team is poise. When your IT service pro calmly and assuredly use phrases such as “Let me look into that. I’ll come back with recommendations.” You’ll know you’re in good hands.This week I will share with you a couple of the dishes I will be serving on Thanksgiving. Yes, if you are curious what will be for dinner this year, bear with me for just a little bit…Of course we will do all nine yards, how they’re saying…big roasted turkey and everything. It took me quite a while to decide what side dishes and dessert to make for this Thanksgiving dinner. There were so many amazing recipes this year, so many choices, have tried a couple of them but I knew I had a winner when I saw the mushroom, potato and pancetta gratin in Birthday Issue of Good Food Magazine.
Well, you must be asking what could be so special about this gratin…Everything….the flavor, first of all. The cream mixture with the herbs is cooked for 20-30 minutes, over low heat and then allowed to sit and infuse for some more time. The crisp pancetta, the mushrooms and rich, decadent potatoes… There is a rich dish, don’t ask me how many calories per serving 🙂 but so delicious and perfect as an addition to your Thanksgiving dinner. Who is going to count the calories on Thanksgiving?!
It is definitely not a 60 minutes dish 🙂 there is some extra time required in the oven to get this Mushroom, Potato and Pancetta gratin rich, creamy and bursting with flavors.
I’ll be back tomorrow with our dessert choice for this year! Hope you’ll enjoy it!
- 6 garlic cloves
- 1 onion halved
- 3 bay leaves
- 3 thyme sprigs
- 475 ml heavy cream
- 300 ml whole milk
- 10 slices pancetta diced
- 250 g mushrooms roughly chopped after cleaning
- 1 kg/ 2.20lbs medium potatoes
- 1 tbsp butter
- salt and pepper
- Put the garlic cloves, onion, bay leaves, thyme, heavy cream and milk in a pan. Bring to the boil over low heat, partially cover with a lid and cook for 20-30 minutes until the onion is tender. Turn off and leave everything to infuse for 15 minutes.
- Strain the cream mixture into a bowl and discard the herbs. Put the garlic cloves and onion in a blender and whizz until smooth, adding some cream. Stir the paste back into the rest of the cream and season with salt.
- Put the diced pancetta in a cold frying pan and cook gently, over a low-medium heat so the fat melts into the pan, until the pancetta is really crispy. Remove the pancetta with a slotted spoon, add the mushrooms and turn up the heat, frying the mushrooms until golden and dry.
- Preheat the oven to 355F/ 180C.
- Leave the skins on the potatoes and slice as thinly as possible. Grease with butter a baking dish. Layer up the potato slices, scattering over the crispy pancetta, the mushrooms. Finish by slowly pouring over the cream mixture so that it settles among all the layers, then scatter over some thyme leaves. Cover with foil and bake the gratin for 1 hour, then remove the foil and bake for 30 minutes more until golden and crisp on top.
- Enjoy!

Protecting Multi-Tenant RabbitMQ Instances From Queue Backlogs
Let's take a look at how to protect multi-tenant RabbitMQ instances from queue backlogs and also explore the topology..
We use tools like event brokers (like Apache Kafka) and message brokers (like RabbitMQ) in our microservice architectures to share data between multiple microservices. If we are following patterns like event sourcing, command sourcing, and asynchronous communication, these messaging tools become more critical components of our architectures.
Some of these tools should be treated as shared infrastructure components that are utilized by multiple microservices. The reasons vary, but the first one is the complexity of the tool/technology that will be deployed.
Some tools are heavy-weight by nature and may not be feasible to be installed within an individual microservice's topology and this applies not only to brokers. Data sources like NoSQL (like Cassandra), or RDBMSs (like Oracle) can fall into this category. These tools may require dedicated optimization, special hardware, special licensing schemes, or may not get along with microservice’s execution environment (like containers). The complexity of the technology itself can also require specific engineering skills that may not exist in all scrum teams.
Shared infrastructure components may also bring cost savings in most cases. (You don't typically auto-scale these components - spinning-up new ones or killing the unnecessary ones due to load conditions)
Hey, we won’t give up our microservice principles. We still need to segregate the "data" of the microservice and we do this by applying logical partitioning to these tools. We will create dedicated Cassandra datasets, RDBMS databases, Kafka topics, RabbitMQ queues for these micro-services and eliminate coupling.
However, we still share the hardware/software infrastructure. The environment is shared, multi-tenant and it should provide fair-usage to its tenants. If one microservice is abusing its message queue/topic, due to a legit traffic spike or a buggy code, this may affect other microservices performance living on the same cluster.
Some tools will give you options to limit tenant behavior via different mechanisms. On Kafka, for instance, we can apply quotas to users/client IDs to enforce a maximum publisher/consumer throughput. On others which don't provide this functionality, we can implement some workarounds.
In this article, I will touch on a strategy that we can apply to protect our RabbitMQ broker.
RabbitMQ provides 2 mechanisms to apply segregation. Virtual hosts and queues. A virtual host can be created per microservice which will hold all the logical infrastructure definitions like Queues, Exchanges, users etc. This is a good practice as this allows the teams to manage their own AMQP topologies. However, this does not stop a virtual host to demand more from the underlying physical RabbitMQ instance.
Under load, RabbitMQ will start to choke first on memory. The default behavior is to keep the queue messages in the memory (even for persistent messages). This is for performance purposes and allows Rabbit to respond to consumers more quickly. The more un-ACKed messages in the queues, the more memory Rabbit will consume.
Rabbit introduced the queue parameter "lazy" to cancel this behavior and skip the memory. In lazy mode, the messages are directly written to disk. This is especially useful for queues that will hold messages for longer times, like staging queues. However, this will obviously affect the consumption rate.
When the total memory reaches to a preconfigured percentage of the total machine memory, Rabbit will start paging to disk to free up memory and in the meantime, it will start applying backpressure to protect itself from the demanding publishers. Unfortunately, it does this by rejecting the publishers and it is not a "slow down" mechanism. This means that the publisher should implement retries as soon as it starts getting rejects from the broker. If the publisher code is a legacy that you don’t want to touch, a 3rd party component, or simply you want leaner publishers, that may not be your preferred scenario.
During this stop-the-world kind of situation, all the publishers (regardless of their maturity) will go to a halted state and we don't want this to happen. This steers us to focus at the contention point: Queue.
The best practice in dealing with Rabbit queues is to keep the queue empty at all times. Queue backlogs can happen only in one situation: when publishers publish faster than the consumption rate.
We can mitigate this by auto-scaling our consumer fleet by watching the queue metrics (Unacknowledged message count). However, if auto-scaling is not available and we are dealing with an unexpected peak load, we can start seeing the backlogs. Rare situations like catastrophic failures can also occur on the consumer side which causes message pileups.
We need to put some governance around our queues that are owned by different applications/ different teams. The technical enforcement of this can be done via a basic queue configuration parameter: Maximum Queue Length.
The governance process is simple: before creating the queues, it will be mandatory to set this parameter which ensures there will be at most Maximum Queue Length messages on the queue at a given time. (The application should estimate the maximum number of publishes in a peak time that can be backlogged in the queue and a baselining study is beneficial)
The queue will then be created with this parameter. But what happens if you publish more?
This is called “overflow” in Rabbit terms and the default overflow behavior is to drop the messages from the head of the queue to make room for new messages. For some use-cases, we can live with this but for some others, we may be required to keep all messages.
To tackle these situations, we need to be creative with some AMQP components.
The topology is depicted below:
The idea is to dead-letter the messages that are overflowing to another queue with a default TTL associated. Since this queue should not consume memory, its type is set to "lazy". The messages will be staged here for a TTL amount of time and be dead-lettered to a different queue, test_shovel. (Rabbit will not allow us to send them to the original exchange as this will cause a loop). That last queue will be consumed by a Rabbit shovel which re-publishes the messages to the original queue.
If by that time, the overfilled original queue backlog is reduced by the consumers, these TTL’ed messages will be enqueued and finally consumed.
One problem with this setup is with the ordering of the messages. Original ordering will be lost (if you are using multiple consumers it'd be lost anyway), so if you have strict ordering requirements enforced by a single consumer, you may want to implement consumer side re-ordering or listening to the “staging queue” as well and give precedence to it on the receiver side.
Here are the queue definitions of the test setup:
Original Queue (test):
TTL Queue (test_ttl):
Shovel Queue (test_shovel):
These queues are bounded to “direct” exchanges “test”, “test_ttl”, and “test_shovel” respectively with the routing key “test”.
It is important to note that this setup should go hand-in-hand with observability practices. Traffic metrics will help us when to increase the maximum message count limit, and at some point, scale the Rabbit instance itself.
Happy queuing! }}best fake rolex

I have a confession to make. I haven’t always been good at working with other women.
When I was an ambitious woman in my twenties, sexism was rampant. I read a book called Games Your Mother Never Taught You by Betty Lehan Harragan, and I learned that if I wanted to win at the game that was created by men, for men, then I had to act like one of them. I cut my hair. I never wore a dress. I went for pantsuits and tailored shirts. I didn’t want to draw attention to the fact that I was a woman. That would be career limiting. Having also been betrayed in high school by several close female friends, I’d “learned my lesson.” I mostly avoided women and hung out with the guys. It was easier.
I was in my early forties when I realized I had no close female friends. In fact, I was unconsciously competing with women for scarce promotions and professional gain. And that’s when I decided to ask myself some hard questions: Did I trust other women? Did I trust myself?
I felt isolated and alone. I wanted to learn how to be a good friend to other women.
I met Carol Zizzo in 2001 through a mutual acquaintance who thought that she and I should work together. At first, we didn’t get it. Carol was working in social services, and I was consulting to corporate America. These worlds were really far apart. What was our connection?
We discovered that we had a values match. And we realized that we both believe in the power of clear leadership, communication and purpose-driven contribution. Little by little, we began building a leadership development consulting firm together, and she became my business partner in 2010.
In our company, we’re clear about our vision and values. We honor our team’s lives outside of work and challenge them to bring their very best to work. We believe that everything works better if you just unplug for a few minutes – the power of creative mind-wandering. We are friends and co-workers and partners in the growth of our company.
Imagine a world where you come to work and you have these kinds of relationships with the men and women you work with. You work alongside one another on projects that matter. Your perspective and your view of things is encouraged and listened to by your bosses and your colleagues. You’re paid well. You leave work feeling well-used, not used up. Based on our own experience and that of many others, Carol and I believe that having more women in positions of leadership can lead to these kinds of empowering cultures.
Businesses Need Women Working Together
More and more studies also confirm the notion that we need more women leaders working together..
In other words, more women in charge means better business. For everyone. According to a recent McKinsey study, companies in the top quartile for racial and ethnic diversity are 35% more likely to have financial returns above their respective national industry medians. Additionally, a 2015 study referred to in this article from Bersin by Deloitte showed that diverse companies had 2.3 times higher cash flow per employee over a three-year period than non-diverse companies did.
These are only the tip of the iceberg. I could summarize a litany of studies showing the business value and bottom-line impact of women leaders, but the important thing for women leaders and aspiring leaders to remember is this: We need you. We need your voice and your perspective. We need your leadership and your vision. And we women need to work together to cause productive change.
What Gets in the Way of Women Working Well Together
Of course, it’s not as easy as just saying it. In an article for the American Management Association, Katherine Crowley and Kathi Elster highlighted some of the innate barriers that can get in the way of a productive relationship.
“Women’s tendency to bond with other women is a complicating factor when competitive feelings emerge at work,” they write. .”
Competition between women can disrupt communication and information sharing, which leads to lowered productivity, mediocre outcomes and high turnover. It can also feel as if you’re struggling with a personal failing rather than being caught in a cultural dynamic where women disempower other women.
Start Building Solid Relationships with Women at Work
Women have to learn how to work together in more empowering ways. That’s how we’ll become more creative, experience more job satisfaction, enjoy our work lives and build thriving companies. Here are a few ways we can become better partners at work:
- Build friendships with the people you work with. This means that you genuinely admire their skill and talents. You trust their values and ethics, and your friendship will ensure that you are equally committed to working through things with grace, especially those high-pressure, complex situations. It also means you have fun together! Fun and friendship are not luxuries. They’re a necessity. Spend time together, laughing at the outrageousness and excitement of the whole endeavor.
- Address conflict without collateral damage. If you aren’t running into conflict, you aren’t pushing your limits enough. Conflict isn’t bad; it is what happens when people see the world differently — and you want this. Addressing it without collateral damage is the secret to experiencing conflict that makes you better. Talk it through — what’s working, what’s not, and how you can improve. Don’t gossip or make personal attacks.
- Be responsible for your weaknesses. If you are incapable of seeing your weaknesses — particularly the things you do that are hard for the people you work with — then you will end up being defensive and a pain to work with. Any time you spend being defensive is time wasted. Own your part in whatever isn’t working. Then you will be able to de-escalate situations and move through them with grace. Your vulnerability is a necessary part of partnership.
Carol and I have created something truly remarkable. Together, we have withstood big setbacks personally and professionally. We talk nearly every day. We make every major decision together. I have learned how to be a good friend. Today, we are thriving and doing good work in the world.Our Customer Rating

The wires report that the two leaders will discuss a range of issues "including Middle East peace, combating extremism and other regional threats."
Here at Enough, we fully expect that any discussion of "other regional threats" will include pressure from the U.S. government on Egypt to participate in international efforts to support a comprehensive peace in Sudan. The Sudan Vision reported that "unnamed sources in Cairo" claim that President Mubarak plans to confer "sometime this month" with President Obama "in order to discuss the lifting of U.S.-imposed Sudan sanctions as well as issues to advance the peace process in Sudan. Mubarak’s move may be tied to the signs of a serious lack of coordination from the Obama administration (and significant disagreements between key officials) on U.S. policy toward Sudan. As Enough’s John Prendergast noted last week, "in the context of its policy review, President Obama should spell out a clear path forward for U.S. policy," which must include a number of priorities, including support for accountability, an issue relevant in the context of Egypt’s calls for suspension of the International Criminal Court case against Sudanese President Bashir. The key to a clear and successful U.S. policy must be leadership from the U.S. at the highest level, starting with the president himself. The meeting with Mubarak will be an opportunity to underline U.S. commitment to leading the international community on Sudan. We will have much more on the sanctions issue in the coming weeks, but President Obama should make one point crystal clear now and in his meeting with President Mubarak: that lifting U.S. sanctions on Sudan is not on the table.Massage Therapists Dallas massage therapists are so much more than just people who work away the pain and soreness in clients limbs and joints.

Digestive Complaints and Chinese Medicine
Updated: Aug 23
According to the ancient Chinese doctors, good health is based on what enters your body, what leaves your body – and a good rest at night. In other words: your diet, your digestion and your sleep. Though in our days, this approach might have become a bit too simplistic.
More and more people suffer from digestive problems that are linked to our body and mind being on constant ‘high alert’. Emotional stress, exhaustion, but also an overly sensitized immune system may cause a large number of food intolerances and digestive issues almost at any level of the digestive system, starting from mouth ulcers to acid reflux, GERD, stomach pain, ulcers, down to Colitis/ Crohn, gluten intolerance, and ending with haemorrhoids, just to name a few. Needless to say, it includes also the food-related illnesses such as high cholesterol, diabetes and to a certain extent, high blood pressure.
Chinese medicine (CM) looks at the sum of symptoms and will then make a diagnosis as to which areas of the body are not in balance. Let’s take the example of stomach ache. The questions would be: does it get better or worse with food? Worse in the morning or evening? Is the pain dull or sharp? Does it get worse during the week and better on weekends/ holidays? Do you get relief from a hot water bottle? Do you feel better after a bowel movement?
All these questions will draw a picture if your ailment is based on Excess, Stagnation or a Deficiency, on Heat or Cold. Once the picture is clear, it will likely be confirmed by other symptoms of your body, which typically include stress levels, sleep, energy levels, and more.
Acupuncture and Chinese herbal medicine will then work on moving Qi, tonifying deficiencies and releasing excess to re-balance your body and helping you to get back to a healthy system.
If you want to discuss your specific signs and symptoms and see what CM can do for you or want to make an appointment:

In accordance with the latest research performed by Phoenix Advertising International and Mobile Posse of 900 mobile phone users analyzed the complete client phone conference, attitudes, why and when people unlock their devices to ascertain their interest in “Proactive Content Discovery.” Have you learnt about Proactive Content Discovery and the way it is used? Well, Proactive Content Discovery will be described because the automatically opening of acceptable content when a phone is unlocked; making it the foremost display a user can see.
After this, more than 50.4% of all mobile customers expressed sturdy concern in the Proactive Content Discovery process and this group of people at the moment are called as “News Feeders.” This group is as huge as about 50.three% of all mobile use on Facebook principally for social communication with mates and family. In addition to this, mobile customers that often use their phones to make use of world news/ local/national, entertainment news and gossip are fifty six% more probably to be involved with the Proactive Content finding. Apart from this about 73% of mobile users don’t use their phones to devour local/national/world news, leisure news and gossip and are also not engrossed in Proactive Content Discovery.
Now coming to the unlocking situation of most new mobiles purchased are on contract from a mobile network brand will only be locked to that particular network. In different words, we will say only that a particular network’s SIM cards will work along with your decodare iphone and the phone is blocked from utilizing different network cards. Similarly, while unlocking is highly accepted within the used mobile cell phone market, there are nonetheless loads of brand-new unlocked phones sold by makers and mobile phone vendors. Jail-breaking may be very unusual for unlocking. What jailbreak actually offers is different from different firmware settings on the mobile to eliminate a wide range of restrictions that is likely to be in place.The "planning" phases of a project involve the crystallizing of project goals, the development of the concepts and technical requirements and planning for implementation. These activities typically require a number of iterations and re-runs to flush out the "customer's needs" and optimize project effectiveness. A definition of project leadership is proposed in the paper.
Consensus
Consent
The real work of task execution gets done in the implementation or "producing" phases of the project. In these phases, the focus is on efficiency in satisfying the customer(s) needs under classic project constraints. This is achieved through effective communications, the essential basis for project control. Thus, the key to success here is through efficient "managership" of the project.
Project leadership and project "managership" are both essential to project management success, and which is appropriate when is clearly tied to the project life cycle. A suitable collective term for describing the conduct of a project throughout its life cycle appears to be "project stewardship".
The style of "stewardship" must be responsive to the corresponding development of the project team as it moves towards an SDWT. Correlation in four progressive phases are described as well as a concomitant shift in decision making style from consensus to consent.
Thus, modern project leadership and project "managership" are both essential for managing projects in the 1990s and beyond. To be successful, project managers will do well to understand the nature of each and fit their style and decision-making according to the phase in the project life cycle.

August 23, 2018 by Darren LeMay in Analysis with 0 comments
There have been many storylines in pro disc golf this year and the ‘most improved’ category has been no different. Cases could be made for Garrett Gurthie’s return to the scene, or Drew Gibson and Kevin Jones playing at their highest level to date, or even Eagle McMahon finding a way to improve on what was already one of the best talents in all of disc golf. The most underrated and arguably most improved may very well be Rebecca Cox. She makes her first visit to Maple Hill this week, coming off a dominant win at Ladies at the Lake in Delaware, Ohio. That momentum — along with an impressive summer streak full of quality finishes — makes her a strong candidate to be near the top when it’s time to make the final, daunting approach shots into 18’s island green at the MVP Open and tap out near the sap house.
Cox’s rating has jumped 46 points in the last calendar year, starting out at 883 and hiking all the way up to her current 929. Many may remember her from winning a ‘Team Sockibomb’ sponsorship for the 2017 season. That season was her first touring nearly full-time with support from Ricky Wysocki’s team and Discraft. Last offseason she made the jump to Latitude 64 and added more events to her touring calendar.
Last season Cox played in 11 tournaments that were A-Tier or higher with an average finish just over 12th place. She also averaged 12th in the four Disc Golf Pro Tour events she played in. She competed in 20 PDGA sanctioned singles tournaments and cashed in half of them.
This year, however, Cox has improved dramatically. She has already played in 15 tournaments of A-Tier designation or higher with a fifth-place average finish. Those impressive figures include her first ever wins at an A-Tier which came in back-to-back weekends at the Two Days in May event at the Blockhouse in Spotsylvania, Virginia and the Tennessee State Championship. On the Disc Golf Pro Tour, she has averaged sixth place in six events played. Cox has already competed in 19 PDGA sanctioned singles tournament this year — just one short of her total from last season — and cashed in all but two of those.
It’s been a strong season of cashing checks and big finishes to this point, and her run this summer has been particularly impressive. Since May, Cox has played in 10 tournaments, cashing in all but one, and always finishing inside the top six, while collecting seven podium finishes. This bodes extremely well for her down the stretch with the biggest tournaments still to come. She may not be your first choice when making picks but she has been a lock to finish closer to first than the cash line for months now. As she continues to improve there is no doubt she will be making trips to the podium a regular occurrence.0 records | total pages 0

SENATE PRESIDENCY MOVING FROM CHANDLER TO SPILKA: Review of
18
REGIONAL
May
Letter from the Executive Director LAST MONTH WE EXPLORED A POSSIBLE NEW SERVICE, DEALT WITH MORE STAFFING WORK, AND EXPLORED ENGAGEMENT AROUND VARIOUS POLICY OPTIONS. The next possible service we would develop might be the “helpline,” which we’re modeling after the California Apartment Association (CAA). They have successfully created a way for their “premium plus” members to access legal information (never advice) via email. CAA shared with us a demo of their software. It gave us plenty to think about. There are questions here about how best to serve our population, which might not email as often as theirs. We also need to figure out how best to implement a helpline, given our relatively short stack of resources. April was a month of continued staffing work. We screened over 150 applicants for an “Information Manager” position. The role is to coordinate volunteer, staff, and vendor communications spread across our virtual office and, at time of writing, five time zones. You may know that MassLandlords exists because of the dedicated effort of a team of outsourced professionals in Uganda, Estonia, the Philippines, and India, as well as in Pennsylvania, Utah, and of course Massachusetts. We are actually a difficult company to work for, in the sense that we require an uncommon level of technical sophistication and work-from-home self-sufficiency. The process we now use to hire is successfully identifying technical strengths, we hope to onboard this new role soon. Our events are also a difficult job to staff, because they require travel, night work, and learning hundreds of names. We are grateful to our traveling registration desk staff person for helping us out while she could. We are now in need of a new team member. Policy-wise, April saw our semi-annual policy forum and the new possibility of a ballot initiative. We are extremely appreciative to owners who drove from up to two hours away to engage with us on a Saturday. The result of this forum is discussed in-depth in this May edition. By the time you read this, major decisions may have been made for us regarding rent escrow and Just Cause Eviction. Both of these will either be voted out of committee, killed, or extended on May 2. We will coordinate with the Greater Boston Real Estate Board and others to make the best of the opportunity we have. We will keep you posted. In the meantime, please consider becoming a property rights supporter. We will need this revenue stream to mobilize against Just Cause Eviction Rent Control, Right of First Refusal, and many other issues. Thank you for your support as we build the first professionally staffed trade association for landlords in Massachusetts. Sincerely, Doug Quattrochi hello@masslandlords.net

OWNERS CONTEMPLATE STATEWIDE BALLOT INITIATIVE at April Policy Forum By Peter Vickery, MassLandlords Legislative Affairs Counsel AN ALTERNATIVE TO FILING BILLS
MassLandlords members discussed the feasibility of a statewide ballot initiative or referendum at the April 14, 2018 policy forum. LET THE PEOPLE DECIDE? On Saturday April 14, at the MassLandlords policy forum in Southbridge, participants considered the question of what to do if the Legislature does not pass our rent-escrow bill, H.980. If enacted, H.980 would allow judges to order tenants who are withholding rent to set the money aside in an escrow account until the end of the case. The bill was designed to help solve the problem of the so-called “free rent trick:” an unscrupulous tenant can withhold rent on the spurious pretext 4 • MassLandlords Newsletter
of uninhabitable conditions and then – after trial, when the judge finds in favor of the landlord and orders the tenant to pay the months of accumulated rent – can plead penury and move on to the next hapless victim, having paid nothing. This is a real problem that hurts not just landlords but society as a whole. The rent-escrow proposal consistently ranks at the top of our rolling survey of members’ policy priorities. MassLandlords has been lobbying for H.980 because it was the product of negotiation and compromise with tenants’ advocates. Legislators of both parties agree that it is eminently reasonable. Opposition has been muted, and the hearings went well. But what if it dies in committee? Should we just try again next session (one more heave) or go another route?
The other route available to us is the ballot initiative. In Massachusetts, the voters can bypass the Legislature and enact laws directly. The process involves gathering approximately 80,000 certified signatures in two stages from registered voters across the Commonwealth the year before the statewide election and then, on election day, winning a majority of the votes. Many of the signatures will turn out to be un-certifiable, i.e. invalid, so experienced ballot-initiative campaigners prefer to obtain a cushion of at least 20,000 additional signatures. Persuading 100,000 people to sign a petition is a tall order A seasoned signature-gatherer can collect one signature every 10 minutes, i.e. about 50 signatures over the course of a full eight-hour working day. A dedicated team of 200 people working flat-out over three months would get the job done. More people working fewer hours would spread the load. Of course, the task of recruiting, training, and coordinating a large team of committed volunteers requires considerable resources in itself. But various interest groups manage to meet the challenge, which is why the statewide ballot always has questions on it. This year, for example, voters will decide whether to impose a surtax on incomes over $1 million, create a paid family-and-medical-leave fund, and raise the minimum wage. To achieve the formidable goal of obtaining more than 100,000 signatures in a matter of months, the groups backing these measures marshalled the necessary resources.
RENT ESCROW OUGHT TO HAVE BROAD APPEAL One of the most important resources in any campaign is the message. On the face of it, the message at the heart of
the rent-escrow bill should have broad appeal: Rent escrow will close a legal loophole, encourage rental propertyowners to provide homes for low-income tenants, and keep rents down. This is not spin. It is simple economics. The basic economic principle of supply and demand militates in favor of rent escrow. As things stand, the lack of a rent-escrow law hurts tenants. How? By forcing landlords to insure against the risk of the free-rent trick by raising rents. No reasonable person could claim that rent hikes make life better for tenants. And the existing rent-withholding law that allows (encourages, even) a few tenants to play the free-rent trick ultimately makes matters worse for the majority. When rents become unaffordable, people become homeless. The demand for housing stays the same, but the supply of affordable housing shrinks. Again, not spin, just the economic facts of life. But, as any lawyer will tell you, having the facts on your side does not guarantee success in front of a judge and jury. Facts matter even less in election
campaigns, where the decision rests with the court of public opinion. After all, the most important thing to remember about the court of public opinion is that it is not, in fact, a court. There are no rules of evidence to keep out irrelevant information, no rules of professional conduct to constrain the advocates on either side, no voir dire process for challenging and disqualifying jurors who harbor irrational biases, and no requirement that the jurors deliberate before reaching a verdict. All too often in ballot-question campaigns, facts take a back-seat to feelings.
MINIMUM WAGE AND THE COURT OF PUBLIC OPINION As an example of how facts can take a back-seat to feelings, let’s consider the minimum wage. Public policy professionals have long been aware of the counter-productive impact of minimum wage laws, which tend to hurt the very people they are supposed to help. Apart from certain labor unions whose contracts link their
pay to the minimum wage, not many workers realize any tangible benefits when the legally-mandated minimum wage goes up. Quite the contrary. In 2006, the economists William Neumark and David Wascher published “Minimum Wages and Employment: A Review of Evidence from the New Minimum Wage Research,” which (as the title suggests) looked at the results of scores of studies conducted by other researchers over the course of 15 years. Their three main conclusions? Minimum wage laws (1) reduce opportunities for low-skilled workers; (2) do not raise families out of poverty; and (3) inhibit skill acquisition, thereby suppressing earnings. In other words, the actual effect of the minimum-wage laws is the exact opposite of the intended effect. Nevertheless, in the face of all evidence to the contrary, politicians and activists persist in arguing that raising the minimum wage will improve the lot of ordinary working people. Here in Massachusetts, this year’s ballot question on the subject proposes raising the
May 2018
minimum wage to $15 per hour by the year 2022, and if the last few statewide ballot questions on similar subjects are anything to go by, it will pass handily. Why? Because the people who bear the cost – poor families in low-income neighborhoods – are not united or organized. The relatively few activists and politicians who put themselves at the forefront of the minimum wage campaign benefit from the appearance of helping. Ironically, the economic injury they cause to the many goes unnoticed by the court of public opinion.
DIFFUSE COSTS, CONCENTRATED BENEFITS In the realm of minimum-wage laws, the few reap rewards at the cost of the many. Landlords, too, have to reckon with this phenomenon of diffuse costs and concentrated benefits. The costs of higher rents and increasing homelessness are diffuse in that society as a whole suffers. Who picks up the tab? Taxpayers.
But because there is no line-item or check-box on the income-tax return marked “homelessness” we do not notice the costs. In contrast to the diffuse costs, the benefits of the status quo are concentrated. Just as raising the minimum wage tends to benefit a relatively small group (unions with contracts pegged to the minimum wage) leaving the rent-withholding law as it is tends to benefit a small but influential minority in the legal profession, i.e. the lawyers who make a living representing tenants. At the policy forum, attendees saw the dramatic dollar-and-power imbalance between landlords and the various taxpayer-and-foundation-funded entities that represent tenants. But we also learned that sometimes – just sometimes – victory goes to the shoestring campaign that relies on dedicated volunteers and small-dollar contributions. A canny, strategic, wellplanned campaign can prevail even against deep-pocketed special interests. It all comes down to commitment and organization.

Worcester Revisiting “FOUR OR MORE” RULE ON DENSITY Owners coordinating to reform long-standing prohibition on density in college housing, extended families. On April 10, the Worcester City Council forwarded a moratorium on the “four or more” rule concerning unrelated residents to the Economic Development Subcommittee. This is generally viewed as a favorable step towards reform. The “four or more” rule prohibits four or more unrelated occupants from cohabiting unless the premises have been licensed as a lodging house. In 2013, City of Worcester v. College Hill Properties, the state struck down the city’s application of MGL Ch. 140 Sections 22-31, the lodging house laws. The narrow ruling didn’t prevent the city from enacting its own zoning ordinance, which it did and has since enforced. Specifically, a “lodging house” under the City of Worcester Zoning Ordinance (as amended through May 2, 2017) is “A dwelling or that part of a dwelling where sleeping accommodations are let, with or without kitchen facilities, to four (4) or more persons not within the second degree of kindred to the person conducting it.” An owner with a legal four-bedroom who rents to four unrelated college students, or to a married couple, their child, and an aunt, could be cited for noncompliance. By count of bedrooms, approximately 300 properties in the city are currently enforced under capacity. At the April 10 hearing, Councilor George Russell echoed the concerns that led to the ordinance in the first place. Russell said the “four or more” rule was a helpful tool in code department’s toolbox for when college students throw a party or park illegally. The College of the Holy Cross neighborhood had a reputation for being unpleasant to live in before Holy Cross began screening students for off-campus

residency rights. The default is now that students must live on campus. Councilor Morris Bergman called for a moratorium on enforcement. Councilor Sarai Rivera cited the need to reform the ordinance. Both discussed the housing shortage, the high cost of housing, and the possibility of permitting greater density only in preexisting units. Worcester is home to nine colleges and universities. Worcester houses over 30,000 college students. It is not known whether the ordinance or Holy Cross administration was principally responsible for the improvement in the Holy Cross neighborhood. The Economic Development Subcommittee will examine whether existing city ordinances and the state sanitary code and building code may already provide the needed enforcement options, and whether the economic benefits outweigh any costs. At time of writing, the next meeting was scheduled for May 10. MassLandlords facilitated attendance at the hearing, and echoed
the recommendation at The City of Worcester Task Force for Sustaining Housing First Solutions (to address homelessness). “Housing is a spectrum, and we need to free up more of it if we’re to have any hope of housing extremely lowincome residents,” said MassLandlords Executive Director Doug Quattrochi. Owners are organizing grass-roots over the MassLandlords message boards. Interested owners are advised to join and/or contact their city councilors. ML

LANDLORD FINED $6,000, 3 YEARS’ PROBATION, for Forging Section 8 Documents, Gets off Easy Lawrence case highlights how traditional lawbreaking is now more forgivable than discrimination against Section 8. On April 9, a landlord with 16 units (not a MassLandlords member) pleaded guilty to forging occupancy permits and deleading certificates. Instead of jail time, his penalty is never renting to Section 8 again.
BACKGROUND AND FINE Edward Bonaccorsi II, owned a company called Essex Printing, which contracted with the City of Lawrence to print official documents. Bonaccorsi used extra stock to print and sign his own occupancy permits for his Lawrence units. He forged the signatures of inspectional services officers. He forged deleading certificates. He used the forged documents to apply for Section 8 money and rented to Section 8 tenants. The Attorney General said children under the age of six resided in the units with forged deleading certificates. It is unclear whether any were poisoned. MGL Chapter 267 Section 1 reads, “Whoever, with intent to injure or
defraud, falsely makes, alters, forges or counterfeits a public record, or a certificate… shall be punished by imprisonment in the state prison for not more than ten years or in jail for not more than two years.” But there was no jail time assigned. Superior Court Judge Timothy Feeley ordered that Bonaccorsi pay $6,000 in fines, be placed on probation for three years, and not receive any Section 8 benefits in Massachusetts ever again.
UNEVEN FINES INVITE BROADER DISCUSSION ABOUT SECTION 8 Bonaccorsi broke the forgery law in order to participate in Section 8, and received a penalty that amounts to a wrist-slap. On the other hand, an owner who breaks the discrimination law in order to avoid Section 8 can expect to pay $30,000 to $50,000 per incident, for some, a bankrupting amount. Does this unevenness make sense? It appears to suggest that you could pretend to really like Section 8, forge some documents, and then never have to deal with it again. (Do not forge documents, we’re just talking hypothetically.)
WHY A BAN ON SECTION 8 WOULD BE A DREAM COME TRUE FOR SOME
One of the Lawrence properties implicated in the forgery. Google Maps Street View.
When applying for an apartment, the first question a prospective Section 8 renter will ask a landlord is, “Do you take Section 8?” They know that the average owner doesn’t like the program. Consider the flaws of Section 8 as a subsidy: Lease-up takes longer than a market tenant, because two third-parties – the inspector and the administrator – must be scheduled and made to approve. Inspection outcomes vary by inspector. It is not possible to know
in advance whether you will pass, even if the unit recently passed another inspection. Owners must grant the federal government an indefinite, interest free loan in the event of a shutdown that halts payments. Leases cannot be signed electronically. Subsidy administrators cannot or will not say prior to lease signing what the tenant’s assistance payment will be. The formula is not made public. This greatly clouds lease-ups close to or above the rent reasonableness level. If there is a problem with the tenant, the administrators, who until the moment of lease signing had expressed their support toward owners, will suddenly say, “We can’t help. Do what you would with any market rate tenant.” Most significantly, there’s a perception (whether right or wrong is irrelevant) that Section 8 tenants are not worth the risk. MassLandlords tries to educate owners on the program, but most owners are not MassLandlords members.
FORGERY SUMMARY The judge’s sentence prohibiting participation in Section 8 reflects the state’s ignorance of how most landlords view the program. We should continue to vigorously prosecute fraud and fix the Section 8 program. Outsized discrimination fines and lenient forgery sentences show the backwardness of our priorities. ML

SENATE PRESIDENCY MOVING FROM CHANDLER TO SPILKA:
Review of Each On Housing
SPILKA’S WORK ON HOUSING Spilka has not yet connected with her local landlord group, which would be either the MetroWest Property Owners or the Charles River Rental Housing Association. In the current session, Spilka has sponsored only one housing-related bill: S.946 expanded the housing court to state-wide jurisdiction. Technically this bill was sent to study, but the essence of it and the geographic definitions were enacted in the FY18 budget, Chapter 47 of the Acts of 2017. Spilka received her Bachelors of Arts from Cornell, and her J.D. from Northeastern.
PREDICTING THE FUTURE Harriette Chandler's portrait for Simmons College, where she received her Masters of Business Administration.
Karen Spilka's state house portrait.
Senator Harriette Chandler (Worcester) will transition the role of Senate President to Karen Spilka (Ashland) this summer.
S.80 seeks to increase density by establishing the smart growth housing trust fund. S.81 seeks to increase density by providing training for local zoning boards of appeals. This bill was merged with H2420 into H4397 and reported favorably on April 11. S.715 seeks to increase density by turning smart growth loans into permanent grants. S.716 sought to enact just cause eviction on government-involved property, like Section 8 project-based vouchers. This bill was sent to study (deferred) on March 9. SD.2390 sought to enact a municipal right of first refusal in exchange for lower tax rates. Unlike the right of first refusal being discussed elsewhere, this proposal would be voluntary, between cities and elderly owners. Chandler received her Bachelors of Arts in 1959 from Wellesley, then a Ph.D. in international relations from Clark in 1973, and a Masters of Business Administration from Simmons in 1983.
On April 5, Senate President Harriette Chandler and Senator Karen Spilka jointly stated that the Senate Presidency would change hands on July 23.
CHANDLER’S WORK ON HOUSING Senator Chandler has a long history of listening to owners in the First Worcester district. It was her willingness to engage with the Worcester Property Owners Association and then-president Sandra Katz that ultimately led to MassLandlords’ appointment to the 2015 Senate Special Commission on Housing. That Commission’s recommendation for a landlord-tenant guarantee fund was the first of several consensus recommendations between landlords and tenants. In the current session, Chandler has sponsored a variety of housing-related bills. 18 • MassLandlords Newsletter
It is not possible to know whether Spilka will view housing as a priority, but to the extent that she will, it seems likely that owners will need to introduce themselves to her. For instance, landlord advocates like MassLandlords had tried to have housing court expansion tied to reform of rent escrow. Expansion happened without reform. Spilka’s ascendency may be somewhat of a coup, as Chandler had only recently acceded to the presidency and had expressed a wish to stay on through her term, to January 2. It is unclear why Spilka and supporters were unwilling to wait another six months. ML

Waltham: Sell Out and Wed Clean Up With Condo 05/02 Conversion; Screen Tenants with Public Eviction Histories Part I: We’ll go through step-by-step how to screen tenants using public eviction histories. Did you know that you can see where an applicant was last evicted, how long the eviction lasted, and even how much they owed the landlord? Court documents are a matter of public record and we can access them from the meeting room. When used appropriately, these records can provide a wealth of insight into whether a prospective tenant will be successful in your apartment. This segment will show how to search by tenants and owners, how to read the information presented, and most importantly, how to talk to prospective renters and owners to find out whether the case does in fact reflect badly on either party. The tenant or the landlord might be to blame, or maybe it was an unfortunate breakdown in communication on both sides. This portion will be brass-tacks training for owners and managers.

REGIONAL This part will be presented by Victor Divine, REALTOR; David Camiel, Attorney; Jeremy Wong, Contractor, at CW Builders; and Jeremy Devaney, Loan officer at Fairway Mortgage. This team have performed many condo conversions together and they’re going to tell us how the process works and what to watch out for. Member Testimonial
I only had a vague notion of condo conversion until I stumbled into one of Victor’s seminars. Suddenly it became a real possibility. I kicked myself for not figuring it out sooner. He answered a lot of questions for me that evening and afterwards. He even prepared a report including estimated market value for each unit. Victor never put the slightest pressure on me to convert. He just helped me understand my options. – Rex
Condos can happen anywhere 2ND
Screen tenants with eviction histories Part II: Thinking about selling? How would you like to increase the market value of your three-decker by 50%? Condo conversion can make this happen. As we all know, single families are priced based on what buyers can afford, not based on the rental income they could generate. A two- or three-unit building split into condos might instantly be worth hundreds of thousands of dollars more to you, if you’re willing to sell two or three times instead of once. Whether now’s the time or you’re just gathering information, this is our chance to learn about a great option.: Screen Tenants with Public Eviction Histories 7:25pm Part II: Sell Out and Clean Up with Condo Conversion 8:20pm Networking 9:00pm Doors Close

Your Event Here Contract partners can list their events by sending details to services@masslandlords.net. Not a MassLandlords partner? Here’s how it works. MassLandlords, Inc. is a 501(c)6 nonprofit trade association with a mission to create better rental housing in Massachusetts. We help new, current, and prospective owners and managers run profitable, compliant, and quality businesses. We also advocate for appropriate changes to the laws. We grew up out of the Worcester Property Owners Association as the old Massachusetts Rental Housing Association declined. We’re basically the same movement with a new economics model. Instead of trying to influence policy with grassroots alone, we’re offering economically valuable services to sustain a core of professional staff. Staff can organize the grassroots and drive change like the REALTORS do. Our service contract is simple. For a percentage of dues revenue, we will help your club or association with payment processing (credit cards and checks), marketing, membership lists, renewals, and much more. No group is too small! All your members will get access to MassLandlords benefits, including our rental forms, message boards, service provider directory, savings at retailers like Home Depot, savings on credit scores, a free trial with RentHelper, discounts on fixed price entity formation with New Leaf Legal, and all other services we have or may add in the future. Our typical partner holds occasional or regular meetings for education and networking and annual democratic elections for a board of directors. We are especially looking to talk to groups listed at very bottom of MassLandlords.net/Chapters, which used to participate in the old MRHA model. Interested? Introduce yourself by emailing at hello@masslandlords.net

March 18, 2021 | 11:39 am CDT
Photo By Kellex Seating
A shortage of foam has forced production and hour cutbacks for several furniture manufacturers.
The two chemicals used in foam production are primarily produced at plants in Texas and Louisiana. Many of these facilities were forced offline by the deep freeze that slammed the region late February.
Furniture makers are feeling the effect.
North Carolina-based Craftmaster Furniture says it was forced to cut production to three days a week. Century Furniture has cut production hours down a half day or full day each week.
Mississippi's Affordable Furniture, which employs 300 at its plant, told the Mississippi Daily Journal it's working just four days a week. Commercial furniture maker Kellex Seating says it's facing a "severe supply chain shortage."
Several furniture makers, including High Point Furniture Industries and Lorts Manufacturing, have decided to raise prices.
The shortage comes at a time when business is good. Residential furniture orders saw a 27 percent rise in December 2020 from the same month in 2019, and a 15 percent increase for entire year of 2020 over 2019.

The Bank for International Settlements (the central bank of central banks) has sharpened its knives, but BIS cannot have it both ways. Simultaneous de-leveraging in the public and the private sectors would lead to a serious economic set-back, possibly even a 1930s style depression. Meanwhile, nobody can afford for interest rates to rise, so expect central banks to fight the recent trend with all the tools at their disposal. But can they actually control the yield at the long end of the curve? That’s the big question.The 2014 Klondike Derby had two patrols from Troop 45, among the 59 entries at scout camp. Both teams had a ton of fun and spawned numerous compliments from other troop leaders. Our patrols did an awesome job!
Pheasant Tree Patrol
Hiking Meese Patrol
I’d especially like to congratulate the patrol leaders from each patrol. Way to go, JD and CC!
Hiking Meese
While I only got to see the boys at the cooking station where I was helping, the Hiking Meese definitely set an amazing impression on all the judges. In fact, their judge kept walking around teasing everyone else with samples of the food the boys shared with him! They pulled off a difficult back-woods meal with French fries and burgers, with style, while managing with a last minute dropout from the patrol.
“The 4 hour meal ‘prep /cook/devour’ of cheese burgers and french fries earned the older team 99 out of 100 points!!!! WAY TO GO!!! Always proud of all of Troop 45!!” — Sandy
Pheasant Tree
The judge for Pheasant Tree Patrol tracked me down after they left. Her comment was that she had never seen such safe food handling anywhere, let alone outdoors. She said that the boys asked her if she wanted to share some of their food before they started cooking – she said “no.” But by the end of their gourmet meal with field fried donuts and sausage patties that they ground themselves, she said she seriously regretted not trying any. They did an awesome job, especially since they had a last minute replacement: They did a good turn by welcoming a boy from another troop. That boy’s troop didn’t attend, but he really wanted to try the Klondike Derby for the first time.
“We sure do have a lot of great cooks in our Troop 45! The Pheasant-Tree patrol also scored 99/100 with their menu of sausage sandwiches with peppers & onions and fried donuts for dessert. Additionally they had time to go to 6 other stations. Way to go ALL of Troop 45!” –ChadIn iiko, stock list items are products (or goods), menu items (items), prepared components (or semi-finished products), modifiers, and services. To open a complete stock list, go to Inventory management > Stock list.
Use Inventory management items to access corresponding inventory units. The services are separated from this list and are given as a special reference in the Finances section.
Each type of inventory (stock list items) has a special icon:
Products are foodstuffs (flour, sugar, potato) used to cook menu items, modifiers, and semi-finished products, or ready-to-eat items (chocolate, coca-cola, bottled water) that are purchased and sold as is.
Items are meals that are cooked to a recipe and served to guests. An item consists of ingredients and has a recipe. Like clam chowder, Caesar salad or coleslaw.
Modifiers are menu item options or additives like condiments. For instance, Steak has several modifiers for doneness and ice-cream may have various toppings. A modifier may have a recipe and consist of ingredients.
Prepared components are pre-prepared foodstuffs or semi-finished products consisting of ingredients and used in cooking. For instance, peeled potato, dough, grated cheese.
Services and rates are services you or your contractors provide to your guests, e.g., pool, delivery, rent.
Groups are categories used to unite similar stock list items. A group may contain not only items but other groups as well.
Depending on whether a stock list item has a recipe or whether it is on sale, it takes an additional icon:
A stock list may have a tree view or table view which you can choose in the View menu. The icons are shown under the tree view.
Item properties are given in columns and can be shown or hidden. For this, click View and check the Columns settings item opposite the columns you are interested in.
Suppose a cost accountant creates a detailed recipe and can control the markup using the following indicators:
Use the reference book to run reports on the nutritional and energy value of items. For this, in the Actions menu, select the required report.
On the right-hand side of the window, hover the cursor over the Outlets tab to see the pop-up table. It provides prices set in the chain outlets according to the basic price change orders.
You can create a new order from the reference book window. For this, select the required items or groups using the Ctrl key and click the Price change order shortcut menu item. If you select a stock list group or groups, all items in these groups will be included in the new order.
The stock balance information is only available to users with the “View inventory reports” permission (B_VSR).
This article covers basic stock list operations: copying, moving, editing, deleting and recovering. For how to create and set up a group, product, item, etc., refer to the Stock List Group and Stock List Item articles.
To quickly find a stock list item, enter its name in the Search bar.
Search results are displayed in different ways subject to the reference book view:
Sometimes its easier to copy existing items rather than to create new ones. Select an item that is similar to the one you want to create and click Actions > Copy. This opens a new item page where fields are populated the same way as they are in the source item except for the Name, Stock list code, and Quick code. Fill up these fields manually and click Save and Close.
You can move stock list items from one group to another. There are three ways to do it:
Use this feature to edit several stock list items at a time. You don’t have to open each page one by one. For this, press and hold Ctrl or Shift, select the required items, and click Actions > Edit. The Edit stock list items window pops up.
Here fields are populated with the values that selected items share. An empty field means that selected items do not have the same value in this field or it wasn’t set at all.
If you want all the items to have the same parameter in a particular field, specify the required value in this field and click Save.
A list of modifiers can be set up on the item’s page. It’s easy to edit items with the same modifiers as a group. For this, select items by pressing and holding Ctrl or Shift and click Actions > Edit modifiers.
If selected items have different modifiers, this window shows all of the modifiers rather than only matching ones.
The For all field shows whether this modifier is shared by all items ‒ , by some items ‒ , and by no items ‒ . To delete a modifier in all selected items, uncheck the For all field and click Save.
If all items have the number of modifiers restricted in the same manner, this table shows the value. If those values are not the same, the fields are empty.
To set the same number of modifiers for all the items, enter the value in the empty field. If you leave it blank, existing values will be used.
To add a simple or group modifier to all items, click Add and select the required modifier as described in the Modifiers article.
You can remove any item from the reference book. For this, select the required items on the list and click Actions > Delete.
If you try to delete items that have a non-zero stock balance, the program will show a warning:
In reference books, reports, and documents, deleted items are stricken through. Reports and documents always show deleted items, and their quantities and prices are included in calculations.
To see deleted items, click View > Show deleted.
You can always restore deleted items. For this:Simple Nachos

You are listening to a presentation, and a chart pops up on the screen. The first thought that comes to your mind? Confusion. You look around the room wondering if anyone else has a clue what this colorful enigma is supposed to represent. Instead of trying to decipher the cryptic code, you slowly lift your phone and begin to check email.
This is an all to common trend we see in conference rooms every day. We now have a sea of data pouring in from everywhere in our digital and non-digital worlds, but there is one critical element we continue to overlook. Making sense of that data to drive actionable insights. Lucky for you there is a repeatable process to building great data visualizations that do just that (Spoiler Alert: You don’t need any specialized tools to make it happen!).
With St. Patty’s Day right around the corner, we are going to have some fun with a public dataset about Irish Whiskey Sales to demonstrate how to bring your data viz to life through the following process:
For the purpose of the exercise, let’s pretend we are an analyst at an Irish Whiskey distillery. We are tasked with providing a recommendation to the president of the company as to whether we should expand our business to the United States or Ireland. Let’s start with the “before” data visualization picture. Don’t worry, we can only go up from here…
There are many types of visualizations out there: bar, stacked bar, line, scatterplot, slope graph, heatmap, waterfall, square area, pie and even simple text. For the purpose of this post, we will focus on bar and line charts. (I will save my disdain of pie charts for another time…)
Our visual is leveraging a stacked bar chart to display the historical trend of Irish Whiskey sales by volume across 10 countries. Stack bar charts work wonders when comparing across categories while also being able to see a portion of that category. However, what we truly need to understand here is the relative nature of the sales by country across a given time period. For that purpose, the line chart is a great fit. It allows the audience’s eye to easily understand the relative volume of whiskey sales across the countries in the visualization.
With Spring cleaning right around the corner, the next step is fitting. There are three major changes we can make to our visualization to prevent our audience from getting a headache.
Where and how you focus the audience’s attention is your chance to either flip the light bulb on in their head or leave them in the dark. You want to guide your audience so their “ah-ha” moment comes before you even tell them.
There are several tactics you can leverage to do this, but we will focus on color, intensity, and spatial position for now. For some odd reason, people turn into Picasso when creating a data visualization adding as many colors as PowerPoint will allow. DO NOT DO THIS. Unnecessary color only distracts your audience from the story you are trying to tell.
In our example, our decision point is whether to expand to the United States or Ireland. For that reason, let’s focus our attention there by making the United States blue and Ireland green. Note, we are using colors that are associated with the countries to make it easier to understand.. For the purpose of this exercise we don’t care how the other countries are performing. However, they do provide a good reference point. For that reason, lets group them all together with a light grey color. The low intensity of this color does not distract our audience from what they should be focusing on.
Last, we can move our labels next to the actual line. This change in spatial positioning makes it easier for our audience to reference the country they are looking at.
Now let’s bring it all together and make our data visualization come to Life. The most critical step is knowing your audience and their objective. In our case, we are presenting to the president of the company who wants a recommendation on where we should expand next. The headline of the chart is the perfect place to communicate our actionable insight we have uncovered. In our final visualization, you will note we effectively leverage color in our title to associate the United States and Ireland to their respective lines. Next, we directly annotate an inflection point in the visualization where the United States surpassed Ireland in volume of Irish Whiskey sales. This helps reinforce our point.
In today’s world, everyone is a data person whether you like it or not. Embrace it. By using this process, you will be able to make sense of your data and drive actionable insights.

I didn’t bash any races, I didn’t write racist characters and I didn’t mess around with life styles. Everyone was straight, wore clothes all the time and even the bad guys kept curse words behind their teeth.
Golly that was a long time ago! Also, all those manuscript are sitting in an attic, as relics of a childhood. Fond memories but not worthy of publication.
There seems to be, historically, rules placed upon speculative fiction, at least the generally known representatives of it, that allow for the imaginative genius to explore, flora, fauna, political systems and disotopia but a few subjects have seemed taboo, for the majority. Under taboo I would place, marriage and expanded versions of sexuality.
Speculative fiction is for the opening of the mind and the imagination. But how open are we actually, as a speculative fiction community? This thought came to mind when I was reading “The Incidentally Gay Character” by Inconvenient Muse. Go check out her post. It’s charming.
Personally, I went round and round with three of my characters for six months before giving in an acknowledging that they had a stable, long term, mutually agreed upon threesome. Looking back now, I wonder why I resisted so hard. I’m open to alternative lifestyles, though I don’t live one right now. Plenty of my friends are outside the straight and narrow norm that I grew up with. So what was my hang up?
One of my conclusions is that’s is simple social programming. We’re taught things are a certain way and until it really hits most of us between the eyes, even though we may personally not have any strong convictions on a subject, we’re going to keep going along with what we’ve been given approval to believe something else. We need and want approval because at our base natures, we’re social creatures. As we’ve evolved, belief systems have become important for deciding who to include or exclude from the “tribe”.
Acceptance is the reward for keeping our minds shut and our mouths blathering on the accepted refrain. Fortunately for many of us now, we can find a tribe now, that accepts whatever it is that we feel drawn to. If we’re brave enough to get up and go find one.
I’ve been fortunate. Even though part of my original reasoning for taking a pen name was to avoid shaming my parents in their social circles, they’ve both encouraged me in my writing and my life, whether or not they want to be a part of it. I’ve never had a verbally violent conversation with anyone in my past over social issues an my dynamic change in world view. Some people don’t know because they assume that I have continued to believe whatever it is that they believe. Others have simple drifted away when I didn’t cough up the same fervor for the old prejudices.
Today, I write as my character are inclined to go. It has led to some very interesting places and often challenges me personally. I’ve enjoyed the journey.

Franklin and the Presbyterians
Freedom of ConscienceVersus The Need for Order Creighton University
Benjamin FranklinIN SEPTEMBER 1734, SAMUEL HEMPHILL received an interim appointment to the position of assistant minister to the Reverend Jedediah Andrews of Philadelphia. Hemphill had studied at the University of Glasgow before moving to the British Colonies of North America, and he was recommended to the Presbyterian Synod of Philadelphia by the Ulster Presbytery of Strabane, by whom he had been received in 1729. He brought "ample and satisfactory certificates" of his qualifications for the ministry, and, on September 21, 1734, upon subscribing to the Westminster Confession and Catechisms, he was admitted to the synod. Within a year, however, Samuel Hemphill stood accused of preaching heterodox sermons and of defying synod orders to desist in such activity. 1 Hemphill was neither the first nor the last eighteenth century Presbyterian minister to be charged with heterodoxy, but the timing of his infraction and his making the case public, attracting the support of Benjamin Franklin, assured that it would become a cause célèbre. At issue, especially for the Synod of Philadelphia, was the classic dilemma of American religious history -- striking a balance between freedom of conscience and the need for order.2 Controversy was not new to Samuel Hemphill. He had difficulties in Ireland before moving to the colonies. According to Franklin, Hemphill and the Reverend Patrick Vance had preached on the same biblical text on different Sundays to a congregation in Burt, in the North of Ireland. Upon hearing that his views on the subject differed from Hemphill's, Vance accused Hemphill of heterodoxy and instigated the process by which he was brought before their synod. At length, Franklin reported, Vance confessed that he had misrepresented Hemphill in a "vile manner," and he pledged "to use all the means in his power to inform his neighbors of the truth." The synod took no action against Hemphill.3 Vance wrote of the affair in a letter to his brother-in-law J. Kilpatrick in Pennsylvania. In that letter, Franklin reported, Vance accused Hemphill of heresy, used "all the invidious names that malice could invent," and recommended that he not be installed as a minister in America. According to Franklin, upon Kilpatrick's circulating Vance's letter, Hemphill was labeled a "New Light Man, a Deist, one who preached nothing but morality, [and] a missionary sent from Ireland to corrupt the faith once delivered by the saints," but, in fact, as already noted, the Synod of Philadelphia did not reject him. The Presbytery of Newcastle, of which Hemphill was a member before joining Andrews in Philadelphia, raised questions as to the orthodoxy of two sermons he had delivered in New London, Pennsylvania, but, once again, "nothing was provided to his disadvantage."4 Reactions to Hemphill's preaching in Philadelphia were mixed. Franklin, who normally preferred to contemplate the eternal in the privacy of his own home, had been invited by Jedediah Andrews to become a member of the Presbyterian church. He attended for five Sundays in a row. He became a pew holder and a contributor, but he nevertheless ceased to attend weekly services, finding Andrews' sermons "dull, uninteresting, and unedifying," as well as sectarian. As Franklin put it, Andrews' sermons seemed aimed at making good Presbyterians rather than good citizens. Attracted back to the church by news of its new minister, Franklin found merit in Hemphill's sermons and reported that they were "universally applauded." When Andrews brought charges against Hemphill, Franklin lent him his pen.5 Others in the congregation, however, objected to Hemphill's sermons, and they boycotted his services. Matters grew worse during the winter of 1734/35, and by spring, Franklin reported, Jedediah Andrews was going "from house to house among his congregation, declaring Hemphill ... a Deist, Socinian, and the like." Whether or not Franklin's account is accurate in every detail, or biased to some extent, on April 7, 1735, at a meeting of the Synod of Philadelphia, Andrews formally charged Hemphill with erroneous teaching. Ten days later his trial began.6 IN HIS AUTOBIOGRAPHY, WRITTEN A HALF-CENTURY LATER, Franklin devoted only two paragraphs to the Samuel Hemphill affair. He described Hemphill as "a young Presbyterian preacher ... with a good voice, and apparently extempore, most excellent discourses, which drew together considerable numbers of different persuasions." Hemphill's sermons, Franklin continued, had "little of the dogmatical kind, but inculcated strongly the practice of virtue, or what in the religious style are called good works." When members of the congregation who considered themselves orthodox Presbyterians, along with "most of the old clergy," accused Hemphill of heterodoxy and attempted to silence him, Franklin explained, "I became his zealous partisan, and contributed all I could to raise a party in his favor, and we combated for him a while with some hopes of success."7 In general, most Franklin scholars have found him to be quite moderate in his attitude toward religion. Typically, Alfred Owen Aldridge has described Franklin as a confirmed Deist, who, in contrast to more militant Deists like Tom Paine, did not attempt to "wither Christianity by ridicule or bludgeon it to death by argument." His behavior in the Samuel Hemphill affair, however, provides at least one major exception to that description.8 That theological differences lay at the heart of the Hemphill affair is clear, but other attributes of the Presbyterian Church moved Franklin to make his criticism public. As Alfred Owen Aldridge has suggested, Franklin's Hemphill pamphlets were informed by anticlericalism, but his animus was especially directed at those whom he believed to be narrow sectarians within the denomination. In a passage from his private correspondence with his more orthodox sister, Jane Mecom, for example, Franklin chastised Presbyterians for their "bigotry and utter lack of charity toward any who disagree[d] with them."9 During the Hemphill affair, Franklin's public pronouncements were less than balanced and even-handed. Merton Christensen has argued that Franklin's role in the affair shows Franklin to be less thoroughly secular and more anti-clerical than has been sometimes supposed. Melvin Buxbaum has used stronger language, describing Franklin as a polemicist who "was as guilty of censoriousness and bigotry as he accused Presbyterians of being." That Franklin would later, in his Autobiography, offer such a brief and unemotional account of the affair, Buxbaum has explained, was "a public relations piece not only for himself but for America" in which he endeavored to create a hero who was "a typical American of the kind he wanted to see settle in his country." Unpleasant truths from his own life were ignored or altered in favor of a higher ideal, and nowhere was this more evident than in Franklin's portrayal of himself as "a benevolent live-and-let-live Deist who does well by working hard and doing good for his fellow men regardless of such matters as their station in life, politics, or religion," or as "the Deist who, in his benevolence, is a friend to all religions and sects, though a member of none himself."10 THE HEMPHILL AFFAIR, OF COURSE, WAS NOT Benjamin Franklin's first public bout with Calvinist clerics. In 1722, at age sixteen and while still living in Boston and working as an apprentice to his brother James, editor of the New England Courant, Benjamin wrote his satirical "Dogood Letters." Employing the voice of Silence Dogood, an "enemy to vice and a friend to virtue," Franklin criticized what he saw as an authoritarian and dangerous Calvinist establishment. In one "Dogood" letter, for example, he described Harvard educated New England ministers as "little better than dunces and blockheads," and their sole preparation for learning as their families' wealth. In another, he suggested that they were not even true to their own particular religious group, in that they plagiarized from Anglican divines; and, in a third, he cited their own "indiscreet zeal" as the cause of the growing disaffection from their ranks.11 Franklin's entry into the fray on behalf of Samuel Hemphill followed the Philadelphia Synod's meeting of April 7, 1735, where it formally brought charges against Hemphill and appointed a commission to conduct a hearing on the matter. "A Dialogue Between Two of the Presbyterians Meeting in this City," appeared in the April 3-10, 1735, issue of his Pennsylvania Gazette.12 In this his first defense of Samuel Hemphill, Franklin chose not to refute the specific charges brought against Hemphill by the synod. Instead, Franklin represented him as "a lover of virtue who considered particular orthodoxies and religious enthusiasm irrelevant and potentially inimical to sound religion and human happiness." Morality, he insisted, should be the principal goal of preaching, and faith, which the Presbyterians had emphasized, was merely a means of producing morality. To expect salvation from faith alone, he reasoned, especially where it does not lead to virtue, was neither a Christian nor a reasonable doctrine.13 Where his critics had argued that Hemphill ought to have preached "as Presbyterians use[d] to preach," and abide by the Westminster Confession of Faith, Franklin asked whether preachers should be confined to that or any other confession. Confessions, he suggested, represent the church's apostasy from the primitive simplicity of the gospel. They are the product of fallible people, the most recent and most directly applicable case being that of the Presbyterians. They were not satisfied with the Church of England's Thirty-Nine Articles, Franklin explained, and, "fancying themselves infallible in their interpretations," they had tied themselves to the Westminster Confession.14 The Westminster Confession had been central to the Presbyterian Church since its adoption by Parliament in 1648, but its history in British America begins with its adoption by the Synod of Philadelphia in 1729, following nearly a decade of at times heated debate.15 The subscription controversy, as it came to be known, arose when, in response to its failure to attract confessionally orthodox clergy, the Synod of Philadelphia proposed to make subscription to the Westminster Confession a prerequisite for ministerial ordination. It soon gave rise, however, to a crucial encounter between those who sought to impose institutional Old World authority on those with sufficient New World experience to resist such overtures. The Westminster Standards, which included the Confession, were the product of the seventeenth century Puritan Revolution. A Calvinistic scheme of Christian doctrine, they placed the reformed churches of England in a unique position between those established by the Thirty-Nine Articles and the Synod of Dort. The Standards were created by the Westminster Assembly of Divines and adopted by Parliament, only to be set aside when episcopacy, the Thirty-Nine Articles, and the Book of Common Prayer were restored in 1660.16 In England, Puritan groups, including Presbyterians, continued to accept the principles of the Standards, but they did not insist upon subscription to the Confession for ministerial candidates. As late as March 1719, on the eve of the subscription controversy in America, English nonconformist ministers meeting at London's Salters Hall could not agree on a requirement for ministerial subscription. Though called in response to growing fears of Arianism, Socinianism, and other heresies, suggesting that "such human words were necessary to insure the purity of the church," two-thirds of the Presbyterians present remained opposed.17 In Scotland and northern Ireland, however, where the Presbyterian churches were more directly descended from the Continental, rather than the English, Reformation, in general, and the Knoxian tradition, in particular, the Standards were maintained in all respects. By custom, beginning in 1647, most ministers subscribed to the Confession and the rest were understood to be in agreement with it. In 1690 that custom was written into law by vote of the Scots Parliament and General Assembly. Similarly, in 1698, the Synod of Ulster ruled "that young men, when licensed to preach, were to be obliged to subscribe the Confession of Faith, in all the articles thereof, as the confession of their faith." In 1705 subscription was extended to ministerial candidates, and, in 1716, the Synod of Belfast passed a similar measure.18 OPPOSITION AND PROBLEMS AROSE almost immediately after acceptance of subscription in both Scotland and northern Ireland. In 1719, for example, John Abernathy, founder of the Belfast Society, voiced his opposition to subscription in Religious Obedience Founded on Personal Persuasion. "Christian communion should not be based upon the conformity of one's beliefs to the mainstream," he wrote, but upon the sincerity, as judged by the reasonableness, with which a Christian seeks the truth."19 In 1721, at the Synod of Belfast, the Reverend Samuel Haliday refused to subscribe to the Westminster Confession. Haliday had assented to the confession in Rotterdam, was licensed, and had testimonials to the soundness of his doctrines from ministers in Rotterdam, London, and elsewhere. The year before he had been charged by a fellow minister with having joined the Arian party at the Salters Hall assembly of 1719, but Haliday rejected the charge and was vindicated. When asked by the Synod of Belfast if he still adhered to the assent he had given to the Westminster Confession when he was licensed, however, he refused to commit himself.20 Haliday did not take this stance, he explained, because of any disbelief on his part of the important truths contained in the Westminster Confession. Rather, he opposed "submittance to human tests to divine truth, when imposed as a necessary term of Christian and ministerial communion," and, wherein, there were "a great number of extra essential truths, without the knowledge or belief of which man could be entitled to the favor of God and the hope of eternal life, and according to the laws of the gospel, to Christian and ministerial communion."21 Although in this case the Synod of Belfast disclaimed all power of imposing on a man's conscience and indulged Haliday, it did not abandon its ordinances requiring ministerial subscription. Instead, it and the Synod of Ulster wavered between non-imposition and complete acceptance, the latter passing and then rejecting, for example, what were known as the Pacific Articles. The Pacific Articles were adopted by the Ulster Synod of 1720, reaffirming its Act of 1705, but also allowing "scruples" provided they did not alter the fundamental faith of the Westminster Confession. Specifically, they read that if a ministerial candidate should "scruple" any phrase of the confession, he would "have leave to use his own expression," which the presbytery could accept if it found the person "sound in faith" and the expression "consistent with the substance of doctrine." The Pacific Articles were withdrawn in 1723, and, in 1726, when they failed to effect a compromise on the synod's imposition of subscription, a group of non-subscribers, called "New Lights," withdrew, "having been excluded," and formed the Antrim Presbytery.22 Presbyterians from northern Ireland were by far the largest group of immigrants to join the Presbyterian Church in English Colonial America. Lured to northern Ireland from Scotland in substantial numbers during the first half of the seventeenth century, they met with increased restrictions, even persecution, after restoration of the Stuarts in 1660, whereupon they began their migration to the British Colonies of North America. Their numbers increased dramatically after 1717 in the face of drastic rent increases meted out by their Anglo-Irish landlords, governmental commercial mismanagement, and famine. By the late 1740s the Ulster Scots were arriving at a rate of 12,000 per year. Total immigration figures for the Colonial Period have been estimated at between 200,000 and 250,000, mostly through ports in the Middle Colonies. They would come to comprise approximately one-third the population of the colony of Pennsylvania.23 Ministers of this extension of the Church of Scotland, as well as those Presbyterians who migrated directly from Scotland, brought with them their practice of subscription which was as yet unsettled in their homeland and, probably, within their ranks. They joined the earlier and smaller movement of Presbyterianized Congregational New Englanders, whom, in the Synod of Philadelphia, as early as the second decade of the eighteenth century, they outnumbered by a margin of two to one. This set the stage for one of the major events in what Leonard Trinterud has described as the "fiery ordeal of ecclesiastical controversy and spiritual awakening," out of which was born "a new order, an American understanding of Presbyterianism."24 New Englanders accepted the principles of the Westminster Confession. This they stated in the Cambridge and Savoy Platforms of 1649 and 1658, and more explicitly in the Saybrook Platform of 1708. Like their English counterparts, however, they objected to any requirement by which they were to subscribe to the Confession, or any part therein, as a doctrinal standard. New Englanders continued to oppose subscription decades after they moved to the Middle Colonies and helped establish the Presbyterian Church, therein, it has been alleged, because they feared that by their advocacy of subscription the recently arrived Scots and Ulster Scots intended to place American Presbyterianism under the ultimate control of either the Synod of Ireland or the General Assembly of Scotland.25 Although there is no record of it, the Presbytery of Philadelphia may have adopted the Westminster Confession as a doctrinal statement at its founding in 1706. Some of the minutes of its first meeting have been lost. The records thereafter, however, make it clear that there was no formal consideration of ministerial subscription to the confession by that body or by the Synod of Philadelphia, which succeeded it, until 1721. At that point, some members of the synod began to call for subscription as the only means by which they might eliminate the earthly as well as the spiritually unsound from their ranks.26 Those who became subscriptionists cited a long list of ministerial infractions, and they believed that punishments in such cases given out by the Synod of Philadelphia were insufficient. Many members of the synod also feared the dangers of Arminianism, Antinomianism, and other heresies that they believed were ever present to prey upon their weaknesses. They argued that the examination of ministerial candidates had become a mere formality, and that their spiritual status was being taken for granted. They pointed out that the absence of locally trained ministers had led to their dependence on Great Britain for clergy, and that although at first they had been confident of the doctrinal soundness of the new arrivals, as of late, their suspicions had been aroused. In 1721, George Gillespie -- a Scot, in the largely Ulster Scot Presbytery of Newcastle -- with the support of his presbytery, save four New Englanders and two Welshman, acted on those suspicions and presented an overture to the Synod of Philadelphia, wherein he called for ministerial subscription to the Westminster Confession.27 On April 30, 1722, the Reverend Jedediah Andrews, formerly of Massachusetts, then pastor of the Presbyterian church in Philadelphia, wrote to the Reverend Benjamin Colman, Presbyterian minister of Boston, apprising him of what transpired at the Synod of 1721. He referred to a protest made by fellow New Englander Jonathan Dickinson, then pastor of the Elizabeth Town, New Jersey Presbyterian Church, in response to Gillespie's overture, and to the wound he was attempting to heal. "I know not but the Pacific Articles have had their good use," he added, suggesting that the articles had by then at least been considered as a means of healing that wound. Andrews reported that he believed the quarrel between the two sides to be over "words," for, having considered the matter in several letters which had passed between Jonathan Dickinson and himself, he could find no real differences.28 WHEN THE SYNOD OF PHILADELPHIA met in September 1722, Jonathan Dickinson preached the opening sermon, in which he attacked Gillespie's overture of 1721. Dickinson's response identified him with the cause of British nonsubscriptionists; of individual conscience as opposed to the imposition of human creeds and dogmas; and of the primacy of Scripture in relation to unscriptural doctrines, especially of an exclusionary nature.29 Dickinson attacked both the practical and theoretical implications of ministerial subscription to the Westminster Confession. He argued that the creation of any rules for doctrine, worship or discipline that go beyond those provided by Scripture, which in themselves constitute a perfect pattern provided by God, constitutes "a bold invasion of Christ's royal power" and "a rude reflection upon his wisdom and faithfulness." No matter how artfully such rules are "painted over, with the fair colors of apostolic tradition,antiquity, order and decency ... or greater good of the church," he warned, it may be justly asked, "who has required this at your hands." Further, Dickinson recalled that such human inventions had been a leading factor in the division of Christianity and the loss of "the true word of Christ," by which "the weak are wounded, infidelity strengthened, and religion itself ... a subject of debate, instead of a rule of faith and life."30 Dickinson did not quarrel with the power of the synod to discipline "inconsistent" ministers. He had, in fact, participated in such actions. Neither did he deny that the ministers of Christ had been commissioned to interpret God's laws. Even the ministers of Christ, however, cannot claim infallibility in their interpretations, he insisted. They do not have the authority to impose their interpretations on others, and no man can be obliged to receive them "any further than appear to him just and true," or any further than his conscience might allow.31 Dickinson argued that the Synod of Philadelphia could claim the right to censure its members only in cases of scandal and instances of heresy. Disciplining the scandalous involves no violation of conscience, he explained, and though the synod has no right to impose its opinions on others, it does have an undisputed right to reject those of others. Subscription, he maintained, would fit neither purpose. It would only succeed in eliminating the conscientious and strengthening the hypocritical. The conscientious would feel called upon to "scruple," if they disagreed with any portion of the required creed, while hypocrites would agree to it no matter what their personal feelings, and thereby gain synodical sanction for their future disruptive actions.32 Dickinson concluded his comments by agreeing that it might be useful to adopt a plain and comprehensive creed or confession of faith, by which they might be able to distinguish those who accept, from those who reject, "the faith once delivered to the saints." It might even be necessary, since "the worst of heresies may take shelter under the express words of Scripture." Such creeds or confessions should not be forced on those of differing sentiments, however, he warned, as the church must take pains not to exclude from its communion, any such dissenters as it can "charitably hope Christ won't shut out of heaven." Therefore, they should "open the doors of the Church as wide as Christ opens the gates of Heaven; and receive one another, as Christ also receives us, to the glory of God."33 On September 27th, Dickinson and his protesting brethren presented four articles representing their sentiments on Gillespie's overture to the Synod of Philadelphia. The synod approved the articles, at which point Dickinson and his group withdrew their protest. The articles stated that Presbyteries and synods exercise full executive power of church government, including church discipline; that the "mere circumstances" of church discipline, such as the time, place, and "mode of carrying on in the government of the Church," belong to those same judicatories, provided the acts which result are not imposed on any who conscientiously dissent from them; that synods could compose directories addressing all aspects of discipline and recommend them to their members, provided all subordinate judicatories, including presbyteries, could decline when conscientiously opposed; and that appeals could be made on such matters from all inferior to superior judicatories, who had the power to hear them. The minutes record that the synod was so pleased with this solution that it "unanimously joined together in a thanksgiving prayer and joyful singing [of] the one hundred and thirty-third psalm ('The Benefits of Brotherly Concord')," and there the matter rested for the next five years.34 IN 1727, JOHN THOMSON OF LEWES, DELAWARE, a member of the New Castle Presbytery, to which George Gillespie belonged, once again proposed to the Synod of Philadelphia that ministers be required to subscribe to the Westminster Confession. Debate on the overture was postponed until the Synod of 1728, whereupon Thomson explained that he had proposed subscription as "an expedient for preventing the ingress and spreading errors among ourselves or the flocks committed to our care." Thomson argued that it is the duty of every Christian and each minister of the gospel, organized into one "body politic" or church, "to maintain and defend the truths of the gospel against all opposition" and "to perpetuate and propagate" those truths "unto posterity, pure and uncorrupt." Moreover, it is incumbent on the Church to "fortify itself against all assaults and invasions" that may be made on gospel truths, including those made by "secret bosom enemies to the truth," who do not openly oppose the truth but seek to undermine it from within. As an organized body of Christians united by order and government, according to the "Institution of the Word," he offered, the Church is invested with sufficient authority to do this.35 In the explanation that accompanied the published text of his overture, Thomson wrote that as what he had proposed was new to the colonial Presbyterian church, it had caused some concern and was being misconstrued, especially as to its intent. He insisted that his goal was to provide a "bond of union" where none existed and by which the several parts of the Presbyterian Church in the Middle Colonies might be joined together and properly denominated one church. Scripture was not sufficient to that end, he explained, as all ministers acknowledged Scripture to be their rule without necessarily determining in what sense they understood it. There were too many divergent theories in the world and no apostles to point to the "true" ways of God, as was the case in the New Testament Church. Therefore, a common confession of faith was necessary.36 Finally, at least in part anticipating the major stumbling block to his proposal, Thomson suggested that if some could point to particulars in the Westminster Confession that they believed to be unsound, they would be heard. If they could adequately defend their objections, they would be allowed to maintain them. In all likelihood, he offered, there would be some clauses or paragraphs that upon examination would be "judged either unsound or unsafe," but, allowing for such instances, he saw no reason to refuse the standards in their entirety. The Westminster Confession and Catechisms may have been composed by men, and, therefore "short of that perfection ... Scripture justly claims," he explained, but they are, nonetheless, of divine authority, as they are "contained in the Word of God" and composed of words "agreeable to divine matter."37 Dickinson responded to Thomson, this time in writing, with Remarks Upon a Discourse. He expanded upon essentially the same points he had included in 1722. On April 7, 1729, however, Jedediah Andrews wrote once again to Benjamin Colman, this time more alarmed than he had been in 1722. He reported that the Synod of Philadelphia was about "to fall into a great difference" over the matter of subscribing to the Westminster Confession. The overture for subscription had been offered by "all the Scotch and Irish members present," he explained, and they would "certainly carry it by numbers." The New Englanders, however, he continued, were willing to adopt the Confession as that of their church, but they would not agree to making it a test of orthodoxy and a term of ministerial communion. "Some say the design of this motion [for subscription] is to spew out our countrymen, in all their disciplinary and legislative notions," Andrews concluded. He did not know how much truth there was to that, but he remained uneasy as to its outcome.38 The Synod of Philadelphia convened on September 17, 1729, and formed a committee consisting of ministers Dickinson, Thomson, Andrews, John Pierson, Thomas Craighead, Hugh Conn, James Anderson, and elder John Budd to compose a compromise upon which the contending forces could agree. Members of the committee were carefully selected so as to represent various positions. Thomson and Anderson clearly spoke in favor of subscription, while Dickinson and Andrews stood opposed. Conn and Craighead, both of Ireland, preferred the Irish Pacific Articles, and Pierson and Budd sided with them.39 The synod committee reported on the morning of September 19th. It began by noting that the synod did not claim any authority to impose its faith on the consciences of others; indeed, it professed an "abhorrence of such imposition." Members of the committee expressed their willingness to receive one another "as Christ has received us to the glory of God," and to "admit to fellowship in sacred ordinances" all those they believed Christ would "at last admit to the kingdom of heaven." Nevertheless, the committee felt obliged to take care that its faith be kept pure and uncorrupt for posterity. It, therefore, agreed that all current ministers of the synod, as well as those who might wish to be admitted in the future, ."40 The synod voted, in what was to be known as the Adopting Act, to formally adopt the Westminster Confession and Catechisms as the confession of its faith and instructed all presbyteries within its bounds not to admit any candidate for the ministry without his having declared his agreement with all the "essential and necessary articles of the confession," either by subscribing to the Confession of Faith and Catechisms, or by "a verbal declaration of his assent thereto, as such ministers and candidates shall think best." Reminiscent of the Irish Pacific Articles, the synod added that in the event that any ministerial candidate had reservations as to any of the articles of the confession or catechisms, he should "at the time of his making said declaration declare his sentiments to his presbytery or the synod." Either body could then admit him to the exercise of the ministry, if it judged his "scruple" to be concerned only with unessential and unnecessary articles in doctrine, worship or government, or not "erroneous in essential and necessary articles of faith." The Synod of Philadelphia was compelled to issue clarifications of, and to further comment on, the Adopting Act in 1730, 1733, and 1734, but it was the Adopting Act of 1729 which, the synod argued, Samuel Hemphill had violated.41 HEMPHILL'S TRIAL BEGAN ON APRIL 17, 1735, before a commission of the synod that included some twenty ministers. Both former pro- and anti-ministerial subscriptionists were represented. Jonathan Dickinson, however, for some unknown reason, though appointed to the commission was not listed as having been present. The trial lasted until Saturday, April 26th.42 Jedediah Andrews, the plaintive, presented eight articles in which he referred to specific doctrines preached by Samuel Hemphill that he found unsatisfactory. In brief, he accused Hemphill of teaching that "Christianity is nothing else but a revival or new edition of the laws and precepts of nature"; that "the sacrament of the Lord's Supper is only a means to promote a good and pious life"; that "the Doctrine of Christ's Merits and Satisfaction ... represents God as stern and inexorable, and is only for tyrants to impose and slaves to obey"; that those who preach the Doctrine of Christ's Merits and Satisfaction make it "a charm of the word of Christ in their preaching, thereby working up their hearers to enthusiasm"; and that "saving faith" is nothing more than "an assent to or persuasion of the truth of the doctrines of the gospel on rational grounds." Andrews reported that Hemphill had not preached on original sin or on "prayer or the blood or spirit of Christ"; that he had "run down ... the Protestant Doctrine of Justification by Faith" by arguing that it "concerned new converted heathens and not us"; and that he had commonly said that "reason is our rule, and was given us for a rule."43 Existing accounts of the hearing offer only a few details as to what transpired. Hemphill was free to offer anything in his defence, and he and others spoke on his behalf, but there is no record of what he or they said. A large part of the testimony came from those who had been present when Hemphill preached, but who by no means agreed on what they had heard. Some testified to having heard unsound statements, while others denied having heard any such thing. The latter, however, were dismissed by the commission as presenting "negative evidence," in that they were merely stating that they had not heard something which might well have been said without their knowledge.44 Hemphill called for the removal of two members of the commission, the Reverends John Thomson and George Gillespie. He charged them with not being proper judges, as they had already spoken out against him, but the commission refused. The commission asked Hemphill to present his sermons, as they believed he had promised, but Hemphill refused, denying ever having made such a promise and explaining that the commission was already prejudiced against him. The commission took Hemphill's refusal to be an act of bad faith and a tacit admission of guilt.45 Hemphill pleaded his case, in part, by suggesting that when he subscribed to the Westminster Confession, he had done so with the understanding that it meant subscription to its essential articles, which, he pointed out, the synod had not identified. The commission responded by noting that as per terms of the Adopting Act, Hemphill was to have stated any objections he had to that body of doctrine at the time of his subscribing, but that he had not. That the synod had not identified those articles of the confession it considered essential, reserving to itself the liberty to judge each case on its own merits, the commission added, failed to excuse Hemphill's behavior.46 On Sunday, April 20th, while the commission was in recess, Ebenezer Pemberton and Robert Cross preached to their fellow commissioners on the dangers of being led astray by perverters of the gospel. When the commission reconvened, Hemphill charged that the sermons were inflammatory and detrimental to any sense of impartiality on the part of the commission. The commission, however, ruled that the sermons were not necessarily directed against Hemphill, "for it is always the duty of ministers to warn against perversions of doctrine."47 Hemphill ultimately produced the notes to some of his sermons, whereupon the commission proceeded to compare those notes to the charges Andrews had brought against him. Hemphill protested the commission's use of his notes rather than entire sermons and its not having told him in advance what particular points it had found objectionable, but the commission persisted and found sufficient evidence to condemn him. It unanimously declared his doctrines "unsound and dangerous," as well as "contrary to the Scriptures and our excellent Confession and Catechism," and suspended him from the ministry until the entire synod could take up the matter at its next regular meeting in September.48 IN JULY 1735, BENJAMIN FRANKLIN published his observations on the trial, in which he sought to clear Hemphill's character of what he believed to be false aspersions that had been cast upon it, and "to convince the world how unjustly some men will act, when they have their own private end in view." Some Observations was so popular, a second edition was necessary by August.49 Franklin's approach, no doubt with Hemphill's assistance, has been described by Merton Christensen as an attempt, whereby, if Franklin could not portray Hemphill as orthodox, he would at least make him appear reasonable. Where the commission found that Hemphill had preached that Christianity is "only an illustration and improvement of the law of nature," Franklin responded that such a message was neither subversive of the gospel nor disagreeable to the fundamentals of the Westminster Confession of Faith. What Hemphill meant, Franklin wrote, was that Christ's design in coming into the world was to restore mankind to the state of perfection in which Adam was at first created. Christ's laws, then, are agreeable to the "original law." They have "a natural tendency to our present ease and quiet" and "carry their own reward, though there were nothing to reward our obedience or punish our disobedience in another life." Put another way, what God has created must be "agreeable to our nature, since a desire of happiness is a natural principle which all mankind are endued with."50 The commission had condemned Hemphill for denying the necessity of conversion for those that are born in the Church and who have not degenerated into "vicious practice." Franklin wrote that, when placed into context, what Hemphill had suggested was that the conversion of which Christians speak, whereby people become "new creatures," is "most visible in the first conversion of heathens to Christianity, or of wicked professors ... to the Gospel of Christ." Those brought up in a "Christian country" and with the benefit of a "virtuous education," and not having engaged in "vicious practices," experience a much more gradual conversion. They "can't so properly be called new creatures," Franklin explained, because "they were always what they are," except for the daily improvement they make in virtue. Otherwise, Franklin insisted, Christianity and Hemphill were committed to the same teaching, which was:
to make us new creatures, quite other men from what we should have been without the Gospel, to cure the corruption and depravity of human nature, and restore it to the image of the divine nature in which man was first created, and from which by transgression he fell.51In his defense of the light of nature, Hemphill did not deny the necessity of divine revelation, Franklin wrote. Neither in his emphasis on good works did he seek to undermine the doctrine of justification by faith. What Hemphill had preached against, Franklin explained, was Antinomianism -- or those who held, that Christ's merits and satisfaction will save men without their performing good works. He had spoken out against those who had taught that to believe that good works or a holy life is necessary for men to be accepted by God depreciates the sufferings of Christ, thereby leading men never to look upon God as a lawgiver, but, instead, as only a savior. This is "the most impious doctrine" ever broached, Franklin added, as it has "a natural tendency to make men act as if Christ came into the world to patronize vice, and allow men to live as they please," thereby doing "dishonor both to the father and the son."52 Melvin Buxbaum has suggested that with publication of Some Observations, Franklin was no longer, if indeed he ever was, appealing to the Synod of Philadelphia for Hemphill's reinstatement. Instead, he was bent on building resentment toward that body, the Church, and Calvinism. The synod certainly saw it that way. On September 4, 1735, a specially appointed synod commission accused Franklin of engaging in character assassination, when he should have attempted to defend Hemphill on the merits of the case. It also defended its position on ministerial subscription to the Westminster Confession. The primary author of that defense was Jonathan Dickinson, who, though he was not one of Hemphill's judges, given his role in the Subscription Controversy, no doubt felt implicated by Franklin.53 At the outset, the synod addressed Franklin's criticism of those members of the commission who, "though zealous for the confession" in the case of Samuel Hemphill, once had been more indifferent to the confession than Hemphill. It pointed out that the nature of debate concerning ministerial subscription had changed considerably since 1729. There had been a "prodigious growth of errors and infidelity," it wrote, which threatened "to undermine the great doctrines of the gospel." Those who had "a tender regard for the common interests of religion and a desire that it might be propagated to posterity pure and uncorrupted," therefore, were obliged "vigorously to appear in its defense." As it had for the past decade or more, the synod voiced its concern for violations of individual conscience and the imposition of human creeds, but it defended as well those limits established by required ministerial subscription to the Westminster Confession, provided for in the Adopting Act of 1729.54 In response to Hemphill's defense that he had declared the Westminster Confession only in its fundamental articles, as he had understood them, and that he had remained faithful to those essentials, the synod pointed out that Hemphill had declared his assent to the confession without exception, or scruple. Subsequently, however, he had delivered sermons which were not only inconsistent with the principles he had professed, but that differed from those principles "in some of the most weighty and fundamental doctrines." It mattered not, contrary to what Hemphill insisted, that the synod had not identified those articles it considered fundamental in the Westminster Confession; by the Adopting Act of 1729, it reserved to itself the right to judge each qualification raised by individuals upon the occasion of their subscribing to it.55 The commission was called to inquire into the accusations made against Samuel Hemphill. Having found those accusations to be justified, the synod explained, the commission considered itself obligated, "in fidelity to our Great master, and to the people committed to our charge," to declare those doctrines unsound and to exclude Hemphill from their ministerial communion. In its exclusion of Hemphill, the synod asserted, the commission, on behalf of the synod, had exercised a right to which it was entitled, the right of all societies to judge the qualifications of its members. Hemphill, it added, had the same right -- he could declare non-communion from the synod, if he saw reason for it.56 SOMETIME BETWEEN THE END OF HEMPHILL'S TRIAL in April and the meeting of the synod in September, a new issue arose, and the synod addressed it, if only briefly. Hemphill was charged with plagiarizing Samuel Clarke and other English Deists, and the synod used the accusation to effect, no doubt expecting that Hemphill's impropriety would undermine his cause among those who had been defending him. It noted that Hemphill had boasted of how universally his sermons were applauded, to what large audiences he preached, and how much "they were approved by people of all persuasions, for the strain of Christian charity that runs through them." The synod responded by being critical of anyone who was forced to "be the trumpeter of his own praises," but it also pointed out that if Hemphill had given credit to those from whom he had "borrowed much of what he delivered," it would have made a considerable difference in his reputation and in the "great part of that glory, which he vainly arrogate[d] to himself."57 The Synod of Philadelphia met on September 17, 1735. On September 20th, it notified Samuel Hemphill that he was to appear before the synod on the 22nd, if he had anything further to offer in his defense. On the 22nd, it received a letter from Hemphill, wherein he rejected the synod's claim of authority, and, as their dispute had already been made public, whatever he had to say would be contained in an answer then in press. Hemphill's letter concluded with a postscript reading: "I shall think you will do me a deal of honor, if you entirely excommunicate me." The synod branded the letter "disrespectful and contemptuous" and acquiesced in Hemphill's request, confirming the commission's action against him. By a unanimous vote, citing "contumacy in his errors" and his disregard of the commission's censure, the synod declared Hemphill "unqualified for any future exercise of his ministry" within its bounds.58 On September 22nd, the day on which the synod condemned him, Hemphill's promised response to the Synod of Philadelphia appeared under the title A Letter to a Friend in the Country ... Concerning the Terms of Christian and Ministerial Communion. Although subject to some debate, Hemphill was likely responsible for the substance of A Letter. Franklin, however, provided a preface. Both avoided the theological points that had been raised against Hemphill, and instead steered the discussion further in the direction of the issues of ministerial examination, subscription, and exclusion. They argued for a minister's right to personally interpret Scripture, and against forced interpretation as tending "to obscure truth and cut off further revelation." They also insisted that as long as a minister believes in Scripture, he should be allowed to preach in any communion he chooses. In sum, Hemphill and Franklin appropriated the position on freedom of conscience Dickinson had taken during the synodical debates over ministerial subscription, even citing Dickinson in the process.59 In his preface, Franklin prepared the way for Hemphill's attack on what they argued was the synod's exclusionary policy by referring to the ministers as "a smug and tyrannical clergy which denie[d] truth to itself and to others," while pretending to piety and morality. He called upon his "brethren of the laity" to unite in a determined effort to preserve "the glorious cause of Christian liberty" not only in the Church, but beyond:
Let us then to the utmost of our power endeavor to preserve and maintain truth, common sense, universal charity, and brotherly love, peace and tranquility, as recommended in the Gospel of Jesus, in this our infant and growing nation, by steadily opposing those, whose measures tend to nothing less than utterly to subvert and destroy all.60Franklin thus posed a potentially explosive secular interpretation of the freedom of conscience doctrine he and Dickinson had espoused, to varying degrees, but, for the moment, he did not pursue it. Sticking to the case at hand, he argued that the only way to promote such liberty and advance truth was to humble the repressive power of the clergy. That, he insisted, could come about only if the laity joined in asserting its "natural rights and liberties" in opposition to the "unrighteous claims" of the clergy which pretended to be "the directors of men's consciences."61 Whenever men "blindly submit" to the "impositions of priests, whether Popish, Presbyterian or Episcopal," Franklin wrote, "ignorance and error, bigotry, enthusiasm and superstition" ensue. It had happened before, Franklin continued, pointing out that "all the persecutions, cruelties, mischiefs and disturbances" that have ever occurred in the church had resulted from such usurpation of power and abuse of authority by "her lawless sons." And, it would happen again, he warned, if they suffered the clergy "to get upon our backs, and ride us, as they do their horses, where they please." Opposition to repressive clerical authority would likely lead to charges of heresy, but, rather than being a reproach, such a charge might be their "greatest glory and honor."62 FRANKLIN REASSERTED THESE PRINCIPLES in his final published defense of Samuel Hemphill, or, perhaps better put, his final public assault on the Synod of Philadelphia, in October 1735. A Defense of the Rev. Mr. Hemphill's Observations or, An Answer to the Vindication of the Reverend Commission represents the most dramatic point in Franklin's efforts on Hemphill's behalf. It offered little of anything new in substance to the discussion, but it was, as various critics would later describe it, Franklin's "most witty and urbane" contribution to the controversy. He employed a satirical "tone of burlesque and abuse" for the sake of principle without any thought of victory. Moreover, it constitutes "the most unrestrained attack on a Calvinist establishment" Franklin ever wrote, wherein rather than continue to defend Hemphill, he sought to overcome the synod's "cool and superior argument" with vituperation, and to render it contemptible and absurd by painting it an enemy to "reason, justice, and liberty." He even went so far as to suggest that the synod's position was irreconcilable with nascent American liberty. Franklin wrote:
In this free country where the understandings of men are under no civil restraint, and their liberties sound and untouched, there is nothing more easy than to show that a doctrine is false, and of ill consequence, if it readily be so, by peremptorily declaring it unsound or dangerous, without vouchsafing to show how or where, as the commission did at the beginning of this affair, and indeed have yet done no better.63The Synod of Philadelphia must have smarted to read Franklin's immoderate attack. Dickinson himself responded, first on behalf of the synod, and later on his own, though employing a pseudonym. In both cases, he resisted any temptation he might have had to respond in kind, and, instead, continued to offer what has already been described as a characteristically "cool and superior argument." Yet again he penned a carefully reasoned explanation of what he had written earlier in defense of the Adopting Act, a copy of which he attached to the publication, and of its application to Samuel Hemphill. In Remarks upon a Pamphlet, Entitled A Letter to a Friend in the Country, published in November 1735, Dickinson continued to decry any imposition on freedom of conscience in matter of religion. He hailed the "age of liberty" into which he believed the world had entered, wherein the cause of liberty had been defended "by many learned and ingenious persons" against the claims of tyranny and persecution, and wherein people, beginning to consider themselves rational creatures and free agents, were no longer likely to "put their necks under the yoke" of doctrinal imposition. At the same time, however, Dickinson warned, the age of liberty had created difficulties for the church:
As one extreme commonly begets another, there now appears greatest danger that liberty will be abased to licentiousness, and that to escape imposition we shall open a door to infidelity, and instead of charity and mutual forbearance we shall make shipwreck of the faith as well as peace of our churches by the mixed communions of those most opposite to one another in the essential and fundamental articles of their faith.Hemphill's sermons and the articles written in his defense, Dickinson offered, had had "a direct tendency to this sad effect." He too was committed to "the glorious cause of Christian liberty," but, he warned, let them (Hemphill and Franklin) "not use their liberty ... for a cloak of maliciousness."64 As he had thirteen years earlier, Dickinson argued that Presbyterians should admit to ministerial communion anyone they suppose qualified for the work, according to the instructions Christ has provided in the gospel, no matter how different they might be. To refuse entry to such individuals would be to reject those sent by Christ, to deprive Christ's people of the advantages he has provided for them, and "to tyrannize over our brethren, by rejecting their labors in Christ's vineyard." Nevertheless, as widely as those lines might be drawn, Dickinson warned, to admit others would be to "send poison into Christ's household, instead of the portion of meat which he has provided, and to prejudice instead of advancing the interest of their precious souls."65 It is true, Dickinson allowed, that Christian societies, or churches, are subject to the one lawgiver, and that no such society has the power to impose its laws, or its interpretations of Christ's laws, on others. However, he continued, every Christian society, like every Christian, is on an equal level of liberty and has an equal claim to power and authority. As God "has given no charter to any particular church, exclusive of others," each church has an equal assurance of its own orthodoxy. Thus, though all churches are equally fallible, and though their decrees do not bear the stamp of divine authority, churches are not obliged to admit to their communion anyone with whom they disagree on the essentials of their faith:
For though it be true, that I have no juster pretense than any other person, to determine what is a fundamental article of religion, and on that account to impose my opinion upon others, yet I have an undoubted right to judge for myself, and to reject those opinions which I think fundamentally erroneous, and consequently to enjoy the liberty of my conscience, by refusing communion with those that I think unqualified for it.66Dickinson concluded his Remarks with a statement by John Locke, who was well known for speaking out against persecution and compulsion of the mind. The passage,which Dickinson believed described his own position, is from Locke's Letter Concerning Toleration (1689):
This is the fundamental and immutable right of a spontaneous society, that it has power to remove any of its members, who transgress the rules of its institution. But it cannot by the accession of any new members, acquire any jurisdiction over those, that are not joined with it. And therefore peace, equity, and friendship are always mutually to be observed by particular churches in the same manner as by private persons without any pretence of superiority or jurisdiction over one another.67Remarks upon a Pamphlet was followed by a belated reaction to A Defense by one Obadiah Jenkins, entitled Remarks upon the Defense of the Rev. Mr. Hemphill's Observations: In a Letter to a Friend. Remarks upon the Defense was signed by "a gentleman in New York who has followed the controversy," but it has been attributed to Jonathan Dickinson. Dated November 24, 1735, but published in Bradford's American Weekly Mercury on January 6, 1736, nine months after Hemphill's trial, Dickinson's response added little to the debate.68 By November 1735, Hemphill had disappeared into obscurity. As Franklin preferred to put it: "He left us in search elsewhere of better fortune," but it is clear that by the time Franklin finished defending Hemphill, no denomination would have him. As for Benjamin Franklin, he would later write in his Autobiography, upon their defeat, he left Philadelphia's Presbyterian church, although for years he continued his subscription for the support of its ministers. He took a pew in Philadelphia's Anglican Christ Church, to which he became a subscriber, and where he and his wife were buried.69 THE REVEREND SAMUEL HEMPHILL WAS NOT NEARLY so important to Benjamin Franklin as the source of his censures, the facts of his dismissal, and the nature of his doctrines. Franklin's involvement in the Hemphill affair stemmed from what he considered "the overweening assumption of power" which the Presbyterian clergy assumed to condemn Hemphill, as well as the doctrines upon which he was expelled. He did not seek to disprove the charges again Hemphill -- that Hemphill had preached ideas which contradicted the Westminster Confession -- but rather to show that what Hemphill had taught was not wrong, that it was to the greater glory of God and benefit of man, and, that, therefore, he should be free to express himself regardless of how his expressions might run counter to Presbyterian doctrinal statements. Franklin continued to support Hemphill, and to vilify the opposition, even after others had abandoned him, as Merton Christensen has suggested, "not because he had any hopes of restoring Hemphill to the pulpit," but because he believed both he and Hemphill were right.70 Franklin used the occasion of the Hemphill affair to showcase his ideas on the reasonable and benevolent nature of God and to emphasize Jesus as supreme law giver rather than as the incarnate son of God. He used it as a public forum to espouse the grand design of the sufficiency of nature as a guide to man's obligations to worship God and to love one another and to promote the "commonsensical verities of natural religion," which were the reasonableness of biblical revelation, the moral life, the inherent goodness of man, the responsibility of man for his own actions, the inviolable individual conscience, and faith as predicated on reason and on a firm assertion of the mind.71 In their consideration of the commission's censure of Samuel Hemphill, both Christensen and Buxbaum have pointed to a rigged trial. In Buxbaum's words, the commission was led by "a predetermination to find the minister guilty by hook or crook" and by judges who were "little more than prosecutors." As has been shown, however, the commission's reaction is best seen in the context of those events which preceded and surrounded it -- the subscription controversy and charges of heresy and scandal among the Presbyterian clergy of the 1720s and 1730s, as well as Hemphill's "public defense." If the commission determined to get rid of Samuel Hemphill, rather than reprimand and reinstate him, as it had others guilty of similar errors, it did so as representatives of a church under siege, seeking to balance freedom of conscience and the need for order, and then only after Hemphill had left them little choice.72 As implied by the quote with which the synod concluded A Vindication, it might have been best if the commission had not responded publicly at all, and one is left to speculate as to what the synod's response might have been if Hemphill had not gone public with his defense. Once he did, however, holding the church up to public ridicule, he sealed his fate, and in the end, as Dickinson explained, both Hemphill and the church lost:
The preacher received all the return blows; and the judges, after seeing themselves, their faith, and their institutions defamed, were in the untenable position of perhaps lending credibility to the attacks by their silence, or ... losing dignity by responding.73

I feel for you, because I am in the same boat (ah!). What I did is purchased Julbo sunglasses with prescription progressives glasses. The result (for me) is outstanding.
For my first pair, I chose their Octopus glass, which is photochromic and polarised. Unfortunately, polarised glass makes most LCD screens very dark in at least one orientation.
So for my second pair, I chose their Zebra 2-to-4 photochromic - but not polarised - glasses. The frame is their racer frame ().
As I said, I am *very* happy with the end result: glasses that I can wear in all circumstances at sea.

Dear Mr. President,
On behalf of our organizations and their millions of members and activists, we thank you, the National Ocean Council, and the Interagency Ocean Policy Task Force for developing the National Ocean Policy (NOP) to ensure the protection, maintenance and restoration of the ocean, our coasts, and the Great Lakes. The NOP is both visionary and yet grounded in the decade of bipartisan work to protect our nation’s maritime heritage and ensure healthy oceans for future generations. We know our ocean is an increasingly busy place, which can put the resources we rely on for jobs, food, and recreation at risk. We thank you for your trailblazing efforts, especially in the wake of the Deepwater Horizon oil disaster, to ensure our nation balances protecting ocean ecosystems with our reliance on those very ecosystems to sustain us.
We appreciate the emphasis that the NOP places on inclusive decision-making and bringing diverse viewpoints to the table. Under the directive of the NOP, state and federal agencies, fisheries managers, Native American tribes, and coastal communities have a platform to govern our waterways in a new, transparent, and proactive way – together. Using the NOP as a catalyst for collaboration, goal setting, and decision-making, the regions of the West Coast and Pacific Islands were able to stand up Regional Planning Bodies while the Northeast and Mid-Atlantic developed the first-ever action plans to inform and guide the protection and sustainable development of our Nation’s oceans and coasts.
We are proud of the work that has been done to protect, maintain, and restore the ocean, our coasts, and the Great Lakes over the past eight years and vow to continue blazing a path of innovation and inclusion in ocean management and remain strong in our role as watch dogs and implementers of sound ocean policy.
During your time in office you were an ally to the ocean, inspired many coastal conservation groups and communities to take action, and protected more of our ocean than any other president in U.S. history, and for that, we extend our sincerest gratitude. We thank you, Sir, for your eight years of service, wish you the best in your future endeavors, and look forward to continuing your ocean legacy.
Sincerely,

When you first enter the real world, it’s easy to waste your money on meals out or a trip to the bar. As opposed to doing this, be responsible in managing your finances in order to stay out of debt.
Keep a small envelope in your wallet or purse. Put every business card or receipt you receive into this envelope. If you ever need to refer to them for future reference, you’ll know immediately where they are. Keeping your receipts helps you have proof of your purchases in the event that your credit card is incorrectly charged.
Debt should be your last resort, because debt can lead to poor personal finances. While some debt is inescapable, such as mortgages and education loans, you should work hard to avoid toxic debt like credit cards. You will lose less money to interest and possible fees if you borrow less money..
If collectors are harassing you for repayment of debts, try and do some negotiating with them. Debt collection agencies purchase the debt for a fraction of what was originally owed. As a result, they can also offer some savings to you. Contact any debt collectors you owe and see if they will accept an offer at a lower price.
You have to get out of debt before you can rebuild your credit score. The best way to get yourself out of debt is to pay down your loan and credit card debts, so you will need to cut back a little. a flexible spending account and use it. An FSA can mean serious savings if you wind up with medical bills or need to pay daycare. These types of accounts permit you to allot a specific amount of untaxed dollars for healthcare or childcare expenses. Consult a tax professional to find out what kind of expenses qualify for this account.
If there is an item that needs to be bought but is quite pricey, look to your family to help purchase the item. If the whole family can use it, they should pool their money in order to buy it.
To eliminate your debts as quickly as possible, make high interest credit card debt your top priority. Credit cards with high interest rates will cost you tons of money if you do not pay them off. Credit card rates will just rise in the future, so it’s important to get them paid off soon.
It can take more distance and effort, but you may save tons by just using ATMs that are associated with your credit union, bank, or thrift. The per-transaction fees are on the rise, as this is money that you can have in your pocket.
You may want to get overdraft protection with your bank if you are frequently struggling financially. This fee may save you from a lot bigger fees in the future.
Make an effective tax documentation system to avoid hunting for that one receipt at the last minute. Keep all your receipts and other tax documents organized in the same place throughout the year, and you will be ready when tax time rolls around.
Take the time to mull over your feelings towards money. You can’t begin to improve your situation until you fully understand the financial decisions that you’ve made. Take some time to write down your beliefs about money, and determine why you feel think the way you do. If your current feelings are less than positive, you can now release them in favor of new more productive feelings.
If you have the ability to improve your home on your own, avoid paying a professional. Do-it-yourself courses are often offered by large home supply stores and there are some incredible online video tutorials for just about anything you need to do around your house.
If you want to be more successful with your personal finances, having a written budget is the key. List all of your monthly expenses at the start of each month. Make sure you don’t leave out anything. Add expenses for gas, electricity, food, phones, Internet and your morning Starbucks runs. Be sure to note all expected expenditures. It is important to stick to the amounts designated in order to stay on track.
If you want to save a lot of money, cooking instead of buying your meals is a great idea to try. Cooking a healthy meal at home for your family will cost less than $30. You can spend more than that on two pizzas with a two-liter soda these days.
Be aggressive about re-working your insurance policies as a way to cut down your monthly payments. You can check with your insurance company about different options, such as bundling and eliminating unnecessary coverage. This will save you a ton of money over time.
Don’t become overwhelmed by debt. Avoid having unpaid bills and create a shopping list that fits within a good budget to help improve your monthly expenditures. Use these tips to avoid any of your accounts going into collections.90 members78 Comments 7 Likes

Hello Michel:
Thank you for adding me & welcome to my page.

MaryanneFor thousands of years, pearl gemstone jewellery has been associated with high society and the upper class. According to myth and legend, Cleopatra is thought to have crushed a pearl into a glass of wine for Marc Antony, just so she could provide him with the most expensive dinner in history. In this article we explore the history of the beautiful, naturally formed precious stone, and begin to look into a few of the reasons why pearl jewellery has always been associated with such exquisite taste and high social standing.
Thousands of years ago, the first pearl was discovered; thought to be accidentally stumbled across on the seashore, by humans, while they were searching for food. Still known today as being one of the most expensive, and sought after gems, the pearl is yearned after for its inner shine, and dazzling iridescent quality. Throughout history, countless references have been made to the pearl, able to be sourced in religious contexts from thousands of years, previous. Seeing pearls as the ultimate symbol of wealth, the ancient Egyptians loved the natural stone so much, that they chose to be buried with them.
Looked to as a symbol of social standing, people of ancient Greece held the pearl in high regard due to not only its indescribable beauty but also for its association with romance and commitment. Even during the Dark Ages, pearls still had their place, with knights often choosing to wear them into battle, believing that the magical gemstones would protect them from harm. During the Renaissance, a number of countries in Europe actually ended up passing a law that disallowed anyone but nobility to wear the precious stones.
When pearls were discovered in Central American waters, during the expansion into the New World, a source of wealth was instantly added to Europe. Unfortunately though, not long after this, virtually all American pearl oysters diminished, due to the sheer greed of divers hunting for the beautiful gems. From this point onwards, until the start of the 1900’s, the pearl population was so low, that the natural stones were only available to the rich and famous, making them even more valuable and sought after than ever before.
Unlike most natural gemstones, that form from a chemical reaction deep inside the earth, pearls are the product of a living organism, known today as an oyster. Living far below the surface of the ocean, oysters produce a pearl when a foreign object such as a parasite, or a piece of shell, accidentally lodges itself inside of the oyster’s body. Unable to expel the object, the oyster’s body then goes into defensive action, beginning to create a smooth, hard substance around the foreign object, in the hope of protecting themselves from harm. Referred to today as “nacre”, the smooth, crystalline substance forms on the irritant, layer-upon-layer, for as long as it remains inside of the oyster’s body. Once the irritant is completed covered in the silky, smooth layers, the beautiful gem we know today as a pearl, is born.
So what is it that makes Pearl jewellery so appealing to high society? Below we discuss just a couple of reasons why the natural forming gems are considered today, and throughout history, as exquisite pieces of jewellery, solely for the upper class.
Expensive Price – The expensive price of a naturally formed pearl, is something that only the rich can afford. The high-end jewellery created with the now, ever rare natural gemstones, are deemed to be totally unaffordable for the lower class, giving the proud wearer of the expensive, pearl gemstone jewellery, high social standing.
Link with purity – By the Middle Ages, Christians had started to consider pearls as sacred objects, due to the association they have with religious purity. The pearls covering the Holy Grail were reported by early Christians, to make the water pure.
Resembling Royalty – It is no secret that for many years, pearl jewellery has been seen as somewhat of a luxury purchase, most associated with Royalty. As touched on earlier in the article, during the Renaissance, a new law was passed that meant everybody was forbidden to wear pearl jewellery, aside from nobility. This in itself is probably one of the many reasons today, that high society has such a love for pearl jewellery, as there was a time when only the most important people in the world were legally allowed to own it. Today, you can see Kate Middleton, the Duchess of Cambridge, elegantly pulling off a beautiful pair of pearl earrings or American Icon, Lady Michelle Obama sporting a full, double strand pearl necklace. Traditionally viewed as old fashioned accessories to jewellery collections, pearls are now, definitely on their way back in, with some of the most influential celebrities such as Angelina Jolie, Keira Knightley and Katy Perry, all introducing pearls into their modern outfit choices.
Religious and mythological references – The pearl made its first appearance in religious contexts when it was claimed in Christian accounts that Adam and Eve wept, soon after they were diminished from Paradise. This was thought to create a lake of pearls, white gemstones formed from the female tears of Eve, and darker, black pearls formed from Adam. When asked to explain the rarity of the black pearl today, in comparison to the white, it is said that men have more control over their emotions than women do, so Adam consequently shed fewer tears than Eve.
No two pearls are exactly alike – In high society today, pearl and diamond jewellery is seen as being the most popular. One advantage of a pearl over its diamond competitor is that the natural formed method of the stone, means no two pearls are created the same, while handcrafted diamonds can be identically faceted.
Natural Perfection – Thinking, again, about the particular appeal of pearls over beautiful diamonds; although both gemstones are formed naturally, pearls come straight out of an oyster naturally polished to perfection by the sea. Diamonds, on the other hand, need to be cut, cleaned and polished before they can even begin to be used.
With the outstanding amount of references to pearls, and their use in high society, made throughout history, it truly cannot be argued that pearl jewellery continues to be seen today as a symbol of wealth, importance, and high social standing. With its religious references to purity, and it’s perfect, natural perfection, it’s really no surprise that the beautiful gemstone jewellery is so highly sought after.Have you mastered the Google Analytics Exam?

...to see something that would change my life forever. It was something I had been concerned about since I was member of the Mississippi Legislature and the reality of the situation was there before my eyes.
The night before I did not get much sleep. The winds were howling so, banging on my door like a group of invaders trying to break in my apartment. Thunder roared, lightning flashed, rain poured down. All I could do was pray myself to sleep and hope the roof would not cave in or the door and windows would shatter under this brutal attack.
By the grace of God, I did sleep and then awoke. I turned on the television and there it was in my face: total devastation. Hotels where I had once stayed in where gone. Casinos where I had dined in where gone. Homes of friends (and enemies) were gone or severely damaged. My worst fear had come true and all I could think about was getting on my computer and start tracking down friends, not fully understanding that many of them would not respond until days later.
I was living in Clinton, some 200 plus miles from where Hurricane Katrina made a direct hit on Mississippi the morning of August 29, 2005. My car was in the shop being repaired, so I had no transportation to leave, but I did not worry because I figured the storm would weaken as it came north. It did, but not enough. When I stepped out on the balcony of my apartment four years ago, I saw trees down, I saw smoke billowing from afar, I heard sirens constantly. Fortunately my cellphone was charged and I could tell my parents I was alright. I could check on my son and ex-wife to see if they were alright. At least there was peace in that.
Then I went back to the TV and became instantly angry. For years I had been warning my legislative colleagues about this day. I had been pushing for legislation to put more money into our Mississippi Emergency Management Fund for I knew a day like this would eventually come. I expressed great concern when I would visit the Mississippi Gulf Coast and see these tremendous skyscrapers being built near the beach, wondering what the impact would be to those structures and the people that lived in them. Now I was watching my worst fears come true and hearing the past voices of my colleagues saying, "Fleming you worry too much."
In the days that followed I got my land line phone up and made even more contact with folks I had concerns about, I walked to the police station and loaded trailers and I went to the church that had been designated a Red Cross shelter and spoke with the people who had made it north out of the brunt of the storm in time. I located family members for them, got some employment and housing here for them and just listened when they laughed or cried.
Then as friends were checking in on the Internet, they would ask how bad is it. I told them what they were seeing on television was real, it was that bad. It took me a month before I could go down to the coast myself and it was a surreal experience. I told one of the volunteers it was if the "War of the Worlds" had actually happened. An area that was once a city park was now looking like a field military compound, tents everywhere. I nearly threw out my back moving water-logged furniture out of houses. I had already been frustrated that we went into Special Session and all we could accomplish was allowing the casinos to move 800 feet inland. Now as I saw neighborhoods destroyed, I could only get more infuriated with the process.
It was an epiphany, a wake-up call for me. I have never been comfortable with the status quo since. I don't settle for "that is the way we always do it" anymore. People matter to me more. Doing the best you can is the only option. Living without some things doesn't phase me. God is truly the center of my life and pleasing Him is way more important than pleasing mankind.
My life journey has been a roller coaster since that morning four years ago, but I am thankful every day that I am still riding that roller coaster of life. I know from that experience that no matter how far you fall, how much devastation occurs in your life, God can help you pick up the pieces and He can fortify and renew your soul. I have nothing to fear for He is on my side.
I am fully awoke.

During my short visit to Singapore, we were able to squeeze in a visit to Mrs. M's favourite wonton noodle restaurant on the last morning of my trip. We arrived just before 11am to beat the queue and we got there just in the nick of time! We were one of the first people waiting for them to open! When we were seated and I saw their very minimal menu, I realised that they literally only served noodles and wonton!
Everything we ordered was delicious! The noodles were the perfect firm but soft texture and I loved how thin the noodles were. The barbecue pork on top was also very tasty. The wontons were small, but tasted amazing. The boiled wontons were perfect eaten together with the noodles and the fried wontons were perfect as a side dish and dipped into their tasty mayonnaise.
If you're a big noodle aficionado, or just looking a delicious cheap meal in Singapore, then Eng's Noodle House is the place for you!

From XBRLWiki
CEN WS XBRL Experts: Thierry Declerck (DFKI), Roland Hommes (Rhocon), Katrin Heinze (Deutsche Bundesbank)
- Foreword
This document has been prepared by CEN/WS XBRL, under the supervision of the Secretariat of the Netherlands Standardization Institute (NEN).
- Part 3: European XBRL Taxonomy Architecture
This document is currently submitted for a public consultation.
- Introduction
- General
The purpose of this document is to present and explain the European XBRL Taxonomy Architecture (EXTA) defined by European supervisory authorities. In particular, it explains the scope (coverage of information requirements), the modularization of files, the a formal language, can fill this gap. XBRL, as a data format, is standardized and can therefore be used to enable automated processes. XBRL taxonomies are metadata specifications that provide a formal description of the data requirements to be used as data format in the European reporting process. The document also intends to provide a description for IT experts about the linkage between a DPM, as a source, and the XBRL taxonomy, as a target, of a transformation process.
These pages are an introduction to the guidelines of the of the European Banking Authority (EBA) and the European Insurance and Occupational Pensions Authority (EIOPA) for the electronic data exchange between the national competent authorities (NCA) and the European supervisory authorities (ESA);
- Taxonomy Architecture: This architecture has been created to limit the wide variety of options to define an XBRL taxonomy because different European XBRL taxonomies for similar purposes may cause incompatibility and would lead to increased implementation costs for all adopters in the EU market.
- Objective
The objective of the EXTA is to define a set of architecture guidelines that transform a European DPM without a loss in quality of the XBRL format. The taxonomy architecture provides a set of rules for this transformation in order to enable the creation of consistent and predictable XBRL metadata definitions in an automated process. The EXTA supports a modular structure to enable the extensibility of these taxonomies, as well as to facilitate their maintenance. As the EXTA is a formal representation of a DPM, it contains several structural concepts which have no correspondence to other known XBRL architectures.
- Target audience
The EXTA is targeted at taxonomy authors: Initially, for organizations like EBA, EIOPA, European Securities and Markets Authority (ESMA), European Central Bank (ECB) etc. As a spin-off of these taxonomies, local (national) initiatives will emerge, hosted by National Supervisory Agencies (NSA's). To accommodate the demands of local legislation, the European taxonomies may need to be extended for local requirements. The EXTA is also aimed at supporting these national extensions in accordance with the same guiding principles. The main advantage is to have a consistent framework of XBRL taxonomies, which enables a cost efficient implementation of software solutions.
Consistent taxonomies throughout Europe also create the opportunity for cross-EU harmonization of terminology and, at a later stage, consistent reported facts that are more easily analyzed because the underlying structure is the same and the terms used are complementary.
A consequence of a consistent taxonomy framework is that software developers can choose to support only the architectural guidelines of EXTA. Although this limits their software in supporting fully fledged XBRL taxonomies, it can improve implementation costs.
This document is aimed at the users of European supervisory taxonomies, in particular, editors of the taxonomy or producers of instance documents (by applying mappings to internal systems or assigning XBRL tags with values), as well as developers of the IT solutions that facilitate reporting in the XBRL format or the analysis of XBRL data [Bund13, p.3].
- Relationship to other work
The reader of this EXTA is expected to be familiar with the principles of data modeling, and have a thorough understanding of the XBRL family of specifications, in order the structures of data describing the characteristics of the information exchanged, as it relates to supervisory reporting processes.
- 2.3
- Dimension
- A Dimension is a data set refer to represents the nature of the data with a fixed and unchangeable meaning.
- Note 1 to entry: Metrics are strongly related to the underlying data type. Mostly they are numeric and quantitatively measurable, but they can also be reflect boolean or date values. A metric also known in XBRL terms as "primary" itema three levels:
- cross sector concepts and breakdowns (to be shared between different institutions e.g., banking, insurance and securities supervision),
- concepts from information requirements of for example economy sectors, classes of financial instruments, accounting portfolios, time intervals, etc. This task will most likely be conducted by the reconciliation of dictionaries which have business concepts defined by the EBA, EIOPA and other interested parties. Cross sector concepts will be published on the Eurofiling activities at the European level. They may refer to and extend the level one (cross-sector) concepts.
Level three are the concepts of national supervisors. They reflect information requirements set by a national legislation and specific supervisory regulations.
The idea of levels for concept definitions has been addressed in the XBRL taxonomy model by introducing the notion of the owner. The owner represents an institution that defines the (e.g., "").
The prefix {opre} is used as the basis to establish namespace prefixes in taxonomy files and for some short representations of the concepts by QNames using shorter prefixes (instead of long namespaces) plus the local name (e.g., "eba"). (e.g., ""):
- representation of the geographical area covered by the institution (e.g., eu in case of the cross sector or the EBA concepts, or es for the national specific concepts applied in Spain),
- indication of the scope of information requirement (e.g., fr for general financial reporting)
- fixed xbrl component identifying the type of standard used to express information requirements.
Additional parts are possible based on the proprietary needs of a regulator.
- by, relative to which templates/forms are included in the filing and, for example, shall be displayed to users;
- trigger execution of business rules (value assertions) to be run on a filing in order to check its correctness, depending on the reported scope of data [Bund13, p. 9].
In technical terms, filing indicators are facts included as part of an instance document where the filer states C_03.00 and C_22.00:
<find:fIndicators> <find:fIndicator contextRef=”ctx”>C_03.00</find:fIndicator> <find:fIndicator contextRef=”ctx”>C_22.00</find:fIndicator> </find:fIndicators>
Context to which facts representing find:fIndicator element refer must identify the reporting entity and use the instant date which is the reference date of the reporting.
Table codes to be used on find:fIndicator:fIndicator:

Dictionary of concepts
The core concepts of the dictionary are metrics, dimensions, domains and domain members. Secondary concepts are families and perspectives (auxiliary concepts meant to group dimensions for presentation purposes). All the concepts in the dictionary are public elements.

Sinceizing the underlying XBRL structure. To express the model transformation, the UML source model of the DPM and the UML target model for representing the XBRL structure are given. Between the two graphs, an abstract transformation syntax is used to describe the transformation rules from the source to the target model. The graph transformation intends to facilitate of what is being mapped. We distinguish eleven,
- C2R - transformation from UML class in the DPM meta-model to a XBRL resource as part of an XBRL linkbase,
- a Relationship to an UML class representing, depicted in Figure 1, transformations are used to show how the DPM objects of the meta-model are mapped to XBRL objects. By providing a more abstract view these graphs should facilitate the understanding of the correlation between DPM and EXTA.

The graph transformation, depicted in Figure 4, is related to a specific business point of view, and also has its correspondence in a taxonomy based on the EXTA.

- Table 11 — Examples of perspectives:
- Table 12 — Examples of domain items, depicted in Figure 5, visualizes how explicit domains which are defined in a DPM are mapped to the EXTA taxonomy structure. A DPM to be generated in an EXTA taxonomy needs to follow specific rules which are summarized in the DPM Meta- model (chapter 6.6.3). One of these rules defines.

- Figure 6 — Mapping between presentation relationships in DPMs to hierarchies defined in presentation linkbases in XBRL
In reference an EXTA taxonomy. Primary items and domain members are built in separate parent-child relationships. There will be no mixing of primary items and domain members in the same presentation relationship. The given order defined in the DPM will be transferred to the taxonomy by using transformed into a domain-member relationship, included in a definition linkbase. The EXTA defines that the parent of this relationship is a domain and the child is a member. The concept representing a domain builds a dimension-domain relationship, with the dimension as the parent and the domain as the child. In general, XBRL allows linking a member directly to an explicit dimension and to define nested structures between members by using the order attribute. The EXTA limits this freedom by the constraint that an EXTA specific domain element is to be created to reference all defined members, with no specific relevance to the order of the members in a domain (Figure 8).

- Figure 8 — Graph transformation of rule relationships into custom calculation relationships stored in calculation linkbases in XBRL
The arithmetical relationship between members the basis of the DPM definitions are summarized in the calculation linkbase. The calculation linkbase serves as a container. The defined structures are used to define assertions according to XBRL Formula 1.0 specification.
These calculation arcs include a weight attribute to indicate whether the child member contributes to the aggregation positively (+1) or negatively (-1). The that is associated with the owner.
Domain members that extend the domain of another owner are placed in a folder preceded by the prefix of the extended owner.

Because an EXTA taxonomy is a representation of a DPM in a formal language, the taxonomy holds all information defined. A DPM can be defined for more than one framework and can hold information for different taxonomy versions. All this meta information, apart from the elements that are defined to determine the content of an XBRL instance, needs to be specified in XBRL. The EXTA specifies abstract concepts to represent the DPM structure. They are just structural elements, where the attributes periodType as well as nillable, have no meaning. As they are concepts of XBRL item type, they can be linked to resources like labels or documentation. the value of its id attribute is constructed according to the general pattern ({opre}_{taxonomy code}). General taxonomy properties are presented in the table below.

To facilitate the specification of additional taxonomy resources in this document, in the following statements apply:
-  the specialization of a public element, is transformed to a concept of custom type taxonomy. The attributes defined in the meta-class Taxonomy do not have a direct correspondence the taxonomy includes three subfolders for:

- Figure 12 — Graph transformation from DPM to XBRL for table groups
Table groups are used to link numerous tables defined by one template, or resulting from the normalization of templates, or if an original template is composed of two or more physical tables.
The files that define the content of each table are placed in a folder whose name corresponds to the code of the table in the model ({table code}). General properties of a table are presented below:
- Table 23 — General properties of a table
Schema file for a table.
- more complex labels. The resources include XML elements that refer to dictionary concepts. Whereas filter axes include only typed dimensions in EXTA, the rule axes can hold primary items as well as dimension member combinations. Due to the complexity of the model, the header label included in the presentation perspective of the DPM meta-model is not reflected in this model. The same applies to the table cell which is formed by the combination of the defined axes and their corresponding resources:
- Table 25 — Examples of time references
The definition linkbase includes dimensional relationships valid in the context of the table. Valid combinations are defined using only positive (all) closed hypercubes obtained from the set of valid cells of the table, following certain algorithms in order to optimize their number.
Each extended link role contains one or more primary items and a single hypercube. The model schema includes a hypercube element to be used. There is no need to define hypercube elements in each table or taxonomy. In, the header taxonomy and filing indicators. General properties of a module are presented below:
- Table 26 — Properties of modules
[Source: EBA12, p. 19]
The meta-class Module of a DPM is mapped to an abstract concept of to which they are to be applied. In the context of a table, not reported or nil numeric values will be assumed to be zero; consequently, fallback values shall be used in their corresponding assertion definitions. The link between an assertion set and the table (or tables) to which it applies, is represented using applies-to-table arcs from the assertion set to the resource that corresponds to the table. The URI of this arc is as follows:
If an assertion applies to multiple tables individually or to multiple sets of tables, then it will be associated with different assertion sets.
- Table 27 — Examples of assertions, assertion sets and tables they apply to
Assertion sets resources might include the attributes model:fromDate and model:toDate to constrain that processes a certain filing would configure the processor to skip all those assertion sets that are linked to a table that is not reported.
However, at the time of writing of this document, the XBRL specifications do not provide a standard API to pass this information to XBRL processors, nor with a precondition of filing indicators. Assertions might have additional preconditions,:fIndicator[@find:filed=true() or not(@find:filed)] = ‘{table-code}’" as="xs:boolean" …/>
Each precondition is composed as a sequence of or expressions that correspond to each set of tables where the validation is to be applied. Each: Formula always be reported. The variable uses aspect cover filters to avoid any interference with the rest of variables. This variable is defined once as a sequence variable that matches the filing indicators.

City Manager Joseph Nicholson Jr. has promised that there are more proposals to come, including a possible admission tax to area attractions. Any tax increase would need legislative approval.
“It’s getting the support for revenue initiatives that the City Council comes up with that we don’t have our own autonomy to act,” said Nicholson.
“We’re looking at making pretty bold moves in the city that allow us to be successful in the long run,” said Mayor Jamie Bova, particularly focusing on education and the economy. “We have to be able to show we are committed to the schools, and that takes time and money.”
But local proposals are certainly not without controversy. While the city is asking for a 1 percent increase in lodging and restaurant taxes, so is the governor in her proposed budget. While the city specifically wants the funds used for local infrastructure improvements, such as schools, the governor wants the money for the beleaguered general fund.
The city has made this request to legislators in the past, but this year’s proposal differs because it would include all communities and specifically focus on local infrastructure improvements.
At their February 27th regular Council Meeting, Newport City Council voted 6-0 to approve – a Request to Legislative Delegation to Introduce Legislation to the RI General Assembly to amend RIGL 44-18-36.1 “Hotel Tax” and 5 -1 to approve ( Councilor Leonard opposed) Request to Legislative Delegation to Introduce Legislation to the RI General Assembly to amend RIGL 44-18-18.1, “Local Meals and Beverage Tax”. Councilor McLaughlin was absent from the meeting.
While Evan Smith, Discover Newport’s Executive Director, agrees with the city’s revenue needs, he’s concerned that statewide and locally, the focus is solely on increasing taxes or fees for lodging and meals.
“I’m supporting 100 percent the city’s needs to get revenue,” Smith said. But, he said, it’s about fairness. “The travel industry produces a lot of revenue…(we) need a fair and equitable balance. Keep an eye on the dashboard, try to keep it equal.”
While tourism taxes have focused on lodging and restaurants, Smith said there are segments of the industry that are not taxed. Among those, he said, are attractions, tours, ferries, recreation, and events.
“As part of this overall discussion the state and the city need to decide whether there shouldn’t be other people so there’s a level playing field, so that everybody is paying their fair share versus too high a burden on certain sectors of the industry that pay too high a tax,” Smith said.
“The dashboard for taxes and fees should rise at a relatively even pace for all segments,” Smith said. “Looking only to increase lodging and meals taxes without taxing other segments is a sensitive issue among industry partners.”
For the city, and likely cities and towns across Rhode Island, the issue is about the revenues.
While 1 percent for hotels and restaurants may not sound substantial, Smith said it would generate an additional $3 million in revenue.
The lodging tax in Rhode Island is 6 per cent, and the meals tax is 1 percent. That’s on top of the 7 per cent sales tax. Smith said the 13 percent lodging tax (sales tax, plus lodging tax) is 1 percent below the national average.
The bottom line is revenue, and while city officials are sympathetic to state needs, they believe there’s a critical need to take care of city needs.
“We’re just trying to figure out the paradigm, the financial paradigm,” Nicholson said.
Looming in the background is the Rhode Island Department of Education (RIDE) study that showed it would take more than $2.2 billion to bring Rhode Island’s schools to an acceptable level, and more than $600 million to make schools throughout the state safe.
The result was passage last fall of a $250 million bond to help cities and towns pay for the school improvements. That money is supposed to provide cities and towns with from 35 percent to 55 percent reimbursement, depending upon several factors. That money likely won’t go far. In Westerly, for instance, they’re talking about a possible bond issue of upwards of $70 million, and when debt serve is included that rises by another $40 million plus. In Newport, Nicholson said, they’ve used for illustration a figure of $100 million, plus debt service of at least $50 million.
Schools across the state were found to be in disrepair as a result of a failure to provide regular maintenance, much the same issue that has made the state’s bridges and roads among the worst nationally.
“The enemy of government is deferred maintenance when it comes down to it,” Nicholson said “But then again, it’s difficult with the resources you have to concentrate these resources on other things. The answer is to do a better job in maintenance.”
For Bova and Nicholson the city is at a crossroads, not only because of the condition of schools, primarily Rogers High School, which the state report identified as among the schools in worst condition, but also because of major economic development projects that are either underway or will be soon.
“I do believe in Newport, we’re at an infrastructure crossroads,” Bova said. “The infrastructure is so important to our economy you can’t ignore it. You can’t ignore the condition of Rogers High School. You can’t ignore the other things that go along with it.
“…The reality today is there are real issues that we can really define well in which the government needs the money, the residents need the money to support these initiatives.”Tag - Mercedes Benz airbag resetter

Is there a real-life basis for Luke?
Yes, there is. In fact, over here in Britain, we’ve had two such people. The first did exactly what Luke did. He broke into the American NSA databases, one of the most secretive and impenetrable databases in the world. The Americans were seriously worried about the damage this kid had done and wanted him extradited. Prime Minister Theresa May, who at the time was home secretary, saved him. She didn’t extradite due to his fragile mental state, as she didn’t think he’d survive in a Supermax prison, which is where he was destined to go.
Do you think intelligence professionals pick up ideas from novels and use them in their work?
Apparently they do, even if they say they wouldn’t rely on fiction. Once, during the Cold War, I was interviewing a high-ranking defector from the KGB. I introduced myself, and he said he knew who I was and that I was very popular. I thought I was banned in the USSR, and he said I was to the people but not the KGB, and that every time one of my books came out they had a limousine from the embassy outside a bookshop in London to pick up 50 copies. After their shipment in a diplomatic bag to the Russian equivalent of Langley, there would be two to three days of silence, as all the generals were busy reading.
In your 2015 memoir, My Life in Intrigue, you said you wrote The Day of the Jackal in 35 days. Do you still write at that speed?
No. I was 31 then, and I’m now 80. Jackal was all prepared in my head, as I had lived through being a foreign correspondent in Paris in 1962–1963. The OAS was on the threshold of assassinating the president of France. Even at the time, I didn’t think they would succeed unless they hired a real pro with a sniper rifle. Seven years later, I went back to that thought. I didn’t do any preparation and wrote off the top of my head, producing 10 pages per day over 35 days, which became a novel. The only thing I researched was how to forge a British passport.
You once announced you were retiring, then you changed your mind. Is this the last book you’ll write?
This really is the last! I wrote this the same year I moved houses, which is traumatic enough, and the tight deadline nearly knocked me sideways. I was writing frenziedly fast from March to May. Age has certain privileges, and one is that you’re allowed to slow down.Taught by Daniel Walkowitz, this N.Y.U. course, entitled New York City: A Social History, covers the following ground:

01332 521270Known as the tree of life, coconuts are a nourishing and versatile gift of nature, and play an essential role in Balinese rituals, cuisine and well being. Inspired by the soul of nature, Amarterra Spa, Nusa Dua incorporates coconut into every aspect of a divine spa ritual.
You certainly don’t need to look far to find a coconut in Bali. They dangle from leafy palm trees, are sold by roadside vendors as a refreshing drink, form the creamy sweet base of aromatic curries, while the fresh leaves of coconut palms are used to weave Hindu offerings.
The Dharma Rejuvenation treatment at Amarterra Spa offers a celebration of the coconut that will leave you glowing from the inside out. Set in the tranquil surrounds of Amarterrra Villa, Nusa Dua – a luxury resort that embodies the spirit of ancient Balinese culture – the spa is a serene oasis adopting the Hindu/Buddhist philosophy of Dharma as a key to achieving a better way of life. Soothing treatments include traditional Balinese wellness practices through the power of living plants, water, precious stones and inner strength.
My spa ritual begins as I sip from a fresh young coconut. Packed with nutrients and electrolytes, this is the ultimate hydrator, and I feel it nourishing every cell of my body. Next I receive a Hindu blessing and sprinkle of holy water from a virgin coconut, followed by a cleansing foot ritual with scrub of Balinese sea salt and lime and a cool splash of coconut water. A scrub made from the grated flesh of a coconut is then applied to my body. Ideal for sensitive skin, it is gentle and mildly exfoliative and left to dry on my skin before being gently scrubbed off. The virgin coconut oil massage that follows is deeply relaxing, and aromatic, imbued with essential oils of lemon, lavender and ylang ylang. The coconut oil glides smoothly over my skin, a pure tonic of vitamin E and antioxidants, that soothes, conditions and seals in moisture.
Hot towels remove the excess oil and a creamy coconut lotion is applied to my body. Another Balinese blessing is bestowed upon me, and a comforting warm rosella and ginger tea completes the treatment.
The verdict
Massage is revitalising as it stimulates blood circulation below the skin and in the muscles which brings more oxygen to tissues, and when combined with a rich nourishing oil such as coconut, the effects are increased significantly. While the treatment itself was deeply relaxing, I emerge thoroughly rejuvenated, and my skin feels wonderfully silky. I am then advised to pick a lucky stone from one of eight pots, and it comes as no surpise that the stone I have chosen bears the words ‘transformation.’

Purpose: :
To describe the histopathology of deep anterior lamellar keratoplasty (DALK) using the "big-bubble" technique.
Methods: :
Deep stromal buttons from two keratoconus patients who had undergone DALK surgery using the "big-bubble" technique were examined by light microscopy. Surgical and clinical history of these patients were also reviewed.
Results: :
In both cases, histopathology showed diffuse intrastromal spaces consistent with air bubbles. The apical stromal thinning that characterizes keratoconus was not readily appreciated.
Conclusions: :
To our knowledge, this is the first report on the histopathology of DALK specimens using the "big bubble" technique. Because the corneal emphysema induced by the procedure can mask typical histologic findings of keratoconus, such as apical stromal thinning, it is important to specify the surgical technique used and make the pathologist aware of this iatrogenic effect.

With the possibility of more snow coming our way don't leave your car parked on the wrong side of the street; you'll be fined. According to KWQC TV, the city of Davenport ticketed and towed 78 vehicles in violation of the city’s second snow emergency Monday night.
The KWQC TV story says, according to the city’s Public Works Director, Nicole Gleason, the vehicles were left parked on streets throughout downtown as crews worked to clear the snow piles left behind from last weekend’s snow storm.
During a second snow emergency, issued specifically for downtown and parts of the Hilltop neighborhood, cars must be moved from city streets before work begins at 10 p.m. on the night of the emergency.
Vehicles left on the road are given a $35 ticket from the city, in addition to the vehicle being towed. Fees are generally around $230, according to the KWQC story.
The city issued its first notice of the snow emergency “36 or more hours in advance” of the emergency. City code does not say how much notice must be given ahead of a snow emergency, however; it does state the only notification requirement is “proper notice of the emergency and the terms and conditions thereof” be listed on the city’s website.
Gleason said texts messages are sent to those impacted and who have signed up through the city’s notification system and blue snow emergency lights were also turned on throughout the downtown area “as a courtesy.”
According to Gleason, 400 vehicles were ticketed during snow emergencies issued from the snow storm at the end of November. It is unclear how many of those were also vehicles that were towed.Kerry Kennedy, the ex-wife of Gov. Andrew Cuomo and daughter of Sen. Robert F. Kennedy, slept in a locked bathroom to protect herself from him, according to the New York Post, citing Michael Shnayerson, who wrote a biography on Cuomo.
The claims come as more and more allegations have been presented claiming that Cuomo has been bullying and inappropriately treating women, leading many both in the Republican Party and among Democrats to demand that he resign.
Shnayerson claimed that “abusive bullying” was part of the reason for the end of their marriage, according to the Post. He explained that a source close to the then-couple told him that she was “done being ridiculed and belittled.”
Once Kennedy had filed for divorce, according to the report, Cuomo refused to move out of their house or to respond to her lawyers. This went on for half a year.
Seven women have openly accused Cuomo of sexual misconduct so far.
Chuck Schumer (D-New York), the Jewish Senate majority leader, joined others.
A growing list of women, including former aides, have accused the governor of sexual misconduct, ranging from unwelcome flirtatious behavior at work to groping.
The new calls for Cuomo to resign came a day after more than 55 Democratic New York state lawmakers urged him to step down, and the state legislature said it would open an impeachment investigation into the allegations.

Abstract
Calcineurin (CaN), a heterodimeric Ca2+-calmodulin-dependent Ser/Thr phosphatase, regulates diverse pathways, from stress responses in yeast to T-cell activation and cardiac hypertrophy in humans. Calmodulin (CaM), an essential mediator of calcium–dependent signaling pathways, activates CaN in the presence of calcium by binding to an intrinsically disordered region of the enzyme and altering its conformation. My hydrodynamic studies have determined that CaM participates in a 1:1 complex with the CaM-binding domain of βCaN (CaNp, residues 400–423).
To explore the molecular mechanism of CaM association with CaN, I have used spectroscopic methods to determine the calcium-dependent and domain–specific interactions of CaM with CaNp. These studies revealed that the affinity of CaM1–148 for CaNp was weak in the absence of calcium, and very high (Kd in the nM to pM range) in the presence of calcium. I have demonstrated that CaNp binding to CaM increases the calcium–binding affinity of each domain of CaM1–148 to a similar degree, thereby retaining the property of sequential calcium binding to the domains, with preference for sites in the C–domain. This allows the N–domain to lag in response to an increase in cellular calcium and perhaps contribute to the regulation of CaN in a manner distinct from that of the C–domain.
NMR studies of calcium–saturated CaM1–148 demonstrated that the N–domain of CaM experienced a larger structural perturbation than the C–domain upon binding CaNp. Additional NMR studies revealed that CaNp adopts an anti–parallel orientation when bound to CaM, with the sole aromatic residue of CaNp contacting the N–domain of CaM. This contrasts with many CaM-target complexes in which the sole aromatic residue contacts the C–domain of CaM. Rigorous thermodynamic studies explored how mutations in the calcium-binding sites of mammalian CaM (mCaM) and mutations known to cause disruption of CaM–mediated ion channel regulation in Paramecia (PCaM) affected the allosteric interactions of the domains of CaM in the presence of CaNp. These studies demonstrated separable roles of the domains of CaM in recognition of CaNp. The consequences of a mutation depended upon its location within the complex. Collectively, research presented in this thesis provides insight into the mechanisms whereby the two domains of CaM contribute to recognition of CaN.

WALT: measure in litres (l).
Remember
Capacity is the amount of liquid a container can hold.
Volume is how much liquid is in the container.
We can measure both in millilitres and litres.
Measuring in litres
A litre is much more than a millilitre.
1 litre = 1000 millilitres
We shorten litre to ‘l’, so we might also say:
1 l = 1000 ml
We use litres to measure larger capacities, for example:
how much water you might drink in a day.
how much paint is needed to paint a room.
Tuesday
WALT: measure temperature (°C).
Visist and watch the videos. In the first video, you will learn about the unit of temperature, degrees Celsius (°C). You will read some thermometers and think about what each temperature feels like. In the second video, you will practise reading different thermometers. You will also think about how you can compare different temperatures.
- The greater the temperature, the warmer it is.
- The smaller the temperature, the cooler it is.
Wednesday
WALT: tell the time (o'clock and half past).
When the minute hand on a clock is pointing to 12, we say it is o'clock. When the minute hand points to 6, we say it is half past. Can you read the time on this clock?
On this clock above the minute hand is pointing to 12, so it is 'o'clock'. The hour hand points to 3, so it is 3 o'clock. What is the time on this clock?
On this clock, the minute hand points to 6 so it is ‘half-past’. The hour hand points halfway past 8 so it is ‘half past 8’.
Thursday
WALT: tell the time (quarter to and past).
When the minute hand is pointing to 3, we say it is a quarter past.
When the minute hand points to 9, we say it is a quarter to.
Follow the slideshow below to find out more. There are some questions at the end for you to try.
Friday
WALT: tell the time (to 5 minutes).
When the minute hand on a clock moves from one number to the next, it has moved 5 minutes.
There are 12 numbers around the clock face, and each interval is 5 minutes, so there are 12 × 5 = 60 minutes in an hour.
Let's use this knowledge to tell the time on the clocks below.
Top tip!
Check the minute hand to see if it shows minutes past or minutes to the hour.
Telling the time to 5 minutes

It has 29 percent of the province's land area. The island),[7] Newfoundland is the world's 16th-largest island, Canada's fourth-largest island, and the largest Canadian island outside the North.' (i.e., distinct from Labrador). By that classification, Newfoundland and its associated small islands have a total area of 111,390 square kilometres (43,008 sq mi).[8].[9] The island's total population as of the 2006 census was 479,105.
Long settled by indigenous peoples of the Dorset culture, the island was visited by the Icelandic Viking Leif Eriksson in the 11th century, who called the new land "Vinland". The next European visitors to Newfoundland were Portuguese, Basque, Spanish, French and English migratory fishermen. The island was visited by the Genoese navigator Portuguese and Latin.)
On August 5, 1583, Sir Humphrey Gilbert claimed Newfoundland as England's first overseas colony under Royal Charter of Queen Elizabeth I of England, thus officially establishing a forerunner to the much later British Empire.[10] Newfoundland is considered Britain's oldest colony.[11] At the time of English settlement, the Beothuk inhabited the island.
L'Anse aux Meadows was a Norse settlement near the northernmost tip of Newfoundland (Cape Norman), which has been dated to be approximately 1,000.[12] 19th.[13] The Gaelic names reflected the association with fishing: in Scottish Gaelic, it was called Eilean a' Trosg, or literally, "Island of the Cod".[14] Similarly, the Irish Gaelic name Talamh an Éisc means "Land of the Fish". later was declared "extinct" although people of partial Beothuk descent have been documented. The name Beothuk meant "people" in the Beothuk language which is often considered to be a member of the Algonquian language family although the lack of sufficient records means that it is not possible to confidently demonstrate such a connection.[15]
The tribe is now officially said.
When Europeans arrived from 1497 and later, starting with John Cabot, they established contact with the Beothuk. Estimates of the number of Beothuk on the island at this time vary, ranging from 700 to 5,000..
Newfoundland is the site of the only authenticated Nor.
Before and after the departure of the Norse, the island was inhabited by aboriginal populations.. His landing site is unknown but popularly believed to be Cape Bonavista, along the island's East coast..[16]
After Cabot, the first European visitors to Newfoundland were Portuguese, Basque,.
In July 1596 the Scottish vessel the "William" left Aberdeen for "new fund land (Newfoundland) and returned in 1600..[17]. He established the fishing town of Branch.[18] He and his cousin Father Patrick Power of Callan, County Kilkenny, spread Catholicism in Newfoundland. This settlement attracted a major migration of Irish Catholic immigrants to Newfoundland in the early eighteenth century.[19]
By the late 18th century, permanent settlement increased, peaking in the early years of the 19th century.[20]
The European immigrants, mostly English, Scots, Irish and French, built a society in the New World unlike the ones they had left. It was also different from those that. Even now, when the rest of Canada celebrates the founding of the country on July 1, many Newfoundlanders take part in solemn ceremonies of remembrance.
The Second World War also had a lasting effect on Newfoundland. In particular, the United States assigned forces to the military bases at Argentia, Gander, Stephenville, Goose Bay and St. John's.
Newfoundland and Labrador is the youngest province in Canada. Newfoundland was organised as a colony in 1825, was self-governing from 1855–1934, and held dominion status from 1907–1949 (see Dominion of Newfoundland). In June 22nd and July 3rd 1948, the population of the colony voted 52.3% to 47.7%[21] in favour of joining Canada as a province..[22].
The first flag to specifically represent Newfoundland is thought to have been an image of a green fir tree on a pink background that was in use in the early 19th century.[23],[24].[25].
The island has many, George Street, located in downtown St. John's, is closed to traffic 20 hours per day. The Mile One Stadium in St. John's is the venue for large sporting and concert events in the province.
In March, the annual seal hunt (of the harp seal) takes place.
Largest Municipalities (2011).[26]
Newfoundland has been the setting for numerous modern novels:
The show Republic of Doyle (2010-2014) is set in St John's and many of its stars are from Newfoundland.
Newfoundland has been depicted in paintings and art.
The musical Come From Away takes place in Newfoundland. The show tells the story of Operation Yellow Ribbon, the effort to help passengers stranded in Gander, Newfoundland in the aftermath of the 9/11 terrorist attacks.[27]
The island is home to many theatre festivals, including: Rising Tide Theatre Festival,[28] Gros Morne Theatre Festival,[29] and Grand Bank Theatre Festival.[30].

We’ve been a bit quiet on the Get YA Words Out blog and for this we apologise. July is officially here, which means Pride month is over (or at least that’s what we’ll tell the non-Queers *taps nose* *winks*), which means we should probably get back to working. Here’s some stuff we’re excited about this month.
1. Right now there are TWO competitions on that we are madly scribbling away for. One is the OutStanding Short Story Competition. Submissions are open until 1st September, so you have some time. This is great opportunity to experiment with new ideas outside of your manuscript. At 750 words, this competition is also a great exercise in being economical with your words.
The second competition is the biggie. The Ampersand Prize. This is the unpublished YA/MG manuscript competition run by Hargie Grant Egmont, previously won by Erin Gough for her AusQueerYA book, The Flywheel. The cut off is the end of July. We will be posting up a series of articles on how to polish your manuscript for submission throughout the month, so keep an eye out.
Details on both of these competitions can be found here.
2. Just because it’s July and even in Perth it’s cold and miserable, doesn’t mean stuff isn’t happening. The Emerging Writer’s Festival have a call out for artists to submit proposals for the Digital Writer’s Festival. The Digital Writer’s Festival is completely online, which is fantastic for people like us who live in Perth where nothing happens, but the weather is usually good so ya know, pros and cons I guess. Check out the details here. Artists are paid for their work. Even if you don’t participate, definitely check it out in October (don’t worry, we’ll remind you).
3. We have some other cool stuff in the works for this month, but obviously it’s top secret (mainly because all our ideas are so poorly thought out a majority of them should never make it past the brainstorming stage). We love projects. If you have something you’ve been thinking about and need a hand fine tuning, or just want a sounding board, hit us up via the contact link. We want to get all the words out and are happy to help where we can, or if we can’t help, point you in the direction of some amazing people who know way more than us and are way cooler than us (not a tall order really).
That’s it for now. Happy writing!Introduction:
One cannot now deny the inevitability of communication for development in the changing global perspective. With the radical change in the perception of development and increased electronic media in the 90s, the role of communication in development has increased tremendously. The term ‘development’ now connotes ‘human development’ or in other words, development of human beings, through creating social and economic opportunities for them and widening human choices to bring changes in their lives. People must be at the center of human development. Development has to be woven around people, not people around the economic development. It has to be the development of the people, by the people, for the people with the role of communication in the economic development of Bangladesh.
Information and communication technology (ICT) is increasingly being recognized as a powerful enabler for economic and social development. ICT can advance economic growth, enhance social inclusion, increase health and education services and improve governance at all levels. The United Nations Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) recognize the potentials of ICT for development and MDG 8 (Target 17) calls “to develop a global partnership for development and, in cooperation with the private sector, make available the benefits of new technologies — especially information and communication technologies.” Despite its potential, ICT is by no means a panacea. ICT can also introduce new ways for fraud and corruption to occur, and its inappropriate application can sometimes derail development outcomes. ICT can also deepen existing inequalities and misdirect scarce resources. When thinking about ICT for development, it is thus crucial to foster an enabling, trustworthy, transparent and non-discriminatory environment that promotes the responsible and effective use of ICT for development for the benefit of all.
Role of Communication in The Economic Development of Bangladesh:
The role of communication plays a vital role in the economic development of Bangladesh. They are given below:
Summary of Findings from 2006 World Bank Report on communication for Development:
• Communication plays a vital role in advancing economic growth and reducing poverty. A survey of firms carried out in 56 developing countries found that firms that use Communication grow faster, invest more, and are more productive and profitable than those that do not.
• Over the past 25 years, developing countries have considerably increased Communication access, especially for telephone services. Between 1980 and 2005, the number of telephone subscribers in developing countries increased by over 30 fold. In 1980, developing countries accounted for only 20 percent of the world’s telephone lines. In 2005, 60 percent of telephone lines globally were in developing countries. This expansion has been driven by the technological revolution of mobile telephony, as well as by increased private sector competition.
• Opening up to private sector competition has led to huge inflows of investment from overseas. Between 1990 and 2003, 122 of 154 developing countries received about USD $200 billion in foreign investment for telecommunications alone.
• While the transition to well-regulated and competitive service provision is important for increasing Communication access, there is some way to go in this transition. For example, nearly half of countries globally retain monopolies on the service provision of Communication.
• While the developing world has seen huge progress in the rollout of basic Communication infrastructure, the picture is more mixed for the advanced use of Communication. Worldwide, Internet use more than quadrupled between 2000 and 2005, but differences in the number of secure Internet servers, a proxy for the availability of e-commerce, remain stark. While developed nations on average reported more than 300 secure Internet servers per 1 million people, developing nations reported less than 2.
• There is a continued need for government and private sector support of initiatives that extend “access” to Communication. The report describes innovative examples of public-private partnerships that can extend access to Communication in rural and remote areas.
• A review of 40 national e-strategies from developing countries found that more than 85 percent of these strategies aim to expand Communication use in governments and schools, expand telecommunications infrastructure, and provide for an adequate legal and regulatory framework.
Transport Communication:
The role of an efficient transport and communication system is extremely critical for the socio- economic progress of a country. As physical infrastructure is indispensable, a well-knit transport and communication network ensures a well balanced distribution system for the means of production, efficient marketing of produced commodities, maintaining stability of price and rapid industrialization. In the current context of globalization and market economy, there is a critical need for evolving a developed and well knit transport and communication system that should be able to integrate Bangladesh with the international transport and communication network. Realizing this importance, the concerned ministries and their agencies continue to exert their concerted efforts to develop the system. In the Revised Annual Development Programer (RADP) of FY 2004-05 there is an allocation of TK. 4543.77 crore for transport and communication sector. In FY 2004-05, the contribution of this sector to the GDP at constant prices is about 10.01 percent (provisional). The transport and communication network in Bangladesh has evolved with roads, railway, and water and air transport as well as post telecommunication and information technology.
Jamuna Multipurpose Bridge Authority (JMBA)
Jamuna Bridge is playing a vital role in road transport system. The Bridge has made the communication between eastern and northern region of the country easier. As a result the producers are getting fair prices of their produces which are encouraging them to produce more. This, in effect, is inducing increased production. Beside, with the establishment of new industries economic activities in the north west zone increased manifold. Therefore there is an increasing trend toll collection. Because of construction of a dual gauge railway across Tangail under Jamuna Rail link project, it was possible to set up a direct railway link between the capital city Dhaka and Rajshahi and Khulna Division. Alongside setting up fail and electricity line gas line has been set up over the bridge.
Other Projects for Construction of Bridge
To provide support to the development of transport infrastructure facilities in Metropolitan Area Dhaka Transport Co-ordination Board (DTCB) was established in 2001 by and Act. Its main objectives are to develop a planned and environment friendly transport system in close cooperation between the public and private sector.
Bangladesh Road Transport Corporation (BRTC)
BRTC has a rich tradition as an entity. To establish a sound transport system BRTC was established in 1961 by an Ordinance. Its main objectives are to:
1. Ensure a cheap, speedy, secured, comfortable and modern transportation
system.
2. Help develop non-government transport system.
3. Play an important role in controlling the transport quality and transport
fare.
4. Development skilled manpower in transport sector thorough training.
5. Play a strategic intervention role for a sound and organized transport
system.
Railway Communication:
Bangladesh Railway is regarded as a cheap and eco-friendly mode of transport. In maritime trade, the Chittagong Sea Port plays a major role. Beside the role or Mongla Sea port and Bangladesh Inland water Transport Authority is also important in transporting passengers and freights. Bangladesh Shipping Corporation is working to provide efficient shipping facilities on international water route. The Department or Shipping performs its regulatory role by enforcing relevant maritime laws and also protects the interest of the crews. Public and private initiative is continuing in the infrastructure development of the land ports established near the border areas or the country. Civil Aviation Authority is responsible for establishment and development of the infrastructure necessary for aircraft operation and at present, it is maintaining 3 international and 5 domestic airports.
Rail transport is a public sector concern. Bangladesh Railway has a total 2,768 route kilometers at the end of the financial year 2000-01 and operates through 452 rail stations nationwide. About ninety percent of the country’s area is accessible by railway.
Growth of Bangladeshi’s Software Sector
The growth of Bangladeshi’s software sector has been striking over the past decade. In 2005–06, Bangladeshi’s software and related services industry, which includes IT enabling services (ITES—including human resources, costumer care, payment services, finance, etc), grew by 28 percent, accounting for 4.8 percent of GDP compared with 0.5 percent in 1996–97. Services and software exports remain the mainstay of the sector with an estimated export growth of over 32 percent for FY07. India is also the global leader in the provision of business process outsourcing, exporting US$25 billion per year worth of these services, a figure that is expected to rise to US$60 billion by 2010.
Electronic mail, popularly known as ‘e-mail’, is the communication of textual messages via electronic means. Electronic mail communication is user to user via the computer. E-mail is delivered to individual electronic mail boxes based in computers. In order to operate an e-mail system, we need a personal computer, a modem & a telephone connection. The world is getting so smaller & smaller with the blessing of science. Now a man from one part of the world can communicate with a person of another part of the world within a second. E-mail has made this process easier. E-mail, communication in the latest invention in the communication system. It helps all classes of people.
An important advantage of e-mail is its ability to reduce the consumption of paper in the office. Internal memos & reports can be exchanged electronically without using paper. Being a computer based messaging system; files prepared on computers can be instantly copied & easily exchanged as e-mail. This facility has the potential of improving office efficiency considerably.
Being a person to person communication, e-mail turns out to be a cheaper alternative to telephone conversation 7 eliminates the time spent in establishing phone calls. For a telephone conversation to materialize both the caller & being present simultaneously. Privacy is ensured as the mail is delivered to an individual’s mail box which can be accessed or opened only by the intended recipient.
E-mail has brought about a revolution in modern communication. Messages can be transmitted from one country to another within seconds. It is far cheaper than telephone calls. Trade & commerce has become greatly dependent on this speedy mode of communication. It has, however, not reached every one, especially in developing countries like ours, as most people can not afford to have a personal computer. But even here people have started using commercially operated e-mail facilities for important purposes.

Capabilities:
There are several different indicators of fax capabilities: Group, class, data transmission rate, and conformance with ITU-T (formerly CCITT) recommendations.Fax machines utilize standard PSTN lines and telephone numbers.
Group:
(a)Analog:
Group 1 and 2 faxes were sent in the same manner as a frame of analog television, with each scanned line transmitted as a continuous analog signal. Horizontal resolution depended upon the quality of the scanner, transmission line, and the printer. Analog of 100 scan lines per inch. Group 2 fax machines are almost obsolete, and are no longer manufactured. Group 2 fax machines can interoperate with Group 3 fax machines.
(b (‘Standard’)
- Vertical: 200 or 196 scan lines per inch (‘Fine’)
- Vertical: 400 or 391 (note not 392) scan lines per inch (‘Superfine’)
- Horizontal: 300 scan lines per inch
- Vertical: 300 scan lines per inch ‘Super Group 3’ faxes use V.34bis modulation that allows a data rate of up to 33.6 kbit/s.
As a security precaution, thermal fax paper is typically not admissible as evidence in a court of law unless photocopied. This is because the ink used on fax papers are delible, brittle and tend to come off over long periods of storage.
Document exchange through facsimile systems is emerging as a major application of telecommunication due to its speed of transmission. A telephone connection is necessary for operating it. The fax machine is capable of transmitting & receiving printed matter, which may include graphics, drawing, pictures, hand written texts etc. This it highly suitable for business & official purposes which deal mostly with paper documents.
There are two types of Fax systems- the photographic & the document. In the photographic fax, black & white as well as gray level information is transmitted & printed. Typically there are 8 16 levels that can be recognized by the system. The document system handles only black & white levels. Generally the document facsimile is more popular than photographic system.
Fiber-Optic communications:
Abstract – This paper presents a technical overview of some of the underlying principles of the modern telecommunication technology and the evolution of microwave radio, satellite systems and various optical fiber based infrastructures..
Satellite & Microwave Technology:
Since the introduction of modulated microwaves in the 1920’s for communication between two distant points, this technology has gone through a tremendous amount of development. However, these links were limited to distances within the ‘line of sight’ (roughly 30 kilometers). Thus, the need for orbiting satellites to relay information over long distances was realized; pilot concepts evolved in the early 1950 ‘see’ nearly one half of the Earth from this vantage point. To provide continuous coverage to any point on Earth, only three satellites in such an orbit are sufficient [1]. However, signals are weakened about a hundred times after traveling these large link distances, thus necessitating the usage of high gain antennas and powerful transmitters. A more pertinent problem, however, is the delay and echo often experienced in long distance phone calls that use these satellites.
Optical Fiber Technology:
Faced with the aforementioned fundamental shortfalls of a satellite-based system, real interest in optical communication was aroused with the invention of the laser in early 1960’s. Proposals for using optical fibers to avoid degradation of the optical signal while propagating through the atmosphere were made almost simultaneously in 1966 [2]. Early systems exhibited high attenuation (1000 dB/km). Today, less than 40 years on, attenuation of less than 0.2 dB/km is easily achieved for a carrier wavelength of 1.55m as shown in Figure 2. Figure 2: Loss characteristics of a silica optical fiber showing the three wavelengths of interest. Thus the majority of the transmission and receiver systems are geared for operation at this wavelength.

Economic Benefits Of A Better Communication System:
The advantages and benefits that telecommunication can bring in education, commercial, medical and governmental activities are too numerous to mention, suffice it to say that its expansion plays an important role in the economic and social development of a country. One important benefit of a penetrative telecom infrastructure is that it can enhance instant communication between Bangladeshis on the one hand and people in distant places around the globe on the other.. Improving the telecom infrastructure will reduce the cost of local and international phone calls to and from Bangladesh enabling Bangladeshis to join the international community. Communication technology also serves as a “Market maker”. Given the often intense economic competition among nations, missed opportunities due to lack of communications access will have more dire consequences in the future .
Unlike some of its predecessors, fiber optics technology has many unrivaled advantages, some of which are listed below:
1. Enormous potential bandwidth: The optical carrier frequency in the range 1013 to 1014Hz.
4. Signal security: as light from a fiber does not radiate significantly, a transmitted optical signal cannot be obtained non-invasively, thus ensuring a high degree of signal security.
Internet:
Internet is the largest discovery of science & the greatest advancement in the field of communication. It is the computerized process with telephone set. To get internet connection, it requires a modern telephone line & a different sort of software for using the network system. Like telephone number internet is maintained by its own number. There are two types of internet. They are on-line internet & off-line internet. Internet usually gets connection from three networking systems. They are LAN (Local Area Network). MAN (Metropoliton Area Network) & WAN (World Wide Area Network). Now- a- days an internet is of great, use to us. It has made the world smaller & brought the world within our reach. We can get information on every matter within a very short time. It has widened our knowledge & made us thirstier for the unknown. It is a miracle. It works like Aladin’s magic Lamp.
Internet is a computerized network of information. The activities of the internet are very smooth, easy & rapid. A man can dial a number from his computer & a link to the internet will soon give him a connection in & outside the country according to his expectation.
The first connectivity of internet was only in 1996. Though It was somewhat late, over the past few years the growth is rapid. The government’s high internet tariff is impeding the growth of this sector. Recently the government is decided to reduce the tariff 50%.[3] is now 450,000(2007) compared to 100,000 in 2000.
(a)Broadband Internet Access:
Though broadband internet access is available it charges high for high speed connection than other south asian countries.Broadband internet and e-commerce in Bangladesh is slowly progressing.WiMAX service is now available from some internet service providers.

They have limited coverage. They are broadcasting in Dhaka and its surrounding areas.
Radio is an important entertainment source for the general people. We can get great pleasure by hearing radio. Specially, now-a-days we are habituated to hear FM radio. Most of the programs are much more standard.
We can get latest news from radio. We also get information about market price, traffic Jam information, latest songs information, latest movies information, celebrity information, food raspy, funny jokes, love story of an individual person, new product information, political information, business information etc from radio channels.Sometimes radio channels provide programs live telecast. That time general people can send their SMS to express their opinion or what they think. They also send questions for the celebrity to know about them
Satellite Channels:
The channels that go air world-wide & are telecast with the help of satellite are satellite channels. Dish antenna is large sized & dish shaped. It is much improved & more powerful version of the earlier antennas. Dish antenna has brought about a revolutionary change in the world of showbiz. It can provide thousand connections simultaneously. Through dish antenna now one can watch any program of any channel on T.V. Earlier, the views could watch only domestic T.V. programs. Sometimes, it was boring & dull. But the viewers had no way out of this.
Now dish antenna has offered the viewers thousand options. One can watch sports, movies, news & many other entertainment programs whenever he likes. Dish antenna has world closer than it was before.
There are many advantages of satellite channels. We can learn many types, of educational things. We can also know about co curriculum works. It also increases our creativity & brave. We can watch adventurous things by the satellite.
We can use new types of channels through satellite channels. Our creativity will be improved by satellite channels. Then our brave will be increased by satellite channels.
Telecommunication:
Bangladesh Telephone Board
The Bangladesh Telephone (T&T) Department was created under the Ministry of Posts & Telecommunications after the independence of Bangladesh in 1971 to run the telecommunication services on a commercial basis. In 1976, Bangladesh T&T Department was converted into a corporate body.
In pursuance of an ordinance promulgated by the president on 24 February 1979, the department was restructured into Bangladesh Telephone and Telegraph Board (BTTB) with a mandate to provide basic telecommunication services throughout the country.
Today ‘BTTB’ provides land-line telephone services in the urban areas, domestic long-distance and international services. Though the Bangladeshi government has given out nationwide PSTN licences the lucrative Dhaka market (which account for majority of the nationwide market) is still under the monopoly of BTTB.
In 2004, BTTB forayed in to the mobile telephony market of Bangladesh by launching a subsidiary company called Teletalk.
BTTB provides dial-up Internet access in all 64 districts of the country, making it the most-accessible Internet service provider in the country.As of June 2008 its total dial-up subscriber is 28659. It also handles the .bd domain.
As of March 2008 total subscriber of BTTB was 872.409 thousand.
Telecom System in Bangladesh:
The Bangladesh telecommunications system contains several subsystems. A general assessment of the telephone system is that it is totally inadequate for a modern country.[citation needed]The domestic system is undergoing modernization. Digital systems; trunk systems including VHF and UHF microwave radio relay links, and some fiber-optic cable are being introduced in the cities. The international system consists of two Intelsat satellites in geostationary orbit, international radiotelephone communications and landline services to neighboring countries.
Code System: The telecom sector in Bangladesh is rapidly emerging.
The area code has 1-4 digits.
The Subscriber Number has 3-7 digits.
The Trunk Prefix is “0”.
The international prefix is “00”.
The International code is “0088” or, “+88” (Bangladesh).
Calling Code: +880 – Sub Codes

We can express our all the opinion through telecommunication. That’s why most of the telecommunication company has reduced their mobile service cost. We can call to others, chat with others, send massages, browse, use internet, picture messages etc. It is very cheap.
Television:
The word “Television” is derived from the Greek word “Tele” which means distance & the Latin word “Visio” which means vision. It is one of the most wonderful inventions of modern science. The idea of television first came to Paul Nipkow, a German scientist. Later it was invented by Bayard, a British scientist in 1925. After the Second World War it has become very popular all over the world. It is an audio- visual instrument & the most powerful medium for mass education, recreation & advertisement..
List Of Television Stations:
The first television signal broadcast in Bangladesh was in 1964 by the state-owned television network BTV. From then onwards BTV had a virtual monopoly until the late 1990’s. Ever since then a number of stations had arrived. Many have also shut down in the process.
Terrestrial networks
Satellite networks:Almost every channel is broadcast from the Telstar 10 satellite with the exception of ATN Bangla which is broadcast from Thaicom2/5
The number of private satellite channels is growing. The first private channel in Bangladesh was ATN Bangla

Telex:
Telex communication is also electronic in nature. Telex communication is terminal to terminal. In telex, messages designed to a number of users are sent to the same terminal from where it is distributed in a printed from by an operator.
1) 2-ply and 3-ply
2) Size: different sizes available
3) Carbonless paper roll
4) Instant and clear copy image, which presents excellent optical density and light
resistance;
5) Good dimensional stability and curl control for converting;
6) High surface strength, can not smear or rub off onto hands or clothes.
Many companies have been providing Telex services to its international customers. As the use of telex services declines around the world this companies remain committed to its long term provision. Save costs with no need for server software, desk top licenses, modems, hardware, telex lines or expensive maintenance contracts. This companies also provides internet Telex solutions. They are given below:
Wireless Communication:
Wireless Connectivity:
Wireless – Term describing communication that requires no wire between two communicating points.
Connectivity – The ability to connect communications systems to exchange data or share resources.
Wireless Connectivity – Wireless connectivity involves all the new wireless devices and technology. It brings in all the new ways of collaboration, mobile, so that now we can manipulate, share and shape our digital content from anywhere, with anyone totally mobility.
Wireless can be divided into some groups such as:
*
Wireless LAN:
A wireless LAN or WLAN is a wireless local area network, which is the linking of two or more computers without using wires. WLAN utilizes spread-spectrum technology based on radio waves to enable communication between devices in a limited area, also known as the basic service set. This gives users the mobility to move around within a broad coverage area and still be connected to the network.
Wireless Network Types
When we look at Wi-Fi specifically, which is what most of the jobs out there pertain to today, and the newest and hottest technology, there are 4 major types of wireless choices.
1999 – 802.11b
As of right now, 802.11b costs the least, and is the type that is most common on college campuses, homes and businesses. Has a range of about 150 feet, and transfers at 11 Mbps @ 2.4 GHz. 32 users per access point. (LOTS OF AP’s for COLLEGES). AP: $55-160 Card: $30-90
2001 – 802.11a
Not compatible with 802.11b, range of 75 feet. 64 users per access point. Not widely used. Most used in large corporation, where many users can access a AP in a small area. AP $100-130 card $100
2003 – 802.11g
Backwards compatible with 802.11b, 64 users per ‘g’ access point. G AP’s have a range of 150 feet. ‘G’ spots are not very popular since the technology is new, but the g card can be used at 802.11b spots. Big Benefit. AP: $130-200 Card: $80-130
2003 – 802.11a/g
a/g spots have the largest load of 128 users per AP. The a/g card is backwards compatible with b, a, and g since it houses all the technologies in one card. a/g spots are rare, but the card is backwards compatible with every Wi-Fi technology. Most expensive technology, but well worth it. AP: $300 Card: $100
Bluetooth:
Bluetooth is a radio standard and communications protocol primarily designed for low power consumption, with a short range (power class dependent: 1 meter, 10 meters, 100 metres) based around, so long as the received transmission is powerful enough.
Bluetooth is in a variety of new products such as phones, printers, modems, and headsets. Bluetooth is acceptable for situations when two or more devices are in close proximity with each other and don’t require high bandwidth. Bluetooth is most commonly used with phones and hand-held computing devices, either using a Bluetooth handset or transferring files from phones/PDAs to computers. Since Bluetooth uses short-range radio frequencies, it is not as effective for setting up networks that can be accessed from remote locations as Wi-Fi is.
Cell Phones:
A mobile or cellular telephone is a long-range, portable electronic device for personal telecommunications over long distances.
Mobile phones and the network they operate under vary significantly from provider to provider,.
Experience of GrameenPhone in Bangladesh
Since it first launched its services in Bangladesh in 1997, GrameenPhone has contributed to the country’s social and economic development by fostering mobile penetration. Through its low pricing strategy, the company was able to increase competition, quickly bring down prices in the telecommunication sector and help increase mobile penetration from 0.3 percent in 1997 to over six percent in 2004. Besides connecting previously remote and unconnected areas, the company’s Village Phone (VP) Program has allowed mainly low income women in rural areas to borrow enough money to buy a handset, a subscription and cover incidental expenses so as to start their own pay telephone jobs, including for dealers, agents, contractors, suppliers, and Village Phone operators. GrameenPhone is also one of Bangladesh’s largest private sector investors, as well as one of largest taxpayers in the country. By 2004, its contribution to the government represented 0.4 percent of the country’s entire GDP.

VOIP
Voice over Internet Protocol, also called VOIP, IP Telephony, Internet telephony, Broadband Telephony, Broadband phone & voice over broadband is the routing of voice conversations over the Internet or through any other IP-Based Network.
Skype users essentially make telephone calls and video calls through their computer using Skype software and the internet. The basis of the system is free communication between users of Skype software; however the product also allows Skype users to communicate with users of regular landline and mobile telephones. This software is currently available free of charge and can be downloaded from the company website, but the software is proprietary and the Skype protocol is unpublished..
Bangladeshi Telecommunication:
The entire world uses cellphones, most of the cellphone providers in Bangladesh use 2.5G GSM except for Citycell which uses CDMA. The rest of the world has sort of moved on to higher speeds on phones using 3G which transfers at 1.5mbps per second onwards. Although Bangladesh is coming up to faster speeds with EDGE which is 384 kbps to 1.5mbps. Cell phone providers major subscribers are mostly lower class people so they cannot afford to buy cell phones with video calls and other multimedia features. Bangladesh ISP’s also provide wireless connections to people in remote places with high speed internet connections. Wireless LAN also plays a big role on the impact for education in Bangladesh. Two examples of schools in Bangladesh using wireless LAN in education are International School Dhaka and American International School Dhaka. These schools use WLAN to promote research in the classrooms and to share multimedia and work over a network. Voip is also another emerging development in Bangladesh, some companies are selling calling cards and they provide calls with VOIP on their servers.
The mobile phone industry in Bangladesh is growing rapidly, and is making a significant contribution to economic development and employment generation. The number of mobile subscribers increased to 11 million in 2006, from 3.85 million in 2004, registering an impressive growth of 186%. Consequently, the country’s mobile telecom density went up to 6.7% from 2.75% during these few years. Among the five companies that are currently operating, Grameen Phone (in partnership with Telenor of Norway), which has the highest market share, more than doubled its customer base to over 6 million during this period. Other companies, which include Aktel, Banglalink, CityCell, and Teletalk, also experienced robust growth in terms of number of subscribers and customer revenue. A sixth operator, Warid Telecom, is preparing to enter the market after obtaining an operating license in December 2005.
Cell Phones
Wireless LAN & Internet:
GrameenPhone, the largest mobile phone company in Bangladesh, pioneered a successful project to bring mobile phones to the country’s villages and is now moving on to providing Internet access. After a successful pilot project, the company decided this month to set up 500 Internet access points, which it is calling community information centers, across Bangladesh by year-end
The announcement came a week after the Nobel Peace Prize was awarded to Grameen Bank, the parent company of one of GrameenPhone’s two corporate owners. The other is Telenor, the Norwegian telecommunications company.
The centers will be run by local entrepreneurs who will either invest their own money or be given access to small loans to cover set-up costs, which GrameenPhone estimates will be $800 to $1,400. The centers will be positioned to serve 15 villages and about 40,000 people and will have a computer, a Web cam, a printer, a scanner and other basic equipment. The Internet access will come by way of a connection to GrameenPhone’s GSM mobile phone network, which can download data at about 128 kilobits per second, not quite broadband but faster than a dial-up connection.
Conclusion:
The role of communication in the economic development of Bangladesh, which is to be communicated, how and why-are key question in communication. In disseminating the message, selection of appropriate media is as important as language. Wrong selection of media and inadequate and improper communication supports lead to failure in development.

One airline plans to offer what it says is a solution to travellers stressed by screaminig children – Child-free Zones.
Airline carrier Air Asia says from February 2013 it will provide a “quiet zone” for passengers aged 12 and over at no extra cost.
Their decision follows a 2012 survey that claimed a majority of British travellers supported child-free flights. Malaysian Airlines already ban children from top deck of their A380 aircraft and WestJet announced a plan to pack children in boxes in cargo hold (turns out to be an April fool!).
Separated from the rest of the cabin by toilets and bulkheads, seven rows of economy class seats should be immune from the sound of infant tantrums, Air Asia claims.
For the childless and the easily irritable, it may be a blessed relief. Equally, many parents will surely be disgruntled at the suggestion they should be segregated from other passengers like second-class citizens.
Typically, UK train operators which provide “quiet coaches” instruct commuters not to use their phones and ensure music devices aren’t heard by other passengers – but no mention is made of infant noise pollution.
A poll by Tripadvisor in August found that over a third of Britons would be prepared to pay extra to travel by air without the presence of children.
In smaller aircraft, with different layouts to those used by Air Asia and Malaysia Airlines, screening off the sound of crying children will not always be practical. Adult-only flights would mean reducing the number of available customers, and thus have a negative impact on profitability.Ice storage

ATT Building & Roofing Services Ltd provide a loft conversion service to the Anniesland area.
Loft Conversions Solutions
Depending on the space available and the design of your house, there are a lot of things you can do with a loft conversion in Anniesland. If the room can accommodate it and you can add a staircase to comply with building regulations, there is a lot you can do with a loft.
Transforming it into a bathroom and dressing room is a popular option for the ladies. This takes away the need to store all of your clothes in the bedroom and creates a dedicated space to get ready for work or a social event.
The room can also be a bedroom and is a popular option for older kids such as teenagers. It allows them to have a space away from the rest of the house a little and give them privacy as needed. Adding the right windows and window blinds makes the space private from the outside too.
A dedicated cinema room or games room are other good ideas for what to do with a converted loft. Depending on the shape of the space, you can add sofas, a large screen TV and games equipment to make a space away from the living room that will be hugely popular with the kids.
Lofts can be converted into a useful storage space too, better than the bare boards and lamp system that many of us use currently. There are less regulations involved if the loft is purely a storage space while you can still add roof windows to get light and air into the space.

NORTH CHARLESTON, S.C. (WCSC) - North Charleston community members gathered in the parking lot of the Piggly Wiggly on Rivers Road to light a candle for CJ Brown Junior. The 19-year-old was shot and killed just inside the store on the night of Oct. 29 when North Charleston police say Jerrold Cooper Junior, 34, entered the store looking for his girlfriend and began shooting.
Donnimechia Singleton knew Brown. He says the man was known to be a hard worker and a genuine person.
“This is someone who was a law-abiding citizen, just going to work. He just graduated from high school,” Singleton said. “The family and the community are taking this one really hard.”
Family and friends gathered for the Friday night vigil decked out in black and yellow in honor of Brown who was a serious Pittsburg Steelers Football fan. Beyond his love for sports, Brown was known to be a friendly face in the community. Singleton lives in the same neighborhood as Brown did and says he would see Brown regularly interacting with the community.
“CJ would come out because he had multiple family members that lived in the community and he would walk from one family member to the next saying, ‘Hey how are you doing, good evening.’ He was a humble, respectable young man,” Singleton said. “He was a real example, a good example in the community.”
Throughout the vigil, speakers shared personal experiences of homicides in their own families and renewed calls for change. Ronald Smith was one of those speakers. His 14-year-old daughter, Ronjanae, was killed earlier this year in a mass shooting in North Charleston.
“We have to continue to come together and try to figure out something that we can do to stop the gun violence,” Smith said. “I haven’t grieved yet. I have my boots on the ground and I have been pushing and I have been trying to figure out a change that we can make for the younger generation, so we can save the youth.”
North Charleston Police Chief Reggie Burgess attended the vigil railing against laws that allow people easy access to guns, but also saying he believes the community is stepping up to get criminals off the streets. He says it’s hard to arrest people and keep them in jail if the community is not willing to work with police. He met with Brown’s family the day after the shooting.
“You know the thing that I really love was they were talking about how we can prepare for the case to go to court and that’s what we love. They were in support of what we were doing,” Burgess said. “They want to make sure that we were going to be focused when we get in that court room so the person who is responsible can be held accountable fully. In the 32 years I have been doing this thing, that’s different. Sometimes the family will talk to you and sometimes they won’t. This family welcomed us.”
Police were able to identify Cooper quickly and make an arrest because of witnesses cooperating with officers. Cooper is charged with murder, attempted murder and possession of a weapon during a violent crime and is currently being held in the Al Cannon Detention Center.Brother DZ2750 is a very good advanced sewing machine. The issue is, you are paying more for just an additional sewing feet when compared to Brother DZ2400.

- 185 built-in stitches including 130 sewing stitches and 55 alphanumeric stitches

Brother DZ2750 Review
Sewing Machine Reviews Recommendation Level : MODERATE
This is a sewing machine based on Brother DZ2400 with a couple of additional features. In the review of Brother DZ3000, I have already told you that all 3 sewing machines DZ2400, DZ2750 and DZ3000 are virtually the same. The only difference is the couple of extra features that come with DZ2750 and DZ3000. If you came here to read a review of Brother DZ2750, you can read the review of Brother DZ2400 to avoid repetition as both the machines are same. The slight difference between the two models are discussed in the section below.
Brother DZ2750 Vs Brother DZ2400
There is no difference in the number of stitches or sewing speed. The main differences are
- The LCD display is slightly larger on Brother DZ2750.
- The second difference is that DZ2750 comes with13 sewing feet instead of 12
Everything else is the same.
Verdict
Brother DZ2750 is a good sewing machine for advanced users, no question about it. But it costs few more dollars than DZ2400. Literally you are paying more money for the additional sewing feet (The LCD display size difference is marginal, so you can ignore it). The price is a deal blower for me and I will go with Brother DZ2400. You can decide whether it is really worth spending more money for just 1 sewing feet.Red Furniture Sets Cozy Gray Wicker Patio Chairs With Red Cushions And Small End Table On Stone Flooring For Red Outdoor Furniture Sets

This year, our state representatives and senators have the opportunity to pass legislation that would help millions of working Floridians. If passed, The Working Families Tax Credit Program (Senate Bill 1786 and House Bill 1411) would grant additional funds for individuals and families who currently qualify for the federal Earned Income Tax Credit (EITC). This would increase the tax credits for working families, allowing those earning low wages to better keep up with the rising costs of living.
Research and polling show that voters of all backgrounds and political persuasions are extremely supportive of legislation that would assist working families navigate the rising costs of healthcare, childcare, and housing.
HEALTHCARE
No one should have to forgo necessary preventative care because they can’t afford it. But millions of hardworking families, seniors, veterans, disabled individuals, and children are unable to see a doctor regularly due to a lack of affordable coverage. This leaves too many in a desperate situation in which one major illness or catastrophic injury would result in bankruptcy.
In Florida, more than 2.8 million people are uninsured. That number doesn’t include Floridians with bare minimum, high deductible coverage that they cannot afford to use.
AFFORDABLE HOUSING.

At no point does Chuck Workman's relentlessly entertaining documentary Magician: The Astonishing Life & Work of Orson Welles state that as a thesis, but the parallels are hard to miss. Both were preternaturally talented artists who made works in their early 20s that simultaneously defined and altered their chosen industries, and then spent the rest of their careers and lives flaming out, constantly working but never given the freedom to repeat or even approach their earlier successes. Certainly, neither of them can be summed up in a 94-minute documentary; multiple documentaries and narrative films have been made about Welles' Citizen Kane (still the greatest film ever made, full stop) and his panic-inducing 1938 War of the Worlds broadcast, but if nothing else, Magician is a good primer for those who are unfamiliar with Welles, while functioning as a greatest-hits reel for students of the man. It also helps that the man in question talked a great deal on camera about his life, and while it's noted that he wasn't the most reliable narrator, he was never less than entertaining. And if Magician inspires the uninitiated to check out Citizen Kane, Touch of Evil, or F for Fake, that'll be the best trick of all.Time is paramount for any successful business operation.

It’s super interesting to witness Wiz Khalifa and Jaden Smith in heels with their suits. The Meta Gala brought out the best in men’s style. Asking for a friend, can regular dudes wear heels, too?
A Wiz in heels.
Unlike rapper Future who apparently had to be convinced to wear a silk ribbon tied in a bow, Wiz Khalifa was happy to wear his Thom Browne suit with heels boots. Blunt included.
Even Jaden Smith , who wore Louis Vuitton, milly rocked in platform heels on the Meta Gala red carpet. He commented about how slippery, but cool his heeled boots felt during his video interview with Andre Leon Tally on Vogue.com. They were basically platforms- Spice Girls style!
We believe – dare – I – say – it- that a chunky heeled boot for men can look strikingly high fashion. It’s gives off major coming of age style. Real men wear heels.
So dudes, I pose this question to you today, would you wear heels to a black tie affair too?

It was a rainy evening and we were stuck in the middle of rush-hour traffic. “So where is this place?” my husband asked rather tetchily. (He hates traffic – with traffic in the rain being higher on his dislike list – hence the reason for his growing annoyance…)
“My love, it’s not that far away – I promise,” I crooned – secretly praying that the traffic would be forgiving and deliver us to our destination without too many more delays.
Luckily for me, we didn’t have to sit in the traffic for too much longer as we arrived at the HTA School of Culinary Art – the venue for that evening’s monthly practice session for the South African Culinary Olympics team. I bid a hasty farewell to my husband and went inside the HTA building where a feast of culinary delights awaited me.
The Culinary Olympics was first staged in Frankfurt, Germany in 1896. The aim of the competition is to showcase the competing countries’ cuisines to the world as well as to grow and develop the culinary skills of all chefs who participate.
Participants are judged on all aspects of the dining experience that they present – from the presentation of the food on the plate right down to the table décor. (For a glimpse into how the extravaganza is put together, have a look at the following video. It is in German, however what you can appreciate is the sheer magnitude and attention to detail that goes into all aspects of the Culinary Olympics.)
We were treated like kings and queens, and were spoiled with taste sensations reminiscent of South Africa and all her delights that I’d never before experienced:
- For starters, we had Cape Lobster ‘Malay’ – poached crayfish, pressed carrot terrine, carrot mayonnaise and Malay curry sauce. This dish was created by Dion Vengatass of the Mount Nelson.
- Main course was Springbok ‘Masakhane’ – pan-roasted loin of springbok, rolled veal sweetbreads, red cabbage and cider puree, savoy cabbage and Boulangére potatoes. The main was the vision of Henrico Grobbelaar, who is the executive chef at the Twelve Apostles.
- Dessert – which was regarded by many as the piéce de resistance – consisted of a white chocolate and coconut mousse, rose gel, coconut sorbet and pulled sugar. Uber-talented pastry chef, Minette Smith, created this masterpiece.
Here is what some of the other diners thought:

06. Underwater Hockey Zones
<-- Underwater Hockey Formations
Position Alignments In A 3-3 -->
The pool is divided into 3 zones/thirds; defensive, mid and offensive.
Teams move through these zones in a diamond pattern. Move the puck to the wall in the defensive zone, up the middle on the wall and then towards their goal in the offensive zone. Here's an example path the puck might take from one goal to the next:
Defensive Zone
You never want to bring the puck into the shaded red area in the defensive zone. Usually, when a defender brings the puck into this area, it's called "clearing to the goal" and usually results in the other team scoring. All movement should be away from this area into the white areas in the defensive zone. If you want to get rid of the puck, chuck it into a corner or along a side wall, but never throw it over the middle while in the defensive zone!
In the defensive zone you can take the puck towards the corner but you are best served to angle it up the wall quickly before getting stuck in the corner. Keep the puck moving forward and away from the goal. If your team is in trouble, has a penalty, needs to kill the clock (i.e. you have the lead and the clock is winding down), or someone is subbing out then the corner is your friend.
Offensive Zone
In the offensive zone, you do not go into the corners or head for the corners. This is where the other team wants you to be, you need to be swimming towards the goal. A team scores “in the goal” not “on the wall” or “in the corner”.
Your first move/instinct in the offensive zone should be to go towards the goal. Always check towards the goal and steer towards the goal. Don’t get pushed to the corner and don’t ever swim towards a wall or the corner in the offensive zone. If the other team has possession and goes to the corner then the forward on that side needs to get the puck out. The only person who should go into the corner is the forward on that side - otherwise everyone gets out of position and frequent 2 on 1s develop going the other way.
If the puck ends up the corner, don't try to just ram it down the end wall (the wall with the goal) into the goal. The hardest path to the goal is from the corner down the end wall so always try to bring the puck out on a 45 degree angle from the corner, passing to the closest back on your team. The back then has many options for their next move. Assuming the back shoots/passes, all the forwards and another back should follow the shot and make sure it goes into the goal.
The extra players who are not directly involved in play around the goal should position themselves so the other team's defenders can't clear the puck away from the goal. They do by lining up in positions where they can force the play back towards the goal. For example, if a puck battle is occurring right on the lip of goal, but there is no room for the outside forwards, the outside forwards should line up right on the edges of the goal, parallel with the end wall. This way, if a defender ends up getting it clear of the crowd and tries to clear it to the corner, one of the outside forwards can stop the defender, force the puck back to the middle, and possibly score.

IFSC: Aircraft leasing gets a big boost
Around 80 per cent of the total commercial fleet in India is leased against 53 per cent of the same, globally
A low-pressure area formed over the North-West Bay of Bengal and adjoining coastal areas of Bengal on Friday, and a follow-up ‘low’ is forecast to shape up over the same area five days later on August 1.
Under their influence, the monsoon is expected to stay active over Central and adjoining South Peninsular India, Rajasthan and Gujarat during the next five days.
The Climate Prediction Centre of the US National Weather Service has hinted at the possibility of a third ‘low’ forming off the Odisha coast, a little South to where its predecessors formed, between August 8 and 12.
While the first two systems may translate into above-normal rainfall for most parts of the country during the week July 25 to 31, Jammu & Kashmir, Himachal Pradesh, Kerala, South Tamil Nadu and Lakshadweep could be exceptions.
An extended range forecast issued by the India Meteorological Department (IMD) indicated below-normal rainfall for the week on account of the ‘low’ being located ‘too far away to the North-East.’
The week that follows (August 1 to 7) may see the monsoon strengthen further over the central parts of the country, bringing cumulatively above normal rain for most parts of the country.
It would still leave out Jammu & Kashmir, Kerala, South Interior Karnataka, Tamil Nadu and Lakshadweep where the rainfall could end up below normal for a second week.
The APEC Climate Centre based in Busan, South Korea, has reiterated in its latest forecast that the South Peninsula would see normal rain in August, which is normally the second rainiest of the four monsoon months.
Meanwhile, the IMD, in an update on Friday, said that rainfall has increased over Central India, the Northern Plains as well as the adjoining western Himalayan region since Thursday.
The forecast for the next three days says that fairly widespread rainfall with isolated heavy to very heavy falls may lash Odisha, Madhya Pradesh, Chhattisgarh, Vidarbha, the ghats of Madhya Maharashtra, Konkan, Gujarat and Rajasthan. Isolated extremely heavy falls were forecast over East Rajasthan on Friday; over Gujarat on Sunday and Monday; and over Saurashtra & Kutch on Monday and Tuesday.
An extended range forecast said that fairly widespread to widespread rainfall with isolated heavy to very heavy falls are likely over Uttar Pradesh, Jammu & Kashmir, Himachal Pradesh, Uttarakhand and Punjab into the weekend (until Sunday).
However, over Madhya Pradesh and Gujarat, it is likely to continue throughout the week (until Wednesday next). Isolated extremely heavy rainfall is likely to occur over Gujarat on Sunday and Monday and over East Rajasthan on Sunday.
The presence of the ‘low’ would translate into fairly widespread to widespread rainfall with heavy to very heavy rainfall at isolated places over the plains of Bengal, Odisha and Chhattisgarh until Wednesday next.
Widespread rainfall with isolated heavy rainfall is likely along the West Coast until Wednesday. Light/moderate scattered to fairly widespread rainfall is likely to occur over the rest of the country most days of theGetting There
Getting to Bwindi Impenetrable..Cub Cadet SLTX1054
The Cub Cadet SLTX1054 lawnmower is one of the most powerful garden tractors in the 1000 series from Cub Cadet. It has a massive twin cylinder Courage engine that needs it’s oil level to be kept at a consistent 1.9 liters. This engine which has been made by Kohler has a power output of 26 hp which turns the blades on the 54 inch mower deck with ease. The wheels get their power from a hydrostatic transmission that makes the SLTX 1054 an automatic, meaning there is no annoying gear stick that you need to use to change speeds. Instead you just need to either press down on the pedal harder to speed up and ease up on it to slow down. The top speed of this Cub Cadet lawnmower is 8.4 kph (5.2 mph), making it quite nippy when it needs to be. Smaller models than this one include the Cub Cadet LTX1050 tractor lawn mower and the Cub Cadet SLTX1050 ride on lawnmower.
The Cub Cadet SLTX1054 lawn mower tips the scales at 257 kg (567 lbs). This weight is transferred to the ground through large turf tires that prevent large threads from forming one lawns when the SLTX 1054 drives over them. Each rear tire measures 22×9.5 (22 inch diameter, 9.5 inch width) while each front wheel measures in at 16×6.5 (16 inch diameter, 6.5 inch width). Without any attachments the lawnmower measures 1.75 m (69 inches), but this will obviously increase depending on which implements are attached.
Cub Cadet have a long tradition of making quality machines that they are proud to stand behind. The Cub Cadet SLTX1054 is no different and that’s why it comes with a limited guarantee of 5 years or 500 working hours (whichever comes first) to all those purchasing a SLTX 1054.

Have Your Say! Leave A Review Do you love or hate this tractor? You can have your say below by leaving review.
i purchased a sltx1054vt and the trans failes 1 month after warranty….dealer declined repairs… called cub cadet they finally agreed they have trans problems the agreed to furnish trans if i paid labor {my suggestion} only took dealer 2 months to fix i also need to replace spindles every 2 years…mower is serviced and checked over every trip out…don’t know what is worse…dealer that don’t care or poor product
I have had my SLTX1054 for 4 years now and the only thing I have had to do is replace one of the plastic pulleys that the cable for the deck lift rides on. The cable got off of the pulley and grooved it on one side.
I did have to change the deck drive belt after my son ran over a large diameter tree branch and locked up the blades, which smoked the belt. If not for the tree branch thing I believe the belt would have lasted at least a couple more years.
And I bought an extra set of blades and change them out a couple of times each season to keep them sharp.Or if I hit anything like a large tree branch…..
My yard is 3 1/2 acres with a ditch in front. The ditch has a fairly steep angle. Even though you are not supposed to mow on that steep of a hill sideways, I do it and the Cub doesn’t seem to mind.
If you keep the blades sharp it mows through anything. Just like every other mower I have ever had.
I use it to pull a box scraper to grade my driveway which is about 350 feet long.
I also pull a 48 inch roller with no problems.
I put about 3 hrs on it every time I mow.
If I get 15 years out of it with no major issues, I will call it a success.
I hate mine too! AND I will never buy another Cub Cadet product again.
My 2011 Cub Cadet SLTX 1054 was disappointing from day one. Does not cut grass well and you have to go slow. Top speed even without the mower running has always been slow. Trying to bag clippings will drive you nuts.
Purchased from local Dealer. This was the second lawn tractor I purchased from him. (The first one was a Simplicity and it ran 11 years with no problems.) Local Dealer no longer carries Cub Cadet mowers. That should tell you something.
You get what you pay for, but I still feel cheated. At five years and 300 hours it literally fell apart.
I will never buy another Cub Cadet product again.
Hate it will buy a John Deere or a Kubota next. I have never dislike a mower more!! They are all pretty much by MTD now a daysWASHINGTON (Reuters) - Veteran Democratic Senator Russ Feingold is struggling in his bid for re-election in Wisconsin due in part to concerns about his ability to help create jobs, a Reuters-Ipsos poll found on Tuesday.
With three weeks to go until the November 2 congressional elections, the poll found wealthy Republican businessman Ron Johnson leading Feingold by 51 percent to 44 percent among likely voters in Wisconsin.
Feingold, bidding for a fourth six-year term, had long been seen as a safe incumbent but a weak U.S. economy has generated doubts about him and many of President Barack Obama’s Democratic allies.
Wisconsin is one of a dozen crucial races in the fight for control of the Senate, now controlled by Democrats.
Republicans are seen winning a majority in the U.S. House of Representatives from Democrats, but their chances of taking the Senate are slimmer.
After the vote, Obama is likely to face a more hostile Congress in 2011 and struggle to get approval for any climate change and immigrations bills.
A key victory for Republicans would be the Wisconsin seat. Johnson was seen in the poll as being “the best person to help generate jobs in Wisconsin” -- 49 percent compared to 36 percent for Feingold.
By a 42-28 percent margin, Feingold was more likely to be seen as “part of the problem with politics right now in this country,” according to the poll.
“With some of the right messaging and campaigning and higher Democratic turnout than anticipated, Feingold could pull this back down, I suppose, but it’s not looking very good right now,” said Ipsos pollster Julia Clark.
Voters said Feingold’s support for Obama’s healthcare reform this year made little difference to their preference.
Clark said Feingold is likely suffering from an anti-incumbent backlash against Washington.
“I don’t think it’s that he’s seen as incompetent or weak on any particular issue, I think it’s simply that this is a race where there’s a very specific set of circumstances that means incumbency is no good thing,” she said.
In the Wisconsin governor’s race, Republican Scott Walker leads his Democratic opponent, Tom Barrett, by 10 points, 52 percent to 42 percent.
Incumbent Governor Jim Doyle, a Democrat, has relatively weak job approval ratings, with 60 percent disapproving and 34 percent approving his job performance.
Republicans are highly motivated to vote in Wisconsin compared to Democrats, an “enthusiasm gap” that worries Democrats. The poll found 80 percent of Republicans and 60 percent of Democrats “certain” to vote in November.
The Ipsos poll of 600 registered voters, including 451 who said they were likely to vote, was conducted from Friday to Monday. The full survey of registered voters has a margin for error of 4 percentage points while the smaller sample of likely voters has a margin for error of 4.6 points.

Which cast member had to change their name after auditioning?
Getty Images
Karen Grassle (who played Caroline Ingalls) was going by a stage name when she auditioned for the maternal role: Gabriel Tree.
She managed to beat out more than 40 other women for the role, but Michael Landon and the rest of the production team requested that she go back to her birth name while portraying such a traditional, old-school character.
Whose hairstyle frequently caused filming delays?
Getty Images
You might think Nellie's perfectly round curls were to blame for taking too long in the hair and makeup department, but Alison Arngrim actually wore a (sometimes painful) wig throughout most of the series to make things easier. Instead, it was Michael Landon's DIY dye job that caused pauses in filming.
The actor had gone gray in his 20s and relied on a box hair dye to cover up the strands with the brunette color we all remember. However, that solution would backfire when long days filming in the sun caused the shade to fade into a lavender hue. The production staff was eventually able to convince Landon to seek a professional hairstylist to do the job with long-lasting dye.
Which young actress passed out on set?
Getty Images
The costumes were all carefully crafted to fit within the pioneering period the show was set in. For the female cast members, that meant wearing layers of wool. While filming her first episode, which was the second episode of the series, Alison Arngrim became so overheated under the hot California sun that she actually passed out on set.
She wasn't the only one, either — an assistant director who likely wasn't even wearing thick layers also fainted from the heat on that day.
Which actor wore 4-inch lifts?
Getty Images
Ernest Borgnine appeared as a mystical mountain man on the series, but you wouldn't have been able to tell that he and Michael Landon were actually the exact same height. At 5 feet and 9 inches tall and as the patriarch of the series, Landon never wanted to appear shorter than any of the other male actors.
He relied on lifts in his shoes to give him a boost. Of course, his impressive physique also made it easy to believe he could tower over every other man in Walnut Grove.
What were the names of the Ingalls' family dogs?
Getty Images
The shaggy dog who appeared in the first four seasons might not have matched the description of the bulldog Laura Ingalls Wilder detailed in her original writing, but it did share the same name: Jack. Apparently, Michael Landon instantly fell in love with the pup and didn't mind the lack of continuity with the books.
Later on after Jack passed away, the Ingalls got a new black and white dog whom they named Bandit.
Which cast members are surprisingly best friends in real life?
Getty Images
Although they played bitter enemies on screen as Laura Ingalls and Nellie Oleson, Alison Arngrim revealed in her autobiography that she and Melissa Gilbert were actually the best of friends when the cameras stopped rolling.
In her book, Confessions of a Prairie B*tch: How I Survived Nellie Oleson and Learned to Love Being Hated ($16.99, Amazon), Arngrim describes the pair as "partners in crime" when it came to pulling pranks on set. She and Gilbert remain close friends to this day.
What canned stew was used for the family meals?
Getty Images
Anytime the Ingalls sat down to eat a hearty stew served up by Ma, the actors were actually chowing down on Dinty Moore beef stew.
Whenever you saw them enjoying some fried chicken, that was provided by KFC. They also paid homage to the famous chicken franchise with an actor dressed up to look like Colonel Sanders in one of the episodes.
What was Laura's favorite perfume?
Getty Images
You might think the lemon verbena scent Laura received as a gift as an adult came from her husband Manly, but it was actually provided by the Ingalls' family friend, Mr. Edwards.
He gave her the same sweet smelling perfume earlier on in the series when the character was still a young girl, too.
Which couple shared a lot less love behind the scenes?
Getty Images
It wasn't that there was any real animosity between Melissa Gilbert and Dean Butler (who played Manly), but there were several years between them when their characters got married in the show.
The real Laura Ingalls Wilder was 17 when she married her real Almanzo Wilder, but Gilbert was just 15 when she said "I do" on screen with Butler, who was 23. He tried to ease the tension with jokes and singing silly songs, but that only made Gilbert all the more shy. She eventually asked Michael Landon to restrict the couples' displays of affection to hugs and pecks on the cheek.
What was Nellie's full name?
Getty Images
By the end of the series, Nellie is going by her full married name: Nellie Oleson Dalton.
However, if you assumed her first name was just a play on her dad Nels' name, you're apparently mistaken — Nellie was actually a cute nickname for Danielle.
Which young cast members were siblings in real life?
Getty Images
Aside from the twin girls who shared the role of Carrie Ingalls, there were two other sets of siblings in the show's cast: Melissa Gilbert as Laura and her adopted brother Jonathan as Willie Oleson, plus Matthew Labyorteaux as Albert Ingalls and his adopted brother Patrick as Andrew Garvey.
What was the name of Charles' rarely seen sister?
Getty Images
In a flashback scene to Charles' childhood in the season four episode "I Remember I Remember," we meet his sister: Polly.
The brief appearance is the only time we see or even hear her name mentioned throughout the series.Influenster: Reviews & Deals 4+

Influenster is great but I can’t give them 5 stars and here is why. I have 6000 friends and I’ve only received 1 vbox in 2 years. In I just recently received the box after contacting them about it. I have almost 400 reviews, 90 discussion, 120 followers just on Influenster and I am not getting items like I should. They claim also Jason items out based on your area you live in your demographic but I live in one of the most largest cities in the United States so that also makes no sense why I’ve only received one Vbox. They should not be giving one person box after box after box when that person isn’t putting in the work and they definitely should be giving boxes to people that actually help boost their business do the reviews correctly and they’re always on the app! Influenster needs to stop playing favorites and make it equal for everyone else!
I LOVE THIS APP
For people who “hate” on influenster, you’re not using the app correctly. The more time you put into the app the more things you will be sent. Don’t hate on an app that sends you things for free, all they want from you is an honest review and opinion, if you are lazy with your reviews then don’t expect frequent boxes as the best reviewers get the boxes. It’s also important to visit the app frequently and take part in their hashtags. I love influenster, at first they sent me a pro activ set which didn’t really suit my skin but I was still super grateful as I had always wanted to try pro activ and this app allowed me to do that for free. I have recently received my second box which is a shampoo and conditioner set. They’re actually worth $77 on Sephora and so I was sooo grateful when they sent this to me. The set has really helped my hair as it is made for itchy scalps for which I am a sufferer. I will always use and love influenster and I always recommend this app to all my friends as well as my social media following!

Christians need to grow in both the knowledge that science can provide us about God’s world, as well as the reasons why science isn’t the only path to knowledge.
Russ Ramsey’s The Mission of the Body of Christ is graciously available free to Christ and Pop Culture members until October 3, 2018, through our partnership with InterVarsity Press.
Across the spectrum of cultures around the world, story-telling will always remain a practice that connects the human experience. We construct stories every day out of various experiences. We tell stories and write thousands of words about everything from ketchup to sports. It’s how we’re fashioned, because our Maker is a story-teller.
So it only makes sense to write a story about God’s people. Obviously, that story has already been written (the Bible); however, the narrative is not always provided in an easy-to-follow flow. There are verse and chapter numbers that can cause us to pause subconsciously and ponder one particular sentence, distracting us from the overarching story. Those methods are beneficial for biblical and spiritual meditation on God’s Word, but it can become difficult when trying to take into account the full scope and context of the scriptures.The way Ramsey sets up each of Paul’s letters—with characters, place, time, and social conditions—offers a new and captivating way to understand Scripture.
Fortunately, author Russ Ramsey understands these difficulties and has written a helpful story for the Church. Part of the Retelling the Story series, Ramsey writes the story of the early Church as recorded in the book of Acts in his book The Mission of the Body of Christ. It is not an overly complicated narration, as the book is broken up into four parts with easy-to-read chapters of about six to eight pages for each chapter.
In the preface, Ramsey is forthcoming about the way he wrote the book. For example, for many of the events and reactions recorded in Acts, he draws his material from speculation, using his imagination to infer a character’s probable reaction. The benefit of this approach—if you’re concerned about accuracy or wanting to know what’s speculative and what’s factual—is that it will force you to open a Bible and read it for yourself. Although this approach could also become a point of contention (especially when reading with others), hopefully it will instead create robust consideration and conversation around the Word of God.
This book shines in its ability to help the average Christian use his or her imagination. Reading the Bible without context can become confusing, bleak, and dull. But the way Ramsey sets up each of Paul’s letters—with characters, place, time, and social conditions—offers a new and captivating way to understand Scripture. For example, Ramsey restructures Paul’s letter to Philemon so that it can be more easily imagined by modern-day readers:
The servant who answered the door wore a look of disbelief. The last person she expected to find when she heard the knock was Onesimus, who stood there with his traveling companion Tychicus.
Tychicus was the first to speak. “Please tell the master of the house that we come bearing letters from the apostle Paul, who is in Rome. One is for the church that meets in this house. The other is for him personally; it concerns my brother Onesimus here.” (7)
This imaginative approach is one that engages new and long-time Bible readers in a refreshing way. The Mission of the Body of Christ is an invigorating addition to your reading list and would make a great gift for new converts and seasoned saints alike.

Purpose: :
The aim of this study is to know the role of Melatonin, the MT3 agonist 5-MCA-NAT and MT2 agonist IIK7, have in the rate of re-epithelization after corneal wound healing as well as what melatonin receptor is involved in such process.
Methods: :
In wounded SIRC monolayers (establish rabbit corneal epithelial cell line) we studied the estimated migration rate (EMR) and estimated healing time (EHT) after treatment of wounds with melatonin, 5-MCA-NAT and IIK7 100 µM (n = 8). In the presence of melatonin 100 µM, we also assayed the effect the antagonists Luzindole (non-selective), DH97 (MT2) and Prazosin (MT3) (n = 8) had on the migration rate. A control wound was performed in each experiment, this being treated with buffer.
Results: :
When we assayed both melatonin and IIK7 100 µM, the EMR was increased (6.65 ± 0.27 and 8.22 ± 0.39, respectively) in relation to the control (5.61 ± 0.54). This result was in accordance with a decrease in EHT in 5 and 10 hours for melatonin and IIK7, respectively. The MT3 selective agonist 5-MCA-NAT (100 µM) had no effect in migration rate (5.76 ± 0.16). In the presence of melatonin 100 µM, Luzindole 100µM, DH97 100 µM and Prazosin 1 µM produced a reduction in EMR (5.37 ± 1.09, 0.82 ± 0.45 and 2.73 ± 0.37 respectively) with an increase in EHT (9 hours, no apparent healing and 32 hours respectively). In the presence of 5-MCA-NAT 100 µM, DH97 100 µM and Corynanthine 25 µM produced a delay in EMR with an increased in EHT (2.93 ±0.85 and 70 hours for DH97 100 µM and 1.89 ± 0.38 and 60 hours for Corynanthine 25 µM), while Prazosin 1 µM had no effect on EMR (5.20 ± 0.30).
Conclusions: :
The increase of rate that melatonin exerts in corneal epithelial cell migration is due mainly to the activation of a MT2 receptor melatonin receptor.

The Know-how, Arts and Media Program gives two undergraduate packages: a Bachelor of Science in Expertise, Arts and Media (BSTAM) as well as a Minor in Expertise, Arts and Media (MTAM) The philosophy of the TAM Program curriculum is to integrate inventive production, critical considering, and technical expertise into each course. Ricardo was awarded the one-time grant of $300 for demonstrating outstanding talent, creativity and arduous work within the visible or industrial arts. Cornell Cinema features a media study library with intensive reference materials, publications, a movie assortment, and frequent workshops and displays by guest artists and critics.
The programme facilitates two modes of study: inventive follow primarily based audiovisual arts studies and empirical media studies. You may pursue a Bachelor of Arts in the Arts with a Video Production main, or you’ll be able to pursue the Bachelor of the Arts in Journalism with a video production emphasis throughout the Media Research main. Focusing on the Canadian experience in a globalized setting, the ARTM program is also designed to assist the academic and profession goals of exchange and foreign students.
One of the key themes in new media artwork is to create visible views of databases. Study from the consultants in artistic arts and media. PhD students should take part within the PhD seminars all through their research. Our teachers are leaders in their fields and our College is high-ranked nationally in the performing arts, English literary studies, artistic writing, movie research and media.
It is supposed to service those students who’ve an actual interest in managing within the arts and cultural sector. Potential profession paths embrace (but aren’t limited to): curating, journalism, visual and performing arts, tv, music and movie industries; publishing; arts schooling.
Thus although the curriculum is planned to be interdiciplinary we put particular emphasis on themes of audiovisual tradition and modern digital tradition. Opportunities abound for college students to present their work via the division’s Scholar Laboratory Theatre Firm, Dance Program and scholar film screenings, as well as via numerous student organizations on campus.
Our facilities are various, ranging from the one faculty campus dedicated to art, dance, music, and theatre in Missouri to the Rust Center for Media in the coronary heart of downtown Cape Girardeau. A campus since 1998, the Centre for Creative Arts and Media is predicated in a former Redemptorist Monastery, which initially opened in 1940 to accommodate college students training for the priesthood.The Navy recently validated a software fix for the Electromagnetic Aircraft Launch System, despite negative comments about the program from President Trump.
Following a review in April 2014 of aircraft instrumentation data, a problem was discovered after testing. The testers found holdback release dynamics exceeded current fleet allowances during launches of these aircraft configured with wing-mounted external fuel tanks.
"We were confident since the day that the issue was uncovered that it was solvable," EMALS integrated program team lead George Sulich said in a July 24 statement.
The final step of testing the fix with instrumented aircraft launches was delayed a year because of competing test priorities, according to a service statement.
"The subsequent software will be incorporated on board CVN-78 to support shipboard launches of F/A-18s with EFTs in 2019, following the ship's Post Shakedown Availability," the statement reads.
EMALS is a launching system that uses a moving electromagnetic field to propel aircraft to launch speed, and is one of the many new technologies planned for the Navy's Ford-class aircraft carrier fleet.
EMALS came under scrutiny after President Trump told Time magazine that while he was aboard the Ford during a March visit he received a negative report on the system.
"Ah, how is it working?" Trump said he asked of the new system, which uses electromagnetics, rather than steam, to propel aircraft from the ship. The reply from an unidentified person, according to Trump: '"Sir, not good. Not good. Doesn't have the power. You know the steam is just brutal. You see that sucker going and steam's going all over the place, there's planes thrown in the air.'"
"It sounded bad to me," Trump told Time. ."
But according to Navy budget documents, the service plans to spend $579.8 million in FY-18 to put EMALS on the John F. Kennedy (CVN-79).
"Benefits over the current C13 steam catapults include reduced weight and volume, greater launching flexibility for future aircraft, improved control, and reduced manning workload requirements," the documents note.
The service found EMALS would reduce both the number of maintenance requirements and size of the crew on the carrier, according to the Navy.
The Gerald R. Ford (CVN-78) is the first aircraft carrier outifitted with EMALS. The ship was commissioned July 22.I was reminded about these 'art vending machines' I read about ages ago.

They say imitation is the most sincere form of flattery... but is this taking it too far???This week, Ray Mears was in the Flow Country – a vast space (15,000 square miles) of nothing but bog – well almost, but we’ll come to that. The Flow has a rather special place in the lives of Chris, my husband, and me. About a dozen years ago, when we first came up to the far north of Scotland with the thought of maybe moving up here, we were staying in Tain on the east side of the country, not all that far from Inverness. I had been thinking that it was all very nice and we had looked at a couple of nice houses with pleasant views, but I was wondering whether it would be such a big improvement on where we were in Lincolnshire – especially as it would involve a heck of a big move. When I mentioned this to Chris, it turned out that he was of much the same mind.
Then we went over into the Flow country and all that changed in an instant! The countryside was so very wild and bleak – just how we like it! – and the lochs and lochans were a deep dark black due to some sort of condition of the weather on that particular day – we have seen them also looking very benign and blue. We both looked at the country and then looked at each other and agreed that this was where we wanted to live – and the rest is history!
The Flow is a very special place; there can be no doubt of that. I was surprised to hear from Ray Mears that it is the largest area of blanket bog in Europe – I always assumed that there must be a much bigger area somewhere in Russia – and maybe there is. Not everyone considers Russia to be part of Europe, although I always have – at least the “European” part of Russia. But there again, I could be entirely wrong and in fact the Flow is the largest in Europe whether you count Russia or not! Whatever, it is certainly a unique place, with its miles and miles of bog…
As Ray pointed out in passing though, there are patches of trees. I remember the horror that pervaded the country in the 1970s when it was revealed that there had been a concerted effort to plant conifers in the Flow country and that certain high-earning celebrities had taken advantage of tax breaks to invest in this desecration. In their defence, I doubt they had ever been to the Flow and I’m sure no-one would have mentioned to them what an ecologically sensitive place it is – even if people were even aware of that at the time! In a way, too, the fact that celebrities were involved brought everything to the public eye and the outcry was enough that the planting stopped. At least, that is how I remember it… Now, 30 and more years and very little growth in the trees later, they are all coming down – not just on RSPB land, but generally. Of course, it is going to take a heck of a long time to take all the trees away, and even longer for nature to repair the damage.
One of the factors which may have influenced the decision to remove the trees could have been the discovery that fir trees planted in bog give out carbon dioxide on a continual basis – rather than just during the day as trees not planted in bog would do. So not only have the trees destroyed – or almost – one of the biggest conservers of carbon dioxide – i.e. the peat bog itself – but added to the problem of global warming just by being there sending out tons of carbon dioxide on an ongoing basis! Of course, nothing of this was appreciated at the time – but I for one am heartily glad the trees are going.
Ray was especially interested in the wildlife which lives in the Flow. Well, in our minds, precious little actually lives there! Here in Assynt just a few miles further west, we have lots and lots and lots more… We have the deer of course – in fact red deer are commonplace here, with roe and sika not so easily seen but still around, although we don’t have fallow deer. The plover the camera was so intent on are almost as common as muck on the foreshore here, and hen harriers are certainly to be seen, although not so frequently as buzzards or even golden eagles – one of which I saw the other day soaring over the hills around Knockan Craig. Of course, Ray’s programme was only half an hour in length and there wouldn’t have been time even to touch on the wildlife we have around here! This part of the world is a genuine paradise for anyone even remotely interested in nature.
I couldn’t help thinking when watching the programme that it was a good job that it was filmed in summer – at this time of year there would have been very little chance of being able to make such a film as it would have been far too wet! I love bogs in principle, but they also worry me. A few years ago, on a lovely crisp winter’s day, our older son fell into a bog. Luckily, he had a) double knotted his shoes otherwise he would have lost them for sure and b) he is a strong young man and was able to extricate himself quite quickly. Even so he was very wet and by the time we got home, suffering from a mild hyperthermia. Around the same time, the father of a neighbour also went into the bog. He had lived in the area for 30 years, but bogs shift about the place and when out walking his dog, he mistook what he thought should have been solid ground. He was stuck for four hours and eventually a helicopter got him out and flew him straight to hospital where it was touch and go whether he would live. It is not just high mountains that can be dangerous up here…! At any time of year, I don’t think I would be very keen on leaving the road while crossing the Flow country.
As you might have guessed, I do love the Flow. At least once a year, Chris and I try to head up to the north coast and then take the road along from Durness, turning right at Hope just beyond Loch Eriboll, to take the road across the Flow to Altnaharra, a single track road which runs along the foot of Ben Hope. It’s not a terribly much used road and passing places are a bit few and far between. Way out in the middle of the Flow country, there stands the most remote pub in the UK – Ray was absolutely right when he said that the area is not very populated… Altnaharra – noteworthy for its weather station – is effectively on the southern edge of the Flow, and there we go south and east through Lairg and thence west, home to Lochinver. It is quite a long day, but we very much enjoy it – taking our time and stopping every so often just to enjoy the landscape.
This whole part of the country – the North West Highlands and across the Flow which runs eastwards from here – is extremely valuable and sensitive ecologically, both at the coastline and inland. Here in Assynt, we basically have an oceanic climate – although climate change may be altering this. It means that we get a lot of rain but generally not much frost or snow, which means in turn that we have species of plants, especially bryophytes and fungi, which are globally rare but proliferate here. It all makes for an amazing place to live, or visit, and one which needs to be treasured for the future and not exploited. Of course, it is constantly under threat from this and that – often schemes with the best intentions, as had the fir trees were when they were planted in the Flow.

The Hass avocado has dark green, bumpy skin which turns black as it ripens. The creamy, inner flesh is delicious in salads or guacamole. Hass is the variety most widely found at your supermarket as it accounts for 80% of all commercially-grown avocados.

Hass Avocado Tree is self-fertile, but the fruit crop will be larger if the tree is planted with a second tree.
Persea americana 'Hass'
The Hass avocado is the standard by which all other Avocados are judged. The classic dark green, bumpy skin turns black as it ripens. The creamy, inner flesh is delicious sliced on sandwiches, cut into salads or making the finest guacamole, which is the hallmark of this culinary delight. It is said that over 80% of all commercially grown Avocados are the Hass. Not as cold hardy as other avocados but more and more showing up in the more protected colder areas of zone 9. the Hass is an A type flower but in colder climates is often self-fruitful. it is always a good idea to pair up a B type flowering Avocado like Bacon or Fuerte just for insurance sake.
Avocados were once popular hedge plants and can be planted quite close. Recommended is 8 to 10 feet on center
Avocados were once popular hedge plants and can be planted quite close. Recommended is 8 to 10 feet on center
Avocados can benefit from being planted close to a building in the colder climates to take advantage of the radiant heat
Avocados like fast-draining organic soil. Avocado trees prefer full sun, but young trees need some protection from hot afternoon sun until they develop dense foliage. Water avocados on a regular basis during warm seasons. Avocados do not like cold damp soil and can easily develop root rot if they remain wet for long periods. If poor drainage is suspected plant on a mound or raised bed 12 to 24 inches tall. They are also sensitive to cold and may require protection from frost. Avocados are often alternate bearing, and the fruit crop will be larger if the tree is planted with a second avocado tree. Avocados can get to be quite tall but can be held to below 10 feet with summer pruning.The Republic of Uzbekistan

DISCLAIMER:This page is for informational purposes and while certain principals may be universal there are a number of variables at play. Nothing about reading this page creates and attorney/client relationship and is not advice for your specific case.
So you have been sued for a debt collection matter. This might be for a credit card debt, a post repossession deficiency, and in some cases for medical debt. This may have been brought by the original creditor or a debt buyer.
First of all you have made the right choice by seeking legal representation. One of the collection firms I frequently litigate against keeps records of their cases and they state that about 1.5% of the people that they sue hire an attorney that in their opinion knows what they are doing.
Time is of the essence. Depending on what court the lawsuit has been brought in you may have as few as 14 days to file a written response. This needs to be done by a professional.
People are often scared and or embarrassed when they are sued. As such they often feel the need to explain themselves or even apologize when they call. Forgive me if I seem to cut you off and start asking questions. It’s not that I am unsympathetic but please know that whatever brought you too me your circumstances are not unique, and frankly those factors rarely factor in to how a case plays out.
I need to know four or five basic pieces of information:
1. Who is the named Plaintiff?
This may have been a best buy account through Citibank but now someone like Midland Funding or Portfolio Recovery owns it. It may be a totally different analysis
2. What court are we in?
In Tarrant County alone there are 8 Justice of Peace Courts, 3 County Courts at law and 10 Civil District Courts. That’s 21 different Judge’s personalities, sets of procedures, and interpretations of the relevant case law.
3. Who are the lawyers?
There is usually a signature black on the last page of the petition. There are sometimes 2 or 3 different sets of lawyers who may represent a particular creditor. A Midland Funding or Portfolio Recovery Associates account with the in-house lawyers will have a different personality (And different settlement parameters) than one with Scott & Associates PC or Rausch Sturm.
What are my options?
While there are a number of factors to be considered here there are basically 3 options:
1. Settle 2. Fight 3. File Bankruptcy
Different levels of courts have different rules or standards of evidence. I’ve argued in most of the local courts and against most of the major players on the collection side. I have a good idea of what to expect in most of the courts in the area and I have a rapport with most of the collection attorneys in the area. The collectors have the burden of proof and there are potentially a number of legal and factual impediments to proving their case. I can help you evaluate whether or not a trial on merits is a good option.
No one wants to talk about the B word but if you have more than about $20,000.00 in unsecured debt than this is probably a conversation that we need to have.

by Ulrika Lomas, Tax-News.com, Brussels
13 December 2007
After years of difficult negotiations, Peter Mandelson, EU Trade Commissioner, has finally secured adoption of a ruling which will bring into effect a set of Economic Partnership Agreements with ACP member countries giving them free access to the member states of the the EU for their goods exports in return for opening their own markets to the EU after transition periods of up to 25 years.
The EU has been offering the ACP countries the EPAs to replace the trade chapters of the 2000 Cotonou Agreement between the EU and the ACP countries, whose exemption from WTO rules will expire at the end of 2007 after it was attacked by other countries outside the Cotonou agreement, alleging ex-colonial preference.
The 78 ACP countries fall into three groups: those who have accepted the EPAs, and are covered by this week's ruling - 15 of those; those which are still refusing to accept the EPAs - 27 of those, and if they don't sign up by 31st December they will find themselves back in the old 'GSP' regime as of January, with quite high tariffs imposed on many of their key exports; and the remainder, who are so poor that they are covered by unilateral EU concessions - to them, the EPAs are irrelevant.
At this stage the EPAs only cover trade in goods; negotiations on services have been postponed until 2008.
Peter Mandelson faced heavy criticism at last weekend's EU/Africa summit from some African leaders, including Thabo Mbeki and Senegalese president Abdoulaye Wade. "Both of them have absolutely nothing to lose," he hit back. "If all of Africa has rejected EPAs, why are we getting people signing?" he asked.
In a statement from Brussels on Tuesday, Mandelson summed up the situation as follows:
"In East Africa we have a region-wide interim agreement including market access deals with all the non-LDCs in the region. Many LDCs - despite the fact they already benefit from 100% access under EBA - are keen to come on board and, progressively, are doing so. Madagascar today, Malawi too, Zambia ready, all with proper market access offers.
"In the Pacific, we have an interim-agreement with the two countries responsible for almost all the trade with the EU - Papua New Guinea and Fiji. I expect to enlarge this to a full regional agreement in 2008.
"In Southern Africa, we have an agreement with Botswana, Lesotho, Swaziland and Mozambique. Angola, ambitious in its market access offer, will I believe join shortly. South Africa is staying out for now and already has its preferential trade agreement with the EU. We are making progress with Namibia and I think it will be possible to find a way through very soon.
"In West Africa, the position of Nigeria has made a regional agreement impossible in the short-term. So we have sought to secure the position of those who are most exposed. Ivory Coast signed an interim agreement on Friday. Our discussions with Ghana confirm that we expect to reach an agreement soon.
"In Central Africa, a regional agreement is also not possible in the short-term. So we must secure the position of the two who stand to lose out. Our teams have been there over the past two weeks. We hope to have agreements with Cameroon and Gabon, the other major non-LDC with whom we are also in touch, in the coming days.
"In the Caribbean, following an intense negotiating drive, then a month without movement, I believe the region now wishes to move ahead. Our senior negotiators will meet them this week in order to seek to complete negotiations before the end of the week."
For the last year, Mandelson has been doing his best to parlay the conflicting interests of the ACP countries, the EU member states, the WTO's 'Aid for Trade' program and the quarrelsome European Parliament into a coherent developing country strategy. But reaching an agreement between all of these competing factions proved to be something of a sisyphean task for Mandelson, despite the looming deadline. The ACP countries want to retain preferential access to the EU for products such as sugar and bananas, plus they want more development aid, but they don't want to liberalize their own tariff barriers; the WTO wants an end to all preferential arrangements; the EU member states want to protect their old colonies, but not to spend any more money on »Marketing Analysis Manager - Strategy & Insight

But it is complicated to know how to tell Partner they fat because asking about weight for many people is a very delicate and sensitive subject.
Being overweight is directly related to physical appearance; it is also associated with overall health.
Why it is Important to Tell your Partner that they Fat
Obesity is an illness. According to the US National Institutes of Health, obesity and being overweight are the second leading cause of preventable death in the US.
There are approximately 300,000 deaths attributed to causes related to being overweight each year.
Note the keywords that we are used overweight, preventable, and death. If your loved one suffers because you don’t want to hurt their feelings, you will lament it. But then it may be too late.
Here we give a beneficial aspect of telling your partner that they need to lose weight. If you don’t know how to tell Partner they fat. It means that they are not close enough to be honest with each other.
How to tell Partner they Fat
Talk about Eating a Healthy Diet
Weight problems are directly related to the type and quantity of food/drink eaten. The conversation can be complicated if this person is your long-term Partner.
If you notice that your Partner’s Health, stamina, or self-esteem is declining due to their weight, it may be time to discuss it.
Just make sure the conversation starts with concern for your Partner’s Health and happiness and not your insecurities. You should also help your Partner by living a healthy lifestyle with her/him.
Assess the Need to Discuss Weight
If your Partner stays within a healthy weight range and only gains a couple of pounds, there’s no need to bring it up. Also, some medications and hormonal changes (for example, hormonal changes in pregnancy) can cause weight changes over which your Partner has not in control.
If your Partner is gaining an unhealthy weight for a reason that is in their control, it might justify a discussion about your health and happiness.
If your partner is within the normal weight range, encourage healthy eating and fitness, but don’t force her to lose more weight. Instead, aim for maintaining good habits as a lifestyle approach to health.
Tell your partner that you are Bothered about their Health
If your Partner’s weight seems unhealthy for you, you may decide that it needs to be discussed. Once you bring up the conversation, make it clear to your partner that you are concerned about their health and happiness.
Mention what you both enjoy and how those things would be affected if your Partner’s Health took a hit.
Invite your Partner to Exercise
Exercise outdoors or at the gym by walking, jogging, or playing another sport. You can also consider team sports leagues in your area if you and your Partner prefer a more social exercise routine. Present your favorite exercise routine to your Partner, she may like it as much as you do.
discuss your opinion in perspective
Your Partner may know that their clothes don’t fit the way they used to, but they may not treat the problem as seriously as you do.
It could be a wake-up call to your Partner that you see this as a significant health concern. Be careful not to embarrass your Partner when you raise your concerns.
Use Empathy
Tell your partner that you love them just the way they are. Tell them that you are trying to talk to them because you want them to live the happiest and healthiest life.
Try to think of an area in your own life where you are especially sensitive; Maybe it’s your education, how you spend your money, or your complicated relationships.
How would you like someone to approach you on such a sensitive and painful subject? When you talk, offer lots of love and relief. Talking to your Partner without true empathy and compassion for their struggle will only push you away.
Conclusion
The overweight problem is not a joke. It may seem cruel and intentional, but a person’s health is a serious matter, and it can be detrimental, and in some cases, it’s essential for your Partner’s Health. In cases where you are morbidly obese, it could even save your life.
According to certified health trainers, many people thought that weight is a way of avoiding rejection from your Partner and getting too close. It is often a way to protect themselves from criticism from their Partner.Sunglasses

Though it was hard work, it certainly made a big impression on me!
While I have not been as involved in politics as I was when I was young, I have always found the political process exhilarating. I was especially excited to learn of Yeah Samake (pronounced ‘Yay Suh ma key’), 42, a Mormon and BYU alumnus, who is currently a top presidential candidate in the African nation of Mali.
Although the democratic election was delayed last year due to extremist activity, Yeah’s faith and Western education have given him a unique perspective on how to protect and improve his impoverished country.
Yeah Samake, the 8th of 18 children, was born into extreme poverty and recalls how his mother would “tie her handkerchief around us to quiet our stomachs.” In spite of their indigent circumstances, his father insisted that all of the children receive an education to avoid illiteracy and to break the cycle of poverty. Though only 15 percent of children attended school in his country, Yeah’s father made great sacrifices so the children could be educated.
“When I was growing up, it was hard to survive,” Yeah recalls. “Forty-five percent of Malian children would die from malaria, diarrhea, and preventable diseases. We knew the challenges of staying well, but we believed in our father’s wise resolve to have us educated. He is a hero to me, and any sacrifices were worth it.”
Though he received a bachelor’s degree in teaching English as a second language, he had no luck finding a job and decided to work as a volunteer teacher in his village, Ouelessebougou (pronounced “O less uh boo goo,”) for the next three years. He found our faith during his work as a linguistic and cultural guide for the Peace Corps and Ouelessebougou Alliance when he met a Mormon couple from Colorado. Jeff and Gretchen Winston were impressed with his work and sponsored him to come to the United States to further his education. He attended BYU from 2000 to 2004, where he earned a master’s degree in public policy. While at BYU, he met his wife, Marissa Coutinho, from India and completed an internship at the United Nations.
Following his Western education, Yeah returned to his hometown where he was elected as mayor, gaining the people’s trust to pay their taxes, which in turn improved living conditions. According to Max Mueller’s book, The Other Mormon Candidate, “by 2009, Ouelessebougou was ranked 699 out of 703 communes (groupings of tribal villages) in Mali for governmental management and transparency. Two years into Yeah’s tenure as mayor, the city rank(ed) in the top 10 in the country, with a tax collection rate of 68 percent.”
If Yeah Samake wins the presidential election in Mali, he will be the first Mormon head of state in the world. Courtesy the Yeah Samake 2012 campaign.
While our Church is politically neutral, we are encouraged to seek out and vote for candidates like Yeah Samake who strive to serve the public good and represent their constituents well.
“As citizens we have the privilege and duty of electing office holders and influencing public policy,” President Thomas S. Monson, and his two counselors wrote to all members in a September 2008 letter. “Participation in the political process affects our communities and nation today and in the future. Latter-day Saints as citizens are to seek out and then uphold leaders who will act with integrity and are wise, good, and honest.”
Many feel that Yeah Samake is such a man. With success at the local level, Yeah plans to carry those successes to the national level. Though he does not use his faith to progress his political career, it has influenced his ideas for organization and communication. Much of his plan is modeled after the Church’s Elder’s Quorum (men’s organization) which uses a chain-of-command type of communication and responsibility. Yeah’s vision is to instill that model between “key players” to keep the government running seamlessly. He believes in accountability and an assurance that politicians are doing what is expected of them.
From all I know of Yeah Samake, I can’t help but admire his endeavors just as I always admired my dad’s. Whether Mormon or not, it is people like Yeah Samake and my dad that are my heroes as they constantly stand for what is right, especially when it is difficult. While my dad is retired from his political activity, I can only wish Yeah Samake the very best as he works to heal the wounds of his broken country.It doesn’t take a Ph.D. to point out that entertainment doesn’t always imitate life.
Just as one might argue Bravo paints housewives the world over as, well, prickly, HGTV can make realty agents, contractors and interior designers look like time-defying, cost-erasing wizards, capable of finding cheap homes and cranking out remodels lickety-split.
Need to know if the remodel will add value to your home – contact the appraisers at for your home value questions.
So we passed them the mic. Here are the myths real estate and design experts encounter, and the truths homebuyers and sellers should keep in mind.
Pray for patience, and put away the hard hat.
A 5-year-old can do the math: It takes longer than approximately 40 minutes to find, renovate and decorate a house. But some consumers do believe a bathroom or kitchen remodel can be carried out in a fantastically quick timespan.
David Roberts, owner of Roberts Architects and Construction in Evanston, has heard prospective clients sing this tune: “Well, a bathroom remodel might take a week, because when we see it on TV, you know, the carpenter shows up, they take the old stuff out, the tile guy comes the next day, he puts the new tile in, and then the next day the plumber comes in and hooks up the toilet and the lovely new sink and shower, and then we put some glass doors in the shower and some light fixtures and by Friday it’s all done.”
That simply ain’t so.
An extensive bathroom remodel, Roberts said, one where you toss the old tiles, tear out the tub, install a shower and rework the plumbing, can take six weeks to eight weeks. Involved kitchen remodels — moving the sink to the island, resizing windows, rearranging appliances — also take a couple of months.

Malaysian Airlines flight MH370
Malaysian Airlines confirmed that flight MH370 had been carrying 5400 lbs of highly flammable lithium ion batteries in its cargo hold, re-igniting speculation that a fire may have caused its disappearance. The admission by CEO Ahmad January comes four days after he denied the aircraft was carrying any dangerous items.
He said the authorities were investigating the cargo, but did not regard the batteries as hazardous - despite the law dictating they are classed as such. The revelation has thrown the spotlight back on the theory that the Boeing 777 may have been overcome by a fire, rendering the crew and passengers unconscious after inhaling toxic fumes.
The plane's full cargo manifest shows that NNR Global shipped 133 pieces of one item weighing 1.99 tons and 67 pieces of another item weighing 463kg for a total weight of 2.453 tons. Neither the number of batteries nor its weight was specified.
· Lithium-ion batteries have caused 140 mid-air incidents in the last 20 years. There is a second mystery in that there was an undisclosed two tons of cargo not on the manifest? The batteries are commonly used in mobile phones and laptops. They are classed as dangerous by The International Civil Aviation Organization.
Aviation expert said it re-affirms belief that flames started in cargo hold.

The F-35 Joint Strike Fighter… is not, in fact, stealthy
 stealth radar system" – unveiled at an air show last August – that is able to "track small targets once the VHF radar has detected them."The Air Force reports "Initial results with the new increment of Block 2B software indicate deficiencies still exist in fusion, radar, electronic warfare, navigation, electro-optical target system, distributed aperture system, helmet-mounted display system, and datalink." Each F-35 fighter jet is valued at $238 million.
The F-35 has not been equipped with "onboard jamming."
Fatal flaws within the cockpit of the US military's most expensive fighter jet ever are causing further problems with the Pentagon's dubious F-35 program. Joint Chiefs of Staff, the Pentagon official cautions that even training missions cannot be safely performed on board the aircraft at this time.
Pilots claim, "The head rest is too large and will impede aft [rear] visibility and survivability during surface and air engagements," "Aft visibility will get the pilot gunned [down] every time" in dogfights, remarked another. A routine inspection on a test plane at Edwards Air Force Base turned up cracked turbine blade.
The 25-page report, scheduled to be delivered to Congress this week, provided a disturbing glimpse of the aircraft's Block 2B software, which is currently not performing at the level of earlier expectations and could significantly delay deployment of the plane. Thanks to

And as masked Russian troops continued to occupy the key gas-pipe region of Crimea, Ukraine's new prime minister claimed: "We are on the brink of disaster."

Earth-sized planet found in 'habitable zone'
Washington - on Thursday in the US journal Science.
The exoplanet, located some 500 light years from Earth, orbits in what is seen as the sweet spot around its star: Not too close and not too far, so it could have liquid water, considered a crucial component to hosting life.
"What makes this finding particularly compelling is that this Earth-sized planet, one of five orbiting this star, which is cooler than the Sun, resides in a temperate region where water could exist in liquid form," said Elisa Quintana of the Seti Institute author of the Science article. Kepler-186f is the fifth and outermost planet orbiting the Kepler-186 star, on the far edge of that solar system's habitable zone.
"However, it is also slightly larger than the Earth, and so the hope would be that this would result in a thicker atmosphere that would provide extra insulation," explained astronomer Stephen Kane.

Sightings in the United States
Alabama
Slocomb -- Since first spotting the flying objects in late dusk on April 30, 2014, I went out in front yard to see them every night unless raining and cloudy. When I first noticed the objects, thought it was stars until I started taking photos of the objects.
That is when I realized it was not stars that I was taking picture of. They are present every night from dusk to dawn. Thanks to MUFON CMS
Arizona Bright Object
Kingman -- I was outside smoking a cigarette, on April 24, 2014 time was about 7:30-8:00 pm at night it was still light outside so the sky was still light clear blue and all you could see is the blue sky. I felt this strange sensation of looking up into the sky and in the meantime I observed this really bright object that seemed very out of place since I'm very familiar with the sky and star location it seemed a bit odd but as I was about to come in I noticed a lot of little small like flashing orbs ejecting or coming in to close range of that brighter object, so I if that was not strange enough lots of more orbs coming in from the SE direction started coming in to close range of this much bigger object.
So of course ran in grabbed my binoculars and camera trying to see what was this strange object ejecting little like bright orbs that were flying in all directions, some stopping and some continued in a path but dimming the lights. It flew very oddly, stopping, making sharp turns. I really got scared when I started taking pictures. It came in for a closer look dimming its lights.
On April 23, 2014 at around 4:20 am, I looked outside my bedroom window and there was a cigar shaped object 12 feet off the ground. Thanks to MUFON CMS
California Lights
San Francisco -- At 6:25 Am on April 30, 2014 as I stood outside the Transamerica Tower, looking toward the Pacific Ocean, I saw a magnificent spaceship. It looked large, like the size of a Moon--shining with an extraterrestrial ring around it, much like Planet Saturn. However, it was Chakra Orange, with a glowing orb inside of it which had a metallic hue to it. It was solid in appearance and had a white aura around it which gave the appearance of vibration. It was facing north toward Pier 39. I still couldn't believe what I was seeing and it stole my breath away. Even after watching it for what felt like ages, I still questioned what I was seeing and this time, when I looked ahead the ship was gone. I speak telepathically with extraterrestrials that have shown themselves to me in the physical world. Andrew the extraterrestrial confirmed it was indeed a UFO. It was a light metallic with a glowing center which looked solid, and an Orange Sacral Chakra glow.
Santa Cruz -- I went outside to take the garbage out on May 2, 2014, and saw a pulsing light in the sky. I got my binoculars and a smart phone and observed distinct white, blue and red lights, sometimes together, sometimes alone. I watched for an hour and half before it silently left.
The second night I saw the same set of pulsing lights hovering in the same location in sky that eventually faded from site going away from us? Two friends also witnessed the same pulsating lights hovering in the sky and got some nice pictures. A triangular light with surrounding lights was marking its shape for 1/2 an hour. Thanks to MUFON CMS
Florida Bright Lights
Tallahassee -- We were driving down Bullheadly Road at about 9 pm on April 30, 2014, when I saw two bright lights, brighter and different from any airplane lights I've seen. I told the driver to follow so we could see what it was. As we got closer near Lake Iamonia we noticed it was hovering. We went to the lake front and parked and saw it was hovering at the center of the lake.
It was hovering about 200 feet up with two main bright lights on its wings and a smaller white light on the front. We watched for 5 minutes and took its picture and the flash attracted it and it started coming toward us. It made a quiet droning noise, as it flew over us with two wings on the side of it. It was a sharp equilateral triangle with small red lights. It gradually sped faster and went out into the distance. Thanks to MUFON CMS
Georgia Orbs
Atlanta -- This photo was sent to me shortly after 3 pm on April 30, 2014. It is a very bizarre cloud-like structure.
I have been chief meteorologist for WSB-TV in Atlanta for more than 30 years and have never seen anything like it.

Illinois Light
Chicago Midway -- My friend and I spotted a strange light or star like in the sky towards the west just a bit above the horizon. It was three fists high off the horizon.
This event took place on the evening of Thursday April 30 2014 at exactly 8:44 pm. I used my tripod with my iPhone with an app called ProCamera. We were outside for at least about 15 to 20 minutes smoking.
Both of us are into stargazing astronomy with the Chicago Astronomical Society, and we are just beginners and we are learning about the stars and planets of the nighttime sky. Also during this event, I had called our IL MUFON investigator Jim Wolford and sent him my photo and video. Thanks to MUFON CMS
Kansas Triangle
Wichita -- An amateur photographer captured a mysterious triangle-shaped craft on April 15, 2014, which bears a striking resemblance to the one seen flying over Amarillo, Texas, earlier this year. In an interview with KSN, Jeff Templin recalled the day the flying object caught his eye. "Anyone that was looking up would have seen it," he told the TV station, noting that it was performing several 180 degree turns in the sky in the shape of an S. Aviation experts have been unable to identify the craft. Watch the news story...
Kentucky Triangle
Louisville – On May 1st 2014, three blinking lights were seen on a triangle shaped object with a red light in the middle with white lights on the edge at 2:22 am. It was flying soundless over the tree tops. Thanks to John Hayes
Michigan Light
St Joseph -- I was out in the front yard in about 5:35 PM on August 2, 2013 and it had just gotten dark and I noticed that a small slow moving object was traveling across the sky. It didn't appear like any aircraft that I could identify so I figured I would take a picture and then see if there is any Internet traffic that stated that other people had seen the same craft.
The craft was an oval or disc shaped made no sound and traveled extremely slowly and in a straight-line path. It was far away and my picture isn't very good. It appears very small and is located just over the power lines in the center of the picture. Thanks to MUFON CMS
Nevada Row of Bright Lights
Las Vegas – The witness saw an extremely bright light low in the sky moving east direction slowly on April 30, 2014 at 9:10 PM. Within seconds the single light became a row of six or eight identical bright lights. We pulled over to study the lights and they vanished. The objects appeared to be "ten times bigger than a star and reported that they seemed to have a yellow ring around them. Thanks to Peter Davenport Director
New Jersey Round Glow
Vernon -- I was at a music fest admiring the moon and the huge halo around it and noticed something come up from behind the mountains on April 12, 2014. It was the opposite direction of planes usual paths and had an upward arched curve from the moment it started. It flew up to and past the moon and up until out of sight. It was round and seemed to glow and had a steady fairly slow and even ascension. It appeared to be bluish. It left behind a very distinct 'chemtrail'. Thanks to MUFON CMS
North Carolina Light
Mecklenburg Nuclear Plant -- UFOs that visit nuclear plants are usually there to look them over, much like an UN inspector might go over the plant for leaks, cracks, and other safety issues.
Aliens are very interested in nuclear power and how we deal with the dangers of that radioactive source. Their technology can detect cracks, glitches in computer programs and other possible systems that could fail and cause a disaster. They are not there to fix them. Fox 46 Carolinas News Source:.
Oklahoma Four Lights
Midwest City -- First observed what looked to be an odd-colored star to the west, when suddenly it fell straight down on May 2, 2014. Went inside and when I came back out there were two more yellow-orange glowing lights coming quickly from the north, heading south towards the area the first object had fallen. Once they reached that location the second light made an abrupt 90 degree turn and fell towards the ground. Before the third object made the same turn towards the ground a fourth object was observed moving much faster, almost as if it were trying to intercept the two. The third object started to descend but its light went out before dropping below the tree line. All the objects were slightly higher than the rooftops. Thanks to MUFON CMS
Utah Oval
Salt Lake City -- Was taking pictures of the sky outside of my house when I looked at the pictures the object was only in one of the pictures nothing before nothing after don't know what the object could be but it was very strange. Thanks to MUFON CMS
Worldwide UFO Reports
Australia Fire
Australind near Bunbury Western Australia -- Looking west towards the Indian Ocean I saw the sky light up thinking it was a meteorite due the sparks and fire on April 21st 2014, at 6:45 PM. As the flash finished there was a craft at that spot whose lights were not the right colors for a normal aircraft, it began travelling north for about 5 seconds before disappearing and then reappearing 20 km's further north.
Alice River, Townsville, Queensland – The dogs barked and woke me up at 4:15 AM on April 27th 2014. I could see it sitting low through the window. I ran and woke my daughter and we saw a stingray with the tail and it was bright orange. It came up from the south over the trees and was really low as it flew over us. It was a good 15 minutes before it headed west.
Broadbeach, Gold Coast, Queensland -- We were out fishing close to midnight on April 29th 2014, when we saw a blue light, like a beach ball? It shot up over Broadbeach at 11:30 PM, and flew over the water at about 1000 feet, changed to red, blue, with a ring of light around it. It changed to blue then red and flew higher. Thanks to John Hayes
Eagleby, Queensland – We saw a round bright light like a high beam head light and my husband flashed the torch at it as it faded on April 27th 2014 at 4:14 am.
It seemed to brighten back up and come closer to us. In the video view finder it flashed red, blue, green, and yellow. When it faded my husband flashed his torch as it continued to return bigger and brighter. I was able to capture video footage of the silent object.
Please note there is one instance of swearing in the video below.Video at
Canada Triangular and Steady Light
Hamilton Mountain, Ontario – They were flying too high and way too fast but looked round on April 19th 2014, at 10:28 PM. It wasn't the space station, that we saw 12 minutes before this. Four of us saw this ufo after my daughter pointed it that was visible for about 15-20 seconds before it quickly vanished.
Downsview, Toronto -- My son, his grandmother and my sister decided to go to York University's Observatory to view the stars April 23rd 2014, at 10:35 PM, as we were leaving, my Mom said "What is that? Four of us saw six flat but roundish "objects" flying low and silent perfect unison. They were illuminated from underneath and in 20 seconds they were gone.
Newmarket, Ontario -- Looking up at the sky in the hot tub I noticed 7 lights moving following a major road on April 27th 2014, on 10:00 PM. I noticed a full triangular craft flying lower than commercial aircraft. It crossed the horizon silently in about 5 seconds with no vapor trail.
Beaverton, Ontario -- Letting my dog out I looked up on May 4th 2014, at 11:15 PM, to see. I see five lights in formation flying at high speed from east to west flying towards Lake Simcoe. No noise just fast paced. Two behind front leader were swerving side to side as they disappeared in the distance. Thanks to John Hayes
France Lights Not Visible
Vervins -- At the time of sighting we were at the look out at Whiskey Town Lake taking photos on April 22, 2014. The object was not visible to the human eye.
It was later discovered in photos in the camera phones. Photos were taken from an iPhone 5 and from Galaxy 4 camera phones. Thanks to MUFON CMS
Ireland Lights
Letterkenny, County Donegal -- I was out sky watching on a clear night and a red flashing light with a constant red light traveling from the southeast to northwest on April 25th 2014, at 11.30 PM. It was traveling faster than normal planes do and the flight path was not a usual one so it held my gaze as it appeared to slow down and stay still in the distance. There was no sound. I have seen many moving lights in the sky in the past but never one like this. There was no sound. Thanks to John Hayes
Puerto Rico Disc Base
El Yunque - - Freddie, his wife and their young child were taking a drive around the rainforest on Route 191 and took a turn inadvertently deep into the forest in February 1991. They drove thru a camouflaged gate deep in the forest and drove for two miles along a road lit by blue lights. They came to a large metal gate and a building and were stopped by two tall man-like figures and asked who they were. The men wore tight-fitting black one-piece suits, with dark oval shaped helmets with dark visors.
In eerie metallic-electronic sounding voices the strangers ordered the couple to step out of the car. They examined their vehicle and asked how they got there and then held a conversation in a guttural language. A blue truck now arrived with two men wearing blue coveralls also asked how they got there. Freddie noticed a rectangular shaped hollowed out area in the nearby hill with huge glass like doors. Inside there was a metallic disc 30 feet in diameter that was encircled with windows. The men did not appear to notice that Freddie had seen anything and ordered them to follow them out of the area. They were escorted out to the main road. NOTE: The above image is a rendering. Ken Pfeifer MUFON NJ
New Zealand Lights
Oamaru, Waitaki District – On April 25th 2014, at 11:44 PM, I wandered out onto my front porch and spotted two red lights, kind of like stars were heading East towards the sea. The lights were not staying at one level of brightness, they were slowly pulsating, getting dimmer and then brighter again, but not at the same time.
They were two silent objects some distance apart cruising at an average speed. The lower one was quite close to the horizon and the other was much higher and much further in front, but both travelling at the same speed. I ran inside to fetch my camera after watching them for about 8 seconds and ran to get my camera and when I came back out they were gone, even though I could see for many miles. Thanks to John Hayes
UK/England Cylinder
Bath, Somerset -- I saw a cigar shaped UFO on April 15, 2014, which was hovering next to a church steeple for about two minutes. I was waiting in train station and two people watched it with me. As we watched it ascended straight up extremely fast and stopped then plummeted out of view. It then ascended again and stopped and hovered before disappearing.
I was able to get this photo with my camera-phone as it appeared again and ascended back to same spot. Then it shot to the right extremely fast, hovered and then flew off in two seconds. Thanks to MUFON CMS
Hull, East Yorkshire -- I was watching TV around 11 PM on May 2nd 2014 and saw this long bright green LED light appear. I could see loads of what looked like box shape windows on it. By the time I said to my family wow look at this the green thing just disappeared. It had like a curve to it with green windows, but it vanished like it was fading. Thanks to John Hayes
UK/Wales
Twmbarlwn -- At Risca an old iron age hill fort site I managed to photograph a number of UFOs and managed to get up to 15 objects in one frame. I live on the England Wales border where there is an unusually high instance of UFO activity. I can leave a camera running on video and find that in most clips, objects are clearly visible. I have recorded these objects on 35mm, old digital, fixed wildlife stealth camera, video and digital cameras. I have been recording and cataloguing these objects for nearly 15 years in my location. I have seen four objects with my own eyes.: Uncategorized

In an opening ceremony at the Japan-Taiwan Exchange Association, which houses the new center, Japanese Representative to Taiwan Mikio Numata said the center is expected to promote even closer exchanges between Taiwan and Japan.
The center was opened following the signing of a memorandum of understanding (MOU) on cultural exchanges during the Taiwan-Japan economic and trade conference in Tokyo on Wednesday last week, Numata said.
“The MOU is expected to comprehensively boost cultural exchanges between Japanese and Taiwanese culture,” he said.
The center is to work closely with the Taiwan Cultural Center of the Taipei Economic and Cultural Representative Office in Tokyo, he added.
A series of cultural exchange activities are to be held soon, Numata added.
Chiou I-jen (邱義仁), head of the Taiwan-Japan Relations Association, which handles bilateral affairs in the absence of diplomatic ties, said he has high hopes for the center.
“Japan has a unique culture in the Asia-Pacific region. Taiwanese culture has a rich Chinese cultural essence. The coming together of the two cultures will definitely bear much fruit,” he said.
Young Taiwanese are huge fans of Japanese comic books and animated series, Chiou said, but added that Japanese culture goes far deeper.
The center will hopefully continue to promote exchanges that help Taiwanese understand Japanese culture, he said.
The center is on the second floor of the exchange association building, the de facto Japanese embassy in Taiwan.
It has a library with more than 20,000 books on Japanese culture, a tourism information center and conference rooms in the basement.
The library is to be open to the public from 9:15am to 5:30pm on weekdays.Home News Digital transformation’s people problem By Opensource.com July 27, 2017 Digital transformation involves technologies and humans.

Dark outside as we set off for Fakenham then, who doesn't love getting up in the middle of the night to go racing? 😉
Plenty of runners for a change though, looking forward to a good day.
I was at Newbury last weekend, as you all know, and a Tale is on the main piece. Hope you all enjoy it!
We arrive at Newbury at 10, having already worked the Friday there (which was a steady day, nothing special) and stayed at a hotel nearby. Friday night was good fun, we went out with the Corals and Christie lot for a few jars and a meal in a Nepalese restaurant. Never tried Nepalese before and it was rather nice. Sadly at the end of the evening, as we piled into a taxi, I absentmindedly put my hand on the taxi just as Colin was closing his door, and I managed to get my hand trapped in it. Thankfully it was the ball of the hand rather than the fingers, but it’s painful and I start Saturday with a minor injury. Don’t drink, kids.
The pick is at 10.40 (always an hour and a half before the first on Saturdays) and we are on the front row, which is good as it’s raining. When it rains, you always want a front row pick – punters tend to dive out from under the stands, place their bets and dip back under. If you’re on the back row, it won’t matter what prices you’ve got on your board – the punter simply won’t make it that far.
Martyn Of Leicester, in good form, comes over and offers me a day’s work on Tuesday. At this time of the year, every day you pick up is a bonus. Christmas is around the corner, and Ipads for the kids aren’t going to buy themselves.
We start betting an hour before the first and although we’re not expecting much with the weather, it’s steady enough, Sadly for us, Harry Cobden has opened his trap in the pre-race preview and told punters that Posh Trish is by far his best chance of a winner and they’ve latched on. 9-4 opening show into 11-8 at the off. We can’t keep them off it, loads of scores and forties, and from some way out it’s clear it’s one-nil to the punters.
Along comes race 2. A rather posh girl and her boyfriend come up to the joint. He gets a bollocking off her for having £15 on one (“that’s far too much” – I should add she’s holding four glasses of £8 prosecco at this point) before she has her bet. “£3 on number 4” she says, after much deliberation. Nick (who is working with us today) informs her it’s a £5 minimum. So she has another go. “£3 on number 2 then.” I look at Colin, who in turn looks at me. We both look at Nick, who has a face of resignation. After another explanation she gets the hang of things and at the third attempt, manages a fiver bet.
I like working with Nick. His speciality is puns. Poor, poor puns. And jokes. All day long. “That David Bass – something fishy about him” is the general standard that you get with him. You’d think that’s gets wearing after a bit and you’d be right. But rather that than some miserable sod that doesn’t say a word. Don’t change, Nick. 😉
I don’t need to tell you Santini is another shocking result for us and we’re 2-0 down. One bloke is having £75-£80 a race on in various tenners and fivers – he’s clearly putting on for the family. “Have a free pen” I say to him (we’ve giving away pens emblazoned with the MT Racing logo on), at which point he pulls out from his pocket the pen we gave him last year! “Advertising – it works!” crows Colin, who looks delighted. You can see his point – 7 races at £80 a go, £560 worth of business. How much does a box of pens cost?
Bryony to the rescue. Kapcorse is a belting result for the book and as she goes over the line well in front, Colin makes a remark about what he’d happily let Bryony do to him and we’re back in the game. Not for long, though. It’s like hearing parrots. “£20 win Champ.” “£20 win Champ” “£50 win Champ”. Three figure bets too. Can’t get them off it. They’ve looked at the green and gold, a ruck of 1’s next to its name and decided this is the one. They’re right too. The payout queue stretches back to Thatcham.
There’s a good spread of money around for the Gerry Feilden, business is brisk now and there’s plenty of money flying around. Global Citizen, 8-1 to 5-1, is popular but it’s Mont Des Avaloir and Whatswrongwithyou that they really want, and despite the gamble it’s a fair result for us. On to the big one and we’re in full flow now. I give Nick a taste of his own pun medicine. “Backed American in a Yankee here mate” “Have you? Oh, f… off ” as he looks at me laughing and realises he’s been had. Plenty of 3-figure bets around for the likes of Thomas Patrick and Elegant Escape, but when one of the bogeys fades away on the home turn we know we’ve a chance. Sizing Tennessee is a cracking result for us, although Dingo Dollar rolling into the frame in third takes a bit of the gloss off (very popular e/w). I’m happy enough too, with West Approach and Beware The Bear both hitting the first five.
Lucky last time – “time to win your bus fare home, ladies and gents” – and they pile onto the favourite, Lady Buttons, like it’s already home. She romps in on the snaff and instead of getting out to the car park in ten minutes, we’ve another very long payout queue to deal with! Never mind, a winning day. Next stop Fakenham….might not be as busy there, you know….
Not a lot to get stuck into today but the 3.00 at Southwell is quantity rather than quality and looks winnable. I wouldn;t be surprised to see a better effort from Scartare after a wind operation but Oologist looks on the countdown to a win and despite being nudged up a couple of pounds for finishing second to an improver last time out, he's still on a mark below his opening handicap mark. Conditions and trip look fine and it's hard to see why he won't run his race again.
Today's selection – Oologist 3.00 Southwell
Good luck with all your bets today,
David.

Foot Bunions Causes.
Prevention
The simplest way to reduce your chance of developing foot bunion or bunionette problems is to wear good-fitting shoes. Avoid high heels as they push your feet forwards to the front of the shoe where they get squashed. Also avoid narrow fitting shoes, especially those that are pointed at the front with a narrow toe box as again, these place pressure through the toes pushing them inwards. Shoes should be comfortable and leave enough room for you to wiggle your toes. Remember, bunions rarely affect non-shoe wearing people. Exercising your feet can also help. By strengthening the foot muscles you can improve your foot position which can help reduce foot bunion problems. Simple exercises like picking up small objects with your toes can help.

Prevention
Maintain good flexibility through stretching exercises. Avoid excessive running on hard surfaces. Use quality, well-fitting shoes with firm support and a shock-absorbent sole.
What Are The Primary Causes Of Adult Aquired Flat Foot ?_2<<
Pain In The Foot's Arch Cause And_4<<
Causes
Often, tarsal tunnel syndrome is misdiagnosed and confused with plantar fasciitis. Tarsal tunnel syndrome is when the tibial nerve which runs through the ankle, is pinched as it passes through the flexor retinaculum, the supportive band that surrounds the ankle joint. The symptoms of tarsal tunnel syndrome are often limited to the ankle but the since the nerve passes through the entire foot it can cause arch pain. Arch pain associated with foot strain is mainly caused by a pronated foot (rolls inward) or a flat foot. These are usually not singular causes of arch pain, but in combination with other factors, arch pain may result..

An Achilles Tendon Rupture How Do I Know I Suffered One?.
Non Insertional Achilles Tendonitis
Achilles tendonitis will often respond to rest or changes in activity, stretching, or ice after activity. Non-steroidal anti- inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), such as ibuprofen or naproxen may also help. Physical therapy focusing on stretching and strengthening, massage, alternating hot and cold baths, and ultrasound or sound waves can also help with healing and comfort. The temporary use of a heel lift or the insertion of an arch support, called an orthotic, into the shoe or sneaker can also help. Although seldom necessary, the ankle may be kept in a short leg cast or splint. Surgery is rarely needed but can remove bone spurs or the bony prominence of the heel bone. The injection of corticosteroids such as cortisone into the area of the Achilles tendon is usually avoided because it may cause the tendon to rupture.

We’ve been watching via our TV bestie, Apple TV (which can stream Netflix), and couldn’t be happier. This show is a winner!
A TV show about sweet little bumble bees? Yes, you heard me right. Truly, the Bee family has our family loving these creatures and learning lessons while we’re at it. Geared towards toddlers and preschoolers, The Hive takes kids on every day adventures. It teaches valuable ideas like being kind, sharing with siblings, telling the truth and how to interact with community members.
The cast of characters revolve around the Bee family … Mamma, Papa, Buzzbee, Rubee and Babee. Their grandparents are involved as well as a number of neighborhood bugs and fellow bee friends. To say my 3 and 5 year old are in love would be an understatement. The TV rule in our house is often that they must either take turns choosing a show or finding one they mutually agree on. The Hive is almost always the “agree” choice and they’ll excitedly tell me “We agree, we agree … let’s watch The Hive!”
The Hive debuted in 2010-2011 with season one and 2011-2012 brought season two, a total of 78, seven minute episodes. I’m not sure when The Hive joined the Netflix line up, but we just discovered it this summer. Hopefully you already know about it, but if not, here’s your reminder to add it to your queue!
You can watch a few episodes and gather The Hive activities on Disney Junior UK here. I’m printing coloring pages as I type!Reason Middle Child Freestyle Mp3 Download

Another publisher I paid a visit during Gamescom was Headup Games, who graciously provided me with a ton of assistance and review copies the past months, on top of having a quite diverse, interesting line-up. I mean, who wouldn´t want to see games with awful pun titles like Textorcist or crazy ones like Trüberbrook? Well, I certainly was both interested and not disappointed.
First up is Tied Together, a fun little couch coop game. While the visuals are certainly nothing too unique or outstanding, somewhat at the border to looking like a flash game. However, the actual core gameplay is really fun. Basically, up to four players are playing as monsters Tied Together by a long rope, effectively forcing them to cooperate, in order to overcome the various levels. Additionally, every one of them has the ability to dig into the ground and become a pillar for the others.
With this simple new feature, the game does a surprising amount of cool things. While the early levels started out with pretty basic stuff like jumping over holes without dying etc, a few ones later, things got a bit more tactical. For example, getting a key without getting crushed by the force field below it. Every level consists of one key aspect they want to teach, in order to expand on them, at least in the short snippet I saw. So, if the level design can keep that short but smart structure, Tied Together may be one fine couch coop game, anyone can get into and have fun.
Tied Together will release very soon on Nintendo Switch
Next up, another quite fun title called Textorcist. Besides the almost unbearably punny name, it´s quite obviously a typing game where we´re playing an exorcist, killing ghosts through typing his spells. Presented in a dark pixel art style, it´s certainly a unique blend of between those two aspects. Especially since, once you succeed, the game delivers quite a brutal finisher for those nasty ghosts. Though it better do, due to the fact Textorcist isn´t an easy game … really.
After all, being an exorcist isn´t easy with all those huge, complicated spells. At the same time, the ghosts never grant you the time to actually type in the 20-40 words required for each spell, constantly firing bullets at you. Yes, it´s also a bullet hell game, where the screen is littered with projectiles and you have to stare at both the text you need to type and the bullets that are about to hit you. Given, the game saves every finished word but reaching even the end of one can get quite complicated for those not accustomed to the ten finger writing system. Topped off with the dark, self-aware humour a lot of indie games have nowadays, it seems like a neat little title for those typing game lovers. If you will, it´s practically the Dark Souls of those (yes, I had to say it 🙂 )
Textorcist will release 2018 on PC
However, the biggest upcoming title for Headup Games is Trüberbrook, a German adventure game with some truly great ideas. Centring around a professor who´s invited to the little German town Trüberbrook, even though he never heard nro signed up for it. Yet, once arrived, he quickly becomes suspicious of the people and their behaviour. Not only is he confronted with a police scared he might not be human but also by more than creepy citizens and their crazy experiments. So he begins to find himself in a story, where not everything is as it seems and where most likely not everyone is a human. Slowly he begins to explore the town in classic adventure manner, discovering huge, futuristic laboratories, fins himself in creepy interrogations and much more.
As already hinted, it´s an adventure game, though a very simplified one. Ditching giant inventories for a few key items here and then, that have quite clear purposes. In the puzzle demo ,it became clear, how much the game relies on the dialogue hints instead. Often it was all depending on the way a conversation flowed and how much I asked, making exploration a far greater asset than experience in the genre.
What impressed me the most were the unique approach to its style. Rather than building everything digitally, but actually builds all the stuff physically first, before scanning them into the engine, giving Trüberbrook a really unique look. Unfortunately, as amazing as the setpieces look like, my previous showing of Harold Halibut from Curve Digital had a similar approach, letting this one have a far lesser impact than deserved. Still, the unique graphic style paired with the high-quality voice acting surely creates a very immersive experience I´m really looking forward to!
Trüberbrook will release (hopefully) in December 2018 on PC, PS4, Xbox One and Nintendo Switch
Next up will be my final preview of Curve Digital. Look forward to that!The), which is create plans for resistance to the corrupt COP process and a vision for a just transition to sustainable.. reports that Greenhouse Gas (GHG) emissions are rising at an alarming rate. In the 25 years between 1986 and 2011, GHG emissions were equal to the amount released in the previous 236 years. And according to the New York Times, one of the media outlets that previewed the report, and likewise agricultural production of staples such as wheat and corn has decreased. Temperature changes decrease food production by livestock too. Lack of access to drinking water and food insecurity will grow, especially for marginalized communities.
In the United States, the 2014 National Climate Assessment,; risks of lack of access to water and a breakdown in the food system; and risks of economic impacts from loss of ecosystems such as freshwater and marine life. You can review the IPCC report by clicking here and the National Climate Assessment by clicking here.
Recent research into the short term impacts of GHGs needs to be considered as well. Bruce Melton writes that the usual framework that is used for policy decisions is one hundred years, but that misses important short term consequences of current policy decisions. For example, burning coal emits sulfates that actually reduce the impact of global warming by acting as air coolants. Melton estimates that they have “masked up to 57% of warming that should have already occurred.” The negative effect of sulfates is acid rain. When scrubbers are added to coal plants, they reduce the emission of sulfates and their cooling effect. Replacing coal plants with methane gas (inaccurately called natural gas) plants will result in greater warming because methane has a stronger GHG effect than CO2. Melton also warns us to consider the possibility of abrupt climate change in which there can be a rapid rise in temperature over a short time period such as a decade.
The bottom line is that we are experiencing the climate crisis now and the climate alarm has been ringing for decades. Fifteen years have been wasted by political leaders so we must take urgent steps to both mitigate climate change and adapt to the expected impacts so that we can meet our basic needs.
The COP Process is Broken
Following the creation of the IPCC, in 1990, the United Nations.
The COP 3 (third yearly meeting of the Conference of Parties) adopted the Kyoto Protocol, the first international agreement on GHG emissions, in 1997, although it did not go into effect until 2005. Most countries signed onto the Kyoto Protocol which set targeted reductions in GHGs. The United States did not join, and Canada dropped out in 2011 rather than having to pay that can be bought if emissions are greater than are allowed. The scheme failed. One reason was an oversupply of certificates. Prices for the certificates fell and it became cheaper to use dirty energy and purchase certificates than to reduce emissions. A similar mechanism in the protocol allows polluters to build ‘clean, they’ve observed the demise of COP to the point where it has become largely irrelevant and mostly an industry trade show or as they call it, the World Carbon Trading Organization. Similar to the World Trade Organization, the COP meetings are a place where industries can force countries to accept neo-liberal agreements that create ‘public that outside the COP meeting civil society groups from around the world created their own framework, were a shambles. Dominant countries strong-armed weaker countries by threatening their access to necessary funds. Snowden documents revealed that the NSA spied on various countries and leaked documents to undermine proposals for enforceable emissions reductions. Diplomatic cables leaked by Wikileaks show the United States scheming to undermine mandatory emission targets. After creating a mess, President Obama came in at the last minute and pretended to be a hero ‘saving, demands and the path for a just transition. It concluded with a call for a global ‘movement of movements’ and stated “Together, we can make global transitions on buses away from the conference area. The COP17 in Durban, South Africa was called the “Durban Disaster.” Twenty to thirty dominant countries held private talks that resulted in placing a dollar value on to prevent protests. And by the COP19 in Poland, the whole COP process was irrelevant. Big Business held its own private parallel World Climate Summit. False solutions based on the market were promoted such as REDD+ that would result in exploitation of people by displacing them from their land and forests, restricting their access to food and water, forcing them into slave labor and promoting violence against them including assassination of activists. A program known as the misleading “Sustainable Energy 4 All” pushed damaging and dirty biofuels, hydroelectric dams, fossil fuels, methane gas, waste incinerators and nuclear power. We encourage you to read more about these false solutions in The Green Shock Doctrine.
Currently the COP process is working on a binding agreement for 2015 called the Paris Treaty. Rather than addressing the climate crisis, the treaty is expected to continue market-based inadequate solutions that further commodify nature and exploit people. Like the rigged corporate trade agreements, the TransPacific Partnership and TransAtlantic Trade and Investment Partnership, the Paris Treaty will be another tool for corporate profit.
The US is Headed Down the Wrong Path
Despite evidence that the United States can move rapidly to a carbon-free, nuclear free is used to maintain the status quo in the US by promoting a political party or industry agenda under the guise of environmentalism. We wrote about this previously in more depth in Gang Green versus Fresh Greens.
This was evident when Obama announced the new inadequate EPA rules on coal this summer. Ken Ward reports that within a day, the 15 top environmental groups in the US endorsed it rather than calling it what it is, “too little, too late.” Some of the worst players are involved in the US Climate Action Plan, which is holding parallel meetings in New York. The Climate Group includes Duke Energy, Goldman Sachs and a long list of multinational corporations that pursue market based approaches to profit from the climate crisis.
Seeking climate justice
To counter corporate influence, the climate justice movement must be clear in what it stands for. that are organizing around climate justice and real solutions. The Climate Convergence is planning a”Binge Watch Hooked on Wild Waters Season 3 Right Here on JK.com!

The Ibrox club said in a statement this morning that they had decided on an interim team to lead their squad during training and, potentially, the weekend's Premier Sports Cup semi-final at Hampden against Hibs.
Sporting director Ross Wilson will be deep in thought about who should be the next Rangers manager and, while it has been reported that a decision could be made today, it makes sense for a temporary coaching team to be established in any case.
There were a couple of lesser known names in that specific team as well as two that will be more familiar to the Light Blues faithful in Jermain Defoe and goalkeeping coach Colin Stewart.
That said, what do we know about Stewart?
He is the son of former Kilmarnock, Middlesbrough and Rangers goalkeeper Jim Stewart - a man who will be well known to Rangers supporters.
Stewart Snr, who coached at Killie and Hearts, would spend 10 years working with goalkeepers at Ibrox, departing when Pedro Caixinha arrived at the club in 2017.
When Caixinha was sacked after just seven months in charge, Graeme Murty brought Colin Stewart, who had been head of academy goalkeeping, into the first team fold.
And the coach, who represented a myriad of Scottish teams during his playing career, would stay there when Steven Gerrard was appointed manager in the summer of 2018.
Among the teams he featured most prominently for as a player are Ross County, Livingston and Morton.
He is thought to be held in high regard at Rangers and will provide important continuity for Allan McGregor, Jon McLaughlin and Robby McCrorie.
Stewart has spoken highly of the trio in the past, singling McGregor out for praise in April after he signed a new deal.
He said on Rangers TV at the time: "For Allan to do what he's done at the club and come back... and to perform at the level he is, and what he's been doing, it's nothing short of remarkable, to be honest. It's credit to him."Hockey and Pancakes | Vlog #270

The Cuban at Black Bean DeliI didn’t know my face was caved in, but I knew it wasn’t good..
I saw the blood on the ice, but I didn’t know the right side of my face was caved in.
My only thought was, O.K., this is a bad one. How many stitches?
It was Game 6 of the ’96 Western Conference finals against the Colorado Avalanche. We had to win the game in their barn to keep the series alive. The whole series was a bloodbath. To say “there was no love lost” between us would be an understatement. I rarely ever use the word “hate,” but I’ll use it here. We hated them. They hated us. That’s just the way it was.
Moments before, I had collected the puck along the boards and made a pass, and I was drifting backwards right by our bench. The next thing I knew, I got hit from behind. I felt my face hit the top of the boards. Everything went black for a second. I was on all fours, trying to get up, but I couldn’t.
I looked up at our trainer and he was blurry, but I could see this look of horror on his face. I’ll never forget that look. He put a towel over my head to hide my injuries. The last thing I remember is him and Keith Primeau helping me to my feet and escorting me off the ice to the dressing room.
Then I blacked out.
The next thing I remember is waking up in the dressing room, and looking up at our trainers and our doctor, and finally feeling the pain.
Then I blacked out again.
The next time I came to, I sat up and the pain was gone. I didn’t know it, but I was on some serious painkillers. So I started trying to put on my shoulder pads so I could get back on the ice.
Our team doc said, “Kris, what the hell are you doing?”
I said, “What period is it? Am I stitched up?”
He said, “Uh … Kris, you better take a look at this.”
And he walked me over to the mirror.
The right side of my face was caved in.
He told me the damage: Broken orbital bone. Broken cheekbone. Broken nose. Broken jaw.
That was not the worst news.
I asked, “What’s the score?”
“It’s 4–1. Colorado.”
O.K.
Then I asked, “Who hit me?”
“Lemieux.”
March, 26, 1997.
Say the date to anybody in Detroit or Colorado and they’ll know exactly what you mean.
March, 26, 1997.
Exactly 301 days after I broke my face.
It’s hard to believe that it was 20 years ago this month. But if I just tell you the story of that brawl, it won’t do it justice. A 21-year-old reading this right now was just a baby when it happened. If they’ve only seen the YouTube videos, they probably think we were all a bunch of animals. But the reason things got so out of hand on March 26, 1997, is because of everything that happened before and after that brawl.
See, we have to go back.
Everybody involved in that fight had a story. For me, you have to go back to Career Day when I was in sixth grade in West Hill, Ontario. The teacher went around the room and asked every kid what they wanted to be when they grew up.
Doctor. Lawyer. Teacher. Veterinarian.
Everybody smiled and nodded.
When it was my turn to go, I said, “I’m going to play in the NHL.”
I was a small kid, so there was some laughter in the room. After school was over, I was sitting outside on the portable step, and I’ll never forget this as long as I live: This kid (who shall remain nameless), came up to me and said, “Ha! You’ll never play in the NHL.”
Just the way he said it, with such certainty, always stuck with me. I used it as motivation. I’d picture his face, and just the way he said it, and I’d think, Oh yeah? I’ll show you.
My mentality was that I was going to do whatever it took to make it to the NHL, and for the first few years of my career, it was a real struggle. I spent four years in the Winnipeg Jets’ system, mostly toiling away in the minors before they traded me to the Red Wings in ’93, just as Scotty Bowman was taking over as head coach.
So one night I’m playing for the Adirondack Red Wings in the AHL, and I score a hat trick. I come out of the locker room after the game, and there’s Scotty with a few Red Wings scouts. I had no idea they were in the building.
I’m thinking, Finally, they saw the hat trick. Now they know what I can do. Now I’ll get my chance.
The first thing Scotty says to me is, “Do you know how many face-offs you won tonight?”
Face-offs were just starting to be kept as an official stat, especially in the AHL.
So I said, “No, sir, I’m not really sure.”
Scotty said, “You won 19 of 21. Can you do that in the National Hockey League?”
Six weeks later, I got called up to the Detroit Red Wings. The implication was pretty clear. If I wanted to be one of Scotty’s guys, I had to grind. I was 5′ 10″, 180 pounds and I was joining a team with unbelievable skill guys — Sergei Fedorov, Steve Yzerman, Slava Kozlov, Keith Primeau, Vladimir Konstantinov, Paul Coffey, and a young Nick Lidström. So my mindset was that I was going to be the biggest pain in the ass you ever played against. I definitely knew my place. But I didn’t know my exact value until we played the Sharks in the ’94 playoffs. After we beat them in Game 3, I was getting interviewed by a reporter from a San Jose newspaper. After he finished up, he turned to me and said, “Hey, not bad for a kid who was traded for a dollar, huh?”
And he started to walk away.
I said, “Excuse me … what did you just say?”
He said, “Yeah, a dollar. Winnipeg traded you for a buck. Now you’re playing in the Stanley Cup playoffs. Pretty good … Wait, you don’t know the story?”
I turned and looked at our public relations guy, totally confused.
He said, “Uh, yeah, Kris. It’s true.”
I’m like, “What? I was traded for future considerations.”
He says, “Yeah, well, you know, when Scotty called you up from the AHL, they still hadn’t worked out the considerations, officially. So Bryan Murray called Mike Smith and … well … you were traded for cash considerations.”
“A buck?”
“A buck.”
Whenever somebody tells me I was traded for a bag of pucks, I have to politely correct them — because a bag of pucks would’ve been a lot more expensive. But I loved it, because the whole story just added to my underdog mentality.
“Hey, not bad for a kid who was traded for a dollar, huh?”
We ended up losing that first-round series to the Sharks in seven games, which was bitterly disappointing. Then in ’95, we felt like we were so close to the promised land, but we got swept by the Devils in the Stanley Cup finals. That’s when the questions started.
A lot of people don’t remember this now, but at the time, we were getting a tremendous amount of heat for not being tough enough to win a Cup. The media was questioning the leadership of guys like Yzerman and Fedorov, if you can believe that. They were questioning the way our whole team was built. The implication was that we were skilled but soft.
So we came out in ’95–96 with a gigantic collective chip on our shoulders. The first two months of the season, we were on fire. With our speed and skill, we overwhelmed teams. Then, on December 2, 1995, we went into the old Montreal Forum to play Patrick Roy and the Canadiens. That night, something happened that changed hockey forever.
We came out hot. Roy let in four goals, then five, then six….
For whatever reason, they wouldn’t pull him.
Seven. Eight. They still wouldn’t pull him.
We were all kind of looking at each other on the bench like, What’s the deal here?
At one point, the crowd did a mock cheer when Roy made a save. It was ridiculous, because he was such an incredible goalie.
Finally, after nine goals, Roy had had enough and just pulled himself. Later on, it came out in the press that when Roy got back to the bench, he turned to the president of the Canadiens and said, “This is my last game in Montreal.”
Roy was traded to the Avalanche a few days later. That was the moment when the whole rivalry between us and Colorado got its spark. He never forgot what we did to him at the Forum. From that moment on, he took it to another level when he played us.
It felt like destiny that we would have to go through Colorado in the playoffs that season. And, wouldn’t you know it, who was waiting for us in the ’96 Western Conference finals? Roy and the Avalanche.
This is the part of the story where things get a little crazy..
Early in Game 3, Slava Kozlov rammed Adam Foote’s head into the glass and cut him pretty good. Later on in the period, Claude Lemieux snuck up behind Slava and sucker punched him in the back of the head to get revenge.
Our bench went crazy. And then the whole game went crazy. And then the whole series went crazy. Everything turned into a battle. We were battling over loose sticks from the benches.
Game 3 was the moment when the rivalry rose to another level entirely. We wanted to win that series so, so bad. Colorado was not a team full of goons. That’s the thing. They were an unbelievable team that had everything you could want — pure skill with Sakic and Forsberg, grit and experience with Lemieux, Kamensky and Ricci. And, of course, they also had Roy.
They had everything we had. They were a tremendous team, and we didn’t like them one bit.
So when I looked in the mirror after I got hit from behind in Game 6, and I saw my broken face, I was kind of numb.
But when the trainers told me that Colorado had won, and that the series was over….
I was beside myself. I was so disappointed.
The doctors advised me to stay in Colorado to have surgery right away, but I wanted to be on the plane with the guys. I wanted to be back in Detroit. So I draped a towel over my head and walked out of the building, and I got on the plane and waited for the guys.
My teammates didn’t actually know how bad my injuries were until they got on the plane and saw me..”
I still remember sitting at the front of that plane with the doctors, and all my teammates getting on and tapping me on the shoulder and telling me it was going to be alright.
When we got back to Detroit, I was in the hospital for four days. I couldn’t eat solid food for six weeks because my jaw had to be wired shut. Having your jaw wired shut sucks, but it sucked even more in 1996 because they didn’t have all the protein shakes and fancy smoothies in every store like they have today. For the most part, I was drinking Ensure. Sometimes I got lucky and they’d let me have a chocolate milk shake.
I wish this story could have Smell-O-Vision, because if you could only smell a vanilla Ensure right now, you’d know how miserable I really was. But the worst pain, by far, was knowing that the Avalanche were dominating the Panthers in the Stanley Cup finals.
I couldn’t stand to watch. It’s still the only Stanley Cup finals that I’ve never seen a single second of.
As I was sitting in that hospital bed, I promised myself two things:
- I wasn’t going to let the hit affect me mentally.
- It wasn’t to change the way I played.
You have to understand what hockey means to me. It was always my joy in life. I was a small guy to start with, and I made it to the NHL by playing a certain way. If I took my foot off the gas even just a little bit … if I was even just a little bit timid because of that hit, I wouldn’t be effective. I’d be letting my teammates down. I’d be letting the city down. The people of Detroit were in my corner every single day of my recovery. I mean, the response from fans was so overwhelming that I had to get two hospital rooms: One for me, and one to store all the flowers, cards, and stuffed animals that people sent to me. There was so much that I couldn’t take it all home. I donated all the stuffed animals to the pediatric ward.
Detroit is such a blue-collar town, and they love their Red Wings so much.
We had to get back to the Western Conference finals. We had to beat Colorado. We had to win a Stanley Cup.
I would close my eyes and picture the weight room and think, Soon.
As I was leaving the hospital, my doctor gave me a pair of pliers.
“Keep these on you at all times,” he said. “Whenever you leave the house. Whenever you go to bed.”
I couldn’t speak. I just shook my head, confused.
“If you get sick and have to throw up, you’re going to have to cut the wires to keep from choking.”
So I went home with my pliers and my cases of Ensure. It was a long road. I ended up losing almost 20 pounds over the six weeks that my jaw was wired shut.
I’ll never forget the day they came off. My first meal was at Andiamo on the riverfront in Detroit. I ordered the angel-hair pasta. But I still had to have these restrictive bands on my teeth, so I sat there eating it noodle by noodle for like an hour. My friends were on dessert by the time I made it to the 10th noodle, but it was the best feeling ever.
That was the end of June. I had two months to gain 20 pounds back before camp. Whenever I needed motivation to drink an Ensure, I’d just think of The Joe on opening night, and the feeling of walking down the dark tunnel and taking that first step onto the ice.
To be 100% honest, I rarely thought of getting revenge on Lemieux. It wasn’t about that. Unfortunately, Detroit did not feel the same way. It was like the entire city took the hit personally. When the season started, and I was back in the lineup, all anybody wanted to talk about was our first game against Colorado. But, as fate would have it, Lemieux wasn’t in the lineup for our first two games. The third game in Colorado got very heated — you could feel the tension — but the referees were on top of it. Nothing major happened. But you could feel the hatred building and building….
Right up until March 26, 1997.
When it all exploded at The Joe.
I pulled into the parking lot of the arena that night and a TV cameraman followed me from my car to our dressing room. Camera guys never followed me. They’d always follow Yzerman or Fedorov. That’s when I knew: O.K. Here we go.
You could feel it in the dressing room before the game. You could feel it during warmups. They were 3–0 against us that season. They were No. 1 in the division. This was our last game against them going into the playoffs. It was a huge moment.
But the game was relatively tame for most of the first period..
But then, out of nowhere, Brendan Shanahan intercepts Roy and they both go flying.
Next thing I know, Mac is dragging Lemieux over to our bench, as if to say, I told you I’d get him, boys.
Then Vernon and Roy finally make it to one another, and they start brawling at center ice. Not just tying up, but throwing haymakers.
In the middle of all this pandemonium, Marc Crawford, the Avs coach, is yelling at me, “You started all this, Draper!”
And then Scotty Bowman starts yelling at Crawford, “Don’t talk to my players! Don’t you ever talk to my players!”
When the refs finally got ahold of everybody, there were helmets and sticks and gloves and jerseys and blood all over the ice.
What can you say? You just say the date, and everybody knows.
March 26, 1997..
After the refs cleaned up the ice, there was still a game to be played. We were down 5–3 in the third. If we lost, and Colorado swept the season series, then the fight would have meant nothing. But we started chipping away at their lead, and we tied it up at 5–5 to send it to overtime. In OT, who do you think came out and buried the game-winning goal?
Darren McCarty.
We couldn’t have scripted it any better..
We beat them in six games, and I got what I really wanted — what I had burned for since I was in the hospital. I got the handshake line. I got to look every one of them dead in the eyes, and I got to shake their hands knowing that I was going to the Stanley Cup finals, and they weren’t.
As soon as Lemieux turtled at The Joe, everything changed.
In the finals, the Flyers were heavily favored to beat us. They were “too big, too strong, too fast.”
First shift. Game 1. Philly comes out with the LEGION OF DOOM. Lindros. LeClair. Renberg.
Everyone expects that.
But nobody expected who Scotty sends out.
The Grind Line.
Me, Joe Kocur and Kirk Maltby.
What a feeling. Almost exactly a year to the day that I was laying in a hospital bed with my jaw wired shut. Now I’m starting Game 1 of the Stanley Cup finals.
We came out flying. After finally beating Colorado, we were not going to be denied. We took Game 1 on our way to a sweep.
That first time you touch Lord Stanley, after so many years of burning for it, your life flashes before your eyes. Your whole journey plays like a quick film in your mind. I wanted that Cup so bad, for so many reasons. But mostly I wanted to prove to myself that one hit wasn’t going to define my career, or change the love I had for the game.
We won again in ’98, 2002, and 2008.
Now, we’re known as champions. But on March 25, 1997, we were called “soft.” Our leadership was questioned. Some people wanted to blow up the team.
Do we still win the Stanley Cup without that brawl? Maybe. But I know that it certainly didn’t hurt.
Over the years, Lemieux and I never spoke about what happened. He never apologized, and I didn’t need him to. They won Cups. We won Cups. Even if I didn’t like him very much, I actually respected how clutch he was as a player.
Then, a couple of years ago, I was at the 2014 NHL draft as a member of the Red Wings’ front office. My whole family was there with me — my wife and three kids. When the draft was over, we were waiting outside for a taxi to take us to the airport, when my wife’s face suddenly went pale. She was looking right through me.
She said, “Lemieux’s walking towards us.”
I wasn’t going to turn around. I didn’t think I had anything to say to him.
Sure enough, I feel a hand on my shoulder. I turn around and it’s Claude.
He says, “Oh, is this your family?”
My son, Kienan, has watched every single YouTube video in existance of the Wings-Avalanche rivalry. He knows the whole story. So he was looking up at Claude with these big eyes, like, Oh, my God. Here he is, in real life.
Claude bent down and shook his hand, and my son just kind of looked at him in awe. Claude politely introduced himself to my whole family, and shook everybody’s hand.
And that was it. We went our separate ways.
I’m glad we had that moment. For everything that we went through during that rivalry, the beauty of our game is that at the end of the day, as (much older) men, we are still able to shake hands.
Now that it’s the final year for The Joe, people have been talking about their favorite memories of the place. We won two Stanley Cups in that building, and yet every time I meet a Wings fan, you know what they want to talk about?
March 26, 1997.
Those gongshow days are gone now, and it’s probably for the betterment of the game. But ask anybody from Detroit, and they can tell you exactly where they were when that brawl went down. Long after that arena is torn down, people will still remember that night.
It defined a rivalry, and it defined my career for a lot of fans.
But for me, when people ask about my favorite memories of The Joe, I always give a boring answer. And I do it because it’s the truth: It’s the Stanley Cups. The sacrifice it takes to lift one Stanley Cup is almost beyond words.
I went on to win four of them with teammates who I consider brothers. They can never take that away from us.
So, to a certain sixth grader in West Hill, Ontario, from a very long time ago, I’ll say it again: Oh yeah?As I already mentioned on the previous post that we only can give the condition of attribute name to filter the result.

Some paid plugins may be worth paying for.Think about what the cost of your time and compare that to what the plugin costs.
Some plugins are worth paying for. Consider the value of your own time, and stack it up against the price of a plugin. If there are many features offered at a low price, this is a great investment that can save time.

Web design firms tend to have a whole lot of costs associated with their business such as staff members, overhead, and debt. Single web site designers tend to be self-employed, with little over head and willing to work for below one-third the price tag on the companies. There are numerous good designers that are out of work, in the economy, which will work for an affordable rate. Finding these designers, without shelling out large service fees, can be cumbersome and lead to exhausting searches. Here are some tips for locating a cheap web development company.
– No cost Advertising – Look at spots that you can advertise for free. These types of mediums involve posting about boards at colleges, style schools and local coffee outlets. Another great moderate is web based boards and listing products. There are frequently postings from web designers real estate their skills and their amount – these kinds of will be a goldmine if you are looking for cheap, quick webdesign and there’s someone marketing they are available and willing to function.
– Work Boards — If you definitely want to be bombarded with applications for web designers, post a job listing over a job aboard. Avoid job boards that need you to pay off to list your posting. As well, avoid job boards that require that you fork out the designer through their support (the task board makes money this way, plus the designer will get less money — also the penalty for contacting a designer over and above the job mother board can be quite large. ) Always be very particular in your work posting -state what you want in a designer, require the designer fill in examples of earlier work and references, and state the timeline for the purpose of delivery belonging to the web site along with what you are willing to pay for. Be sure to establish the location of the designer. Many job boards have international designers. While this may seem like the cheapest method to take, the headaches in working with someone who will not speak English as their first of all language can be much more expensive than spending a little bit more funds and getting an individual in the country which you have chosen.
— Canned Sites – If you want the cheapest on the cheap, you should go with a canned web site. This is also the fastest way to get your web site up and running. You will find drawbacks, nevertheless. Canned web-site companies permit you to choose a design template, make the provide you desire, and pay a small payment. This service charge may be ongoing or a one time fee. Up to date this option noises great, simple cheap. But , if at a later date you want to upgrade your web site, you might be in for pleasantly surprised. Most of these dropped web sites do not let you to own the design or perhaps content. If you wish to upgrade, you either have to pay this company a substantial amount of money to upgrade and redesign or else you will have to begin with scratch.

Visiting Buffalo battled the New York Rangers to a draw into the final minute Sunday, but Ryan Lindgren put a shot past Aaron Dell with one second left and the Sabres lost 5-4.
The Sabres have lost two in a row -- including a 5-0 shutout by Calgary -- and eight of their last 10 (2-7-1) since a 5-1-1 start.
"We need to be assertive. When we struggled in the third, we hesitated, maybe took a step back," Buffalo coach Don Granato said. "These situations that's happened to us in the last few days, when you're not getting what you want, you tend to be more hesitant -- and we can't have that happen."
Rasmus Dahlin and Tage Thompson each had a goal and an assist, and Dell made 31 saves for the Sabres. Rasmus Asplund and Vinnie Hinostroza also scored.
Sabres forward Victor Olofsson had one assist and one shot on goal in his return after missing the previous eight games with an undisclosed injury.
Asplund's first-period power-play goal gave Buffalo a 1-0 lead and ended an 0-for-16 drought with the man-advantage.
"I think we bounced back good from last game (a 5-0 loss to the Calgary Flames on Thursday)," Asplund said. "We showed up to play today. Of course it stings, what happened at the end there. But we've just got to keep learning and keep earning it."
The Blue Jackets are also coming off a frustrating one-goal loss. They led 2-0 after one period in Las Vegas on Saturday but were blanked the rest of the way in a 3-2 loss.
After outshooting the Golden Knights 13-7 in the first period, Columbus was outshot 28-16 over the final 40 minutes.
"Solid first and then we were forcing things, turning pucks over, and then yeah, it unraveled," coach Brad Larsen said. "It was hard to watch us play like that for two periods. That's not us. We haven't done that much lately, so to watch us play like that, it was really frustrating."
Gustav Nyquist and Alexandre Texier scored, and Jake Bean and Zach Werenski each had two assists for the Blue Jackets, who had won their two previous games. Elvis Merzlikins made 32 saves. He has allowed three or more goals in each of his past four starts.
Werenski has six points (two goals and four assists) in his past four games, and Texier has four goals in his past six games. Oliver Bjorkstrand leads the team with 17 points (five goals and 12 assists) but has gone five games without a goal.
Columbus entered Saturday with the 10th-ranked power play in the NHL, converting at 22.5 percent, but went 0-for-4 against Vegas. In addition, the unit gave a game-tying short-handed goal in the third period.
"Obviously they scored a short-handed goal, which is never good," Werenski said. "Just trying to force some plays. We didn't really take what was given to us. You learn from it and we watch some video. We have a big game Monday, just try to get back to how we have success."

I live in a town with a population of about 6,000 predicted to grow to 20,000 during the next decade. Yet there are some fundamental resources missing here including a leash-free dog park. This is a dog town.
“I discovered that while going door-to-door,” one candidate said at a townhall last election. “If there wasn’t a dog at one house, there was two in the next to make up for it.”
And yet, he dismissed the idea of a dog park. I didn’t vote for him.
Clearly, dog parks – or lack there of – is not the most pressing need in town. But it’s on the list along with affordable housing, a long-term care facility, accessible daycare, public transit and improved emergency services. Actually, that’s Cheryl Beemer’s list. Beemer is running for town councillor and if you live in Caledonia, Ontario please vote for her October 22, 2018.
If you don’t live in Caledonia, please ask your local candidates about their ‘dog’ platforms. Seriously.
Granted, not all pet parents like leash-free dog parks. Everyone’s heard a horror story. Bites are a risk. But there are ways to do parks right, from large and small dog divisions to educating owners about signs of canine aggression. And dog parks can be beneficial for many reasons – if this wasn’t true, there wouldn’t be one in (almost) every community.
Benefits of Dog Parks
Exercise – Obviously. Health-related obesity issues are rising for both pets and people. Dogs need to run and running wouldn’t hurt some people either. Leashed walks don’t always offer a full energy burn – at least not with dogs like mine – and that can lead to an array of behaviour and anxiety issues. Few can argue getting outdoors and moving isn’t a good thing.
Socialization – Again, not just for the pups but that’s the first thing about a dog park most people talk about. Dogs are social creatures – some more than others, but pack life is in their DNA. The more positive social interactions dogs have, the better. Plus, sometimes only another dog can run a terrier tired.
Community – Ultimately, dog parks can be positive for everyone because they’re a gathering site for people (and yes, pets). We need more of that. Towns and cities need more of that. As urban planning is becoming more decentralized, we are losing opportunities to gather and connect with people outside our families and familiar circles.
Dog parks offer like-minded people the opportunity to connect with others, or just be there exchanging a few words. Dogs are conversation starters, particularly among fellow pup people. You’ll might even interact with others you’d otherwise never cross paths with. Add a Facebook group for the local dog park, and you’ve taken community one step further: sharing complaints in a public forum; educating park users; and even posting obituaries of both dogs and people resulting in supportive replies. You create a tribe.
Healthy communities can’t be developed by traffic flow solutions and economics alone. Healthy communities need parks, conservation areas, nature trails, art galleries, community centres, libraries and yes, dog parks. Healthy communities are what attracts educated skilled labour and thus fiscal growth. And if that labour force happens to love dogs, don’t fight it. Build it.
If you live in Ontario, please vote October 22 for the local representative who will make your community just a little more pooch friendly. If you live in Caledonia, please vote for Cheryl Beemer.
UPDATE: Unfortunately, Cheryl Beemer did not win the Haldimand County Ward 3 seat, but here’s hoping the new person who did is open to the dark-park idea,
with dog ownership growing all the time, it makes a lot of sense to consider dog park accommodations for residents as a talking point. victor’s sweater is cute. need one for his buddy Sasha

True. But unfortunately common sense seens to be in short supply these days…Deryn the way she normally appears in her protective gear.
Deryn the way she normally appears in her protective gear.
- “Of course, the bees in the Far North are quite resourceful, and part of that resourcefulness comes from a strong bond between them and their keepers.” ―Deryn, when asked by a merchant why her honey tasted so good.
Deryn is a 21 year old female snow leopard who primarily has lived as a nomad past the age of 16, but is now planning to settle down in Fedoria where she hopes to finally be able to live past simply surviving on her honey and the good nature of others.
She is a Master Beekeeper, though when asked to provide credentials to back up this title she won't have an immediate answer, offering question to the credibility of her status, let alone the title's existence. However, she proves herself to be an expert apiarist, and one of the rare few in the entire world who have been catalogued as being Apimancers.
Deryn was orphaned as a snow leopard at an unknown age in a land she refers to as the Far North. She was fostered into a home by her Uncle Johann, though records have shown no blood relation whatsoever between the two, which would evidently point to the name Uncle simply being a pet term for her foster caregiver. Deryn learned beekeeping first from Johann, who had been a beekeeper himself since before he adopted Deryn. He taught her much of what she knows as a beekeeper, and gave her experience on his vast apiary. However, due to circumstances unknown to the the wiki, Deryn suddenly left her home at 16 years old and began travelling on the road with a hive full of her bees.
Personality
Deryn is a very ardent observer, finding content on simply watching and taking notes to learn. This doesn't mean she is opposed to taking part in the action herself, considering she has put herself in the field ever since her Uncle Johann taught her how to care for bees.
Her solitude in the Far North has contributed somewhat to her naïvety, but this is not to be taken as a sign of foolishness. Her years on the road and in nature have filled her with knowledge that would rival that of a midwife or even a doctor. With her combined experience in beekeeping, horticulture, and natural medicine, she is able to help as many people in need as she can, though this can be to her fault as she tends to put others before herself.
Deryn is a characteristically Lawful Good person. She exhibits traits of a person who follows the rules set forth by authorities, and doesn't try to make trouble for herself. However, she is not afraid to speak her mind and rebel against injustices, notably those committed by tyrannical powers or characteristically Evil characters.
She is very generous, and has even been noted refusing trade with merchants simply on her principle belief that everyone should be able to eat, even if they are unable to pay. This has proven to be her foil many times however, leaving Deryn with nothing to eat typically but her own honey.
Deryn as a Beekeeper
Like most beekeepers, Deryn employs countless methods and tools to care for her bees and to make sure they are in healthy condition. Unlike most beekeepers, she also has developed a couple unique tools for her art that is almost assuredly original inventions.
One of her most notable pieces of equipment is the beehive on her back, a simple miniature hive with 5 interlocking and restackable frames that house her bees, which are almost never out of arms reach of her body. The only two openings are the large lid on the top, so she is able to open it and inspect her hive, and the small ingress/egress hole at the backside for her honeybees to come and go freely. The hive is observed to be made of pine wood, with a thin layer of pitch applied to the "roof" of the hive (Possibly for waterproofing).
The second piece of equipment that is also unique to Deryn is her smoker staff. A long, cedar staff approximately seven feet in height and about 1.75 inches in diameter, this is Deryn's primary tool for calming her bees whenever they become agitated, be it from a looming presence, sharing Deryn's frustration, and even early premonitions of future events. At the top of the staff is the smoker body, a wrought-copper container with a small opening to direct the flow of smoke and a steel heat guard around the body. Connected to that is a piece of leather tubing, which coils down half the length of the staff and is attached to a wooden bellows, which Deryn pumps every few moments to feed the smoldering fuel inside the smoker air to burn. On occasion, she'll attach flowers to the top of the staff as a general decoration and perhaps as a way to calm her bees further.
Deryn and Her Bees
She cares for them deeply, like a mother would care for her children. Due to the unique group intellect of her bees, they ultimate are able to reciprocate the emotions that Deryn has, though this is still being disputed as whether this is because they are capable of simple mimicry or if they in fact have an emotional bond with Deryn (When asked by wiki editors, Deryn claimed the latter).
Deryn's bees are a unique breed all of their own. While still possessing key traits of the common insect Apis Mellifera, Deryn's bees have been bred for their environmental hardiness, remarkably rapid brood rearing rate (Typical worker hatches in 21 days, Deryn's breed hatches in 12 hours), and rapid honey production.
Deryn rarely finds herself in violent conflict, but when the rare need arises, she can direct her bees into a focused attack on a stronger character, or a devastating spread attack on multiple lighter characters. Despite having a unique command over her bees, Deryn doesn't care to employ it if she does not readily require their assistance. Rather, she allows them to freely come and go as they please, like a beekeeper would allow with a stationary hive. No matter where Deryn is, the bees will always find their way back to the hive since it is marked with their pheremones, and Deryn's natural apimancer attraction.Toggle navigation

Fiano wine grape
Fiano
A white grape from Campania (the lower shin of Italy’s boot), Fiano was first recorded under its own name in the 13th Century, and may even be the variety used to make the famous ancient Roman wine, Apianum. It was once common across southern Italy but fell out of favour due to its low yields. When the phylloxera epidemic forced all Italian vineyards to be replanted on American rootstocks around the beginning of the 20th Century, most producers seized the opportunity to replace it with more productive though less characterful varieties.
By the 1950s it was nearly extinct, but since then it has staged a remarkable comeback instigated by the great Campanian producer Mastroberardino. It is still found mainly in its native Campania, where Fiano di Avellino is one of the few Italian white wines to carry DOCG status, but it has also been enthusiastically planted in Sicily by producers like Settesoli and Planeta, whose famous Cometa is made from it. Even more recently it has become fashionable in Australia, though there is still less than 200 hectares planted there.
Fiano’s small, thick-skinned berries ripen late, but achieve high sugar levels. Its wine is full-bodied and powerfully flavoured, with herbal and floral scents, and a honeyed quality. It can age very well, developing notes of spices and nuts.

Cancellation and Rescheduling PolicyDear Parents,
As the school year closes, the district is actively preparing for the beginning of the 2011-2012 school year. The recent funding cuts to education amounted to approximately $349 less per student next year. After many months of budget advisory meetings and discussions at board meetings, the district will charge students for home-to-school transportation next year. The district is still working out the details on the exact cost per student and the exact method for tracking students’ use of transportation. In the meantime, there will be a transportation form coming home with each student. It is extremely important that each student, who intends to use school transportation next year, complete the form and send it back before the end of year.
Although the financial cuts to McKinleyville Union School District amount to over $300,000 the district has been able to ensure art, music, electives for the Middle School, and class sizes remain at the current level for next year. The goal to keep the cuts as far away from the students has been obtained because of the partnership with the parent organizations at each site, the dedication to do more with less from all our employees, and the district office staff’s ability to monitor expenses closely.
The following year will present challenges once again to continue to increase students’ proficiency levels in math and reading with very limited financial resources. I appreciate all the input from parents and community as we proactively make plans together on how to deal with yet another year of less funding for education.
~Dena McCullough, superintendent, McKinleyville Union School DistrictHORROR IN THE AYLESHIRE UPLANDS . . .
To all appearances the room was unoccupied.
Moments later a feeling as of doom impending swept over me with a chill. Whose house was this, I wondered? And how had I come to be here?
Hanging from a peg was a tiny silver call, such as might be used to summon a domestic. It was a curious little thing, of a peculiar and antique workmanship. I saw at once that it was valuable. Much intrigued I was about to apply it to my lips, to test the sound, when I became aware of a stealthy movement in the room.
A figure -- that of an elderly man with grave features, craggy and deep-seamed -- sprang up from behind one of the wing-chairs on the hearthrug. He eyed me uneasily. "What do you mean to do?" he asked.
As I raised the call to my lips he flung a warning hand at me. "No, sir, no! Do not sound the call!" he cried, in a tone of stifled horror. "Take heed, sir -- lest the devils be unchained!"
CHARACTERSSrinagar, Feb 11: Doctors Association Kashmir (DAK) on Monday said swine flu infection significantly increases the risk of heart attack and stroke.
“If you catch swine flu, you are at an increased risk of having a heart attack or stroke,” said DAK President Dr Nisar ul Hassan.
Quoting a Canadian study published in The New England Journal of Medicine, Dr Nisar said people who get flu are six times more likely to have a heart attack in the first week of the illness.
“The risk is particularly high among elderly and those with underlying heart conditions,” he said.
“In another study at Columbia University in United States flu increased the odds of having a stroke by nearly 40 percent,” Dr Nisar said.
“The most significant risk occurred in the 15 days following the illness, but patients with flu continued to have elevated risk of stroke for an entire year,” he said.
Dr Nisar said flu causes acute and severe inflammation that builds up fat deposits in the inner walls of blood vessels. These fat deposits dislodge and get stuck in heart or brain, where they block the blood flow.
He added flu activates blood cells and clotting system leading to increased risk of blood clots.
“The number of heart attacks and stroke patients in Kashmir doubles in winter and flu is a major factor,” he informed
He said the risk is similar to the risk seen for other known risk factors, such as high blood pressure, diabetes or smoking.
Dr Nisar said you can prevent many heart attacks and strokes by getting vaccinated against flu.
“Studies have shown people who receive flu shots are 55% less likely to suffer a heart attack or stroke,” he said.
“Ideally, people should get vaccine by the end of October. However, getting vaccinated later can still be beneficial and vaccination should continue to be offered throughout the flu season,” Dr Nisar advised. 1301 Women's Button Front Warm-Up Jacket$23.86 - $26.36

It's healthy and delicious and seriously easy to make - but even easier if you have a food processor or a Cuisine Companion (or a Thermomix!).
Whilst I've been making Zucchini Slice for years, I've found that I make it even more now that my Cuisine Companion means it takes just 30 seconds to chop all of the ingredients.
It's the perfect recipe for a quick meal on the go. I usually make up a big batch on Sunday for quick lunches whilst I'm working during the week. Best of all? You can use up just about whatever you have in the fridge.
If I don't have ham I'll use bacon or cooked chopped chicken or leave it out altogether. If I don't have enough zucchini I'll use grated carrot or sweet potato instead and I've been known to mix in corn, peas and whatever else I have that needs using up!
So let me share the recipe with you! >>
Easy Healthy Zucchini Slice Recipe
makes 4-6 large pieces
low fat, gluten free, clean eating friendly, high protein
3-4 medium zucchini, grated (about 2 1/2 cups or 400g)
1 small white or brown onion
~1/2 cup ham, roughly chopped (you can also use bacon or chopped chicken)
6 eggs (*see notes for a lighter option)
1 cup (100g) grated cheese of your choice**
1 1/2 cups (180g) gluten free self raising flour
1 tsp garlic salt
Fresh basil and parsley, finely chopped (optional but recommended!)
- Preheat your oven to 180C/355F
- Line a 9x13" baking dish with baking paper and set aside.
- If using a Cuisine Companion/food processor, process your zucchini and onion until finely chopped (in the Cuisine Companion I use the kneading and crushing blade on S11 for 20-30 seconds). If not, grate your onion and zucchini instead.
- Add your ham, eggs, cheese, flour, salt and herbs (if using) to your vegetable mix and mix until just combined (about 30 seconds on S8 in the Cuisine Companion or just pulse it in your food processor)
- Pour your mixture into your prepared tin and bake for 40 minutes to an hour, or until cooked through. Cooking times will vary so keep an eye on it and take it out as soon as a skewer inserted into the middle removes clean!
- Allow to cool slightly before slicing and serving or storing in an airtight container in the fridge for up to 4 days or freeze pieces in airtight ziplock bags for a quick and easy option when you need them. Simply defrost them in the fridge overnight, in the microwave or heat them up in the oven.
Notes:
*If you want to lighten up the recipe, use 3 eggs and 6 egg whites (3/4 cup or 90g)
**You can use tasty cheese, cheddar, parmesan or just about whatever cheese you like! I often use 1/2 cup tasty cheese and 1/2 cup crumbled feta for something different!
But tell me, what are some of your favourite quick and easy lunch or dinner options?
Mine turned out perfectly this morning just wondering if you knew the calorie per 100 grams.
Hey Casper, I don't but you can use an app like My Fitness Pal to work out the exact nutritional information for the ingredients you used :)Ninja Turtle Coloring Pages For Kids

No more driving and parking headaches for you to worry about! No matter what time of the day or night it is, you can easily shop for all that you want in paint it red clothing!
It helps save up on time
Another truly amazing thing about online shopping is that it helps you save on a whole lot of time. See the fact of the matter is that you can now find the casper & pearl womens clothing of your choice in just a few minutes. There is no longer the need for you to shop around, drive to different stores just because you can’t seem to get your hands on the clothing items that you are interested in! With the limited amount of free time that we all have at hand these days, this convenience is surely God sent for us. No more hassling around different stores – just go online and look for the dresses that you are interested in.
It offers a wide variety of clothes for you to choose from
Like it or not, but the paint it red online shopping experience is one that is going to be etched in your mind forever. See the thing is that local stores have a limited variety – whether you like the clothes available there or not, you’re stuck with them. On the other hand, when it comes to online shopping, you have a wide variety of stores to choose from and all of them offer a variety of clothes for you to select.VIA is a central tenet of the program.
Our participants come to the program with a wide range of disabilities including physical and intellectual disabilities, learning disabilities, mental health and addictions. We work with each person as an individual to help them recognize showcase and enact their unique strengths and create hope, optimism and flourishing in the world of work.
Somewhere along the way, we realized that we are pioneers in working with such a wide cross section of people with disabilities and intersectionality gathered together in one room. We are truly a village – participants, educators, classroom assistants, social work practicum students, coaches, employment specialists all supported by an amazing agency and their program team. We pay special attention to training and orienting this village to the culture and context of the program and toward social action and supports in the broader context. We’ve learned a lot from our experience and most of all from our greatest teachers, our participants.
We’d like to share some of what we’ve learned:
- We’ve learned that in order to help participants connect their VIA Strengths to the world of work, we need to help them recognize and learn to tell stories about how they have used their strengths: in previous job experiences; in volunteer work; in school; with friends and family and in the community.
- We have created unique exercises that help integrate VIA Strengths into every aspect of our work:
- Spotting strengths through peak experience story telling
- Re-imagining past difficult situations using strengths to create new possibilities for future outcomes
- Celebrating a “character strength of the day” by brainstorming about the meaning of that strength and what behaviours might look like at work
- Weaving strengths into “STAR” Stories to prepare for behavioural interviews
- Creating a “Work-life Portfolio” as a reflective learning tool
- Implementing a follow up journal for use after the classroom portion of the program is complete to help participants spot their use of VIA strengths outside the classroom, to consider overuse and underuse and to reflect on ways to combine signature strengths to boost lesser strengths
- Some participants complete the survey in 15 minutes while others need support for about an hour, all depending on the nature of the person’s ability. We are considering using the VIA Survey supplemental guide to assist people with different disabilities to complete the VIA Survey in a validated way (the free PDF can be found here). The good news is that either way, it can be done with minimal intervention and maximum joy! Perhaps these are the participants that revel in learning their unique strengths profile the most!
- On the last day of a recent program, we asked participants to “Pay it Forward”, to let future participants know what they had gained through learning about their VIA Strengths. Here are some wise words they shared:
- “I have learned to have clear conversations around who I am, and what my strengths and weaknesses are.”
- “Knowing my strengths allows me to put them forward in a timely and beneficial manner to [a] potential employer. They empower me.”
My consulting firm PersonaGrata Consulting was commissioned to develop the program and to provide Learning and Coaching Practice Leadership. One of the reasons the social service agency, Brands for Canada selected us, was that VIA Strengths is at the centrepiece of the work we do, whether it is program development, education or coaching. Together, we have a created a unique collaborative alliance. Adler Professional Coach Training enables us to recruit professionally trained coaches to work with our participants individually. DIG Insights is our professional, credentialed evaluator, so that we can validate the efficacy of our program and ensure long-term program funding.
We are grateful for the guidance of The VIA Institute on Character for their encouragement in joining together Positive Psychology practitioners from around the world to share research and resources on strengths work for people with disabilities. We are also grateful to Darren Coppin of Esher House UK for his wisdom and his research on positive psychology interventions for people who are long term unemployed.
We hope that future developments for the program will include a program for training employers in hiring and helping people with disabilities flourish in the workplace; expanding the scope and reach for our Coaching for Social Purpose Coach training model and overall expanding our geographic reach.
There is a real human and social cost of unemployment for people with disabilities. Together, PersonaGrata Consulting, Brands for Canada, Adler Professional Coach Training and Dig Insights have created a unique collaborative partnership to supercharge employment outcomes for people with disabilities.

Spacecraft Launch Mission Status Test Campaigns Experiments References
The increasing population in space of defunct satellites and other man-made debris is an issue that is getting strongly the interest of legislators, agencies and industry. In order to guarantee a safer and sustainable access to orbit, it is necessary to stop the systematic non-operative defunct satellites concentration increase in orbit. This seems to be feasible with an approach based on a preventive debris removal solution, whereby a dedicated and independent de/re-orbiting propulsion system is installed on the satellite prior to launch allowing a safe and quick decommissioning of the spacecraft before it will become a debris. 1) 2) 3) 4)
Today both the industrial and scientific space communities agree that effective SDM (Space Debris Mitigation) measures are necessary in order to maintain future space activities below an acceptable level of risk. LEO (Low Earth Orbits), especially, together with the other upper orbits are getting more and more crowded and the space industry strongly depends on how the issue of space debris is effectively managed.
Space Agencies introduced dedicated activities as the Clean Space Initiative of ESA, which is setting a clear roadmap towards the development of building blocks enabling the compliance of SDM requirements on future satellite platforms ; 5) the activities of the Orbital Debris Program Office of NASA, which was the first organization to develop orbital debris mitigation policy and guidelines already back into the 90s and now focusing the efforts on modeling, measurement, protection, mitigation and reentry issues ;6) the activities of JAXA's Space Debris managed by the Innovative Technology Research Center . 7) Together with governmentally backed programs, there is a relevant number of activities that are proceeding as private initiatives on a commercial, quasi-commercial or private institutional basis.

End-of-life disposal technologies are under development and testing, which can be divided into both passive:
• electromagnetic tethers: low mass, low volume, negligible power but no possibility of a controlled re-entry, non-compliance with regulations for large satellites, operationally complex, long time monitoring required. Not working if the satellite gets defunct.
• drag augmentation (e.g. sails, balloons, booms): low mass, low volume, negligible power but no possibility of a controlled re-entry, non-compliance with regulations for large satellites, operationally complex, only suitable altitudes below 600 km, long-time monitoring required, low TRL, increased impact probability with debris. Not working if the satellite gets defunct.
Active systems:
• electric propulsion: medium mass, low volume, space proven but low impulse (no controlled reentry), not compliance with regulations for direct re-entry of space vehicles, operationally complex, long time monitoring required, high power needed. Not working if the satellite gets defunct.
• liquid propulsion: medium mass, medium volume, already available on most spacecraft, space proven but very complex system, large mass and volume if controlled reentry has to be provided, high power needed.
• solid propulsion: medium mass, low volume, space proven, low level of complexity, high thrust, relevantly low impact on spacecraft design but mass impact on the spacecraft and no re-ignition possible.
Within this context, the company D-Orbit LLC of Como, Italy, is commercializing a unique device for satellite direct and controlled decommissioning called D3 (Dedicated Decommissioning Device). 8) 9) 10)
In view of current launch rates, D-Orbit suggests the embodiment of an on-board dedicated decommissioning device in satellites, named D3 (D-Orbit Decommissioning Device). A device using an independent system based on solid propulsion technology seems a practical and efficient option and can be implemented using current technologies. Such a device has the following features: it works even if the satellite is malfunctioning or death; it is compliant with ESA and NASA standards on safety; it is single point of failure free (except for the motor); it is reliable for the entire life of the satellite; it is scalable and adaptable to different kinds of missions.
D-SAT program - a challenge: In order to achieve and demonstrate the technology maturity and demonstrate space experience, D-Orbit decided to perform an in-orbit demonstration of such a device. The constraints on costs and mass led the company to work on the system miniaturization and to end up with the decision of manufacture a real satellite with the less volume and mass possible, with a fully and functional decommissioning device. The result was the design and development of a nanosatellite, D-SAT, based on a 3 Unit CubeSat standard..
The main reasons why the company decided to invest in D-SAT project are:
• demonstrate the Decommissioning Device technology, which is the core business of the company, thanks to a full controlled-quick and safe re-entry of a LEO satellite through the D3 as an effort to demonstrate TRL 9 (Technology Readiness Level-9).
• gain visibility and boost the company brand
• create opportunities and increase cooperation and collaboration with other companies
• gain capabilities in nanosatellite manufacturing, validation and testing, both software and hardware
• gain experience in satellite operations
• gain capabilities in dealing with explosive materials and safety laws and regulations for storage, handling and transportation
• gain experience on the integration logistics of the Decommissioning Device in view of its use for other applications
• increase the space community awareness on space sustainability and the threat of space debris on space missions
• let the general public know about space debris and the potential risk at which all the satellite services are exposed
• let the satellite commercial operators know about D-Orbit technology they may use to increase their satellite lifetime in orbit, decrease complexity of the decommissioning phase, avoid collisions in orbit and eventually properly dispose the satellite avoiding extra costs.
The D-SAT mission is the first example of a CubeSat adopting a solid propellant motor for active deorbiting services at the end of its mission. The decommissioning device is installed in a 3U CubeSat, with the objective to remove the satellite from its service orbit through a controlled atmospheric reentry path.
The project started in 2014 and was initially financed by D-Orbit internal investments and from December 2015 part of D-SAT project has received funding from the European Union's Horizon 2020 research and innovation program.
With reference to Figure 1, the main phases of the mission are: (1) D-SAT is loaded in the launcher, (2) D-SAT is deployed in a LEO orbit of 500 km altitude; (3) completed the LEOP operation, D-SAT performs the SatAlert, DeCAS and AtmoAnalyzer experiments, (4) completed the mission, D-SAT executes the firing maneuver controlled and commanded by ground, (5) the decommissioning maneuver location is high over the Atlantic Ocean to minimize the risk for people and assets during the atmospheric entry.

In order to identify, collect and understand the applicable requirements, and identify the best integration, test campaigns and transportation logistics, an extensive work was done in closed collaboration between the nanosatellite owner, D-Orbit, the solid rocket motor manufacturer, Bayern Chemie GmbH, Aschau am Inn, Germany, and the Launch Service Provider, Tyvak International. First of all, the EES (Electro Explosive Subsystem) and the solid rocket motor were individually qualified. These qualification test programs were based on major safety standards, as the ECSS (European Cooperation for Space Standardization), the Military Standard (MIL-STD-1576) and the Eastern-Western Range (EWR 127-1), the SMC-S-016 and related standards. Secondly, the satellite Qualification Model was tested in an inert configuration, to optimize the program scheduling and minimize costs. Finally, the satellite Flight Model went through the acceptance test program, which was identified merging ground handling, transportation, safety, launcher and CubeSat International Standard requirements.
Spacecraft:
D-SAT is a nanosatellite designed on the 3U+ CubeSat standard with a mass < 4.5 kg. The satellite has been designed to maximize the reliability and consequently the mission success. Therefore D-SAT main functions are single point of failure free. Thanks to this valuable characteristic, D-SAT differs from the majority of current CubeSats and it may represent an innovative design model in the nanosatellite development.
Figure 2: Illustration of the D-SAT 3U CubeSat (image credit: D-Orbit)
D-SAT spacecraft is constituted by two identical units, called Unit 1 and Unit 2 (Figure 3). In cruise conditions, Unit 1 acts as "Master", which plays the role of the CubeSat platform, while the Unit 2 acts as "Slave", playing the role of the satellite payload.
In nominal operation the Unit 1 carries on all typical features of a platform; it is responsible of housekeeping, ADCS (Attitude Determination and Control Subsystem), energy charging and power distribution and radio communication with ground. In the meantime, the Unit 2 acts as "Slave", playing the role of the Unit deputed to the decommissioning function. Before the decommissioning phase, the control is transitioned to the Slave Unit, which provides a maneuver-suitable attitude, a stabilizing spin motion and finally the deorbiting maneuver.
Figure 3: D-SAT block diagram (image credit: D-Orbit)
Both Units interface with the EES (Electro Explosive System) and the motor, thus if needed they are both fully capable to assume the role of Master or Slave. Thanks to the D-SAT architecture, the decommissioning function, consisting of a quick, reliable and safe deorbiting of the D-SAT spacecraft, is possible even if one of the two units is malfunctioning or dead.
The D-SAT nanosatellite includes the following components:
• 2 CubeSat-class systems, called Unit 1 and Unit 2, each containing:
- one on board computer OBC
- one interface board
- one S-band antenna
- one UHF radio module
- AOCS actuators (magnetorquers) and sensors (magnetometers, sun sensors, gyroscope)
- one EPS (Electric Power Subsystem) including batteries and solar arrays.
• A GPS receiver to accurately track the reentry trajectory after the decommissioning maneuver
• A spin wheel to impart angular momentum about the z-axis of the satellite, for passive stability during fire
• An EES comprehensive of the EED, the electric "Firing Circuit" and mechanical "Safe and Arm Device" part
• A solid propellant motor.
As of June 2016, the QM (Qualification Model) is now subjected to the qualification tests following the Launch Service Provider requirements (Figure 4).

Mission status:
• October 10, 2017: The. 18) 19)
- D-Sat has concluded its mission, proving that D-Orbit Decommissioning Device (D3) is a flight-ready technology that can be integrated into the next-generation satellites. All subsystems, onboard sensors, and actuators have been working perfectly throughout the mission, and all three experiments — DeCAS, Atmosphere Analyzer, and SatAlert — produced remarkable scientific contributions.
- In D-Sat's design for redundancy, critical software, manufacturing, flawless orbital performance, and flight-worthiness of D3, we have achieved most of our mission's key objectives: the goal of a direct and controlled decommissioning, however, was not achieved.
- According to a preliminary analysis, the cause for the missed reentry of the satellite is related to the interface between the D3 and the small satellite: the alignment of the motor with the spacecraft's center of gravity resulted to be outside the designed tolerance. While we had put in place strategies to mitigate this outcome, we knew we had little margin to play with considering that the D3 installed onboard was designed for satellites one order of magnitude bigger.
- As in any space mission we had to make a tradeoff that included a calculated risk, i.e. by not installing a thrust vector control for the solid propellant motor because it would have been not suitable for the volume available in such a small satellite. The same D3 installed into a bigger satellite would allow a sufficiently reasonable misalignment tolerance between the motor and the spacecraft's center of gravity. The adoption of a thrust vector control will also remove the tolerance issue.
• August 2017: The mission is going well. The satellite is responding nominally to all commands and is performing right now two of the three independent experiments we have carried on board, the SatAlert experiment and the DeCas experiment. The D-Orbit Ground Control Team is performing several activities in preparation of the decommissioning maneuver: the demonstration of a controlled re-entry, executed by D-Orbit's proprietary autonomous decommissioning device based on solid rocket propulsion, is the main objective of the D-SAT mission. In the meantime, while in orbit, the Ground Control Team is periodically taking pictures of Earth from Space. 20) 21)

D-SAT Test Campaigns:
D-SAT Test philosophy: D-SAT FM (Flight Model) baseline acceptance test plan at satellite level consists of a set of acceptance tests performed in the spacecraft inert configuration, meaning that, inside the EES and the SRM (Solid Rocket Motor), the hazardous materials have been substituted with equivalent inert materials (Figure 8); the EES contains an Electro Explosive Device not containing explosive powder and similarly the SRM contains an inert initiator powder and inert propellant cartridge.
Figure 8: D-SAT inert EES and SRM subsystems (image credit: D-Orbit)
The test and integration approach with hazardous subsystems is reported in the block diagram of Figure 9. The test consist of random and sine vibration compliant with the launcher user guide and thermal vacuum basing on SMC Standard SMC-S-016 . After the tests, D-SAT is partially disassembled to integrate the Flight subsystems previously accepted at subsystem level. After reassembling D-SAT, a functional test is performed to verify a correct integration. Finally, D-SAT integration in the P-POD and functional tests after integration are performed. 22) 23)
Figure 9: D-SAT FM acceptance approach (image credit: D-Orbit)
EES (Electro Explosive Subsystem): An EES, designed with a SRM (Solid Rocket Motor) directly integrated with an igniter, EED (Electro Explosive Device), shall be controlled with a dedicated system that integrates several inhibits. With a deep investigation on the common standard related to EESs is clear that the most used standard is MIL-STD-1576, which was written in 1984, but always used. The MIL-STD-1576 lists several requirements on EES design for space application (manned mission or not) and many of these are focused on the safety aspect. The main functions of the EES are:
• Avoid an inadvertent ignition of the EED – 4 electrical inhibits: 3 controlled by command and 1 based on pyrotechnical chain status
• Avoid the ignition of SRM caused by an inadvertent ignition of the EED
• Monitoring of the state of the EES (safe state of arm state)
• Contain the gas generated by an inadvertent ignition of the EED.
Test Philosophy and tests performed: The test plan is a tailoring of SMC-S-016 and MIL-STD-1576. The tailoring was done in order to be compliant with cost and time schedule imposed by a typical CubeSat mission. The strategy in the tailoring is based on performing the most critical tests on the single critical components, the EED. The testing phase is composed by two sequential phases (design verification and qualification), for each of these are foreseen: environmental tests (thermal and vibration) and fire tests integrated with the motor, in order to demonstrate the full functionality of the EES directly with the SRM:
• Fire test – The coordination between D-Orbit and Bayern Chemie teams allowed to perform the fire tests integrated with SRM during its design verification/qualification path:
- 1° phase – during design verification, the pyrotechnical chain, that connect the EED with the SRM, was tested to high and low temperature (-30°C and +71°C) directly with the SRM
- 2° phase – during qualification, the assembly of pyrotechnical chain, the EED and the firing circuit was tested on the SRM at high and low temperature (-34°C and +71°C).
The tested unit are in inert configuration, with an inert EED; this is necessary for programmatic constraints (budget and scheduling). The EED is already subject to a qualification program performed by the manufacturer.
Each produced unit is subject to an acceptance test program:
• Functional test after production – Inert configuration
• Environment test (random vibration and thermal cycle) – Inert configuration
• Integration of EED and functional test.
Each EED is subject to its own acceptance program performed by the manufacturer.
Design verification program: The design verification program is executed in order to acquire confidence on the EES design. The tailoring of the test program is based on standards SMC-S-016, MIL-STD-1576 and EWR-127-1 satisfying budget constraints and the worst-case approach on test levels. The firing tests are executed with a reduced version of EES, in order to replicate the pyrotechnical chain. In these tests, D-Orbit verified the functionality of the chain EES+SRM+EED at low and high.
Test Results: The test executed on EES had positive results. The firing tests executed during the verification and qualification of SRM had positive results; all EES produced had passed the acceptance test.
D-SAT transportation: The transport of the D-SAT spacecraft presented some issues related to the included components and the classification of the device. The transportation of the satellite requires asking a formal evaluation to the European body in relation to classification products, i.e. Bundesanstalt für Materialforschung und -prüfung (BAM). Another issue related to the transport is regarding the authorizations needed to export the device from the European Union. The needed authorization and declarations are associated to the TARIC (Integrated Community Tariff) code. All the listed documents have to be collected and presented to the customs.
The actual transportation of the D-SAT spacecraft is assigned to an international forwarder with expertise in transport of space application devices.
Experiments: (SatAlert, DeCAS, DAA)
During its mission, together with the Decommissioning Device In-Orbit Demonstration, D-SAT will host different scientific experiments: in the cruise phase, D-SAT will carry out the "SatAlert" experiment, developed together with the CNIT (Consorzio Nazionale Interuniversitario per le Telecomunicazioni) and after the fire, during the reentry trajectory through the atmosphere, the DeCAS and the Atmo-Analyzer experiments will be performed (Ref. 3).
SatAlert Experiment
When a disaster happens, the delivery of alerts to the population is a key element to prevent tragic consequences and increase the efficiency of the planned reaction to the event. The SatAlert Experiment is a part of the standardization activity devoted to the definition of MAMES (Multiple Alert Message Encapsulation protocol over Satellite) for the delivery of alerts to the population in the case of a disaster. The MAMES main objective is the definition of an extensible multiple alert message encapsulation protocol for alert messages transport over satellite links. In particular MAMES provides a means for encapsulating one or more differently formatted alert messages [e.g. CAP (Common Alert Protocol) , unstructured text, image, paging protocols, DeCAS messages]. 24)
The SatAlert experiment aims to verify the transmission setup of MAMES messages from the MAMES Alert Provider to the MAMES Alert Receiver. The experiment consists in the generation and transmission of a MAMES ALERT message, from an Earth station to satellite, which will process and broadcast the received message back to Earth. In order to validate the process, two separate Earth stations for satellite beacon tracking will be implemented. The main ground station will be located in Lomazzo (Italy) at D-Orbit's premise and it will be responsible for the generation and transmission of the MAMES Messages and also for the reception and decapsulation of them; while a second ground station located in Florence (Italy) will only receive and decapsulate MAMES messages (Figure 10).

DeCAS (Debris Collision Alerting System) Experiment
In Earth's orbit, there are about 13,000 objects. For most of them, the disposal will be through the reentry into the atmosphere as required by international agreements between agencies in different countries. (i.e NASA Safety Standard 8719.14 - Process for Limiting Orbital Debris, Ref. 24). With the new satellite technologies and the advent of space tourism, SV reentries in the atmosphere are expected to rise considerably over the next few years. Today we are forced to close airspace supposedly concerned with these reentries (with strong economic impact) and to live moments of uncertainty and apprehension. The fragmentation of a space vehicle (satellite or spacecraft) during reentry to the Earth can be planned or accidental, as in the case of Columbia. The debris that is generated, whose position is always uncertain, can be very dangerous to the population and to high-risk industrial plants (i.e. nuclear power plants) and to the civil and military aviation (a fragment more than 300 gr causes loss of aircraft). Knowing the location and the extent of the debris (or danger area), as well as its dynamics, allows to secure and notify all potentially interested parties in time. This leads to a need for aerospace safety of a system able to determine the exact condition of explosion / fragmentation of Space Vehicle and to send an early warning to the users potentially affected by transmitting the dynamics of Danger Area to all interested users and providing the elements to "suggest" to pilots an initial escape heading to avoid danger area.
The patented DeCAS device is small in size and lightweight based on the principle of the black box of the aircraft and it uses space technologies already tested for data broadcasting. It works as a "smart fragment" which can autonomously determine its own position during reentry and which knows its relative location in the projected hazard area which has been pre-computed on ground and/or its data are used directly from a ground station to determine the Dangerous Area. It is fitted into or on the vehicle during the construction phase remaining in a dormant status until it activates by itself at the moment of fragmentation of space vehicle sending information about its location (which corresponds to the space debris area). - Hence the DeCAS system aims to inform both the air traffic and the population of an imminent danger due to the fall of space debris caused by controlled or uncontrolled reentry of the space vehicle on which it is mounted. It is useful both in the launch phase (detachment and reentry of the various stages of combustion) and in the reentry phase.
The D-SAT mission will have the capability of the DeCAS system on board, thus allowing the latter to make its first in-orbit validation test. With D-SAT in orbit, an uncontrolled re-entry will be simulated by sending to D-SAT a trigger message which in turn will generate a message towards the ground with the necessary parameters to define its footprint. Once the message is received by the ground stations, it will be processed by a special software, which will calculate the position of the footprint and will make a prediction of the time and the area of impact on the ground.
Once the danger area will be defined, the DeCAS message will be encapsulated, uploaded to the satellite and broadcasted to ground by the MAMES protocol. This second phase has the aim to verify the possibility of using an emergency protocol for the transmission of DeCAS messages that allows their validation and authenticity.
The third aim of this mission is to simulate a network of ground stations able to receive the signal, process it and transmit the information to all potential customers and agencies. To achieve this purpose, Aviosonic has partnered with companies and government agencies, which will provide facilities capable of receiving the signal and process it with the software that will be provided to them. The success of D-SAT mission is fundamental for Aviosonic because it will open the way to the second phase of the system development and to the drawing-up of preliminary agreements for its marketing.
Atmo-Analyzer Experiment
DAA (D-Orbit Atmosphere Analyzer), also referred to as Atmo-Analyzer Experiment, is a sensor developed by D-Orbit able to analyze and retrieve atmospheric data during its reentry through the atmosphere and send them to specific fixed or mobile ground stations. During the reentry phase, DAA will retrieve atmospheric data during the satellite descent, and post processing analysis of the raw data will produce valuable data for customers. Among the main users for DAA data will be insurance companies, weather agencies and telecommunication companies that are interested in measuring scientific data in the MLT (Mesosphere and Lower Thermosphere) region. The DAA major competitive advantage is the type and quality of data collected. DAA is being developed in the scope of the European Space Agency's Business Incubation Center (ESA BIC) in Portugal and has been granted SME (Small and Medium sized manufacturing Enterprise) Instrument Phase 1 from the European Commission, benefiting from both business and technical support. In this first version, DAA will measure temperature, GPS signal and the magnetic field during D-SAT descend towards Earth.

What is Dupuytrens contracture?
Dupuytrens contracture is a disorder of the fingers most commonly affecting the little or ring finger, sometimes both and usually in both hands.
What causes Dupuytrens contracture?
The exact cause of Dupuytrens contracture is unknown. Genetics has been shown to be the most common factor as up to 70% of people that develop Dupuytrens contracture have a history of the condition within the family.
What are the symptoms of Dupuytrens contracture?
Normally we are able to control when we bend our fingers and by how much. This hand control is lost with Dupuytrens contracture and more so as the condition progresses and the palmar fascia tightens.
Small nodules which are thickening of connective tissue on the palm side of your hand make it hard to straighten your finger and it may be tender to touch.
As the condition progresses, your fingers may be pulled into a permanently bent position, making even simple activities difficult to do such as dressing, cooking or swimming.
How is Dupuytrens contracture diagnosed?
Your physiotherapist can carry out a full assessment of your wrist and hand and following this be able to diagnose Dupuytrens contracture by assessing the fascia in the palm of your hand, if there are any nodules present and your range of movement.
You may be referred to a specialist to track the progress of the condition and may require surgery if it starts to significantly debilitate you.
What treatment can Farrell Physiotherapy offer for Dupuytrens contracture?
Dupuytrens contracture can be managed both conservatively and surgically depending on the severity of the contracture. Physiotherapy is an effective treatment for both types of management as in the conservative stages can help preserve movement and slow the contracture.
Following an assessment, your physiotherapist will create a treatment plan for you based around their findings. There are many different treatment options for Dupuytrens contracture youre your physiotherapist will choose the most beneficial methods of treatment based on your symptoms and response to different treatments.
Treatment may include:
- Joint mobilisation
- Passive range of movement exercises
- Active range of movement exercises
- Active-assisted range of movement exercises
- Soft tissue massage to relieve any pain and stiffness
Benefit of physiotherapy for Dupuytrens contracture?
There are several benefits of physiotherapy for Dupuytrens contracture with the aim being to reduce your symptoms and have your hand function as best as possible in the shortest space of time. The particular benefits you feel from physiotherapy will depend on your original symptoms and treatment goals.
Some of the benefits of physiotherapy include:
- Reduced pain
- Reduced stiffness
- Improved dexterity and co-ordination
- Improved grip strength
- Improved function
- Reduced scarring
- Decreased risk of permanent contracture

The.Manchester artist Dámì Sule previously came to our attention with his soulful oeuvre, ‘Crayons’. Last Friday he released the ten track album Rough Canvas, which is comprised of sounds from neo-soul, jazz and hip-hop and speaks to themes of love, faith and the timeless search for freedom. First track ‘Heartbeat’ starts of the tape slowly and Dámì Sule’s textured voice rides the minimalist beat with ease. He uses the song as his painting to pour out his emotion over the sultry production.
‘You Don’t Have to Cry’ is next up and this neo-soul boom-bap beat is layered with goosebump inducing piano keys. His earthy voice is soothing, as he croons comforting words to a love interest. We then get to ‘Prayer’, which serves as the lead single for the tape. The track sounds Erykah Baduesque, but Dámì Sule does it justice with a poetic prayer over jazzy keyboard synths. I can fully understand why the song is called ‘Prayer’, as it transports me to a heavenly state.
‘Show Me Love’ keeps me on this celestial plane and he flows over the delicate hip-hop track with effortless ease. He continues proceedings with ‘Phone Call Away’, delivering a spirited monologue about the ideological separation he has from his parents. They want him to go down the traditional university, distinguished job path. But music is Dámì’s calling.
He then switches up the vibe with ‘Acting New’, an Inspector Morse like trap thumper layered with dystopian harp synths, which he laces with a confident freestyle centered on a love interest “acting brand new”. The theme of breaking free runs through the album and he continues this with ‘Chains’. On this one he rides a bed of disjointed violin strings, which mirror his choppy rap about being chained. He wants to break free of society’s chains and he delivers this plea with a spirited performance.
He continues the uplifting rhetoric with ‘Young Black and African’, a track which resonates with me, as I am all of the above. A song like this is essential in this era where dark skinned women have been thrown under the bus, when in reality they need to be put on a pedestal. We then get to ‘Power’ which is aptly named, as the snickering snare sits atop an empowering piano riff. The song makes you ponder over life’s wonders and dream of a better tomorrow with its angelic aura.
‘No One Cares’ serves as the album closer and with it he continues the theme of feeling disenfranchised, chanting “They don’t care about me”- a mantra for the marginalized. Dámì Sule tells us “the whole idea of Rough Canvas is about portraying everything perfect yet imperfect. It is about finding your flaws and making it a canvas for everything beautiful to be made. Rough Canvas is all in the name- “rough”- to show the unfiltered, raw and often unappreciated struggles of a young black boy”.

Darwin’s Theory
1. Darwin’s Theory
2. Charles Robert DarwinCharles Robert Darwin (12
February 1809 – 19 April
1882) was an English
naturalist. He established
that all species of life have
descended over time from
common ancestors, and
proposed the scientific
theory that explains that this
branching pattern of
evolution, resulted from a
process that he called
natural selection.
3. Darwin published his theory with some evidence for evolution in his book “On the Origin of Species”, overcoming scientificDarwin published his theory with
some evidence for evolution in his
book “On the Origin of Species”,
overcoming scientific rejection of
earlier concepts of transmutation of
species. By the 1870s the scientific
community and much of the general
public had accepted evolution as a
fact.
4. However, many favoured competing explanations and it was not until the emergence of the modern evolutionary synthesis from theHowever,.
5. The journey on the BeagleThe Beagle was a ship used for a cartographic consignment of five years, around
the coasts of South America. When Darwin was young, he was recommended to
Robert Fitzrov, the captain of this ship.
6. The possibility of working, during the journey directly on the field, allowed him to study the geological characteristics ofcontinents, islands, and a lot of
organisms and fossils. He
collected methodically a large
amount of samples, unknown to
science: this samples, were
given to British Museum, and
only those samples were an
enormous scientific
contribution.
7. Thanks to those studies Darwin began detailed investigations and in 1838 conceived his theory of natural selection. Although heThanks to those studies.
8. Darwin’s WorkDar.
9. How Darwin conceived his ideaHe based his theory on fourth different evidences
Direct Observation
Biogeography
Fossils
Homologous Structures
10. Direct Observation
11. The first evidence is the direct observation. The first object of his interest were the artificial selection. He talked a lotabout
the intersection of pigeons: in order to obtain a thinner beak or
larger wings. In general, the artificial selection, is the selection
operated by man. Voluntary (like the intersection between
species) or not.
12. To explain the second case, we could talk about the Biston Betularia.
13. Biston betularia is a white moth, which lives in Manchester. In the '800 a lot of factories were born in this territory.Slowly the white
moth was
replaced by the
black moth.
14. Why? Because the trees, contaminated by smokes, had become black, and the white moth, resting on these trees, became targetsfor the raiders,
and because of the contrast it
couldn't camouflage. Slowly the
darkest moth replaced the
clearest one, until the clear ones
disappeared. When an animal
changes its colour to camouflage
because of any change in the
environment or because of the
humans, we talk about industrial
melanism.
15. BiogeographyThe second evidence is
biogeography. Darwin had
noticed that in the same area,
there were different types of
creatures and species.
Biogeography was the weapon
to destroy the idea of
creationism. But the numerous
examples of different species
in the same area, were only a
support to the evolution
theory: every single animal is
different, because they have
different needs, and different
ways of surviving.
16. Fossils
17. The third evidence were fossils. During his journey on the Beagle, Darwin studied a lot of them. He discovered a substantialdifference between ancestral
creatures and modern ones. Unfortunately,
this wasn’t enough, because nothing
proved a gradual changing from a primitive
form. For this reason Darwin described this
evidence as “little remarkable”.
18. Homologous StructuresThe fourth evidence was the discover of a homologous structure that was shared by
every single creature on Earth. The same starting DNA sequence shows us the
common origin of the species.
As we can see in the image,
different creatures share the
same basic structure. This
structure was particular of an
animal called ancestral
tetrapode, or more precisely
Silvanerpeton Miripedes.
19. An Incompleted TheoryDarwin lacked of
precision, and in his
theory he didn’t explain
the origin of the
variation that permitted
the evolution, but for
that we have to wait
until the XX century,
when Mendel would
analyse this matter.Democratic presidential candidate former Vice President Joe Biden removes his face mask to speak at The Queen theater, Thursday, Nov. 5, 2020, in Wilmington, Del. (AP Photo/Carolyn Kaster)Carolyn Kaster / Associated Press

Everybody suddenly becomes an expert on job searching and they all have an opinion about what you should be doing. While all of this advice is well-intentioned, not all of it is useful. Here is some advice that it is best to politely ignore:
“Send out 25 applications each day.” Some people ascribe to the ‘spray and pray’ method of job searching. They believe that if you apply to a whole whack of companies, sooner or later one will call you back. This is not an effective way to find a job. When you are applying to such a high number of positions, you are not able to customize your application to each individual job. As a result, you just end up sending out a lot of weak applications and the employers respond accordingly.
“Never settle.” Sure, you have an idea of what type of job you want and how much you want to get paid. The problem is that sometimes your goals may not be in line with the current labour market conditions. When that is the case, it is essential that you be flexible, otherwise you could be job hunting for a long time. You may need to settle for a less-than-perfect job in the short term in order to set yourself up to get your dream job in the future.
“Just walk in the door and ask for a job.” A few decades ago, the best way to find a job was to go knocking on doors. While this may still be true if you’re applying for a job at a small business, for the most part, it is an outdated approach. The Internet has changed job searching dramatically. Most companies prefer for you to e-mail your resume, and many require you to register on their own career site. Usually, if you just drop in to the office to talk to the manager, you will get screened out by the receptionist or referred to the website.
“Collect letters of reference from your past employers.” This is another strategy that belongs in the past. These days, letters of reference are not worth the paper that they are written on. Employers need to speak to your references directly so that they can ensure that they are real and they can ask specific questions. A better approach is to ask your managers for their contact information and request permission to pass it on to prospective employers.
“Don’t worry about the cover letter.” Some people say that job seekers shouldn’t bother too much with the cover letter because employers don’t read it anyway. The problem is that while the statement is true for some employers, other employers do read and consider it when they are evaluating the applicants. The problem is that you never know when or where it will be important. Even within the same company, the human resource manager may ignore it, while the hiring manager reads every word. The safest approach is to make sure that everything that you submit presents you as a qualified and professional candidate.
Everyone has had to look for a job at some point in their life, so when you’re a job seeker, lots of people are eager to share their experiences. It’s a good idea to keep an open mind because you never know where you’ll find a great job lead. However, if the advice that you’re hearing sounds a little bit ridiculous, then just say thank you and move on.

Something told me not. Yes, the retaining wall and railings were freshly painted and to be fair it was nice and tidy everywhere thanks to the sterling efforts of keen volunteers, but that wasn’t it. I got out of the car and looked again. A faint sweet smell reminiscent of freshly mown grass brushed past on the breeze. Speedy’s been in early again, I thought, but that wasn’t it either. Yes, there was a faint smell but subtlety different from mown grass.
For some reason I closed my eyes and took a deep breath and that sweet smell suddenly made sense. As clear as day I saw an image I have played over and over in my mind’s eye. Mills with the corner, Beckford with the flick on and Robbie Earle thundering into the box to head home. Promotion was won.
I remember it so well, that day in early June 1989 and the excitement of winning promotion to the second tier. The jubilation, the anticipation of what was to come. The optimism. The penny dropped. That was it - the sense, the feeling, it was the faint sweet smell of optimism. And now 30 years later, almost to the day, that optimism was here again at Vale Park.
I stood there for a moment and tried to take it all in. The sun broke through the clouds and as the grey began to lift, caution took hold and I tried to calm down. If over 50 years of watching my beloved Vale has taught me anything, I know that when you expect too much your hopes are likely to be dashed.
We might have wonderful new owners and a down to earth manager who wants to instil hard work and belief into his players but there’s no simple panacea for a club that has suffered the decline we have witnessed through the various regimes of the last 10 years or so. Sweet smell there might be but the acrid blue mist that descended upon us during the last few years and managed to hang around for far too long, affecting everyone and everything that it came into contact with, will take a while yet to completely dissipate.
Please accept that the omens are good. Carol and Kevin are pretty much everything that the previous owner wasn’t. In a good way. But return for a moment to that balmy evening back in June ’89 when promotion was won and John Rudge instinctively knew that was not the end of his hard work, merely the beginning of it. So it is for Carol and Kevin who must realise that having won the unnecessarily tortuous battle to own the club outright, it’s now that the hard work starts and the task of turning things around at Port Vale begins in earnest.
There is clearly much to do but if the smiles on the faces of everyone at the club are anything to go by the start has been a positive one. Season Ticket sales already exceed 4000 and the squad is certainly taking a better more balanced shape. We shouldn’t expect miracles, though. Maybe just hope for better:
Better engagement with the supporters
Better financial control
Better organisation
Better links with local community and businesses
Better….
I could go on with a list of things that need improvement, which I’m confident that Carol and Kevin can influence and manage properly. However, despite their undoubted business acumen they have never run a football club before and that is going to be a huge learning curve. I’m sure that they will improve so many aspects of the organisation and business side of the club but it’s on the pitch that counts the most and that is the biggest challenge of all.
A better team yielding better results is a must. Not just to see us sitting higher in the table but because it makes critically important off-field revenue such as sponsorship and general commercial activity so much easier to realise. If the intention is to plough some of this income back into the club through additional team strengthening, the long term future should be further enhanced.
So is it so far so good? Most supporters I have spoken with share my feelings and seem happy, encouraged and needless to say, optimistic. You can’t really ask for much more at this stage. The past few weeks since the takeover have been inspiring and certainly my own optimism is far greater than the usual pre-season anticpation when you can’t wait for the games to start again. Yet at the same time this optimism is tempered by the belief that recovery to where we should be as a football club is going to take time.
Like all Vale supporters I want better and I believe that we deserve better. For me, whilst improvements in organisation and off field management will be as welcome as they are necessary, better will be crucially defined by progress on the field of play, no matter how small. To be honest the bar has been set quite low in the last few seasons so, in that sense, better should not be too difficult to achieve.
Did we make progress under Bell and Rudge in the 90s? You bet we did. Will the Shanahans and Askey ride this resurgent wave of optimism to provide us with a repeat of the kind of exciting football and supporter satisfaction that we witnessed back then? I certainly hope so.
Don’t bank on it though and don’t expect too much too soon. Instead look for positive steps, no matter how small and be prepared for setbacks. Unfortunately, they are inevitable. We had a few setbacks in the 90s, but generally overcame them quite well. Progress will demand that our new owners can do the same. The sensible, logical and business-like approach they are demonstrating should surely stand the club in good stead in this respect.
In any event I’ll be back with regular monthly updates throughout the season to examine how all things Port Vale are going and discuss once again “What do you think of it so far?”

Melting and breakup would not be surprising, given the berg’s long journey and northerly location. A previous image showed B-15Z farther south in October 2017, after it had ridden the coastal countercurrent about three-quarters of the way around Antarctica bringing it to the Southern Ocean off the tip of the Antarctic Peninsula.
Currents prevented the berg from continuing through the Drake Passage; instead, B-15Z cruised north into the southern Atlantic Ocean. When the May 2018 photograph was acquired, the berg was about 150 nautical miles northwest of the South Georgia islands. Icebergs that make it this far have been known to rapidly melt and end their life cycles here.
As NASA glaciologist Kelly Brunt previously noted about icebergs this close to the equator: “They tend to pond with water, which then works its way through the iceberg like a set of knives.”
Astronaut photograph ISS055-E-74583 was acquired on May 22, 2018, with a Nikon D4 digital camera using an 200 map by Joshua Stevens, using data from the Antarctic Iceberg Tracking Database.

Although the demand for honey jackfruits in the local and overseas markets is high as it tastes yummy and sweet, jackfruit browning has reduced harvests by 30% each year.
Among the benefits that one gets from consuming jackfruits are that it helps to lower blood pressure and improve blood circulation in the body. It is also rich in vitamins A and C (anti-oxidant) and helps to strengthen the immune system against diseases, plus maintaining healthy eyes and skin.
In an attempt to overcome the problem of browning, a company that plants jackfruits in its plantation, KMT Group, has engaged researchers of University Putra Malaysia (UPM) to review and take some samples of fruits, leaves, barks and soils for analysis.

Joshua walked towards church grounds, his brow drenched in the salty water called sweat and his body sheding crimson tears. While walking through the island, he was brutally outnumbered by rouge mutants. He fought them all off but this time he wasn't so lucky and couldn't come out unscathed. The hospital was too far off and he needed to rest. If he walked more he feared the cold break of death and that wasn't something he was going to accept. He took in large breaths and he slumped to the ground and blood and sweat began to become one liquid all together.

Two weeks of heat, rest and re-energizing has been the perfect way to finish 2015 and start the new year. Also time to reflect on the racing in Canada over the past month.
We arrived into Canada with the snow so the first series of NorAm races at Lake Louise (downhill for Willis) were disrupted along with the Super G being cancelled. We headed on down to Panorama to continue the NorAms starting with Super G, GS then slalom. This series was one of those learning curves for me with expectations, pressure and goals focus instead of taking it each run at a time. While I had some good runs (3rd fastest time in the second run GS) and the second slalom run, I did not perform as well as I would have liked.
After the NorAm races we had a Tech series, also at Panorama. Unfortunately in the first GS run I was DNF (fastest time at the first interval so skiing better) but day two I put together two good runs to take out top podium spot. First day of the slalom I made a few errors both runs but managed to come in at second place. They were all long days with a large field of athletes (140 each day) and quite a few delays. We missed day two of the slalom as had a flight to catch in Calgary. I was happy to get points results for both slalom and giant slalom over the past two months with a 15 point result in each. I start the new year in Europe with 16.45 for giant slalom and 18.36 in slalom.Winchester Art Market This Sunday 18th August

Add a comment:The latin name for a Quoll is Dasyurus which translates as ‘hairy-tail’. Quolls are known as the ‘native cat’ to Australia and New Guinea. They are known as this because, from a distance, they bare a striking resemblance to a cat. They are usually found in woodland and grassland. They can climb trees, jump extraordinary distances and are usually found patrolling the ground below trees and in and around bushes. In total there are 6 species of Quoll, each ranging in size and weight. The largest, the Tiger Quoll, can weigh as much as 18 lbs. They are known for their carnivorous diet; eating small mammals and birds. In fact, the Tiger Quoll is one of the largest carnivorous marsupial in the world!
Being a marsupial, a Quoll has a pouch in which they carry their young. However, the Quoll is a little strange in that they have a pouch which is found on the back of the animal. The pouch is also not always visible and is only revealed when the female becomes pregnant. The pouch develops from folds in the female’s abdomen and becomes pronounced on the exterior back of the animal. The actual act of ‘doing the deed’ is a rather violent one. For example, in the Northern Quoll species, the females all come into heat at the same time. This means that a mass ‘free for all’ takes place amongst the males. A ‘successful’ male is one who is able to grab the neck of a female between its jaws and drag her away to a place in which to reproduce in. This ‘ordeal’ usually takes place for 3 or so hours but can take place for the entire day!
It is rather easy to identify whether or not a male and a female are ready to breed; if the two are found in the same area, then they are ready to reproduce! This is because the Quoll genders are almost exclusively solitary. They very rarely meet up and when they do, the reason for their meeting is to have sex. Bizarrely, the only other time a male and a female Quoll may meet up is to go to the bathroom. Quolls often ‘build’ large, communal toilet areas. The toilets, like latrines in trenches, are dug into the ground and are shared by all the Quolls in a particular territory. These group toilets can contain well over 100 separate droppings and more latrines are always being dug up for further use.
Many of the Quolls are endangered. One of the reasons for this is the introduction of invasive species into the habitats. For example, the Cane Toad (which was introduced in 1935), are extremely poisonous and have caused the death of many Eastern Quolls who have eaten them. Another invasive species is the fox. The fox not only competes with the Quolls for food like rabbits, they also prey upon the Quolls when the food supply is limited. The Quolls are also seen as ‘evolutionary backwards’ in some of their behaviours and traits. For example, the Northern Quoll have been shown to be unable to distinguish the mating call of its own species. Not only that, but they have been unable to distinguish between the call of a fox and the call of a cow!
Further, the Northern Quoll, despite producing upwards of 30 young in one birth, only has 6 nipples and therefore can only support 6 children. This means that it is only the first 6 to the mother who will survive. The final downfall of the Quoll is that it seems to have a tendency towards suicidal behaviour. It has been noted in many parts of Australia that Quolls have created their communal bathrooms in the middle of busy roads and freeways. This means that any of the Quolls who wish to use the toilet must do exceedingly quickly, or they risk becoming roadkill! I think I’m rather glad that I’m not Quoll: having foxes chase me, eating horrible toads and being chased by cars whenever I need the toilet seems like a rather stressful lifestyle!We are often asked which Library of Congress primary source is our favorite. We could never choose just one, but this week Lee Ann Potter, Director of Educational Outreach at the Library of Congress, highlights an especially intriguing or engaging primary source from the Library’s online collections.
My “favorite” primary source . . . well, one of them, anyway.
On May 13, 1900, using stationery of the Wright Cycle Company, Wilbur Wright handwrote a letter to fellow aviation pioneer Octave Chanute of Chicago, Illinois. I love this 5 page letter!
It contains some of the very best human emotions–passion, optimism, tenacity, curiosity, and recognition that together we can solve big problems.
Wright began by explaining, .”
Later in the letter, he emphatically stated his belief that manned flight was attainable. “It is possible to fly without motors, but not without knowledge and skill,” he explained. He further declared that flight pioneers needed to share insights and successes, “The problem is too great for one man alone and unaided to solve in secret.” And he argued that sharing would cause them no financial harm, since he believed it was unlikely that the inventor of the first flying machine would make a profit. Lastly, Wright described his planned training regimen and requested Chanute’s advice on geographical locations with strong wind velocities and other attributes needed in a test site.
This letter is one of several hundred exchanged between Chanute and the Wright brothers, touching on every phase and stage of aeronautical development between 1900 and 1910. Since the Wrights generally kept no copies of their outgoing letters, researchers are indebted to Chanute, who saved virtually everything he received from the brothers who were credited with successfully making the first controlled, powered, and sustained heavier-than-air human flight, on December 17, 1903. Check out the Wilbur and Orville Wright Papers at the Library of Congress for more!
We featured this letter in a “Right to the Source” article, published in the December 2014 issue of The Science Teacher journal of the National Science Teachers Association (NSTA).

I enjoyed reading this letter–it inspired me to explore the history and read more of letters between Wright and Chanute. As a teacher, I hope to find primary sources to use in my classroom that will encourage students to do the same– to peak their interest in a topic and inspire them to look beyond their textbooks.

Cheating is always a hotly debated and contested area when we are talking about relationships. But to address infidelity would mean addressing a root cause. To think of a thought process that might birth the idea of infidelity, we can look at this concept: Is the grass greener on the other side?
This thought alone often gets us into trouble. We see something that invokes our senses, and invigorates our excitement. But didn’t mom or grandma always say everything that looks good ain’t always good? We don’t think about that at the time though.
When people start looking for fulfillment in different areas, it is because something at home may be lacking. There could be a number of different things that could be happening, because relationships have a lot of moving parts, and sometimes we lose track of some of those parts. Complacency is the main factor that contributes to this loss of track. We get comfortable in our current relationships, or we start slacking in our relationships over time, and being “happy” or “comfortable” becomes the norm.
We think we are safe and our partner won’t go seeking someone else because we have so many years in, or we have kids in, or whatever other reason we can come up with in our minds why they just wouldn’t do it. But people suffer silently lots of times without communicating what’s bothering them. Or they have communicated it, and no changes have been made over time.
Over time, when our partners slack, we seek fulfillment in other areas, and that’s when the question arises in our mind, “Is the grass greener?” Is this other person that has invigorated my senses and sparked my interest better than what I have at home? Often times they are not. But because of the current state of our relationship, we consider it, and even enjoy it.
It’s exciting to get those butterflies again. It’s exciting to feel wanted, appreciated, and loved. Everyone wants to feel like they’re needed in their partner’s life. When someone else comes along and provides that spark, we start to question what we have at home, instead of hashing those issues out. Everything starts to look like we’ve been wasting our time, and it starts a downward spiral. At the end of that downward spiral is the act of infidelity, when things just spiral out of control.
I’ve mentioned that my books , these articles, and my courses are focused mostly on preventive maintenance of our relationships. And this is primarily why. We go through the motions, and we get to this point. This is where some of the tools I’ve already introduced to you are going to be so effective at noticing these things when they initially start happening.
I’ve mentioned it in my podcasts, in previous articles and blogs, don’t get complacent. I even wrote a whole article on 5 ways to prevent infidelity. I’ll recap for those of you who either didn’t get the chance to read it or you’ve forgotten. They are essential points in remembering what brought you to your partner in the first place.
- Don’t get complacent
- Have a QRA every 3 months- which helps communicate when things change or issues arise that you may not necessarily be aware of
- Work to stay in some kind of shape
- Make time for sex
- Don’t make excuses
To read more about the QRA (Quarterly Relationship Assessment) and other resources:Read the Blog: QRA
For a roundup of preventive maintenance tips to keep you from getting to this point, you can check out another article I’ve written, 11 Core Concepts to Relationship Building.
Something new and fresh is always a powerful temptation to overcome, especially if things have currently become stale or stagnant. There is no excuse for infidelity, but there also is no excuse for becoming complacent, lazy, or just plain neglectful. If you don’t play your role and do your part, you will either lose the person, or they will cheat and the two of you will have to work on rebuilding, forgiveness, and building up that trust again. And this is no easy process.
Is the grass really greener?
Now in some cases, there really are times where two people got together for the wrong reasons, and don’t belong together. Here are some of them.
- pressure from friends or family
- having children together out of wedlock
- being high school sweethearts
- feeling like you can’t find anyone better
- don’t really love the person
These previous situations often present us with conundrums we don’t consider until we are years in, and a couple children down the line. I know so many people who have gotten married only because they had children, and their families and the church members were pressing them so hard to tie the knot even though deep down, they knew they either should have waited, or that the person wasn’t who they truly needed or wanted to be with.
I know one woman who got married to her high school sweetheart, stayed married 10 years and got divorced because he cheated. She hadn’t known anyone else or experienced anything else. Things were sour for several years but they never talked about any of the problems that had been developing. Lot’s of people think that it’s so hard to find someone, they might as well settle for who they already have, even if they have a bum hand. None of these are reasons to get with a person and stay with them.
And here are some cases where you should definitely get out of your current situation:
- verbal abuse
- physical abuse
- constant cheating
- constant lying
The last thing I’ll say about this subject is if your partner has repeatedly asked you to work something out, and you haven’t heeded their requests, at some point, they are going to make that decision, and go see if the grass is really greener. Chances are if you have elected to ignore these requests, warnings and signs, they will feel like it is time to seek alternatives.
Make sure you are being diligent in your relationships. If you are diligent before any of this presents itself, it won’t even be a worry of yours. Don’t let the enemy come in and destroy what you’ve worked hard to build. The enemies are complacency, laziness, unwillingness to adjust or address issues your partner has requested of you, and thinking that you’re irreplaceable.
Practice the preventive maintenance tools I teach, and implement them to keep the foundation you built strong..LOUIS VUITTON Mink Fur Bag Charm Key ring Black Charm Excellent. This is a very valuable item. It is in a very beautiful state. If you have any questions please ask me.

THE old Marine Rescue building has been demolished and it's all systems go for Woolgoolga's new Surf Life Saving Club.
Compared to the old surf club, currently located just down the beach, the new $3.9 million club house will seem positively palatial.
But as surf club president Les Pepper points out a new club is overdue and it will mean much swifter response times at the beach which has seen a drowning and a number of close calls in recent months.
"All the rescue equipment will be in one spot. At the moment the jet ski is locked in a container behind the club but with all the equipment in one spot the response time will be much quicker,” he said.
The new club house will include an open area for functions and plans to use an old surf boat cut in two for the bar. There will also be a kiosk.
"It's a kiosk, not a cafe,” Les said.
The club house will continue to host Christmas carols on a new and improved deck.
Life member Neville Cleary explains that unlike many of the new surf clubs up and down the coast, members were keen to ensure the new facility would not compete with local businesses who have been so supportive.
"We don't want to turn around and put in a restaurant after they've been helping us for the last 30 years with donations and so on. The bottle shop has also been very good to us.” Mr Cleary said.
He is also looking forward to being able to improve response times at the beach and spoke of the impact drownings have on members.
"Along the coast we still have four missing people - one at Ballina, one here and those two backpackers at Port Macquarie. It really affects you,” he said.
The new club house will include multiple storage facilities for surf rescue equipment, a state-of-the-art patrol room, First Aid room, a public café, function and training rooms, kitchen, gymnasium and a function room.
The Federal Government contributed $1 million to the project and the State Government $2.7 million.May 27, 2020

104
- The Effect of Stress on Your Oral HealthLong-term stress can hurt your health. However, it doesn't affect just your physical and emotional health. It can be bad for your teeth and mouth, too. Keep in mind these six stress-related conditions that can affect your oral health—and ways to minimize or prevent them altogether.
- 1. Grinding Your TeethIf you grind your teeth, you probably do it while you sleep. It's a common oral health problem. It can cause headaches, a sore jaw, and damage to your teeth. Severe teeth grinding can cause loose teeth or even broken or lost teeth. Stress and anxiety are a major cause of teeth grinding. Meditation, counseling and exercise are some ways to reduce the stress that causes teeth grinding. Your dentist can also make you a tooth guard to wear at night.
- 2. TMJ DisorderT. Your dentist may suggest a soft diet, meditation, or an anti-anxiety medication.
- 3. Canker SoresIf you are like most people, you have suffered through occasional attacks of these painful and annoying mouth ulcers. Triggers include vitamin B deficiency and any type of mouth injury or irritation. Several studies now show that stress is another big trigger for canker sores. You may be able to reduce canker sores by reducing stress. If you still get a canker, your doctor or dentist may prescribe a gel or cream to relieve the pain.
- 4. Gum DiseaseStress makes it harder for your body to fight off infections. Gum disease is an infection of your gums. It can cause loose teeth, bleeding gums, and bad breath. Stress can also contribute to gum disease if it causes you to grind your teeth, clench your jaw, or smoke cigarettes. If you have severe gum disease, you may need to see a dental specialist, called a periodontist. Your treatment may include stress reduction.
- 5. Burning MouthBurning mouth syndrome is a dry, hot and burning feeling in your mouth. Many things can cause this. Stress, anxiety and depression may be part of the problem. Dry mouth syndrome is more common in women after menopause, so hormone changes may also be involved. Treatment for dry mouth syndrome can include stress counseling and antidepressant medicine. Stress-related smoking and drinking can make burning mouth worse.
- 6. Nail BitingNail biting is a stress-related habit that can be harmful to your oral health and your overall health. Nail biting can move your teeth out of position. It can also damage your teeth. Adding the germs from your fingernails to the germs in your mouth can lead to mouth infections. You can even spread warts from your hands to your mouth. Viruses and bacteria that get picked up on your hands can spread to the rest of your body. Find better ways to reduce stress, or ask your doctor for help.
- Managing StressLearning how to reduce stress helps you live a healthier life overall. Here are a few ways: identify what stresses you (write them down); prioritize your responsibilities at home and work; get at least 7 to 8 hours of restful sleep every night; exercise—every day if possible; and talk about your problems with someone you trust. Seek professional counseling if you find it hard to manage the stress in your life.

Abstract
In the United States, judges are required to recuse themselves - that is, remove themselves from participating in a case - not only when they are biased, but even when they may appear biased to a neutral observer. This nominally strict, appearance-based recusal standard is intended to ensure the judge’s impartiality in resolving disputes, to protect the judiciary’s reputation, and to instill public confidence in the fairness of the courts. It has long been assumed that so long as the judge makes the correct recusal decision, the appearance of impartiality is restored and the reputation of the judiciary is protected.
This Article challenges that long-standing assumption and argues that the focus on appearances only at the time of the recusal decision, when the public has already formed its impressions of judicial impartiality, may not fully restore public confidence and protect the reputation of the judiciary. In other words, a judge’s recusal decision may be too little and come too late. Moreover, when appearances are considered on a case-by-case basis, often by the very judge whose impartiality has been challenged, even the correct nonrecusal decision does not always foster an appearance of impartiality.
Most of the literature on recusal focuses on the recusal standard and the reasons why judges might, intentionally or unintentionally, reach the incorrect recusal decision, and seeks solutions to that problem. In this Article, I propose a new role that appearances should play in American recusal jurisprudence, and a new approach to judicial recusal. I argue that rather than allowing individual judges to consider appearances ex post (i.e., in the context of individual cases), legislators must consider appearances ex ante to prevent the damage to the judiciary from arising in the first instance. This means that legislators must regulate judicial selection (including judicial elections) and judicial conduct, as well as extrajudicial conduct, with an eye towards potential future recusal. To that end, legislatures should create ethical rules and regulations designed to eliminate any appearance of impartiality from arising. And, to the extent that recusal cannot be avoided by such ex ante regulation, legislatures must also consider appearances ex ante in creating and implementing new recusal procedures.

From an anonymous posting in an online guest book:
It seems like only yesterday that as a new graduate student at the J-School in 1974, I quickly became friends with Stan. He was a smart, easy-going guy without any artifice.
I learned that he and Anita Jarris had run a weekly alternative paper in Harrisburg, PA, right around the time of the Three Mile Island meltdown, and realized right away that this was someone who had something of a counterculture bent, even if he didn't flaunt it.
Stan left the J-school and didn't go out on a job hunt like most of the rest of us. He instead made his way daringly as a freelance journalist, and he did it really well. In fact, after I returned to Columbia as a Bagehot Fellow in '78-9, and decided I didn't want to work as a journalism employee anymore, Stan was the mentor and model I turned to. He generously passed me contacts in the New York magazine world that allowed me to get my start. One of the first in our class to publish a book -- his wonderfully written and disturbingly insightful "Roadside Empires" about America's burgeoning fast-food industry -- he was also my model as a book author. I'll never forget his recounting of his road trip to report about the then new Chuckie Cheese franchise, which had me in stitches.
When I've found myself stuck at points writing a book, I always hark back to Stan telling me how, after slaving over that manuscript, one day it all came together for him. He said when that moment arrived, "It was suddenly like being a surfer catching a good wave." Having that image before me as a goal and knowing that eventually that wave will come has pulled me through a number of writers' block crises.
Stan was also generous in another way. When I moved back from LA to NY in late 1978 for my Bagehot year, and reconnected with Stan, I told him about the great journalist association we had in Los Angeles, the Los Angeles Media Alliance. He immediately said we should start something similar in New York, which we did, along with the likes of Gail Collins, Lisa Bergson, Larry Zuckerman and others. It was characteristic of Stan that he was always ready to pass around connections he had with editors -- and he had a lot of them! -- to help freelancers, both newbies and pros -- to gain access to a new market. He did this even though clearly doing so would put them in competition with him for assignments.
Stan was generous with his contacts, and also generous with his time. As mutual friend and classmate Steve Greenhouse says, he was a great friend. That effort at sharing, which became known as the New York Area Media Alliance, was a precursor to the founding, by Stan, myself and many others, of the National Writers Union back in 1983. The NWU is now a 1200-member trade union of writers in 13 locals around the country that is affiliated with the UAW.
Stan also had a wonderful sense of humor, and seemingly had no mean bone in his body.
He was also resilient. His wife Sarah, with whom he adopted two sons, Lewis and Daniel, had several bouts of cancer, and eventually died of that disease. I know it was a terrible blow to Stan when she died, but no partner could wish for a more patient and devoted spouse than Stan, who supported her all the way, including in her fierce determination to keep herself going until she saw her younger son Lewis bar mitzvahed, a feat she succeeded in pulling off.
When I learned a few weeks ago about Stan's cancer operation, which was a major procedure that left him bed-ridden and in considerable pain, I called and spoke with his son Lewis, who is 21. I asked how his dad was handling the aftermath of the operation and the inevitable pain and discomfort, and Lewis said, "He's okay. You know, my dad is a very strong person."
It still chokes me up remembering that conversation, but Lewis knew his dad, and he had it right. Stan was a very strong person who endured a lot with courage and resilience, and with an optimistic spirit. He also raised two great sons under very trying circumstances. When I saw Stan right after he'd gotten the diagnosis that he had an incurable form of mesothelioma, he told me, "Well I know what to do. I lived with a cancer patient for years, so I know all the ropes. I just have to click into cancer patient mode, only this time it's me."
The loss of this friend of 40 years is a terrible blow. My heart goes out to his sons Lewis and Daniel, to his devoted partner Susan, to his loving brother Larry and sister Deb who stood by him through this terrible time, and to his two parentsWeb Content Display Web Content Display

5:35 p.m.
A Treasury Department employee charged with leaking confidential banking reports of suspects in special counsel Robert Mueller’s investigation has appeared in court in Virginia.
Forty-year-old Natalie Mayflower Sours Edwards was released on $100,000 bond following an appearance Wednesday afternoon in federal court.
She worked as a senior adviser at the department’s Financial Crimes Enforcement Network.
Prosecutors say Edwards leaked several suspicious activity reports to a journalist. Prosecutors say reports on Paul Manafort, Richard Gates and Maria Butina were among those leaked.
Edwards’ attorney, Peter Greenspun, did not immediately respond to a call seeking comment.
The reporter wasn’t identified in court papers, but the documents listed about a dozen stories published by BuzzFeed News over the past year and a half.
BuzzFeed spokesman Matt Mittenthal declined to comment.
The criminal complaint was filed in Manhattan.

A Treasury Department employee has been charged with leaking confidential banking reports of suspects charged in special counsel Robert Mueller’s investigation.
Federal prosecutors say Natalie Mayflower Sours Edwards is set to appear in court Wednesday in Virginia.
The 40-year-old Edwards is a senior official at the department’s Financial Crimes Enforcement Network. She’s accused of leaking the material to a journalist — who’s not named in court papers.
Prosecutors say reports on Paul Manafort, Richard Gates and Maria Butina were among those leaked. Prosecutors allege Edwards photographed the confidential documents and sent them to the reporter using an encrypted messaging app.
Authorities say that when Edwards was arrested, she was found with a flash drive containing the confidential reports.
It wasn’t immediately clear whether Edwards had an attorney who could.Overview
The primary objective of a bug bash is to fix a number of issues in either a subset of code, or an entire project. Submitters do not need to work on all of the bugs as part of their submission - instead, each defect is assigned a dollar value.
You can review defects based on prize amount, severity, complexity and work on as many defects as you like (but only one defect at a time).
How long do bug bashes last?
Bug bashes will remain open until all bugs are resolved - typically this takes about 5 to 7 days.
How do I participate in a bug bash?
- Register for the bug bash contest, and ask for repo access in the contest forum.
- Review the open defects that are labeled ‘Open for Pickup’ and decide which one you would like to tackle first.
- If you find a defect you’d like to work on, simply assign the defect to yourself.
- You must update the label to “In Progress”, and remove the “Open For Pickup” label.
- Each registrant may only assign one issue to themselves at a time.
Workflow
Self assign > code > submit a pull request > look for the next issue > repeat.
Prize Amounts
Each issue will have a dollar value assigned - this can range anywhere from $5.00 to $100 based on complexity and size. This may slightly change based on the project.
Some things to note:
- Each issue has a dollar value. Dollar values are based upon complexity and priority of issue.
- You can assign any unassigned issue to yourself with a "Open for Pickup" (first come first serve).
- You must update the label to “In Progress”, and remove the “Open For Pickup” label.
- You can only self assign one issue at a time. The nature of it being assigned will indicate if it is not available to anyone else.
- You will fix the ticket as a pull request to the master branch
- Once a ticket is fixed, you should label it "Ready for Review" where it will then be verified. If something is still broken, the copilot will comment on the ticket.
- After submitting and tagging "Ready for Review" you are eligible to accept another. You can do as many tickets as you want, as long as you follow the rules above.
- If the ticket is fixed properly, your pull request will be merged in, and the ticket will be marked "Solution Accepted".
- If the ticket is rejected, it should be your first priority to fix the issue.
- When the ticket is closed, payment will be recorded, and ticket tagged "Payment Required", when we issue the payment the tag will be updated to “Paid”
- If an assigned task is not done in 8 hours, you will be unassigned from the ticket, and it will be opened back up to the community.
- You can ask questions directly on the ticket comments.
- Bug Bashes are different than Bug Hunts - please make sure to check the contest type in the contest name when registering.

Accept marriage documents issued to same-sex couples for marriages that took place
on October 06, 2014 or later by jurisdictions (town, county or State) in the State
of Virginia as evidence of a name change.
BRIEF SUMMARY
The ruling of the United States Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit in Bostic v. Schaefer went into effect on October 6, 2014, after the U. S. Supreme Court declined to review
the Fourth Circuit’s decision that Virginia’s statutes and state constitutional amendment
prohibiting same-sex marriage were unconstitutional. Bostic v. Schaefer, 760 F.3d 352 (4th Cir. 2014), cert. denied, ___ S. Ct. ___, 2014 WL 4230092 (2014).
Therefore, as of October 6, 2014, Virginia began issuing marriage licenses to same-sex
couples, and marriages could be performed that same day. Parties to a same-sex marriage
can use their marriage certificates to change their names in the same manner as opposite-sex
couples. Finally, Virginia law does not provide for civil unions or domestic partnerships,
so there is no change in status or need to dissolve these unions or partnerships prior
to entering into a same-sex marriage.
BACKGROUND
In Bostic v. Schaefer, 760 F.3d 352, 384 (4th Cir. 2014), the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit
held that Virginia’s statutes and state constitutional amendment prohibiting same-sex
marriage was unconstitutional. After the U.S. Supreme Court declined certiorari in
Schaefer v. Bostic, ___ S. Ct. ___, 2014 WL 4230092 (2014), the Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals issued
a mandate on October 6, 2014, giving effect to the previous ruling holding Virginia’s
statutory and constitutional ban unconstitutional. Bostic v. Schaefer, __ F.3d ___, 2014 WL 4960335 (2014). The Attorney General for the Commonwealth of
Virginia, Mark R. Herring, also issued a statement on October 6, 2014, indicating
that, following the Fourth Circuit’s mandate, marriage licenses for same-sex couples
could be issued and that the Commonwealth would recognize all marriages that were
lawfully performed in other states.) any change to the status of a prior or new civil union or domestic partnership
entered into in the same State; and
(4) whether a prior entered civil union or domestic partnership must be dissolved
before entering into a same-sex marriage.
DISCUSSION
1) The date the State will begin issuing marriage licenses and certificates to same-sex
couples.
As discussed above, Virginia began issuing marriage licenses to same-sex couples on
October 6, 2014. (last visited Oct. 16, 2014). Virginia does not have a waiting period to marry, so
same-sex couples were able to marry on that date. See, e.g., (last visited Oct. 16, 2014); (last visited Oct. 16, 2014).
2) Whether the State permits parties to the same-sex marriage to change their names
based on the marriage. Although Virginia has a civil process for a name change in
which a party can petition for a court-ordered name change pursuant to Va. Code Ann
§ 8.01-217 (2014), these formal procedures are not required for a name change following
a marriage. Virginia statutes do not expressly authorize a name change following marriage
using only the married name and production of a marriage certificate. Nevertheless,
in practice, Virginia allows a party to a marriage, whether the bride or the groom,
to begin using a new married name immediately after the marriage ceremony. See, e.g., (last visited Oct. 16. 2014); (last visited Oct. 16, 2014). In addition, the Virginia Department of Motor Vehicles
(DMV) permits parties to same-sex marriage to use a marriage certificate to change
their names in the same manner as opposite-sex couples. (last visited Oct. 17, 2014) (stating that a marriage certificate, including a same-sex
marriage certificate can be used as proof for a name change). As such, it is clear
Virginia permits parties to same-sex marriage to change their names based upon the
marriage in the same manner as opposite-sex married couples.
3) Whether there is any change to the status of a prior or new civil union or domestic
partnership entered into in Virginia. Virginia law does not provide for civil unions
or domestic partnerships, so this question is inapplicable. In fact, prior to the
decision in Bostic, the Virginia State Constitution prohibited the Commonwealth or its political subdivisions
from creating or recognizing a legal status for relationships of unmarried individuals
that “intends to approximate the design, qualities, significance, or effects of marriage.”
VA Const. art. 1 § 15-A. Similarly, the Virginia State Constitution further provided,
“Nor shall this Commonwealth or its political subdivisions create or recognize another
union, partnership, or other legal status to which is assigned the rights, benefits,
obligations, qualities, or effects of marriage.” Id.
4) Whether a prior entered civil union or domestic partnership must be dissolved before
entering into a same-sex marriage. As Virginia law does not provide for civil unions
or domestic partnerships, this question is inapplicable.

A Virginia certificate of marriage is not acceptable evidence of a legal change to
the first name. Virginia does not have a statute that expressly allows a first name
to be changed in the event of marriage.
QUESTION PRESENTED AND BRIEF ANSWER
Question: On August 18, 2011, you asked whether the agency is permitted to process a first
name change for NH S (SSN ) based upon a Commonwealth of Virginia certificate of marriage.
Answer: We have concluded that the agency should not recognize a marriage as a valid name
change event in Virginia for a NH wishing to change her first name because Virginia
does not have a statute that expressly allows a first name to be changed in the event
of marriage.
BACKGROUND
The NH was born “S She married C in Virginia on June. On March 30, 2006, the NH formally
changed her name with the agency to “S.” [1] She currently resides in California.
On August 15, 2011, the NH filed an SS-5 Application to change her name from “S ”
to “T.” To support the name change, the NH submitted a copy of her Commonwealth of
Virginia Certificate of Marriage, dated June 6, 1997, and a Commonwealth of Virginia
Marriage Register as proof of her marriage to Christopher. The marriage document does
not specify the new name to be used by the NH.
Because the marriage took place more than two years ago, the NH submitted the following
evidence of identity in addition to her marriage document. See Program Operations Manual System (POMS) Record Maintenance (RM) RM 10212.015D (marriage document may only be used as evidence of identity if the marriage occurred
within past two years), RM 10212.020C (where the marriage took place over two years ago, NH must submit evidence of identity
in addition to the marriage document). The NH submitted her birth certificate in the
name of “S.;” her expired Virginia driver’s license in the name of “T;” her current
United States passport in the name of “T;” and her current military identification
card in the name of “T.” [2] NH’s current California driver’s license, however, is in the name of “Sara.”
We are not aware of any further documentation that she presented with her request.
We are also not aware of the NH providing any evidence of a legal name change from
“S” to “T.”
General Agency Name Change Procedure
The Intelligence Reform and Terrorism Prevention Act requires the agency to “establish
minimum standards for verification of documents or records submitted by an individual
to establish eligibility for an original or replacement social security card.” See Intelligence Reform and Terrorism Prevention Act of 2004, Pub. L. No. 108-458, §
7213(a)(1)(B);
POMS RM 10210.001, RM 10210.405. The POMS directs the agency not to process a name change application unless the
application is submitted with evidence of a legal name change.
POMS RM 10212.165. Marriage is a recognized name change event. See
POMS RM 10212.010 (setting forth list of recognized name change events, i.e., marriage, divorce, naturalization, court ordered name change, amended birth certificate),
RM 10212.055.
Therefore, under current agency policy, the agency will not honor a request to change
a name based merely on a common law right to use a new name. See POMS RM 10212.015. The individual must show evidence of a name change event, evidence of a new name,
and evidence of the NH’s identity. See id. The POMS provides the illustration of a fictional NH,
Agnes, who requested a replacement card in the name “Annette.”
See POMS RM 10212.165H. In support of her application, Agnes did not provide any evidence of a legal name
change to “Annette ,” but her current state identity card showed her name as “Annette
.” Id. The agency denied Agnes’s request to change her first name because she did not submit
a name change document showing that she legally changed her first name. Id.
Agency Name Change Based Upon A Marriage Document
The POMS directs the agency to accept a name change document based on marriage as
evidence of the new name to be shown on the social security number card, if the new
name can be derived from the document. See POMS RM 10212.055. The POMS then qualifies the prior statement and provides a list of acceptable changes
to the last name, i.e., the bride takes the groom’s last name, or the groom takes the bride’s last name.
Id. Next, the POMS lists an exception to this rule with respect to an entirely new first
and last name. POMS RM 10212.055B (Exception). Per Regional Chief Counsel Precedent, an entirely new first and last
name as shown on the name change document can be accepted as evidence of a change
to both the first and last name where there is a state statute that expressly allows
a person to choose an entirely new first and last name in the event of marriage. Id.. [3]
The prior version of the POMS included section RM 00203.210B.1, which expressly stated that for United States residents, a legal name change based
on a United States marriage is dependent upon the laws of the State where the marriage
occurred. Recently, this POMS section was archived and replaced with RM 10212.000, et seq. Current section RM 10212.055 does not make such an explicit statement, but continues to cite to Regional Chief
Counsel Precedent, some of which relied upon RM 00203.210B.1. Because the NH’s marriage occurred in Virginia, we have analyzed this issue under
Virginia law.
The Marriage Document Does Not Support NH’s Request To Change Her First Name Under
Virginia Law
You have asked whether a NH may change her first name when the name change event is
a marriage in Virginia. According to the POMS, all states recognize the validity of
opposite-sex marriages performed in other states; therefore, when a person marries
in one state and applies in another state to change her name on the agency record,
the agency is to assume the marriage is recognized. See POMS RM 10212.025. However, when a legal opinion precedent is required to determine whether the document
submitted is acceptable for a name change, the agency does not follow common law.
See POMS RM 10212.015. Rather, the agency generally follows statutory law. Id.
The Virginia Change of Name statute does not expressly allow or disallow a couple
to take an entirely new name. Va Code Ann. § 8.01-217 (West 2011). The sole reference
in the statute to a name change based upon marriage is that a court order “shall not
be required of a person who changed his or her former name by reason of marriage and
who makes application to resume a former name pursuant to § 20-121.4 [Restoration
of Former Name].” The NH would be unable to change her first name under Virginia law
by virtue of the marriage, as the Virginia statute does not expressly allow for such
a name change. Id. Therefore, the exception in
POMS RM 10212.055B does not apply.[4]
CONCLUSION
The agency should not recognize the NH’s marriage as a valid name change event in
Virginia with respect to her first name because Virginia does not have a statute that
expressly provides for such a change in the event of marriage, and therefore the exception
set forth in POMS RM 10212.055B does not apply.
Sincerely, Eric P. Kressman Regional Chief Counsel,
Region III By:________________
Katie M. Gaughan
We are not aware of the documentation provided to the agency by the NH to change her
last name to “W” in 2006.
We are not aware of how the NH changed her first name on her United States passport,
military identification card, and expired Virginia driver’s license to “T.” See, e.g., Virginia Department of Motor Vehicles, (last visited September 2, 2011) (requiring a marriage certificate, divorce decree
or court order as proof of name change). In any event, changing of the first name
on these documents is not dispositive for a name change by the agency. See POMS RM 10212.15 (requiring a name change event), 10212.165H (providing examples of
name changes that SSA cannot process)..
The Virginia Constitution provides that the General Assembly shall confer upon the
courts the power to change names. Va. Const. Art. 4 § 14 (West 2011). Virginia follows
common law, which provides that a person is free to adopt any name if it is not done
for a fraudulent purpose or in infringement upon the rights of others. In re S, 220 S.E.2d 245 (Va. 1975). The Virginia Attorney General, however, has issued an
opinion that a person who wishes to change his/her name must comply with the procedural
requirements of the Virginia Name Change Statute, § 8.01-217. 1985-86 Va. Op. Atty.
Gen. 21, 1986 WL 221187 (Va. A.G.) (citing Barrett v. Commw. of VA, 689 F.2d 498 (4th Cir. 1982)). Therefore, to effect a name change under the Virginia
statute, a formal petition for name change must be filed with the court and, then,
it is within the court’s discretion to issue a court order granting the name change.
Va Code Ann. § 8.01-217 (West 2011). As noted above, however, the NH now resides in
California.I’ve gotten wind that someone may have been decapitated in a nasty wreck that just happened on Highway 11 at the Glenwood intersection.

Monday morning Snappers. Ah, love it, I’m always excited Monday morning. It’s like a new week and that’ll be because it is a new week. Duh.
I had a good week last week and I plan on having a good week this week, so I’ve started in the same vein. I went for my longer run this morning. I fired up a couple of Basecamp threads with my two contractors who are helping me, weekly threads for this week to chat about priorities and what we’re doing. Had breakfast and now I’m sitting with a cup of tea and my moleskin, you might have seen it last week, if not I’ll show you in a sec.
As I’ve said before, Moleskin, nice pen, cup of tea and for all you parents out there listen to this.[screen: BLISS]
Thoughts on videos so far. I’m really enjoying it, I’m able to churn out content quite quickly. I like the vlogging aspect of it. I myself went back and watched a few last night because I was trying to find ones to get transcribed. I found it interesting to know what I was doing at that time, see even in just a few weeks how I’ve moved forward. I’m going to continue doing vlogging, especially thinking about my kids. But, I do want to create smaller videos that are more on point and can have a title and whatever is in the video is just about that title.
Loving the Snapchat app for creating videos. It’s just… It’s brilliant. It’s teaching me to deliver my lines, like I said before. Although maybe not so good in my last Snap, but whatever, I’ll keep going.
What I’m thinking of doing this week is, I will save the whole of the story to my camera and upload it as vlog with a date and time-stamp on it. In my YouTube channel, I’ll create a “vlog playlist,” so I’ve got an “AndyTalks Playlist” and I’ve got an “AdWords Playlist” and I’ve got a “Vlog Playlist.” I’ll start cutting out little segments from the daily vlog and posting them as separate AndyTalks or AdWords or whatever.IBRC is a California based company with a rich history in primary market research.

I am not exaggerating the number of questions I have answered. They are in thousands. I began with Orkut, then to Test Republic, Software Testing Club, My blog, Software Testing Help, Testing Circus Magazine, Twitter and as of today forums like Quora.
What has troubled me over the last decade is – the questions have not changed. This industry seems stuck. The beginners, the intermediates and the experts of this industry still ask the same questions and get the same answers. I feel unchallenged by newbie testers and intermediates. On the other side, experts have become experts answering the same question over decades. I wondered long ago if Michael Bolton would ever get tired of answering to the questions on testing in agile-testing list. He never got tired. I never got tired. I think we just are getting sicker.
For those like Bolton, they need a very suitable challenge. I don’t see the challenge. People still keep asking about the future, about manual versus automation, about their career options and which tool to learn so that their career gets better.
Here is my dream. A dream of how the questions should be.
I began testing a mobile app as I found an app review pertaining to payment failure. This feature had been extensively tested by me. I got in touch with the user and found out the steps or flow the user took to get to the issue. I asked him how reproducible is this on his phone (Lenovo A6000) and got the all apps used by him through a tool I built to take a snapshot of the phone state. I ran those steps on the same exact phone with same snapshot. I thought I tried recreating everything the user said and I was unable to reproduce this bug. I spoke to the developers about this and they enabled the logging for me which is usually switched off to not let it impact the performance. From the logs, I do not see the problem. I then made a list of things that could be creating the problem such as
- Payment Gateway
- Network
- Carrier
- Location
- Other apps
- Battery
- State at which the app starts
- Timing issues
Attached is my mind map and excel for you to go through the depth of my work. Of course, I have removed all confidential aspects. I seek the help of experts to help me with more ideas that I need to include in my checklist.
And that is an apt challenge to a legend like Michael Bolton. Michael doesn’t get it. Instead he gets, how much time would it take to test software manually? and I am like, you don’t need a Michael Bolton for it.

Disney will have to divest its interests in History, H2, Crime & Investigation, Blaze and Lifetime in the European Economic Area (EEA) to avoid harming competition following its purchase from Fox. The channels are controlled by A+E Television Networks, which is a joint venture between Disney and Hearst.
The Commission’s action has no bearing on the operation of the channels in the U.S. and elsewhere. (H2 was rebranded as Viceland in the U.S. in 2016.)
The European Commission’s investigation found that combining Fox and Disney’s film studios raised no concerns because the merged company still faces significant competition from other film studios, including Sony, Universal and Warner Bros.
In a statement, Disney indicated it is aiming to get final approval for the merger in the territories where regulators still haven’t rendered a verdict.
Earlier this year, the U.S. Department of Justice granted its approval, provided that Disney divest Fox’s 22 regional sports networks. Officially, Disney and Fox have forecast closing the deal in the first half of 2019, but multiple sources have pointed to early in the year as the key time, and both companies have altered their executive suites in anticipation.
“We are gratified by the decision of the European Commission to clear the transaction with the sole remedial measure being the divesting of our interests in Europe of the History, H2, Crime + Investigation, Blaze and Lifetime channels,” Disney’s statement said. “Disney will continue to be a 50% owner of A&E apart from the companies operating these channels in Europe. We continue to pursue clearance as quickly as possible in the jurisdictions that remain.”Netball Australia has today announced Samsung Diamonds assistant coach Roselee Jencke OAM has made the decision to step down from her role with the national team for family reasons.

“I have enjoyed my time with the Diamonds, it has been an honour to work with such talented coaches and players.
“This decision wasn’t taken lightly, but a necessary one at this time in my life. The extra travel and time away has taken its toll, and I look forward to more time with my family.
“I’m really enjoying my role at the Firebirds and believe Suncorp Super Netball provides a genuine pathway for coaches with ambitions of working with the national team.
“Netball globally is in a really exciting period and I can’t wait to see the next wave of talented Diamonds come through the ranks and make their mark on the sport,” Jencke said.
Diamonds head coach Lisa Alexander thanked Jencke for her contribution to the national team.
“Roselee has influenced and inspired a generation of Australian players in her role as Diamonds assistant coach, and will continue to do so through her work at all levels of netball.
“She was instrumental in guiding the Diamonds defensive group.
“We are sad to see Roselee leave the national coaching ranks, but totally respect and understand her decision, and wish her well for the remainder of the Suncorp Super Netball season,” Alexander said.The serious business of adult life is often learned through playtime. Children’s games, though seemingly innocent and fun, can have a darker side. Consider the origins of many familiar nursery rhymes. Many of the rules of behavior, including the establishment of a societal pecking order, can be passed down in games.
On the lighter side, we almost universally share fun memories of similar childhood games — chasing, hiding, seeking and tagging. Games can teach us the process of learning, and help us to remember through singing and playing.
This week, writers responded with different insights to the June 17, 2015 prompt: In 99 words (no more, no less) write a story that involves a children’s game or rhyme.

A Game of Marco Polo by Ula Humienik
“Marco.”
“Polo.”
“Marco.”
“Polo.”
“Got you.”
“Not fair. This pool is too small for a game of Marco Polo.”
“It is not. You’re just a sore loser.”
“Am not.”
“Are too.”
“No way.”
“Yes way.”
“Mom, Sandy’s not playing nice again.”
“That’s not true. Take it back.” Sandy reached for Teri’s wrist and grabbed really hard.
“You’re hurting me. Mom. Mom, Sandy’s hurting me.”
“Am not.”
“Why isn’t mom answering?”
“I don’t know. She’s probably reading her lady magazines.”
“Mom. Mom. MOM!” Teri rushed out the pool and ran inside. Sandy followed her.
“Mom. Mom! Mom?”
“Quick. Call 911.”

Sight by Paula Moyer
For someone as nearsighted as Jean, swimming in a pool, without contacts or glasses, was a lot like “pin the tail on the donkey.” While her dad, the World War II pilot, had the eagle coveted acuity of 20/15, Jean’s chart said she could see “hand motion” at 20 feet.
Then the optometrist suggested prescription swim goggles. They were especially made for her strength, and they arrived a week after ordering.
She stepped into the pool and applied her goggles. It was like removing the blind. She could see things: The clock on the wall. Lane markers. Other swimmers.

A Real Keeper by Charli Barli Mills
Gus drew a circle in the dirt, then a starting line in the middle. The boys set down their clays. The new girl, Dina, added two green porcelains. Gus drew a deep breath. A girl with marbles? He wiped his palms and knelt with his blue slag shooter. Before the teacher pulled the bell rope, Dina added the boys’ marbles to her bag.
Gus walked beside her. “Can I see your shooter?”
“Sure.”
Swirls of amber, a real keeper. So he’d think years later as they exchanged vows, and he smiled into her eyes as pretty as her taw.

School Policy by Pete Fanning
Taj sat perched at the edge of his seat.
“Taj, pushing and shoving violate our anti-bullying policy. And running—”
The door cracked open. Taj’s eyes dropped to his feet as his mother entered. A slight tuna smell clung to her uniform.
“Mrs. Sallio.”
“Sorry,” she panted, her accent heavy with her breaths. “I ran right over. Had to push my way through a mob on Seventh.”
The principal grimaced. “I see…uh..”
“What did you do?” she snapped at her son.
“Well, Taj organized a game of musical chairs at lunch.”
Mrs. Sallio’s scowl turned upwards. “Did you win?”

Easter Surprise by Susan Budig
Sonja sneaked downstairs, hoping to be the first one to her Easter basket. She spied her cousin Tor popping jelly beans into his mouth.
“Are you eating my candy?”
“Heck no, the Easter bunny only left you little brown souvenirs ,” he teased.
“You mean bunny poop? He did not!”
“Uh-huh, sure did, look!”
Sonja stared at the small brown pellets.
Suddenly, Tor popped one in his mouth. “They taste good, though, try one!”
“Torsten Martin Gustavsson! Spit that out!”
Instead, he scooped them all up. “Funny how they taste like raisins,” he said, laughing with his mouth full.

Red Rover by Mercy.James.
She remembered endless school lunch hours – sandwiches and fruit washed quickly down with milk, the need to break free of the hall doors – hitting fresh school yard air.
Sides chosen – lines formed – “Red Rover” chained arms linked in clasping solidarity as the call for someone to come over – charging into battle – trying to break the lines – win some, lose some – knowing the weakest runners/pushers and the strongest links; strategies played over in small conflicts, ending with arms and legs twisting – wonder no one wrenched shoulders out of sockets.
Remembering – was I really that strong – or just a fearsome bully?
###
Red Rover – and Out by Jules Paige
Pretty much always being the new kid on the block I was more than
less, always picked last. Picked on, picked over. Left to watch when
the teams were even and I wasn’t chosen. Frozen to move, be hurt,
be blamed. As the others untamed in their innocence, taught by their
parents prejudice, snickered and laughed.
If chosen at all I was always the first one rammed. Be them damned,
those little mongrels for not learning how to accept differences.
Once a tool, labeled fool – I do believe I’m better. Some memories, rot.

Freeze Tag by Roger Shipp
“You ever noticed that even on the hottest of days, Evan never sweats?”
“His mother says that he takes after his father.”
“What does that mean?”
“I don’t know. Ms. Felcher gets a faraway look in her eye. I just don’t go there.”
“Evan never talks about his dad. What happened?”
“Heard he just went away. Never proved it, but they say he killed a man.”
“Must be true. Why else would he have left ‘em?”
“Evan is weird. He’s never played Freeze Tag with us.”
“His mother won’t let him. Says it would be the death of us.”
###
Spaghetti Toast by Pat Cummings
The once-full platter of spaghetti, glistening strands coated and over-topped with Dad’s wonderful sauce, lay abandoned in the middle of the table as we said grace.
The bottle of juice passed, and each of us had a full plate and glass in front of us. The Parmesan cheese shaker went around the table, and we sprinkled our spaghetti with that pungent dust.
Mom and Dad began eating, but we youngsters waited to begin. First, we must toast. We raised our baby-wine together three times.
To the King!
To the Queen!
To the stinky-feet Cheese!
Only then would we eat.

Who’s Got the Button by Ann Edall-Robson
“Button, button, who’s got the button?”
He laughed as he tweaked her nose and showed his thumb peeking out between his two fingers.
Reaching for his hand, the little girl giggled.
“Daddy! Give it back!”
It was a their game. Filled with laughter, teasing and eventually the return of the imaginary nose.
“She’s as cute as you, Button.”
His voice ragged with gruff emotion when he said the pet name for his grown daughter holding her newborn.
Leaning over he gently tweaked the tiny nose.
“Dad! Give it back!”
Laughter erupted from them. Carefree memories trickled down their cheeks.
###
Ellen shakes her head. “Grandpa, that’s not the real name of the game. It’s Simon Says.”
“Not this version,” Ed replies to his granddaughter.
“Alright. OK. Let’s just do it,” the youngster reluctantly responds.
Ed smiles and begins. “Ed says scratch your head.” Ellen and Edna immediately scratch their head.
“Ed says blink twice.” Ellen and Edna do it.
“Ed says smile.” Ellen and Edna grin from ear to ear.
“Hug your grandmother.” Ellen gives Edna a big hug.
“I didn’t say Ed says. You lose, young lady.”
Ellen laughs. “No, Grandpa. I won. I got to hug Grandma.”

Role Play by Ruth Irwin
“Nan, you be the Darling and I be the Mum. Okay?”
“Okay.”
“Darling, I have to go to work and you have to go to kindy.”
“But I don’t want to go to kindy Mummy. Wah.”
“Stop crying Darling. You have to go to kindy. You can play with your friends and I’ll come back and get you later.”
“Wah, wah. I don’t want to go to kindy. I want to stay home and make cookies with you.”
“Nan!! You’re not allowed to say that! You have to say…”
Remember Nan, you’re the Darling; do as you’re told!

Playing Safe by Irene Waters
“Mummy. Can I play billycarts at John’s?”
“No Joanie, it’s too dangerous.”
“How about bike riding at Heather’s?”
“No too dangerous.”
“Swimming at Robbo’s?”
“No. His parents are away. Can’t you think of something to play here?”
“How about Hula hoops? “
“Hula hoops are fine.”
Standing at the kitchen window, her arms covered in suds, she watched with joy the two little girls gyrating their hips and arms as the hula hoop spun round. As a red film made the window opaque she lost sight of the girls. She screamed. She hadn’t thought of the staple that could sever a carotid.

You Are It by A. R. Amore
Sitting on the porch I can hear them, out there, silently creeping. I squint trying to catch a glimpse of their forms, but it’s impossible. Hushed whispers, a rustling by the stand of pines and then nothing.
I try to assess. Five, maybe six of them but I cannot be sure. There must be others; they move in larger groups this time of year. Our dog stiffens up and growls through the screen door.
“What’s out there,” my wife asks. They are close. Suddenly, a flurry of flashlights burst following a chorus of, “You’re it! You’re it! You’re it!”
###
She crouched, hands over her ears, playground voices taunting.
“Mary, Mary, quite contrary! How does your garden grow!”
The group of giggling girls skipped away.
Mary stayed near the brick wall, shaking, imagining the torture of silver bells, the beheadings, the garden of gravestones her grandfather told her about one night when she had asked for a bedtime story.
She thought back to Kindergarten, when the teasing made her cry just because the singing of her name had sounded unkind. Now, only one year later, she cried because the images of death played in her mind like a slideshow.

Mairzy Doats by Jeanne Lombardo
The box was just long and wide enough for Maddy to crawl in.
“Stand up,” the children yelled.
Maddy felt herself righted. Her bare feet stumbled. The voices
sang as from afar.
“Over here Maddy!” called one.
“Over here!” called another.
She spiraled, tripped, thudded on the ground.
Panic set her breathing again, but the voices had taken flight. Her pleas shrill sirens in the empty yard.
At last, a yank, a release into light and air and the sing-song of her mother’s voice.
“Mairzy doats and dozy doats and liddle lamzy divey
A kiddley divey too, Wooden shoe!”

Cowboys and Indians by Christina Rose
I sat crouched in the grass, honey stalks swaying around me as grasshoppers bounced across my shimmering skin. Pioneer outfit clung to clammy skin, sticky in the late July sun. She was out there, waiting for me to stand, to shoot with her faux bow and arrow.
In her black wig and leather dress, she was the Indian and I, the cowboy. We would call a truce soon, join forces for our mid-day picnic. Then, resume the game of cat and mouse.
The field near our house, days of warm summer games, memories of laughter-filled childhood summers past.

A look at the personal and professional lives of a group of women who perform for a wrestling organization in Los Angeles during the 1980s.
Sam Sylvia is loosely based on Matt Cimber, the original GLOW director.
There have been many moments during shows and matches in the series where kayfabe (or the protection of the wrestling business) was broken. While it exists in-name-only nowadays, back in the 1980s, it was still taken very seriously..Purchase this article with an account.

Purpose: :
The retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) fulfils a variety of tasks which are essential for retinal function. This requires a multitude of different regulatory pathways and the ability to react to a large variety of stimuli. One of these stimuli is heat. Puposer of this study was to identify the heat-sensing pathway in the RPE.
Methods: :
The expression profile of probable heat-sensing ion channels was investigated by RT PCR. Responses from RPE cells to heat-stimuli were investigated by measurements of intracellular free Ca2+ with fura-2 and by the patch-clamp technique.
Results: :
RT-PCR analysis of cDNA from freshly isolated human RPE cells revealed the expression of TRPV1,2, 3 and 4 channels. Increasing the temperature from room temperature to either 45°C or 56°C led to an increase in [Ca2+]i in human RPE cells in primary culture. These temperature-induced rises in intracellular Ca2+ were blocked by 100 µM La3+ or 1 µM ruthenium-red. Application of the TRPV1 opener capsaicin (1 µM) did not increase [Ca2+]i whereas application of the TRPV opener 2-ABP [Ca2+]i. Whole-cell currents in ARPE-19 cells showed at a holding potential -40 mV, the transient activation of an inward-current by rising the temperature to 45°C. In the presence of 20 µM ruthenium-red, rising the temperature to 45°C failed to activate this inward current.
Conclusions: :
In summary, we conclude that increase in the temperature leads to rises in [Ca2+]i by activation of TRPV2 or TRPV3 channels. Thus, the RPE is able to sense heat. Since the RPE absorbs the major of the light energy which is focused by a lens onto the retina heat sensing by the RPE is a novel important mechanism to adopt its function to changes in the light intensity.

I first fell in love in California.
Mystified and utterly starstruck, I disembarked in a land of endless sunshine and fast friends. From the merciless grind that had become my dull life back in Ohio, I surfaced, like great Pacific waves — and I began to change.
The quiet Owl in the back of the classroom took more of the center stage, Lion/Peacock style. My confidence surged. My love for friends and finding new passions trickled into a river by the close of my first NSLC experience in the Bay Area.
Leaving those moments of euphoria? Challenging, depressing, and disorienting, to say the least.
Nothing could compare to the Golden State in my gold-tinted lens on life. I pined for the pines, made moves to climb more mountains, and wallowed in the winters of Midwest Ohio.
It used to be, for me, California or bust. Nothing else, no one else, would do.
Some of my friends didn’t understand my yearning for those golden days — but who wouldn’t want to return to their place of comfort and Golden State of glory?
I knew when I signed on for another UC Berkeley NSLC experience this summer that I would struggle, initially, to make new memories in a space and place that still burned bright with gleeful — and painfully bittersweet — memories.
Coming back to the same stomping grounds was jolting, at first, without the same staff to occupy it. Everything looked as it did two years ago, didn’t it?
The Bay really hadn’t changed, right?
Well, it’s complicated.
See, because of my revelations in Singapore, I’m now much more aware of the world as it is, instead of how I previously presumed it to be in my Athens state of mind.
What I saw this time around in San Francisco was less than my idyllic fantasy of summers past and much more the reality that is all around us today.
It’s sort of like this: A pretty bizarre grouping of loners, stoners, and I’m-on-my-own-ers. A community crushed and squeezed by its mega-wealthy population in designer suits and swagged-out cars.
It’s dirtier and harsher on its outer edges than I remember in my wanderlust-coated haze the first time I was in San Francisco.
And me? I’ve changed, too.
I’m not the same high-strung, ambition-churning workaholic I was when I first got my taste of the West Coast vibes.
I’ve learned too much about the world to turn and ignore it, like I was privileged to do before.
What I’ve realized since being back in the Bay is that California isn’t some homogeneous utopia for the environmentally conscious — it’s an escape for some, a fairytale for those who can afford it.
And for everyone else? A perplexingly expensive vacation destination for the fortunate few.
I’ve started thinking: Honestly, why would I choose California over every other viable option of living at this point in my young life, when I’m short on capital and capital gains?
Economically, it doesn’t make much sense for me at this moment. Realistically, California’s got its own baggage that doesn’t always serve its marketed purpose.
I’m not saying I now loathe the likes of California. Like everything else in life, there’s two sides to every story. The one we hear first may not match the one that comes in times of need.
Home, I came to realize while wrapped up in a wheelchair last fall, is a lot more about a feeling than a place or destination.
Luckily this summer, I had the amazing friendship of a whole new group of people who started to make me feel home in the comforts of my own skin — no strings attached, no location required.
So now, back on the runway and on my way back home to Ohio for a bit, I’m carrying with me the lessons learned from this summer: that love and friendship have to start with where you are; that dreams aren’t always what they seem; and the story you write yourself can change — and that can be the most fulfilling part of the journey.

However, the pregnancy period is not all roses and as your body progresses towards pregnancy, sleeping with a baby bump can take some getting used to. Thus, expectant mothers need a pillow that can wholly support the bump and provide a restful sleep. Pregnancy pillows are a big help, and if you’ve never tried one, you should! It’s also a pillow that can help specific sleepers other than expectant moms.
Top Questions
Buyers Guide
- What is a pregnancy pillow?
Answer: The pregnancy pillow is a type of pillow designed to support the bodies of expectant mothers. It is grouped into two types—the full-length and the wedge. Full-length pregnancy pillows accommodate the body’s length. It comes in several shapes so users can wrap themselves with the pillow. Wedge pillows on the other hand are smaller—it’s even smaller than average pillows. It is designed to support the bump and stop users from rolling on their back. It can be used between the knees to ease lower back pain.
- What are the different types of full-length pregnancy pillows?
Answer: There are two types of full-length pregnancy pillows—the U-shaped and the C-shaped. The U-shaped pillow is shaped like the letter U and it is designed to contour throughout the user’s body. The body must be huddled in the U’s center part. It was made to support the head, the neck, hips, the legs and the baby bump. The C-shaped pillow meanwhile is shaped like the letter C. There are C-shaped pillows which curves throughout the body to accommodate the back and the bump while some are designed to contour in front but does not include the back. This is best if you tend to sleep on the side.
- When should you use a pregnancy pillow?
Answer: Pregnant moms should start using pregnancy pillows at around 20 weeks of their pregnancy in order to take weight off of their spine. Then again, you can begin using this type of pillow at any time during the period if you want a more comfortable sleep. Even non-pregnant individuals can take advantage of pregnancy pillows—people suffering from back pain can use this pillow to keep them on their side while sleeping and remove weight off of their spine.

After a 23 year absence, I returned to my childhood home, and the beautiful view. Weather permitting and sometimes enhancing, we are blessed with amazing sunsets over Port Gardner Bay including Mukilteo, Whidbey Island, Hat Island, Camano Island, and the Olympic Mountain Range. As the sun makes its journey from south to north and back again, we capture it and share it here. I created this site to share our good fortune and hopefully bring a smile to the world.

p.s. I’m your follower.According to the US Constitution, the crime of treason is defined as "levying war against the United States, or giving aid and comfort to its enemy. Also according to the US Constitution treason is a crime for which impeachment is a remedy. Every child educated in this country learns that The US Constitution is the acknowledged Supreme Law of the Land, the standard by which all American laws are measured. However, since the occupation of our White House in 2009 by Barack Obama and his rogue Administration, this noble and unique document has been continuously and routinely trampled in pursuit of Obama's liberal-socialist agenda.
Anyone who keeps up with world events today knows that the Islamic terrorist group ISIS presents a very real and present danger to the safety and security of, not only America, but to the entire world as well. America needs as its leader one who truly loves this nation, and who is totally dedicated and committed to doing whatever is necessary to keep America both safe and secure.
By refusing to acknowledge that ISIS and other radical Islamist terror groups are part of and claim to represent Islam, Barack Obama has refused to make America safe and secure. He has given "Aid and Comfort" to this avowed enemy of the United States by (1) weakening our own military, and (2) strengthening ISIS by funding the Muslim Brotherhood and other ISIS support groups. America's avowed enemy and the impeachable crime of treason have been well documented, and the evidence and witnesses are abundant and available. Now it is time for Congress to do its sworn duty and impeach Barack Obama for the crime of treason! We seem to be more concerned about what will happen if Obama is forcibly removed from office than we are about what will happen when ISIS brings its version of Islamic terrorism to the neighborhoods of America.

A free guide to safety eyewear is being launched today across the Republic of Ireland.
The eyes and vision are particularly vulnerable to hazards in the workplace and it is the employer’s responsibility to ensure that the risks are correctly assessed and appropriate policies are put in place. Specsavers Corporate Eyecare has produced a free guide to provide employers with comprehensive eyecare information and an understanding of the intricacies of selecting the appropriate safety eyewear. The publication covers legislation, common misconceptions, levels of protection and procurement options.
Also explained are the wider-reaching positive implications of a full eye examination due to the numerous illnesses and medical conditions that can be detected and monitored through routine retinal screening.
While the Safety, Health and Welfare at Work regulations contain detailed legislation, each different working environment presents its own unique risks and requirements. When developing an eyecare policy and purchasing the necessary eye protection, health and safety managers have a great many factors to consider. The provision of effective safety eyewear is not only about meeting the essential standards but also the needs of the individual. The guide aims to help put theory into practice.

Before I get to that I do want to give you all a heads up that I only have three patterns left on my craftsy site. If you need any of the templates for the special buildings I’ve created you can find them on my etsy site listed here:
- Dresden Neighborhood Pattern
- Around the World Special Dresden Wedge Templates
- Madison Building Special Dresden Wedge Templates
- Port Washington Building Dresden Wedge Templates
You can check out all the Dresden Neighborhoods I made this year by heading over to the Wrap Up page HERE. I have a link up set up on the bottom of the Wrap Up Page so if you made any Dresden Neighborhoods be sure to share them!
This gorgeous Christmas neighborhood was made by Kathryn McCarty. Her husband hauled out an architecture book to make a domed church! I love that this pattern even made him excited about this! I think she did a fabulous job!
And here is Kathryn McCarty’s second Christmas neighborhood – similar to the first, but completely different. It’s amazing how you can start with the same pattern/concept and completely change the look of it.
Connie Buffham Bailey made this fabulous Upcycled Neighborhood. She used silk neckties for the houses and the background is made from a white shirt! How brilliant is this?!
Kerry Mackie made this gorgeous Dresden Neighborhood. I love all the unique shapes fo the windows and the window box with flowers is fantastic!
Maree Rogers added borders to her first Dresden Neighborhood and called it “Scrapville”. I love that she made it into a bigger quilt since she didn’t have more space to display an art quilt. It’s gorgeous and I love that she used her scraps for this!
Here is “The Neighborhood is Going to the Dogs” by Liz Campbell! Liz took a workshop with me in Lawrence, Kansas in 2017 and this is her finish. It was such an amazing group of quilters and still one of the best road trips my family took. Great job Liz and thanks for sharing!
Here is Mary Pat van Schyndel’s first Dresden Neighborhood. I love seeing it hanging in her home and it looks fabulous with her decor!
I love this stripey Dresden Neighborhood pattern by Thankful Sanftleben! Great job Thankful!
Vivien Newton made this fantastic “Seasons of Life #2: Memories of the 70s and 80s” Dresden Neighborhood. She used a collection of fabrics from her clothes making years when decorator ducks ruled!
Tara Marie Pezzino made this fabulous Christmas Dresden Neighborhood. She used a silhouette from Scan n Cut to create Santa and his reindeer – what a fabulous touch!
And the last Dresden Neighborhood I’ll feature in this post is made by Patricia Hjortness Pollock. She didn’t finish it quite in time for Christmas but it’s so beautiful who really cares? It’s staying on her wall until she decides on the colors for her next one! Love it!
Have you joined my facebook “Quilt and Dream Along with Kim Lapacek” yet? Be sure to do so – it’s become a really fun place to show and share different projects folks are working on from my patterns. In 2019, my goal is to release quite a few more patterns – it should be epic!

The tour around the Sella group, the so-called "Sellaronda", is considered one of the most beautiful tours within the alpine span, taking you across the Ladin valleys of the Dolomites: Val Gardena, Val di Fassa, Livinalongo and Val Badia. With countless ski lifts, Sellaronda offers slopes of every difficulty level, satisfying every ski lover.
The Dolomitisuperskipass includes the entirety of the quota of the lifts that play a part of Sellaronda.
The Sella group, with Piz Boé, the highest peak (3,151 m), is the center of this magnificent tour. The Val Lasties and Val di Mezdí valleys, the most beautiful slopes of the Dolomites that cross the Sella group, are passable until the middle of May, taking advantage of the ski lift that goes from Passo Pordoi to Sass Pordoi.
Sellaronda takes you to 4 passes: Sella pass, Pordoi pass, Campolongo pass and Gardena pass. The tour is equipped with a very modern ski lift and its slopes are comprised of a total of 26km of slopes with a gradient of 4,500 m.
Sellaronda is adapted to any average skier, not presenting particular difficulties.
Maps of Sellaronda can be obtained at our Reception.Near Paris, visit the Villa Savoye in Poissy, a modernist manifesto by Le Corbusier.
The five points of a new architecture..
The architect. Swiss-born, Charles-Édouard Jeanneret (1887-1965), known as Le Corbusier, was part of the Parisian avant-garde. He was a founding member of the International Congress on Modern Architecture (or CIAM), launched in 1928.
An iconic building. This weekend retreat is the last in Le Corbusier’s white villa cycle and perfectly encapsulates the Modernist architectural vocabulary. Abandoned, it was restored by the French state from 1963 to 1997. It was listed as a historic monument in 1964 when Le Corbusier was still alive, an extraordinarily rare occurrence.Hope everyone had a wonderful weekend! We were busy, good busy. The mister was working all weekend, but I was playing. the weather was gorgeous. I got to celebrate a friend’s birthday, attend a tea and crumpet gathering, a fabulous dinner at this place, and go to the beach.
This was my first time going to a tea and crumpet party. Crumpets, which are a mix between a pancake and an english muffin, are pretty darn good. If you’d like to try them, you can purchase already made ones, at trader Joe’s. They’re pretty much a carb overload, but, who doesn’t love that! I was also part of a very special celebration this weekend, for a very special lady. So proud of you, Stephanie. Then Sunday rolled around, and it was time to hit the beach for a little r&r. So we gathered some folks together and made a fun day out of it. Thanks, friends.
I feel so grateful to be surrounded by such amazing people, today. Who knew life could be this good!We are proud to present the scholarly research relating to, and carried out by, the Student-Run Health Clinic at Case Western Reserve University:

Columbus, Ohio – The Ohio State men’s track and field team moved up from a 10th-place standing after day-one competition Saturday at the 2005 Big Ten Indoor Championships to finish the event sixth in the team standings with 49 team points Sunday. Wisconsin won the team title with a cumulative score of 144.50. Purdue’s Lambert Field House served as the host venue to league meet.
Senior Bryan Duby (Silver Lake, Ohio) concluded his Big Ten career with a title in the weight throw, giving Ohio State the weight championship for the third straight season. In 2003 and `04, former Buckeye Dan Taylor claimed the weight crown. Duby won the 2005 competition with a heave of 65 feet, 0 3/4 inches.
On the track, freshman Tony Cole (Columbia, Md.) gave Ohio State a sweep of the men’s and women’s 60-meter dashes with a winning time of 6.76. At the women’s event in Ann Arbor, Mich., sophomore Jenna Harris won the women’s 60m. Cole’s teammate Todd Dutch (Turnerville, N.J.) also contributed team points with a sixth-place finish in the 60m in a time of 6.81. Later Sunday, Dutch added a fifth-place score in the 200m in 21.75. Cole and Dutch combined for one additional team point, leading the Buckeye 4×400-meter relay to an eighth-place finish (3:16.06).
Another Ohio State freshman scored points in the field events as Marios Iacovou (Nicosia, Cypress) took third in the men’s high jump at a height of 6-11 1/2.
Senior Brian Olinger scored points for the Buckeyes for the second straight night in the distance events. After placing eighth in the 3,000-meter run Saturday, Olinger pushed to a fourth-place finish in the 5,000m Sunday in 14:15.10.
In the multi-events, junior Scott Hudepohl (Cincinnati, Ohio) closed out the heptathlon with a sixth-place standing, accumulating a total of 5,143 points.

On winning the Big Ten title …
“It was a great feeling. I came into OSU and took some lumps really hard, but I did what the coach said and I seemed to improve. Things didn’t seem to be going well, but then with the help of my coaches and teammates, I peaked just before the Big Tens. All I wanted to do was place; I didn’t expect to win at all. I just tried to stay focused and maintain a modest image, and it looks like it worked.”
On preparing for the NCAA Championships …
“I plan on going back and getting a lot of rest, because getting enough rest is just as important as working out. I just hope to work on the little things and the mechanics and hopefully, that will work out.”

By State House News Service | February 4, 2016, 17:09 EDT
BOSTON – Margaret McKenna, the embattled president of Suffolk University, and the school’s board of trustees have reached an agreement regarding her future at the downtown college, according to an announcement Thursday that came as state Attorney General Maura Healey confirmed she is seeking information from the board related to concerns over reported failures to deal with problems identified by its accrediting agency.
McKenna and Andrew Meyer, the head trustee, will present the proposed agreement to the board at a meeting Friday, according to Greg Gatlin, a Suffolk spokesman.
“President McKenna and chairman Meyer have heard the voices of the members of the Suffolk community, as well as members of the wider community who care so deeply about the future of Suffolk University. McKenna and Meyer have come together in good faith in an effort to resolve the issues in the best interests of the university,” Gatlin said in a statement.
Amidst the turmoil between trustees and McKenna and reports that she could be fired less than year after taking on the job, Healey made her inquiry regarding the university’s governance.
“There have been a number of issues raised over the last week about the way in which the board of trustees use its authority,” Healey spokeswoman Cyndi Roy Gonzales said in a statement. “Of particular concern are reports that the university’s accrediting agency cited problems with the governance structure that have gone unaddressed for several years. We have questions about the board’s course of action since those problems were identified.”
Gonzales says it is the job of the attorney general’s office to “ensure that trustees uphold their fiduciary duties” and the office is looking into those concerns and seeking information from the university’s board.
Tensions between McKenna, a former president of Leslie University in Cambridge, and Suffolk’s board spilled into the public eye this week with earlier reports that the board stood ready to oust her and bring in former Attorney General Martha Coakley as a replacement. Coakley subsequently said that she wasn’t and wouldn’t be a candidate for the job.
Gatlin said the details of the agreement reached by McKenna and Meyer are still being finalized and will be subject to approval by trustees.
“In order to preserve the confidential nature of tomorrow’s discussion and to allow the board to discuss freely the issues at hand, both President McKenna and Chairman Meyer will not release any details prior to the board meeting,” Gatlin said.
Earlier Thursday, Gov. Charlie Baker weighed in on the matter saying he hoped the two sides would come to a resolution “sooner rather than later” and added that he’s “glad” they’re working on an accord in private.
“I’m glad that they started to talk amongst themselves and I think that’s the best place for them to have this conversation,” Baker said following a groundbreaking ceremony in downtown Boston.
Boston Mayor Marty Walsh echoed the governor and voiced his support for McKenna, a former civil rights lawyer.
“I would say keep her. I mean, unless they can prove that there’s a reason that she hasn’t done her job. But for all indications I’ve seen, she’s done a very good job and she’s been there for eight months. So I don’t know how you can get an assessment of somebody’s performance after eight months,” Walsh said.

This is the tenth consecutive year the school has been included in the publication, “The Best 294 Business Schools.”
“This recognition is a testament to the quality of the programs, faculty, staff, and students at the Leighton School,” said Interim Dean P.N. Saksena. “This is especially meaningful because the criteria for making the list is based on responses from our students.”
Over 25,000 students at the 294 schools were surveyed about their school’s academics, student body, and campus life. “The Best 294 Business Schools” has two-page profiles of the schools. Each profile addresses academics, career and placement, student life and environment, and admissions. The profiles also have ratings for academic experience, admissions selectivity, and career services.
The IU South Bend profile describes the Leighton School as a “value-provider when it comes to getting an exceptional business education.” Students said they appreciated the diversity of the Leighton School faculty. They also noted that Leighton professors are “personable” and “very well-versed in the subjects they teach,” and have a “sincere interest in their students’ success.”EXCLUSIVE: Saoirse Ronan’s stylist talks red carpet dressing in the Instagram-era
Hunger meets fast-talking fashionista Elizabeth Saltzman.
[“][I] have CRAFT – Can’t Remember A Fucking Thing,” confesses Elizabeth Saltzman. The London-based super stylist is a hoot to talk to. And while fairytale dresses examined to a CSI degree could add a layer of stress factor come awards season, she appears totally unaffected by the sartorial circus. Ahead of the Academy Awards on Sunday, we caught up with the fast-talking fashionista dressing three-time Oscar nominee Saoirse Ronan (tipped to win Best Actress for her performance in the coming-of-age comedy Lady Bird this year), to talk style secrets, finding her tribe in 80s NYC and how Insta-hysteria has changed the face of fashion…
“I started as a sales person,” the former American Vogue fashion editor says – whose masterminded iconic looks for the likes of Gwyneth Paltrow to Uma Thurman. “I worked in a very cool store in New York called Parachute. A lot of people talk about the Fiorucci gang but no-one’s ever documented Parachute, I think it’s about time. Really cool people started there – like James Jebbia (founder of Supreme). Of course we were just kids working in a store, but it was very fashion forward.”
While growing up in a creative household (her father was an interior designer; mother a fashion director at Saks Fifth Avenue) she was all for making a bold statement in the big apple. “Truly, crazy dressing,” she laughs. “Plastic, see-through dresses; duck tape on my tits! I wasn’t dressing for anybody else. I was just having fun on my own door step.”
This was before the glare of social media, too, something that has undeniably changed the fashion game. There’s an immediate hyper-visibility that, up until a decade ago, never really existed on the red carpet. Saltzman herself has a 36k Instagram following, usually posting behind-the-scenes snaps of her handiwork and congratulating her A-list clientele. “I think stylists that do Instagram well are really great,” she says. “Karla Welch makes me happy – her posts are poignant. I suck at social media, I literally don’t do anything. I was with Karl Lagerfeld in Paris for a whole day, I styled a show, I was with every famous person you could imagine. You’d never know it!” Saoirse Ronan, whose worked with Saltzman for two years, bucks the social media trend of her generation altogether (“[she] isn’t into the whole thing”) although.
"I wasn’t dressing for anybody else. I was just having fun on my own door step."
That’s not to suggest Saltzman is immune to the annual “Best VS. Worst” dressed post-mortems that inevitably ensue. “I once had an all-night panic with Gwyneth [Paltrow] at the 2012 Oscars wearing a Tom Ford white dress and cape,” she says. “I was absolutely like ‘what have I done?’ The risk paid off, and is often cited as one of Paltrow’s most prized looks. Of course there’s an SOS styling kit she packs for months of awards, premieres and parties “the size of carry-on luggage”, which hold everything from seamless underwear, a range of nipple covers, electrolytes, flip flops, Panadol, static guard, Spanx and makeup sponges.
Second best is not an option on the big O-day, Saltzman says. “I try not to have a back up dress. I don’t want to keep my options open – Brides get married everyday and they don’t have backup dresses! On the day the Oscars are announced I have thoughts. I know what I’m going for [and] I try to lock in whoever I’m working with.”
"I worked in a very cool store in New York called Parachute. A lot of people talk about the Fiorucci gang but no-one’s ever documented Parachute, I think it’s about time."
Since the onset of the #MeToo and #TimesUp movements, we’ve also entered a new age in power dressing on the red carpet; using fashion as a form of protest. “There is a message [there],” Saltzman says. “You need to think about your story. Saoirse’s style is classic with a major hit of power. Debbie Harry was a big influence on my mood board. She’s just trying to be individual and not follow the rules.” Empowering women to look at themselves in a new light is very important to Saltzman. “The first thing Saoirse said to me was: ‘I’m not really into pink and I don’t do sparkles.’ I was like, ‘Good, try this Chanel sweater on.’ It was a pink, sequinned top. That’s the same with Gwyneth saying ‘ I don’t wear red.’ Usually people don’t like what suits them because it’s that ‘opposites attract’ thing on the skin.
“I want the person I’m dressing to feel like the best versions of themselves,” Saltzman states. “I don’t ‘do’ fashion. I think what I do is I give people style, I figure out who they are and play to their strengths. I’m so flipping lucky to do what I do [but I] also recognise we’re not dealing with brain surgery here. We’re trying to make the world a better place, in the slightest way.”For cattle producers, bull sale season has arrived. Prospective buyers are flipping through the sale catalogs and studying the pedigree information, performance data and bull pictures trying to determine where they want to make their investment.
As genomic advancements have progressed, cattle producers have more information than ever before to help with their selections. But for some, all that data can be overwhelming and make it difficult to know what information they should prioritize.
Experts at Kansas State University’s Beef Cattle Institute addressed data-driven bull selection during a recent podcast to help cattle producers sort through the data. Dan Moser, president of Angus Genetics, Inc., joined the Kansas State team and offered the following advice.
Genetic Priorities on Data
“Focus first on the economic indexes,” Moser said. He explained that an index is a number that combines trait EPDs (Expected Progeny Differences, which are an estimate of the animal’s genetic merit for a given trait compared to other animals) weighted by their economic impact.
K-State beef extension specialist Bob Weaber cautioned buyers to align with the right index for their operation.
“One of the biggest mistakes producers make with indexes is that they select bulls on one index, but raise the calves under a different scenario,” Weaber said.
Moser explained it further by citing the terminal index. “Think about it as a steer index because it combines growth and carcass traits, but does not include maternal traits such as calving ease and cow longevity,” he said.
In a scenario where those who are raising cattle don’t retain ownership through the cattle feeding phase or participate in a feeder cattle marketing program that documents carcass merit there may not be a benefit to selecting on the terminal index because the cow/calf producer isn’t getting paid a premium on the calves
While studying the data is an important part of the buying process, Weaber recommends producers do a visual inspection of the cattle.
“While we are improving EPDs and indexes, it is still important to look at the cattle for structural issues so you know that the bulls are sound and will be able to service cows for a long time,” he said.
The experts also agreed that there is some data that producers can discard.
“Don’t focus on the actual weights and measures because those have already been included in the EPDs,” Moser said. Weaber added that the buyer needs to confirm with the seedstock operator that all of the actual data has been turned into their respective breed association so that the purchaser is assured of accurate data.
“I advise commercial buyers to extend that review of data to the dams of the bulls in consideration,” Moser said. “If you are going to base your selections on indexes and EPDs, which you should, then you also need to be working with seedstock producers who are the complete recorders and submitters of the data.”
Bull-to-Cow Ratio
As producers plan for their upcoming bull purchases, it is advisable that they know what the breeding demands of that sire will be. Age of the bull, terrain, length of the breeding season are just some factors for consideration when trying to estimate that number according to veterinarian Bob Larson.
“The national average is one mature bull for every 30 cows,” Larson said.
Weaber added that yearling bulls will not be able to breed as many cows in season as mature bulls. “Figure out how many months old the bull is at turnout and then follow the rule of one cow per bull for each month of his age,” he said.
Larson also stressed the importance of watching the bulls closely during breeding season to look for signs of their inability to mate.
If there are breeding challenges during the season, Weaber and Larson said that the relationship with seedstock producers in the area will be of importance.
Other Bull Buying Considerations
“Most commercial producers will buy cattle within a 100-mile radius of their ranch. I encourage them to get to know their seedstock vendors in their area,” Weaber said. “Get sale catalogs and go look at bulls at a variety of places, and evaluate how those seedstock producers can service your needs.”
Moser added that it is also a good idea for the prospective buyer to visit the ranch of the seedstock supplier outside of the sale day.
“Seedstock producers have high value animals. As the buyer you want to make sure they raise cattle in a similar way to how you do,” he said.
Larson added that commercial customers should consider the services provided by the seedstock operator when making that purchase.
“A lot of breeders provide transportation services but some will provide even more like helping you market your feeder calves and providing connections with others in the cattle chain,” he said.
Moser added: “Write a job description for your bull and then make sure is he qualified for the one you write.”

Wondering how you got an email from outside your district? Or from an invalid email address? These questions and others can be answered by looking at the Contact Form Submission Data - meaning, what the person actually typed into the Contact Form on your website.
Why Is This Important?
Fireside does not automatically update constituent data based on what constituents type into the Contact Form - that would be a huge security risk and potentially open the door to hackers scrambling Members' databases. Rather, Fireside allows you to check the Submission Data in case there might be a need to update the information on a constituent's profile.
For instance, if you get an email in your Inbox and the address associated with that person indicates they live out of district, you may wonder how they got through the zip code authentication on the Contact Form. Once you check the Submission Data, however, you may find out that the person moved to a new address within your district, which is how they made it past the verification.
Similarly, if Fireside has an email address flagged as invalid, and yet it appears a constituent has emailed you from that address, check the Submission Data - they may have typed a different email address into the Contact Form, which now gives you the opportunity to update the old, invalid email to the new, valid one!
How to Check Contact Form Submission Data
Once an email is logged, you can check the Submission Data by going into that piece of mail, whether it resides in a Batch or is assigned to someone as Unbatched.
1. From either the Batches or My Mail pages, select your piece of mail by clicking on the Constituent's name.
2. Once you have opened the individual mail record, click More > "Show contact form submission"
3. This will produce a popup box that displays all information entered by the constituent when filling out the Contact Form.
As you see here, the information the constituent entered into the Contact Form is different than what Fireside had on record, so it's time to update this constituent's profile with his new contact info!

Canada’s Pixielocks, the colorful YouTube sensation stole your hearts to snatched two crowns! Have you seen her amazing YouTube videos? If not, you’re missing out!
Pixielocks is an avid viewer of NHK World’s program “Kawaii International,” and if you watch carefully, past Kawaii Leaders Kelly Eden and Beckii make appearances on her YouTube channel.
At the age of 12, Pixielocks saw her first episode of Sailor Moon and her love for anime, Japanese culture, and kawaii fashion blossomed.
Hailing from Prince Edward Island, Canada’s smallest province, her bright magical girl style draws a lot of attention but the attention doesn’t faze her because fashion is her greatest passion. She makes a lot of her own clothing and will begin studying fashion design, as a full-time student, in September.
To everyone that voted for me, I am so appreciative and thank you all so much. This means so much to me because Kawaii International, and everyone who voted, are giving me the opportunity to realize so many of my dreams.

Kawaii International ＃81 「It’s a Small Kawaii World」Ronnie and Natale’s Southern Utah Cabin wedding was truly one for the books. Nestled in the mountains above Cedar City in Duck Creek Village. There is something so incredibly special about being able to photograph a wedding of two people whom you care deeply for. Even more so to be part of the entire progression of their relationship. I was stoked to photograph Ronnie proposing to Natale on the ferry in 2015.
This Sunday brunch wedding blew my socks off. The bride wore her mother’s wedding dress, modified for a modern style of course. Friends and family helped make the ceremony background of hundreds of folded paper cones. Friends and family also gathered the wood stumps and logs to create the ceremony seating in the wooded area behind the cabin where the reception was to be held. Friends also worked a long night and all morning on waffles with lemon curd from scratch. The best man and maid of honor tag teamed the ceremony while the groom had assistance from a few guests with his vows, my self-included.
The bride and groom actually forged each other’s rings, “We took classes at an with a machinist that makes rings the “old school” way and we literally melted them down and worked with machines to make them. I even engraved his by hand rather than with a laser.” Those white balls that hung from the trees were hand made. The menus and invitations were typed with a typewriter flower crowns and bouquet, were made the night before by the girls and they grew a lot of the flowers and greenery themselves. The center pieces were made up with succulents they had to keep alive for months.
The day started off with the bride getting ready by lantern light in her parent’s cabin for the sunrise first look. The first look was held at 9000 ft elevation at a beautiful point surrounded by red rock and you could see Zion canyon off in the distance.
So, so grateful for such a fun weekend with my friends and to be a part of this wonderful weekend of these two beautiful souls. Thanks, Ron & Nat. <3SYDNEY, Dec. 13 (Xinhua) -- Port Moresby's National Capital District (NCD) in Papua New Guinea (PNG) will be soon take hold of 30 China-aid buses for its public transport network, PNG Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) Minister Justin Tkatchenko told local media on Thursday.
Gifted the buses to ferry officials and media personnel during November's APEC meeting, the historic event was deemed a major success for the entire South Pacific region.
While the event has now concluded, Tkatchenko believes the benefits of hosting the summit will remain for many years to come, the National Newspaper reported.
"Out of the 50 China aid-donated buses, 30 will be given to NCD for their public transport," he said.
"Others will be distributed to the National Airport Corporation for transportation, some might be given to Lae city authority."
According to Tkatchenko, a number of charity organizations, schools and other institutions had also requested consideration for the vehicles.
"Once the APEC Authority winds down everything on Dec. 31, they will announce those buses for the institutions to use properly and for the correct purpose," he said.
"They were drawing up a final list of all assets donated for the APEC meeting, (including) other vehicles such as the Maserati and Bentley cars that had also been handed out."We know that little hands get everywhere (large ones too!), so our Mucky Mitts Spray is the perfect thing to keep them feeling fresh and fantastic.

To create awareness of this situation, the Sri Lanka College of Pulmonologists, in partnership with Cipla, will kick-off #saveyourlungskandy movement, commencing on 5 June, World Environment Day, to educate the citizens of Kandy about the harmful effects of air pollutants on public health.
Included in the #saveyourlungskandy movement is a first-of-its-kind helpline. People from Kandy, and its adjoining regions, can call that number and talk to experts about their respiratory problems. Additionally, free lung health checks will be available on 5 June at Bogambara Grounds.
It is noteworthy that, according to recent publications, since the average traffic movement in Kandy is very slow, there is a level of particulate matter (PM10) of 89 micrograms per cubic metre in some parts of Kandy. This is highly alarming.
However, there is a very low awareness among the population about the effects of air pollution and acute-chronic consequences of these effects on their respiratory system. Many still tend to ignore the symptoms and may be clueless about the problems.
The #saveyourlungskandy movement is an attempt to address this lack of awareness about harmful respiratory problems resulting from pollution. And it’s slowly poisoning the health of Kandy’s citizens. The success of #saveyourlungskandy will lie in making people understand the preventive measures and trigger factors of pollution related lung disease, and urging them to get it addressed at the nearest health clinic.Brownson offers a vibrant music program for children of all ages.

More and more companies want to reduce the carbon footprint of their products. A new collaboration between Stena Aluminium and Comptech gives customers access to aluminium alloys with much lower carbon emissions and at lower costs.
Comptech's proprietary Rheocasting technology combined with Stena Aluminium's 100 % recycled aluminium enables gains in both emissions and costs while meeting customers' requirements for different alloys.
“The need for alloys with a lower carbon footprint is increasing as more and more companies are looking for ways to reduce their products' carbon footprint, while at the same time the companies' development departments need alloys with high mechanical properties," says Erik Petré, Sales & Marketing Manager at Stena Aluminium.
Comptech supplies equipment for so-called semi-solid casting based on their own process, Rheocasting, to foundries. Rheocasting achieves high mechanical properties and high thermal conductivity. Components made with the process offer several cost and environmental benefits.
“In addition, carbon dioxide emissions can be further reduced, from already low levels, by optimizing the alloying process. This is possible, for example, by working on adjusting the silicon content of an alloy," says Erik Petré.
“Our technology also enables casting with less press capacity for the same product size and thus also lower costs,” says Staffan Zetterström Sales & Marketing Manager Comptech.
Average emissions in Europe from primary aluminium are around 7 tonnes of CO2e per tonne of aluminium produced.
The average emissions from Stena Aluminium's aluminium are 0.7 tonnes CO2e per tonne of aluminium produced, of which silicon accounts for about 40 % of the 0.7 tonnes CO2e.

Comptech is a technology supplier to the foundry industry where the main products are machine equipment and know-how for semi-solid casting. Customers are major automotive and telecom equipment manufacturers. The rollout of the process started in 2019 and today the process is found on three continents.

Association between high penetrance cancer susceptibility mutations and clonal hematopoiesis
Lay summary
Recent studies in healthy individuals have shown that as we age, it is common to develop changes in our DNA. This commonly occurs in the blood and is called clonal hematopoiesis (CH). CH is associated with an elevated risk of blood cancers, cardiovascular disease and other diseases. We know that the likelihood of developing CH is in part inherited (passed down from our parents) . Understanding how inherited genetics influences CH would provide insight into the biology of the earliest stages of blood cancer formation. Here we will use the UK Biobank data to identify genes that predispose healthy people to develop CH.Musselburgh Art Club have had to cancel their joint evening with us this Thursday, 8th March.

Sparing a child from the physical, cognitive, behavioral, and emotional problems associated with maltreatment2-6 is intuitively and morally preferable to intervening after the fact. ++ Beyond the individual child, the prevention of child maltreatment has at its heart the goal of strengthening families and enhancing childrearing. Effective interventions may achieve much more than the narrow goal of preventing maltreatment. Additional outcomes may include children’s cognitive, emotional, social, and behavioral gains; improved maternal health and communication with their children; decreased use of public assistance; and decreased involvement in the criminal justice system.7-10 Child maltreatment has significant costs, human and economic, that need to be weighed against the cost of prevention. Although more research is needed, several studies have demonstrated the cost effectiveness of specific child abuse prevention programs.11-13 ++ To date, pediatric practice has focused primarily on the important issues of identifying abuse and neglect, reporting to the public agencies, and facilitating referrals for assessment and treatment. In order to fulfill their responsibility to help ensure children’s health and well-being, pediatricians should also focus on preventing maltreatment. Pediatricians can do so by identifying and helping to manage child and family risk and protective factors, referring families to effective community-based services, and advocating for the development of policies and funding of programs that effectively promote family well-being. Because children and families generally enjoy excellent relationships with primary care pediatricians, pediatricians may play a role that other professionals cannot. Pediatricians are usually perceived as supportive and caring without the stigma often attached to social work and mental health. This rapport can facilitate a remarkable entrée into families’ lives with sharing of much sensitive information. ++ Risk Factors for Maltreatment ++ The “ecological” framework of child maltreatment posits that physically abusive and/or neglectful behavior derives from the complex set of interactions between the child, parent, community, and society.14 Specific patterns of behavior observed within the parent-child dyad can serve as important indicators of possible physical abuse or neglect. Child characteristics, such as difficult temperament or chronic physical or mental health problems, may challenge parents, heighten parental stress, and increase the risk of maltreatment.15,16 The relationship between parent and child in maltreating families may involve harsh, inattentive, and inconsistent parenting.17 Maltreating parents, particularly physically abusive ones, often report feeling “out of control” as parents. They frequently hold an external locus of control orientation, feeling that they have limited control over their actions.17-19 For a more detailed discussion of risk factors, see Chapter 35. ++ ResearchThe market exit looks more crowded than a Who concert in Cincinnati.
Judging from today’s early morning read of the global markets bonds are being sold off hard across the board as yields climb to levels in Asia and Europe that have not been seen in years. All major bond indices across the globe have yields climbing higher lead by the German 10-year bund, which hit 0.54%, a level not seen since the end of 2015.
The spill over to global stock sell off began in Asia tepidly, but is ramping up across Europe and as the US eyes its opening bell in the red.
It appears all this cash is moving into commodities as crude oil, natural gas and precious metals are all moving higher.
The impetus for the market moves seem to be coming before the ECB releases its minutes from its June meetings. Since the Fed minutes on Wednesday had little information on the timing of its selling off some of its balance sheet assets, investors are looking for direction and timing from the ECB.

MalayAltered States Are Normal
Although mainstream culture primarily supports an awareness of consensus reality, all three levels of awareness are in fact influencing you daily, even if you don’t know it. The decisions you make, your relationships, your physical and mental health – are all directly influenced (consciously or unconsciously) by consensus reality, dreamland, and essence awareness.
Altered states are a normal part of being human, and the wisdom and spice from each state of awareness makes up the whole that is uniquely you.
Consciously interacting with your altered states allows you more freedom of expression in the world, gives you greater access to your own power, wisdom, talents, and gifts – and makes it easier and more fun to be YOU.
Marginalizing States of Awareness
Because modern society uses consensus reality as a baseline for what is real, linear thinking tends to override the dreaming and essence aspects of our awareness.
Through out your life you probably received training in how to be conscious of consensus reality (cultivating awareness of your body, of objects, and memorizing facts about science and numbers). You probably did not get as much training in how to be conscious of dreamland (cultivating awareness of symbolic thinking, communing with nature, being fluid with the roles you embody in relationships). It is likely that you received even less training in how to cultivate an experience of essence (who you are without a body, what lies beyond what your senses can observe, how to hang-out comfortably in the unknown, or the great mystery of life).
Marginalizing any one state of reality limits our experience of life.The term e-mail forwarding refers to an email being forwarded from a receiving address to a third-party address which isn't mentioned as a receiver. For example, a client sends out an email from their personal mail box to support@domain.com and as much as they're concerned, it is the single recipient. When there is an active forwarding, the message may be sent to owner@domain.com, for instance, although the customer never meant the message to be sent there and may not be aware about the presence of this mail box. There are various purposes for applying such forwarding. For instance, if you've several emails you're able to forward each of them to a one email address, which will make keeping track of email messages easier and will allow you to collect emails and respond in a timely manner. The function can also be used if a number of people should get a copy of an e mail message delivered to a standard mail box.Periodontal disease, also known as gum disease, are serious bacterial infections of the tissues surrounding and supporting the teeth. This includes gums, bone and the fibers that support your teeth and hold them in the jaw, known as periodontal ligaments.
These bacterial infections can basically destroy your gums as well as the supporting bone that holds your teeth in your mouth.
The result of extreme, untreated periodontal disease is teeth that loosen and fall out, or need to be removed and replaced with dental bridges or implants. Additionally, you may require periodontal plastic surgery to cover and protect exposed tooth root surfaces, correct gum and jawbone indentations or reshape and repair the gum tissue. You may also require dental implants to replace destroyed tooth roots.
Additionally, periodontal disease has been linked to a number of health problems that extend far beyond your mouth including diabetes and heart disease. According to the American Academy of Period-ontology:
.”
The Good News
Put simply, periodontal disease is entirely preventable through good dental habits. Additionally, periodontal disease is repairable through good dental habits.
You may have gum disease and not even know it. Often, there is no pain and periodontal diseases may not exhibit symptoms until serious bone loss has taken place. It is critical to see Dr. Hadaegh of Beverly Hills if you are experiencing any of these symptoms.
• Red, swollen or tender gums
• Gums that bleed easily when brushing or flossing
• Gums that pull away from teeth
• Loose or separating teeth
• Pus between gums and teeth
• Persistent bad breath
• Change in your bite and/or in the fit of removable dentures
What to Do
Educate Yourself – We have provided additional information on this serious disease below. Please make yourself aware the potential issues relating to gum disease and follow the best recommendations for avoiding this serious health problem.
Make an Appointment – If you have concerns, are experiencing any of the symptoms described here, or if you haven’t had a dentist visit within the last six to eight months, please contact our office today and we will make certain you are on the path to dental health.
Causes of Periodontal Disease
The primary cause of periodontal diseases is bacterial plaque, that sticky, colorless coating that forms on your teeth. If it’s not cleaned off – through good habits including regular dental cleanings – that bacterial plaque can infect the gums, release toxins that redden and inflame the tissue, and gradually destroy the tissues supporting the teeth and underlying bone. When this happens, the gums separate from the teeth, forming pockets that fill with even more plaque and cause additional infection.
Other factors that can affect the health of your gums:
Dental Issues. Decayed teeth, broken or badly fitting partial dentures, crowded/crooked teeth and improperly filled teeth can “trap” the built up plaque, making it difficult to remove by at home brushing and flossing.
Health Problems. People with diseases such as diabetes and leukemia, on certain medications or with systemic conditions such as human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection, malnutrition or immunosuppression, may be especially vulnerable to gum disease due to lower resistance levels.
Lifestyle Issues. Poor personal oral health practices such as smoking, drug and/or alcohol abuse, and even oral piercings can contribute to periodontal disease. Additionally, stress and poor nutritional habits can weaken your body’s ability to fight off the infections that cause periodontal disease.
Hormonal Factors. Hormonal fluctuations during a woman’s key life stages – puberty, pregnancy and menopause – can trigger tissue changes in the mouth, thus increasing the possibility that a woman will develop periodontal disease.
Genetics. Genes and family history can indicate a predisposition for developing periodontal diseases.
Tobacco Use. Tobacco use is a serious contributor to periodontal disease. Continued tobacco use after periodontal treatment can impeded the healing process and diminish the likelihood of success. Smokeless tobacco is also a danger – users of this form of tobacco are at higher risk of developing oral cancer.
Medications. Certain medicines such as oral contraceptives, antidepressants and some heart medicines can adversely affect your gum health.
Types of Periodontal Diseases
Periodontal diseases and conditions include:
Gingivitis
An inflammation of the gums surrounding the teeth, gingivitis is the mildest form of periodontal disease. At this stage, there is typically no discomfort. If not properly treated, it may progress to periodontists.
Chronic Periodontitis
The most common form of periodontitis is chronic periodontitis, which results in inflammation within the supporting tissues of the teeth, progressive attachment and bone loss. It is diagnosed by bone loss (through dental X-rays), pocket formation and/or gum recession. It typically affects adults who are 35 or older, but it can occur at any age. Attachment loss may progress slowly, but periods of rapid progression also can occur.
Aggressive Periodontitis
Less common is aggressive periodontitis, which is characterized by rapid attachment loss and bone destruction. Localized aggressive periodontitis most often occurs near puberty and usually involves attachment loss around first molars and/or front teeth. Generalized aggressive periodontitis usually affects people under 30 years old and involves attachment loss on three or more permanent teeth as well as first molars and incisors.
Systemic Periodontitis
Periodontitis stemming from systemic diseases often begins at a young age. It is associated with systemic conditions such as heart disease, respiratory problems and diabetes.
Necrotizing Periodontal Disease
Necrotizing periodontal disease is an infection characterized by the death of cells in the gingival tissues, periodontal ligament and alveolar bone (part of the upper or lower jaw that contains roots of teeth). It most commonly occurs in patients with systemic conditions such as Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) infection, malnutrition and immunosuppression. These types of periodontal diseases cause ulcers in the gums between the teeth. Stress, smoking and poor oral hygiene sometimes can contribute to this problem.Jonathan Apgar

The actual wedding day is the Bersanding. This literally means the “sitting together of the bride and bridegroom on the bridal couch, which resembles a throne (Pelamin)”.
Two pelamins are required – one in the bride’s house and the other in the bridegroom’s.
As the Bersanding ceremony customarily takes place in the afternoon, the bridegroom entertains guests at his own house in the morning.
At the agreed time, he is escorted in a procession with a male music group (hadrah or kompang band) to his Bride’s house.
On arrival, he has to pay the “entrance fee” to the Bride’s family before he enters each door leading to the pelamin to take his place besides his bride.
An astakona, a multi-tiered pedestalled tray, is also placed in front of the pelamin. Each tier contains a mound of cooked yellow rice studded all over with red-dyed eggs. This tray will later be presented to the emak pengantin (a close friend or relative chosen to be the matron of honour for the marriage) as an act of appreciation for her help during the ceremonies.
The Groom then sits with the Bride on the pelamin and the relatives will sprinkle petals and rice (which symbolises fertility) on the couple.
The music proclaims their marriage to the world. At the Groom’s house, the Bersanding ceremony is repeated for the benefit of the Groom’s relatives. This is followed by feasting and merry-making, called the kenduri. The wedding celebrations come to an end when the bridal pair returns home to the Bride’s house to pay respects to her family.

Anirudh Dave has started shooting for the Colors TV show. Shakti Astitva Ke Ehsaas Ki is a social drama based on the lives of transgenders. It stars Jigyasa Singh and Kamya Punjabi in lead roles.
ANIRUDH DAVE STARTS SHOOTING FOR SHAKTI ASTITVA KE EHSAAS KI
Anirudh Dave, who was last seen on Lockdown Ki Love Story, confirmed bagging Shakti Astitva Ke Ehsaas Ki. He said, "Yes, I am playing a transgender in the show and have already started shooting for it." Anirudh will be seen playing a transperson on the show. He added, "There is a lot of stigmas associated with transgenders in our society. But we must not forget that they are human beings, just like anyone else, and not different from others. It’s a very performance-oriented show with a huge fan following. When I was offered the role and the character was narrated to me, there was no question of saying ‘no’ or having second thoughts."
I AM NOT PLAYING A REGULAR TRANSGENDER: ANIRUDH DAVE
Anirudh's look on the show will be different from the other transperson portrayed on the show before. Talking about the same, he said, "I am not playing a regular transgender, which we generally see on-screen, wearing big bindi and sindoor with heavy sarees. I play a male eunuch and the look is inspired by the concept of Ardhnarishwar. So, you will see me wearing western dresses teamed up with an Indian look. It’s a kind of mix and match."
Anirudh has played various roles on television. Talking about playing a transperson, he said, "I have done a variety of roles and played both the antagonist and protagonist in various shows. If an actor justifies his role, his audience accepts him with open arms. So, while accepting this show, the question of acceptance never came to me. I personally feel that when the audience emotionally connects with the character, they accept him whole-heartedly. I am sure that I am not going to disappoint my audience and they will shower their love and blessings when they see me in this role."
WHO IS ANIRUDH DAVE?
Anirudh Dave made his acting debut with Rajkumar Aaryyan on NDTV Imagine (now a defunct channel). He was later seen on Woh Rehne Waali Mehlon Ki, Phulwa and Ruk Jana Nahi. He rose to popularity as Inspector Hanuman Singh on Patiala Babes. Anirudh has also done a few films. He will soon be seen in Akshay Kumar-starrer Bell Bottoms.

Changes in our District
February 12, 2015
ln recent months, we have discussed, planned, and generated change within the fire district. Thank you for your input, time, and energy through these processes. ln an effort to maintain open communications, I ask a few minutes of your time, to share current information. The Board of Commissioners has moved us forward, with a planned organizational model projected out to 2018. The desired organizational model has a built-in objective of four on-duty personnel, around the clock. We expect this to offer a safer workplace; adequate personnel at hand to carry out our mission, and maintain our vision to stop fire at the room of origin, save more lives, and do so with a long-term effective financial model.
A renewed resident program is ready to market target audiences, we have new requirements for volunteers, and our current operational model requires review with you. In 2010, we averaged four personnel responding for medical aid incidents, and an average of seven responders for motor vehicle incidents. Over the past four years, our numbers of personnel available have declined. Currently, we average two personnel per incident, while acknowledging 20% of the calls in 2014, were handled by a single responder. Think about this for a minute, last year, 206 incidents were handled by one of us. This brings about safety issues, for our community, and to the men and women of District #4.
The resident firefighter program has been redesigned, offering a modest stipend, tuition assistance, and many levels of training and experience. We will be casting a regional and national net to advertise our district. Our partners at North Mason Fire Authority (through grants) have offered their assistance with job fairs, VA programs, and regional public gatherings. We always need your help, sharing opportunities for our youth, and your neighbors. We currently have five resident positions available, with private rooms. To read more.….

The Gloster Gladiator was one of those airplanes that, while outdated when it went into service, managed to hold the line until more modern aircraft became available. Having the distinction of being the last fighter biplanes in British service, they held their own against their Italian opposition in the Western Desert, primarily because of their rugged design and highly trained pilots, who used tactics that helped them to survive against more modern monoplanes. Of course, when the Hurricanes and Spitfires became available, the Gladiators were relegated to second line duties, where they were very useful until the end of World War II.
In addition to Royal Air Force and Navy service, the Gladiator was used by the air forces of Belgium, China, Egypt, Erie, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Iraq, Latvia, Lithuania, Norway, Portugal, Russia, and Sweden, although some of these countries used examples captured from their previous owners. Nevertheless, the Gladiator served faithfully all over the world, and it is surprising that so few survive today.
I had read several of the author's previous Mushroom publications, including those on the Hart, Fury, Bulldog, and Gauntlet, so I knew what to expect. I expected a well-written, complete, detailed history of the type, along with excellent detail drawings, color illustrations, and photographs, and that's what I got. It kind of reminded me of a "big print" edition, since the previous books had drawings in "real scale", 1/72, whereas this book is much larger, containing drawings in 1/48 scale, and although the type is not noticeably larger, there is a lot more information presented than in previous publications. The author did some very thorough research for this book, including tables showing the entire service history and final disposition of each airplane, squadron service records, and claimed kills over enemy aircraft. There is a wealth of information here on the Gladiator, and anyone interested in the type should certainly obtain this book.
The book provides a very detailed and complete narrative history of the type's development and service use. Although a few of the photos were familiar, most were not. Many were of the personal type, people in front of airplanes, wreck photos, etc., but all would be useful in modeling. In fact, after thoroughly reading this book, I feel that this is probably the definitive work on the Gladiator. There will be a volume two, which I would assume would contain more photos and color drawings of the Gladiator in Royal Air Force and Royal Navy service, as the emphasis in this volume seemed to be on foreign Gladiator operations, especially in the color drawing section. The flyer stated that volume two will include a full technical description, detail photos, and information on surviving examples, making this two volume set indispensable to the serious modeler.
This is an excellent publication, and anyone interested in modeling the Gladiator in any scale should obtain this book, and probably volume two, as a reference. Get one while you can. Then get out those old Matchbox, Frog, and Heller Gladiator kits and get cracking.

Format: Soft back, 272 pages, an abundance of black and white photographs, English text, 1:48 scale drawings of Gladiator variants and a colour section of side views.
A quite comprehensive tome on the development and operational history of the Gladiator. This book is not aimed specifically at the modeller, although there is a wealth of photographs in black and white which show some of the many schemes carried by the Gladiator. Unfortunately there is nothing to aid the super-detailers all photographs being of complete aircraft.
If you are interested in the history of the Gladiator however, there is much here to inform and educate. In the Operational History section the detail goes down to the level of individual claims by pilots in all squadrons which used the Gladiator. There is a breakdown of production and users, also comprehensive. The final section is a selection of colour side views, although, disappointingly, only one of these relates to an aircraft in British use. If you are a fan of the Gladiator then this book is for you.

Product Article by Nick Moore on Jan 26 2011
Alex Crawford writes this first Volume in Mushroom’s telling of the Gloster Gladiator story. This and the follow-up Volume are the culmination of 25 years of research into the Gladiator so it is abundantly clear that Crawford is a devotee of the subject. Widely researched and with an impressive bibliography, this book comes in at 272 pages. It is supported by interesting photographs and excellent colour profiles by Artur Juszczak, of which you receive no less than sixteen.
In the main the text deals with the Gladiator’s active service with the RAF. This is followed by a separate history of the Sea Gladiator and finally the Gladiator’s Foreign Service is described.. A testimony to the quality of the Gladiator can be seen in the colour profiles at the rear of the book. This aircraft saw service under a great many flags and the Foreign Service section of the book describes their use by a great many countries. The photographs in this section in particular are quite fascinating for the variety of markings, crews and environments the Gladiator appears in and alongside of.
The book as a whole contains a number of very good photographs showing the Gladiator from many points of view. Some will prove especially useful to modelers as they show weathering on the airframe to great advantage. Many photographs show crew, uniforms and the bases the planes flew from. The book is interspersed with 1:48 scale line drawings showing various plans and elevations of Gladiators Mark I, Mark II, Sea Gladiator that also include equipment variations.
Tabled information at the end of the book includes operational data for all RAF Gladiator units and victory claims.
I’ll just make a comment regards the attached photographs in this article. As you all appreciate, Mushroom will have gone to a great deal of effort to produce this book and are entitled to copyright protection. The images reproduced here are of low quality to give you an idea of what the book contains. The photos and drawings in the book are of much better quality so if you want to see them all – you’ll just have to buy it!
An indispensable book for Gladiator fans but also well recommended to anyone interested in the campaigns they participated in or for interwar aircraft enthusiasts.

Mushroom Models Publications (MMP) is a publishing company based in in Redbourn, Herts, UK. They are patnered with Stratus Puglications in Sandomierz, Poland, where they are printed in English. The book is available from MMP.
This new book is in soft-cover format of 272 pages. Of all the aircraft books I have received in the past from MMP, this one has the MOST pages ever.
The pages are of 8 ¼” x 11 ¾” size.
The book describes the design, development and operational history of the Gloster Gladiator, the last biplane fighter used by the RAF. Developed from the Gauntlet, the Gladiator entered squadron service in February 1937. Although essentially obsolete even then, with the Hurricane and Spitfire also coming into service, Gladiators served with many RAF squadrons at home and abroad, and was drafted into service as a carrier-based fighter by the Fleet Air Arm. In British service the Gladiator had significant front-line wartime service, and remained on second-line duties until 1945.
The Gladiator was used by a wide selection of air arms before and during WWII, and saw active service with many of them, from African desert sands to the Arctic wastes of northern Finland. The full operational history of the type is described and illustrated in this boo, which is a major update of Alex Crawford’s best-selling earlier edition from MMP. So much extra information has come to light and been included in this present work that it has had to be extended into two volumes, and in larger format. This second book will be titled “Gloster Gladiator, Vol. 2, The Survivors in Detail” and available in the future from MMP.
In volume 1, the design, development and history of the Gladiator is described, with 1/48th scale line drawings (9 of them-some as multi-views) and a 184 black and white wartime photos (mostly of Gladiators, with a few of their pilots thrown in for good measure). There are no less than 58 pages of data lists at the rear of the book and 14 full color profile illustrations. These are (one each) side profiles of Gladiators in service with:
RAF
Belgian Air Force
Chinese Air Force
Royal Egyptian Air ForceIrish Air Force
Finish Air Force
Free French Air Force
Captured Luftwaffe
Greek Air Force
Lithuanian Air Force
Norwegian Air Force
Portugeuse Air Force
Lithuanian Air Force
Swedish Air Force
The cover art is a color shot of the second production Gladiator K6131, during a pre-delivery test flight. This aircraft was delivered to 72 Squadron on 22 February 1937. It served for just over a year before being wrecked in a forced landing. This photo is repeated again, in black and white on page 7.
The back cover of the book has a color photo of a close-up of he plaque that was fitted to F/Lt. Joe Fraser’s Gladiator. The Greek text on it read “Slow but steady”. At the top were a row of X’s that indicated Fraser’s claims, while the X’s at the bottom indicated either damaged or probable kills. There is also a color shot of the cover art for the second future volume of the Gladiator book.
In volume 2, the technical specifications, details of surviving airframes and more color schemes will be presented as well as scale plans and many photos. These 2 volumes, together, will represent the most detailed coverage of this classic biplane fighter available, and invaluable resource for aviation enthusiasts, historians and modelers.
I want to thank Dr. Roger M. Wallsgrove, Editor-in-Chief of MMP…and Stratus for this review sample. Very highly recommended.

Reviewer: Scott Van Aken
Once again, the folks at Mushroom Models Publications have provided us with what amounts to a tome, this time the initial volume on a favorite of many, the Gloster Gladiator. This is one of those British fighters that was the end of the line for a type. In this case, the biplane. Developed from the very popular and similar Gauntlet, the Gladiator was about as modern as it could get with an enclosed cockpit and four machine guns. It entered service just before the Spitfire and about the same time as the Hurricane. It was well received by those who flew it and went on to be the main type for many RAF units. It also served with the FAA and a number of foreign countries.
Being developed and available at a time of great tension in the world, it was not unusual that there would be a demand for the type. With Germany re-arming and war seemingly inevitable, many nations were scrambling to bolster their defenses. Many looked to the Gladiator to help do that. When war came, the Gladiator was to be found on all fronts from Norway to North Africa where it put up a gallant defense against generally more modern aircraft. It was the Mediterranean where it was the most effective as the Italians were not quite a well equipped as were the Germans. The type soldiered on throughout the war in second line units, being the main type for many Meteorological Flights.
Mushroom Models tells the full story of the development of the Gladiator and the different variants that were developed. This volume also covers the many nations that used the type from Belgium to Sweden and many in between.At 2722 pages, this is a very large softcover book and a lot of space is needed to tell the story. The first 196 pages are the historical background and unit use. These are chock full of superbly chosen photographs. Some may be old friends, but many are new to me and clearly printed. . The rest of the book are appendices such as a production list, what aircraft flew with what squadrons, a detailed listing of air to air claims and several pages of very large color profiles and three views; one for each country that flew the type. Many more are to come in the second volume.
I would have to say that this has to be amongst the best aircraft history and reference books of the year. I know I have said this before, but you simply cannot go wrong with a Mushroom Models Publication book. It is really that good.May 2009

Unlike the Orange series which is more destined to modellers, the White Series is made for historians first, even if we can find 1/72nd scale plans and representative artwork for every country. As Alex Crawford’s main field of interest is the British biplanes, we could be certain that the job would be well done, and actually it is. There are 270 pages in the book, and around 200 are reserved for the development and history of the Gladiator all around the world. Of course, the British part is the most important, and many combat reports are giving a valuable primary source for this aircraft. More than 200 photos illustrate the book, some being pretty rare (like the Baltic or Soviet Gladiators) and seen for the first time. The career of the Gladiator for each country is complete as far it can be, even if more could be expected for the career of the Swedish Gladiators.
The rest of the book is reserved for the appendices. The first and main one is the list of all Gladiators in Commonwealth service. Even if this can be useful, 40 pages for this list can be seen as a bit too big, as not a single photograph comes to illustrate this part. But the full list of claims is very interesting but surprisingly only the British claims are detailed.
Nevertheless, the book is a good value and bring something new to the Gloster Gladiator bibliography, and this at a very reasonable price. A second volume (containing a full technical description, more colour profile and much more) is under preparation, but no need to wait for it to make a good deal in purchasing the volume one today, and I do recommend the book without hesitation.Phil Listemann

The Gloster Gladiator was the last biplane fighter used by the RAF.
It was developed from the Gauntlet but by the time it entered service in February 1937, obsolescence had set in. Despite this, the Gladiator served with many RAF squadrons both home and abroad and even spent time in the Fleet Air Arm.
Many other countries used this aircraft as well, which saw it fly in areas as diverse as the sands of Africa and the Arctic ice of Finland.A
lex Crawford wrote an earlier book on the Gladiator which was a best-seller in its own right. As a result of a lot of new information, we have this expanded edition which is not only in a larger format but has to be extended to 2 volumes.
Consequently this issue contains 272 pages between the soft card covers. The book measures 21cm by 30cm and tells the story of the design, development and history of this fighter. Volume 2 will complete the narrative by giving a full technical description as well as detail shots of the airframe.
This publication is logically broken up into a number of sections, these being:
The Beginning – Obviously this is where it all started with Gloster’s chief designer improving their Gauntlet in a bid to meet Specification F.7/30 which in 1930 called for a new fighter aircraft.
Entry into service – The RAF receives its first machines and they enter service on 22 February 1937 with the newly formed 72 Sqn. The trials and tribulations of this introduction are explained as well as its further deployment to other units later in the year.
The Munich Crisis – Here we see the RAF’s response to this period of unrest and how it affected the future organization of their squadrons.
Gladiators in the Middle East – The RAF thought it was a good idea to strengthen the defense of this area and the text looks at the various squadrons assigned to the task.
The Gladiator goes to war – This is one of the larger sections in the book as it has a lot of ground to cover. WWII saw the Gladiator in action in many theatres and these include Norway, North Africa, the Balkans, East Africa, Persia and Iran. Other sub-sections talk about the aircrafts involvement in the Battle of Britain, the Iraqi conflict and various second-line duties. Not forgotten is an informative summary of RAF camouflage and markings.
Sea Gladiator – The Fleet Air Arm was in need of a single-seat fighter and the Air Ministry looked to the RAF. After adding an arrestor hook, the Gladiator was trialed for carrier deck operations onboard HMS Courageous. With a few other modifications the type was accepted and No.801 became the first Fleet Air Arm squadron to operate the type. The narrative describes this introduction and takes the reader through the rest of the Sea Gladiator’s life as it sees spirited action during WWII. As per the previous chapter, the colours and markings of these machines are also covered in detail.
Foreign Service – The Gladiator was used all around the world and 73 pages are devoted to this section. It was exported to 11 countries as well as being transferred to another 4. The text covers this admirably in addition to describing the livery worn by each.
Gladiator Production – There were 747 Gladiators built at the Hucclecote factory and the author has tabled each production contract with the aircraft type and its allocated range of serial numbers.G
loster Gladiator in Commonwealth Squadron Service – With an update from Alex Crawford, Håkan Gustavsson has compiled a list that details the arrival and departure dates of aircraft serving in their various squadrons. This also includes notes on its service history as well as serial numbers and codes where known.
Gloster Gladiator claims – Amazingly, Gladiator pilots claimed to have shot down over 400 aircraft. This rises to over 600 if one includes “probables”. There were 17 pilots that achieved “ace” status in the Gladiator with another 30 having scored some of their total while using this aircraft.
Colour profiles – Sixteen lovely colour profiles are included that depict upper, lower, and both sides of the airframe. Many different nationalities are covered by the interesting array of markings and these should prove an inspiration to modellers.
Scattered throughout the book are over 200 black and white photographs. These are complimented by scale plans in 1:48 scale which take a look at the Gladiator Mk.I and Sea Gladiator. Also in this scale are selected side elevations which highlight foreign aircraft and those that were modified for specific purposes. Examples are Norwegian, Swedish, and Finnish Mk.Is as well as those fitted with tropical and meteorological equipment.

The Gloster Gladiator was the last British biplane fighter that saw limited action during the opening stages of the Second World War. Although outclassed in many areas by the newer monoplanes coming out, the Gladiator still managed to hold its own, and its pilots often sung its praises as a good plane to fly. Its solid performance made it an excellent aircraft for export, and the Gladiator found its way into the air forces of several small nations throughout Europe. The latest title in Mushroom Model Publications' White Series is the first of two volumes and covers the development and operational history of this famous biplane. The second volume will cover the technical specifications and notes on surviving examples (and will probably include a thorough photo walkaround). Combined these will likely be the most detailed history of the Gladiator available.
Although titled as covering the development of the Gladiator, this is actually remarkably brief. There is not much development history to tell with regards to the Gladiator, as it is simply the pinnacle of a design that had been evolving for the previous twenty years. As such, the development is nicely summed up in just a few pages. This leaves the rest of the book devoted to the operational history, of which the Gladiator had quite an extensive one. This is even more impressive when the reader notices that the operational record includes all of the foreign nations that flew the Gladiator.
The Gladiator is a British aircraft, though, so the operational record begins with the RAF and the Munich Crisis & operations in the Middle East. Following this is the wartime record, with chapters covering the Phoney War, Norway, the Blitzkrieg and the Battle of Britain, North Africa, the Balkans, East Africa, Iraq, and Persia/Iran. The Sea Gladiator is also covered, including a detailed chapter on Malta and the defense of Crete. Moving to the foreign coverage, this includes Belgium, China, Egypt, Eire, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Iraq, Latvia, Lithuania, Norway, Portugal, Russia, and Sweden.
Complementing the text are many photos, which is a boon for those interested in small air forces, as those sections are well illustrated. Speaking of illustrations, there are quite a few of those as well, again documenting all of the operators of the Gladiator. The second volume is destined to have even more illustrations, so color and marking aficionados will be quite happy.
This is a great new title from Mushroom Model Publications, and one which Gladiator fans will be glad to have.

Outstanding new Gladiator book
The Gloster Gladiator has been Alex Crawfordʼs passion for many years and his book on Henry Follandʼs famous fighter published in 2002 became a sought-after classic. A reprint seemed likely.But Alexʼs researches have continued, more information and photographs have come to light and Gladiator restoration projects have made great progress in the last seven years. Publisher Roger Wallsgrove, himself a Gladiator enthusiast, decided that Mushroom Model Publications should produce the most up-to-date and comprehensive Gladiator book possible and this is the result: up from 160 small-format pages to 272 pages in A4 format - and thatʼs just Volume 1, now published, with Volume 2 to follow. Alex has even found a pre-WW2 colour photograph for the cover, a fine air-to-air shot of the all-silver second production Gladiator K6131. Pre-war development and service, including the Munich Crisis and Middle East Gladiators, are covered fairly briefly in 13 pages but itʼs the typeʼs wartime service where Alex really gets into his stride with chapters on the Phoney War, Norway, the Blitz and the Battle of Britain, North Africa (including the Australian contribution), the Balkans, East Africa, the Iraqi revolt and Persia/Iran.
No Faith, Hope and Charity
He rounds off his section on RAF Gladiators with chapters on secondline duties and camouflage and markings before moving on to the Sea Gladiator. Gladiator operations over Malta are covered in great detail without any reference to the propaganda myth of Faith, Hope and Charity: “Four aircraft, N5519, N5520, N5522 and N5531, were assembled and test flown... The six pilots were split into two flights... In May two further Sea Gladiators, N5524 and N5529, were also made available. Other crated aircraft would be used as a source of spares.” Alex then turns to the Gladiatorʼs extensive service with foreign air forces: Belgium, China, Egypt, Eire, Finland, the Free French, Greece, Iraq, Latvia, Lithuania, Norway, Portugal and Sweden, as well as captured Gladiators serving with the Luftwaffe and the Russians. All this is illustrated with numerous black and white photographs, many of which have not been published before. Itʼs a truly impressive collection of images, accompanied by 1/48 scale line drawings and 16 pages of colour artwork. Not content with narrative and pictures, there are no less than 58 pages of tables. They start with Gladiator production and move on to individual aircraft listings for Commonwealth squadrons, RAF and Fleet Air Arm Fighter Flights, Station Flights, Meteorological Flights, Operational Training Units, Flying Training Schools and other miscellaneous units. Eight pages of combat claims and a page on Gladiator aces follow. “During its combat career,” Alex writes, “Gladiator pilots claimed over 400 aircraft shot down. Add to this the number claimed as probably destroyed and damaged then this brings the number up to at least 600 claims. (...) A total of 17 pilots achieved ace status while flying the Gladiator, and claimed 34 % of the total victories.
This is quite amazing considering the Gladiator was technically obsolete when it entered service.”

For the last eight years, Rudi Tuinman and Pascal Koeleman have been designing an imposing special show at Christmasworld, the world’s leading trade fair for festive and seasonal decorations. The aim is to encourage the trade to try something new – either in terms of window dressing and shop layout or large-scale and outdoor decorations. “The more there is to see and the greater the surprise, the higher the sales – and this applies to both smaller and bigger sales areas”, says Pascal Koeleman, CEO of 2Dezign. Following special shows entitled Merry Marriage, Happy, Window Wonderland, Newstalgia, The Ice Hotel, Design by Modern Nature and Surprise Surprise, the designers are now planning a scenario that is extremely high in contrast at the same time as being reduced. ‘The Loft’ is a modern, urban Christmas scenario with a touch of international glamour. Elegant black and cool white form the setting for the most ceremonial of all colours: red.
At the special show – in the Via Mobile between Halls 9 and 11 from 26 to 30 January 2018 – visitors can expect a completely new combination of fresh flowers and plants with the best of seasonal and festive decorations. “With the new location in the Via Mobile, we offer the trade fresh impulses for eye-catching sales areas with lots of glass and a pre-determined route”, says Koeleman.
All materials and products used are labelled with the name and stand number of the exhibitor concerned – including the fresh flowers, which can be ordered at Floradecora. “This special show is not only the perfect link to our market place for fresh flowers and ornamental plants. The idea for Floradecora was derived from this special show”, adds Eva Olbrich, Director of Christmasworld and Floradecora, Messe Frankfurt Exhibition GmbH.
Questions and answers by Rudi Tuinman, CEO, 2Dezign:
Where do you get your ideas?
We give our creativity free rein and consciously try to leave the beaten track. ‘Thinking out of the box’ is our approach. Every year we try to design a show that is completely new and different from the year before. Thus, from copper / green in ‘Design by Modern Nature’ in 2016, we moved to pastel colours with ‘Surprise Surprise’ in 2017. We orientate ourselves towards the latest trends, but ours is not a trend show. Generally speaking, we observe the exhibitors at Christmasworld and the collections they are preparing and showing. We always choose a colour palette first, and then decide on the theme we would like to illustrate. This year we decided to create a more purist, more contemporary look, still a little over the top, but with greater simplicity and cleaner lines. Our focus for 2018 is to design a big loft, like something you might find in Manhattan, with lots of white, black and silver – and a large splash of red, the ultimate Christmas colour.
Why have you opted for traditional Christmas red in ‘The LOFT’?
Primarily because it is the ultimate Christmas colour and generates warmth. And a lot of people – the buyers – purchase red. We want to show it in a modern version instead of a traditional one.
How can retailers implement your ideas?
You can do a lot with a small budget, too. Particularly important is that ‘We sell emotions not products!’ And, especially at Christmas, it’s all about emotion. Buyers, retailers and consumers need to feel the Christmas experience. For a shop / retail outlet, I would advise people to purchase a lot of the same article. So, for example, if your theme is Nature, then buy 50 birch trees 4 metres high and decorate them with Christmas lights. Make your store / department darker. Create a great twinkling effect with Christmas lights. Use one kind of decoration and show it everywhere. Have music playing, not traditional Christmas songs, but something that goes with your theme (for example, for a forest scenario, use birds & lounge music). It makes sense to use fragrances, sounds and tactile impressions. Use a lot of natural materials to make the scale bigger, for example, include lots of Christmas trees. Try to make your display an unforgettable experience for your customers. Then, they will buy a piece of this experience to take home – and they will come back.
Why are you building on a combination of fresh flowers and seasonal decoration?
We completely believe in this combination. Fresh flowers and seasonal decorations simply belong together; they enrich each other and generate emotions. After all, a flowerpot needs a plant and a glass vase needs flowers. All the materials at Christmasworld are ‘hardware’. They are brought to life by the fresh plants and flowers at Floradecora. So, we are creating added value by using fresh plants and flowers together with traditional decorations. When you display items in combinations, retailers at all levels will sell more and overall sales will rise. Of course, this only works if you have chosen the right concept, the right look and feel; this is always the starting point.
What turns shopping into an experience for you?
Once again, the key is emotion: as consumers, we see so many products that we do not actually need. Emotional sales and presentation concepts are needed to prompt us to buy some of these things. We want to make people smile and make them hungry to buy when they see a great product display. I love a good presentation that involves all the senses: music to hear, fragrances to smell, tactile sensations for the hands, beauty for the eyes and something for the palate. Plus a unique and balanced palette of colours and products. All are key elements for success.
2Dezign: Rudi Tuinman and Pascal Koeleman
The heart of 2Dezign is Rudi Tuinman and Pascal Koeleman, two Dutch designers who have made a name for themselves with interior decoration, floral design and advertising campaigns. They like to play with reality, observing things with a creative eye. The preference of 2Dezign for great effects and fresh greenery stems from the two designers’ backgrounds: Pascal Koeleman began his career as a florist and product designer, Rudi Tuinman is from the fashion and styling business. In 2000, they teamed up to found their own studio in Rijnsburg near The Hague and, since then, have chalked up international successes, especially in the field of showroom, trade-fair and commercial interior design. Today, 2Dezign consists of the two founders, a permanent team of designers and a network of creative freelancers.: | |And that’s a wrap, folks!

my review of Phish Night Three for the WestwordLocation: Hull
The Project: Hull Kingston Rovers Community Trust began in March 2008 and has a long-term vision to inspire people through sport and physical activity. We do this using the power of the Hull KR brand to work with a range of partners to deliver enjoyable, inspirational initiatives which make positive changes within our communities.
We first learnt about Efficiency North in 2016 through an e – newsletter which had information about their EN:Able Community Investment Fund. There was an information event at a local community centre and our Trust Manager attended to find out more. From this we submitted a bid to the fund. At the event it was mentioned that Efficiency North also supported local back to work schemes. The Trust was delivering a scheme called Learn with the Robins so the Trust Manager began to have conversations with Paul and Caroline about this.
We were successful with our bid to the EN:Able Community Investment Fund and we were awarded £4800 to deliver a dance project to clients from Case Training, a local organisation who worked with young people and adults with learning difficulties.
Case clients participated in weekly dance sessions which took place at the stadium. We used some of the funding to subsidise their transport costs.
12 months on and the participants have learned a full dance routine and performed in front of small and big audiences. One of them was the lead in Case’s Christmas pantomime. The staff tell us that they are always practicing their dance and have become fitter because of it. They have had lots of fun and become firm friends. The Dance Coach has also learned Makaton to be able to communicate more effectively with them. They can now all touch their toes (something none of them could do at the first session) and they love to come to their dance lessons.
As a result of this, in 2018 the Trust submitted a bid to The National Lottery’s Awards for All fund and has been awarded £10,000 to continue the work with Case and expand it into local special schools.
Alongside this, the relationship between the Trust and Efficiency North developed further. EN agreed to fund our Learn with the Robins scheme. This meant we could continue to provide meaningful back to work support to local people. A service level agreement was put in place for 12 months from April 2016. Due to this we could support over 100 people with a range of issues which were stopping them from finding a job. We achieved our target of 15 people obtaining sustainable, long term employment.Using Figure 7-3, identify how your software is deployed and the key forces behind this choice.

Part 1: Introduction
Summary: In this video, Ryan gives an overview of what will be covered in our multi-part series on high speed filmmaking, as well as defines high speed video and how it is used.
Length: 3:04 minutes
Introduction
High speed video is sexy right? I mean, you slow down your average action shot and now you have something with style and grace and a lot more production value. But shooting high speed video isn’t quite as straightforward as you might think. So we teamed up with Via Films in order to bring you this series on shooting high-speed video so that you can walk away with footage you can actually use.
What Is High Speed?
So what is high speed video? Technically high speed video is video recorded at high frame rates for playback at a slower frame rate, which results in slow motion. In the industry we call this “overcranking.” For example, action recorded at 48 frames per second and played back at 24 frames per second will be half the speed as what we normally see.
The term “overcranking” comes from the very early days when film cameras used to be cranked by hand. Cranking the camera at a higher rate fed film through the camera faster, creating more frames per second.
The faster the recorded frame rate, the slower the playback can look. While there are a lot of VERY fancy computer programs and plugins that can take standard frame rates and give the look of slow motion, the results typically do not look as smooth as capturing it at high speed in camera.
In this series we are going to take a detailed look at shooting high speed video. We will cover the basics of choosing appropriate frame rates for different subjects and actions, what triggering methods are best with each kind of events, common workflows, and the special considerations to be aware of when it comes to lighting. We’ll top it off by comparing the results of different high speed cameras shooting at various frame rates.
High speed video, or slow motion, can be a very effective tool to use in your storytelling tool belt. You can subtly add weight to a shot by recording it at 30 frames per second and playing it back at 24 frames per second, or you can go extreme and record at 1,000 frames per second. But regardless of your choice of frame rate, slow motion is most effective when it is used to add emphasis to an action. For example, pouring water on tomatoes doesn’t look as lush and inviting at regular speed as it does when it is recorded at high speed. Water gently cascading over tomatoes adds grace to the action, more than the reality of a cup of water being dumped on it. This added styling is a helpful tool to use if you are marketing your fresh produce.
Final Thoughts
So before you go out and shoot something in slow motion just because you can, ask yourself how it’s contributing to the story you are telling. If it’s not adding to it, then it is taking away from it. And that’s never a good thing.
So what do you like most about slow-motion video? Or what are some of your favorite shots from a feature film or commercial that you’ve seen? Or where have you ever seen slow motion video applied_5<<
.HEALTH AND WELLNESS
We Take Care of Each Other
Even before the pandemic, 1 in 5 adults struggled with mental health issues—and that number is only rising, especially for front line workers in the restaurant industry. In a survey by the group Chefs with Issues in partnership with Heirloom Foundation, 73 percent of chefs reported that they suffer from multiple mental health issues, including depression, anxiety and substance abuse.
That's why ROAR is doubling down on its efforts to provide free (or deeply discounted) health and wellness programs to restaurant workers. ROAR is pleased to announce that starting today industry workers have access to a new suite of services as part of ROAR’s ongoing efforts to create a holistic platform that supports the people who make our industry and our city so magnificent.
These free and deeply discounted resources include the Coa 8-Week Emotional Fitness Series, One-on-One Financial Literacy Training from the Financial Gym, Meditation from Calm, and a dashboard of health and wellness programs from Oyster Sunday, and were secured with the support of industry partners including Resy/American Express.
COA Emotional Fitness Class
ROAR x COA: Mental Health Care
To proactively offer mental health resources to restaurant workers on a large and meaningful scale, ROAR has partnered with Coa to offer 300 restaurant workers the COA 8-week emotional fitness series at a deep discount of $15/class. In these live classes, you'll learn: How to build a foundation for mental health through the seven traits of emotional fitness; Concrete tools, best practices, and strategies to kickstart a healthy emotional fitness regimen; and How to encourage emotional fitness in your relationships at work and at home.
One-on-One Financial Coaching
ROAR x Financial Gym: Financial Literacy
ROAR’s partnership with the Financial Gym will help give 1000 restaurant workers three free months of unlimited personal finance coaching. Financial Gym’s one-on-one (virtual) coaches are trained to help with budgeting, understanding student loans, questions about managing credit cards, and how to develop a healthy mindset around your money.President Trump proclaimed to Axois that he plans to use an Executive Order to do away with birthright citizenship and while that may not actually happen because it’s unconstitutional and would likely result in lengthy legal battles going all the way to the Supreme Court.
Surprisingly, after announcing his intentions, Planned Parenthood took to defending babies. Babies born to people here illegally, that is.
Hmmm. Seems odd that an organization who profits off of terminating pregnancies would suddenly care so much about the unborn! This fact did not go unnoticed on Twitter.

— BonkPolitics (@BonkPolitics) October 30, 2018We are likely months away from an official release of the Samsung Galaxy S9 however we are already starting to see leaks and rumors of the device. An alleged CAD for the S9 has already leaked. Some case and accessory makes use factory CADs to put together their product well ahead of release. The CAD in question shows a vertical dual lens camera setup with fingerprint scanner underneath. Samsung seems to be all in on placing the fingerprint scanner beside the camera instead of under it. Could they be changing things up now that the iPhone X has been released with a vertical camera setup? It doesn't seem likely. I personally don't like the way this looks and like the current configuration when it comes to aesthetics. There is no denying the fingerprint scanner would be easier to find in this setup. That being said if this CAD is to be believed then it would also mean we won't be seeing a scanner embedded in the Galaxy S9 display which would be unfortunate. You can also see what appears to be a Bixby button beneath the volume rocker which is to be expected. Even if this were real Samsung might go through dozens of design changes between now and the Galaxy S9 release. Either way these things are interesting to see. Would you prefer this setup over the camera, and fingerprint scanner setup of the Note 8? via SlashleaksAccess to Fair Assessment Policy
Introduction
This policy covers the arrangements for fair assessment for students taking any course at Born to be Beautiful. Students are made aware of the existence of this policy and have open access to it on paper in a folder in the Born to be Beautiful Centre and on the Born to be Beautiful website at:
All tutors teaching at Born to be Beautiful are made aware of the contents and purpose of this policy. This policy is reviewed annually and may be revised in response to feedback from students, tutors and organisations.
Policy Statement
Every student taking a course with Born to be Beautiful Centres will be assessed fairly.
That means that:
- Assessment will be a test of what the student knows, what they understand and what they are able to do.
- For any particular course, every student will be assessed using the same overall set of exercises and criteria.
- Assessments will be standardised across different tutors and classes to ensure that all students have to be judged against the same standards.
Procedure for Appeals by Students
If a student feels that they have not been assessed fairly then they should use the Appeals & Complaints Procedure to appeal the assessment decision of their tutor. However, the first step is always to discuss the situation with the tutor concerned.
Accident and Emergency Procedures
Ensure that the emergency services have been called.
Attend the scene and determine continuing danger
If safe to do so;
Assess the nature and extent of the injury
Administer first aid
Accompany the injured until the Emergency Services arrive
Ensure the accident is recorded.
If necessary arrange for transfer of the injured to sites of continuing care ( e.g. hospital outpatients, at home with relatives, etc)
If appropriate during attendance

Take photographs (still and or video)
Collect evidence. Inform next of kin.
Anti Bribery and Corruption Policy
Statement of Principle
We adopt a zero-tolerance approach to bribery and corruption and are committed to acting professionally, fairly and with integrity in all our global operations. We are committed to implementing and enforcing effective systems to counter bribery.
There are real risks for the charity if it is associated with bribery. The potential damage to reputation may be severe and could result in the loss of confidence and support from donors and the wider public. The UK Bribery Act 2010 also outlines penalties, including imprisonment and unlimited fines, for any breach of its provisions.
Bribery, as defined by the Charity Commission (Compliance Toolkit: Fraud & Financial Crime, June 2012), means offering, promising or giving someone a financial or other advantage to encourage them to perform their functions or activities improperly and includes where it is known or believed that the acceptance of the advantage in itself constitutes improper performance. It also means asking for or agreeing to accept a bribe.
The Bribery Act creates four criminal offences
Bribing another person
Accepting a bribe
Bribing a foreign official
Failing to prevent bribery (For a commercial organisation)
Bribery is more deeply embedded in some areas of the world, and it is important that we recognise the greater risk in these areas and do not lower our standards to conform to prevailing custom or local standards. We will refer to studies, such as Transparency International’s Corruption Perception Index, to assess the likely risk in the different countries in which we operate. Denmark with a score of 90 ranks as the least corrupt and Somalia, North Korea and Afghanistan with a score of 8 ranks as the most corrupt in 2012. Uganda ranked 130 with a score of 29 and India ranked 94 with a score of 36, indicating a serious corruption problem.
Facilitation payments, for example, to government employees to speed up a service, are bribes and as such is unacceptable and illegal. These payments should be resisted unless there are exceptional circumstances in which personal security and duress mean individuals are left with no alternative but to make payment. Clear documentation will be required for any payments made.
The Ministry of Justice sets out six principles to inform an organisation’s anti-bribery policies which we will apply.
Proportionate Procedures:
An organisation’s procedures to prevent bribery by persons associated with it are proportionate to the bribery risk it faces and to the nature, scale and complexity of its activities.
Top Level Commitment :
The trustees and senior managers are committed to preventing bribery and foster a culture in which bribery is never acceptable
Risk Assessment:
The organisation assesses the nature and extent of the risks of bribery on its behalf by persons associated with it. The assessment is periodic, informed and documented.
Due Diligence:
The organisation applies due diligence, taking a proportionate and risk-based approach, in respect of persons who perform services for or on behalf of the organisation to mitigate identified bribery risks.
Communication:
Bribery prevention policies are embedded and understood throughout the organisation through internal and external communication.
Monitoring and Review:
The organisation monitors and reviews procedures designed to prevent bribery and makes improvements where necessary.
Our board of trustees has overall responsibility for ensuring this policy complies with our legal and ethical obligations; is appropriate for the risks we face; and that all those under our control comply with it. The trustees will regularly monitor the effectiveness and review the implementation of this policy, regularly considering its suitability, adequacy and effectiveness.
This policy applies to everyone associated with Born to be Beautiful whether as employees, trustees, interns, or otherwise, and includes all agents, partners or other third party acting or performing services on our behalf.
Partners & Third Parties
Where we operate with a partner we will ensure that organisation’s aims and values are compatible with the charity. In particular, we will perform reasonable due diligence and reference checks on new partners; we will conduct a review proportionate to the circumstances of the manner in which a partner intends to act with us or on our behalf and to the country in which the business partner is located or does business; and we will confirm their understanding of applicable anti-bribery and corruption legislation. We will communicate our zero-tolerance approach to bribery and corruption to all third parties acting or performing services on our behalf at the outset of the relationship, and as appropriate thereafter.
Employees
Employees and trustees of the charity are personally responsible for compliance with this policy. The responsibility includes the prevention, detection and reporting of bribery and other forms of corruption. They must also avoid any activity that might lead to, or suggest, a breach of this policy.
Born to be Beautiful will provide appropriate education and training on the policy. We will confirm on an annual basis that all individuals covered by the policy are aware of the latest version of this document and, where appropriate, obtain explicit confirmation from such individuals that they acknowledge and understand the responsibilities it places on them.
The charity aims to encourage openness and will support anyone who raises concerns in good faith under this policy, even if the concerns turn out to be mistaken.

Cultural Awareness Policy for Uganda
Culture is people’s ‘way of life’, meaning the way they do things.
It is the collective programming of the mind that distinguishes the members or a group of people from others.
It consists of the unwritten rules of the social game.
Cultural Awareness
An essential skill in the provision of culturally appropriate services, cultural awareness entails an understanding of how a person’s culture may inform their values, behaviour, beliefs and basic assumptions.
Cultural awareness recognises that we are all shaped by our cultural background, which influences how we interpret the world around us, perceive ourselves and relate to other people.
Uganda is a country made up of a diverse range of ethnic groups.
There are over 30 different African languages (referred to as the vernacular – the language or native dialect of a specific population)
Official languages are English and Swahili.
Most Ugandans, including children speak, write and understand English.
Social customs vary according to race, tribe and religion.
British social habits are acceptable everywhere.
People are generally friendly.
The usual modes of address are as used in the UK.
Arriving in Uganda for the first time
A foreigner may experience some culture shock’. Although Ugandans speak English, it has a distinct local flavour. Ugandan English is influenced by accent, manipulating some words for euphonic purpose and peculiar cultural meaning and sometimes having had very little contact with native British speakers. e.g. I will eat your money ( spend it recklessly), She is putting on nice! (She is dressed well). It is not considered polite for the visitor to laugh out loud at perceived mispronunciations or broken English of their hosts. It is their version of English, and if they break it and made it work for their part of the world it’s more tactful to let it be. Ugandans tend to resent being lectured to or condescended to by foreigners. Mimicking accents as a form of teasing or trying to fit in is not encouraged – they are a polite people, they never admit to deep dislike, but Ugandans are fiercely proud and do not respond well to perceived mockery. When meeting people for the first time (home and corporate) a firm polite handshake for either gender is adequate. In some ethnic groups, women may drop a slight curtsey as well which is a culture norm and should be taken as such. Elders are venerated in Uganda – they are to be addressed in the honorific at all times (home and business) – unless they ask you not to. In Uganda, some ethnic groups avoid direct eye contact with a person upon first meeting (it is a sign of disrespect or challenge in their culture to do so). As the relationship thaws, eye contact is established and maintained. Guests should not take it as a sign of weakness or dishonesty.
Business
In business, Ugandans value forthrightness and honesty. They are shrewd businessmen and can competently negotiate and deal at the same level as the Western. Decisions are often made by a group within the company where there is a premium on consensus. Many Ugandans like to discuss business extensively, and usually seek external advice, before making decisions.. They are however very proud people and sensitive to anyone implying their culture is backward (Western competitiveness may be seen as showing off), for a deal to be completed amicably refrain from odious comparisons.
In Homes
In homes children will kneel and clap rhythmically when greeting a visitor- a cultural form of respect to be accepted as such. Children at times also kneel and clap when receiving gifts – a sign of appreciation in their culture. Children in homes usually play in their own areas and at mealtimes, eat quietly, speaking only when addressed. Ugandan society is close-knit and has extended family. Terms like cousin sister and cousin brother refer to first and second cousins usually. It is normal for children adolescents and teens to do most of the household chores. It is an accepted cultural norm. They are training for married life to run their own homes. Laziness, talking back and boldness are discouraged. Spanking is not a crime in Uganda, and all elders are allowed to swiftly discipline naughtiness. As a foreigner though, it is not wise to hit your host’s children or criticise them unless they have been extremely terrible. Copying the Ugandan curtsey, clapping when receiving gifts usually is rewarded by indulgent smiles. No one will be offended if you keep your Western culture.
Traditions
In traditional rites and rituals, should you be fortunate enough to attend, ask permission before taking pictures or joining their dances. Africans are deeply religious and undue interference e.g. in a rain dance may offend them greatly. In Uganda, people are friendly but because of bad press from some Western media they are wary of indiscriminating picture taking. Please ask permission first. Taking pictures of uniformed forces without their permission is never a good idea. Discretion and Modesty
Public displays of affection in Uganda are not common. They believe in discretion and modesty as true virtue of maturity. Kissing, petting and fondling your spouse in public may be tolerated as foreign strange culture and it makes everyone very uncomfortable. Please do not engage in this behaviour in front of children of your hosts, they would be justified in asking you to leave. Sexual behaviour is a very private matter in Uganda- you may use your designated bedroom to be affectionate.
Family
When invited for a meal, one is not expected to bring a bottle or contribute to food. If one wishes you may bring the hosts children small gifts or something for the whole family e.g. sweets for the children, a box of ice-cream for everyone to enjoy. It is polite to complement the chef (usually your hostess) after the meal. If you are a single male, please do not bring a gift for your married hostesses only; avoid kissing or hugging her unless you are sure her husband is fine with it. For your hosts- giving their children presents and buying a few groceries is acceptable. Giving or offering cash may hurt pride of people who genuinely felt happy to host you. Perhaps if there is serious need you may leave an envelope when you leave. As an icebreaker, bringing along pictures of your family, where you live etc will help greatly. Even in a business setup, a little background information puts everyone at ease.
Dress
It is not polite to appear in polite society in a shabby ensemble. Torn, dirty, un-ironed clothes are disrespectful. For women, inappropriately short clothes, sleeveless clothes are informal and best avoided in formal company.
Tipping
Tipping service providers like waiters are very generous. 10 % of the bill is allowed. You may use foreign currency – (not coins) which is redeemable at banks.

Financial Controls Policy
“Internal financial controls are essential checks and procedures that help charity trustees: meet their legal duties to safeguard the charity’s assets; administer the charity’s finances and assets in a way that identifies and manage.” Charity Commission – Internal financial controls for charities 2011
Financial Controls
A key feature of internal financial controls is to ensure that no single individual will have sole responsibility for any single transaction from authorisation to completion and review. As a general rule any financial transaction will be approved by at least two people, one of which is a trustee.
These will include:
Writing cheques from the charity bank account
Withdrawing cash from the charity bank account
Using a credit or debit card on the charity’s account
Setting up direct debits or standing orders on the charity’s behalf
Using electronic banking facilities
Transactions will be promptly recorded in the accounts. Access to the charity bank account is limited to named persons and all records, cards, cheque books, pins and passwords are kept secure.
Expenditure will be approved by at least one trustee. Orders placed should be within an agreed budget and invoices will be checked confirming the price paid and the receipt of the goods or services ordered. Cash transactions will be kept to a minimum. A cash float can be used for very small expenditures and its use recorded in a petty cash book.
Income in the post will be recorded and banked immediately. Ideally post will opened in the presence of an unrelated person. Collection boxes are numbered sealed, regularly opened and a record of their location and takings made. Cash received is banked as soon as possible without deduction of expenses. Fundraising events will be conducted in accordance with the relevant legislative framework, as outlined in The Charity Commission’s guidance Charities and Fundraising (CC20)
The current scale of the charity means an external auditor is unnecessary, but instead financial activities will be regularly reported and monitored by the trustees. The effectiveness of the charity’s internal financial controls will be reviewed at least annually. This will include an assessment of whether the controls are relevant to, and appropriate for, the charity and not too onerous or disproportionate.
Expenses
Expense claims will be authorised by someone other than the claimant and checked for accuracy before payment. Expense claims should contain a self-declaration that the claim is accurate and incurred in connection with the business of the charity. Reimbursement will be made by cheque.
Restricted Donations
The charity does receive restricted donations which can be spent at the discretion of the trustees in furtherance of some particular aspect of the objects of the charity. Restricted funds are recorded in the accounts and a record kept of how they are spent. Donations may be refused where conditions attached are unduly restrictive or are intended to exercise undue influence over the trustees or where the acceptance of the donation would be detrimental to the charity’s reputation.
Financial Reporting
The charity needs access to accurate and up-to-date financial information to make proper decisions. This can include the latest internal accounts or bank statements. At the beginning of each year a budget will be prepared outlining planned income and expenditure for the period. The trustees will review this regularly and the reasons for any changes explained.
We are also legally required to produce annual accounts for the Charity Commission. These will be based on internal records of income and expenditure and will be reconciled against the bank statements and copies of invoices or receipts. Someone other than the person who made the accounting entries will undertake reconciliation.
We keep a list of the charity’s fixed assets which will be regularly updated.
The assets will also be checked to ensure they are in good repair and of use to the charity.
The Trustees’ meetings will be used to communicate information concerning the finances and approve the accounts. All decisions by the trustees will normally be taken collectively and significant decisions and action points noted in writing.
Gift Aid
Wherever possible donations will be used for Gift Aid. Secure records will be kept of amounts reclaimed and the donor’s authorisation and personal details as required by HMRC
Tainted Donations
We have a legal requirement to identify tainted donations. These occur when a donor gets relief from tax only for the capital or a benefit from the donation to end up back in the hands of the donor..
Financial Crime
The incidence of reported financial crime affecting charities is relatively small. However, when it does happen the impact can be great. Financial crimes such as fraud, theft, and money laundering, or the loss of electronic data can result not only in significant loss of charitable funds but also in damage to the public trust and confidence in charities more generally. ‘phishing’)
Gift aid fraud
Share purchase and investment fraud (boiler room fraud)
Mass Market fraud (letter or e-mail)
Section ‘419’ (payment in advance for promises of wealth) frauds
Trustees, employees and volunteers will all need to consider the risk of financial crime and report any suspicions. If trustees know or suspect an individual is misusing the charity for their own purposes or misappropriating charitable funds they should take immediate and appropriate action to resolve the issue.
If it is known or suspected that a charity is a victim of financial crime then this should always be reported to the police and as a matter of best practice to the Charity Commission immediately under the Serious Incident Reporting regime.
Data Protection
Through our fundraising and charitable work we have access to personal data including addresses. This data is very valuable and its loss could expose the charity and others to the risk of theft, fraud, identity theft and loss. Data is stored in locked filing cabinets or electronically. The charity PC is password protected and access to that password is limited. We use antivirus firewall and spyware software. We do not share data with third parties without permission.
We have a separate policy on bribery and a separate policy on reserves and investments.
Good Practice Checklist for Teaching and Volunteer Staff
Disclosure & Confidentiality
- Students should be encouraged to disclose a disability at the start of and during their course.
- Know how to respond if a student discloses to you and to whom with the student’s consent, their information should be passed.
- Make your teaching more accessible to the full range of disabled learners – for example, facing the front while speaking, providing hand-outs in advance, taping sessions etc.
- Teaching materials can be made available in different formats such as large print or different coloured paper.
- Identify if a student requires extra support such as an interpreter, extra tuition, personal or counselling support or learning support.
- Make adjustments in practical sessions so disabled students have access.
- While academic standards must not be compromised, some disabled students require reasonable adjustments to assessments and examinations if they are to have equal access.
- Students will be given the opportunity to discuss any adaptations to assignments and examinations well in advance of the assessment date. These might include extra time, the opportunity to take rest breaks, examination questions in a different format.

Health and Safety Policy Uganda
In Uganda there is a saying, “Health is Wealth.”
It is a good idea for anyone travelling to a foreign country to take necessary precautions to avoid the trauma and inconvenience of falling ill whilst in a foreign country.
Uganda is a large country with a lot of remote areas and a population of about 33 million. Although they have the best research institute in the world for treatment of haemorrhagic diseases like Ebola as well as other dangerous tropical diseases, the country was still ranked at 186 out of 191 in the health sector by the World Health Organisation (WHO) in 2012. The Ugandan government and donor community would be highly commended if they would increase their health budget in the country. Ironically, Uganda has a fully functional private hospital sector where medication is readily available, treatment is immediate and one can be referred out of the country if very ill. Consultation and treatment may cost up to USD$20. (An astronomic amount to the man on the street)
In Uganda, the main serious diseases are Malaria, Diarrheal diseases, HIV, and traffic accident casualties. Common health problems like headaches, colds, skin irritations, diarrhoea, and alcohol abuse may seem worse to the visitor than they really are because of environment changes. To allay these, in addition to using basic common sense, one should pack a simple medical kit when travelling. Ugandans dress conservatively for formal occasions and therefore it is a good idea to follow their example. It also helps to avoid insect bites especially mosquitoes causing malaria. They bite any time but especially at night, the best prevention is sleeping under a treated net and using insect repellent.
Most diarrheal diseases can be avoided by washing hands and fruit thoroughly and only drinking clean water. In some tribes in Uganda, water is extremely sacred. They will not conduct business or be comfortable with a guest without offering water to drink- it is polite to drink to show acceptance. (If you are suspicious of the source, smile politely and explain you are still adjusting to the climate and ask for boiling water instead). It is impolite to bring your own water to the table- both corporate and at home. If you are living with a family and you do not trust the water source, tactfully ask the hostess in private if you might purify the drinking water for everyone because your stomach has failed to adapt to the local water (do not let or ask her to pay for it- give her the pills or do it as she watches). A better idea is to buy a family size bottle to use as a family. In a corporate set up you are usually issued bottled water, which is safe to drink.
Uganda has a wide range of local homemade alcohol. If you are planning to taste or attempt to drink it, please exercise due caution as a small amount is usually quite potent – especially to the foreign palate. In some cases the ingredients have caused serious health problems- whether in allergic reaction or simple alcohol poisoning. Imported alcohol and local Standard Approved brands are available and serve the same purpose.
Ugandans will not be offended if you fail to eat their native dishes, indeed they will happily offer you an alternative European one. It is advisable to let your host family know any allergies or disease you may have so they adjust the menu appropriately.
In Uganda, like in any part of the world, traffic accidents are common and can be horrific. Keep your medical aid accessible so as to receive treatment quickly. Air evacuation is available when necessary. HIV is a real threat, if indulging in sexual activity with a stranger, native or fellow countrymen please use protection.
Rabies is also prevalent in Uganda and tourists are often the worst casualties. Please do not pet strange animals (especially stray cats, dogs you may be feeling sorry for) tease them or unnecessarily snap your camera. ALL animals can bite, and wandering deliberately into their territory to snap pictures or try to befriend them will usually end in tears- yours.
Uganda is safer for tourists than many other African countries, but the risks of foot travel during dawn and twilight must be emphasized. Boda boda’s are a very unsafe way to travel. Avoid the Kololo airstrip area — especially at dusk/after dark. Avoid the Yusuf Lule road that runs along the golf course by foot or boda boda at dusk/after dark.
Wearing Jewellery is also discouraged as it can put a barrier between you and the locals and make you into a target for thieves.
Money
Credit cards are not widely used and there have been reported incidents of credit card fraud, even in international hotels. Carry travellers’ cheques or cash in US dollars. Travellers’ cheques can only be cashed in major towns, often at a much lower rate of exchange. US dollars dated earlier than 2001 and notes smaller than US$50 are usually exchanged at a less favourable rate and in some cases not accepted at all.
Visas
British nationals need a visa to enter Uganda. You can get a visa from the Ugandan High Commission in London, or at Entebbe airport on arrival. For further information about entry requirements, visit the Ugandan Ministry of Internal Affairs website or email them atinfo@mia.gov.ug. If you’re arriving by road, it’s usually easier to get a visa before you travel.
Passport validity
Your passport should be valid for a minimum period of 6 months from the date of entry into Uganda.

Planning Your Vaccination Schedule
Some vaccinations, like that for rabies and Yellow Fever. There are costs involved for some.
The health situation in most African countries requires visitors to be up to date with all common childhood vaccines. If you are travelling with children, make sure they have had all their shots. You may also need to get boosters for tetanus, diphtheria and measles if you haven’t had those in a while.
This includes
Diphtheria
Hepatitis B
Measles
Mumps
Polio
Rubella
Tetanus
Yellow Fever
The following vaccinations are also highly recommended for travel to every African country:
Hepatitis A
Meningococcal meningitis
Rabies
Typhoid

Non-harassment and bullying policy.
The charity supports the rights of all people to seek, obtain and hold employment without harassment or bullying.
It is the Born to be Beautiful policy to make every effort to provide a working and studying environment free from harassment, bullying and intimidation (whether the harassment is on the grounds of gender, gender reassignment, marital status, civil partnership status, pregnancy, maternity, paternity, part-time and/or fixed-time, status, sexual orientation, age, disability, race, colour, nationality or national or ethnic origins, religion or belief, union membership status or otherwise).

Monitoring and Evaluation
Training
All our projects will be throughly monitored and evaluated. We will use Housing indicators, characteristics, demographics, education, investments and savings assets and behavioural changes, to indicate the value and impact of our work.
Quality Assurance Policy
Born to be Beautiful is a UK registered charity which has been providing beauty therapy training and skills to victims of abject poverty and modern day slavery since 2011. We continue to do this by delivering beauty therapy courses in India and Uganda.
Quality is fundamental to Born to be Beautiful’s aim to provide inclusive, high-quality learning opportunities to the poorest of the poor internationally.
We are committed to continuous improvement and quality management systems which provide a framework for measuring and improving our performance. The following systems and procedures are in place to support this:
- A monitoring and evaluating procedure encompassing all tutors and teaching assistants participating on our beauty therapy courses.
- Training and development of all our volunteers, and actively helping each one progress into employment.
- Ensuring that all our students are supplied with uniforms and equipment and products which are of a consistent quality and quantity.
Our internal procedures are reviewed regularly. The Born to be Beautiful Management Team monitor quality levels and management systems, making suitable changes to policy as considered appropriate.
Reserves and Investment Policy
Reserves are that part of a charity’s unrestricted funds that is freely available to spend on any of the charity’s purposes.. (Charity Commission – Charities & Reserves 2010)
Given the nature of Born to be Beautiful’s work it is likely that the charity will hold reserves. Fund raising is ongoing through the year, but charitable activities, notably the teaching trips abroad, are concentrated expenditures and may not occur in the same year.
Born to be Beautiful will use reserves to:
Acquire assets to use in the charity’s work
Meet the day to day running costs of the charity
Cover any unforeseen emergency or unexpected need for funds
In setting a target level of reserves we have taken into account:
The reliability of each source of income and the prospects for developing new income sources
Forecasts for expenditure for the current and future years on the basis of planned activity
Analysis of any future needs, opportunities, commitments or risks, where future income alone is unlikely to be able to meet anticipated costs
Assessment, on the best evidence reasonably available, of the likelihood of each of those needs that justify having reserves arising and the potential consequences for the charity of not being able to meet them
Reserve levels will be monitored through the year and efforts made to spend or replenish them as appropriate.
The trustees will also ensure that the reserves policy continues to be relevant as the charity develops or changes its strategy and activities.
Reserves should not exceed £20,000
Reserves at year end 2012 were £12,000
Investment Policy
Born to be Beautiful is likely to hold surplus funds and it is appropriate to consider whether some or all of the reserves can be invested to obtain a financial return for the charity. As reserves, these funds must be available at short notice for expenditure and the preservation of capital is a primary concern.
Given the current scale of the charity it is appropriate for us to hold our surplus funds in a UK interest bearing bank account. These are currently held by Coutts. While we believe this a well regulated and solvent institution, it is prudent to consider diversification. Should the balance of the account exceed £85,000, the maximum repayable under the Financial Services Compensation Scheme, the trustees will consider an additional institution.
Should the reserves of the charity become significantly larger and the time frame for their expenditure lengthened, it may be appropriate to consider other investments such as equities or bonds. In this case it is likely we would adopt an ethical investment policy. While this may provide a lower rater of return than an alternative investment, it would ensure that our funds are invested in a way that reflects Born to be Beautiful’s values and ethos and does not run counter to its aims. In particular, areas such as human rights abuses, labour standards and the exploitation of women would be key concerns. We would expect an external manager to conduct screening to avoid companies whose activities run contrary to our values, but also to engage positively with managements to improve their corporate social responsibility and governance.
Security When Travelling
Criminals look for the easy target. Following the guidelines below will make you less likely to become a victim.
Social Media Safety
- Remain vigilant about your social media security and privacy setting. Regularly check your privacy filters to ensure your network does not reset to a less stringent standard.
- Do not post sensitive information about yourself or others.
- Disable geotagging/ GPS and location tracking features on cameras and phones. Pictures and post on social sites that identify your location give criminals the ability to track your movements and chart likely times and locations to target you.
General Security Practices
- police station.
- Avoid giving unnecessary personal details to anyone unless their identity can be verified.
- Report all suspicious persons loitering near your place of work; attempt to provide a complete description of the person and/or vehicle to police or security personnel. Consider taking a photograph of the person if it can be done discreetly.
- Advise associates or family members of your destination and anticipated time of arrival when leaving the office or residence.
- Do not open doors to strangers and report unsolicited contacts to authorities. Refuse to meet with strangers outside your work place.
- Memorize key phone numbers such as your office, home, police, security etc.
- Travel in small groups as much as possible and vary movements. Do not be predictable.
- Try to be inconspicuous when using public transportation and facilities. Dress, conduct and mannerisms should not attract attention and be generally similar to that of other people in the area.
- Avoid spontaneous gatherings or demonstrations.
- Stay away from known trouble, disreputable places or other high-risk areas. Visit reputable establishments.
- Know emergency numbers and how to use the local telephone system.
- Ensure family members have a list of phone numbers they can carry with them at all times. The list should not outline office locations but should be usable during an emergency.
- In country, get business card of hotel and any other phone numbers so they are at hand if you need them and your driver’s number.After fourteen seasons of heart-wrenching tragedies and jaw-dropping miracles, there exists a very short list of topics untouched by ABC and Shondaland’s Grey’s Anatomy. Yet, in all that time, no episode has been more timely than the mid season premiere, “1-800-799-7233," for its unsettling representation of intimate partner violence.
For those less familiar with the lives of the doctors at Grey-Sloan Memorial Hospital, we’ll spare you the drama and give you the must-know details. Loyal viewers knew to expect an unsettling meeting between Dr. Jo Wilson (Camilla Luddington) and her abusive husband Paul Stadler (Matthew Morrison) since the violent man’s curveball entrance closed out the 2017 winter finale. It is then we were reminded Paul beat Jo over the most minuscule of occurrences, bruising her face and stomach.
When the abuse finally became too much to bear, Jo, who was going by her original legal name of Brooke Stadler at the time, abandoned her entire life in Massachusetts where she’d attended medical school and met Paul, moved to Seattle, and changed her name to better hide from her spouse.
Paul once again finds himself holding power over Jo when he realizes she has not told many, if anyone at all, of their marriage. While Paul is seemingly “joking” about whether Jo, a former student of Stadler, can recall his medical school teachings, it also serves a defense if she’s ever spoken about his abuse.
Paul attempts a similar defamation of Jo when he ends up in an operating room with the series namesake, Meredith Grey (Ellen Pompeo). Meredith recognizes Paul immediately and tells him she knows of his abuse on Jo. Typical of an accused abuser, Paul blames their failed marriage on Jo: her childhood, mental health, her drinking, and deep-seated destructive nature. Thankfully, Meredith isn’t fooled by Paul, but it’s safe to assume people who didn’t know Jo have believed his lies for years as he defends himself for her estrangement.
Unfortunately, we come to find out Paul has devoured a new victim in his latest romantic partner, Jenny (Bethany Joy Lenz). With the help of Meredith, Jo creates a distraction for Paul so she can have a few minutes alone with Jenny. While Jenny initially rejects Jo’s accusations against Paul, her face changes when Jo details the day her husband kicked her so violently he broke her ribs and almost ruptured her kidney. We get to assume in this moment that Jenny has finally acknowledged the way in which her fiancé treats her is abusive.
This episode is important for the way it highlights both women’s different journey toward ending up with Paul. The huge takeaway is that anyone can find themselves in an abusive relationship. We know Jo struggled as a child in the foster care system. Without a support system, Jo worked hard putting herself through school and even living out of her car at one point. It’s easy to understand how a man could fabricate a fairy tale life to entice a young woman like Jo. It’s even more understandable how her husband manipulated and gaslighted her for so long.
Jenny, on the other hand, is well educated and seemingly has her wits about her. At the realization of what her relationship truly is, she exclaims, “I’m smart! I’m a scientist! I’m a feminist! I never thought I would end up in something like this.”
Domestic violence can take many forms. It is not exclusive to a specific population or demographic. Anyone can fall victim to violent, manipulative, and distressing relationships. This also means anyone can be helped.
The episode is titled with the phone number of the National Domestic Violence Hotline, and while the number isn’t used throughout the episode, the significance of its promotion speaks volumes. There might be someone in the Grey’s couch crowd who recognizes a piece of their own story or someone they know in Jo's battle. Perhaps it reaches someone who identifies with Jenny, and has never realized the abuse in their relationship is not their fault.
In the era of #MeToo and Time's Up and women standing up for one another, this episode is timely, effective, and maybe even necessary. If you or someone you know is in a violent or abusive relationship, you are not alone. Resources are available and ready to help you.

Summer is almost over, the insane ComEd bills from your air conditioning running non stop in the heat are starting to roll in, and so are the phone calls from scammers trying to steal even more of your hard earned money.
About this exact time last year, this particular scam was making the rounds in Rockford, and now it's rearing its ugly head again, but this time it's in Dixon...so far.
Dixon Police took to social media yesterday to warn residents about scammers calling and claiming to be with ComEd. They are calling to request immediate payment for outstanding balances, which is something ComEd doesn't do in real life, they send a letter for that.
Thank you, scammers for making me feel less like a jerk for always screening my phone and never answering numbers I don't know.
If you have to answer your phone, and you do receive one of these calls, please report it to the Illinois Attorney General here.

We’re not sure who is the original orator of that phrase, but on this day, every year, it’s sure to be repeated here in Texas.
It case you just rode into town, March 2 is Texas Independence Day, and is a legal holiday in the Lone Star State. That may not get you a day off, but it does provide tacit sanction to celebrate, or merely reflect.
March 2 marks the day in 1836 – 181 years ago – that 59 delegates held a Constitution Convention at Washington-on-the-Brazos to declare Texas’s independence from Mexico, establishing it as the Republic of Texas. The deadly battle of the Alamo was already underway, and on March 6 the delegates received a letter (dated March 3) from Col. William Barret Travis which stated: “Let the Convention go on and make a declaration of independence, and we will then understand, and the world will understand, what we are fighting for. If independence is not declared, I shall lay down my arms, and so will the men under my command.”
You can look at a timeline of Texas history, including the events that led to the Convention, here.
Guidebook from the past
There’s something about reviewing history that develops our understanding of current events, and provides guidance, and cautions, for the future. We know it from our retrospective musings – what events in our past brought us to our current stations, or shaped our passions and beliefs?
Texas forefathers shed a great deal of blood to get to where we are today, years before becoming part of the United States of America. The independent streak still runs strong through the Lone Star state.
Celebrate wherever you are!
If you’re one of the lucky ones with time on your hands today, here’s a handy guide of things to do to honor Texas and those who fought for our independence, as well as revel in all things Texas – from chicken fried steak, to learning more about Texas history from the Bob Bullock Museum. For those who enjoy traveling around the state, we also recommend reviewing the Texas Independence Trail.
And you don’t need to live in Texas to enjoy events: Texans represent Texas all around the U.S. (and the world), so just click on the links below to find out how you can celebrate the Spirit of Texas.

Hi my name is Amie. I am a Clairvoyant Medium. Have been working as a Medium professionally for 14 years. I'm not your average person that knew I had the gift as a child i stumbled upon it. When I myself went to have a reading. I was then told by the reader I could do this and that I would be good at it. My reaction was nah your crazy. She was like no.
I have experience in many issues like domestic violence, abuse, neonatal death. Pregnancy loss and love and relationships. You'll be amazed at my accuracy. I then started practicing on friends and family and they were like WOW! You should advertise so I did.
I also created a website it is and is named after my son jesse, who died shortly after birth.
I may be in a wheelchair but there is nothing I can't do. I also plan to write an autobiography one day.

Mediumship is the practice of mediating the communication of words, emotions, symbols and understanding between the spirits of both alive and past beings. Amie uses her being as an instrument to receive and convey to you messages and guidance from beyond our human realm. Through this service, you may be passed information, energy, understanding or insights from a variety of spiritual energies. Often people may bring a question to guide the process or simply trust in the higher realms to share what is appropriate for you, right now. Either way, you will find a care and quality in Amie’s approach.
Mediumship involves Amie allowing and opening her physical being as a receiver on the Earthly plane from the metaphysical plane. She will channel forth energies relevant to your experience and allow them to manifest within her, then communicate them with you for possible guidance, examination or identification. This service may be useful to you if you seek guidance, messages from loved ones passed, clearing, or clarity. Amie’s mental mediumship skills are the act of receiving information, through various aspects of thought transference, or mental telepathy then shared with you.
This process is held in a safe, private space where you can rest assured that your experience has been considered every step of the way. Amie will provide you with grounding and a debriefing after the session to make sure you are centred and ready to begin integrating your new information.

After this, she will use the information that she has available, which can include colours, images, visions, dreams and symbols, and speak with you about them. Together you will make sense of and find clarity of your relationship to your experience and environment. She will support you throughout this session.
Many people work with Amie to find clarity over things that appear during the session related to their experience, sometimes literally and sometimes metaphorically. Amie’s gentle way will take you through the process and provide you with more pieces to the puzzle of the human mind and existence. She has the ability to see beyond the usual range of ordinary perception. You may have also heard of this skill being called second visions or third eye visions, and you would be correct. This powerful sensory skill is a visionary quest for information, and it requires a welcomed vulnerability to the non-physical and openness to guidance and imagery.
Visionary images are symbolic, and together, you and Amie can illuminate the path ahead. Clairvoyance is a path to tap into the knowledge of our soul and the collective consciousness of all beings – past, present and future.

This incredible service is the connective process of inviting a spirit to inspire your thoughts. The practice is similar to a waking trance so that the needed information can be guided through the medium like a channel from the higher source. Amie practices automatic writing as an intuitive sense and can channel the precise messages for guidance in your life. Automatic writing is also known as ‘spirit writing’. This is because it works as a method of communicating with your spirit guides. The higher self can also be reached through this method and you may find that your own higher consciousness has the path of manifestation chosen out for you. By using handwriting as an extension of the heart, the subconscious mind can allow inspiring and insightful knowledge to flow to the fingertips. This divination method of channelling from your guides allows for communication by bypassing the filters and judgements from the conscious mind.
Amie Vello has extensive experience in facilitating this method and offers affordable sessions. If you find that you are seeking some truth and clarity, Amie’s 14 years experience around spiritual attributes will put you at ease. She brings with her a background in counselling (Dip) to provide clients with security and understanding when sharing deep knowledge and vulnerabilities. Care is taken to create a ritualistic space for higher guides to approach and connect with her. Your dreams and desires will be heard and your path will be opened before you. The next step is yours.

Do you have a special token, souvenir or item that intrigues you? Perhaps it belonged to a loved one or found at a flea market. Often we possess a captivation for items when there is a distinct message in its history for us to discover. Psychometry is the clairvoyant practice of reading and sensing the attached stories of a certain object’s history and previous owner through touch. Amie can intuitively sense through different methods such as impressions, images, smells, tastes, sounds, or emotions.
Many understandings of the process of psychometry are often sensory energetic impressions left in the item’s energy and vibrations. Because all existing things are made of energy, psychometry is useful as a method of allowing the energy imprints woven through specific objects come to life again. Amie’s approach is honest, clear and informative of the objects’ stories. Her process may involve her holding the object, sometimes even touching it to her forehead. This method can give you insights like who might’ve owned the item and what experiences they might’ve had during their time with it including emotions, trauma, and insights.
You are highly encouraged to bring your chosen item and finally find out what messages and information it has been holding for you. Amie is ready to receive you and the knowledge intended for you. Your experience will be relaxed and fully guided. You will gain new insights into your loved pieces and loved ones’ lives before you.

The historical crystal ball, sometimes known as an orbuculum, is one of the oldest tools for clairvoyance and divination. This gorgeous and insightful practice spans an active history of over four thousand years. Amie has embraced the art, practising this form for many years to bring you a gentle and honest reading into your world. Scrying, or peering as it is sometimes referred to, is used with clairvoyance for gaining insight through entering a light spiritual trance and becoming aware of symbols within the crystal ball.
Amie may see a variety of telling signs during your session with her. Often she may note concrete pictures and symbols or vague representations of icons. Often these signs will point to information you may be facing in your environment. It is common that you might gain clarification of your choices, feel a sense of ease, or find answers to asked questions. Crystal ball readings remain one of the most powerful methods of clairvoyance and divination. This power is increased when paired with a highly open and skilled medium such as Amie.
If you are seeking a deeper insight into your near and distant future, please book your appointment with Amie for a crystal ball reading. Her abilities will aid you to find new perspectives through the honest and accurate information received.

The closing of Toys 'R' Us has thrown many parents into a panic. We now know for sure that both QC locations will be shutting their doors soon, but one issue that's been left up in the air (until now) is what will happen to the Babies 'R' Us registries of moms-to-be.
A Toys 'R' Us spokesperson delivered the bad news to People yesterday, saying that gift registries will only be available for the next couple of weeks, and parents are responsible for transferring their registry to a different store.
I know many people choose to register for shower gifts at Babies 'R' Us, so I'm sure all of this upheaval is stressful. Babies 'R' Us had a huge selection of clothing, furniture, and gear that will be hard to find at another store. It will certainly be a little chaotic for those having a shower this spring.

The Moving Beyond Racism Book Group will meet on Monday, July 2, to discuss Michael Eric Dyson's "Tears We Cannot Stop: a Sermon to White America." In the book, Dyson asks white Americans to end their defensiveness and what he calls the willful denial of history.
If white America can't let go of its mythological history and recognize its role in one of the worst atrocities ever recorded, we may never become a whole and functioning society, Dyson says. The event will be held at Barnes and Noble, Pittsford Plaza, at 7 p.m.

To accommodate this and make everyday living notches better- affording household the much needed touch of luxury in the very hectic world that we now live in, bathroom remodeling is becoming a must in homes. One feature that makes this most private and often frequented area as organized, functional and beautiful is the collection of bathroom cabinets. And this article discusses how RTA bathroom cabinets can be your ticket to a quality remodeling result without the bank-breaking costs.
In any home improvement project, big or small, one of the keys to success is a well-detailed plan. In remodeling bathrooms, there are crucial considerations that you have to take in mind. So to avoid the hassles, costs and waste of time that any mistake brings, here are important pointers to stick to:
Before Shopping
Before you get excited and impulsive- buying whatever you lay your eyes on, there are several factors to take note of. When shopping, one of the proven ways to get you the best value for your money is through doing your research well. Especially when buying a hot remodeling item such as RTA bathroom cabinets, the choices can be overwhelming. To narrow this down and make sure you get the right product for your project, a checklist with the following information would be helpful:
Get accurate measurements of the available space. This helps you discern what sizes and dimensions will best fit into the space.
Size of bathrooms is another consideration. This will tell us which types of cabinetry to be on the look out for such as free-standing, base, wall-mounted, etc. For smaller bathrooms, free standing RTA bathroom cabinets that are slimmer but taller are ideal.
The overall design of bathrooms and color scheme that you are working on in your remodeling project will determine which door and drawer fronts styles as well as finish you should choose.
Who and how many people use the bathroom? The answer to this will help us get an idea how much storage will be needed to make activities be done in the most efficient way check also Commercial Build Outs.
The great advantages of choosing RTA bathroom cabinets over your traditional alternatives are the cheaper cost that they come in as well as the shorter time. But if you do not do your homework well ahead and buy the wrong sets, then the cost could balloon due to the shipment fees you have to handle as well as the additional wait.
All Wood RTA Bathroom Cabinets
To get the most out of this remodeling project investment, it would be smartest to take advantage of the benefits of all-wood RTA bathroom cabinets. With humidity and spills common in bathrooms, chances of laminate and particleboard lasting is slim and you wouldn’t want to watch your investment fall apart forcing you to undertake an unplanned renovation. All wood RTA cabinets showcase the inherent luxurious look and feel of popular hardwoods. And aside from being beautiful, this option is naturally durable and long lasting.The past is haunting Mike Pompeo, Trump's secretary of state nominee
- 2018-04-16
By Daniel J. McLaughlin
There is a strange irony when Mike Pompeo, Donald Trump's nominee for secretary of state, reaches out to Hillary Clinton.
The former secretary of state and Democratic presidential nominee has good reason to ignore the CIA director - but yet she has been civil, despite her grievances.
Mike Pompeo is the same man who called Clinton's response to the Benghazi attacks in 2012 "morally reprehensible". She underwent 11 hours of questioning before the House Select Committee, and the then-Representative for Kansas was a stand-out with his grilling.
He has also reached out to her successor, John Kerry. The Republican once liked a tweet from his that branded Kerry a "traitor". Pompeo has contacted every other living occupant of the office for guidance. Clinton has been willing to help, according to Politico.
If, and when, Pompeo is confirmed as Trump's new secretary of state, he will take the helm of a State Department he has repeatedly attacked. Foreign Policy argues that he must "answer for the false claims and recycled conspiracies he propagated".
The inquiry, which failed to find any wrongdoing from Clinton, Barack Obama or any high-ranking member of the administration, did not change the public perception of the tragedy, but it undermined the legitimacy of the State Department and raised questions about the competence of its personnel. "The result is," they conclude, "a diplomatic corps that is bruised, demoralised, and risk-averse."
The past is coming back to haunt Pompeo. This was evident in last Thursday's confirmation hearing when Senator Bob Menendez, the ranking Democrat on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, asked which Mike Pompeo he will be asked to vote on. The most telling moment of the hearing, Vox argues, came at the very end. Menendez stopped asking questions, and instead compared the answers to what Pompeo had given at the hearing to what he has previously said, ticking off contradiction after contradiction. The CIA director attempted to paint himself as a less extreme version, despite his hardline opinions on the use of military force, to Islam and LGBT issues.
Pompeo's confirmation was supposed to be a relatively easy one, but the nominee failed to win over any Democrats during his hearing. This may result in an unprecedented move - the CIA chief could be the first secretary of state nominee to receive an unfavourable committee vote since 1925. According to CNN, there are three Democrats - and at least one Republican - on the panel who have signalled they will vote against Pompeo.
Nominations can advance to full confirmation without a favourable recommendation from committee, but it is highly unusual. While there have been no secretary of state nominees following this route in 93 years, other nominees for other roles have squeaked through. However, according to a Congressional Research Service report, from 1987 to 2016, no nominee was confirmed after being reported unfavourably by a committee.
Mike Pompeo is not the first, and he will likely not be the last, person in the Trump administration to have the past haunting them. Like his president, he is controversial, divisive, and combative - and that is perhaps why Donald Trump likes him so much. He may survive the confirmation hearing, but the secretary of state nominee is viewed unfavourably in an unfavourable administration.The Australia Pacific Training Coalition (APTC) is pleased to announce the appointment of Ms Anna Naupa as the new Country Director for Vanuatu and Nauru.

State must ‘go further’ to help addicts – Iain Duncan Smith
23 May 2012 Last updated at 11:07
Some say withdrawing benefits from drug users would lead them into crime
The state should intervene further to help drug and alcohol addicts recover and make them employable in future, a senior cabinet minister will say.
In a speech to Alcoholics Anonymous, Iain Duncan Smith will argue that addicts who are unable to work are being let down by the welfare system.
The BBC understands removing benefits from people refusing treatment will be an option but a “hypothetical” one.
One drug charity said such a move would set a “dangerous precedent”.
In 2010, the Home Office considered plans to remove benefits from addicts who refused treatment as part of the government’s drug strategy but these were not pursued.
According to the Department for Work and Pensions, 40,000 people claim incapacity benefits – citing alcoholism as their primary condition. Of these, about a third have been claiming for more than a decade.
The government also says 80% of the UK’s 400,000 “problem drug users” are claiming out-of-work benefits.
‘Road to recovery’
In a speech in Parliament, Mr Duncan Smith will say “the outdated benefits system fails to get people off drugs and put their lives on track”.
“We have started changing how addicts are supported but we must go further to actively take on the devastation that drugs and alcohol can cause,” he will say.
“We want to do more to encourage and support claimants into rehabilitation for addiction and starting them on the road to recovery and eventually work.”
Mr Duncan Smith will say the introduction of a single, consolidated benefit known as Universal Credit from next year – more details of which will be published on Thursday – will simplify the benefits system and provide more financial incentives for employment, helping all claimants.
“Getting people into work and encouraging independence is our ultimate goal,” he will add.
“Universal Credit will put people on a journey towards sustainable recovery so they are better placed to look for work in future.”
The BBC’s political correspondent Chris Mason said Mr Duncan Smith, in his speech, would hint that a lack of willingness to seek help for addictions could lead to a cut in benefits.
But a source close to the minister emphasised that the universal credit would make it easier to “track people through the system” and ensure they get the help they need.
“Hypothetically people could lose benefits,” the source told the BBC. “You do have to have sanctions. But very few people refuse treatment.”
‘No evidence’
Charities said many addicts were not receiving the support they needed at job centres and through the government’s flagship welfare-to-work programme.
One of these, DrugScope, said it would be asking ministers to “clarify” their position on sanctions for refusing treatment.
“We are surprised and concerned at reports that ministers believe that stopping benefits is an appropriate or effective way of engaging people with drug or alcohol treatment and supporting their recovery,” said its chief executive Martin Barnes
“If accurate, this would be a reversal of the government’s publicly stated position.”
It said ministers had dropped plans, proposed by the previous Labour government, to require all those attending job centres to answer questions about possible drug and alcohol use.
“There is no evidence that using the stick of benefit sanctions will help people to positively engage with treatment and support their recovery,” Mr Barnes added.
“Indeed, the risk is that people will disengage from support services, potentially worsening their dependency and the impacts on their families and communities. Linking benefit to a requirement to undergo treatment would set a dangerous precedent for people with physical or mental health problems.”
All those claiming employment and support allowance – which has replaced incapacity benefit – are currently being re-assessed under plans aimed at getting more people into work and reducing the welfare bill.
Critics have complained that the medical tests being used are flawed and too many people are being deemed fit to work when they are not.

I’ve written before about how things that used to involve money and companies, and therefore appear in “the economy”, no loger have to do so, thanks to the internet. If I needed a place to crash in a strange city, I used to have to pay a hotel. Now I can use all these lovely communication tools to quickly contact a few hundred people, and if one of them or one of their friends can put me up for the night I can find out in a few hours at the outside, save the money, and have a whole different kind of transaction that fills my needs equally well.
The financial version, going to a hotel, contributes to normal measures of economic activity, like GDP, because money was exchanged. I may have made friends with a staff member, but that would be unlikely, and beyond that no relationship is formed. Next time if I have to stay in the same city I’m going to go to the cheapest hotel, not the one where I went the last time, because I’m trying to save money, not keep up with friends.
The non-financial version doesn’t contribute to “the economy”, but it does fill a need, so it seems a bit odd that it wouldn’t count toward the economic life of a society. The interesting thing to me is that the “stay with a friend” experience doesn’t involve hard exchange. It may involve “owing someone a favor” but people don’t think of their relationships like that, and the next time we meet it’s just as likely that either one of us will be the one eager to help the other. But asking for and receiving a favor created a relationship that has a definite economic value. The next time one of us needs something, we’ll be more likely to go to each other, and when asked, we’ll be more likely to help each other.
This sort of thing happens all the time, and has forever. But the ridiculous advances in human communication are taking this phenomenon from a rounding error economically speaking, and turning it into a much more significant cultural force. Like what’s happening in the entertainment industry, it’s easy to look at this and say “fewer purchases from companies are happening and that is bad!” But also just like what’s happening to the entertainment industry, there’s still economic activity, and there are more relationships being forged among people. It’s easy to dismiss human relationships as wishy-washy stuff not worthy of analysis, but to do so would be wrong. Not morally wrong, just sloppy thinking and bad analysis.
Trying to define the monetary value of a friendship is difficult if not impossible. And we all know that friendships matter in non-monetary ways, but there’s an easy mistake to make in assuming that creating a friendship isn’t a form of economic production.
I’ve been trying to think of a framework for understanding this for a little while, and I think I’ve got a decent one. And it’s this:
Money and the Internet are both solutions to coordination problems
In trying to understand this non-monetary economic activity, I went back to think about how we got money in the first place. It’s a medium of exchange that greases the wheels. Intrinsically it has no actual use, unlike cheese, farm labor, or a boat. But if we invent a whole category of thing that itself has no intrinsic value, but we all agree to act as if it does and swap it for stuff, we can drastically speed up the rate at which our economy can function.
It’s easier to trade stuff if we have money. And it’s easier to go places and buy things without bringing your herd of sheep with you for bartering purposes. We started with money backed by gold, for which we also had decorative uses, but now we’re just using paper and agreeing to say it’s worth something because if we do create this whole extra commodity called money with its own kind of value, it makes it easier to do stuff that involves other people (and their skills and resources, etc.). Keep hold of that: money makes it easier to do stuff with other people.
And then we come to the internet, and the part of this post where I assert things about the speed of communication just like I usually do: The internet is changing everything. We’re more able to communicate with each other than ever before by a lot, and we’re able to talk to giant swathes of people, and without even the bother of calling them all on the phone. Also we’re more aware of our own relationships than we ever have been before, “Oh, LinkedIn says I know a guy who knows a guy who knows that guy who might give me a job. Interesting… I didn’t know I had an in there…”. And it’s easier to monitor and capitalize on those relationships to achieve goals. The internet, quite obviously, is making it easier to reach out to people and accomplish things with them. The internet makes it easier to do stuff with other people.
So, money and the internet both solve similar kinds of coordination problems. And the solutions to both kinds of problem contribute to the economic health of a society. But our ways of measuring “the economy” only include the money-problems, because up to this point the number of economically important coordination problems solved without money has been tiny. And so in order to understand economies it’s been pretty much sufficient to understand money – how it’s created, how fast it’s moving, how it’s valued, etc. And for now it might still be good enough, but the volume of economically important tasks that get completed without the use of money is only going to keep growing. And we need new ways to think of the economy that include those tasks.
I think that human connectivity is a good metric to start from, since the number and quality of connections or potential connections determine (at least partially) how well new collaborations can arise. To build a metric for this that you could actually use you’d have to look at the normal social interconnectedness of a given community (geographic or otherwise), at the prevalence of different communications technologies and methods, at the frequency of their use, and probably at some deeply difficult to construct wishy-washy measures of human fellow-feeling. Good luck constructing those.
Huh. So does that mean the internet is going to replace money?
No. But it does mean that some things that used to be accomplished best with money are going to be better accomplished with the internet. Well, honestly it’s possible to imagine a distant future where we have perfect Borg-like communication technology and money becomes useless, but it’s far enough off in post-singularity-land that I’m not going to worry about it at all.
The interesting questions to me are these:
- Which kinds of collaboration, or which parts of each collaborative task, are more efficiently done with the Interent than with money for any given level of communications technology? And how do we maximize value in the things we do by picking the right collaborative medium, or mix of media?
- How do we understand the strength, health, or productivity of a society in terms of both human connectivity and money? It’s obvious that human relationships have value, both intrinsically and in terms of the tasks they can help accomplish. But it might be impossible to define that value in terms of money. So how do we account for it?
I’ll leave you with an example. Take two small 19th century towns, both alike in dignity. But one of them’s Amish. And then someone’s barn burns down in each of the two towns. It’s easy to imagine the Amish town banding together and hastily rebuilding and getting the town back to full production. And the other town has family relationships and friends and some merchants to provide goods in exchange for money. The other town might get back on its feet quickly as well, but probably not as quickly. It’s the interconnectedness of the Amish town that converts into a higher economic value, with or without the use of money.
So what I’m saying is that the internet is making us all more Amish. Bring on the scrapple & beards!Working WITH US

Youth Customer Flow Scenarios Now Available: Three new stories demonstrate the flow of welcoming and guiding a young person to the appropriate staff member in order to ensure high quality American Job Center (AJC) service is provided to all youth.
Spanish AJC Customer Flow Scenarios: The AJC Customer Flow Scenarios have been highly successful as a resource for AJC customers and as a staff training tool. To expand their usefulness to a broader customer base, a Spanish translation is now available.
Many states and local areas have expressed a need for staff development tools that help train AJC staff, while enabling them to work collaboratively and seamlessly across programs.
These stories demonstrate the characteristics of a high-quality one-stop center, as described in TEGL 04-15:
The initial AJC Customer Flow Scenarios booklet of five scenarios illustrates a diverse set of customers and situations encountered by AJC staff:
- Sam has an undisclosed disability and needs guidance on reasonable accommodations and other rights under the Americans with Disabilities Act as he returns to the labor force.
- Charles is an employer seeking guidance to hire and accommodate workers with disabilities and is seeking resources on employee retention.
- Juana is a farmworker who needs to lodge a pay complaint, and additionally requires housing and education assistance.
- Jim wants to get back to work after being incarcerated.
- Adele is a single mother transitioning from public assistance to sustainable employment.
The NEW Youth AJC Scenarios introduce a variety of solutions and resources to assist youth oryoung adults who seek assistance at an AJC. It is not a comprehensive guide of all available programs, nor is it limited to how assistance is provided. These stories introduce a variety of needs that young adults have and exemplify the importance of ensuring youth and young adults are welcomed and guided to the appropriate staff.
This booklet includes three scenarios that illustrate three youth seeking career services.
- Josh is a Caucasian youth in search of work. The AJC youth workforce specialist is able to offer him additional services to help him establish a career pathway.
- Kisha is an African American youth with a visual impairment interested in attending college. She has little information about colleges and available accommodations.
- Julia is a Hispanic youth who completed 10th grade before dropping out of school. She needs a job and wants training that will generate a career.Ithilien finishing details
As I was closing in on finishing the Ithilien Brocade Jacket, I was finally faced with some decisions that had been pretty easy to put off until that point. I knew generally where I wanted to go with it, but couldn’t hammer out some of those details until I actually got there.
One of those areas was the collar; the plan was to miter the cable on the front band to turn the corner on each side, then pick up neck edge stitches as I worked toward meeting in the back. The big questions were 1) where exactly on the cable would I reach the miter point, and 2) would they collide when they met at the center back? Oh, yes, and how would that come together with the center back cable? It was way too much to hope that they could be seamlessly grafted – I was just hoping it would not turn out to be a three-way crash.
So, the miter turned out pretty well… the knotwork balanced nicely on each side of the pivot point. As with the rest of the cable, the ‘upstream’ pointy end is a little pointier than the ‘downstream’ end, but I can live with that. Since the neckband curves, the cable design is a bit compressed in some areas, but again, that is to be expected.
Sure enough, there wasn’t quite enough room to put in a center ‘knot’. Nor would the loose end of the center back cable band fit in. I toyed with the idea of joining them all into a triskele, but there wasn’t quite enough room for that, either. So I settled on i-cord growing from the cables, with a leaf-shaped tip.
And, in the interest of continuity, I did the same thing on the bottom of the front cables.
Next up was the issue of button placement. I’d been mulling this over for some time, and had decided early on that the buttons should not be on the cabled band at all; I did not want to hide those cables. So a double i-cord edging for the center front seemed an ideal solution. The buttons would be highlighted against the blue-green, and the buttonholes would be nearly invisible between the two rows of i-cord. I worked the first row along both center fronts, then started a new row all the way around the center fronts, neckband and lower edge, grafting the ends together.
But the neckband facing had to come before the i-cord. I had fun shading the cuff facings, but decided to go with a solid bronze for the neckband. Besides the fact that it would look much more finished (and the neckband facing would show, unlike the cuff facing), the stranding on the inside of the cables would be nicely protected from snags.
In the photos of the cables and the sweater turned inside out, you can easily see the color progression; this was the part of the sweater design that actually gave me the biggest headache, and took the most time.
I started buying yarn in 2005, but shelved the whole idea when I couldn’t find a bronze-colored yarn that suited me OR enough background colors that were close enough to shade from one to the next, and similar enough in value to avoid obvious striping.
Picking up the project idea again in 2007, I started buying single balls of yarn from a variety of sources. Local yarn shops are always best, since you can see and feel the actual yarn, and can compare it to yarn you already have. Unfortunately, there doesn’t seem to be a big demand in my area for fingering-weight 100% wool. I found plenty of sock yarn with nylon, but that’s not what I was after. There are, of course, lots of online sources, but colors on a monitor are always iffy. Color cards helped with those LYS special orders as well as online, but a single snippet doesn’t tell you everything about how a number of colors will work together. So I still have a number of colors that I didn’t use in this sweater, but I expect I’ll use them in something some day.
When the dust settled, I ended up with yarns from three different manufacturers: Brown Sheep Nature Spun, KnitPicks Palette and JaggerSpun 2/8. Some are heathers, some solids. Some are fairly loosely-spun two-ply, some are more firmly spun three-ply. But amazingly enough, they all ended up looking pretty much like they were made for each other. I spent a LOT of time swatching, and then washed the resulting fabric, and was pleased to find that the firm yarns bloomed and the looser yarns firmed up with the relatively snug gauge. (I got a little bit hooked on the swatching. I still don’t know for sure whether it was the voyage of discovery or fear of commitment…) The resulting fabric is surprisingly light and drapey.
I used three shades of blue, three of green, and three of purple. The general sequence goes (three rows of each color): green, blue-green, blue, blue-purple, purple, blue-purple, blue, blue-green, green and so on, but with more color variants in between.
I still think I would recommend going with the same brand of yarn for a project whenever possible, but when it isn’t, for whatever reason, it’s worth experimenting. Since I wasn’t in a big hurry, and (mostly) enjoyed the experimentation, it definitely worked for me!
Had to smile — I thought the leaf tip was a little snake’s head!
Yeah, they do look kind of snakey! One of these days, I might just snip-snip and have another go at them…
Trying to convey the wonder/admiration…

madbarber13No one in this house dresses on Christmas. I don't cook. We play with our toys in front of the fire. Nap. Watch the movies Santa brought (Kung-Fu Panda I & II). We listen to the last of the Christmas music. We read the books once wrapped in red and green paper while under blankets (this year, the kids got the Last Wild Witch, Naked Mole Rat Gets Dressed, Conejito). I drink coffee. We eat leftovers and large clunky candy canes from Hammonds. I don't want to go anywhere. That is the last of the grief rituals we have. Prepare for a bad day. Hunker down. Make a weep-friendly zone. Play when you can.
My children were Santa-happy this year. Santa this and Santa that. Beezus told me this morning she heard Rudolph's nose when the reindeer were on our roof. You know, the noise his nose makes when it is blinking on the 1964 TV special. I thought I saw the Easter Bunny when I was a kid. Standing in my living room. I was four. And the Easter Bunny looked like the one from Hess' Department Store. He filled our baskets. The crazy thing is that my sister has the same exact memory. So, yeah, the Rudolph thing, I get it. I also completely support that delusion, because it might buy me a year or so before she notices me and Santa have the same exact taste in toys.
This year, Beezus wanted robotic animals. Perhaps in Japanese Astrology, 2011 was the year of the Robot Kitty. Specifically, she wanted a white cat that meows and purrs and walks, and a dog too, with a leash. A robot dog. I remind her that she has a real dog and his name is Jack and she is welcome to walk him any dang minute of the day. She rolls her eyes and sighs. This robot doggie is white and has a leash. It is small and fluffy and has a pink bow and is named GoGo, she explains. I roll my eyes and sigh. The robot kitty cat has been meowing for weeks in the basement. It drives me insane. I would hear it and say something like, "I think I just got a text message."
This year I received some glass blown straws, and silver Mexican earrings, and socks I wrapped for myself. I love everything. Particularly watching Thor open one gift at a time and just play, even though more gifts sit there wrapped. Beezus tells me repeatedly that Thor still has gifts to open and should she help him? "I have a new matchbox car," he seems to say like a little monk, "Why do I need more?"
Something has been nagging at me all season. It is this thing I haven't quite articulated yet. And I'm not sure how to explain why it is so difficult. So I will just explain it. Beezus and Thor are almost exactly three years apart. His birthday falls five days before hers, but essentially, they hit the same milestones at the same time of the year.
You know what I am saying?
So, Thor is exactly the same age Beezus was when Lucy died.
I don't remember Christmas 2008. Lucia was dead four days. After the funeral home picked up her body on Christmas Eve, the funeral director was at our house asking what kind of urn we wanted. On Christmas Eve. Christmas morning, I was three days post-partum. Beezus received a play kitchen that year. I only know that because I saw a picture of her playing with the kitchen Christmas morning. There was a bow on it.
See, I don't remember much of Beezus at this age. I have been told I was a good mother to her, that I seemed completely absorbed in whatever she was doing right at that moment. I remember reading my journals and blogs around that time that being with Beezus made me very present. That I felt moments of happiness because her spirit is this large happy Buddha spirit and I could turn off some of the refrain: "Lucy is dead. I can't believe Lucy is dead." But that Christmas, I wailed most of the day. I have snippets, like a dream vignette in a movie. I remember wondering how I was going to live this life. I remember wondering if you can die from obsessive thinking and heartbreak. I remember being so afraid of Beezus dying, and wanting to hold her and not let her out. I wondered if every Christmas would be so fucking terrible and gut-wrenching. I didn't think I would ever like the holidays again. I wondered if I would have a stocking for Lucy or not the next year, because I had already filled her stocking when she died. (Incidentally, we don't hang a stocking for her, but we do hang all the ornaments with her name sent to us on her first birthday.) In 2008, we ate carrots for Christmas, because we simply couldn't function enough to cook anything else. We didn't even peel the carrots, we ate those little silly carrots that are made little by some machine.
Thor is still so little. I can't believe it. It keeps catching me off-guard. He doesn't quite talk, nor does he not talk. He communicates through a series of half-words, grunts, hand gestures, real words, and emotional responses like kicking shit and throwing himself on the ground. This week, he began grabbing a pillow, putting it down, and then throwing himself on it to have a tantrum. I admire his dedication to comfort. He likes cars, and making roads for his cars. He likes making off-road terrain for his cars, like my belly or my head. He kisses and draws and paints and sings songs. So many songs. So many heartbreaking songs.
Fuck.
There are so many layers to her death, so much that changed that day. I remember one thing specifically about Christmas 2008. I sat with a heating pad on my belly, uterus still contracting, on the couch. My milk came in that day, so my breasts formed hard painful pulsing lumps of grief. I tucked cabbage into my bra, and ice packs. Milk ran down my belly. Beezus wanted mostly nothing to do with me. The baby was dead. And I was sad. On Christmas, she came near me and crawled on my lap. It had been the first time nearly in two days that she wanted comfort from me. Sam left the room. I had begun to cry because her distance was so hard for me after Lucy's death. I couldn't bear it. Beezus rested her head on my breast, and I said, "Do you understand what is happening, Beezus?'
She shook her head no.
And I said, "Remember the baby in Mama's belly?" And she touched my belly.
 what I remember about Christmas 2008. And I guess, stupidly, I thought Beezus understood that Lucy was dead. I thought that conversation gave her a kind of compassion and understanding. I see Thor now, and I can't believe how little he is. He is 20 months old. And I don't know if he gets that he has a sister that died either. After I post this, I am going to lie on the floor in front of the fire and drink a cafe au lait. I warm the milk in the microwave and use the little frother and pour in Kenya AA. It is a respite and a comfort to drink coffee that way. That is something Lucy's death taught me, to enjoy a moment of peace even if it is couched with a thousand torturous moments of grief.
how is it that our daughters could die years apart from eachother and somehow we seemed to have collapsed in similar ways, different ways too, but I see your grief and my grief which is so recent and it rushes my own memories back to me. My sobbing, my worry that Daryl and Kai would die. I have only left Kai for 2 hours with someone else except when I go to work since Camille died. I feel like I tried to focus on Kai but knew in the moment that I was distant even if I was staring in his general direction.
I remember telling Kai that Camille died and seeing that he kind of got it and kind of didn't and needing to hug and hold him tight...I was so grateful for the nap we took together in the hospital bed...curled together. This Christmas well you know about our conversation about ashes the other night...but children are resiliant and when his cousin and uncles came last night he went and got the ashes down and shwed them...I didn't know what to do. It's not like they are off limits but it's not show and tell...but for an almost 3 year old I guess it is. It is his life and so I just supported him in his process although I was cringing on the inside. I think carrots are better than the ordered out pizza we had but I feel so unmotivated. We keep on keeping on for the love of our little ones. I am so glad we have them to buoy us in this. We opened presents and played then we meditated and talked about what we are grateful for before putting him down for a nap. Our Camillia plant that was given to us after Camille died just bloomed big pink blossoms with yellow centers. I took two blooms with a note down to our neighbor who's daughter was my postpartum nurse in the hospital. I thanked her and shed a couple tears.
I am glad you have a weep friendly zone. That you have your coffee and you have your two babies...I wish you had three. Sending you a giant hug. Thinking of Lucy and Camille. Wishing just wishing it was so very different...and trying to be thankful for what we DO have.
Lots of love to you today and every day.
Your description of Christmas 2008 was so painful to read. The bow on the play kitchen. Your conversation with Beezus. How little he is, how little she was. Sometimes the 'wrong-ness' of this situation just hits me, how topsy turvy it is, to prepare a Christmas stocking that turns out to be unnecessary. It shouldn't be.
And I don't know. I thought J understood, with the wisdom of the new born. Maybe she did. Then. But now? I don't know. Maybe she will understand it all in a flash or maybe she will sit and pick away at it for the rest of her life (perhaps it simply depends which of her parents she takes after and it doesn't take a genius to figure which path I'm following)
And, past the point, but I've just ordered Naked Mole Rat Gets Clothes for J. It looks fab. We love the Pigeon books here. I didn't know there was one about a Naked Mole Rat and I'm pleased to discover that there is.
Hope you find more of those moments of peace xo
Christmas 2008 was brutal for so many of us. I remember a lot of it, though I wish I didn't.
You're description of grief being layered is so perfect.
I don't even think we'll uncover all of those layers in our life time. I know new things about my grief will always keep revealing themselves to me.
I'm surprised at how often I can keep being surprised by it all, if you know what I mean.
Love to you and your beautiful family at this difficult time of year.
xo
Beautifully written. Grief is so hard to describe.
So incredibly heartbreaking. I admire your ability to put yourself out there in words, to put your grief out there and recreate such difficult moments. It helps me to process my own horribly painful moments. I just don't have the strength (ability? talent?) to flesh them out into words for the world. I wish I did. I loved this post in all its rawness and description.
Your Christmas this year sounds nice. We like to be lazy and just enjoy each other's company too. I am so sorry that yours will always include flashbacks to when Lucy died. I always remember how I was 13 weeks along and blissfully pregnant with Ella. That was the last time I was truly happy.
You won my giveaway. I can't wait to send the ornament to you. Can you send me your info? Briannemeg@yahoo.com
I don't remember much about Christmas Day 2008 except that it was the first day for two and a half months that I didn't cry. I made up for it in the days before and the days after but that day was a tiny, tiny first moment of respite - and it breaks my heart all over again to know that for someone else - for you - it was a brutal and broken day.
Christmas 2011 sounds just right.
 something Lucy's death taught me, to enjoy a moment of peace even if it is couched with a thousand torturous moments of grief.
*******************
Ruthless, vicious flames of sorrow - and how tightly you bound them in words, Angie.
A friend is struggling to stop drinking after four decades of finding what comfort she could in the bottle.
I often tell her I think she's *more* honest, more sane than most people. If honesty about grief were as common as I wish it were, drinking to survive would be about the only option.
Obviously, thinking this way is no answer in the long (maybe even the short) run.
But if anyone knows grief - truly knows grief - and doesn't desperately long for something, anything to take the edge off,
...then they don't know grief at all.
You do. The agony is hateful, so pitiless. I so, so, so wish you didn't have to know it.
I admire you beyond words for fighting back and kicking at the bourbon even while you swim through this Hell.

Oh, those raw first days. Angie, it still breaks my heart that you had to explain this to Beezus.

All of them are experienced musicians, sharing the same idea that there is room for a new Dutch band with a foundation of metal, rock and electronica. The meaning of the band name KONKR33T is a combination of “concrete” in English and “concreet” in Dutch which is translated as “actual” and “specific”. The first single has been released in 2017, the first EP is expected in January 2018.Israel’s Rafael Advanced Defense Systems and India’s Bharat Dynamics Limited (BDL) will be signing a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) for joint induction of an Anti-Torpedo Defence System called SHADE for the Indian Navy.

SHADE will be the first system in the world to employ a combination of soft kill and hard kill decoys, thereby providing a robust and effective defence against modern torpedoes.
The joint induction of SHADE is part of Rafael's commitment to the ‘Atmanirbhar Bharat’ (self-reliance) initiative of the Government of India.
This MoU will be a precursor for cooperation on futuristic systems for the Indian Armed Forces in India, entailing advanced ToT, and a very high indigenous content, leading to self-sufficiency in the field of cutting-edge technology in defence. This MoU represents an ideal opportunity for industrial cooperation between Israel and India, leading to closer collaboration and co-development of advanced systems in India, the companies said in a joint statement.
Parties will work together to identify joint opportunities for export, subject to export control guidelines of the two governments.

Roghiyeh Bigdeli, a resident of Karaj, was arrested during the days of the nationwide uprising in January 2020. Intelligence forces violently arrested her on January 11, 2020. She spent some time in Kachouii Prison of Karaj before being released.
Ultimately, the Revolutionary Court of Karaj sentenced Ms. Bigdeli to five years of suspended prison term and two years of internal exile in Zanjan. The Appeal Court later commuted this sentence to two years of suspended jail term and two years of internal exile.
Since Ms. Bigdeli did not report in to serve her time in exile, the Court of Karaj increased the period for her compulsory residence in Zanjan by one-third.
On the events of the January 2020 nationwide uprising in Iran, Amnesty International reported:
“Iranian security forces used unlawful force against peaceful protesters who gathered across Iran following the authorities’ admission that they had shot down a Ukrainian passenger plane on January 8.” eyewitness, Mahsa from Tehran, described how security forces fired tear gas into the entrance hall of a metro station to stop people leaving to join the protest.
“There was so much tear gas… I was so mentally stressed and anxious that I initially didn’t even realize that I had been shot… The special forces of the police were firing pointed pellets at people. My coat is now filled with holes, and I have bruises on my body… The streets were filled with armed plain-clothes agents firing shots into the air and threat(en)ing to shoot people… A member of the security forces chased me when they saw me filming the protest and that’s when I was shot in the leg with a pointed pellet… I’m in a lot of pain,” she said. jobs like building projects, house renovations, yard cleanups or maybe commercial cleanups.

Please enable and refresh the page. Show commentsAmy Peterson (writing plays under the pen name Ash Sanborn) aspires to be a playwright and has e-published her play, along with other writings. She explains her varied and unique approach to networking and marketing.
1. Pretend for a moment I’m a director or producer looking for my next play. Pitch me one of your plays in five to ten sentences.
The Feast of Jovi Bono (known to friends as TFOJB) is a new play, a challenge to actors to tell their stories in slam poetry/spoken word art. It’s the story of forgiveness between mothers and daughters, exes, the life-beaten and the life that beat them. What if a tent city moved next door to your house? You’re just one person – what can one person do to help create life from destruction?
Most plays in this century do not have a narrator, but ours has a snarky chef to make us laugh and tie the feast together. There’s a rugby game, cake getting all over, an expanding table that Malcolm (Jovi’s best friend) keeps tripping over, padparadsha oranges, and stories that light up the night.
2. What motivated you to become a playwright?
TJOJB has not had the usual development process mostly because of the slam poetry. First I did send it to the developmental readers at my local theater (Spencer Community Theater in Iowa) and of the three readers, two of them had very helpful feedback. I took many of their suggestions. The next step would have been a staged reading in which I would have found a partner-director, assembled the cast (which usually consists of whoever shows up) and had one or at most two rehearsals. The reading would be in front of an invited audience who would then provide further feedback. This is where the process broke down: the slam poetry is actually quite a challenge to the actors and would require more than a rehearsal or two for any one to effectively perform it. A cold reading would create the effect the early readers feared: that it would be a group of actors standing around reciting poetry. If that’s the case, what on earth are we doing?
From there I sent the script to a few publishers, all of whom said it was not for them, but to please consider sending them any future plays. They weren’t getting it. The slam poetry cannot be confined to the page. Then I received an email from Stageplays.com. They were dipping their toes into e-publishing plays – a very new concept – and for a very reasonable price, I could partner with them to get the script out there, available to directors, along with my contact information so I could work with them on staging it. TFOJB will have its premiere Labor Day weekend. It is my hope that video and other promotional material uploaded on Stageplay’s website will help artistic directors and performance committees from theaters throughout the nation decide this is something they need to do for their theaters and for their communities.
3. Have you been traditionally published? Why or why not?
I have always been an indie author, even with my memoir and novel, probably because I am a control freak. I had an offer from a traditional publisher for each of those books, but in conversations with editors at those houses, I realized they didn’t get it. They were taking extremely divergent directions from my vision on story lines and format, and I realized in the case of each book, it would become something it was not. There are days I wonder, if I’d not been so committed to my artistic integrity, if I would be more as an author now. In the business of publishing, I’d undoubtedly of been a greater force by now. However, as a writer and artist, I would have shrunk.
4. How have you liked self-publishing so far?
I don’t consider indie authorship self-publishing, maybe because that phrase has become a profanity in the industry. I haven’t liked it in my other projects because I am simply not enough of a self-promoter to make it work well. However, there are new ways of promotion and delivery to readers and others growing almost daily. I am so excited about e-readers, new applications and other technology to delivery my words, that I am finishing my degree (finally) in a BFA Creative Writing program specializing in writing for visual media.
5. Tell me about the marketing techniques you’ve used to sell your writing. Which ones have been the most successful?
With TFOJB, I have several efforts happening at once. I have unabashedly added dozens of actors, directors and producers on LinkedIn and Facebook. With that audience, I then post my video trailers for their perusal, and through social networking I also attempt to build relationships with those decision makers to give TFOJB a larger, hopefully national, stage. I have had some amazing conversations with some fairly high level producers and other movers and shakers in New York, Chicago and Minneapolis theater worlds. No one has signed a contract yet, but they are reading, thinking and considering.
I am also funding the world premiere on RocketHub through a crowdfunding effort. I do not believe we have seen the potential of crowdfunding to bring independent literature and theater the attention it deserves.
6. Are there any marketing techniques you intentionally avoided or discontinued, and if so, why?
I have no intention of taking out ads because I have yet to think of an ad campaign that would target the right individuals and make them any more interested than developing personal relationships through social networking has done.
7. What’s the most important thing you’ve learned about self-publishing that you didn’t know when you started out?
Promotion, promotion, promotion. I am 40 years old and am only now figuring out that it isn’t that my writing talent isn’t enough to launch my projects to success; it’s that it is not enough on its own.
I have spent years developing myself as an artist and figuring the audience would find its own way. There’s so many distractions for an audience today that they in fact will not find their own way but they need a beacon to light the way. Promotion is not selling out as an artist or writer; it’s lighting the way for your readers and audience to find what they didn’t know they were looking for. If it’s the right audience, they will realize when they see my work that it’s what they were seeking all along.
8. If you could do one thing differently in publishing your writing, what would it be?
I have tended to push my work out there when I was so tired of looking at it; when I felt that further changes were not improving it, really, but just changing it more. However, in the clear vision of hindsight, I find that one more edit would have put it closer to where I would want it to be.
9. Independent writers face the obvious challenge of marketing their books and other writing without the resources of traditional publishers. What advice do you have for an indie writer just starting out?
Believe in yourself. You have a voice; make sure what you’re putting out there is authentic. Keep talking until someone listens, then make sure your words, your baby, your creation, is all you believed it to be when the inspiration first hit you. Don’t write to what you think the audience will pay to read, hear or see. Write from your mind and soul.
Make your craft as good as it gets. Then step out into the light and if you have the swift confidence of faith in yourself they will gather. They will listen. They will hear. They will know. They will believe, too.
10. What projects are you currently working on?
At the moment all my energy is poured into TFOJB and Labor Day weekend. I am recrafting the next play in this series: Brigid Kildare’s Steelworks. Just briefly, that is a play about, among many other things, the legendary friendship between Brigid and Patrick of Ireland. I was first writing this play for National Playwriting Month in November 2009, and got through the first act.
I put it away to develop TFOJB. In November 2010, I found out a high school classmate of mine was in prison and had been for years, and on Facebook his friend said he was depressed because his mother had passed away and it seemed no one was writing to him. I thought surely I could send some light and cheer. I wrote a letter. My soul’s twin wrote back. Now we are collaborating on a crazy number of projects, not the least of which is a story about his life. We also have a legendary friendship so unlikely it’s as though I wrote it into life.
I’m truly not sure how to indie publish all of that, but one day sooner rather than later it will happen. Brigid Kildare’s Steelworks is also undergoing a rework to incorporate restorative justice and the crushing sameness of a long prison term.
In my spare time (ha!) I’m developing a short story collection. My short story, “Namesake”, was a finalist in the Lorian Hemingway Short Story Competition in 2010. The second story for that collection, “The First Thing He Noticed Was Her Legs”, is a reader favorite but has not yet placed in a competition. I plan to release this collection independently, making as much use of e-publishing and reader apps as possible and also exploring the addition of visual media to the stories.
11. If you could market your brand – not just one particular book or play, but your overall brand of writing – in one sentence, what would it be?
There’s sainthood in all of us – I don’t care who you are, where you’ve been, what you’ve done – you can change the world for the better.

Here are our ideas on keeping and looking after your paint task:
INTERIOR PAINTWORK MAINTENANCE
- Advised time to clean after a paint task is 2 weeks after application of the final top coat– this is to eliminate any dust which has been collected.
- Bulk of paints used on interior walls are washable.
- This indicates they can be periodically cleaned with a milk soap water solution. Utilizing a sponge and moderate soap solution lightly scrub the locations that have any light discolorations or marks. Note that very old and stubborn stains are challenging to remove and ought to not be constantly scrubbed hard as this might lead to long-term damage to the paint work.
- To avoid stubborn spots ensure any spots are tidied up immediately to prevent drying up and becoming irreversible.
- Regular cleaning helps preserve the look of the paint job and it is suggested to clean and wash walls as soon as a month.
- For locations vulnerable to dirt and marks, e.g. Children’s rooms, it is suggested to get a single coat of paint done every two years approximately.
- It is important that you frequently examine your walls for any signs of peeling paint as this can be the very first sign of more major issues such as water damage or seepage issues. As soon as you discover any issue locations it is important to get the expert recommendations from a painting specialist and take care of and damage right away to prevent more serious problems.
- Any locations exposed to sunshine, particularly doors and windows frames, will lose shine in time. It is advised to apply a single coat every two years to keep them looking fresh.
EXTERIOR PAINTWORK MAINTENANCE
- Ensure you frequently inspect the exterior of your house to guarantee you are on top of any changes or abnormalities. Whilst gardening or pottering around the backyard be sure to do a visual examination of your exterior. If you observe any problems such as peeling paint or any other problems that are calling out for repair be sure to have an expert contractor look at the concern and suggest the best ways to progress without needing to wait till the problem gets any worse.
- All window sills and door frames have to be looked for bubbles and fading. These functions may have to be sanded back and re-painted with one coat to maintain that brand name new look every 2 years.
- After you have checked for any issue locations or repairs it is important to keep in mind how filthy the exterior is. It is vital to periodically wash down your exterior as dirt starts to gather. The more frequently you do this, the less the develop. Annual washing is frequently specified as a condition of service warranties offered by paint producers and painting applicators.
- Please note that high-pressure cleaning can actually damage your paint finish. It is recommended to carry out normal pressure cleaning with your garden hose pipe and a soft brush to loosen dirt. This will brighten your paint surface substantially.
Be proactive in your exterior maintenance. This will guarantee your paint job lasts more years and will decrease the need for regular re-painting.
- Failure to carry out proactive upkeep, especially the failure to every year wash outside surfaces may void the service warranty supplied by the paint producer and painting applicators.

Talked to the Sqn clerk and was told I'm posted to BTL as of 18 July and then on to OJT (likely back at the Regiment lol). I've done some looking at the CFSMI website and wasn't able to find any course dates so I'm just wondering if the dates posted here (as well as the one George posted)are still good or if anyone associated with CFSMI can give an updated list.

Spectacles are said to make you look like a scholarly nerd. So, most of us try not to wear spectacles. But have you seen the models in eye-care ads? They look so stylish and beautiful. When you wear prescription eyewear regularly, you get marks on your nose and under your eyes. If you are experiencing these problems, you should deal with it immediately.
Before Choosing Spectacles:
Spectacles are your windows to the world when you wear them constantly. Before you choose your spectacles, make sure that they are not heavy.
- Heavy glasses can lead to the appearance of marks on the bridge of your nose.
- When you use it for a long time, these marks deepen.
- Continuous usage of spectacles can also cause pigmentation.
- This in turn makes your skin darker.
- Wearing tight spectacles can also cause marks on the bridge of your nose.
So, you can see that heavy glasses leave marks on your nose. So, try to choose lightweight glasses that fit well and have soft frames. Here are some remedies to erase those marks on your nose from glasses:
Best Home Remedies to Remove Spectacle Marks:
Try to remove your spectacles from your eyes whenever it is possible. This helps in reducing the pressure that is caused on the areas around your eyes and nose. As you take them off, you can try some of the home remedies mentioned below to help you get rid of the marks. So, try them out and stop looking like a racoon.
Apply Rose water for your eyes:
Rose water is a natural skin toner and great for the skin. If you have spectacle marks, all you have to do is to dip a soft cotton pad in rose water and rub the affected area with it. Let it remain on your skin for a while and then you can wash it off with water. You can use it just as you use a toner when your take care of your skin. With regular use you will see that the dark marks are fading away.
Don’t toss those potato peels:
Potatoes are used not only for cooking. It has beauty benefits also. After you peel the potato, grate it or take slices of potato and make them into a paste. Apply this potato paste well over the dark spots created by your glasses. You can wait for about 15 minutes and then wash it off with cool water. Try to apply potato paste regularly over the affected area and soon you will see that the marks are fading away. Slowly they will fade away completely.
Eye Cooling Gel Aloe vera:
The gel or juice that is extracted from the leaf of aloe vera has lots of benefits. It helps in soothing your skin. All you have to do is to take out some gel from the freshly cut leaf of aloe vera and apply it over the darkened area. Wait till the gel dries and then you can wash it off with cool water. With regular use of this gel you can get rid of the spectacle marks very effectively. This gel is also good for removing scars.
Give yourself a massage:
A massage is also very effective for getting rid of the marks left by spectacles. Apply some almond oil on the dark areas and massage the area with your finger tips. This helps in lightening the dark areas and getting rid of the marks on your nose as a result of wearing glasses. The vitamin E present on almond oil is great for your skin and keeps your skin well nourished.
Grab a cold cucumber:
Cucumber is also good for reducing the marks left by spectacles. Slice a cucumber and apply the slices over the areas darkened with the use of glasses. These slices help in cooling your eyes and also work on the scars effectively. Instead of using cucumber slices, you can also squeeze out the juice of cucumber and apply it on the darkened areas. If slicing the cucumber and taking the juice of cucumber seem like a lot of work, then you can simply rub a slice of cucumber around your eyes. It also works effectively in getting rid of the spectacle marks.
Honey:
Mix honey with some milk and oat. This mixture is very effective for getting rid of the spectacle marks. Apply this mixture on the darkened areas and then wait for 15 to 20 minutes. Wash it off with water. Soon you will start getting positive results. Both milk and honey are great for the skin.
Lemons:
You can use lemons instead of cucumber and get the same results. Cut a lemon and squeeze out the juice from it. Now you have to add equal quantity of water to this juice. Apply this solution on the affected areas with a cotton wool. Wait for about 15 minutes and then you can rise with cool water. Lemon juice has bleaching properties. So, with regular application of this solution the pigmentations on the skin and other marks will fade away.
Using orange peels:
Orange peels work wonders for your skin. They are very effective for getting rid of the under eye circles and the marks left by constant use of spectacles. Dry orange peels and then grind them to get a fine powder. Now mix some milk with this powder to get a smooth paste. You can apply this paste on the dark areas. Wait for about 15 minutes and then rinse with water. This helps in nourishing your skin and also makes your skin lightened.
Now that you have seen various ways to get rid of spectacle marks, try them out and see how well they workout for you.Despite all the similarities and differences between Battlefield and Call of Duty series, one feature which all battlefield fans would love to borrow from Call of Duty series is custom loadout slots. It seems that the devs finally listened to its fans as that feature will soon make its way to Battlefield 4 as posted by the Battlelog Dveloper “DarkLord” on reddit.
This news was confirmed by him on reditt but there is a catch. The presets will be battlelog exclusive which means that you will have to minimize the game and log-in to battlelog every time you want to change a custom loadout. Here is what Darklord said on this matter
Presets are a Battlelog only feature, so in-game you won’t see anything other than your Loadout.
Essentially it works like this:
- Go to Battlelog
- Select a preset
- Preset gets applied on top of your Loadout
- Save Loadout, gets pushed to game
The preset is never “active” per say, you essentially just copy/apply it to your soldier
Although this will be painful specially while playing multiplayer but something is better than nothing, isn’t is?.
There is no launch date provided for this yet and this is subject to changes so don’t hold your breath on this. What do you think about this? Should this have been a part of Battlefield 4 from the start? Let us know in the comments below(PRE.
Kris has also given some more information on her recently in relation to two other individuals during private sessions.
At that time (1997-1998) I became almost obsessed with trying to find out more. I was living in Ottawa, Canada’s capital where the Belgian Embassy is located, and in spite or repeated inquiries, they were of no help. I also contacted museums in Belgium, to no avail. My personal conclusion is that this archeological discovery would have challenged the ‘official’ roman catholic history, therefore shortly after the discovery was announced, it was not to be mentioned, in the hopes people would forget about it and it would go away. If anyone comes across any relevant information, we’d be very happy to receive your communication on this.
(Session begins at 6:15 PM.)
MARK: Hello.
KRIS: We trust that you have had so far a most promising foundation for the upcoming year and it would be to your advantage to redo the meditation that we provided Monday evening on a periodic basis over the next few weeks, simply to engrain within your unconscious pattern the desired goal. You will find it highly profitable.
MARK: Thank you. I like your choice of words there, (referring to “profitable”). I found it not only very positive but also very rewarding.
KRIS: Now, there are many issues to cover and perhaps using what you have experienced today with your group, going back over many of the conversations that we have had with you over the last year, you will see that in spite of your own sabotage, many of the things that we have mentioned and suggested have actually SEEDED the timeline so that you could be part of the project that was formulated today and we did mention to you that within three years time, one year which is already past, you will both be able to live comfortably and now in hindsight taking many of these clues that we have left over the last year you will see why you are part of today’s group. Do you understand? Does that make sense to you?
MARK: Yes it does.
KRIS: Now, many times we actually CLOAK many of the things that we say, and perhaps we only drop some of them as generalities so that Joseph does not block or interfere and that is to both of your advantages.
MARK: Yes I understand and I see how you do that.
KRIS: Now with time Joseph himself will become more secure. That is always a quality that we respect that keeps him somewhat humble.
MARK: Yes, we like him that way. Honest with good morals. Umm, work wise. Getting away from this venue that we are following, is there work for me in the near future? I have done a bunch of resumes and put stuff out there.
KRIS: Do keep in mind that you did drop off resumes and that is all that you have done. If you EXTEND yourself to actually pursue, follow-up and perhaps even to stalk them so that they know that you are in relentless pursuit. They will give and if they do not you will still find because your mental frame over the last two months has actually been more one of despondence than one of picking up the gauntlet and challenging your own limitations, rather coasting upon your own limits and without saying so bemoaning the fact that you are without. Do you understand?
So now you have an opportunity to KICK your challenges.
MARK: Now you also said about a year ago that June of this year is be a point where we can I guess start living off of the business rather than having outside employment.
KRIS: This is still a possibility but it is not that immediately you will be able to drive a Cadillac you might have to do with a PINTO. (Laughter)
It is still four wheels. Do you understand?
Things start there. Now perhaps between the second and third week of February there is the possibility, a good possibility of almost repeating the pattern from last year where you might be called upon to do some part-time work. Now here use hindsight as you HAD, the possibility of part-time employment with the phone call that you received but you did think that you were doing the right thing by putting out a higher salary and you now realize that this did not come about. Someone could have been able to offer slightly lower would have received that.
MARK: Yes but he was also not forthcoming with the information that I was trying to get out of him because I had NO idea what it would encompass. I also tried to make it clear that it was not engraved in stone. I do realize what you are saying though.
KRIS: In the future find the negotiable possibilities so that you still have something that rewards you without having to be enslaved to the work.
MARK: That is part of my problem too is that last part-time job really wanted a full-time person but only wanted to pay part-time. That is one of the reasons that I made that quote but I also made it clear to them that I was open (to negotiations).
KRIS: A good idea when you do receive such calls, do not be satisfied with just throwing an offer upon them and waiting for the phone to ring back. Take the name, number and all the necessary coordinates and pursue them. That way you will find negotiations still available.
MARK: Yes. I hate when they ask that LOADED question. You don’t want to screw yourself but you don’t want to screw them either.
KRIS: At the same time they do not necessarily know how to ask or seek what it is that they need. You have the experience so you can then perhaps, in a round about fashion, let them know what it is that they are looking for and what they NEED to ask.
MARK: So do you see on the horizon though, outside the film industry, in the near future, possibilities of what you just said that if I go out and start hounding them?
KRIS: We have suggested that by mid February you will get a phone call. That one may prove productive and at the same time the majority of people set their sights upon one particular employment venue and then they stay there. Our suggestion especially in your case, that whilst you have some part-time or perhaps full part-time work, that you do not mentally lock yourself into that pattern but keep yourself available for other opportunities such as the opportunity presented to you by the group this afternoon.
MARK: Getting into some other questions, what about Joseph’s question. You know the one I mean? The Irish Bishop female Saint found in Belgium?
KRIS: Indeed. (Long pause) There is not much information historically available because many of the Irish Catholic Church’s records were both confiscated and burnt by the Vatican. The individual in question died at approximately 48 years of age, give or take a few. She had, unlike many European women received a solid education in both academic and spiritual teachings in her own country of origin, which is Ireland. (Note that Kris says Ireland with an Irish accent).
She entered the female monastic lifestyle early approximately 8 years of age. Eight or nine years of age, being trained in the teachings of the early Irish Church, which could easily have been considered Coptic Church, meaning not quite Orthodox. She travelled to the European mainland via England. By the time she was approximately twenty-seven / twenty-eight years of age, she had endured many hardships on the European Continent.
Contrary to the Roman Church’s dictates, many women in the Irish Church were eligible for the title of Priest or Priestess. Much of the early roots of the Irish Church had successfully incorporated what is often referred to as Pagan rituals and Paganism into an orderly fashion adding to the base of information of the whole community and to its benefit, whereas the Roman Church found if they could not bend the ways of the individuals they would simply eliminate the individual.
MARK: It was to the Church’s benefit and not the citizen’s?
KRIS: The Irish Church however found many ways to enhance both themselves and the individuals which MEANT that to the Roman Church there was the HIGH likelihood of infiltrations and heretical values, propagating to pollute the so-called one true faith. Do you understand?
This individual later referred to as Saint Chrodora.
MARK: how do you spell that?
KRIS: We believe it is spelled CHRODORA. We believe that her original first name was Clarissa and as she moved up the ranks she was given a more appropriate name befitting her station. (Pause), we believe she was known both for her kindness and the sagacity of her words, sagacity meaning that she was wise. Now Joseph’s impressions were initially confusing, but we hope that he had gotten the proper re-direction concerning this lifetime. That indeed it WAS one of our lifetimes.
MARK: That it wasn’t. Where was the fascination drawn from? (Note my misunderstanding of what was actually said.)
KRIS: A deep recognition, this may have had something to do with him even indirectly. So, we tend to keep many of our lives at least to some degree in close proximity and he DID encounter us in that lifetime as a novice in the old sect by this late Saint.
MARK: Was Philip there too?
KRIS: You were employed in the grounds, in the gardens.
MARK: Oh sure, I’m the gardener!
KRIS: You were not merely a gardener but also a herbalist, which also meant that you were wise in the ways of the herbs, which in those times was also seen as the Doctor.
MARK: And Joseph was a novice?
KRIS: Indeed, a young novice.
MARK: This brings a couple other questions to mind? You said that you started contacting Joseph in the seventies. When did you start contacting me?
KRIS: We could say approximately the same time, more than from behind the scenes. Perhaps tweaking some of your intuitions or those often-profound thoughts that would flash through your mind but not having much reference for them you would often forget them almost immediately. Do you understand?
So we simply tried to keep an eye out and when it was appropriate, perhaps nudge you here and there, help direct your thoughts so that eventually you would pursue the path that you had desired from before this lifetime.
MARK: Do you have any plans to incarnate again?
KRIS: Not in YOUR terms.
MARK: Not as a human, in other words.
KRIS: Not in YOUR terms.
MARK: Does Joseph?
KRIS: Now in a way Joseph is one of our incarnations but that is as far as it goes. We will not take on more energy to invest in a particular form in physical reality. This venue is more suitable now to what is needed.
MARK: Okay. Here is a loaded question. Science fiction has people travelling in time. Is it realistic to say that a person in a conscious state can travel and participate in another time?
KRIS: But you already do. When you close your eyes and imagine another lifetime you become absorbed in the details. You ARE indeed travelling to that particular experience if not even CREATING it. That is also valid travel through time and space.
MARK: But in the physical, can such a machine be built or even using the mind can we transport in the physical?
KRIS: Again you already do that. Understand more clearly your definition of physical. Right now if you close your eyes and you see Diamond Cove off of Waikiki Beach in Honolulu and you see the gentle waves lapping at the white sand beach, you see the tall Diamond Cove Mountain in the backdrop, you see the tall palm trees, you see perhaps a freighter off the horizon, you see in the distance surfers, people on their yachts, you see on the other side of the beach the tall hotels and the cityscape. You are able to smell and literally taste the salt air and the gentle warm breeze off the ocean brushing against the hairs on your body, rapping you in an envelope of salty warmth, feeling the warm Pacific waters on your toes, lapping at your ankles at the beach side. You feel the heat of the sun rise and reflect off of the sand. Then you are in another place. Do you understand?
MARK: Yes.
KRIS: Though a portion of your consciousness is still fixed here another portion of your consciousness has just gone there. Now, you can actually modify the time that you have gone there by using the same methodology. Do you understand?
MARK: Yes I do. (I say something about the 1950’s that I can’t quite discern).
KRIS: Perhaps the time of the voyage of Captain Cook or perhaps you will go further back in time when native Hawaiian aboriginals travelled in their catamarans or their long canoes, went fishing or perhaps trading with other villages in nearby towns, before the arrival of white men. Then all it needs is your focus to SHIFT so that not only are you in another place but you could be in another place AND time simultaneously. Do you understand?
MARK: Yes I do.
KRIS: So it is a matter of shifting the focus and not the body. Basically you can not go to another time because the body is only an image in cellular form of your personality. You are projecting your own personality into January the eleventh 2003. You could and you do as easy project the same personality into January 11th, year 1710 though you might not be aware of doing so. Do you follow?
MARK: Yes I do.
KRIS: So TIME travel is also “Shift of Consciousness”.
MARK: If I can shift that consciousness can I be interacting …If I… can someone in Hawaii interact with me if I am sitting here and projecting (there)?
KRIS: In your visualization, you may speak with someone, who may or may not answer you back. You may even suggest that they WRITE you at your email address or in any other form. Now whether their conscious ego will accept the material is another matter and there are still many differentials to play with, but overall it is possible.
MARK: So I could give someone my email address and actually have someone write me?
KRIS: If that is remembered when they come to conscious awareness. You might even have someone tell a friend that they had the most bizarre experience, they thought that they heard someone but there was no one there because not all of their senses may pick you up and if they do even, not all of their conscious mind may actually accept the fact.
MARK: Okay. (Pause), something that you said before triggered a response from me. You said something to the effect that I probably would not recognize myself if I were to encounter or WHEN I encounter myself or a branch of myself that has gone off to explore a different probability.
KRIS: Indeed.
MARK: So, different probabilities intersect.
KRIS: That does occur. Not on a regular basis, and not all of your selves look the way that you do. Some of your selves may even be female.
MARK: So, let’s talk about the “Marks” that branch off into different probabilities. Do they intersect with each other?
KRIS: Sometimes, in some ways, although it is rare and again NOT all Marks look like YOU. Some have not added those extras fifteen pounds. (Laughter).
MARK: (Still laughing). Interesting!
KRIS: And some have added more.
MARK: I understand the concept that Philip is incarnated in different places of the world, at different ages, in different races and in different sexes, that concept.
KRIS: For instance, if you or a portion of you has incarnated in a Middle Eastern climate, you may not recognize that one at all, because you would have picked up the genetic material of his parents.
MARK: Yes. You explained that one of the safe guards is that I don’t know, even if I were to visit there and walk into myself. One of the other questions that I had is why are the remains from other probabilities found in THIS probability or reality?
KRIS: This is because NO SYSTEMS ARE EVER CLOSED. There is ALWAYS a free-flowing and channels of information of one type or another for the mere survival of these systems depends upon it. If any one system were completely closed off, it would suffocate without the influx of energies and without its own system giving energies to others. If a system is closed off, it will in a way, diminish.
So there are automatic energy gateways. Some are called black holes, others are called white holes and others that we call “no holes”. They are gateways to exchanges of energy, much which sustain your system just as much of your energies go elsewhere to help sustain others.
MARK: So there might be human remains in a different realm just as we have Cro-Magnon Man in ours?
KRIS: Other systems may find ancient remains that they cannot explain of a humanoid skeletal remains that had the ability to ambulate, perhaps had five digits on its hand, five digits on its foot, as opposed to those that are now living in those systems. So YOUR remains, your species remains become an anomaly, unexplainable mystery just as you have yours on this world.
There are remains of individuals who easily stood eight, nine or more feet tall. Many of these were found in the mounds of Louisiana and upper sates that have not been successfully explained because at one time on your world there were much taller individuals.
MARK: What about the “Star Child” in Nasca, the grey alien skull called the Star Child?
KRIS: We suggest that you keep that question for another time. The answers might be more elaborate than we care to go with today.
MARK: What does the Trillium Machine do? Were you the Trilliums?
KRIS: Indeed, a portion thereof. Now, this may indeed be brought up at your next business venture meeting. This machine will indeed ionize the air of a room or a house with a bigger machine. The ionization process itself will enhance the health of any living form within it, plants, animal or human. It will realign or help realign the magnetic properties in the cellular structures of the individual, thus allowing individuals the opportunity to regenerate their cellular structure in a way that brings about a stability of health. Do you understand?
MARK: Yes. Is this ionizer any different from any of the ionizers that are on the market?
KRIS: Indeed. This is not merely to CHARGE…
MARK: Particles.
KRIS: Indeed.
MARK: So at a later date we could actually get the plans for this again?
KRIS: Indeed although somewhere Joseph has those schematics. They should be dug up and if you proceed with this you may be able to produce two versions of this machinery, small for one room, larger for a house. In fact, while you are searching for your receipts, include within that search, the papers for that information.
The original plans for that machine were physically constructed but it is possible to do it with better materials instead of copper piping, copper wires which would be substantially less expensive.
MARK: I take it that the original machine is considered lost.
KRIS: Indeed NOT but it is not functioning properly.
MARK: Is it in the hands of someone who Joseph knows?
KRIS: Indeed.
MARK: Does he know it?
KRIS: Indeed. Ask him it is not a secret.
MARK: I just thought that it was given away or handed down or something.
KRIS: Indeed not.
MARK: Cool. Do some people contain more units of consciousness than others? (Pause) I am taking this of course from Star Wars and the “Metachlorian” counts.
KRIS: The question itself does not make quite some sense.
MARK: Well, if it is the smallest unit that everything is made up of, each molecule is made up of units of consciousness, wouldn’t larger people have more?
KRIS: Indeed so. Larger forms or smaller forms do not have more or less. Does a big thought and a small thought…
MARK: Ahh, it doesn’t matter. So people with a larger count don’t have any greater abilities?
KRIS: Actually the question is or rather larger forms do not have more than small forms. Units of consciousness are not comparable in that way. A large brain indeed has more cellular matter but it does not mean that the consciousness is more.
MARK: That was basically my question. I guess that is all I have for now.
KRIS: Then we will take our humble leave of you.
MARK: Thank you.
KRIS: There are many other things but they can wait. We do however reiterate our suggestion from the beginning.
MARK: Get on the phone.
KRIS: Indeed. Now with that we leave you to a most pleasant weekend.
MARK: Thank you.
(Session thought to have ended).
(After the session ends Mark starts to tell Serge about the conversations that took place, including the incorrect information about Saint Chrodora but Kris quickly comes back to set the record straight).
(7:00 PM. Session re-starts)
KRIS: If you listened correctly, we did tell you that Saint Chrodora was an incarnation of ours.
MARK: You DID say?
KRIS: Indeed.
MARK: I though that you said that it wasn’t. Oh, okay. So it WAS you?
KRIS: Indeed. It is not US as you know it but this was an incarnation of ours.
MARK: I thought that you were studying as a novice.
KRIS: Joseph was the novice and you were the herbalist healer.
MARK: Okay.
KRIS: So now that all of your selves have been properly catalogued, we will be gone.
MARK: Thank you.

He was a very positive and optimistic person who unfortunately was overcome by cancer at age 58. These losses in my life are incredibly sad, but also serve as a reminder of how important it is to address end-of-life issues.
Richard did his best to prepare his family for the worst, and in my opinion he did a very good job. However, his wife Rebecca found all the documents and planning confusing and stressful when added to the grief of losing her husband. After talking about the challenges of facing these issues, Rebecca and I decided together to share some important lessons on how to prepare, as a couple, for the loss of a spouse.
Communicate and Plan Ahead
What are your preferences for hospital treatments? Would you or your spouse want to be resuscitated in the hospital? Do you prefer to be buried or cremated? What kind of memorial service would you prefer? These are all difficult but important aspects of death that should be discussed long before they become relevant. By communicating about your respective wishes, you give each other the gift of removing doubt and uncertainty from at least one aspect of the grieving process.
Moreover, wherever it makes sense, put your wishes in writing. Whether it’s a Do Not Resuscitate (DNR) directive, a will outlining preferences for burial, or an update to your preferred account beneficiaries, putting it all in writing and ensuring these documents are legally valid will reduce tension around these decisions. One unexpected but common occurrence after the death of a loved one is dispute about what his or her wishes really were, which is often fueled by grief and shock; by making your wishes clear ahead of time you can also go a long way towards alleviating family conflict.
Know Your Business as a Couple
Even if one member of the couple takes primary responsibility for financial planning, you should both be fully apprised of everything that is going on in your financial lives. The easiest way to do this is to check in regularly about your plans. Still better, start and regularly update a list of your financial details, including bank accounts, safety deposit boxes, investment accounts, insurance policies, pensions and other retirement accounts, and Social Security benefits. You should also make a list with the contact information of advisors such as financial advisors, insurance brokers, lawyers, and accountants. Keep your files organized so that your loved ones can easily find out about any outstanding debts and keep track of loose items like stock certificates.
Both you and your spouse should also at least be aware of the basic steps that would need to be taken to transfer accounts and claim benefits in the event of a death. Even just having an idea about the procedure will go a long way towards reducing the confusion that can come with all the paperwork.
Keep this information alongside your personal documents, such as health directives, wills and trusts, and directives pertaining to burial and memorial services. The surviving spouse will inevitably have a lot to do, and grief can make even the simplest tasks so much harder. Having all the information in one place will help. For more information about financial planning after the loss of a spouse, please read Organizing Your Finances After the Loss of a Spouse.
Also keep in mind that with the loss of a spouse, the surviving spouse may see significant changes to income and lifestyle needs. Understanding your current spending and anticipating how your budget might change in the event of a death can help you plan ahead to ensure your financial security. Either way, it is a very good idea to understand your spending habits in order to effectively manage your budget. Making Sense of Your Spending Habits is a brief article with information on tackling this process and includes a spreadsheet to help get you started.
Take Care of Yourself
Be sure to take time out to take care of yourself, especially if you are currently a caregiver to your spouse. Caring for your loved one is not only physically demanding but incredibly emotionally demanding as well, and it can be hard to recognize the need to take time out to rest. Remember that without fortifying yourself, whether it be through a nap, reading a book, a hobby, exercise, or time with friends, you won’t be able to care for your beloved as effectively, so push through any feelings of guilt and remember to be good to yourself too.
Taking care of yourself is just as important in the event that your spouse passes away. Whether it’s a surprise or the result of a long-term illness, the death of a spouse is likely to affect you for years to come. Unfortunately, with the loss of a spouse there is often a lot of good advice about what to do or how to feel, but what you hear won’t necessarily be the right advice for you. Don’t feel bad about not listening to everyone, as hard as this can be during such a tumultuous time. I find that people believe they should feel or act a certain way, and that doing otherwise would be wrong, but in reality you have to do what’s right for you based on your individual feelings. This is a critical part of caring for yourself during such a difficult time.
Seek Help and Advice
It’s important to know that you can turn to friends, family, and your advisors and that they will be there to help during the worst of times. Don’t be afraid to let your loved ones help out, and don’t be afraid to ask for help; don’t feel embarrassed that you’re not completely educated on everything that’s going on.
Having a professional advisor to turn to can also help to reduce the stress and uncertainty around the financial planning required after a death. Whether it’s by moving accounts, quarterbacking other professional advisors, or providing an empathetic sounding board for your fears and questions, a good advisor will provide you with logistical and compassionate support that isn’t just limited to financial advice. However, remember that the best time to ask for advice is before you need it: Get familiar with your advisor ahead of time and take the time now to tackle these important questions and issues. If your spouse primarily deals with your advisors, make sure you get to know them a bit too so that you feel comfortable turning to one or all of them in a time of need.
Conclusions
While it’s often hard to broach the subject, communicating openly with your spouse about your respective preferences, planning ahead, and keeping each other informed are a vital part of helping each other in the event of a death. As Rebecca described it to me after the loss of her husband, it is such a vulnerable time in her life. If you can communicate and plan ahead you’ll be better positioned to get through the process.
This article is dedicated to the memory of my good friend Richard. Thank you to Rebecca for sharing her thoughts and advice for this article.

All fields are requiredIf you’re being made redundant from your job then – depending on how long you have worked for your employer – you will be entitled to certain payments from the business that you work for. In this article Employment Law Solicitor Chris Hadrill explores what nature of redundancy payments you should expect if you’re being made redundant.
Broadly speaking, the nature of the payments that you can expect in your redundancy severance package can be split into three different types:
- Contractual payments
- Statutory payments
- Ex-gratia payments
Contractual payments
Contractual payments are – as you’d expect – what you are contractually entitled to. There are a number of types of contractual payment which you could be entitled to upon termination of your employment:
- Your notice pay (if you’re being paid in lieu of notice instead of working this it may be referred to as “Pay In Lieu of Notice” or “PILON”) – this will include your wages as well as other contractual entitlements (such as any car allowance, medical benefits etc.) during the notice period
- Your accrued but untaken holiday pay
- Any bonus that you are contractually entitled to
- Any commission you are contractually entitled to
- Any contractual redundancy pay (sometimes referred to as “Enhanced Redundancy Pay” or “ERP”)
In order to determine what contractual payments you’re owed you should review the following (if applicable):
- Your contract of employment
- Any addendums or updates to your contract of employment
- Your staff handbook or other similar policies
- Any correspondence or documents detailing what the terms of your contract are
- Any collective agreement that you’re party to
Statutory payments
In a redundancy situation, you will be entitled to a statutory redundancy payment (or “SRP”) if you have worked for two years or more with your employer. Statutory redundancy pay is calculated using a particular formula based on the number of years (full) service that you have served, your age, and your gross weekly wage. For example, if you are 52, have worked for seven years for your employer, and earned a gross weekly wage of £430 then you would be entitled to the following statutory redundancy payment: £4,515 (1.5 * 7 * £430).
However, although you are statutorily entitled to a redundancy payment if you have two or more years of service with your employer, you may lose your right to a statutory redundancy payment if you unreasonably refuse an offer of suitable alternative employment.
Ex-gratia payments
Ex-gratia payments are discretionary and are generally paid as compensation for the manner of the termination of your contract of employment and, therefore, as a ‘settlement payment’ for any potential or existing claims that you could bring in the Employment Tribunal. For example, if your employer has dismissed you for redundancy but hasn’t undertaken a consultation period, considered any suitable alternative employment for you, or allowed you to appeal against you dismissal (among other things) then your dismissal may be unfair (and you may therefore choose to bring a claim for statutory unfair dismissal). You would – in this situation – be in a position to negotiate an ex-gratia payment with your employer which reflected the strength of your potential claims and the reasonable value of those claims.
So what value redundancy severance package should I expect?
Unfortunately, there’s not a simple answer to this question – the nature and value of the payments that would be reasonable in your situation will completely depend upon the facts that are specific to your situation. However, here are a number of tips for you if you’re going through a redundancy process:
- Check what your notice period is and what estimate what value of payment you should expect (i.e. if you are paid £500 gross per week with no other benefits payable and have a notice period of 4 weeks then you should expect a payment of £2,000 gross in respect of your notice)
- Check how many days accrued but untaken holiday you will have as of the date of the termination of your employment
- Check whether you’re entitled to and what value of statutory redundancy pay you should expect (handy tip: use the Direct.Gov website calculator to work this out)
- Get some legal advice from a specialist employment solicitor – you may think we would say this but if you’re being offered a settlement agreement by your employer then a) your employer has a statutory obligation to inform you to obtain legal advice from an independent adviser, and b) your employer will normally pay the majority – if not the whole – of your fees for doing so, so there’s no harm in making enquiries!

Sapiqua Iman: “I was in the middle of the show, running around like crazy, but celebrations like this are so important in Seattle. I was willing to drop everything I was doing if I could take 10 or 15 minutes, or even longer to enjoy the celebration, but there’s not a lot of opportunity for black excellence to convene, especially not in the Central District anymore. The fact that it’s here makes it even more important and more of a reason why I had to be a part of it. I’m really involved in making sure we keep cultural institutions open and art accessible, especially for producers and directors and performers. Every opportunity, every building that’s going to allow me to come in and bring some folks with me to let them know, we still here, and we’re doing some brilliant work, I’m going to do it.”
Kibibi Monie: “It marks the day when my ancestors were set free from slavery, that’s why it’s important to me. It seems to me that it still hasn’t taken root like it should. There’s still too much injustice to indigenous Americans and how the blacks in this country have been treated. With the respect and honor that we should have. It’s taken on another form of slavery because we’re still not free.”
Sheree Seretse: “It’s a recognition of what we’ve gone through together, relative freedom that we have as a people. I do say relative because we are still subjected to some things that inhibit our freedom. Here in the Northwest, there have been years when this event was well populated. It’s sad that DeCharlene passed away and not here to further her cause. She was a fighter and regardless if it was 10 people, 2 people, or 250 people she was here advocating for the community which is what Juneteenth is about.”
Gary Hammond: “Now I can say I’ve played for my community and shared who I am with them. It’s a very good feeling to be able to do that. We have a long way to go as people. We’ve got to learn to love each other again. We’ve got to understand that our music is not only rap music. We have a tradition, an art form that was created here on this soil, that’s not European. We tend to take it for granted. Juneteenth is a time for us to get together and celebrate a wonderful woman who decided to extend herself and go above and beyond to bring community together. That was DeCharlene. It must go on.”
Tony Benton of Rainier Avenue Radio: “It’s part of our history. Even though there was the Emancipation Proclamation, there were still parts of our country where people were not free. As Americans, we have to remember the resilience that took place when these people were freed. Once the word came, there was a celebration that took place, this was 2 years after the Emancipation Proclamation. Can you imagine what you would do in that situation? First think about being a slave and what that bondage did to mentally, physically. Then, you don’t know where you’re going, what you’re doing, you don’t know what freedom is. They took time to celebrate freedom and each other. There are a lot of different reasons to celebrate, freedom is one of them. Part of it is how to do we move forward in a country that has enslaved us. There are a lot of things to reflect on. At the end of the day, it’s another part of American history. Today is a celebration of DeCharlene. Whether it will happen next year, I don’t know. It will take a group of people coming together and say we are going to continue to celebrate this day in her legacy and that’s what Juneteenth is about.”
Jazmyn Scott, Program Manager for Langston, the new non-profit at Langston Hughes: “As part of the programing goals at Langston is to make sure we are engaging the community in things around African American arts and culture. DeCharlene Williams who recently passed, who was the founder of the Central Area Chamber of Commerce started doing this Juneteenth celebration 35 years ago at this park. It’s a traditional thing to make sure to get the community to come out and get information, to fellowship, to get to know one another. We wanted to make sure that as a community partner that we weren’t doing anything that was going against anything that was already happening in the community. But see how we could partner with and be a part of to make sure those legacies would continue. It became important for us to come together and partner with the Central Area Chamber of Commerce to make sure this event still happened even though she’s no longer at the helm. It’s us, the Northwest African American Museum, The Central District Forum for Arts and Ideas, were the main partners who came together to put the celebration on. There’s also Black Dot and Africatown, Rainier Avenue Radio, there were a lot of community members who wanted to make sure this happened. Legacies shouldn’t die when the body leaves.”
The full proclamation is below. The statement also recognizes the role the Central Area Chamber of Commerce has played in the region’s annual celebration of Juneteenth. DeCharlene Williams, the founder and longtime head of the chamber, died in May at the age of 75.
Over the weekend, two days of Juneteenth celebrations were held around the Langston Hughes Performing Arts Institute and Pratt Park in the Central District:
2018 marks the 35th annual event presented by The Central Area Chamber of Commerce and the first year without DeCharlene Williams at the helm. This year, we will honor and continue her lifelong legacy of supporting and empowering Black community and business.
RainierAvenueRadio.World will air a recap of the 35th Annual Juneteenth Community Celebration at 7 PM on Tuesday June 19th.
The King County’s proclamation in recognition of Juneteenth is below:
RECOGNITION
WHEREAS, Juneteenth commemorates the day on June 19, 1865, when African slaves in Texas were told by Major General Gordon Granger that they are now “free” and that their 246 years of chattel slavery had ended; and
WHEREAS, the abolishment of slavery throughout the U.S. had actually taken place some two and a half years earlier when President Abraham Lincoln enacted the Emancipation Proclamation on January 1, 1863, but resistance to his Executive Order and continued conflict in Texas regarding the abolishment of slavery significantly delayed the freedom of slaves; and
WHEREAS, a year after Major Granger’s announcement, on June 19, 1866, the freed African American men and women in Texas held the first “Juneteenth” or African American Independence Day celebration, which would later spread to all corners of the country; and
WHEREAS, in 1979, Texas became the first state to make Juneteenth an official holiday and has been followed by 41 other states that have recognized Juneteenth as a state holiday or holiday observance; and
WHEREAS, Juneteenth is now the closest occasion for there being a true “freedom day” to celebrate in this country for people of African descent; and
WHEREAS, in King County, Juneteenth will be celebrated in people’s homes and neighborhoods, with the longest and largest celebration being held by the Central Area Chamber of Commerce;
NOW, THEREFORE, we, the Metropolitan King County Council, recognize the historic event of
JUNETEENTH
and encourage all residents of Martin Luther King, Jr. County to join us in its celebration..Export Selected webitems in BEX WAD
Hi Experts ,
I have been working on WAD to develop templates. My requirement is that i need to export the Web Report as pdf and Xls file. I have used the Javascript /command wizard to achieve this. Its working. However i need to export only selected web items. I have used 2 images and Query description( custom text) in the Header Pane web item.
My report has so many web items( filter pane, navigation pane, text fields etc..)
I need to Export the Header pane and the Analysis (table) only.
I used the Bind functionality in command Wizard and was able export the Analysis item , but i was not able to export the image since it is not a web item.I tried binding the Header Pane, but nothing seem to be get exported .
How can i achieve this? Any Idea?The Honda Military Appreciation Offer salutes your military service to our country by offering you $500 towards any 2020 or newer Honda vehicle when you finance or lease with Honda Financial Services.SM [1]

reviewing my oneclj project. actually use
lein will be much easier. anyways, at least I learned something from doing it the stupid way.
spent an afternoon to rewrite using
lein, the original
mvn approach kept in the
maven branch.
some notes:
create temparory folder, since
java 7 can use
(def temp-dir (java.nio.file.Files/createTempDirectory "prefix-string" (into-array java.nio.file.attribute.FileAttribute [])))
even though the 2nd argument for
createTempDirectory is optional in java, but not in clojure.
for java methods with varargs, you need at least pass an empty array to it in clojure.
after created the temparory folder, use
deleteOnexit to let it removes itself.
(.deleteOnExit (.toFile temp-dir))
the folder won't delete itself if there's files in it, so also need to clean up the folder first or use
createTempFile with
deleteOnexit.
for
uberjar, if you don't want to put temparory files in
src folder. can create those files in a temp folder (see above) and add
:source-paths ["/tmp/temp-dir"] to
project.clj.
doesn't matter where you put your clj files, they will be packed to the root level inside the jar.

reading a blog post by cloudflare from a week ago: Why we use the Linux kernel's TCP stack
it is the kind of article that throws you too much information if you are not in that domain:
- Time-sharing
- IRQ storm
- netmap - the fast packet I/O framework
- what they mean With this the kernel retains the ownership of the network card, and allows us to perform a bypass only on a single "RX queue": Single RX queue kernel bypass in Netmap for high packet rate networking
- about RFC4821 PMTU discovery, the RFC, the blog post: Path MTU discovery in practice and discussion on hacker news
- also the original post by Julia Evans: Why do we use the Linux kernel's TCP stack?
- and discussion on hacker news: Why do we use the Linux kernel's TCP stack? | Hacker News
since I'm learning network programming now, might worth spending time go through clouldflare's blog posts, especially Marek Majkowski's.
read another Julia Evans blog post: One way to make containers network: BGP, it is not that great.
but Julia Evans is a good learner. she probably looks amature in that topic at this moment, after weeks or months, she's way ahead of you. looking forward to her findings in the container networking area.
even though the blog post is not good, discussion on hacker news is great:
- Project Calico | A Pure Layer 3 Approach to Virtual Networking
- coreos/flannel: flannel is an etcd backed network fabric for containers
- Why Kubernetes doesn't use libnetwork
- kubernetes-the-hard-way: Bootstrap Kubernetes the hard way.

- bacwn: clojure + datalog = <3

finished an offsite test, learned few things.
reading a very large file with clojure: be lazy.
(line-seq) is lazy,
map is lazy,
filter is lazy.
partition the data,
map and
filter and
loop recur them.
to setup a Redis server, arioch/redis puppet module works well.
to import large dataset to Redis, need to use Redis Protocol (see Redis Mass Insertion).
initial import took an hour, just few minutes after changed to use redis protocol.
the task is to count things for a specific time period. using redis' sorted set data type and timestamp as score:
ZADD key timestamp value, then
ZCOUNT key from-time to-time gives you count of unique item by the range (score), and super fast.
the other task is also about counting unique things, dataset is not large I just fit them in a memory set.
but I'd been looking for a way to handle a larger dataset, HyperLogLog should be a popular algorithm for counting unique items in large dataset.
Redis also has HyperLogLog data structure, the blog post has useful links about HyperLogLog.
for standalone server, there is armon/hlld: C network daemon for HyperLogLogs
they have another interesting project: armon/bloomd: C network daemon for bloom filters
more about these two servers: Armon Dadgar on Bloom Filters and HyperLogLog
some other libraries:
- bigmlcom/sketchy: Sketching Algorithms for Clojure (bloom filter, min-hash, hyper-loglog, count-min sketch)
- addthis/stream-lib: Stream summarizer and cardinality estimator.
chart presentation is using dimple.
actually I was going to use Quil, but didn't seem to have enough time.
few interesting links:
- 500 Lines or Less is the latest book from aosa series. pdf link is here

episode 5 of defn podcast is about Hoplon, which is the framework used by one of companies I interviewed.
I paired with their developer worked on a simple frontend task, it was fun and I definitely will check out more about Hoplon.
Consider Hoplon is a good start, it modified lein reagent template for hoplon, more simple for lein users.
Some really good real-world clojure recommendations on this reddit thread: Just got my first Clojure job! Any tips for someone using it in production for the first time?

eth0 to use
bridge:
config.vm.network "public_network", auto_config: false, :bridge => "wlan0", :adapter => 1
and have to restart network on
vagrantup, add this line to
/etc/rc.local before
exit 0:
ifdown eth0 && ifup eth0
I did my tech news page about 3 years ago, still running node.js and java.
it's time to rewrite it because I probably don't know how to code node.js now. and it's something I can practice hoplon with.

The Blue Yeti
As someone who had the privilege of working on some iconic microphones (including the industry standard ElectroVoice RE20), I still amazed by the sound quality of this offering from Blue. Some audiophile will likely leave a comment explaining why
As someone who had the privilege of working on some iconic microphones (including the industry standard ElectroVoice RE20), I still amazed by the sound quality of this offering from Blue. Some audiophile will likely leave a comment explaining why
The Yeti is actually three microphones in one. With three onboard condenser capsules, you can select the pickup pattern. That means you can set it to only record the sound coming from directly in front (great for one voice), the sound coming from the front and back (great for interviews), or the sound for all directions (great for recording music or multiple voices.)
One of my favorite features is the built in 3.5mm headphone jack. This allows you to plug in headphones and monitor your audio in real time without any delay often found with recording software.
Check out the sound. In each of these I am providing one version with raw audio (no processing added) and another version with some compression added in Adobe Premiere.
Blue Yeti – Blackout Edition – $107.99 (amazon.com)
The Blue Snowball
I still can’t believe that you can pick one of these up for around $50. I also see them at pawn shops for half that. While it doesn’t have quite the depth and clarity of the Blue Yeti, honestly, most people will never know the difference. This sits on my desk and I use it constantly for video conferences, YouTube videos, and quick voiceovers. It is also super portable so it goes in my bag when I am on the road.
It lacks the multiple pickup patterns of the Yeti as well as the 3.5mm headphone jack. However, if you don’t need those features, this is a great mic. If you are just starting your own podcast, this is a great place to start.
Take a listen to the audio demo. See if you can see the difference.
The Blue Snowball Ice $49 (amazon.com)
The CAD GXL2400 USB Microphone
My son got this microphone for his YouTube channel, gaming, video chats, and whatever else he needs audio for. It has a ton of 5-star reviews on Amazon so I thought I would test it out. I have to to admit, for another $50 microphone, it sounds pretty amazing. It looks like a far more expensive mic and, surprisingly, I believe it outperformed by Blue Snowball. Give it a listen for yourself.

These microphones sound great and are one of the most durable mics on the market. In my radio days, we used them for anything that was recorded or broadcast outside our studios. I have dropped more SM58s than I care to count and, when I picked them up, they sounded exactly the same. These are used by pros every day, and it is astounding that you can pick one up for $100.

“The liturgy is the place where we wait for Jesus to show up. We don't have to do much. The liturgy is not an act of will. It is not a series of activities designed to attain a spiritual mental state. We do not have to apply will pressure. To be sure, like basketball or football, it is something that requires a lot of practice
its rhythms do not come naturally except to those who have been rehearsing them for years. On some Sundays the soul will indeed battle to even pay attention. In the normal course of worship, we do not have to conjure up feelings or a devotional mood; we are not required to perform the liturgy flawlessly. Such anxious effort ... blind us to what is really going on.
We do have to show up, and we cannot leave early. But if we will dwell there, remain in place, wait patiently, Jesus will show up.”

It addresses the issue of why godless people often prosper. It shows that it really is better to stay loyal to the Lord-a loyalty expressed in contentment, honesty, and generosity. In his own good time, the Lord will make a clear distinction between the godless and the faithful. Meanwhile, the faithful must wait patiently.”

“To illustrate the marked atmospheric contrast between the two cities, the writer Frank Carpenter observed that in New York, "a streetcar will not wait for you if you are not just at its stopping point. It goes on and you must stand there until the next car comes along. In Washington people a block away signal the cars by waving their hands or their umbrellas. Then they walk to the car at a leisurely pace, while the drivers wait patiently and the horses rest." While the capital might lack "the spirit of intense energy" that animated New York, Carpenter concluded that Washington, with its broad, clean streets and fine marble buildings (and its shanties generally hidden from view), offered "the pleasanter place in which to live.”
— Doris Kearns Goodwin
“Only in the classroom of silence can we gain the calm and clarity that allow us to know when to wait patiently and when to push forward impatiently, when to plan diligently and when to live spontaneously. It is in the quiet of our own hearts that we learn how to calmly manage the present and passionately create the future. It is this calmness and clarity that will allow us to realize what we are called to and what matters most. Finding our place in the world and beginning to fulfill our mission is then nothing more than a matter of time. A man or woman who takes time in quiet reflection sincerely seeking to find his or her place in the world will not be ignored. First will come the inner calm, then will come the desire to serve, and then will come a wonderful clarity of purpose. Guided by that calm and clarity, we begin to affect what we can affect, and only then do we truly begin to have an effect.”

As marketers, we are all becoming more familiar with personalization as we recognize the need to tailor digital experiences to individual users. Only we are doing it all wrong. OK, partly wrong.
In this blog post, I explore the concept of ‘true personalization:’ tailoring the digital experience to the kind of relationship someone wants with your organization.
Rather than just customizing a digital experience according to what someone has clicked on, true personalization posits that the type of content someone consumes is far more important to building long-lasting and deep relationships.
Personalization isn’t what you think it is
What’s the first thing you think of when someone says the term ‘personalization?’ Is it your name inside the label of your sweatshirt, like your mom used to write? Or is it the technology that makes a website seem like it’s meant just for you?
Well, this blog post isn’t going to talk about the first kind, sorry. Perhaps what I meant to ask was “what do you think of when someone says personalization technology?”
If you are a marketer, chances are you’re quite familiar with technologies like Marketo and Eloqua. But the point I want to make is that true personalization isn’t just about tailoring the digital experience to how a user behaves.
Sure, that’s important. It’s just that it’s more than that. It’s really about tailoring the digital experience to match the kind of relationship that a user wants with your organization.
It’s all about relationships
Let’s get this out of the way first. Whenever you touch a member of your audience, be they prospect or customer, you form a relationship. That relationship can be positive, it can be negative. It can be strong, it can be weak. It can be fleeting, it can be long-lasting. But you’ve formed a relationship anyway.
In the book I recently co-authored, Recommend This! Delivering Digital Experiences that People Want to Share (Wiley, 2014), we identified nine characteristics of a relationship.
One of those characteristics is history. If we have a history, we have a relationship. And when your audience engages with you, be it in the aisles of a store or through a piece of digital content, history has been established (along with a bunch of other elements we won’t go into it).
That’s why doing business is all about relationships. And really successful businesses, like Apple, understand that.
People want different relationships from an organization
Not everyone wants to watch a video or read a long piece of content or even look at pictures. Some people may just want some bullet points or to hear more from actual customers.
That’s because the kinds of content that an audience consumers reflects the kind of relationship that they want.
Consider the following illustration that captures four basic relationship types. Each type has a different kind of engagement style. One wants to be left alone while another wants as much attention from you as possible.
Of course, these types are not inclusive. There can be other relationship types and other names. But this is an attempt to demonstrate that not everyone wants to interact with you in the same way.
What’s important to understand, though, is that people change their relationship type like they change their socks. One moment they want nothing to do with you and the next they want to be your best friend.
How content type reflects relationship need
Of course, there is no hard and fast rule to this but generally speaking, a deeper relationship type is far more likely to spend time with your content than someone who just “wants the facts.”
So in mapping the relationship types that we outline above to different content formats, you might come out with something like this:
- You don’t see me. Wants bullet points and datasheets on the website; self-service information that is short and to the point; they might watch an occasional video…or maybe just the first 10 seconds.
- Acknowledge. Still wants the bullet points and datasheets but might like to see what you are doing on Facebook; may even ‘like’ a post; is much more willing to read a case study or watch your video.
- Attention hound. They love those blog posts, the content that may have nothing to do with your product and everything to do about you; they are active on Facebook and eager to click and share posts/links against which they can comment some more. Video is definitely a go, especially when they can discuss it.
- BFF. You wrote an e-book? Okay, I’ll read it. These people believe in your company. They are part of the tribe and will commit the extra time to read and engage with long-form or video content.
How personalization fails today
The problem isn’t that digital experiences aren’t being personalized (well, let’s face it, some aren’t’), it’s that they aren’t taking into consideration all of the data elements that should be used to implement a personalized experience.
When our audience members are looking at a specific product, we ‘personalize’ the experience by giving them all of that product content. We don’t stop to think that they were more interested in the bullet points than the video (or vice-versa).
It’s not that personalization carried out in that fashion is wrong. It’s just that it’s missing a major component, how the audience wants to engage with your organization.
Can this be solved with technology?
It’s very possible that personalization and targeting software can evolve to meet this concept of personalizing based on relationship need.
Perhaps by tagging specific content elements within a digital experience according to content type and then using content type and click behavior to start offering specific content types (perhaps even by product) to users (rather than just more of the same content subject matter), we can get closer to true personalization.
What personalization gets you (when you do it right)
Let’s do a little thought experiment. Each time you engage with your digital audience (remember, we’ve established already that you form a relationship), it’s called a transaction. And each transaction has a positive, neutral, or negative outcome.
If the ultimate goal of business is to form deep and lasting relationships with customers (because they tend to spend more and tell their friends about how awesome you are) then the bulk of those transactions have to be positive. And how do you make them positive? Simple, by giving people what they want.
You see where this is going, right? By personalizing the digital experience not only against how a user behaves but by what kind of content they have been consuming, you create the opportunity for more positive transactions.
You give them what they want…how they want it. That’s powerful.
Solving the problem today
Perhaps the technology exists today to solve this but it doesn’t really matter if it does because organizations still need to understand that personalization isn’t just about shifting menus and offering different pages of content.
It’s about serving up the kind of content that the user wants and that requires a mind-shift, not just a feature in some software suite.
But once that shift has been made, when an organization recognizes that personalization is all about cultivating relationships, they can produce all types of different content formats for all of their products.
That way, even if they can’t utilize technology to deliver exactly the right content to the right kind of relationship type, they can at least have content available that appeals to every kind of relationship. And that is a step closer to true personalization.

With the Fourth of July excitement well behind us, we may be quick to find excuses to stay inside and relax in the cool A/C comfort of our homes. And of course there’s nothing wrong with that, it’s important for our bodies to decompress and recharge, but in the same breath, it is also equally important to make sure the body is getting the exercise it needs and deserves after staring at technology screens for days on end.
From the high mountain ranges to the cool coastlines of the Salish Sea, the Pacific Northwest is a nature wonderland, filled with breathtaking views and landscapes. The summer season is the perfect time to take a social media break and experience the great outdoors, to disconnect from the world and reconnect with Mother Earth, if you will.
Tulalip community member and SNAP-Ed Nutritionist, AnneCherise Jensen, set aside some time to share a few ideas on how local citizens can take advantage of the long summer days, get outdoors and have a little fun in the sun.
Okay, first things first. Why is exercise important for our bodies?
Exercise is the best form of preventive medicine. Our bodies are like a machine, if you don’t use it, you lose it. We need to be moving our bodies and pushing them to their fullest potential in order to keep our bodies healthy. The reason why exercise is important is because it helps take care of our organs – our heart, our lungs, our kidneys. Physical activity is medicine for the body, it helps repair itself. The more sedentary we get, the weaker our organs get. The more exercise we get, the more we’re strengthening our body, and the more resilient we’re making it to outward things that are coming inside. It helps relieve a lot of the toxins that we’re exposed to in today’s environment. The biggest reason exercise is so important is because it reduces the risk of diabetes, certain types of cancers, obesity and heart disease.
It’s summertime! The warm weather presents a great opportunity for outdoor recreation, what are some fun activity ideas the community can do before the summer ends?
One thing that I love to do is go on small little hikes throughout the summer. We live in a really nice area where we have local access to trails. There’s lots of really good ones out in Mountain Loop Highway like Coal Lake, Lake 22, Heather Lake, Mt. Pilchuck. Those are really good trails, moderate to beginner ones.
Riding bikes is awesome if you have access to fun and safe roads, same with going to the skate park. Also, going to the beach for a swim. Swimming is a really great way to exercise, burn calories, keep your cardio up and it’s real forgiving on your joints. That’s a pretty good start. If you’re feeling like you’re not very flexible or have a lot of pain, I recommend yoga or chair yoga.
For those who are interested in hiking but have never been, what type of gear is needed before retreating to the mountains?
A good pair of hiking shoes. You’re going to want something that is water resistant and has a good sole. I recommend Salomon/Arc’Teryx at the outlet mall, they have really good prices on shoes. Also Columbia, and REI is a really good place to go if you’re in the Lynnwood area. Always make sure you have your ten essentials and those include matches, water, a compass, map, food, an emergency blanket (see image for complete list). You always want to make sure you have a rain jacket when you’re up in the mountains. You never know what the weather is going to be, so you want to make sure you have a waterproof jacket that provides warmth. Always know where you’re going, read a trip report. A good source to get information like that is the Washington Trails Association at
Hiking and camping often go hand-in-hand and camping is a great summertime group activity, any advice for first time campers?
There are two ways to camp; you can park and have all your gear out and camp close to your car, or you can go overnight backpacking where you pack all your overnight gear. That’s a really great experience, probably my number one favorite thing to do in the summertime is to go camping in the mountains. You want to have dehydrated food, lots of water and a water purifier so you have a clean water source. The experience is a good way to disconnect and get in tune with yourself, especially if you’re a spiritual person.
You always want to make sure you know where you’re camping and do a little research beforehand. Make sure that you set up in a designated camping spot and that you have enough food to secure you at least one day extra than you planned.
Canoe Journey is happening now and is extremely popular amongst tribal nations, what are a few tips for the canoe pullers?
When you’re out on the water, make sure you bring lots of water that have electrolytes, because a lot of time you’re in the blazing sun and sweating a lot and in order to retain the water you drink, you want to have enough sodium, potassium, magnesium, so that way you don’t get fatigued.
More important than anything, wherever you’re going, the mountains or the water, make sure you’re with a group of safe people, people you can trust and rely on. And also, follow the LNT principals, Leave No Trace, respect the outdoors and make sure you leave it better than you found it.
What are some fun ideas for folks who want to enjoy the sun in the comfort of our community?
One of my favorite things to do in the area, if you can get a fun group together, is to go on a trash cleanup. Even if you just work in your local area, community, block, or beach, grab some gloves and a couple other people and fill your bags up with trash. It’s super rewarding and fun.
If you have a dog, or even a cat, definitely walking and playing with your pet. I just got a dog this year, his name is Copper, we take him hiking in the mountains or we’ll take him to the beach. We have lots of local beach access points out here. Strawberry Fields, out in Arlington, is also a really great place to take your dog. It has a nice mile-and-a-half long trail so you’re getting some exercise yourself along with the dog.
Last but not least, I highly recommend going to the YMCA, especially if you have kids and a free membership. You can play basketball with your kids or take them swimming.
This time of year, many people can be found tending to their personal gardens and cultivating nutritious crops. Can you talk about the benefits, both physical and nutritional, there are when growing a garden?
Gardening is a great activity, even if you just have one bed. Being out with the plants helps you develop a really good relationship with the plants and food. You’re able to get some vitamin D from the sunshine and also mild physical activity, it gets you moving. Kale, potatoes and carrots are all really easy to grow and you can add those to any meal and do oven-baked vegetables.
You can also go harvesting for native plants. Harvesting is another wonderful thing to do this time of year, especially out here on the reservation. You can go out and find an area to harvest berries and you can use those to bring home and make salads or other interesting things. Everything is in season right now. I’ve noticed there’s a lot of fruit trees out here, so if you have access to a fruit tree you can gather enough to make pies, jams, desserts and fruit salads.
As you know, it’s BBQ season. Do you have any tasty recipes that people can chef up for their next cookout?
I have two recipes for BBQs! I have a strawberry mango salsa that’s yummy, you can add jalapenos, strawberries, mangos, tomatoes. You get a lot of servings of fruits and vegetables and it’s high in vitamin C too. Vitamin C is great to eat a lot of throughout the summertime, especially before the cold weather hits. You can do pico de gallo if you don’t like it with the fruit.
And fruit kabobs. We’re going to have fruit kabobs at the Tulalip Health Clinic’s annual Health Fair on July 26th. It’s a good way for kids to try new fruits that they haven’t been exposed to. Try to have ten different fruits available and you can put it on a kabob and take it with you.
Are there any upcoming events you would like to share with our readers?
If you’re looking for more things to do at Tulalip, we have our Garden Days. Our next one is going to be August 3rd at 10:00 a.m. We always start each Garden Day with a mile-and-a-half walk. And we also have our walking club every Wednesday at noon at the Health Clinic, it’s always fun to get out there and go for a walk by the bay.

Content created and supplied by: TrizahKThere are many different types of psychic ability and are used in many different psychic readings. Some of the most common types of psychic ability are clairvoyance and precognition. Clairvoyance is “clear seeing.” A clairvoyant has the ability to perceive past, present, or future events without conscious knowledge. Precognition is the ability to know the future.
Some people have telepathy, the ability to read the thoughts of others, or empathy, the ability to sense emotions. There are those that sense auras and those who can get impressions from objects.
Another type of psychic ability is channelling. Channelling, in its strongest form, is the ability to set oneself aside and let a non-physical being come through. A weaker and more common form of channelling is the ability to sense or communicate with such beings. A specialized form of channelling is mediumship, or the ability to sense or communicate with those who have gone to the Other Side.
While not technically a form of extra-sensory perception, there are people with telekinesis, or the ability to move objects from one place to another without physical means.
Most people have some psychic ability, and it can be a gift. On the other hand, unacknowledged or uncontrolled psychic ability can also be a source of difficulty. There are ways to learn to develop and control these abilities.Natural Muscle Spasm Relief

To be an astute investor you need to be knowledgeable about some basic concepts. In this posting I discuss some critical concepts that will prove beneficial.
Risk- is the uncertainty of an investment’s return. It is critical to appreciate that in the world of investments there is a certain element of risk that you may lose the investment or you may not get good returns. Risks are reduced by be knowledgeable and realistic in your assessment of the risks involved. One can take steps to reduce the risks associated with each investments class. Not every investment carries the same level of risk. Savings have guaranteed return and no risk. Stocks carry risks because they fluctuate.
Volatility- is the degree to which the value of an investment tends to fluctuate over time. For example stock prices can move up and down on a daily basis whereas a real estate investment is not as volatile on a regular basis. Volatile investments are not wise for a temperamental person. When it comes to volatility, one should realize, that the fluctuations may be just phantom increases or decreases as the real value is obtainable at harvest of the investment. So the longer the investment horizon the less perturbed and investor is with volatility.
To a certain extent it could be said: The higher the risk of investment, the higher the volatility and the higher the potential returns
Risk tolerance- is the amount of risk that you are personally comfortable accepting in your investments. It is affected by your time horizon and your personal response to risk. Time horizon- is the amount of time you have before you need the invested money back. The greater the time horizon the greater your risk tolerance as short term changes in investment performance does not affect you.
- How you personally feel about taking risks and losing money- personal response to risk.
- Do you avoid risk at all costs? Avoid high risk investments e.g. stocks
- If you enjoy risks- go for growth investments- those that increase in value overtime.
Investment portfolio- is a collection of various types of investments that you hold. For example real estate, listed stocks, unlisted shares, businesses owned, passive income through Intellectual property. Asset allocation- is the process of determining the percentage of your investment portfolio that each asset class should occupy based on your risk tolerance. Overall purpose of asset allocation is to reduce volatility, so that thriving investments in one asset class potentially outweigh losing investments in other classes. One should own various asset classes.
Diversification – is owning various investments within each asset class e.g. stocks from various industries, with the intention of decreasing risk without compromising returns over the long term. Diversification is prudent for an investor. Many budding investors are misled by seasoned investors who discourage diversification. I attended a seminar where a renowned businessman in Zimbabwe was discouraging diversification on the basis that one should be focused. However when one analyses this businessman’s investments, one discovers that he is significantly diversified as he holds equity in financial services sector, hotel and leisure, real estate as well as owning businesses that range from commodity broking, travel, estate agency etc. Similarly renowned wealth creation expert Robert Kiyosaki discourages diversification – calling it “di-worsification” —- but an assessment of his own investment portfolio does show a strongly diversified portfolio with publishing, seminars, stock exchange listed portfolios, and businesses spanning various industries form precious minerals to energy and financial services. What this teaches a novice is that be careful as people sometimes show a discrepancy between their espoused values and the values they live. One should exercise a healthy sense of skepticism when they are learning on investments or anything for that matter. Accepting anything without questioning makes one gullible.
One thought on “Investments101”
Well, you have clarified an issue that has been troubling me and that is diversification, i was just reading another article where the author stresses on the point that to be Financially successfull, you need to be divergent as opposed to convergent.Marquee Broadcasting Inc. - WMDT

She has worked in the surprisingly large building on South Main Street in Salinas for close to seven months, and in her five years as a hair stylist she has surely seen the gamut of crazy.
But Araceli has found a niche in the crazy building, between a life-size poster of Lebron James and an impressive panoramic photograph of the beautiful AT&T Park. She does any haircut a person would come in for, specializing in cutting and coloring women’s hair. She started cutting hair while she was in high school, but loved the job she had at HSBC too much to become a full-time hair stylist. Finally, in 2008, she began her career cutting hair and moved to her current spot at Makin’ the Cut in July of 2012.
Araceli’s bright and bubbly personality shows the love she has for her job and her clients. She prides herself in listening to what the client wants and then she delivers. The happiness of her clients is of utmost importance.

We've got a nice buyback in the lead-off spot too, with this excellent 1989 Bip Roberts. Bip is a popular guy among card bloggers, and looked absolutely overjoyed in this photograph. I'd love to add this one to the binder, but there's just one problem. Because Bip didn't play in the Majors at all in 1987, and appeared in only five games in 1988, he wasn't featured in the 1989 Topps flagship set. This one's from the '89 Traded set, which means...
1988 Topps #339 - Kurt Stillwell
I can't say that Kurt Stillwell excites me all that much. I really don't have any memories of this guy from my period of childhood fandom in the early '90s. This is a 1988 Topps buyback though, and 1988 was the only time Kurt would be selected as an All-Star, so it has that going for it I suppose.
1987 Topps #786 - Jimy Williams
This one's a pretty big coincidence. I grabbed the six buybacks we're reviewing today at random from my backlogged stash, and it's funny that I pulled Jimy Williams' 1987 release. In my last franken-set post only three days ago, Jimy's 1988 Topps buyback (sent to me by Gavin of Baseball Card Breakdown) got rejected. Well, there is some justice in the world, because this '87 is my first #786 buyback, so Jimy makes the binder after all! A nice high number too, in fact Williams resides on the final page of the set.
1993 Topps #455 - Chili Davis
Ah, 1993 Topps. I have memories of buying jumbo packs of this at the Little League field after our team's games that summer. As for this card, Chili Davis didn't actually play with the Twins in '93. The Angels signed him as a free agent in the winter of 1992. Worked out well for California; in his first season with the Angels in 1993 he drove in a career-high 112 runs!
2006 Topps #522 - Jason Isringhausen
2006 was a pretty good year for Cardinals reliever Jason Isringhausen. While he saw his own personal statistics slide a bit from his 2005 All-Star campaign numbers, he was still an integral part of the Cards' bullpen, and the team won the World Series in 2006.
1984 Topps #242 - Alex Trevino
I don't know all that much about Alex Trevino, either. He was a light-hitting catcher and third baseman who was winding down his 13-year career just as I became a fan of the game. Pictured with the Reds here, he was actually traded to the Braves early in 1984 and finished out the season with Atlanta.
One number closer to franken-set completion after today's batch. In fact, the next new number that I fill will be quite significant, as it will take me to the 80% complete mark! Until then...
Franken-set Progress: 633/792 (79%)
1990 Topps Buyback Set: 101/792 (12%)
"Rejected" Buybacks: 528
Total Buybacks in Collection: 1,262
3 comments:
I might have gone with the Trevino personally just because of the sort-of action shot. It looks like he just caught a foul pop up.
Building a Topps Traded Frankenset would be sweet. Although... Steve Sax and Pete Rose might give Bip a run for his money if you ever stumbled across their Traded buybacks.
Hope you're having a great Thanksgiving!The International Brotherhood of Teamsters Benefits Committee at United Airlines has put together this informational and resource package to assist you in understanding your benefits and to provide you with a quick-reference to help employees with Benefit questions.

Opening day for Amway Grand Plaza’s new brunch series at WolfgangI have been contemplating upon vision of present mind set
where propaganda is being done
that
neither
any enlightened “Guru” in physical form
nor
any sort of spiritual guidance are required
while traversing upon spiritual path.
It is being kept out of mind in modern age that “Guru” is a status
which is achieved through the highest level of spiritual austerities
after getting totally enlightened and attainment of ultimate bliss.
Only such highly elevated Souls are totally liberated from the shackles of birth and death cycle
and can help any individual soul in getting totally emancipated from worldly bondage.
How any such can help in getting liberated who is already still trapped in material world?
Can a blind lead a blind to show the real path?
The modern concept being launched is that “self “ is the only source of inspiration
and
the whole spiritual journey can be successfully completed in it’s radiance and guidance
without any presence of a physical totally accomplished “Guru”.
I have no intentions to highlight and support the concept of “Gurudum”
but the problem is that
do we really know and have any dictionary anywhere
to decode the language being used to communicate with “self”
and then
how to get introduced in inner realm on our own
without any help, guidance and real wisdom?
Are we really capable enough to walk the path
with the skill of decoding the metaphysical codings
and divine intuitions to communicate with the “self”
by total denial of presence of truly enlightened Guru?
Here “Guru” means really enlightened and totally accomplished sage
and
not a commercial one enjoying the materialistic lust.
I very humbly invite all my friends to kindly share their most valuable views
upon this interesting and vital issue raised in this most valuable post.
Humble Wishes.

1) Refresh Walls and Trim
To brighten up your home and increase its value, you can paint dark walls. Wallpapering one wall or a small area can add visual interest and character to your home. You might consider repainting your home or adding trim to it for a more finished, elegant look. Crown molding can be a great way to add dimension to your home and make it feel larger.
2) Get Rid Of Popcorn Ceilings
Popcorn ceilings are no longer a standard feature and can make it harder to sell your home. The spray-on texture is an old-fashioned way to hide shoddy artistry or ceiling cracks. You may also find cobwebs or dust, which can be challenging to clean. Finally, it creates shadows on your ceiling, which makes your space appear darker.
Your popcorn ceilings might contain asbestos if your home was built before 1979. It’s hazardous, and you should have the popcorn removed by a professional.
3) Insulate the Attic
Your attic may not be adequately insulated. This could lead to heat and cool air escaping from your home, which can cause your energy bills to skyrocket. Quality insulation in your attic is a great way to reduce utility bills and increase your home’s energy efficiency. This is a quick DIY project that will bring you instant results.
4) Make Your Yard Look Great
You can give your yard a makeover by planting trees and adding landscaping. Motion-detecting lights are not only beautiful but can also deter burglars, vandals, and other unwanted creatures. Another great way to improve curb appeal is to resurface your driveway.
5) Fix Your Gutters
If your gutters or downspouts look good, you can clean them thoroughly. To gently clean any buildup, you’ll need a soft bristle toothbrush and a hose. A cleaner is also necessary. You can use liquid detergent, white vinegar, or a TSP-PF (trisodium-phosphate- and phosphate-free) cleaning product.
You can also repaint your gutters after they have been dried and cleaned. You can choose to use oil-based or latex-based paint depending on the material of your channels. The first step is to remove the old paint. Next, sand the gutters down gently, apply primer and then paint the topcoat.
6) Fixtures to be Updated
Simple projects such as updating your plumbing or lighting fixtures can make a big difference in your home. For example, you can brighten dark areas by replacing ceiling fans and updating sink and tub fixtures. Also, you can upgrade lighting fixtures to give your home a modern look.
Dimmer switches are another way to save money while creating a more relaxing environment. In addition, you can add visual interest to a room by using different lighting types.
7) Conceal your HVAC Units
HVAC equipment can be a nuisance. Furnaces are hidden away in basements and closets. However, air conditioners can be seen from afar. There are many options for hiding your AC unit. There are many options for hiding your AC unit. For example, you can put up a fence or trellis or plant shrubs in front of it. Or, you could build a small shed or cover that can be removed.
8) Improve Your Indoor Air Quality
You can improve the air quality in your home by using DIY hacks. Excess humidity, pet hair, dust, and other allergens can cause polluted air. A dehumidifier can be used to reduce moisture and condensation in your home. To reduce moisture, open windows whenever possible, use bathroom fans and kitchen fans to ventilate the house. Ceiling and attic fans can also be used to circulate the air.
To eliminate any contaminants circulating in your home, make sure to change your AC filters and groom your pets. In addition, an indoor plant filtration system will increase the oxygen in your home.
