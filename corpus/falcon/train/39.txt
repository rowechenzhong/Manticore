Psych!
Not confident that the Alouettes will be able to defeat the Riders tonight, the Montreal Gazette tries to psyche the Riders out of winning::Email me!

A victory over the Alouettes tonight at Molson Stadium would prevent the Roughriders from emerging with a 4-2 record -an important bellwether in team history.Yeah, I think we could.
In 100 years of existence, Saskatchewan has won only three Grey Cups (in 1966, 1989 and 2007). During each of those seasons, the Roughriders had four wins and two losses after six games. So what happens if the Roughriders disregard a good omen and improve to (gasp!) 5-1?
Such a record is reflective of a powerhouse. But should the Roughriders covet that label? Can they handle that status?

with larry gone, maybe a reader should contribute in order to keep reader participation friday alive...which fjm regular commenter would you most like to meet (if your mom lets you)? I find citizenx pretty entertaining, but I hate that whenever he comments I have to click whether I will allow unsecured items. Does that piss anyone else off?
I don't have that unsecured items problem with CitizenX. My mom will not let me meet anyone I meet on message boards or Myspace anymore. She says I am gullible and that I need to try and stay away from large green vans, even if they say "Free ice cream" on the side.
So I can't meet any of the commenters but I can sit in the attic and converse online, just no face to face contact.
Oh, I've got to go with anonymous (not that asshat Anonymous, mind you). I've heard he's dreamy...and so secretive! What could be hiding behind that pseudonym? Whatever it is, I bet it'll unlock the keys to my heart.
I need to stop commenting while reading trashy romance novels.
Also, if this devolves into a full-out brawl amongst the commenters for who would make the best company...well, that'd be awesome.
I'd post, but I still can't move after seeing that Simmons did a podcast with Jemele Hill. I can't figure out if the world is going to end, or I should start laughing

I saw that podcast also. I immediately gathered all of my belongings in the attic and headed for the nearest shelter with no windows with supplies for days. I am not going to listen to it but I don't see how his ego can fit into the same room with her as she creates an argument to refute.

It’s something I’ve also noticed recently: the Big Guns offering more and more supposedly-heirloom seeds in their catalogues. But how can you really be sure you’re buying heirloom seeds? And why should you care?
People choose heirloom varieties for a number of reasons. Of key concern for gardeners are the superior taste of heirloom vegetables, the ability to save seeds from heirloom plants, and the preservation of the diversity of the plant gene pool.
Patrick at Bifurcated Carrots has a great explanation of open-pollinated vs hybrid seeds, and why you should look for those two little initials (OP) on your seed packs.
And as to why you should pitch in to help preserve plant diversity? My doom-and-gloom response is that monoculture can lead to catastrophic crop failure. There are other reasons, of course. But I’m of Irish heritage and the Famine wasn’t that long ago.
The long and short of it is that the Big Guns see marketing potential in organic and heritage products. They may even stoop to creatively deceiving the customer into thinking he or she is buying heritage seeds. Or, they might just buy out the independent heritage seed suppliers, similar to what happened in the organic food industry. Scary thought.
What can we do? Buy from a trusted source. Seeds of Diversity Canada has a great resource list. In the US, there’s the Seed Savers Exchange. In the UK, visit Garden Organic. Buy, plant, save and share!
Photo via Seed Fest UK.
I knew I wasn’t the only one who was noticing this trend.
Not only can you buy from a trusted source, you can join a seed saving group and hold a Seedy Saturday, we’ve been doing it for 10 years in the Comox Valley, and now share our most productive varieties with other seed exchanges! You can also join a group and pledge to eat local foods for a few weeks, very enlightening! (Google 100 Mile Diet, or Animal Vegetable Miracle FMI)

Among other things, the agreement preserves the full package of Bush-era tax cuts for the middle class and raises rates only on the wealthiest Americans. It also permanently patches the Alternative Minimum Tax so it wouldn’t affect middle-class households.
Moreover, it extends for five more years an expansion of three major tax benefits for lower-income households: the earned income tax credit for low-income wage-earners, the child tax credit and the “American Opportunity Tax Credit,” aimed at helping families defray college costs.
But Americans may end up losing more than they’ve gained if this agreement is all that passes as “tax reform” this Congress. If so, Americans will have been robbed of an opportunity to rebuild a tax code that’s truly in their favor.
This means a tax code that’s not just less complex but whose benefits, as well as its burdens, are distributed more fairly. In particular, middle-and lower-income Americans deserve far more help than they’re getting to save and invest in their economic security.
According to a 2010 analysis by CFED, the federal government spends more than $400 billion a year—mostly in tax breaks—to help American households accumulate assets and build wealth. In addition to the home mortgage interest deduction, this includes tax incentives for retirement savings, college and entrepreneurship.
The problem is that much of this $400 billion goes to the wealthiest taxpayers. For every $1 in tax benefits that middle-income families receive, according to CFED, millionaires get $188. On average, millionaires receive a tax benefit of $95,820 each year for their savings efforts, while families earning $50,000 receive $509. Families with incomes of $30,000 get just $81. (See a related infographic here.)
But despite its current flaws, the tax code is still a principal engine of social policy, particularly when it comes to savings and retirement security. That’s why true, comprehensive tax reform is essential to building a robust savings system that benefits everyone—particularly with entitlement reform, including Social Security reform, still on the table.
In fact, helping middle-class and lower-income Americans save—and save more—will be of paramount and increasing importance. While there’s little doubt that Social Security for future generations will be less generous than it is today, there’s also little doubt that Americans are woefully ill-prepared to take on more of the burden of their own retirement security.
Just 14 percent of Americans say they’re confident of a comfortable retirement, and in fact, many Americans assume they can’t afford to retire. According to Gallup, the percentage of Americans expecting to work past 65 has more than tripled since 1990 (and most people today expect to stay on the job until they’re a ripe 67).
Enhancing savings incentives in the tax code is a critical piece of Americans’ retirement security. Moreover, there’s no shortage of proposals for improving the current system. Rep. Richard Neal (D-MA), for example, has proposed expanding the current Saver’s Credit, which provides a small “match” to lower-income savers, to benefit more taxpayers. Similarly, the New America Foundation and the Aspen Institute have proposed “matched savings” incentives to benefit and reward lower-income savers through the tax code.
Many policymakers also support the idea of an “auto-IRA,” first proposed by Mark Iwry and David John, to benefit workers in small businesses whose employers don’t currently offer a retirement savings plan.
Unfortunately, proposals such as these might have a tougher time getting their day in the sun. The fiscal cliff tax agreement gave both President Obama and Republicans big enough political “wins” that they may not feel compelled to revisit the tax code in the short term.
For President Obama, who defined “fairness” purely in terms of tax rates paid by the wealthy, the deal achieved his political goal of raising taxes on the “top 2 percent” of Americans. For Republicans, the debate now moves to the debt limit and government spending, which is turf they feel comfortable conquering. Moreover, to the extent that tax issues arise again, the likely context will be that of raising revenue, rather than reforming social policy.
Nevertheless, let’s hope that Congress can see past short-term wins and deadlines to the bigger issues of financial security that Americans are facing in the long-term, and the vital role that a sensible tax code can play in providing Americans with more tools to achieve economic security and success.

What the American people needed but did not get in the “fiscal cliff” deal was any pro-growth legislation. The deal included only tax hikes and no spending cuts. This is a deal that is likely to send the U.S. economy back into recession.In Brief
- Yes, there are guardian angles.
- Most ‘modern’ talk about angels has no basis in the Christian Scriptures.
- Archangels of Divine Mercy, Archangels of Divine Providence, whether named Bethany or Marachiel or St. Isaiah, are figments of someone’s imagination.
It seems the fad about angels, which was so prevalent in the 80’s and 90’s with Sophy Burnham and the television show Touched by an Angel, has not diminished much. A reader’s note prompts me to consider that maybe the false teachings about angels have endured long enough to almost become mainstream and accepted by even Christians to be biblical. In part, then, here is the reader’s note and them my response. What do you think?
Afternoon Scot.
… I am hoping that you can help me with a puzzle.
I recently received an email from an astrologer who has told me that I have a guardian angel. This does not surprise me in the least. Recently, I have indeed felt a presence beside me, guiding me through the days and helping give me rest at night. She continues to still my mind when it races and warms me when I feel cold and empty.
What puzzles me is that I cannot find information as to the identity of this archangel: ST. BETAHNY (sic), ARCHANGEL OF DIVINE PROVIDENCE. Only one website provided a more complete name: ST. MARACHIEL, ARCHANGEL OF DIVINE PROVIDENCE.
I have always believed my guardian angel is ever-present, and say my prayer every day. I have several guardian angel pins that I wear whenever I am out, most especially when traveling. I wear the pin not as an adornment, but as a visual reminder to me that I am being looked after by Him, and (along with my own good judgment) will be returned safely to my home and family.
Can you provide me with any information about this particular archangel and about ‘divine providence?’
Thanks, Scot, for listening. I look forward to your response.
Hi,
There is only one archangel named in the Bible, that is Michael. Gabriel, the only other named angel in Scripture, is commonly considered to also be an archangel, but that is not explicitly stated in the biblical texts. In the extra-canonical Apocrypha (those books that often appear between the Old and New Testaments) Raphael is mentioned in the book of Tobit. The Ethiopian (Orthodox) Bible’s extra-canonical book, the book of Enoch, gives the name on another angel, Uriel. These two are also commonly considered to be archangels. The extra-canonical books, while understood to be useful for learning, are never considered on the same level as the books of the Old and New Testament which are held to be the inspired Word of God. So, you are left with one, maybe two, identified archangels in the Bible.
Unfortunately, the New Age movement has taken over the biblical teaching of angels and applies the term ‘angel’ to everything from one’s emotions and urges, to wood nymphs and fairies, and then baptizes this false teaching by evoking the very biblical understanding of guardian angels. Nevertheless, this is not biblical and it is not Christian.
Yes, there are guardian angels. Psalm 91 comes quickly to mind. These mighty beings are God’s heavenly army, and messengers sent on our behalf. The New Age movement would fashion angels who hear our voice instead of God’s. Wrong. They would have us believe we can shape them, or influence them to our will. Wrong. God’s holy angels hear only the voice of God, the do only the will of God. Remember, after the fall the angels who did not revolt against God were confirmed (set forever) in their holiness, and as such would hear and do only the will of God.
I am glad you find comfort in your guardian angel pin and that your faith is strong enough to understand what the Bible teaches about the holy angels. For some however, the pin—a product of the New Age fascination with angels—will only speak of the miniaturization of the mighty angels into something that can be manipulated by us humans.
The following prayers, taught to our children from youngest age, certainly teach us a proper understanding of God’s angels working on our behalf:.
Another thing to note is that the angels are neither male nor female, yet in every case when an angel’s appearance is recorded in Scripture, the angel takes on the form of a man.
Back to your question. Who are Bethany and/or Marachiel? Who is St. Isaiah – Archangel of Divine Mercy? Figments of someone’s imagination. But don’t worry. We have a God holds us fast in His love and provides something greater than our imagination could conjure. And this loving God commands His mighty angels concerning you.
Peace,
Scot

On the Wings of God’s Angels.
well, now i know it's not true. I also received an email from an astrologer that my Guardian Angel is St. Betahny – Archangel of Divine Providence. it looks like everyone gets the same angel , and people believe it. But after reading your response to a woman, I realised you just have to believe in yourself…
thank you
Mary
I also got an e-mail from an astrologer,claiming that I am guarded by st Bethahny angel of Providence. Thanks for a straight forward answer.
we also have the same case…my astrologer also told me about that guardian angel and claimed that it was my angel.. thanks for this info, coz ive found out that this guardian angel doesnt exist…oh?! how cruel…to my astrologer, dont just make some saints ok?!
Glad you found us asia.
Must be the same astrologer–Jenna. I didn't sign up for the readings. I just keep getting emails that I am a very special person. In my research, I ended up at this site. Funny thing, I was baptized Lutheran years ago!
I have received the same e mail from Jenna….I tried looking up Arch Angel St. Bethany, and she/he does not exist. Betheny is the name of a town near the Mount of Olives. Jenna has tried for years to get me to send her money for her readings…I just can’t believe that she wakes up in the middle of the night with me on her mind…
I too find this very difficult to belive. jenna is not explaining much. I have also tried to look up angel betahny and I have come up with nothing. yes, I do feel protected sometimes, but I think its all God’s special grace. if she really wants me to belive, then she should tell us more. i really want to know, but I consider myself a rational person and I want to be convinced.
Jenna also sent me an Email and says that she just found out that St. Bethany is my Guardian angel. I guess this is what she tells every one recently, because she told the same to lots of people that I talk to
Guardian angels are true and biblical. To turn a truth of God into a lie by adding such garbage as a St. Bethany is truly despicable and a false teaching of the worst sort.
Thanks for stopping by, Tracy. I couldn't agree with you more.
Same thing happened to me, lets believe what we believe instead of wondering about devine angels.
Hi everyone, I too was given this name in a reading from you guessed it………..Jenna.
Then 3 others, none of whom were Betahny.
What is going on here………….a scam?
Anyone can buy those Angel Cards at New Age Crystal Stores etc.
They are quite beautiful, but remember this, you must have a very strong FAITH to protect yourself with, before going ahead with any thing such as this.
All my best wishes to you, I wouldn’t have found this site, had I not been trying to find out the name also.
Good Luck.
Jo.
Wow, glad I found this site, I didn’t believe Jenna but out of curiosity decided to look this so called “My guardian angel – St. Betahny up. She is still at it in 2011……. Glad I never sent her money…. Thanks for your expertise….

Wow I too keep receiving emails from jenna. This past one about that angel st. Betahny. (Atleast that’s how she spelled it for me) anyone else get that spelling for bethany? Not cool jenna..not cool!
yes i also receieved onefrom her i just deleted it..
I also recieved the same Email from her, claiming that st.Bethany is my guardian angel and I have to give her 20$ for a book about angels
it is spam pure and simple…too bad
Thanks for the true word. I know now that. Jenna is a scam artist who trying to get people to believe in her lies. So glad I didn’t send $$$. I’ve unsubscribe to her website but keep getting her emails. M
oh my god… thanks to you guys, yours is bethany mines isaiah _ archangel of divine mercy.. ive’d look to the net and i found nothing… no isaiah the archangel either google or yahoo cant give me answers… and you all know who’s behind this stuffs…
I wish everyone would feel that believing in anything spiritual only takes the love to believe. If someone truly has divine vision, then money should not be their motivation to give you that vision. To believe, pray or worship should not cost. Enjoy your life and learn the life lesson you are here to learn. In the end its all about one simple action…… LOVE
Thats, the women that contacted me.
Hi All, I too have been told by Jenna my Archangel is St. Bethany. She also states i have other angels watching over me by the names of Leila and Shanti. I am so glad i looked this stuff up. What a con. How can people go on messing with others lives like that. Im glad i never sent money, i just send her emails asking her to explain certain things to me. haha, there never is a straight forward explanation. We believe what we believe, not what others suggest we should believe. So happy i found this site.
Hi good morning to you all, I’ve been contacted by the same Jenna who told me of having a guardian angel by the name of St. Isaiah – Archangel and also contacted my spouse telling him that his guardian angel is St Michael. I looked it up and found no result of Isaiah the prophet being an angel. She also send me and my spouse the exact emails, the only thing that was different in the emails we both got was the numbers and names, wow! [This part of the] I’m so glad i found this site to see these comments because my spouse and I were talking of God sending his angels to protect him, and that was about last Wednesday night. And then Thursday morning i saw the email which was sent to me from Dec 13, 2011 by Jenna and i told my spouse. He when and checked his email and realized he received the same as well.
This is a copy of Jenna’s email.
WOW. Good thing i searched about jenna, and saint betahny. She had me fooled. Good thing I did not pay her…. Very glad! So thanks for posting about her :) I was so upset that I emailed her back asking her how she feels… screwing with peoples emotions and beliefs just to make a couple dollars!! She is unbelievable and I feel bad for the karma and all that is due to her. Thanks again!
I got the same thing about i have a guardian angel who’s name is St. uriel.Who has been by my side for the last 35 year’s Some of jenna’s Email ( Jenna post. that Angels are represented by bright rays of colored light which resemble the light.) What i want to know is dose any one see flash of light out of the corner of your eye. Cause i do. Is this normal.? I think she is a fake. And only give’s out this Email if she know’s your age. (by my side for 35 years.) And i think lot of people see flash of light out of the corner of our eye’s. Good scam jenna.
Oh wow!!!I honestly can’t believe this, it’s scaring me now. Jenna told me the same thing! Of course I never sent her money, bu how can someone do this!!! She needs to get a real job, instead of trying to scam people for their money…
Thanx friends, Jenna send me a message too in which I am been protected by guardian angel st isaiah ,but when I search for it I found there is no existence of such angels,,How cruel astrologist are ,,,but I Believe that I am been protected by God at every step of my life ,dont harm anyone never do anything wrong ,God bless you all.
Hi
I also got the famous Saint Betahny !
No weapons formed against me shall prosper. i can not bilieve that someone (jenna) would stoop that low in the name of making money. She sent me mail this morning telling me that there is someone watching over me. and i was so happy to know that because i bliv in guardian angels st. michael, gabriel and Raphael. but today jenna introduced a new saint called betahny! she does not exist! i actually learnt today that its a town where mary came from! so i started looking for answers and who she may be. But my God has prevailed yet again for he has shown me the truth by reading this site. People out there no matter how much we are deceived so that we stray away from God, if you bliv and trust in HIM, HE will show you the right way and the right path to follow.. just like i did..NO WEAPONS FORMED AGAINST THOSE WHO BILIEVE IN HIM SHALL PROSPER!
Wow, all of the comments is about jenna. All of us have been fooled that includes me!! hahahaha. I also received the same e mail (the same like dyamond.) Shamed to me!! Anyway thank you scotk. your blog really saved me.
Well well well, seems like we are all ‘protected’ by the infamous St. Betahny. No guess as to who introduced me to this angel. I’ve been going through a difficult time in my life for the past few months so out of curiosity, contacted Jenna. What great news I received about the stars and planets being in my favor! NOTHING has happened 8-[ but no surprise there after reading all these comments. I remembered thinking that how come it’s only GOOD things that were going to happen but nothing negative :-/ I mean, it sounded like a fantasy and not real life, ya know. Still, I fell victim to the hope of much positive things to come my way cause I needed something to hold on to (as we all know, the Almighty answers in his own time which is the right time and not our time so at that moment, I fell prey to something ‘physical’). Jenna sent me the exact same message as Dyamond yesterday, with the obvious changes. Does she even understand what the internet is about and the power it has of information sharing? Thank goodness for her ignorance or else I would NEVER have found this blog to read the comments. I never sent her a dime because all I wanted at the time was a guideline, an idea of what is to come. I didn’t care for the day-to-day details of the so-called turn my life was going to take. I mean, how boring to have no surprises. Anyway, thanks to everyone for their comments. My eyes are truly open now and I hope that many others will be too. I should have trusted God because he has NEVER let me down. I only hope he can forgive me cause I feel so guilty and foolish. Laterz folks . . .
Thank you to all for your feeds on this. I’ve been contacted by this Jenna today too, and I’m glad I found this site and read your comments.I had my doubts before and did not believe on what she was saying but now I’m convinced she is a real scam. I’m glad I decided to research St Betahny and found this site….Dyamond, that is exactly the same email I received today from this Jenna. 2 years on and hasn’t changed a single word on it…..I am so glad never I never fall for her rubish and did not sent her any money…
[Michael dissents. That’s okay. Scripture does not deny the reality of guardian angels. However, nowhere in Scripture are the angels at the beck and call of humans. They serve God alone. When the angels are sent or assigned for our aid, they work largely without our perceiving them, and without our awareness. Even in the extra-ordinary appearance of angels in Scripture it is in service to God’s plan of salvation. –SAK]
i’m interested to see if you post this. i never received an email, never heard the name of betahny, til one day she, or her energy was there, and she watches over me and my loved ones.
Thank you so much Father Scot for helping all of us with this piece of information. I am ashamed to say that even though I’m a Catholic, I contacted Jenna too and was told about this “archangel”, although I never sent her any money. Sometimes we don’t feel like having the patience to keep firm and let things develop according to God’s plan, and that’s maybe why we are tempted to look somewhere else. But all the answers are in the Scripture, more specifically in the Gospel, in the person of Jesus Christ.
Wow I see i’m not the only curious one contacted by Jenna Thank you God for sending me to this sight. For God is our help in all situations and I must be more careful dealing with these people of the world. God is my light and my salvation whom shall I fear! thank you Lord!
I am so disgusted at this Jenna sending me unsolicted emails and using my sacred religious belief to prosper. I too have Angel is St. Isaiah -Archangel of Divine Mercy protecting me!! Thank you sir for your honesty.A Mt. Pleasant reserve police officer was arrested after being caught peering into a teenager’s apartment window — the second time he was investigated for this type of behavior, according to police officials.
Ezra Depriest Martin, 44, 812 Hughes St., Spring Hill, was arrested Tuesday and charged with observation without consent — a misdemeanor. He was jailed and released on $2,000 bond Wednesday.
Martin is no longer affiliated with the Mt. Pleasant Police Department, MPPD Chief Tommy Goetz said.
Spring Hill Police Department Lt. Justin Whitwell said officers were called about 10:30 p.m. to Walden Creek Trace Apartments on Port Royal Road in Spring Hill. Witnesses at the complex reported a suspicious man looking into apartment windows, Whitwell said.
A Spring Hill officer arrived on the scene and witnessed Martin looking into the window, catching him “red-handed,” Whitwell said. On the other side of the window — a 19-year-old girl.
“He just said he was out walking around the building, but of course, he did not live anywhere in that area, and his vehicle was actually parked in that area,” Whitwell said about Martin’s alibi.
Martin lives several miles away from the complex, Whitwell added.
The former MPPD reserve officer was also involved in what officers called a similar incident.
On June 29, 2012, Martin was observed sitting in a car at the Burtonwood subdivision in Spring Hill looking at females through binoculars, Whitwell said. The females called police and reported Martin, stating they felt uncomfortable.
Spring Hill officers arrived on the scene, and Martin was found with binoculars in his possession, Whitwell said. Martin said they were part of his police equipment, and he carried them with him in his car, Whitwell added.
Martin was not arrested in that incident, but his name was documented in a police report, Whitwell said.
MPPD Chief Goetz said Martin was investigated, but the claims could not be verified. The reserve officer was allowed to remain on the force.
“We could not prove it, and unfortunately, it’s happened again,” Goetz said.
Martin’s ties to the MPPD were severed once Goetz heard about the arrest Tuesday. MPPD officers went to Martin’s Spring Hill residence and collected his equipment on Wednesday, Goetz said.
Martin was not on duty when he was arrested, Goetz added.
The MPPD started the reserve officer program in 2010, and Martin was one of the first to join, Goetz said. Martin was considered as being in good standing and had no other blemishes on his record, Goetz said.
“We are accountable to the public in the jobs that we do, and the positions we hold,” the MPPD chief said. “We are not going to tolerate it.”
Martin was recently commended by the MPPD for helping save a man’s life in June, Goetz said. Martin and three other officers arrived at a residence on Scott Town Road in Mt. Pleasant and found a man bleeding heavily. The officers tied a tourniquet on the man that helped save him, Goetz said.
Martin was also a volunteer fireman with Maury County Fire Department and the Mt. Pleasant Fire Department for many years, the MPPD chief added.
“He’s well-known and liked, and well-respected within our circle of professionals, and this is just a shock,” Goetz said.
Mt. Pleasant Fire Chief Tim Smith said Martin is suspended from the department until the matter is resolved in court. Smith said he has not had any problems with Martin.
Maury County Fire Chief Eric Hileman echoed Smith’s statement.
“Ezra has been a volunteer with us for probably close to 20 years,” Hileman said. “He has provided a volunteer fire service for many years without incident. This is a shock to us as well.”
The MPPD has experienced other incidents in which officers were punished for their conduct.
In May, former Mt. Pleasant police officer Jason Paul Jones, 25, of Columbia, pleaded guilty to statutory rape charges stemming from a sexual encounter with a 16-year-old boy.
Jones was placed on five years probation — two of those years are supervised. If he completes the two years without a violation, Jones will serve the remainder of his sentence unsupervised.
In Jan. 2009, two MPPD officers received written reprimands after being photographed at a Halloween party with partygoers who were making suggestive poses. Goetz was the newly appointed chief at that time after former chief Tom Wilson was fired because of the incident.Are - Take a good look around and visualize the possibilities

Thousands reported to White Sands Missile Range Sunday to march for a special group of heroes.
It's an annual tradition to remember those who died defending the Philippines in World War II. It's a 26.2 mile trek that's suppose to give participants an idea of what 1,800 New Mexico soldiers had to do.
In 1942, soldiers were captured by the Japanese in the Philippines and forced to march nearly 62 miles through the jungle to prison camps. Many didn't survive.
On Sunday, 6,200 came to participate in the 25th Annual Bataan Death March. The memorial walk attracts military personnel and civilians from all over the world.
"This is a great way to remember them, letting them know they're still with us," said Marco Chavez.
Chavez has twice made the trip for the walk from Virginia. He says it's an honor to walk.
"Although it's cold it's hard to explain, it's a warmth you feel inside to do this," he said.
Allan Armstrong was another participant. The Army man injured his legs in October. He says taking part in this march won't be easy, but he'll push himself for one simple reason.
"To remember the soldiers who have fallen before us," said Armstrong.
Seventy-one years later, there are very few survivors of the Bataan Death March. Thirteen were in attendance Sunday.You came this way: Home > undomondo > Mixes > 2010 Netaudio Favorites from Undomondo

On the minus side Walmart pays poverty wages to most of its associates, has forced workers to work overtime off the clock, has paid women less than men, drives suppliers to the wall as it demands ever lower prices, and destroys thousands of small retailers that once made for vibrant downtown areas in small towns across America.
My business ethics classes wrestled with the ethical issues, and usually disagreed about the overall conclusion. No longer, though. The bottom line seems to be that Walmart is beyond unethical—it’s a criminal enterprise.

[…] Vast Mexico Bribery Case Hushed Up by Wal-Mart « Ethics Bob […]It’s time we just call 2010 what it really is: the year of Louis CK.
With his new FX sitcom Louie off and running, garnering more favorable reviews then his last attempt at at a television show, there’s more good news for Louis and his fans. Finally, after a year of mass anticipation, his live stand-up concert film, Louis CK: Hilarious, will be airing on EPIX Sept. 18.
After the premiere it will be available through EPIX’s Video On Demand service and online at epixhd.com. We know you have all been dying to see this film after making history by being the only stand-up film to ever be presented at The Sundance Film Festival, and raking in rave reviews from top critics.
So, if you aren’t an EPIX subscriber you may want to think about subscribing. The fledgling cable channel has already cranked out new hours from Lewis Black, David Cross and Janeane Garofalo; not to mention, they were just nominated for an Emmy (Eddie Izzard’s Believe).
Hilarious will also get a limited release in theaters before its EPIX premiere. If you can’t get out to one of the theater shows. Comedy Central will also air the special in 2011, only to be followed, of course, by the DVD release of Hilarious. You can put it on the shelf next to Chewed Up and Shameless to complete your CK trilogy, and cherish it forever.Apr anyway. We'd like to keep our totes around for longer than a season, though, and preppy stripes are always in style. If you're not feeling the pink, the tote comes in navy, too. You can't get much more classic than navy and white stripes!

secondary. too many big plays. how do you remedy that situation if you are a defensive coach? put yourself in their mind for a minute, with the talent that you have in the secondary right now. >> i think it's been so frustrating for this team, and the fan base, to give up all these big plays. there's got to be a way for us to create pressure, to watch the game, they haven't created a lot of pressure throughout the year. last couple of weeks gave up more big plays. i think earlier in the year they did a good enough job remedying it with turnovers. they scored points, created turnovers. but we have not created any turnovers the last two weeks. if you can get a little bit more pressure, and hopefully create a couple more turnovers, i think that helps it out. obviously you don't want to give up the big plays. >> but turnovers obviously help the situation a bunch. this once high-powered offense sputtered the last couple of games. combined for just 25 points. obviously running the ball has not been an issue. robert a huge help, because he

can do things with his feet a few other quarterbacks can't. he is still a seventh ranked rusher in the nfl. but where is the help going to come from in the passing game? you guys obviously don't have pierre. he practiced a little bit today. no word on whether he's going to be back or not. >> it's amazing, last week, we had only two drives in the first half. and they were 18 plays, and 16 plays. we had the ball the entire first half. we just have to find a way to finish and score. i don't think we were that inefficient. we were pretty consistent until we got to the red zone. we've talked a lot about playmakers, stepping up to make plays. i think that's what great football teams do is they lean on their big playmakers to make big plays for them. we've got to continue to catch the ball a little bit better. and hopefully the big plays will come like they did earlier in the season. >> all right. cooley's return, numberswise. dismal, two games, two losses, no catches. are you glad you came back?
5:26pm

>> i'm ecstatic that i came back. it was the one thing i wanted to do is come back. it's been a good step back into football for me. and the way i've looked at it is, it's an amazing opportunity for me to be a part of this team. i want to do whatever it takes for us to be better. and i can't complain. maybe i could go in and gripe a little bit. but i just think that's out of place. for me, it's about showing them that i'm capable of doing what they need. and maybe helping out as much as i can. maybe coaching a little bit as far as logan and the other guys go. but i feel very confident in my ability to play. i feel better after being back for a couple of weeks and hopefully build my way into the offense. >> i know that's one thing that logan said. i asked if it was weird that he was catching more balls than you were, and that's a total role reversal from a couple of years ago. he said having him here to help me i've really appreciated.

Beginning with his extraordinary debut film, Japón, Reygadas has attempted nothing less than the reinvention of the art film, rejecting the formula driven conventions of contemporary “independent” filmmaking to create a body of work that fully unleashes the subversive power of the cinema. Fiercely unpredictable, Reygadas’ films contain some of the most shocking, fascinating and deliriously beautiful imagery seen on screen since the time of Jodorowsky, Makavejev and Fernando Arrabal. And, like these masters of counter-cinema, Reygadas ensures that his boldest gambits are intellectual as well as visual. From Japón to the controversial Battle in Heaven and the magical Silent Light, Reygadas creates muted, mysterious allegories that grapple with ideas of alienation, spirituality and sexuality that are central to our times. The HFA is pleased to welcome Carlos Reygadas to present his feature films and a selection of his rarely seen Super 8 films.

Reygadas’ haunting debut follows a disenchanted intellectual’s search for enlightenment and, perhaps, death in the mysterious canyon terrain of Northern Mexico. Shot on beautifully textured 16mm Cinemascope, Japón reveals Reygadas’ incredible eye as well as his remarkable talent with his cast of non-actors. The uncanny presence of animals and preternatural landscapes recalls Tarkovsky – the filmmaker who, in fact, inspired Reygadas to abandon a career as a lawyer and diplomat. Winner of the Jury Prize at Cannes, Japón is an indelible masterpiece. Print courtesy of Tartan Films.

Reygadas’ most ambitious film created a storm of controversy for its
now notorious opening scene and its unusual critique of religion, patriarchal culture and deep seated sexual taboos. Working without a screenplay and with a cast of non-actors, Reygadas cast his father’s ex-chauffeur in the lead role as a man overwhelmed by dark secrets and his attraction to his boss’ rebellious daughter. A powerful and urgent film, Battle in Heaven balances itsterrifying vision of Mexico City as a global metropolis on the verge of physical and spiritual collapse with moments of rare and even sublime beauty.

Silent Light offers a hypnotic and remarkably tender story of a man gripped by his love for two women. Set within a modern day Mennonite community in rural Chihuahua and cast almost entirely by non-actors speaking Plautdietsch, a German-derived dialect, Silent Light is both a poetic documentary of a community deeply rooted in tradition and a moving narrative of spiritual crisis and redemption. A work of unusual maturity and power that has been repeatedly compared to Dreyer, Silent Light is Mexico’s official entry for the 2008 foreign-language Academy Award.

2. How can I update? ( can you please include all the steps)
3. Will I lose any of my data when updating such as musics, game saves, etc.

partition list and enumerating
hello group,
this is kinda like a follow up on my last post.
i have a way to enumerate the problem i posted earlier.
I wanted to find all tours that are possible with the edges given. Now
I have to plot them.
consider the following. it will generate 64 lists of edges within a
list.
la= {
"{1, 4}, a",
"{1, 5}, a",
"{4, 2}, a",
"{4, 5}, a",
"{5, 2}, a",
"{5, 4}, a"
};
li ={
"{1, 4}, i",
"{1, 5}, i",
"{4, 2}, i",
"{4, 5}, i",
"{5, 2}, i",
"{5, 4}, i"
};
lai=Outer[List,Sequence@@Transpose[{la,li}]]//Flatten[#,Length[la]-1]&//ToString;
StringReplace[lai,{"a,"\[Rule] "EdgeColor ->
Blue},{","i,"->"EdgeColor-> Red},{", "a"-> "EdgeColor \[Rule] Blue",
"i"->"EdgeColor-> Red"}]//ToExpression;
Partition[%, 6]
%//Length
now what I woudl like to do is use combinatorica to show all 64
enumerations as 64 separate graphs using the same vertices as follows.
{
{{0.0, 1.5}, VertexLabel -> a1},
{{0.0, 0.0}, VertexLabel -> b2},
{{0.5, 0.75}, VertexLabel -> c3},
{{-0.5, 0.75}, VertexLabel -> d4},
{{-1.5, 0.75}, VertexLabel -> e5}
}
how do I do that? at least how do map those vertices to those edge
sets generated by the enueration above so that i canuse in ShowGraph
command?
thanks all very much in adavnce

Recent CommentsThere are two basic kinds of e-cigarettes — disposable and rechargeable.
The rechargeable type have been around longer and are generally less expensive. Blu rechargeable e-cigarettes come in a convenient pack sized case that contains the recharging unit and spare cartridges. The also cost much less with a starter kit including 25 cartridges priced at $59.95. 25 cartridges is the rough equivalent of 150 cigarettes or 1.5 cartoons taking the adjust price per “pack” down to $3.99
The disposables are more convenient, aimed at casual smokers and easier to sell in bars and other locations where smoking has been recently banned, she said.
A Krave 500 disposable e-cigarette purchased at a Wichita tobacco shop last week cost $19.95.
It’s good for about 500 puffs, the equivalent of about 2 1/2 packs of regular cigarettes. Do the math and currently disposable cigarettes cost around $8 / pack. Pretty much the high end of cigarette costs around the country these days.
The disposable cigarette almost seems destined to target the relapsing smoker. Hopefully a person determined to quick in a moment of weakness would choose the electronic alternative instead of purchasing a pack of traditional cigarettes.
Kansas House Bill 2221, which passed earlier this year and established the state ban, defines smoking as “possession of a lighted cigarette, cigar, pipe, or burning tobacco in any other form or device.”
E-cigarettes are more comparable to nicotine gum, patches or non-electronic smokeless cigarettes used as stop-smoking aids — which also are immune to the ban, said Gavin Young of the attorney general’s office.I’m so ready to depart.

It depends on such things as whether the aliens have a sense of humor. What if they left artifacts such as soda bottles and their version of Barbie dolls scattered around the solar system? How about used condoms?
“obvious bunk” wow really, it seems as though you are less objective then the people whom you are quoting, like Plait. Hoover is no slouch,
he is not a new age ufologist, he is a very competent and experienced scientist. The whole prestigious journal argument is nonsense, it seems more political then anything. I think it was wise of him to submit the paper where he did, I believe it was calculated. It is a struggling publication and out of desperation they published it with the hope of increasing interest with controversy. Hoover knew it was the only way he could get his paper noticed, if he would have sent it to the other journals they would have never published it out of fear of upsetting the apple cart. They profit off of their reputation and that is their one and only concern, not presenting information that could cause a paradigm shift. Many people who have revolutionized fields of science were ridiculed by people like you and your mentor, the science guy. The paper is new and is being initially reviewed by a panel of 100 scientists and subsequently 5000 more, the verdict is far from in right now. So I find your aggressive negativity rather puzzling. It seems as though you are hoping that it is a false claim. I dont know if it is or isnt but its way to early to say. Using the type of language that you do seems to be antagonistic to the peer review process and undermines good science.

- This study examines one possible genetic cause for differential gene expression and biological variation.
COLUMBUS, Ohio – The many short pieces of mobile DNA that exist in the genome can contribute to significant biological differences between lineages of mice, according to a new study led by researchers at the Ohio State University Comprehensive Cancer Center – Arthur G. James Cancer Hospital and Richard J. Solove Research Institute (OSUCCC – James).
The movable pieces of DNA are called transposons or "jumping genes" because they can move from one chromosomal location to another. Unlike viruses, they are not infectious and do not move from cell to cell. They have accumulated over time in the genomes of both mice and humans and now make up about half of genomic DNA in both.
For this study, researchers mapped the genomic locations of certain transposons called endogenous retroviruses (ERVs) in diverse mouse strains. They compared the different strains to learn how ERVs might influence gene expression. They found that ERVs can significantly disrupt gene expression by prematurely halting gene transcription, even when the ERV is located more than 12 thousand base pairs away in the same chromosome. They also found that the disruptive influence is affected by the gender of the parent that supplied the ERV.
The study is published online in the journal Genome Research.
"These findings add an interesting new angle to our understanding of fundamental mechanisms of natural variation and human biology, and possibly cancer and other diseases," says principal investigator Dr. David E. Symer, assistant professor of molecular virology, immunology and medical genetics and a member of the Human Cancer Genetics Program at the OSUCCC – James.
"We showed that gene expression can be influenced very strongly by a transposon located quite a distance from the premature stop site – up to many thousands of base pairs away in the genomic DNA. We also found that gene expression is influenced by whether the ERV was inherited from the father or the mother," he-known phenomenon called DNA imprinting," Symer says. "We are now conducting experiments to understand how premature termination of gene expression can be triggered by the transposons, and also how the parent-of-origin effect occurs."
By comparing patterns of gene expression near the ERVs that were present or absent in the different strains, the researchers found about 100 genes whose expression appears to be disrupted when an ERV is present nearby.
"We observed very, very strong disruption of certain mouse genes by ERVs acting at a long genomic distance, and the resulting expression differences – up to almost 50-fold changes – can have major biological consequences that distinguish between the strains," Symer says.
Funding from the National Cancer Institute, the National Institute of General Medical Sciences and OSUCCC- James supported this research.
Other researchers involved in this study were Jingfeng Li, Keiko Akagi and Christopher J. W. Hlynialuk of Ohio State University; Yongjun Hu and David E. Smith of the University of Michigan; and Anna L. Trivett, Deborah A. Swing, Natalia Volfovsky, Robert M. Stephens, Tamara C. Morgan and Yelena Golubeva of the National E.

Zildjian has completed a merger with Vic Firth. The two legendary names are teaming up, take a look inside for more info.
Craigie Zildjian, the legendary cymbal maker's Chief Executive Officer, said, "Zildjian is honored to join forces with the Vic Firth Company which has set the standard for drumsticks in the music industry."
The mutual backslapping continued with Vic Firth added: "I have the greatest respect for Zildjian. Our businesses share common values, a passion for manufacturing, and a similar approach to how we do business."
The news comes just a few days after D'Addario announced its purchased of Pro-Mark. Is there some kind of drum company Christmas sale that we've missed?Royal Navy helps Barclays with National Trust project
Volunteers from Barclays Wealth & Investment Management, the Jersey Sea Cadets, Jersey Field Squadron and the National Trust were recently joined by three Royal Navy personnel from HMS Vengeance for a community project at Fern Valley.
The volunteers helped to dismantle and replace the boardwalks and clear the footpath at the entrance to the National Trust Jersey site over two days.
The Navy’s involvement with this local project brings together the parties involved in this year’s Barclays Jersey Boat show which is forming part of the celebratory activities and events to mark the 350th anniversary of the Royal Marines.
“It was fantastic to receive assistance from the volunteers at Barclays, the Jersey Sea Cadets, the Jersey Field Squadron and the Royal Navy to help reinstate some badly damaged board walks in Fern Valley,” said Jon Parkes, Land Manager for the National Trust Jersey.
“The area is used and enjoyed by many members of the public so we’re extremely grateful to all the volunteers for giving up their time to help spruce up the area ready for the summer months.”
“Jersey has a strong relationship with the Royal Navy and with the Barclays Jersey Boat Show fast approaching it’s great that some of the crew from HMS Vengeance have been able to travel here and assist us with this local community project,” said Paul Savery, Managing Director, Barclays Intermediaries.
“This was a great opportunity to get these groups together in the run up to the Barclays Jersey Boat Show and to help the National Trust to make this project happen. I’d personally like to say a big thank you to all the volunteers.”

I’m too late to get a plan now and I doubt I could have afforded it anyway. How will the IRS ever know that I had no insurance?
Creative Spirit
Dear Creative Spirit,
You ask a very good question, and there are questions inside your question too. First things first: the IRS will find out about your insurance (or lack of insurance) when you file your 2014 tax return. Right now, they have not published any forms for this reporting. If you had your health plan from an employer, proof would show up on your year-end W-2 form. Employers report the cost of health insurance on everyone’s W-2.
If you earn less than $9,750, you are not required to file taxes and, obviously, you are not required to have health insurance either. There are lots of other escapes from the “individual mandate” — the requirement that most everyone have health insurance. A struggling art student would probably qualify under more than one of these. For example, if the cheapest plan costs more than 8 percent of your income, you are off the hook.
All of that aside, you should look at health insurance at the next open enrollment. There are lots of good reasons to have health insurance, such as you can avoid having big medical bills if you did get sick. Even great artists might need a broken bone set or an appendix removed.See definition in Oxford Advanced Learner's DictionaryLine breaks: cookie

What ever happened to reading, writing and arithmetic as career starters? This new generation is so goddamned thirsty for fame. Thats the real problem. All this need for attention and acceptance. Damn shame.
Yep. The thirst leaves you a prime target for cons… It says more about the ” models” than the faggot Bonnie and Clyde. These people rely too much on their looks they haven’t acquired any sense to match their looks…
This story doesn’t surprise me. After all there is no money in urban modeling anymore. The highlight of that time was when melyssa ford was banking between $30,000 and $50,000 a gig but now with twitpics, instagram, camera phone pics and an overflow of females who look alike-fake asses, fake hair, breast implants and mandatory stank attitude-there’s no money in it. These girls today may clear between $300-$500 a shoot which is why even popular girls like maliah end up going back to the strip club or whoring to make ends meet. Ask jacky. The saddest part is so many young girls continue to pursue it thinking they will be stars when in all actuality they will probably end up sucking or fucking some rapper/actor/actress/athelete for a few dollars. And that’s if they don’t end up doing porn. Smdh. Sistahs we gotta start wanting more for ourselves than to be someone’s sidepiece or spermbucket. I don’t admire chicks like kimbella, sheneka adams and amber rose. I’d rather have my own than whore myself out for someone else’s. Just sayin’.
There seems to be a lotta big booty white girls in urban modeling: Elke the Stallion,the Bronze Model,etc.
That ain no lie! Marcy diamond made that shit work for her when she dumped urban modeling and moved to soft porn! I’m a big fan of hers and both her and Virgo do web cam and make a killing now! No money in urbAn modeling! Girls yous gotta do cammin or clip sites that sells your clips for you
Dead@ side piece or spermbucket.. But you are absolutely right!
I find it questionable that, in “urban modeling”, anyone would earn $30-50k/gig. That is more money than some supermodels earn to walk the runway during NYFW. I remember top video girls earning $3k-5k per video, which may have included flights, hotel accommodations and even a per diem, but I have never heard of a video chick, especially Melyssa Ford, banking that much.
They are lucky to get 300 to 500 dollars, including melyssa. if melyssa makes thousands, some dummy paid her who isnt familar with urban modeling which comes at a rate of 0 dollars an hour or worse a paid price by the models. since when do models pay to be seen? shouldnt it be the other way around? so the only overhead this magazine has is taxes owed on income. i done seen it all!
@Bella-hey i was going by what i heard but then again that figure may have come from her. Lol. You know miss ford may have wanted people to think she was balling more than she was. And @anon-yeah i noticed that too. There has definately been an influx in white chicks with asses like black girls in the game. Could be to try to push out the black girls. And can you even call it urban modeling if the star chicks in it are all white? Hmmm so many questions.
I know that certain feature girls were well compensated in the mid-90s to early 2000s, during the era of Hype Williams. Once upon a time, rap videos starred Wilhelmina models who fit into sample size garments, not these wannabe Hottentot Venus heauxs in different shades.
These girls today can call themselves “vixens” all day long. They are poorly compensated strippers and/or prostitutes. They are too ugly and overweight to garner contracts from legitimate porn companies. Steven Hirsch doesn’t want these hos, neither does John Stagliano or anyone worth their salt. So they hook on Craigslist, bump uglies with some thirsty athlete for a plane ticket to Miami and a Salisbury steak at Grand Lux, only to be forgotten about by the time he ejaculates.
Tahiry (whoever the hell she is) claims to be a model or video model in Burberry circa 2005. Erica Mena claims to be a model. The bitch worked at Dash and was fired on Keeping Up With the Kardashians for not showing up to work and being a horrible employee.
If homemade sex tapes and Instagram photos constitute these chicks being models, then YES, they’re models. I don’t acknowledge any models who aren’t signed to Ford, Wilhelmina, IMG, Elite and the like.
Dying at the salisbury steak line! Lol! As for tahiry i didn’t remember that until you brought it up. Her real name is stacy cause that is the girl who was fired. Where the hell she got tahiry from is anybody’s guess but when you got girls named elke the stallion(WTF?! REALLY?!! Well mr ed and frances the talking mule were taken so…) i guess you need some weird name to stand out. And yeah we both know these girls’ futures which is why i can’t understand why so many are willing to get in that business knowing the outcome. I mean if you just wanna be a prostitute skip the urban model stuff and go straight to the corner. Save yourself some time but i guess they need the pics to advertise to future clients. Nothing says you can have me for a happy meal and a grey hound bus ticket like a pic of you bent over with your ass in the air. Classy.
I am hollering re: Mr. Ed and Frances!!! Funny story: Elke had one of her photos “Simpsonized” (sadly, the cartoon characters, not OJ). The way she looked as a Simpson is EXACTLY how she looks in reality. I only wish I saved a copy of that image. She should call herself Elke the Duck.
I regret to inform you that the Salisbury steak story actually occurred. Some stripper, groupie, wtf she is arranged a pump and dump with Kenyon Martin via Twitter. He flew her to Miami, where they dined on the fine fare at the Grand Luxe Cafe. This Bama ordered Salisbury steak. He took her back to the hotel, screwed her and gave her the boot. I don’t think he ever spoke to her again.
The worst part of that story is I HAD TO GOOGLE WTF SALISBURY STEAK IS!!! THIS HO ORDERED A DAMN HAMBURGER PATTY WITH GRAVY!!! I was sick! LMAO. A mfing hamburger patty!!! I couldn’t deal.
Melyssa ford at her highest point yes she did that is absolutely true. Melyssa ford contrary to what you think has seen a million dollars go check her out on celebrity net worth. I used to date the dude that did Melyssa’s Books in 2001-2002 and yes she was getting up to 50k for some gigs not all but some
PREACH!
Wow it’s crazy how people can just spray some people. It’s seems the more angry that they didn’t get in the magazine but y’all arent what the magazine wanted at the time. I guess but is he really gay though?
Anyone who watched Lisa Raye’s reality show would know that Marcus was shady. He posted a booty shot of her during her time as the First Lady of Turks & Caicos on the cover of Black Men’s Magazine. She was livid. Suffice to say, I would not appear in anything like BMM, Show, or any publication that lacks any sort of credibility or journalistic integrity. IMO, Smooth, BMM, etc. are beneath women like Kenya Moore and Lisa Raye. Leave that garbage to hos like Elke and Jenna Shay. That’s all they’re good for — escorting, web cam shows and booty magazines, despite the fact that they are both badly built, overweight and sagging. Black men think that isht is cute.
dude is holding about 200 one dollar bills… they aint flossin!
Right? Couldn’t it be 100s or 50s at least? And he posted that pic? What a lame.

Yep Elke is an escort u will c her ads on Eros same photos uses no name Jenna was charging 300 – 400. / hr then releases shots with Molly-Ed out solja boy and some trick nba players cash and now says she’s 1000/ hr . She makes cash from cams.. No celeb or athlete in there right mind would pay these out of pocket low level track type hoes.. And the D boys that do must be long and difficult clients. Most top notch escorts will not even date black men especially the hood or thug type. That’s not an easy client. The magazines are promotion for hoes that’s it. Those photographers aren’t even talented they are making big bucks selling dreams of getting published.. They outsource for inexpensive photoshop… They get one popular model to shout them out via twitter and its on and poppin. Stay in school ladies. I have a BA and still do my side dirt. That’s like a he diploma in this economy now .
Yeah unfortunately there is a sex tape of elke out there getting her swollen lipped sloppy fat fake silverback gorilla ass plowed by some bottom of the barrel rapper. I’m wearing dark glasses right now as my retina heal from the visual assault. And if the video wasn’t bad enough you should hear the audio track. She’s making noises like a constipated moose. Ugggh!!! @Bella-that’s why i fell out my chair over the salisbury steak line!!!! Yep girlfriend gave up the goodies for a hamburger patty with deep brown gravy! Damn shame!!! She might as well have let him take her to burger king-at least she would’ve got fries and a shake too. Mmm mmm mmm coochie ain’t worth what it used to be. Smdh. And why am i not shocked that’s a true story. Pretty soon these hoes will be giving it away for a donut and a cup of warm tap water. So sad.*prince singing voice-siiiiiiiggggnnn of the times!!*

As you can see I’m neither however I didn’t remove the video and he posted half nake pictures of me all on the net I had attorneys remove most of them when I found out. YOu girls didn’t listen. He was a bum then and is a bum now.
Umm the thirst instagram models and so called urban models. You have to check references bbb reports, rip off reports and YouTube. Just cause you a certain basketball “wife” featured on his instagram doesn’t make it legit.

Doesn’t surprise me at all. NIGGAS + the modeling world = a hot ass mess! They have turned something that was supposed to be a legitimate, specialized industry into a breeding ground for basic b-tches aspiring to be whores, celebrity thumpers and FAT BOOTY SLUTS! None of these so-called models could ever grace Cosmo or Vogue and this whole “urban modeling” bullshit is just that… bullshit! Nobody really pays real money to shoot these heauxs!!! They’ll be lucky if they collect a couple coins from a music video. There is no such thing as URBAN MODELING anymore and it’s sad that there are so many young girls aspiring to apart of this fuckery! Modeling is not a hobby. A model is in the industry to MAKE money, not give it way. If your dumb ass is stupid enough to not do your research and hand your money over to some sketchy photographer or loser with a failing magazine, you deserve to be scammed!
Ladies, wake your dumb asses up! Half of you don’t even have what it takes to be a model. Try something else BESIDES chasing fame! School teacher, doctor, business owner, scientist, engineer, chef… hell anything besides being half naked and bent over in a magazine!
… who PAYS for photoshoot??? isn’t it supposed to be the other way around. i see now why some of these chix aspire to model. they’re too dumb to do anything else.
Depends on the model. Newbies to the game will pay an established photog to get started. Or the photog gets her to pay by making promises about getting published, etc. Well established models (and that term nowadays really has no meaning whatsoever) can ask for money based on their popularity…the more exposure she has, the higher rate she can ask.
The other thing is, the whole point of modeling is to get published in mags that have wide ciruculation, maybe get a contract as a result. In reality, some of these photoshoots never see the light of day…
How did tjis “buyer beware” article turn into a model bashing blog? Smh. There are still legitimate and well mannered women in the urban modeling industry. The sad fact is people like everyone bashing on this very blog dont want to see the “good girls” u want to see the punk ass fame chasing wanna be reality star stripper hoe bitches you hear and read about from rappers songs or media takeout.. the real issue is these women need to collaberate and file a class action law suit. I was also a victim of Hassan. He tried to fuck me, rudely and aggressively kissed me at one point at the shoot, saw my reaction to it and claimed “he was trying to add passion to our shoot” i have never dealt with Marcus so i cannot comment on his side of the scam. Hasan promised myshoot would be published in black men and that was the reason he couldnt give mey pics. After a year of not bn published i asked for the proofs and was told i never paid him for my shoot. After i sent a screen shot of the paypal payment he then said i owed him 60 dollars for a full face and all he did was eyelashes and blush on my face even tho he stole my mac bronzer. I never sent the extra 60 and i never received my proofs. Hadan is a scam artist. Most models pay via paypal so the idea of a class act law suit isnt that far fetched. He should be sued.
First of all Melyssa never gotten 50k… No urban model has. Second of all even back in da days models fucked rappers to b in videos, hence Karrin Steffens… Third of all Elke the Stallions real name is Elke.. fourth, her Simpson character wasn’t made by her but a fan. Fifth, there is diff types of modeling, NOT just runway… Catalog, cars, videos etc…so everybody in here talking all this BS, get the facts straight… And hey, work for 8 bucks an hr or get 4k to Fuck an NBA player? I know my choice is made…maybe some of yall r bitter not to have access to those men that pay but instead stuck at home w some looser that takes your money and cheats…
Without women like Tahery, Maliah, Cubana etc there be no videos, no magazines, NO industry!!!!!!
Urban modeling still makes money but its the websites who do now, what happen was the internet has taken over with digital cameras and photoshop being readily available to anyone now every girl can do it and just get on a glamour site. so now its the websites who makes the money and not the magazines or the girls
If he’s such a horrible person and scam artist, why isn’t he in jail or like some of you are insinuating other people to do, file a lawsuit against him and take him to court for your money. This a big named photographer that continues to work with celebs and make his money. Clearly, he still doing something right! I love his work personal and I have seen him publish numerous no name models. What if he takes y’all to court for slandering his name. If any of this was really facts, why haven’t you taken it to TMZ, Vibe magazine, not no damn blog.. Whoever have history with the man, fuck handle your business and hire you a lawyer or is it that a lawyer won’t take your case….
what happened to my post about how he got me published!!!! and was very professional on and after my shootLeave a Review
Reviews
I've made this several times with happy results. I cut back substantially on the oil -- 2/3 c. is plenty for even 40 large shrimp; just turn them over in the marinade. The flavors are mellower than you'd guess from reading the recipe. Definitely leave the shells on to grill; I buy Gulf wild catch shrimp in the shell, deveined, from Costco (rinse well and check to make sure they are fully deveined before marinating). Next time I may add finely diced chilies for more zing.
very good, this recipe was. I specifically enjoyed the juices of three lemons. ZESTY...
I made 50 for a party. Used the lower amount of olive oil and cilantro instead of tarragon. They were oily so I peeled them and presented them on a plate. They were cool enough to handle after only 5 minutes. They were a hit!
this was very good. based on the reviews here, i used only half olive oil, and all the rest of the ingredients in full quantity. also added one large garlic clove, finely chopped. this might also be be good, i think, with some chopped ginger. but despite my modifications, i was more impressed than i expected to be, based on the so-so reviews. (and i only had time to marinate for one hour) i would make this again, without hesitation!
Very classical and delicious recipe.... But forget about cilantro instead of tarragon! Berrrrk. THE only problem with this recipe as is, is that you just can't put the same amount of FRESH or DRIED tarragon... If using dried, one teaspoon is plenty !
The tarragon struck a jarring note - coriander would have been a better match with the say and lemon (ponzu). Also, a cup of olive oil was way too much - yuck! Definitely not the greatest shrimp dish I've ever tasted - mediocre.
My rendition of this recipe is simpler, quicker, juicy, and full of flavor. Start with 30 xlg. shell-on, head-on prawns. Season with salt, and freshly ground pepper to taste. Add apprx. 1/3c. each of EVOO, and ponzu sauce (lemon and soy), 1T. minced garlic, and 1t. dried tarragon. Marinate for minimum of 15 mins. Meanwhile pre-heat stainless steel saute pan in 450 oven for 10 mins. Drain remaining marinade from prawns and spray quick-release on pan before adding prawns. Return to oven for 5 minutes, tossing to turn after 1st 2.5 mins. Remove from oven, and let rest with cover on pan. Searing on high heat seals in the wonderful juices, and carmelizes the marinade. Served with roasted cauliflower, and broccoli cooked in the same oven but started 10 mins. earlier. Simple, delicious, fuss-free meal ready to serve in 30 minutes time.
LOVE this recipe! I, too, changed the tarragon to cilantro. Each time I've made this appetizer, I've increased the amount of shrimp, and each time they have been devoured.
Was received with great reviews from our guests - the best part....marinating for two hours and just throwing them on the bar-b as guests arrived. Finger bowls with lemon slices were a must!
I've made this appetizer several times now and has been a hit with even the pickiest of eaters.DAPHNE, Alabama -- The Society for Human Resource Management (SHRM) elected two employees from Long's Human Resource Services.

La Serena, Chile - Stephane Peterhansel has snatched the lead on the Dakar Rally's second-last stage - just 24 hours after his BMW bosses ordered him to abandon his challenge.
The Dakar veteran, who has six career wins in the motorcycle section of the gruelling marathon and five on four wheels, heads into Saturday's 13th and final stage with a 26 second lead over Roma - and good chance of a 12th Dakar Rally title.
Leading South African Giniel de Villiers and his works Toyota Hilux V8 - the only vehicle in the top five that is not a Mini - finished Friday's 360km penultimate special stage a strong fourth, behind Peterhansel, Nasser Al-Attiyah and Roma.
That moved him up one spot to fourth in the general classification as well..
"We were aiming for a clean stage today and that's what we got. We tried to stay with the Minis, but it just wasn't possible. We lost maybe three or four minutes when our shock absorbers went hard at the beginning of the stage."
TEAM ORDERS
Overnight leader Nani Roma had a 5min32 advantage over his Mini teammate Peterhansel going into the 12th stage from El Salvador to La Serena in Chile.
And with Qatar's Nasser Al-Attiyah in third, BMW ordered all three Mini.”
Peterhansel on Thursday they were “disappointed” and “shocked” by BMW.”
STRONG FORM
Lucio Alvarez in the sole remaining South African built and run Team Ford Ranger maintained his strong form during the second week of the Dakar Rally by claiming a third consecutive top 10 finish on Stage 12
The Argentinian driver said farewell to the dunes of the Atacama Desert by completing the 699km stage eighth, promoted himself two positions to 22nd in the process.
The start, more than 140 metres above sea level at El Salvador, was misty but Alvarez shrugged it off and was third fastest at the first checkpoint 13km into the stage and kept up a strong pace finish 26min15 behind stage winner Stephane Peterhansel.
Alvarez stopped to change a rear left puncture two-thirds of the way through and also lost time when he had to stop and dig the Ranger out of deep sand - but the time loss amounted to just seven minutes.
"Today was another really encouraging day."
Alvarez said: "We didn't have any problems with the car and our only major time loss came when we had to stop and change a puncture, but we weren't alone in that.
"Our pace through the dunes was good. Maybe we need more torque and power but the Ranger was strong and that's encouraging for the whole team. We need to work on the car's development, especially the engine, but after three top 10 finishes in three days the potential is there for all to see.
"Near the finish there was a big bump that launched the car into the air. It came just before the flying finish and I was going as fast as I could when I hit the bump. Maybe I was a little too fast - but I'm sure it looked good for the spectators!"
"It's been a sobering experience."
De Villiers' works Toyota team mate, Dakar rookie Leeroy Poulter, has experienced the highs and lows of the world's toughest motorsport challenge - from a podium finish on Stage 3 to a huge, slow-motion roll that meant having to wait hours for the assistance truck and dropping to the back of the field.
He has fought back with gutsy performances over the past four days to start the final stage 33rd after finishing Friday's stage 23rd.
His navigator Rob Howie, who is competing in his third Dakar, said: "There's a lot of action when you start so far back - but we just kept our heads down and concentrated on chipping away at the deficit. Our aim tomorrow is to keep out of trouble, pick up as many places as we can and be there at the finish."
"We had a good stage today."
South African privateer Thomas Rundle in the ex-Giniel de Villiers Hilux V8 finished Stage 12 just 31 seconds behind Poulter in 24th, moving him up to 26th overall.
Rundle said: "We're close to the end of this great adventure and we're not about to take any chances when we're about to achieve a life's ambition: to finish the Dakar Rally, the greatest cross country racing challenge in the world.
"We've been overwhelmed by the support we've received from family and friends and fans across the world. This has carried us through what has been a momentous two weeks for us."
MOTORCYCLES
Five-time Dakar Rally champion Cyril Despres, on a Yamaha, took his second stage of the 2014 race with overall leader Marc Coma (KTM) second.
Coma has an overall lead of almost two hours over fellow Spaniard Jordi Viladoms, also on a KTM.
“Today was a very long stage, 350 kilometres,” Coma said.
“This means it is always tough, difficult and not easy for navigating. From the past we know that normally this stage is decisive.
“For tomorrow, there is still 150km and this is a lot. It's like I'm fighting for myself to be focused.”
"I didn't want to get lost."
Leading South African rider Riaan van Niekerk (KTM) played it safe as he rode to protect his 12th position overall, paying particular attention to navigation.
"I made one small mistake," he admitted, ”but it wasn't critical and I'm quite happy with the way my day panned out".
Van Niekerk was running third in the beginning of the stage and then took some time to navigate properly through the dunes around Copiapo, to finished 11th on the stage and retain his overall position.

In an effort to change that I've been trying new things, today it's spaghetti squash. Fern doesn't really like squash but I do and I'm hoping he was unhappy with past preparations and not so much the taste of squash.
I microwaved the squash for one minute on high before slicing open and removing the seeds. An article online suggested this so I did it but all it did was make the squash a tiny bit warmer. I don't know if it was easier to clean. I scraped the seeds and membranes out with a spoon then I put the squash face down in a shallow pan of water and put it in the oven at 350º for about 30-45 minutes.
Mashed potatoes shouldn't need explanation. But just for fun.
Frozen peas: Put in a glass microwave dish with a little water, not swimming. Microwave on high for 3 or 4 minutes and check for doneness. Or in a pot bring water and peas to a boil, boil softly for 2 minutes then check for doneness. Peas, and vegetables in general develop best color just as they are fully cooked. They quickly lose that color as they overcook. With a little experience I've learned to tell when they are cooked just by color. Other wise use a fork. Take vegetables off the heat before they are completely done because they continue to cook as they cool and will go mushy quickly.
That leaves just the chicken. In a plastic bag I put:
1/2 tsp garlic powder
1 tsp onion powder
1 tsp paprika
a few dried sage leaves that didn't add any flavor. Use more or none.
2 tsp flour
In another bag I flattened the chicken breasts to double in size then shook them in the seasoning bag. Into a pan with plenty of oil on just over medium heat. If the pan isn't hot the seasoning will stick to the bottom and burn. Fry till golden in color and the meat is firm, about 4 minutes per side. Raw meat will stay depressed if you poke it. Cooked meat will bounce back. That is how to tell when the chicken is done.
I scraped the cooked squash out of the rind and added butter, salt and pepper. Fern didn't like it, he just doesn't like squash. Everything else was good, especially the chicken. I liked the squash but I could live without it too.The_0<<

Sendlein fought to be Cards’ anchorPosted by on March 12, 2015 – 6:31 pm
I covered Lyle Sendlein in high school.
It was only one game, a championship game he played in with Scottsdale Chaparral, and I mostly knew of him because of his older brother Austin, who had dominated as a sophomore at the school in my last full year covering high school sports. I paid attention that Lyle Sendlein went to Texas, playing for a national championship, and by the time he reached the NFL I had been covering the Cardinals for a few years. By the time he reported for his first training camp in Flagstaff, I was now doing the same job, but for the team site.
You never know how each undrafted rookie class will sort itself out. There are almost always a couple of guys who come out of “nowhere” to make the team, and it didn’t take much to find out that Sendlein had won over offensive line coach Russ Grimm. After his rookie year — and after Al Johnson’s career was derailed with injuries — Sendlein took over at center for good.
It soothed some of the hurt of never being drafted, although it never totally went away. Not that Sendlein was a complainer. He preferred to be quiet and plug along, often his body beat up without anyone knowing. He ended up as an offensive captain on four different teams, a designation that both underscored the respect he had earned in the locker room and that made him a team spokesman. Sendlein wasn’t going to fill the notebook but he knew it came with the job, and in those years where the Cards didn’t have success, he would stand there week after week trying to supply answers that weren’t easy to come by.
He didn’t play as well as he wanted to last season, and apparently, the Cardinals decision makers noticed the same thing. When A.Q. Shipley was signed Wednesday, after Ted Larsen did fine at center when Sendlein was hurt during 2014 training camp — and with Sendlein’s big 2014 salary — things for Sendlein were headed in the wrong direction. Then Sendlein was released Thursday.
It’s early enough in free agency that he should be able to hook on somewhere. But he’ll be missed in the locker room. He’ll be missed by the community arm of the team, since Sendlein was a mainstay in those events all year.
And truth be told, I always had a kinship with Sendlein because, like him, I graduated (much, much earlier) from Chaparral and that was an easy way for us to delve into a working relationship. There are plenty of good guys who have come through that locker room downstairs, and Sendlein was unquestionably one of them.

Report: Cardinals could get IupatiPosted by on March 9, 2015 – 4:36 pm
Well, if you are hoping for a splashy free agent move from the Cardinals, you may just get your wish: Three-time Pro Bowl guard Mike Iupati, who has been with the 49ers, could be coming to Arizona.
49ers free-agent G Mike Iupati has told people he plans to sign with the Arizona Cardinals, per sources. Iupati vs. SF DT Darnell Dockett.
— Adam Schefter (@AdamSchefter) March 9, 2015
Again, nothing is done at this point. (And if you aren’t sure about that, former 49ers running back Frank Gore was reported by many as a done deal to go to the Eagles — until the reports came out Monday that he now could back away from Philly. Until a guy is signed, he’s not signed.) That said, Iupati is considered by many as the top interior lineman on the free agent market. So when Bruce Arians said he wanted competition on the interior of the offensive line, that’s one way to get it, although it kind of ends the competition before it even begins. It’d be naive to think, if they sign Iupati, he wouldn’t be an automatic starter.
Iuapti is known as a devastating run blocker. His pass blocking is not nearly as revered, especially when trying to block for scrambler Colin Kaepernick. But if he is signed it would give the Cardinals a lot of flexibility on the line. You still have to figure Jonathan Cooper is penciled in to be a starter as the 2013 No. 1 draft pick. He, like Iupati, has been a left guard, so one of them would have to play the right side. Ted Larsen could battle Lyle Sendlein at center (although with his $3 million salary, Sendlein could still be a cap casualty at some point.) The Cardinals could still look for a center in free agency too.
It’s not as if the 49ers were planning to have Iupati come back, but still, it’s a shot against an NFC West rival. And it hasn’t been a good day for the 49ers anyway, since the news that linebacker Patrick Willis likely will retire and so too might defensive lineman Justin Smith. At this rate, Darnell Dockett is going to be one of the longest tenured vets on the 49ers in a short period of time.

Posted in Blog | 27_7<< »As it continues to heal from the tragic events of last year, the city of Boston should have ideal weather and a stacked field for the 118th Boston Marathon.
No matter what, the event certainly won't hurt for lack of participation.
Race director Dave McGillivray, as passed along by The Boston Globe's Laura Crimaldi, said there will be 36,000 runners participating, which would be the second most in the event's history and up 9,000 from last year. Volunteers are also expected to turn out in increased numbers. McGillivray is expecting 10,000 volunteers. Last year, there were 8,000.
Through it all, McGillivray is supremely confident in the safety of the event. Crimaldi passed along this quote from the race director: “I truly believe because of our public safety officials that this will be the safest place on the planet on April 21."
So, have a look at the vitals for what should be a memorable day, and then I'll take a look at the top contenders.

Men's Top Contenders
Lelisa Desisa, Ethiopia
A marathon is typically thought of more as a matter of endurance and survival than strategy. That said, Lelisa Desisa has proved to be a good tactician.
In this race last year, he outran two competitors on Boylston Street to take the win. He set them up to be victims of his finishing kick, and it worked to perfection.
He won the race with a time of two hours, 10 minutes and 22 seconds, and he has no intention of letting his title go. TheStar.com's Svea Herbst-Bayliss passed along this quote from the defending champion, "I am ready to win again. I did much training."
Desisa is not the most experienced runner in the field. In fact, this will be just his fourth marathon. He won two of his first three and was second at the World Championships in Moscow in August.
Desisa set his personal best in his first race, which was in Dubai in 2013, of 2:04:45. Only one man in the field has a faster best time.
Dennis Kimetto, Kenya
In case you didn't pick up on my obvious lead-in, Dennis Kimetto is the only runner in this field with a faster personal best than Kimetto.
Like Desisa, he has run in just three marathons, and he's won two of them. He won in Tokyo and Chicago last year. He has, however, never run the Boston Marathon, and there is something to be said for experience on the relatively hilly Boston route.
The hills of this route could very well doom Kimetto, as he likes to get out to a strong start. Runner's World senior content editor Scott Douglass, via BostInno's Hayden Bird, offered up this description of Kimetto's running style:
Another thing that's interesting is that Kimetto is a guy who will sort of push the pace more in the Newton Hills more, where Desisa is sort races more like a track racer where he waits as long as possible, then pushes at the last possible moment to take the lead. It's what he did last year. Kimetto is the guy who will make a big surge after 30-35 kilometers, and then run by himself to the finish. If he does that, I'll know the ankle injury is not an issue.
If Kimetto can successfully handle this grueling task, he has a chance to open up too big a lead for Desisa to make up.
Women's Top Contenders
Rita Jeptoo, Kenya
Rita Jeptoo is back to defend her championship. She won last year with a time of 2:26:25. That was her second Boston Marathon win. Get this, though, her first came in 2006. The 33-year-old's longevity is impressive.
After her first win, Jeptoo had a child and took some time off from racing, so her drought is understandable.
She will be hoping she doesn't have to wait seven years to win another this time, and there's a strong chance she won't. Jeptoo also won the Chicago Marathon last year and turned in a personal-best time of 2:19:57 while doing so.
Jeptoo is almost a guarantee to be in the mix. On top of her strong recent form, she's finished in the top five at this race six times.
Jemima Jelagat Sumgong, Kenya
Jemima Jelagat Sumgong, 29, is looking for her first win at the Boston Marathon, but she's been close. She was the 2012 runner-up after finishing just two seconds behind Sharon Cherop.
Sumgong has looked strong as of late and could be ready to add a career-defining moment. To do that, she will have to beat her teammate and rival Jeptoo.
At the 2013 Chicago Marathon, Sumgong set a personal best with a blistering time of 2:20:48. Unfortunately for her, that was only good enough for second as Jeptoo was also busy turning in her personal best.
Although Sumgong came up short in that race, she is no stranger to winning. She won in Rotterdam last year.
Jeptoo is a strong favorite to repeat in a loaded field. If she fails, however, Sumgong is the best candidate to topple her.Jeremy Stephens is being held in Polk County Jail on $100,000 bond after being extradited to Des Moines, Iowa, after his arrest in Minneapolis last Friday on felony-assault charges.
During an altercation last year in the parking lot of a sports bar in Des Moines, the UFC fighter allegedly joined an associate, Dustin James Bachman, in repeatedly attacking an unnamed victim to the head and body, according to the Des Moines Register, which cited police reports.
After being allegedly assaulted by Stephens and Bachman outside Fat Tony's Sports Tap, the victim reportedly made it to a car with the help of his wife when Bachman dragged him out by the feet. Stephens and Bachman then kicked and punched the victim for about a minute, the report said. The victim lost consciousness and stopped breathing twice before being intubated and transported to a hospital in critical condition.
Bachman, 27, was arrested the night of the incident, Oct. 15, 2011, and charged with willful injury and assault causing bodily harm. Stephens spoke to authorities and was not taken into custody.
"There's witnesses that can prove that Jeremy had not assaulted anybody," Stephens' manager, Ryan Hass, told ESPN.com the day after his client was apprehended. "It's definitely a misunderstanding of his name becoming involved, other than him being a UFC fighter, it was his party, and him being friends with the guy that actually did it."
Hass suggested it is "just very unfortunate that you can't get so-called friends to man-up on their charges," and, instead, Bachman attempted to get himself "off the hook" and "take down" an innocent person.
Hass said Stephens, 26, was not contacted by Des Moines police save for a discussion after the incident. Authorities claimed otherwise, stating to the Des Moines Register that Stephens was aware of the outstanding warrant and had several opportunities to surrender in Iowa.
Des Moines police said the first opportunity to arrest the UFC-affiliated lightweight, who lives and trains in San Diego, occurred when he was scheduled to fight Yves Edwards on Oct. 5 in Minneapolis. The warrant stipulated police only could arrest Stephens in Iowa or surrounding states. Local law enforcement handled the arrest, criticized by Hass and Stephen's promoter, UFC president Dana White, for its timing mere hours before Stephens was slated to fight on a nationally televised card.Tasty Treats For Halloween Bashes: Sparkly Cookies on Sticks

Does any1 know how to produce colored console output wo/ using ncurses or similar?
There's a module packaged with Gentoo that lets you do it (which I mistakenly put into my app QuickRip thinking it was a standard lib!). I've attached it to this message. You can then just do:
Code:import output print output.green("hello")
Just messing around with output.py, have to point out that this will not work on windows simply because linux and windows consoles work differently, instead of printing a new color in windows it simple prints the color code followed by the content and the color codes escape sequence, which in linux would cause colored output.
I dont know if it is possible to get colored output on windows, but if somone takes the time to write the modules i'm sure that this would be included in the Python standard lib!
glad that you found it telex,
Mark.

I'd say Testosterone. That may seem odd as it is the expected base to the majority of cycles, but it is always presupposed that this is not enough. I'd definitely say Test. is the most underrated.

July 10, 2014 - MyFoxDFW.com
DALLAS - A girl from Trophy Club is waiting to make history with a lifesaving liver and kidney transplant.
It sounds scary for an 11-year-old, but Maddie Smith and her family are some of the most positive people.
Trey Smith said he will do whatever it takes to put a smile on his daughter's face.
"We have dress up parties where she gets to dress dad up in feather boas and we have finger nail parties. She gets to paint my fingernails and I paint hers," he said.
Maddie was born in Bedford, but shortly after was brought to Children's Medical Center in Dallas.
"She was breathing a little heavy and the doctor was smart enough to check her blood gases that showed it was way out of wack," her dad said.
"It was such a blur. When someone tells you something is wrong you just kick in to survival mode," added Jessica Smith, her mother.
At three days old Maddie was diagnosed with Methylmalonic Acidemia, a rare genetic disorder. Her body is unable to process certain proteins and fats properly. If not caught early, it can lead to death.
The diagnosis saved Maddie's life, but the family had no idea the struggles ahead.
"She is on a very strict regimen of a diet. She has a G button which we give her formula through. Basically every three hours we're giving her something to keep her metabolism engaged. She also gets night feeds at night. And, we've been through phases of chronic pancreatitis where she would get pancreatitis over and over again," Trey said.
Maddie currently undergoes dialysis at the hospital three days a week. Each treatment takes about three hours.
In the next few months she hopes to get a liver and kidney transplant. She will be the first child in the area with her special condition to receive a double transplant.
The scary thing is nationwide the number of people donating is down.
Maddie's doctor says saying yes to organ donations can save so many lives.
"We can get the heart, two lungs, two kidneys, one liver, one pancreas and one small bowl so there are eight individuals who can benefit from every donor," said Dr. Mouin Seikaly with the Children's Medical Center of Dallas.
Maddie is ready to conquer what lies ahead. Her family says together they will get through it.
"Something like this can either break you or make you and I think a lot of it is a choice. It's really easy to allow negative thoughts destroy you. We agreed early on that we weren't going to do that. We were going to stick together and allow each other to have bad days. It's a big deal, forgiveness and just being positive and allowing ourselves to think anything but positive," Jessica said.
"Maddie has just been this, not only glue in our family but she is a beacon of light. She never complains. She has an incredible positive attitude on everything. Sometimes we sit back and say how can we complain when she takes everything with such grace," Trey said.
The Smith family has set up a non-profit organization at GoTeamMaddie.org. More information is also available at childrensmiraclenetworkhospitals.org.

History
In 1852 the City purchased land forming Kelvingrove and Woodlands Estates for the sum of £99,569 to create an area which is now known as Kelvingrove Park.
- The Park was created for the rapidly growing West End of the city for the recreation and amusement of the citizens of Glasgow
- It was one of many Victorian parks created in response to the appalling conditions created by rapid urban growth, resulting from the industrial revolution.
- The park was the first purpose designed and constructed park in Scotland and it rapidly became a considerable attraction
- It was designed by the leading landscape designer of the time, Sir Joseph Paxton who also designed the Crystal Palace in London
- Kelvingrove is one of the city's best loved historic parks, an enduring legacy of Victorian urban parks, which has a special place in the hearts and minds of the people of the West End.
- It has been used twice for International Exhibitions in 1888 and 1901 as well as being used for the Scottish National Exhibition in 1911.
- The magnificent Art Gallery and Museum which is a prominent feature of the park was built for the 1901 Exhibition.
- The Doulton fountain, which has undergone a £5m refurbishment at Glasgow Green, was originally located in Kelvingrove for the 1888 International Exhibition.

Capturing mobile telepresence through logging and video shadowing: a two-phase study design
- Field Methods
We used a two-phase study design that incorporated a novel video shadowing approach to learn how close-knit groups use technology to stay connected while mobile and to identify their unmet needs. In the first phase, we conducted a logging study with small groups in which each member logged all their interactions over 3 days, enabling us to identify suitable groups for the second, video shadowing phase. In the second phase, we separately observed and video recorded each member of the selected groups over the same half-day period as they connected in both mobile and stationary settings, a novel approach that others have been reluctant to try. This targeted shadowing approach enabled us to gain a rich understanding of the groups’ interactions across multiple media and devices that would not be possible using other indirect methods.

Stars Mark Wahlberg, Nicola Peltz and Jack Reynor feature in the photo posing in front of a rundown gas station. Wahlberg plays a struggling inventor and single father, with Peltz as his daughter Tessa and Reynor as her racing car driver boyfriend Shane.
The trio will be taking over from previous Transformers stars Shia LeBeouf and Rosie Huntington-Whiteley.
Plot details are still under-wraps, but director Michael Bay recently revealed to ComingSoon.net that the movie will feature a ‘chase from hell’. Producer Lorenzo di Bonaventura has also let slip that Dinobots will be a big part of the story.
Stanley Tucci, Kelsey Grammer, Sophia Myles and Li Bingbing join the cast this time round.
Wahlberg recently praised the film, describing it as ‘fresh’ compared to the previous three.
He told MTV: ‘Obviously, it’s a really interesting dynamic, being a young, single dad having a teenage daughter, trying to succeed as an inventor, having very little means and also trying to provide for my family. Then all hell breaks loose.’- TRAVELERS

Pembrokeshire, WalesThe Cockroach Problem
This week, Kyle and I (don’t worry his post is coming!) have switched gears entirely and really got into the nitty gritty of things. Having searched through the archive, we pulled posters from the artists that lay in Professor Tensuan’s field of interest and began to analyze. I focused mainly on Lalo Alcaraz, a Mexican-American cartoonist, who is known largely for his nationally syndicated, highly political daily comic strip La Cucaracha (aka the cockroach).
Here are some of his posters:
My favorite, thus far, though is this one:
Background: In late 1991, four officers of the LAPD (Stacey Koon, Laurence Powell, Timothy Wind, and Theodore Brisenio) were accused of using unnecessary force in a March 3, 1991 beating of“Rodney” Glen King, an African-American motorist. The case known as the Rodney King Trial was based on footage recorded on home video by a bystander (George Holliday). The now famous video was broadcast nationally and caused tremendous response because the beating was believed to be racially motivated. Daryl Gates was the head of the L.A.P.D. at the time and faced strong criticism as well as calls for resignation from the Mayor.
On April 29, 1992 the jury acquitted three of the four officers (Koon, Wind, and Brisenio) and did not reach a verdict on one (Powell). The acquittal led to the infamous 1992 Los Angeles Riots and mass protest around the country.The riots, beginning in the evening after the verdicts, peaked in intensity over the next two days, but ultimately continued for several days. A curfew and deployment of the National Guard began to control the situation; eventually U.S. Army soldiers and marines were ordered to the city to quell disorder as well. Fifty-three people died during the riots with as many as 2,000 people injured. Estimates of the material losses vary between about $800 million and $1 billion. Approximately 3,600 fires were set, destroying 1,100 buildings, with fire calls coming once every minute at some points. Widespread looting also occurred. (Wikipedia)
This poster shows Daryl Gates and George H. W. Bush (who was president at the time of the riots) on an inner city basketball court, against a chain link fence. The poster blatantly and deliberately copies and appropriates the famous poster for the 1992 basketball comedy “White Men Can’t Jump” (released in March) starring Wesley Snipes and Woody Harrelson. Gates stands in place of Snipes, with the word “Daryl” positioned over hishead, just as “Wesley” was positioned over Snipes’. Whereas Snipes looks calm, collected, and even intimidating, Gates looks nervous; Snipes’ orange baseball cap is gone to reveal Gates’ baldness and a comically large drop of sweat across his forehead. Whereas Snipes’ athletic jersey was blank, Gates’ says “Property of L.A.P.D.”
Similarly, George Bush, Sr. takes the place of Harrelson (with “George” written over his head, instead of “Woody”). The backwards baseball cap is still there, but the plain white t-shirt now reads “White Men Can’t Run The System” instead of “White Men Can’t Jump.” Like Gates, Bush, Sr. also looks worried; he is frowning. Furthermore, the basketball hoop that could be seen through the chain link fence in the movie poster is has become the Los AngelesCity Hall on fire. In place of the movie credits at the bottom of the poster is the phrase “From the Courts of Simi Valley, To the Streets of L.A” – a parodic echo of a generic tagline for a movie.
In the context of the movie, Snipes and Harrelson alternate between rivalry and friendship, ultimately ending up friends. In the context of the riots and the Rodney King verdict, Gates was sharply criticized charged with responsibility for the King incident, Bush Sr. notably expressed bewilderment over the acquittal of the L.A.P.D. officers. Whereas Gates can be clearly identified as an antagonist, Bush, Sr.’s case is more ambiguous: while he disapproves of the verdict, he similarly responsible as he is in charge of the country. More significant, however, is the fact that ultimately just as Snipes’ and Harrelson’s characters were engaged in the same sort of shady business and played the same game (and in the end, on the same team), so do Gates and Bush, Sr. Though the two may seem to be at opposite ends, they are really not so different from one another. The phrase “White Men Can’t Run The System” is saying two things at once: firstly, that white men are incapable of running the system and secondly, that they should not be allowed to do so.
For me one of the essential questions about this work is: why choose a comedyabout basketball as a background for social commentary regarding the King case and the L.A. riots? The simple answer is that a) it was culturally relevant at the time, as the movie was released a mere month before the riots and b) it took place in L.A., at VeniceBeach.However, in my mind, there seems to be something particularly unsettling,and therefore significant, about the fact that not only is the artist using a feel-good sports comedy as his source material, but that he is turning to light popular culture – specifically, the visual medium of cinema (produced primarily in Hollywood/Los Angeles no less)–in the process. Considering the amount of media coverage the two events received and how it was a video recording (made by a bystander) that exposed the L.A.P.D. officers’ brutality in the first place, one cannot underestimate the importance of the element of cinematic sensationalism. The Alcaraz’ viewer is forced to reconcile the pleasure of watching an action comedy set in L.A. that is evoked by the White Men Can’t Jump reference with the possibility of schadenfreudian pleasure of watching mass violence in L.A.on the evening news. The ethics of viewership and spectacle are being decidedly called into question.What You Need to Know About Life InsuranceFiled under: All Infographics, Business Infographics, Cultural Infographics, Educational, Environment Infographics, Financial Infographics, Health Infographics, People Infographics | Comments Off on What You Need to Know About Life Insurance

As many as eight leaders, who are being seen to lead their industries in the years ahead, have found a place in the list, the US-based Fortune magazine said about its inaugural list. Writing about food and beverage company's chief, the magazine said, "Nooyi has a profound effect on the rest of the industry. Her mantra is 'performance with a purpose' or making PepsiCo's overall food and drink portfolio healthy."
Apart from Nooyi and Cameron, FDIC Chairperson Sheila Bair, Duke Energy CEO Jim Rogers, Christoph Westphal of Sirtris Pharmaceuticals, online marketplace Amazon's chief Jeff Bezos, environmentalist Steven Chu and Andy Rubin of Google also figured in the list.
Besides, Cameron spotted a place in the list because of his vision to remake the entire movie-going experience with the use of 3D technologies in its latest sci-fi thriller 'Avatar'.
"Rather than use existing technology, the director co-developed a new generation of high-definition stereoscopic cameras," the report said. Bair, who is in-charge of managing the insurance fund for the America's roughly 8,000-plus banks also cornered a place.
"She took a typically sleepy position and made it central, anticipating the credit meltdown and lobbying for legislation to stop foreclosures," Fortune said. Interestingly, the list has people from various industries including, consumer goods, entertainment, environment, telecom and pharma.

PORTABLE AND ADJUSTABLE STAND 2 Sheets-Sheet 2 INVENTORS. 1.5a LEV/TAN- REGINALD LOU\$ PEQ Ams BY a /W rrakrva'f nite States Patent PORTABLE AND ADJUSTABLE STAND Leo Levitan and Reginald Louis Perkins, Montreal, Quebec, Canada Application June 29, 1954, Serial No. 440,158 2 Claims. Cl. 311-39 The present invention pertains to a novel portable and adjustable stand suitable for supporting various objects such as artists materials, doctors and hospital equipment, barbecue materials and the like, but disclosed herein as a tool box.
The principal object of the invention is to provide a device of this character useful in various shops and plants in which a handy tool box is needed. An illustration is found in work on motor vehicles, aircraft and the like, in garages, service stations, factories and other shops. In such work, not only should the tool box be portable, but it could be used more effectively and conveniently if capable of being supported at various levels.
Another important object of the invention is to provide a tool box that can be adjusted to various levels. This object is accomplished primarily by mounting the tray of the device on lazy tongs which in turn are provided on a base fitted with casters. The tongs are locked at various heights by a mechanism constituting another feature of the invention and described in detail below.
A further object of the invention is to provide a construction whereby the tray may be converted to a bench or working surface. For this purpose, lid sections are engaged on opposite edges of the tray to swing inward and form a continuous surface covering the tray. Suitable means are provided for retaining and locking the lid sections in one plane.
The invention also provides a mechanism for latching the tray to the base when the lazy tongs are collapsed. In this condition the tool box is preferably closed by the lid sections as described and easily carried from place to place as any conventional tool box.
Other objects and advantages of the invention will appear as the description proceeds.
The invention is fully disclosed by way of example in the following description and in the accompanying drawings in which:
Figure 1 is a perspective view of the device in raised position;
Figure 2 is a plan view;
Figure 3 is a section on the line 3--3 of Figure 2;
Figure 4 is a section on the line 44 of Figure 3;
Figure 5 is an exploded detail perspective View;
Figure 6 is a section on the line 66 of Figure 4, and
Figure 7 is a top plan view of the base.
Reference to these views will now be made by use of like characters which are employed to designate corresponding parts throughout.
In Figure 1 is shown a base 1 in the form of a rectangular frame mounted on casters 2. Within the base is secured a guide member comprising a longitudinal strip 3 lying midway between the ends of the frame 1 and having transverse parts 4 lying along the ends of the frame. The strip 3 is slotted lengthwise at 5, and one-half of each member 4 is slotted at 6 for a purpose that will presently be described.
Lazy tongs 7 comprised of crossed and pivotally joined links in the usual manner extend upward from the parts ice 4. The lower end of one of the lower links of each lazy tong is pivotally attached to one end of the corresponding part 4 by a suitable pin 8, and the lower end of the other lower link is slidably mounted in the corresponding slot 6 by a headed pin 9. The parts 4 are spaced from the adjacent ends of the frame 1 to receive the lower ends of the lazy tongs as shown.
On the upper ends of the lazy tongs is mounted a box or tray by a means that will be described. This member is formed preferably of metal shaped into two parallel channels 10 facing upwardly. The partition 11 between these channels is a double walled element forming a downwardly facing channel 12.
The channels are closed at each end by a plate 15 suitably fastened thereto and doubled downwardly and outwardly from its upper edge to form a vertical flange 16, which is slotted at 17 partially along its length. To one of the upper links of the lazy tongs 7 is pivotally attached an arm 18 received behind the corresponding flange 16 and fastened thereto at points 19, to support the tray 1012. The remaining upper link of each lazy tongs '7 carries a pin 20 slidably received in the corresponding slot 17.
On the outer surface of each flange 16 is pivotally attached a notched bar or rack 21 having its teeth 22 lying along the slot 17 and facing downwardly. The pivotal attachment is made at point 23 nearer one end of the bar, and the other end is formed with an arcuate slot 24 receiving a screw or pin 25 that extends into the flange 16. Thus, the pivotal movement of the bar is limited by the slot 24. The remaining ends of the bars 21 are joined by a tie bar 26 extending lengthwise of the tray for simultaneous movement of the bars 21. A continued upward movement of the handle bar 46 may be used to lift the tray while extending the lazy tongs.
It is now evident that the tray may be supported at selected levels within the range of the racks 21, as desired for various jobs. In lowering the tray, the racks are first lifted from the corresponding pins 20, and when the adjustment has been made, the racks are lowered to engage the pins 20 in the new position. In raising the tray, the racks need not be disengaged completely from the pins, since the rack teeth slide over the pins on the movement.
Additional support for the tray is provided by a third lazy tongs 30 between the lazy tongs 7 and perpendicular thereto. One of the lower links of the tongs 30 is pivoted at 31 to the strip 3, and the remaining lower link carries a pin 32 slidable in the slot 5. To the upper links of tongs 30 is attached a plate 33, one of these links being pivoted to the plate at 34 and the other link having a pin 35 slidable in a slot 36 in the plate. The lower edge of the plate 33 is flanged at 37, and when the plate is inserted in the space 12, the flange 27 is secured to the tray at points 38.
In this connection it may be noted that the several pins on the lazy tongs slidable in slots are preferably in the nature of double shouldered screws or studs engaging opposite sides of the slotted members for a well guided sliding movement. As a further refinement, the teeth 22 of theracks 21 may differ from conventional racks by being unequally spaced. The spacing of the teeth is determined in such manner as to adjust the tray in equal increments of height, notwithstanding the varying factor in the relation of the vertical and horizontal adjustments of the lazy tongs. The teeth 22, moreover, are directed angularly downward for a confined locking engagement with the pins 20 and for cam action against the pins in raising the tray. The weight of a loaded tray insures a sure lock. The tray may be lifted directly by the tie bar 26, inasmuch as such lifting automatically disengages the racks 21 from the pins 20.
Patented Sept. 10, 1957 The outer walls of thetray -12 are double flanged inwardly at from the upper edges for the attachment of lid sections 41 by piano type hinges 42. When formed inward, the sections 41 rest on clips or brackets 43 on the side walls of the channel 11. Dogs 45 are securely attached to the lid sections. When the sections are closed as in Figure 1, the dogs are swung so that each extends from its section to the other section, thereby bringing their apertures 45 into register to receive a padlock (not shown). The sections in this position serve the purpose of a bench surface. The top of the channel 11 may carry a central handle 46 for rolling the device or lifting it to various elevations or for carrying when locked in the collapsed position as will now be described.
To the bottom of the tray 10-12 is fastened a pair of angle brackets 50 through which is passed a clevis pin 51. On the pin is rotatably mounted a hooked latch 52 backed by a wire spring 53] The pin 51 is retained by a cotter pin 54. On the bottom flange 55 of the base 1 is secured a bevelled plate 56 engageable by the latch 52 on its downward movement, to guide the latch into hooking engagement with the bottom of flange 55.
Although a specific embodiment of the invention has been illustrated and described, it will be understood that various alterations in the details of construction will be made without departing from the scope of the invention as indicated by the appended claims.
What we claim is:
1. An adjustable stand comprising a base, lazy tongs having their lower ends attached to said base, a tray mounted on the upper ends of said tongs, slotted end plates on said tray, said tongs each having one of its upper links pivoted to an end plate and its remaining upper link slidably mounted in the slot of said plate, and a downwardly facing notched rack pivotally mounted near one of its ends on each of said slotted plates directly adjacent thereto and engageable adjustably with the slidably mounted link of the adjacent tongs, said end of each rack having a curved slot, and a pin in said slot and attached to the corresponding plate, whereby to limit the swinging movement of the rack.
2. An adjustable stand comprising a base, lazy tongs having their lower ends attached to said base, a tray structure mounted on the upper ends of said tongs, means on said tray for locking said tongs in various elevations, another lazy tongs mounted on said base at right angles to the first tongs said'tray structure having a downwardly facing channel, a slotted plate secured in said channel, the last named lazy tongs having its upper links respectively pivoted to said plate and slidably mounted in the 7 slot thereof.

[Return to Previous Page]I am a student in the last year in the school of Veterinary medicine. We usually operate on dogs and cats, sometimes these operations are to remove cancer or for any other reason. But recently, unfortunately, some people want to imitate the western people; they want to remove the testicles, ovaries, wombs or to cut tails, etc. Actually there is no need for such operations; it is only the owner’s desire. Many of them do not use dogs for guarding; they just keep them as pets at home.
My question is: what is the ruling on these operations?.
Firstly:
It is proven that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “Whoever keeps a dog, except a dog for hunting, farming or herding livestock, one qiraat will be deducted from his reward every day.” Narrated by the two Shaykhs (al-Bukhaari and Muslim) in their Saheehs. And he (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “Whoever keeps a dog that is not for farming or herding livestock, one qiraat will be deducted from his reward every day. Saheeh – agreed upon. From these texts and others it is known that what some Muslims do, keeping a dog for none of the three reasons mentioned by the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him), and only doing that in imitation of the kuffaar or just for fun, is haraam and cannot be justified under any circumstances.
Secondly:
Giving medical treatment and food to permissible animals should be done only as much as is needed, and spending on them should not go beyond that to the extent of extravagance, because that is the action of the brothers of the devils, as Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): “Verily, the spendthrifts are brothers of the Shayaateen (devils), and the Shaytaan (Devil‑Satan) is ever ungrateful to his Lord” [al-Isra’ 17:27]. What is mentioned in the question about some people doing surgery on these animals for which there is no need, rather it is more akin to fooling around, is undoubtedly haraam, because it is changing the creation of Allaah or mutilating the animal, and this is the action of the devils, as Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning):
:118, 119]
And when the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) passed by a donkey that had been branded on its face, he said: “May Allaah curse the one who branded it.” Narrated by Muslim in his Saheeh.
Moreover these operations are a kind of extravagance and inappropriate spending. What is befitting for the Muslim is to be moderate in his spending and use of permissible things, and this world should not be his main concern or his ultimate hope. Allaah says, describing His righteous slaves (interpretation of the meaning):
“And those who, when they spend, are neither extravagant nor niggardly, but hold a medium (way) between those (extremes)”
[al-Furqaan 25:67]
This had to do with permissible things, so how about things that are not permissible? Each person will be asked on the Day of Resurrection about every dirham that he acquired: how did he earn it and on what did he spend it?
And Allaah is the Source of strength. May Allaah send blessings and peace upon our Prophet Muhammad and his family and companions. End quote.

Victorique has the appearance of a small (4′ 7″), almost doll-like, girl with long golden hair and emerald eyes and a voice that sounds exactly like that of an older woman. Another important part of Victorique’s appearance is a pipe that she smokes when thinking about something; though in the anime, it is never shown to be lit or showing her smoking due to her young age. She spends her days at the conservatory at the top of the library, reading several difficult books, often in different languages, simultaneously. She points at one wall of the library and has told Kazuya that she has read almost all the books over there. Along with her sharp tongue, abusive bluntness and eccentric attitude, she possesses amazing detective skills.

Or was it Ike?
Robert Arthur comments on Ike Turner’s recent death, noting many headlines such as “Cocaine Killed Ike Turner”. He surmises that there may be, as Paul Harvey likes to say, “more to the story”….
Arthur notes that Turner being in the advanced stages of emphysema may have chosen to end his own life, with cocaine as the tool rather than the cause.
People often commit suicide by running a car in a garage. Do cars get blamed?
No. But ‘Cocaine killed Ike Turner’ is apparently a better headline than ‘Ike chose to end his own life with cocaine’.

Feds, its time again, I'd like to be Party President for this coming July-August term. Its been a good while since we've had a two term PP, so you all get to decide for yourselves, did I do what I said I would? I made some very specific pledges last month, and I submit to you my record:
Nominate the popular vote winner for CP
I nominated Paul, who was the popular vote winner. But I also made completely-stalled talks continue and by working with other PPs, made the unity process change so that everyone now noms the popular vote winner. Goal achieved.
Message Newbs
I admit I've missed a few days but I fulfilled this promise. I regularly PM new players, offering them help, as well as party members.
Write 2 Articles a week
I'm just over 3 weeks into my term and I've written 7 articles: I'm on track to deliver on this promise.
Run My Own Cabinet
Cabinet discussions have happened daily and I'm quite happy with all my directors (I hope they're happy with me
). All members of my cabinet are working hard and I know exactly what they're doing.
Maintain a Channel with other top 5 PPs
I suppose this is kinda up to your judgement. I found out last 16th that a forum board and a channel already exist for PPs, but those areas include PPs, two people each PP can pick, DHS people, random national people, and some people who dont play erep anymore but have admin on eUS forums. Because the channel and board already existed, I decided not to start right away with trying to force a brand new PP channel, the existing systems had to be tried out first. Those areas turned out to not be so hot, but I have supplemented them with in game forum threads (several between myself, t4, and 6ther parties), and good deal of talking on IRC. Next month a new channel will be made for only PPs, cause thats how stuff gets done.
Read every single post on the forums except for the spam threads
Okay, I admit it....I also didn't read every single supply request post
I did read everything else though, and I've kept a close eye on what every single fed has to say.
Lead Party Meetings Personally
I've been running these myself for months, and this past month was no different.
My proposed cabinet for this month has a few changes from last month, but here it is, these guys are all awesome:
VPP: Tyler Buublar.
Tyler did an excellent job as Political Director this month, beyond what even I had imagined. He would like to be PP one day and I think that in a months time he'll be by far our best option for it. I'm thrilled he accepted to be my VPP
Recruitment: Logamac
Logamac has had this position before, though he's been out for some time. He directly asked me for the job and I was impressed with his adamance that he would grow this party even more. He deserves another shot I think.
Retention: Clydeo
Clydeo has made marked improvements in the functioning of this department the past month, and deserves to be able to stay on
FBI: MikeyPenny
Mikey watches you in your sleep. He watches your mother in her sleep. He watches me in my sleep. To be honest, I'm just scared of him and what he would do to me if I tried to have a different FBI director.
Political: Tyler Buublar
Best PD in years. I asked if he wanted to keep up, and I couldn't possibly ask for anyone better.
ATO: Josh Frost
Josh remains one of the most capable people when it comes to mobilizing America. He's been an invaluable contributor this past month, and he's utterly relentless in his burning desire to kill serbians.
Fed Express: Evil Elvis
Evil is one of our newest feds and his level of activity inspires a raging fed boner while I sleep. He took over Fed Express about a week ago, and is already doing an amazing job.
SHIELD CO: Crashthompson
CrashThompson has made SHIELD what it is, and if you're in SHIELD you know what I mean. If you're not in SHIELD, you better be running for your life from this guy, cause I think he just slaughters the villages of anyone not wearing the same uniform as he is, just to be safe.
Media: NewAzazel
One of our best writers and one of the biggest fed names in the US, and the world. Naz did solid work last month and his level of activity makes me quite happy he's sticking around.
Most importantly feds, pay attention this 15th. We're working hard to elect Derphoof in the AFA, Just like last month guys, its time to go fight some serbians.
In the meantime, please consider voting for me, elections are happening right now on the fed forum!
> for the man in the suit

He's usually very fast. I'm surprised he hasn't shown up yet.
Too busy with his Servian MoFA duties, I suppose
I really love that gif.
You can't not vote for the guy from Suits in the suit, I mean, come on.

Solved video issueThe heavy call volume in the February expiry would appear to say yes. But unfortunately for Apple investors, a closer look at the activity suggests otherwise.
About 67,000 of the Feb. 360 calls were sold on Thursday — that's nearly three times the open interest of all outstanding contracts — notes Dennis Davitt, First New York's Head of Equities Derivative Trading. Call selling is actually a bearish bet on a stock, in which options traders give up the right for further gains in exchange for the premium received on the sale.
The call sales come after reports in tabloids that CEO Steve Jobs is sicker than previously thought. Shares closed nearly $5 lower to $358.30 Thursday.
"The stock is pinned at $360 for the next few days," said Davitt.
With February expiration coming today, options traders see little risk that apple will go appreciably higher. "Investors are happy to roll the dice till Friday afternoon, given it will likely be a lighter day, and they'll only have to roll it for a day," said Scott Nations, NationsShares Chief Investment Officer and Options ActionContributor.

Deion, of course, is a walking billboard for himself and a man not particularly known for being publicity-shy. Nonetheless, some cops working a youth-football detail in Naples, Fla., apparently felt Prime Time needed to be protected from an undercredentialed and underdressed fellow named David Dorsey, who claimed to be a reporter for the
Naples Fort Myers News-Press. Which is exactly what he is. Chaos briefly ensued, and we can only thank the stars that Deion's mom was around to sort everything out.
Here's the newspaper's account:
Around 1:30 p.m., Razilou and Officer Benjamin Vasquez were working security for the event when they were approached by a member of Sanders' staff who pointed out a man in a yellow shirt, dark shorts and a baseball cap who had attempted to enter the field three times to speak to Sanders. The staff member said he didn't know who the man was.
When the officers approached Dorsey, he identified himself with his driver license.
Dorsey said he worked for the News-Press and was there to speak with Sanders.
When the officers asked for additional identification, Dorsey said "let me see your ID."
He then handed over an electronic door-access card that said "Information Technology" on the front and "News-Press" on the back. The card didn't have his name.
The officers told Dorsey he wasn't allowed on the field, but he attempted to gain access again.
After the game, Dorsey pushed through the crowd and walked through the gate in Sanders' direction. When the officers attempted to handcuff Dorsey, he pulled away and struggled with them.
The officers removed Dorsey from the field in handcuffs. They released him only after Sanders' mother said he was allowed to be there.
The staff member who initially pointed Dorsey out to the officers cried when informed of the miscommunication.
Picture the scene: a lone reporter; a squadron of jack-booted thugs; a weeping factotum; an American flag overhead, snapping crisply in the Gulf Stream breezes (just guessing here); and, in the bleachers, Deion Sanders' mother, rising in righteous indignation to protect the Constitution the way her son used to patrol a defensive backfield, saying, "Enough!" It's like a Norman Rockwell painting, in neon.
Reporter handcuffed, News-Press threatens to sue Naples [Naples Daily News]For Bill Chaucer the title "King" appears to be permanent. First he ruled here as the Kind of Pericles, before donning his crown again the following year, this time as King of Omega. And it should be fairly remarked that he filled the crown and the title in true storybook fashion. This year, his kingdom expanding still farther, Chaucer has been announced as the King of Zeus.
And, you know, Rex isn't just the name of your neighbor's big pooch. Stay tuned . . .
Richard Stilley, meanwhile, is selling the most profoundly sweet berries to ever cross your lips. The Publisher brought a plate of the Ponchatoula berries to St. Albert in suburban Hammond and the wee ones, after the Mass was done, turned their noses skyward on their usual treasure of sweet donuts, wanting only the Ponchatoula berries, which they judged were far sweeter. Smart kids.
Please do read the Letter to the Editor (The Times loves all letters on all subjects, and respects them as your exercise of the First Amendment) on Page 4-A, from that wonderful Ponchatoula woman Miss Addie Morris. This is a great one and I'm betting she will get a letter of congratulations from John Russell or Registrar of Voters (don't disappoint me "Fat Rat").
Those grins on Garnett and Kathy Bedenbaugh's faces probably have nothing whatsoever to do with the recent birth of their 11th grandchild. Congratulations!

Monday-Friday: 6am-5pm / Saturday: 6am-11am / Sunday: 6am-1pmA Sioux Falls man stabbed his girlfriend 14 times in the chest, torso and back early Thursday before calling 911 with a plea for help, authorities said.
Michael Richard Martinez, 28, listened to step-by-step instructions from a dispatcher on how to tend to his girlfriend's puncture wounds.
By the time first responders arrived at the couple's eastern Sioux Falls apartment, though, Beverly Whitney Guerra, 21, was dead, Sioux Falls Police Lt. Matt Burns said.
Martinez now faces life in prison on charges of second-degree murder and first-degree manslaughter. He appeared in court Thursday and was being held on a $1 million cash-only bond.
The city's third homicide of 2014, police say the stabbing was the result of a domestic dispute. It happened about 2:30 a.m. Thursday at Willow Wood Apartments, 1612 S. Rock Creek Drive.
"It appears they were fighting – having a disagreement earlier in the evening," Burns said. "What precipitated the violent event, we can only speculate. It obviously got out of hand."
Two children, ages 3 and 6, were in another room in the apartment. The children, who were in Department of Social Services custody, belonged to Guerra but Martinez was not the father, police said.
There was no evidence that Martinez was intoxicated, police said. Police are talking with friends and family to see if there was a history of violence between the two. Neither party had filed a restraining order against the other, according to court records.
"We will continue to follow up with neighbors who may have lived close to the apartment," Burns said. "We will talk with family who may have had close contact with them to get a sense of what might have been the relationship with these two."
Martinez was arrested on first-offense DUI and drug charges in 2012, but the drug charges were dismissed. He was arrested on a carrying a concealed weapon charge in 2011 and paid a fine. In 2005, he was arrested on an aggravated assault charge, which was reduced to a disorderly conduct charge. He pled guilty but didn't serve any jail time.
Cassandra Miller, 24, of Sioux Falls, a former classmate of Guerra's at Joe Foss High School, said Guerra was a hard-working mother of three who would do anything for her kids.
"She was very energetic, outgoing and had a good heart," she said. "She was a great person and would do anything for her kids. I know she's in a better place, and her memory will always live on."
Miller said she had talked with Guerra about a month ago to organize a play date with all of their kids. Miller said Guerra loved shopping and hanging out with friends. Miller said she didn't know Martinez that well, but said the couple's relationship was difficult. According to his Facebook page, Martinez is from Miami, Fla., and went to high school in California.
Residents of the apartment complex where Guerra was killed received a note Thursday morning from the landlords explaining that a homicide had occurred and that a suspect was in custody. The police crime lab was on scene for most of the morning compiling evidence from the evidence and surveying the area.
"Our thoughts and prayers are with everyone involved in the incident," Lloyd Companies Regional Manager Nicholas Blau said in an emailed statement to the Argus Leader. "We are working closely with the police department to ensure the safety of our residences and we are assisting in anyway we can to complete the investigation."
Amy Carter, operations director for the Children's Inn, a private, non-profit organization for domestic abuse victims in Sioux Falls, said victims of domestic violence may not seek help if they feel shame or fear what the other person would do to them if they found it.
But keeping it a secret, can sometimes make it worse.
"What's so frightening about domestic violence, it escalates and gets worse," Carter said.
The homicide is the third in Sioux Falls in 2014. All three victims have been women.
>I don’t know about all your readers, but this reader is admittedly on information overload.
The really sad part is who or what to believe. In this presidential election alone, we will be bombarded with nearly $1 billion in campaign rhetoric, a staggering amount!
What could we have done with just half of that money if it went to a truly worthwhile and credible cause? Of course, there are those readers who will argue that all this crazy spending is worthwhile. Really?
The mere fact that it takes two years and $1 billion to elect a president speaks volumes about what our society has become — a polarized ideological populace that too frequently is looking to blame someone else for our problems.
The fear mongers drive these campaigns, by threats of socialism or being destroyed by the banks and big corporations. For God’s sake, can we just get the 15 percent on each end of the spectrum to just shut up and quit yelling Chicken Little slogans?
Our government is gridlocked in confrontation instead of cooperation. Political strategy is simply to divide and concur.
That is our fault, because we let it continue.

Elissa Sherley took a risk when she decided to change her song choice just 10 days out from Wollongong Eisteddfod.
The 12-year-old chose to perform Naughty from Matilda for the Musical Theatre in Costume Solo section on Thursday.
Elissa said the song had more scope for a performance than her previous choice, The Girl I Need to Be from The Secret Garden.
Full coverage of 2014 Wollongong Eisteddfod
"I like the character [who sings Naughty], she has attitude. I like her way of thinking, she makes things happen for herself," she said.
Aware of the short rehearsal period, Elissa's father Paul Sherley felt the nerves before she stepped on stage. But Elissa had her own way of making the butterflies fly in formation.
"I just think about singing to myself at home," she said.
Elissa first took to performing in front of her family, well qualified to provide feedback.
Elissa's eldest brother, James Sherley, launched a new music venue, Washed Out, in Wollongong's central business district last Friday.
But it isn't just her family's critique that Elissa values - performing is a lesson in itself.
"I learnt you should get up there and try," she said.
Mr Sherley agreed.
"The eisteddfod is a great opportunity for people to perform in front of an audience and get feedback," he said.
This is the second year running Elissa has won the section and her dream is to be in Matilda when she is older.Ralph Angenendt wrote: > Cheers. > > > > ------------------------------------------------------------------------ > > _______________________________________________ > CentOS mailing list > CentOS at centos.org > > Hi Ralph, As it happens I have a trip to Europe planned that will allow me to attend Linuxtag.

Insomnia feeds on the minor details of modern life, like the soft blue glow from a cell phone, PDA, or digital clock resting on your bedside table. The short waves of blue light interfere with sleep.I've always been on the outside of the (not-so) great "mommy debate" of working vs stay-at-home momdom, waving my Swiss flag because I have no idea what side to stand on. Do I have to pick a side?
It seems pretty obvious to me that the great majority of everyone is doing what they have to do to raise their kids happily and healthily, whether that means putting off career to focus on family or pursuing everything at once. Sides can go fuck themselves.
Regardless of the choices you or me or the chick standing behind you in line for coffee has made, we're all trying to achieve balance, to find happiness, to spread the love.
Behold:
"How do you do it all?" we constantly ask one another, seldom answering the question ourselves.
Perhaps because there's no answer. Because our circumstances are so different, constantly changing, that every day is its own unique experience. The amount of balls we have hovering in the air above us changes momentarily. Like right now, for instance?
It's late. Kids are sleeping. Husband's in the shower. I'm alone. I can blog and when I'm finished with this post I can clean up and eventually go to sleep* and maybe I don't sleep as much as I could but neither do you.
Because that's what happens when you have kids. Because that's what happens when you don't have kids. Because that's what happens when you work long hours. Because that's what happens when you're an adult and you have shit you'd like to do. You need to do. You have no choice but to do.
I can't speak for all mothers but I can speak for myself as a work-from-home-mom (WAHM) when I say that maintaining order in the court is not an everyday occurence. There are some days when I rock the shit out of my life - when I write ten pages in two hours, have dinner on the table by the time Hal's home from work, have kids down by 8:00pm, but six days out of the seven, I'm disasterville - the kids still wandering the halls at 10:30 and me struggling to write a blog post, bleary-eyed, teary-eyed and overwhelmed, Hal home from work to find me in a heap of drugs, gigolos and gambling debt.
This is is why starting this week we're hiring me a part-time helper. Because Fable doesn't nap and therefor I cannot work during the day. I tried "doing it all" without assistance but it didn't quite work, so ten hours a week I'll be working outside my home, writing at my neighborhood coffee shop. This is a good thing. This is necessary. For my sanity. And my creativity. And my career. For my kids. So that when I'm with them I'm not constantly looking over my shoulder envious of every laptop at the coffee shop I'm pushing my stroller through.
The pressure to perform as a writer and a mother and a wife and a friend and a daughter and a sister is nothing new.
I'm pretty sure that by day's end, we're all on the same side - managing stress, trying to achieve balance, striving as best we can to be be good, happy, well-adjusted peeps.
I mean, right?

When I first read this I thought to myself, "I wonder what it would be like to hire help?" And then I realized...DUH...I KIND OF DO. I don't have to pay her, but I do get help of the Grandma variety every single day. I am SUPER blessed to have my mother who is able to watch my son while I study for the GRE, run around teaching piano lessons (the thing I do because not enough people read my blog) and if I'm ever THAT TIRED, yeah. She's there. I think that Mom's everywhere could use a hand, some baby-free time, and some acknowledgment that honestly...we don't do it our own. I'm lucky enough to have family nearby and with enough time free to help out, but other people hire people to provide loving care to their kids. I happen to think that this teaches children how to trust, teaches them to behave in different situations and in the care of different people, and teaches them that their Mommy is hard-working and committed enough to have to "disappear" sometimes. More than all that, it teaches them that she always, always comes back. It's a good thing, for sure.

I just moved to a new town, Darwin, in the north of Australia. I have applied for a few jobs and had to turn them down because there is. Absolutely. No. Child. Care. in this town (there is a shortage of all skills because it's a remote city that noone wants to live in). So I am trying to think of ways to work from home... and I just don't know if I could do it without help, and I just have one baby!
Yes! Absolutely. I don't know how ANY of us do it, just that somehow we do--some days better, some days worse.
Even mothers that don't "work" are still working in my opinion. "Stay at home mom" is a job title. Cleaning the house, cooking dinner, watching after children are all "jobs" that other people can be hired to do.
Great post.
I just want to thank you for sharing such a balanced perspective on this issue sans-judgment-- I'm very tired of the whole, "You're a bad mom" "You're a bad woman" argument that arises when working-- at home or out of the home-- and motherhood get discussed. You do what you need to do. I do what I need to do. She does what she needs to do. Different contexts call for different actions. So, yeah. Thanks.
oooh i have to tell you that my first reaction to you hiring a nanny was....attitude. i shook my head and rolled my eyes. then, i realized it's more out of jealousy than anything else. i realized that i wouldn't feel that way if you worked outside of your home full time and put your kids in daycare for 45 hours a week. i just felt that way because sometimes i wish i had some help too.
go me- way to sort out my feelings on the quick, yo!
and go you! way to know what you need and actually get it.
Great post. My favorite - sides can go fuck themselves. Because it is hard. No matter what you do, SAHM, WAHM, work outside the home, finding any kind of balance between you, the kids, your partner is hard. Good for you for getting help.
I could not agree with your more. I want to know when Nanny or helper became such a bad word. I mean we are not the mothers who send the Nannies to saturday play dates because we need to get our nails done. No, we all struggle with the balance each and every day. If you need someone to help you to get it all done, then fine. Everyone needs to do what works for them. Besides, it is healthy for everyone for Mom to have some time to herself, it does keep us all sane. It took me nearly 2 years of motherhood to admit that without guilt, but it is true. Every can do it all on the terms that they set for themselves, not what your neighbor does, not what your mil says, but what you know is right in your mommy-gut.
Yeah - that's the thing when you work from home. I feel like we're sort of expected to keep producing work while at the same time raising a child in the same space. It's INSANELY difficult because you cannot leave your work - it's there next to you at all times.
I had some part-time help when I was working on the edits of Rockabye - same situation. I had deadlines and too much work to do JUST when Archer was napping and asleep. I was also working a night job at the same time 3 nights a week. It was insane.
Of course I wouldn't have it any other way and I AM SO INCREDIBLY BLESSED OMG but for me there is no way I can do everything without a little help. (Whoa, it was hard to just type that.)
I'm currently pregnant with our first baby and I work at home full-time. I'm really not sure how this is all going to go once my maternity leave is over...but you've given me some hope here!
All I can focus on is "Fable doesn't nap." How do you do it??? My 13 month old still takes two naps a day (at least 1 hour each) and they are my lifesaver. I can put away dishes, clean up the house and then put my feet up and read and relax. I would seriously go crazy without this break.
Enjoy the 10 hours a week. You need it!
I was the same way, Assertagirl. I've worked from home off and on since I was eighteen - made my living freelancing, copy-writing and was able to continue working full-time through Archer's infancy with no help miraculously enough. I have no idea how I did it but you will too. No doubt. And if you need to hire some part-time help? You do it. You make it work, Tim Gunn style.
Anon - Archer napped THREE HOURS twice a day. I kicked ass with that much work-time. Fable sleeps through the night amazing but cannot nap. I film Momversation with her in her highchair next to me. I write when I can on the porch with her playing on her play-mat, but the majority of my writing is done when she's asleep. Between the hours of 10-1am. This is why it's nanny time.
People often hear "work at home" and they think you are, I don't know, sitting on a divan eating parfaits and having foot massages. They do not understand why you can't bend your schedule to work with theirs; they frequently don't get that you really truly do WORK. My husband and I both work at home and when our daughter was smaller it was slightly more doable but as soon as she became mobile it became impossible. Now that she is 20 months it simply can't happen. I am a professional freelance artist/painter and I work on deadline. If my daughter is in the house, she wants me, wants my attention and wants to be in my workspace which is full of non-child-friendly materials. And if I don't make my deadline the work goes away. My work isn't mobile (not of the laptop at the coffee shop variety) so I have to be at home, and we can't even have a nanny in the house because we are already there. Would anyone at a law firm or a bank or advertising firm get anything done if their children were there? I don't think so. So yes!!!!! A nanny or daycare or whatever you feel is a happy safe situation for your child while you pay the bills or rent or mortgage and put food on the table is FINE. It doesn't matter where you work- you are still working and need undivided attention to get the job done.
I am 25 and just had my 3rd child in March. Not a day goes by when someone doesn't ask me 'how do you do it?' and honestly I don't know, I usually laugh and say with a lot of alcohol! But I guess us moms just know how to survive and pursue.
So, why do we put on these acts out in public like we all have our shit together?!
PS love your blog, just started reading it!
right.
I'm so glad I'm not the only one. I happily gave up my full-time hat as a newspaper editor when I had Baby No. 1 two years ago, opting to stay home and freelance instead. This was a trick with one baby, but since No. 2 came along three months ago, it's been damn near impossible. I WILL make it work, because it's just that important to me to be home with my boys but to not completely lose my identity as a professional and a writer (not to mention how I'd lose my sanity if I couldn't write...), but many many days I don't know how I'll do it.
I'm seriously busy 24 hours a day, and often when my husband gets home and I look around at the disaster that is our living space and the unfinished dinner on the stove and the baby fussing in my arms and the toddler running in frenetic circles around our table and the looming freelance deadline that I fear I might miss, I think "What the hell did I DO all day??" Because it's not like I'm sitting around watching Oprah and eating bon-bons. (OMG, if only....) Unfortunately we don't live anywhere close to family, so free babysitting is out. I'm jealous of your nanny-time, but it gives me hope that perhaps I can work out something similar. Good for you. I'll bet you'll be amazed at how much writing you accomplish in that time. ... probably a gazillion times more than you used to accomplish in the same amount of time, before kids.
i struggle with this so much more than i thought i would. i work from home 4 days a week (mon, wed, fri & sometimes sat) & on tue & thur i go in office, so i get that little break of just focusing on work. when i am at home, i work early in the morning, usually starting around 4am & then i work until aaron gets up around 7. i work when he takes his 2 naps in a day, & then i work when my husband comes home & usually work before i go to bed, crashing around 10 or 1030p. during the day is all about aaron, aaron, house work, cooking, husband, aaron. i do it all practically & has been that way since i went back to work after maternity leave.
i often feel i am neglecting my work for him & him for my work. i don't know if i've found a "balance" or just what works for me. am i exhausted? yes. am i lucky to be able to work from home? yes. am i grateful that my boss is a good guy? yes. am i happy to be able to help support my family? yes. do i ever wish i could nap during the day or that my husband would do the laundry? yes.
i agree with you that it is hard to balance career, kids & house, not to mention hubby's feelings & immediate/extended family.
i feel your words, girl...probably more than what you know.
p.s.
your word verification just asked me to type in "unbras" fitting, non?
I love this post----you are SO right.
The other morning, I didn't do anything on the computer, just made phone calls for summer camp, for the exterminator, a doctor's appt, etc. I called about an incorrect bill. I made a shopping list b/c we were out of everything. I did laundry and fed the kids and unloaded the dishwasher. None of this was for my paying job, it was all part of being a mom. And it sure felt like work to me.
That's great that you'll get some help soon. I hope that time to write is wonderful.
i work two hours a week teaching at a yoga studio - just to preserve my nerves.
but as a SAHM, sometimes there is pressure to be super housekeeper, chef, lover extraordinaire. but i'm in my 30's and i've just reconciled the fact that i am NOT now, nor will i EVER be superwoman. and that's ok.
I loved this Momversation episode. And I loved this post. And I love that you will have 10 more hours a week to blind us with your brilliant writing.
I look at other women all the time and think, "How do they do it all?" Because I REALLY don't do it all. I don't even do half of it. But there are probably people looking at me thinking I do it all.
Anne Lamott talks about "comparing your insides to other people's outsides" and I think a lot of that goes on with mothers and work. We compare how we feel to what we see other people doing (and what we interpret that to mean), and we can end up beating ourselves up over not matching up to what we imagine someone else's life is like. Or is that just me?
Anyway. Great topic, great post.
that's awesome. you deserve it. enjoy every minute and don't feel guilty at all. it's good for everyone.
I'm extra motivated to find freelancing gigs because if I can start making enough money I might be able to afford a part-time nanny. That way I could be a WAHM, have tons of time with my babe, and maybe not be a complete nut job, such as I am now trying to work without childcare. Kudos to you reaching "make it work time."
I JUST had an almost mental collapse about this very topic. We recently got a puppy, and two days later returned it to its previous owners (who were so understanding an awesome, thank god). I told everyone it was the puppies personality and that it didn't like us (which is somewhat true), I said finances were too tight (we could have *squeezed* him in), but in reality- I just couldn't handle him and my son all day. I cried and cried over that fact- that I just couldn't do it all. I want to be the girl with the most cake...
Between my son and balancing my passions and finding a new job, I just couldn't forsee a happy life for that puppy. And as hard as it was to accept that, it was a lesson to me to KNOW my limits. To not spread myself so thin that everything is half-assed.
I still wish I could do it all, but for now I can just do my best.
I'm just transitioning into this whole WAHM situation. My daughter is almost 5 months old and I'm doing some freelancing now -- I'm trying to find this balance & I thin it will. To start, it's a little stressful -- but you're right -- work means SO much to me and I want to do it.
I will I can etc. etc.
The thought of working outside of my home seems really awful to me -- I don't want to leave her, so you're damn right I'm going to make this work ^_^
Right on Rebecca! First off, congrats ongetting help. You're totally going to rock those 10 hours.
You definitely hit on a great topic. It seems like this is such a universal concern for moms. How do we strike a balance between very real, demanding work of mothering and our own individual needs. Before I had a baby, I never thought I'd be any kind of conflicted about this. I grew up with an unapologetic working mom. I figured I'd be the same.
Then I actually had a baby.
Our situation is slightly different. My husband and I are both touring musicians. We both play in the same band, and we decided to stay on the road after we had our baby. We took her out on her first tour when she was six weeks old and we've been traveling ever since.
On the one hand, we both get to spend loads of time with our daughter. When we're on tour we're always together. When we're not on the road, we're totally off. We get to be
part time stay at home parents.
But, you know, our baby has already traveled over 15,000 miles. She's five and a half months old. And in the bad moments I can't help but think maybe we're doing the wrong thing.
Maybe I should just shut it down, get off the road, and raise my baby in one place.
But I love to play music. And I love to travel. And I love being with my husband. And in my good moments I believe that happy parents make for happy kids.
I have't talked to a woman yet who doesn't struggle with her post-baby decision about herself. Work, don't work, get a nanny, do day care...there's just not a simple or perfect solution. I'm just trying to stay happy. And I guess we'll see.
Read blogs......no not me....My text aloud reads it as i do the dishes.
Oooh!! You lucky girl! Enjoy the helper freedom. That sounds like bliss. Even if I couldn't write a single legible word during my 2 hour breaks at a coffee shop, I would still LOVE to try it out!
GREAT idea Rebecca.
I'm just like that too, sometimes I can't believe how fantastically on top of things I am, and sometimes I just want to curl up on the floor and cry. It's great to see that we're not alone!
You're rocking it, working mom, WFHM, whatever. Those are just labels.
It always makes me so happy when I see moms coming together to support one another's decisions. I do day care from home, which lets me be home with the kids, but probably as importantly, it's the only way we could afford to have three of them. And often I get the impression that people don't think I actually "work." I mean, I just stay at home with a bunch of kids, right? How is it that I couldn't do the laundry, call the plumber, pay the bills, and start supper? (They're eating breakfast now, while I take the chance to read a blog or two and maybe take a couple of sips of coffee!)
And at the same time, I get some day care parents (usually moms) who feel extremely guilty about sending their kids, especially when they work at home. They think that the whole point of working at home is so that they can take care of their kids at the same time. But at some point, often around a year, they realize that they can't be good, engaged parents and be professional, effective employees in the same moment. You can do both, but not actually at the same time.
You've talked before about the moms at the playground and the other places where it feels like moms are always judging one another. I think we all feel that. It's so great to see you (and all your wonderful readers) taking the chance to support one another's choices instead.
Thanks for the post. I'm a teacher who is a mother to a three-year old and a three-month old. I have my summers off so I get a taste of both worlds. I'm happy with my choice. I need to work to maintain my happiness, but I also get lots of "breaks" with those summer vacations and holidays that drop throughout the school year to be the stay-at-home mom as well. We all do what we feel is best for our families. For us that means dad stays home two days a week during the school year and the kids go to their "school" for three days. There are times when I want to pull my hair out as I'm grading papers at 11 p.m. but we make it work. What I hate about the choice I have made is that some people want me to feel guilty about it. I don't see why we have to pick sides either. Sides suck.
I work out of the home and have a 3 yr old and a 1 yr old in daycare (and weekly cleaner). I had always 100% fully assumed that work at home moms had at least 20 hours of babysitting (paid, unpaid, split parenting whatever). I'm actually pretty flabberghasted at the idea of all these prolific bloggers getting anything done without help- but then again, my 3 yr old has always been higher maintenance so I guess I started out from different reference point.
Good for you, for hiring help! You're a smart, lucky woman. When I had our first baby, my husband and I decided that I would be a SAHM. Because I absolutely WANTED to, but also because it made the most sense; realistically, with the cost of childcare - we couldn't AFFORD for me to go back to work. I'd be busting my ass to bring home *maybe* a couple hundred dollars per month. Totally not worth it. Now, I have 2 children and I'm still blessed to be a SAHM. Because Mama needs a bit of "me time", and I'd like to at least feel like I'm trying to contribute financially, I've started an Etsy store to try and make a bit of money on the side. But for any energy I put into this little business, my housework/"wifely duties" lack elsewhere. When friends ask "how do you do it?!", I laugh and tell them, "I don't!". I honestly tell them - the sink is stacked with dishes, I've got dirty laundry up to my ears, and I nearly break an ankle every day tripping over toys. My children and I spend way too much time in our pyjamas, and I usually don't shower until everyone has gone to bed - because honestly, I'm just going to end up covered in spit-up and peanut butter anyway, so why bother? When I leave the house it may *look* like I have my shit together, but I struggle to get everything done, just like everyone else. There's no need to pretend that I can "do it all", because really - I can't!
I have my days where I wish I was a WAHM, and then there are days when I think that working at home would be so much harder than the status quo (9 month old spends 40 hours a week at daycare).
This fall, thanks to the expense issue, I'll be a WAHM 2 days a week. Not sure how well that will go.... I'm pretty nervous. And simultaneously, happy that I will be spending more time with my son. What a mixed bag.
I'm not a mom yet, but am trying desperately to confince my husband to agree to start trying. He has agreed to May 2010, and I can't wait. This post just hit home for me and I have no idea why! I just adore your outlook on life and your free spirited nature. I love that you are getting help 10 hours a week and can admit you can't do it all. I know far too many moms who just won't admit it and I see them unravel more everyday pretending to try. We all do what we have to do and fit the jobs and the kids and the life shit all into one day. I feel like if you can do it all, one day so can I! And I'm obsessed with your word plays, HA!
writing one-armed w/baby girl, elke, 3 mos, in my lap... so i understand. my son was just like yours. slept 2 long naps a day. new baby, not so much. took off year from creative writing mfa, just to work on freelance jobs because - how can i do it all? answer: i can't. not with out help. this time, i started with a sitter twice a week, which is great. honestly, it's always better having more people in your kids' lives. for instance, my best friend taught my son how to ice skate. when he tried with me, he just got annoyed and frustrated. with her... he focused! good luck to you, you're wonderful!
Stumbled here awhile back - I love your blog.
I am an adjunct professor at a community college, and until very recently, also worked PT at a bookstore. I basically worked Sunday - Weds. Even though on paper it sounds like a great schedule, I was slowly going nuts trying to find time to concentrate on so many disparate jobs while preparing to return to school and devoting time to mommying.
So I jettisoned the bookstore job and on Thursdays my little girl goes to daycare so that I have a day to myself.
Modern life is about a constant striving toward balance - not everyone finds balance in the same way, and what is adequate at one point in life will change as YOU change and your children change. So the best we can do is keep trying. And acknowledge that EVERYONE is just trying. You deserve time off - you'll be a better YOU and thereby a better mommy for it.
Thank you for this post. I hate the SAHM/WAHM vs. Work-outside-of-home debate. Really. I do.
I get asked frequently how I do it all, some by SAHMs, moms with one child(and that's still alot, don't get me wrong), and women who aren't moms. I work 30 hrs a week outside of the home, I have a budding photography business that I would love to make my WAHM career, I have three kids (7, 5, and 3) and I'm pregnant with #4. And I have my husband too.
Sometimes the question isn't of amazement, but seems more of a critical nature. To those, I tell them that my kids are smart, outgoing and they don't have to want for food and clothing, whether if it comes from Gap, Target, ebay, or Wal-Mart.
When I get asked how do I manage it all, I don't know, I just do. I have to. My life revolves around my kids, but I have to be able to support them too. Because my mom was single and received government assistance, and it was miserable and sad to not have groceries at the end of the month. And I dare not let my kids know that feeling. Ever.
My life isn't consumed by T.V. watching, but I will sure let T.V. watch my kids from time to time so I can get some things done. I love to cook for my family and we don't do every activity under the sun. I've learned kids need realistic play time and I need my sanity to not bounce from activity to activity with no time for family meals.
I'm not the perfect mom, I get tired & cranky, I get overwhelmed with work, kids fighting, bills, spousal frustration, just like every mom I know, whether SAHM or not.
Being a mother is the most rewarding(and energy-zapping) job, and if I could have my way, I would work less but life(nor the lottery) has not afforded me the opportunity. It's healthy for my kids to be around other people and I feel validated when people come up to me and tell me that my kids are so outgoing and sociable and funny as hell. I think that has a little to do with them not being under my feet every second of every day and letting them learn how to socialize and mingle.
I say to all mommas, we all need to support one another. I don't care where you work, if you work, if you never work. We all deal with the same frustrations as mommies and it's a universal feeling. What I don't like is the imaginary line drawn in the sand over who is/can/will be a better mom for being a SAHM, WAHM, or WOTH(work outside the home) mom. We are in this together and it's difficult. We shouldn't make this harder than it is. I give props to all mommas, even those that can pay a sitter/nanny to give them a much needed 2-hour break! Thanks GGC for the post! Have a great week!
"Motherhood is not for the weak. Pansies need not apply."
You had me at gigolos! That word cracks me up. Isn't there some 80's song about gigolos and the buffalo stance? What is that?
You're great. :) Keep workin' hard fellow mama!
i think the truth is, people used to live near family and family helps with kids. we are not meant to be alone raising our kids and i am not sure where the idea of getting help, paid or not, being bad comes from.
i not only have a nanny but also a cleaning lady because i need them. i just flat out do-and hopefully i will be ok with that someday.
Okay-- I don't want to come off as being age-ist here but I really feel like the whole mommy wars between SAHMs, WAHMs & WOHMs is something I hear older generations talk more about.
I'm a newer mom (2 year old son) and most of my friends are starting to have children too. Some of us work outside the home, some stay home, some work at home.... and it's really not a big deal.
You're right when you say that we're all just doing what it takes to raise healthy & happy families... and we each do it differently.
I appreciate the continued conversation about this but can't we all just agree to support each others decisions and if not, keep our mouths shut?
Thanks for your great blog!
There's nothing wrong with hiring part-time help. Heck, I live four houses away from my parents and do you think I'm not going to milk that for all its worth?! NOT A CHANCE! This kid is going to get plenty of grandparent time if only for my own sanity.
I hope those 10 hours a week help out. I'm sure they will, but I hope you get out of them more than you expect to =)
I think the "debate" largely starts with out own self criticism and then we turn on each other. Seriously, how many men are sitting around feeling like they are crappy at each role they fill? Sure, some do, but women generally and especially moms are harder on themselves than anyone else I know. I really do want to strive for these high goals of involved parenting and self fulfillment and perhaps being nice to my husband and getting self satisfaction from my work that I find meaningful and every now and then I'd like to read a book and knit a sweater and watch a chick flick and go out for some live music and on and on, and damned if I don't kick myself all the time when I can't quite pull it all together. And If I wasn't being critical of myself, and the rest of the moms weren't either, we might have the time and energy to be supportive of one another.

i have no time for this debate.
we do what we do. and thats that.
so succinctly put and a step towards not having so much judgement in the world.

Totally right!
Amen.
Rebecca,
This hit at such the right time for me. I'm a longtime reader but don't comment much . . . to save time. Like a lot of other commenters, I work from home (primarily) and outside the home (about 30%, I'd guess). Like another, I'm an adjunct professor working at three institutions, and trying to balance the insanity of commutes, three different sets of protocol, paperwork, and the like makes me crazy. My husband works nights, so the only time I can work is at night -- once I've put the 20-month-old down. He doesn't nap much, and working with him during the day is pretty much an impossibility. Since he still doesn't sleep through the night and often gets up four or five times, you can imagine how much I get done in those hours. Recently, I've stayed up as late as 4 a.m. because of deadlines . . . and get up at 7. It's nuts. I've called my husband crying, begging him to come home to be on "Reed duty" in case he gets up so I can actually work. I've had him call in sick so I can get work done. As the breadwinner in a big way, I HAVE to get it done, but my husband can't stay home full-time because we can't afford it. It's the fucking proverbial Catch 22.
I hear so often from others that they'd "love to work at home", and the prevailing opinion seems to be, as a previous commenter so aptly put it: "People often hear "work at home" and they think you are, I don't know, sitting on a divan eating parfaits and having foot massages." Tis true. Makes me crazy. Yet, I find myself doing the judgy judgerson thing when my SAHM friends complain about being tired or not having enough time, wanting to shout, "You only have ONE job! Being a stay-at-home mom! And yes, you have to cook and clean and do laundry and blah blah blah, but I have to do these things to AND work over 40 hours a week! And blah, blah, blah.
We've thought of getting some help recently, and I haven't wanted to admit that this probably needs to happen. I do have a friend who watches Reed here and there, and I pay her, but it's not working out as I thought it would. Thanks for making me see that getting the help I need is the right thing to do rather than a, I don't know, ode to the white flag on a sinking ship. Your decision sounds like a good one, and 10 hours a week is nothing -- if you break it down, you're gone an hour or two per day (except it's consolidated into two days). It will be so good for you.
Your posts really help me sometimes, so I just wanted to say thanks. Sorry for the verbal diarhhea . . .too much caffeine to stay up and work. :)
HELL YES. I have never gotten less done than the times I've been home with my children ( a year each) because they just don't leave you time and energy and free hands to accomplish those projects you'd like or need top work on.
And as far as the whole "mommy wears" BS, I think it's so much from people feeling insecure and judged, and taking a defensive stance on it. If they were easy with their choice and felt accepted, they would, I think, be fine with other people's other choices ( or needs, as may be).
ok, i could have wrote this same exact post this week. i am in the same position as you. i work from home with my 3 month old. i also have a 3 year old who goes to preschool 3 days a week. but i thought i could get plenty of time to work even with the baby home. turns out, babies need a lot of attention. hmm...didn't see that coming. anyway, my husband has been telling me for weeks now to get a mother's helper or babysitter just for a few hours a week for the baby but i kept saying to myself, why should i? other moms can do it, why can't i? well, even if other moms can, i can't. maybe it's me, maybe it's my high maintenance kids, let's just go with that. but either way, i got a babysitter starting next week. phew. i just feel the weight lifting off my shoulders as i'm writing this. good to know i'm not the only one out there.
aw right on, good for you (doing what you need to do and working outside of the home)!
Delurking here (finally!)....I couldn't agree with you more! I also find that other people don't take the fact you are "working" at home seriously....like somehow it's not a real job. You do a truly awesome job at making us feel "not alone" - thank you!
You're only gonna be 28???? Happy Birthday - you just SEEEEEEM so much more wise and mature (for lack of a better word) than 28. Damn. I feel old.
AMEN!!!
This is the first time I've seen your blog - and I visited solely based on your Little House On The Praire outfit and braids that you wore during your last momversation. Did you lose a bet? Regardless, you are DARLING! I will visit more often and I love the names of your children...Keeping it mellow and relaxed this weekend. Soft, gentle shades.
The past few weeks have been very busy here. My husband has had two trips abroad and we have been racing to complete my studio in preparation for something I will share with you at a later date. I have also been working with my web designer to revamp and relaunch my site. I am delighted to say that it has today gone live. I have now added fabrics and some gorgeous keepsake boxes which are made for us here in Britain.
The weather here today is simply beautiful, what a wonderful time of year this is. Each new day brings more flowers into the garden. I think May must be one of my favourite months.

Happy Weekend
xxxOur editor at large Derek Blasberg has taken his roving title all the way to Africa this week for a safari in Botswana and Namibia, where Internet access is all but forbidden, therefore leaving us his sartorial wand to cast. As guest editor of his weekly list, I took it upon myself to honor some of my all-time favorite "girl crushes," who really turned it on this week. From glam gowns with plunging necklines and slits up to there — like Diane Kruger and Rosie Huntington-Whiteley delivered (in Yves Saint Laurent and Gucci, respectively) — to more attainable outfit inspiration — Liv Tyler's blue Stella McCartney shift and Kirsten Dunst's camellia-print Miu Miu tea dress had me mentally dusting off some similar shapes stored away in my closet — this week's scene-stealing looks were all-girl. And the British set, as always, taught me a few lessons in the power of personal style. Bride-to-be Kate Moss put a ladylike spin on Isabel Marant's striped pirate pants, while Alexa Chung won my heart for her confident take on a cutesy polka-dot church dress. Sienna Miller roughed up a white lacy Ralph Lauren dress with black booties and a messy ponytail, proving that adding your own signature touches is the key to never looking cliché.

A blog post on the First Things web site some time ago was drawn to my attention by a couple colleagues as we were eating lunch the other day. A perceptive remark was made about it. The article, by a LCMS pastor, is rather typical of what the Roman Catholic journal, First Things, loves to publish: hand-wringing articles by Lutherans over the Reformation.
In the article, the pastor opines that the better color for Reformation Sunday would be a color of mourning, rather than a festive red. He laments the Reformation as a tragedy. He is correct, but for the wrong reason.
Must we lament our sin? Indeed. Must we lament our human pride? Yes! Is the Church always in need of Reformation? Absolutely. Is God, by His Most Holy Word and Sacraments constantly reforming you, me and the whole Christian Church on earth? Amen, Amen, may it ever be so! But, should we lament the fact of the Reformation? No, unless we wish to lament Gods gift of the Gospel, which came breaking through with great clarity once more at this time.
Ironically, though,!
Concord where it counts does not come about by the sword or by the edicts of men.
Given what has happened to the Episcopal church, soon the UMC and the ELCA, why would one regard the Reformation as anything but tragic?
“The Roman Catholic Church, as such, was formed”
Absolutely one-hundred percent rubbish. If they weren’t trying to reform the Catholic church then what the heck were they trying to reform?
You are aware that Luther et all were all Catholic priests.
The Reformation is about correcting abuses, not endorsing them.
Here’s the article. It’s not written by a Catholic for a Catholic either... First Things is protestants although obviously the ‘wrong kind’ of protestant. ;)
Timothy George is a Southern Baptist. Maybe you should try checking your facts next time.
So we should expect to see a reform of the reformation to correct stuff like this?
LOL! How ironic - you posted the wrong article. And have you seen First Things' masthead ads? What was that you were saying about fact-checking?
Absolutely!! Actually, those who espouse a reformed understanding of the Scriptures would deem this organization just as cultish as Rome. It is as despicable and false representation of the Gospel as Rome promulgates when it claims the seven sacraments, sacerdotalism, indulgences, purgatory, papalism, icons, genuflecting, pater nosters, mariolatry, and so forth, have any basis in biblical reality.
The message of the Gospel rediscovered in the Reformation was that salvation is by grace, through faith, and that not of yourselves, it is a gift of God, not by any action on man's part, lest a man boast. There is the Reformation needed everywhere, and all the time: Jesus is the One who is the Author and Finisher of faith.
A real reformation was probably impossible given the entrenched corruption of the clergy. So long as this unscriptural arrangement existed it would be a self serving class seeing its self above the ordinary Christian.
So a post by a Lutheran pastor and another post by a Southern Baptist equates with First Things being a Catholic site?
Interesting logic there. Anyhoo, it would have been great rather than posting the worthless blogpimp analysis of the article, if you actually posted the first thing article.
“have any basis in biblical reality.”
If you believe in scripture alone, why do you remain with a tradition that dates back no earlier than Luther?
Would it not make sense to go with what was actually written in the bible and not what the new tradition chose to keep?
The Reformation will not have its end of correcting abuses until the Last Day. That is its nature and purpose, so one would not expect to see it reform itself, any more than one would expect Truth to change and still be Truth.
the tragedy of the “reformation” was that is was rather a revolution. Luther had neither the authority nor the ability to reform anything in the Catholic Church. He did, however, have the ability to revolt against her, which he did. The result of his meddling, and convincing people that it was alright to do so,is the 20,000 or so “denominations” all of which think that they are correct and following the teachings of Christ......they are neither.
"We should preach the Word, but the results must be left solely to Gods good pleasure . . . I opposed indulgences and all the papists, but never with force. I simply taught, preached, and wrote Gods).
Would it not make sense to go with what was actually written in the bible and not what the new tradition chose to keep?"
Advocacy for a "tradition", any tradition, was the problem which the Reformers identified. There is no "tradition". The Scriptures teach that those among the elect are saved by grace, through faith, and that not of oneself, it is a gift of God, not by works (as Rome advocates), lest any man boast. Check it out...Ephesians 2, Rom. 3 & 5, Col. etc. It is everywhere in the NT epistles, but suppressed by Rome for centuries.
If the Reformation were sincerely the vanguard of Christ - why then do we see the ECLA and the Episcopal church supporting gay marriage.
Which scriptures? What do you consider scripture? Which books, Dutchboy?
I certainly agree that denominationalism is no solution. A simple reading of the Scriptures was all the original reformers intended, an act the RCC suppressed. Today’s “Lutheranism” would not even approximate the views Luther found in the Scriptures. Read Bondage of the Will and compare it to today’s liberal “lutherans”. Not even close.

This was fantastic. I made it two nights in a row.However the second time I just used vanilla pudding instead of making the custard. This was very good.
Sorry to say but the custard did not taste good and had a grainy texture.
37 Ratings.
excellent! very good and easy. One thing that i must let everyone know is that when your making the custard you can not! stop stirring or it will scorch! continuously stir this please or it wont turn out! dont bake ouyr crust and put your custard on when its still warm because if you let it cool it will thicken too much and it wont spread well. But other than that it was great and i've made it 3 times!
This recipe brought me a lot of praise, and it is a very refreshing summer dessert. I was pressed for time, so I used 2 (3.4oz.) pkgs of instant french vanilla pudding instead of making the custard. I also added strawberries on top of the bananas, and used oreo cookie crumbs instead of the graham crackers crumbs and real whip cream. It was delicious. My husband wants me to make it again tonight. French vanilla pudding mix. I chilled the crust a bit before putting the mix on top and also let the pudding set a bit before putting in on the crust and nuts OH MY that was a great addition. I will make this again for sure it’s a delicious and light summer dessert. I'm glad I found it!!!

The Minister for Children Frances Fitzgerald launched Ireland’s first National Poisons Awareness Day.
Developed by the National Poisons Information Centre at Beaumont Hospital, the day is intended to increase awareness of the dangers of poisons, especially to very young children, of the steps to take to avoid those dangers and what to do if someone has taken something which could be poisonous.
To mark the day the Minister was presented with a storybook, “Say NO to Poisons!”, when she attended Early Childhood Ireland’s conference in Dublin. The book has been developed by the National Poisons Information Centre at Beaumont Hospital with the assistance and support of the staff and children of County Carlow VEC Childcare Centre, the Health Service Executive and Early Childhood Ireland.
The book is one element in a learning and teaching resource being made available to daycare centres and preschools throughout Ireland. It is attractively illustrated by Louise Osborne.
Speaking at the launch NPIC Director Dr. Edel Duggan said that every year the Centre received over 4,000 enquiries concerning young children who had been involved in a poisoning incident.
“Our aim,” she said, “is to educate young children about potential poisons both inside and outside the home, and to help them understand that they should always ask an adult if something is safe to eat or drink.”
Dr Duggan said many people had been involved in developing the new education resource, including Martina Osborne of County Carlow VEC’s Adult and Further Education Office and Nicola Cassidy of the NPIC, who had instigated and driven the project.
As part of its national awareness day NPIC is also keen to ensure that parents and all those with responsibility for looking after children know exactly what to do if they suspect an incident has occurred.
“A quick phone call to our information centre will ensure swift access to the information required. Very often a child will not need to visit a hospital or doctor and we can provide reassurance. But where urgent action is required we can give that information too,” Dr Duggan said. “We would urge everyone to store our number in their phone – 01 809 2166. The line is open from 8 am in the morning to 10 pm at night, seven days a week.”
Fiona McDonnell, HSE Early Years Service said reducing risk of harm from accidental injury was a major area of focus within child health services. The HSE was delighted to support this initiative, she said. “We hope that children, parents and care workers will all benefit from the health education messages provided as part of this programme.
Early Childhood Ireland’s CEO, Irene Gunning, emphasised that young children are naturally curious and could inhale or swallow
poisonous substances without realising the danger. “This can be anything from household detergents to prescribed medicine, which in a child’s mind could be colourful sweets or goodies,” she said.
“The safety of children in our care is top of the agenda for our members and we are happy to do our bit by spreading the word through this story book and by giving the “Say No to Poisons” campaign a platform at our conference. Following simple basic safety rules will help encourage a reduction in the numbers of young children ingesting harmful or poisonous substances, which would be a positive outcome all round.”

The secret to having strong bones later lies in the choices you make now.
Exercise for a stronger skeleton
7. GET ON YOUR FEET Weight-bearing activities—from walking and running to jump-roping and dancing—are some of the most efficient ways to build bone density.
“They place a higher load on your muscles, tendons and bones, which respond by getting stronger,” explains Nicholas DiNubile, M.D., a clinical assistant professor of orthopedic surgery at the University of Pennsylvania and author of FrameWork: Your 7 Step Program for Healthy Muscles, Bones & Joints (Rodale). Weightlessness is the reason that astronauts lose up to 30 percent of their bone mass in four to six months in space. And zero-impact activities like bicycling and swimming don’t build bone: One study found that competitive male cyclists actually had lower bone density than nonathletes.
8. PUMP IRON Strength training is the best kind of weight-bearing exercise. “It gives you the best bang for your buck,” DiNubile says. Be sure to log at least two weight-lifting sessions per week, each lasting long enough (45 minutes to an hour) to target all of your major muscle groups and core. Moves that utilize your own body weight, like push-ups and lunges, work, too.
9. TAKE UP TAI CHI Several studies have demonstrated that tai chi slows bone loss. It’s also been shown to decrease production of the inflammatory stress hormone cortisol, a steroid. “High levels of steroids over time can increase the risk of osteoporosis,” says David Rakel, M.D., director of the University of Wisconsin-Madison School of Medicine and Public Health’s Integrative Medicine Program.Webfonts Week: An Interview with Bryan Mason of Typekit
This year’s ATypI’s gathering, deemed Typ09, was clearly different from previous years for many reasons. First, Mexico City provided a vibrant, new world backdrop for a conference that is usually held in Europe. Second, the main program was held on a single track in a presentation hall that is anything but conventional. But most palpable was the feeling among all attendees that the way fonts are licensed and used is about to change forever. 2009 will be remembered as the year that introduced tenable standards and methods for using non-system fonts on the Web.
During the conference I sat down with some of the key players who are leading the way as we head into the brave new world of web typography. Those video interviews will appear here on The FontFeed all week.
Our first installment is with Bryan Mason, whose
soon-to-launch [update: just launched Nov. 10] Typekit service offers an innovative model in which subscribers pay a monthly fee for access to a library of embeddable fonts, as well as a simple, intuitive method for including them on a website.

Phillip Leonard Sirotkin was born in Moline, Illinois, on Aug. 2, 1923. He married Cecille Sylvia Gussack on May 1, 1945, and they had two children: Steven and Laurie. He received his B.A. from Wayne State University in 1945, his M.A. in 1947 and his Ph.D. in 1951, both from the Universtiy of Chicago.
Sirotkin was a lecturer at the University of Chicago (1949-50), an instructor (1950-52) and an assistant professor of political science (1953-57) at Wellesley College, associate director of Western Interstate Commission on Higher Education, Boulder, Colorado (1957-60), executive assistant to the director of the California Department of Mental Hygiene (1960-63), assistant director of the National Institute of Mental Health (1964-66), associate director of NIMH (1967-71) and a consultant at NIMH (1971-73), executive vice president for academic affairs at the State University of New York at Albany (1971-76), and executive director of Western Interstate Commission for Higher Education, Boulder, Colorado (1976-).
Back to table of contents
In 1967, Philip Sirotkin, while associate director of the National Institute of Mental Health, was part of the First U.S. Mission on Mental Health to the U.S.S.R. In February 1969, the Mission published its report. Three years later, the New York Review of Books published a series of articles on the Soviet Union's commitment of dissidents to mental institutions. R. B. Silvers, editor of the New York Review of Books, wrote letters to all seven members of the Mission requesting that they respond to documents supporting this claim.
The papers contain correspondence sent to Sirotkin as a member of the Mission, documents in English translation (including reports by Soviet officials on the mental health of people accused of crimes against the state, statements by people who had been confined in Soviet mental institutions, and appeals from prominent Soviet dissidents such as Alexander Solzhenitsyn and V. N. Chalidze on behalf of those confined), articles about Soviet dissidents who were sent to mental institutions, and a note'about the authenticity of the Soviet documents by Peter Reddaway.

-A Massachusetts social gaming start-up is about to go big-time by adding the NFL brand to its online PC game.
Quickhit, a free-to-play browser based coaching game will boast all 32 NFL teams, their uniforms, logos and stadiums come this fall. The game doesn’t have a deal for all the NFL players but users can have access to five current players such as Randy Moss and can pay for classic players like Barry Sanders and Randall Cunningham.
While the game should turn heads, equally intriguing is the licensing arrangement with the NFL. The league has an exclusive contract with Electronic Arts for all console, PC and hand-held NFL games. But it’s unclear if it applies to online-based games, which may be how Quickhit was able to get the NFL license.
Quickhit CEO Jeff Anderson, a former EA employee, wasn’t able to shed light on the negotiations but he said he was excited about getting to play with NFL teams.
“I was at EA and saw the value and the power of the franchise. It is the most popular sport out there,” Anderson said. “Having the NFL and getting that validation is an incredible opportunity to bring in new users and expand our content.”
Quickhit got going in October and managed to rack up 1 million users. Played in a more casual style, players assemble their teams and send in plays, which their players execute for them. Your team’s accomplishments win you experience points.
Anderson said the game should appeal to people who love the NFL but find a game like Madden NFL too complicated and hard to control.
The new NFL content will go live with the upcoming 2010 season this fall.UPDATED: Mark Kassen (Puncture) is set to star in indie feature Alone, about Freeman, a 35-year-old veteran battling PTSD who finds kindness and comfort in the company of a rebellious New York City high school student, much to her father’s dismay.

About South East London
South East London area includes five boroughs which are Bexley, Bromley, Greenwich, Lewisham and Southwark. They are divided as well into smaller parts with their own postcodes to be easier for managing. Undoubtedly the most famous area in this part of the city is Greenwich and its Royal Observatory, founded in 1675 by Charles the Second. Near the Observatory are placed the National Maritime Museum and the Queen’s House. In 2012 the three buildings became a part of the Royal Museums Greenwich. The English maritime heritage and its importance to the world’s trade are honored in the National Maritime Museum. The exhibits include early plans for the Rotherhithe Tunnel and remains of a Zeppelin shot down over the river Thames back in 1916.
Very serious topics are covered by one of the museum’s galleries. Your Ocean Gallery reveals the current issues that affect marine conservation such as over- fishing, pollution and global warming. The observatory features six astronomy galleries and working horology center. The Time Galleries are drawing a map of the constant striving of the humanity, presented by astronomers and horologists, to pin down the elusive concept of time. The Peter Harrison Planetarium is open to the public with its 120 seats and presents a tour through the night sky with an astronomer of the Royal Observatory. Interesting exhibit is the 4.5 billion year old meteorite. As a part of the Observatory is a bronze cone tilted at 51.5 degrees latitude of Greenwich that points to the North Star.EXCLUSIVE ROLE: Lead CRA/Project Manager – Emerging sponsor – Thames Valley, UK

Administration:
They are strict about all the wrong things.
Off-Campus Housing:
It is hard to find off-campus housing that is connected to the school.
Party Scene:
We aren't allowed to have party's.
Off-Campus Dining:
Delivery is basically only Chinese food and pizza which can get annoying. If you go downtown Silver Spring you can find a couple of different places to eat.
Scholarships:
It was a long wait
Campus Food:
The food they serve is vegetarian, so if you are a meat eating and you change to that you would not really like it
Campus Housing:
Living on campus is a great opportunity because everything is right there. Even though you may want to be alone sometimes there are places you can go but there are always people there that can help you with your work or talk about life with. It may cost a lot to live on campus but if you add up gas and food when living off campus it is about the same.
Off-Campus Housing:
500% better than the dorms
Administration:
They really do just care for themselves and their salary.
Party Scene:
The curfew hours doesn't allow you to leave your room...
Scholarships:
When it comes to money, you always have to work for it.
Campus Food:
The food is pretty bad... No options, always serving pasta/rice. No healthy food options except for the salad bar.
Campus Housing:
Though it is an Adventist institution, the most Adventist aspect about it is that they serve a vegetarian cuisine. The buildings are falling apart, the stop giving you the scholarships agreed in freshman year, housing is horrific, the study body is rude, administration only care for themselves and their salary... it's just bad.
Off-Campus Dining:
i couldnt ask for anything better
Local Area:
Safety around the school is terrible. Guards wont show up till 30 minutes or later or not at all
Campus Housing:
The dorms are terrible. Not even worth the money you pay. Bathrooms are unbearable. Have to wear slippers because it is so nasty in the showers. No privacy. Stinks all the time.
Campus Housing:
The dorms need to be re-done period. I do not live on campus, but after seeing the living conditions, I'm quite glad I don't. Not only is it expensive, the rooms are too cramped for normal living. I hope they build or re-do the dorms. Especially the women's dorm.
Overall Experience:
My favorite experiences are seeing the Acro Airs acrobatic team perform, the annual ASA's African Show, and Service Day. This school is unique, because it is affiliated with the church. Although I did not want to come here, I'm truly making the best of it. This school definitely has potential.
Off-Campus Dining:
DC restaurants are a metro ride away. Downtown Silver Spring is popular for the eateries.
Guys & Girls:
Both the guys and girls here are attractive and fun to be around, and overall really great people. There are a lot of cliques, unfortunately, but most people are very kind. Students here tend to jump into serious relationships too quickly, in my opinion. But it's expected at a small school like this one.
Overall Experience:
The alumni is pretty strong, actually.
Overall Experience:
This is not the school I originally planned to go to, but I'm making the best of it. The class sizes are great. You get to feel connected to the professor and students. There is a lack of course variety, unfortunately. Teachers vary as well. The events are fantastic, I wish more students were aware. This university has a LOT of potential to be a wonderful school, it just needs a little more help.
Majors:
All you do is apply for your major, and you're in. Nothing special or hard. If you are pursuing a BA, you have to have a minor or concentration to graduate. It's really that simple.
Diversity:
This university is extremely diverse. Many students hail from the Caribbean, Africa, and Latin America. There are other Asian ethnicity too. We take pride in our diversity here. Despite being an Adventist school, there are a large group of people who are not Adventist. And yes, there are people here who are LGBT. You just have to look really really hard.
Greek Life:
We don't have Greek life, probably cuz the school is too small. It'd be nice,!! Can't Uninstall J2SE 5.0 -- Can't Reinstall J2SE 5.0!

Hello!
Apologies if this is not the correct forum, but I figured only advanced users may have an answer...
I installed J2SE 5.0 on my home PC 4-5 weeks ago. I installed it on my D: drive partition with my other applications. My relatively small C: drive partition is reserved for Windows stuff, even though many applications still install files there in 'C:\Program Files' without any intervention from me -- Sun's JDKs do this, they put huge files in the 'C:\Program Files\Common Files\Java' folder.
Anyway, yesterday, my C: drive filled up (on of the other applications was dumping large temp files there without me knowing!) and in an effort to clean up, I removed some of the J2SE 5.0 files that I thought were temporary, left over from the installation.
Later, after all was cleaned up, my instinct was to uninstall J2SE 5.0 and reinstall. The uninstaller complained it could not continue because it could not find a particular DLL (it didn't say which one). Basically, I couldn't uninstall using this uninstaller anymore, so I set out to manually cleanup.
I've removed the J2SE 5.0 folder from my D: drive. I removed the 'C:\Program Files\Common Files\Java' folder and all its subfolders. I also found an installation folder in 'C:\WINDOWS\Local Settings\Application Data'.
Finally, I removed *every* entry referring to J2SE and JDK from the Windows Registry. I only had J2SE 5.0 installed and there is no reference to any version of a JDK or J2SE in the registry.
In theory, my PC is completely clean of a JDK.
Then I ran the J2SE 5.0 install programme again -- and it eventually stops and says "You already have this version of the JDK installed."
WHAT? How can this be?, I ask!
Does anyone know of any other files and/or locations the JDK stores in? The installer must be finding a file to check to come up with its conclusion that I have J2SE 5.0 installed. As I said earlier, the Windows Registry has no references to it anymore.
Help! I can't install J2SE 5.0 again until I fix this!
Personally, I think this is a flaw in the installation program. It should allow one to install over anything that was left over from a previous install -- or a botched uninstall! :-(
Many thanks in advance for any help.

It really is annoying how so many applications want to use C: You really have to work to keep the C drive clean. Anyway, I think I would search the directories on your PATH and look into any other environment settings that the installer might use.
If that doesn't find anything, then searches of the whole system for java*.* might find something.

hello,
I once had a similar problem. The solution was to clean the registry manually from data that was not obviously part of the jdk. The precise error messages and default values for user options / choosers of any kind (!) during the installation provided the relevant hints to the keys in the registry I had to remove. This included very long, cryptic key names.
I suggest to continue to try a manual uninstall. Focus on the registry. Investigate each mm^2 of all steps of the failing installation procedure, all options you have, all dialogs (including things like file choosers!) for any information that might help you.

Thank you to Bill (I love your
Java
Exam Cram books!) and Conan for your help and suggestions.
I finally fixed the problem and here's how:
1) ... and I'm not sure if this really helped, but certainly didn't hurt: I had still got the JDK1.5.0\bin folder in my PATH as set in autoexec.bat (on my Win98 system). So, I temporarily removed it until I had a successful install.
2) ... what I *really* think fixed it:
On the second day of trying to fix the problem, when I reran the installation programme when it got to "Configuring Windows Installer" I got the following error message:
"The configuration data for this product is corrupt. Contact your support personnel."
NOW WHAT?! So, after banging my head against the desk 50 times, I somehow guessed this was a more generic problem than anything to do with the JDK install. The error was coming from Windows Installer. I Googled for the error message. The following link gave me the best clue:
Basically, it says:
Analyze the MSI log file to find the errors that were encountered during the installation. The MSI log file can usually be found in the Temp directory. If the installation log file does not exist, then see the document How to create an installation log file when installing Norton AntiVirus Corporate Edition 7.5. Troubleshoot any errors that the installation log file reports.
"The following is an example of an MSI error log and the solution:
MSI log entry:
'last line that generated an error'
MSI (c) (1F:CB): Unexpected or missing value (name: 'PackageName', value: '') in key
'HKCU\Software\Microsoft\Installer\Products\74BE21DBFDBD3D11EBAE000ACC725290\SourceList'
Solution
1. Delete all instances of the
string
'74BE21DBFDBD3D11EBAE000ACC725290' from the registry.
2. Restart computer.
The "How to create an installation log file..." link gave me this information:
To create an installation log file, run Setup.exe with the following command-line parameters:
setup.exe /s /v"/qn /l*v c:\log.txt"
So, I did this:
jdk-1_5_0-windows-i586.exe /s /v"/qn /l*v E:\Temp\JDKlog.txt"
Sure enough, the resulting logfile gave me a message similar to:
MSI (c) (1F:CB): Unexpected or missing value (name: 'PackageName', value: '') in key
'HKCU\Software\Microsoft\Installer\Products\74BE21DBFDBD3D11EBAE000ACC725290\SourceList'
So, using my favourite registry editor (Registrar Lite) I searched for the long alphanumeric key string and, sure enough, I found several.
In my registry cleanup yesterday I must have removed some of these and not all of them (because I was searching for other things and therefore not found every instance of this string).
So, I deleted them all, as suggested earlier, and then rebooted.
I then tried to install J2SE 5.0 and... SUCCESS! Phewwwwwww!
Wow, what a nightmare process to get this done!
So, now, after successfully installing, the JDK has left enormous files on my C: drive (back to how all this started in the first place!). They are in these folders:
C:\Program Files\Common Files\Java\Update\Base Images\jdk1.5.0.b64 C:\Program Files\Common Files\Java\Update\Base Images\jdk1.5.0.b64\patch-jdk1.5.0.b64 C:\Program Files\Common Files\Java\Update\Base Images\jre1.5.0.b64
(I've since learnt that you *must not* remove these ZIP files!)
and here:
C:\WINDOWS\Local Settings\Application Data\{32A3A4F2-B792-11D6-A78A-00B0D0150000}
The long alphanumeric string will be different for your computer, but the folder contains these files:
1033.MST (4KB) J2SE Development Kit 5.0.msi (41,139KB)
Take a look around, you will find *.msi (Windows Installer Package) files all over your C: drive!
I *think* it is safe to remove them, but, now I'm afraid to. I'd love to recover the huge amount of disk space they take up. Does anyone know if it is *really* safe to remove them?

I would rename the directories like:
C:\WINDOWS\Local Settings\Application Data\{32A3A4F2-B792-11D6-A78A-00B0D0150000} to C:\WINDOWS\Local Settings\Application DataHidden\{32A3A4F2-B792-11D6-A78A-00B0D0150000}
keep them some days or weeks and find out if everyhting is working fine, and remove them if yes.
If I would use windows...

Paul Wheaton5 Important Advances in Addiction Treatment
The statistics on addiction treatment and recovery are grim. It is estimated that 10% of Americans, more than thirty million people in all, suffer from addiction, but only 13% of those will ever seek treatment. While they have helped millions to get sober, 12-step programs have a success rate estimated at 8-13%, though some suggest far less, in the range of 5%. There has been no rigorous exploration of 12-step programs, but they continue to be the “treatment of choice” despite their poor outcomes. Of those who go to residential treatment programs, one year post-treatment it is estimated that only 13% remain sober. This might be because most treatment programs rely heavily on the 12-step model for their treatment protocols. Treatment centers like mine, Cliffside Malibu, have a 70% recovery rate at one year, but sadly, most treatment centers have not moved on as we have, to use the evidence-based treatment protocols that are proven to work. …and most do not divulge their success rates.
There is a better way. Over the past two decades, evidence-based therapies have developed bringing hope for true recovery to the addiction treatment industry. Evidence-based simply means “scientifically proven.” These various therapies, when used together, create a treatment synergy that allows for real, long-lasting recovery. My full-time Director of Addiction Research, Dr. Constance Scharff, and I wrote a book, Ending Addiction for Good, now in its second edition, detailing this treatment approach in the hope that other treatment facilities would upgrade their treatment protocols to include these proven techniques. Meanwhile, our efforts are also focused on public education, in the hope that the public will demand from treatment providers access to therapies that truly work.
What are the greatest inroads into addiction treatment? No single treatment is the be-all, end-all, but here are a few for your consideration.
1. Evidence-Based Treatment
Evidence-based treatment is based on the latest scientific research. What works in addiction treatment and what does not is studied and published in academic journals. This is an ever-changing set of treatment protocols, changing as new studies are released and new treatment procedures developed. These treatments can come from any number of fields: medicine, psychology, neuroscience, holistic health practices and/or complementary medicine. Experts are in agreement that evidence-based practices are the most effective for long-term recovery.
The finest treatment centers, like Cliffside Malibu, use a variety of scientifically proven methods with their clients. None of these treatments, on their own, will “cure” addiction, but when used together, they create lasting, long-term recovery when clients complete a full-term of treatment, usually three to four months in duration.
The majority of addiction treatment centers have not moved from 12 step model treatment to evidence-based treatment. This is tragic. 12 step programs were never designed to be primary treatment. While useful, they are support groups of individuals without training in helping people overcome the deep wounds that cause addiction. 12 step programs are an important supplement to treatment, but should not be considered treatment when used alone.
2. Individualized Care
Receiving individualized treatment is also critical for long-term addiction recovery to be successful. Many treatment facilities, to manage costs, put all clients through the same treatment protocol. At eight you might have a meditation group, at 8:30 breakfast followed by a 12-step meeting, group process session, art therapy, and lunch. While this may seem like a productive, well-planned day, it is nothing more than a way to fill the hours. To recover from addiction, one must get at the root causes of their addiction problem – which means using a variety of therapies in an individualized process to overcome these old wounds and build a path to recovery. You or your loved one, because of your particular history of trauma, the drugs you’ve been using, the dosage, and the amount of time you’ve been using, will require a personalized treatment plan using a wide-array of treatments, to overcome addiction for good.
3. Intensive One-on-One Psychotherapy
One-on-one psychotherapy, which should take place at least three days a week in residential treatment and is suggested twice a week for the first year of sobriety, is critical to creating lasting addiction recovery. Its goal is to examine and overcome the psychological causes of addiction. Whatever the trigger was that made a person need to use alcohol or drugs in the first place, that needs to be examined. If this is done, recovery is more likely to stick.
Why is psychotherapy so important? It allows an individual first to receive support and care in a safe environment and build a trusting therapeutic relationship with someone with the skill to help process the pain or trauma from the past. Addiction rarely develops without archaic pain. In order to live a new life, the addict must work through those issues and gain skills for dealing with future difficult events. In this way, the addict develops tools for living and having important, appropriate intimate relationships with others.
4. The Stages of Change
Developed by one of the world’s leading psychologists, Dr. James Prochaska, and his colleagues from the University of Maryland, the Stages of Change model teaches us that change happens in a predictable manner. Because we know how change occurs, we can also anticipate the likely obstacles to change. In other words, if we know where a person is in the change process, we can help them avoid the common issues that cause relapse. At Cliffside Malibu, we walk with a person through the stages of change, helping them navigate the change process safely and effectively. Through an aftercare plan and ongoing support, we’re able to help an individual move through the stages until they are in the “maintenance” stage and effectively able to manage their recovery on their own.
5. Neuroscience
The latest discoveries in neuroscience are teaching us that the real change of addiction recovery is happening in the brain. The brain is much more dynamic and malleable than we ever imagined. The latest research indicates that while the brain is changed by addiction, rewired so to speak, it is also changed, also rewired, by recovery. Our Director of Addiction Research is working with international leaders in neuroscience to show how the brain can be renewed, in a sense, by addiction treatment and recovery.
These are but a few of the many advances being made in addiction treatment. The bottom line: be careful where you send your loved one for treatment. Ask about evidence-based treatment and find out what, if any, of the latest scientifically proven methods of addiction treatment the treatment center you’ve chosen is using. Your loved one deserves the best. There is real hope now in the field of addiction treatment, real recovery. Demand that your loved one receive treatment that is scientifically proven to be effective. They deserve it.

Department of Finance, The London School of Economics and Political Science, London, UK. (Unpublished)
Abstract
We link cross-sectional variation in both realized and expected state-level house price appreciation to cross-sectional variation in demographic changes. In particular, we extract two components of expected population growth: 1) a natural component due to predictable demographic changes related to fertility and mortality rates and 2) a non-natural component due to immigration. Our analysis shows that only the second component forecasts cross-sectional variation in state-level house price appreciation. We find that the sensitivity of both realized and expected returns to these demographic changes is stronger for states with greater population density, consistent with population growth actually causing the price appreciation rather than merely being correlated with some other phenomenon. We also document that building permits anticipate a portion of future population growth and house price appreciation. However, lagged measures of building activity do not subsume the ability of our expected immigration proxy to forecast price appreciation. Our findings are consistent with fundamentals driving an economically important portion of cross-sectional variation in state-level housing returns. However, markets appear to significantly underreact to the component of fundamentals that is arguably more di¢ cult for market participants to anticipate.NATO supply route into Afghanistan expected to reopen soon
Latest update : 2010-10-03
The main land route used by NATO to deliver supplies into Afghanistan will reopen soon, according to Pakistani officials. The route was blocked on Thursday after a NATO helicopter strike killed three Pakistani soldiers.
AP - Pakistan will soon reopen a key NATO supply route into Afghanistan that it shut last week after three Pakistani troops were killed in a helicopter strike by the military alliance in a border area, officials said Sunday.

So, if the new health plan offered by the Democrats will be paid by the public and the public is the one receiving the health care, I fail to see the problem. We have paid and are still paying for failed government policies that did not offer one-tenth of 1 percent of what this offers, but that's OK - heaven forbid that we get working Americans good health care.
Forget that each one of us lucky enough to have health care are already paying for people who do not - oh yes, part of our premium goes towards the uninsured.
So, why don't we ask big business to help foot the bill? It is because that would be politically incorrect to expect business to help share the cost. If they did that, they could not have their golden parachute and multimillion-dollar salaries. And I almost forgot: We need the multimillionaires to take our company's profits that were built by my grandfather and yours to other countries and bankrupt the plant here in the United States.
I just do not get it. I hope that I am not alone, and others see this as a problem, because sooner or later we will be the ones without health care.Cakewalk has released version 2.5 of Project5.

take hold of; grab tightlyMexican composer Gabriela Ortiz's "Camelia la Tejana," which will be performed this month at Long Beach Opera, is actually three stories in one.
First, there's the legend of Camelia la Tejana, a Mexican drug-smuggling queen who shot and killed her lover in a jealous fit — if, that is, she really existed.
Then there's the tale of how Camelia's gruesome exploits were immortalized in the smash narcocorrido tune "Contrabando y Traición" (Contraband and Betrayal), which was written by Ángel González and definitively recorded by the superstar norteño band Los Tigres del Norte.

Finally, there's the story of how Ortiz and her brother, L.A.-based multimedia artist Rubén Ortiz Torres, stumbled upon a 1986 interview with a woman claiming to be the "real" Camelia la Tejana in the Mexico City murder-and-mayhem newspaper Alarma! (yes, the exclamation mark is part of its name). That tabloid confessional, Ortiz says, helped persuade her and her sibling that the lurid saga of Camelia was the stuff of which great opera could be made.Calendar June2015.pdf Our end of the year celerbation for our classes will be onsite this year, scheduled for June 19th.

Goal:
The goal of this project is to evaluate the ability of modern seismic methods to detect, map and analyze naturally fractured gas reservoirs, and assess future research needs in this area.
Background:
During the last ten years there has been considerable research in developing and evaluating various seismic techniques for fracture characterization for petroleum and gas applications as well as for mining, geothermal and nuclear waste disposal. Current methods rely on gross definition of fracture properties using attributes such as P-wave anisotropy, AVO (Amplitude versus Offset) or AVA (Amplitude versus Angle). While useful for gross fracture detection, these approaches have not been able to define the specific fracture sets that control permeability. This effort investigated high-resolution seismic methods (including vertical seismic profiling [VSP] and single well seismic) for their ability to provide useful information on fracture properties. A key focus of this effort was to combine the surface seismic information with current borehole seismic methods. Field studies in the San Juan Basin in New Mexico were conducted to validate the most promising seismic characterization methods, and a validation well was drilled. The final stages of the work were to synthesize project data and information to produce a handbook of the best methods for fracture characterization using seismic and well data in the San Juan Basin.

The location, extent, and geometry of the fractures in these reservoirs have been poorly understood in the past, but studies such as this one have improved fracture prediction and fracture quantification. The success of the Newberry well indicates that seismic waveform modeling, seismic anisotropy analysis, VSP and single-well seismic analysis, specialized borehole logging and imaging techniques, and production history matching are powerful tools for targeting areas where natural fractures are abundant and gas production is likely to be high.

Watch NowCAPSULE: A pet chameleon falls from a truck in the middle of the Nevada desert. He soon finds his way to the dying Western town of Dirt where his bragging and his lucky defeat of a predatory hawk make him the town's new sheriff. Sadly, the town is drying up for shortage of water. In the best Western tradition Sheriff Rango sets out to save the town. Sight gags, film references, jokes, action, and just plain funny storytelling follow as thick as a hail of bullets. Director Gore Verbinski shows his animation direction of John Logan's script is as good as his live-action direction on films like PIRATES OF THE CARIBBEAN. This is a smart, hip comedy that works for adults and youngsters alike. Rating: high +2 (-4 to +4) or 8/10
RANGO is a "funny animals" sort of animated film, but terrarium predatory hawk Rango lucks out and kills the hawk. The townspeople now believe his bragging and want Rango as their new sheriff--failing to tell Rango that his predecessors named to that job may have lived to regret it ... or not.
But Rango probably won't have his job long. Dirt has some real problems. Rango comes to the town just as Dirt is parceling out to its citizenry the last few days of water. When the water source dies the town will soon follow it, and that day is less than a week away. Meanwhile the mayor (Ned Beatty) of the town seems to still have big plans. He tells Rango that who controls the water controls everything.
Okay, let me digress here. This is what THE INCREDIBLES called "monologing." It is a major weakness in the writing. This statement is the key to everything that is happening in the town. In his anxiousness to make sure the viewer knows what is going on writer John Logan has the mayor saying exactly the wrong thing to the new sheriff. It is not hard for the viewer to figure out who the villain has to be just by his appearance. This is virtually a confession before Rango even knows there is chicanery going on. And part of the chicanery is the stealing of the plot of CHINATOWN. Another part is the counterfeiting of a cameo appearance that had me fooled. Timothy Olyphant does a spot-on impression of another famous actor. I found completely convincing, and I am generally good with voices.
There were several familiar actors voicing major roles. Besides Depp, Beatty, and Olyphant, there was Isla Fisher, Abigail Breslin, Alfred Molina, Bill Nighy, Steven Root, Harry Dean Stanton, and Ray Winstone. Animation directors seem to feel the public needs familiar voices to appreciate the characters. I frankly doubt that most viewers pick up on all these voices. Admittedly some of these are very good actors. But the film industry is full of good and deserving actors who are out of work. I personally think that it is bad for a successful actor to accept a voice-only role that could go to an actor less successful.
It is good that animated films are starting to be considered acceptable for adults with or without children to see. Some of the best writing is going into animated films. I often find myself in theaters seeing animated films where my wife and I are the only party without children present. Good writing should be savored and appreciated and there was really even too much good writing for anyone--adult or child--to take in on one viewing.
Smart, crafty, hip, and full of wit, RANGO may be one of the best films of the year, animated or live action. I rate it a high +2 on the -4 to +4 scale or 8/10.

The American rapper recently popped the question to his reality star girlfriend and the couple are said to already be planning their special day.
Even though Kim is said to be pleased her fiancé is getting into the swing of things it is thought she doesn’t want to make it too over the top as she has already been married twice.
Her first husband was music producer Damon Thomas in 2000, followed by a 72-day marriage to basketball player Kris Humphries in 2011.
“It’s flattering for Kim, because Kris didn’t really care what their wedding was like – he just gave her a list of who he wanted to invite,” a source told British magazine Closer. “Kanye is much more involved, but she’s told him to hold back a little, as she doesn’t want to get too carried away. She’s embarrassed because she feels she’s already had the big do.”
However, it seems like the 36-year-old musician is keen to go all out for the ceremony. As it is his first wedding Kanye reportedly wants a big, extravagant event and has no plans to scrimp on their spending.
“Kanye’s been telling the wedding planner to break the budget – he’s told Kim he wants the world to be talking about their big day,” the insider added. “The wedding planner is looking at several venues, including one if Paris, and Kanye is insisting on a big entertainment area – there will be fireworks, vintage champagne, an orchestra and tons of flowers.”
Kim’s mother Kris is also said to be thrilled about what to expect. After having recently separated from her husband of 22 years, Bruce Jenner, the businesswoman is looking ahead.
“Kris has been so excited. She’s already thinking about her outfit and who she can invite,” the source continued.

Exams
Just like essays, exams can come in a variety of different forms and can test a variety of different aptitudes. You may be asked to answer Multiple Choice Questions. However, as Drama relies so heavily on analysis of a range of elements contained in literary and performed texts, your exams are much more likely to include a series of short answer questions and/or a number of essay questions that ask for particular kinds of analysis.
1. Multiple choice questions
Multiple choice questions might be included in exams to test the breadth of knowledge students have developed in a particular field and to give students opportunities to demonstrate their familiarity and understanding of material they have learned in lectures and tutorials and by reading set texts. However, in Drama, students are expected to utilise and apply the information they learn each week in practical tasks in tutorials and in the development of a production. As a result, multiple choices questions are less likely to be offered in exams for Drama unless your lecturer wants to test your familiarity with information on specific subjects or texts.
2. The short answer question
Short answer questions ask you to consider specific points about a subject or a text. To answer these questions accurately, you need to first identify what you are being asked to outline. If you are asked to provide a brief summary in bullet points, then do not write a paragraph. If you asked to provide a paragraph that describes a subject then be sure to construct a paragraph with descriptions of your subject rather than comparisons with other subjects. You should take your time to read the instructions included in short answer questions and then proceed to provide the information that is requested using a clear and succinct writing style.
3. Exam essays
Exam essays again exercise your ability to analyse and identify information. However, they require good preparation and a much more thorough understanding of concepts, theories, texts and performances you have studied during your course. If you feel you are likely to experience tension or stress during exam periods, strategies for collating course material effectively and preparing for your exams are offered through Student Services so be sure to arrange an appointment. If you simply need a few tips on how to collate the material you may need to write an essay in the exam, you should begin your preparation by considering how the wording of essay questions may suggest different essay structures and arguments. Once you have accounted for all the different approaches you may be asked to accommodate within your essay, you will be able to consider ways to organise the material you have learned and collated throughout the duration of your course.
Examples of active words in essay questions:
- If you are asked to identify something you are often being asked to explain or elaborate details of a concept so you may need to offer a list or outline of observations, descriptions, definitions relating to your subject.
- If you are asked to explain something you are often being asked to consider various points of view associated with a subject and to give reasons to account for something in particular.
- If you are asked to compare something with another concept or evaluation, you will be looking for similarities, differences and connections between ideas outlined in the question.
- If you are asked to argue something you are often being asked to take a position on an issue and to defend this position with evidence and convincing arguments.
- If you are asked to assess something you are often being asked to outline and utilise criteria used to evaluate, review or judge an object, practice or idea.

Exam Tips
Exam preparation starts in Week 1. If you set up a well organised notetaking system early in the semester your exam study period will be more effective. Active participation in lectures and tutorials will ensure that you have ample opportunities to ask questions and develop a thorough understanding of the subject. Your lecturer or tutor will be more than happy to give you help as you need it throughout the semester. You should go over your notes at the end of the week and make a list of questions for your lecturer. If you keep up to date with the material throughout the semester you will find the pressure of the exam period a little easier to manage. As a general rule of thumb, you should aim to devote 10 hours per week to each 10 credit point subject that you are studying.
Example of a plan for the average work that you should do for one Drama unit each week:
- 3 hours class contact per week.
- 2 hours personal rehearsal per week.
- 3 hours research on assessment tasks per week.
- 2 hours per week devoted to reading plays and forming critical opinions of texts.
TOTAL: 10 hours per week
It may seem like you have a lot of material to juggle, but with careful preparation you can make every moment of your exam preparation count.
One Month Before the Exam:
One month should be enough time to prepare for a unit that covers a single semester. There are several important steps to follow at this point in the exam revision process.
Collect and read all the things that will be relevant to the exam. This includes:
- primary texts (plays, novels, poems, short stories, films, etc.)
- secondary texts (essays, text books, suggested readings, etc.)
- lecture notes (you may need to re-write them or fill in the gaps if you don't understand what you meant when you wrote the notes two months ago)
- unit outline
- handouts
- internet notes
- assignment questions (these topics might give you some clues about possible exam questions)
- completed assessment tasks (lecturers' comments are very useful. You don't want to make the same errors in your assignment and in the exam)
This is the best time to compile a list of questions for your lecturer. Often there will be time provided in class to revise the semester's work and to prepare for the exam. Don't waste this opportunity. Be prepared to ask your lecturer to clarify any points that you have forgotten or you didn't understand throughout the semester.
List of Topics:
Create a list of topics that will be relevant to the exam. Use this list as a guide to your study regime throughout the weeks leading up to the exam.
- after reading through all of the above try to compile a list of the most important topics.
- pay particular attention to the issues that your lecturer focussed on.
make a note of any 'hints' or 'tips' that your lecturer slipped into the classes throughout the semester.
- try to write yourself some sample questions and see how effectively you can answer them without referring to your notes.
Now that you have made a list of topics that are likely to be covered on the paper, you should set up a revision timeline so that you spend at least an hour a day focussing on one of the topics on the list. [Don't forget that you will also have new content being presented during the last weeks of the semester so you should pay particular attention to managing your time effectively].
Exam Format:
Read through your Unit Outline and ask your lecturer exactly what format the exam will take. Different styles of questions require different study strategies. Questions may be in any combination of the following styles:
- multiple choice questions.
- short answer questions requiring single sentence answers.
- short answer questions requiring an answer in the form of a paragraph.
- short essay questions (approximately 1-2 pages)
- long essay questions (approximately 3-4 pages)
You should also find out whether you need to answer every question on the paper or if there will be a choice offered to you.
Try writing yourself a practice exam paper and give yourself the same length of time to answer all of the questions as you will be given on the day. Literature and Drama exams are typically 2 hours long (but check with your lecturer to make sure).
One Week Before the Exam:
Check the Exam timetable on the ACU Internet site so that you know exactly when and where the exam is to be held. It is often a good idea to confer with other students in your class to make sure that you have the correct time and place for the exam.
Make sure that you have covered all of the topics that you added to your list of possible areas that could appear on the paper.
Some students benefit from working with a friend during this final study period. One approach may be to form a discussion group where you can learn from each other. You could each write a mock exam paper and ask the other person to sit it under exam conditions.
The Night Before:
Don't try to cram your study into one night before the test. You will be much more confident and relaxed during the exam if you do not start studying new material on the evening before. You should use this time to consolidate your knowledge of each of the topics that you have been studying intensively over the past month. You will be much better served if you have a solid revision period in the evening and get to bed early. If you are totally rested you will perform more effectively on the day.
The Exam:
Make sure you arrive early for the exam so that you are not flustered and stressed. Try to relax as much as possible. Exams are notoriously stressful so you need to make sure that you have adequately prepared for the day so that you can be calm in the knowledge that you are as prepared as you can be.
Use the Exam time as efficiently as possible.
- read the questions very carefully during the perusal time.
- if you have any questions about the paper you may ask the supervisor during this period.
- write down your exam strategy at the start of the paper. [ie. make yourself a time line]
Example of a plan for a 2 hour exam worth 50%. This exam has 2 sections:
PART A: 6 short answer questions (each worth 5 marks)
PART B: 2 essay questions (each worth 10 marks)
Allow 8 minutes for each of the short answer questions.
Allow 30 minutes for each of the essay questions.
Allow 12 minutes to proofread you work.
- Make sure that you stick to your exam time frame.
- Initially, try not to waste time on the questions that you do not definitely know the answers to. Come back to them at the end if you have time.
- Be as comprehensive as you can. The fuller your response, the more likely you are to answer all aspects of the question.
- Leave space at the end of your answer before you start the next question. You may find that you think up more things to say later on and you will find it easier to include them if there is space on the same page.
- Pay particular attention to the details of the question. It might be that the question is asking you to address one of the topics on your study list in a way that you hadn't considered previously. So, don't just jump in and write the first thing that comes into your head.
- Stay for the full length of time allocated. Even if you think you've finished the paper, there may be some new ideas that come to you as you proofread your answers. Use any left over time to expand some of your answers. Remember to check your spelling and grammar. Double check that you have answered all of the questions (turn over every sheet of paper to make sure that you haven't missed anything). If by staying until the end you manage to correct one error or add one extra point to your ideas then your efforts will not have been wasted.
Your Lecturer's Marking Style:
It is always best to discuss what your Lecturer is looking for in class. However, there are some general principles which many Lecturers adhere to that can guide your exam preparations. When a Lecturer marks papers s/he is usually looking for several things at one:
1. your knowledge of the topic;
2. your ability to apply that knowledge.
So, how does your Lecturer go about assessing these things? Firstly, s/he looks at the accuracy of the information that you present and then s/he looks at how you manipulate that information to address the specifications of the question.
As a general rule of thumb you could adhere to the following suggestion when answering any short answer or essay questions.
To receive one mark you will need to make a significant point and back that point up with an example (eg. from a play, novel, poem, etc.).
If you follow this basic principle you will write at least two comprehensive sentences in order to gain one mark. To gain full marks on a "5 mark" short answer question, then, you would need to write at least 10 sentences [this would be approximately 200 words or 1 page worth of handwriting]. You cannot hope to get 5 marks by writing a two or three line answer.
Another thing that your lecturer is looking for is a clear understanding of the primary material. Try to demonstrate that you understand features of the primary material such as the themes/plot/characterisations/style/etc. The best way to do this is to give lots of examples to prove that you have both read and understood the texts.

It’s almost Friday! Are you as glad as I am when Friday arrives?
I have been doing a little freshening in my master bath and actually trying to decide if it’s time to paint the bathroom and bedroom. It’s been dark for awhile now and I almost think it’s time for a little lightening.
Until the decision is made whether to paint or not, I am making a few small changes. I changed out the shiny brass hardware on the cabinets and am saving to buy some new light fixtures above the sinks.
Of course, there’s always the fun of fluffing.
(It is so hard to get good pictures over my tub)
Absolutely love this old apple bucket holding towels and soaps.
My favorite white tulips!
Junk to Joy etsy shop.
I love dried lavender also. I bought this little lavender filled peat pot last summer from my friend Becky over at her beautiful etsy shop.
Candles in the bathroom are a must, right?
I usually don’t have the chance to take bubble baths, but when I do….I am in heaven. Jets and bubbles are so relaxing.
A couple of old prints rest on my flea market shelf. I love the black and whites and how subtle they are. Another few pieces of lavender are contained in two old salt and pepper shakers. Take the lids off and voila…great vintage vases.
Thanks for stopping by and hanging out with me for a few minutes today, my friends.
Have a blessed upcoming weekend.

Your tub area is so pretty, Amy. I adore the vintage apple basket used for soaps and towels. I often treat myself to a bubble bath with candles. Totally relaxing after a long day at work.
I'm laughing at myself. I wasn't even planning an oomph up of our master bath, but now I'm planning to pin your ideas.
I love it all,especially the dried lavender and the tulips.
I LOVE IT ALL!!
Oh Amy, I may have to take a trip to Tennessee just to relax in your bath!!
I love the special touches that you added, they are so lovely.
Wishing you a fabulous weekend.
Sincerely,
Melinda
Amy,
I love what you're doing in your Master Bath! The apple bucket and that shelf with the vintage black and white prints stunning accents, dear friend. Lavendar is an herb that grows well in our heat on the Prairie. I tie up bundles and place on the lower level living areas! Heavenly scent! This is a perfectly relaxing post for the weekend! Enjoy!
Fondly,
Pat
Oh it looks so inviting. Gorgeous room and your accessories are beautiful. Hugs, Marty
I love your accessories, especially the old apple bucket holding the soaps, etc. The tulips are so pretty too.
I hope your Mom is doing well. I'm thinking of you both.
Take care,
Pam
oh, it's so pretty in there. I really love the dark color! nothing like a bubble bath to make you feel human again, lol!! xoxo
I'm with Marty...it looks SO inviting! I haven't had a bubble bath in a long time...I lean toward bath oils in the winter. The bucket holding your soap and towels is so charming! The lavender is a nice touch, too. I have to visit Becky's shop!
XO,
Jane
Isn't is so fun to "fluff" the bath? Yours looks so inviting, I love all the touches you added.
~Shanon
Love the bucket! And those little jars!
Holly
Oh how relaxing this looks! The apple basket is my favorite! Of course, the lavender is a close second. I'm sure it smells heavenly in there!
And I love the black & white prints. Great spot for them.
To paint or not to paint...that is a great question. I love the color now, but I will love it if you paint it too :)
Enjoy your bath :)
Amy, my master bathroom is feeling very neglected after your post, guess I will be doing some fluffing over the weekend! I will be pulling in some mercury glass and it is ever so long since I had flowers in there. We lightened up our walls last summer and it made a huge difference, so really it deserves some attention. I am trying to figure out a window treatment to soften things a little in there, maybe another sheer?
Tracey
BE-autif-ul!!
Better watch out your guests will arrive with towels beneath their arms! lol
Now that is a serene relaxing spot.
The bathroom is the only place I can escape the kids...lol, for a few minutes anyways~
What a nice bathroom !! beautiful decorated !!...have a nice weekend....love Ria.....xxx...
You have much more space than I do. Love the extra tea lights in the jar idea.
Wow Amy your bath is beautiful! I love what you have done. The apple bucket is darling. Have a great weekend and thanks for the kind words.

The five key things that are going to help marketers achieve greater success.
Every year I have shared digital marketing resolutions with my marketing peers. These resolutions are driven by three things - consumer research, input from other marketers, and all the yoga I do :).
In 2011, I came up with 17 resolutions, and while these resolutions were very popular, they became far too many to achieve in one calendar year. So in 2012, I came up with five resolutions. The five trends included a sharp focus on transactional messaging, a cross-channel preference center, and a keen focus on deliverability. You can read the entire article on my "Email Yogi" digital book.
For 2013, I want to focus again on five key things that are going to help marketers achieve greater success.
Good luck with your digital campaigns in 2013. I wish you the very best personally, and I do hope to see you at an SES event later this year.

The single-channel LNBR uses small ceramic capacitors (instead of electrolytic) within the boost regulator control for a lower profile, a key requirement in LCD TV designs. Furthermore, the device provides a 15.6-V output setting to accommodate Japanese design requirements.
The regulator has internal protection, a boost MOSFET, current sensing, and compensation, which simplifies its design and minimizes components and PCB size.

The architectural studio Soma (Austria) has developed this “Multiple natures – fibrous tower” for the competition in Taichung (Taiwan). Based on the principles of animal and plant life, this structure is to house the observation tower and city museum. Both exterior and interior of this set is to adapt to weather condition through the newest systems, equipment and construction material which is also to be primarily locally produced. Hollows formed in clusters provide maximum wind resistance; the architecturally dubbed fibers of plants adapt to the load on each individual segment of the structure, all together offering the eight-towered aerodynamic organic beauty.

Did he not pull out his recyclables? Did he not separate his glass from his plastic? It turns out that what is maddening about Kazim Ali's trash is that when he pulled up to the university trash bins, took out a box of poetry manuscripts to recycle and put it next to the bins, a person from the ROTC building next door called the local police and said that "a man of Middle Eastern descent...had just placed a box next to the trash can."
What happened next? Ali writes:
't even see me. He saw my darkness."
And when it was discovered that his recycling was, indeed, just that, did the police apologize to Ali for the trouble? No, they told him that he needed to be more careful about how he behaved. The university told him that the young man's call had nothing to do with his race or ethnic background, and that they appreciated his "cooperation during the incident and remind everyone that safety is a joint effort by all members of the campus community."
I don't know about you, but his story scares me to pieces.
6 comments:
Here's a small world item for you:
Kazim runs a press I criticized, but I still think what happened to him sucks.
I was wondering if you might know of him. And yes, what happened to him does suck, and what is happening to us sucks, too. Glad we were reminded.
Holy Crap!!! I almost spit out my morning coffee as I read this post. I REALLY want to go live on some remote tropical island and forget the rest of this insane world exists...but then again, that would be the easy way out.
Uuck...I feel sick to my stomach now.
I know. What we've allowed to come into our midst is sickening. It's not just "those (dark/Arab/not 'us') people"...just look at how his colleague who came to his defense was treated.
Someone said it was like the McCarthy era, but I think it's worse. At least McCarthy held his hearings in public. Most, if not all, of the current policy is being carried out in secret because of so-called "national security" concerns. Meaning they can do whatever they want whenever they want to whomever they want and can't be held to account. Now that's not only sickening, but terrifying.
I'm glad you posted the story on your blog as well. We should get it out to as wide an audience as possible.
I totally agree...and thanks for your sharp eye for putting it up on yours first!Posted by gandalf433
I dont think you can state this with confidence because you dont know. Yes he was cut from the team, but do you really call playing in 2 games in 2 years an oppourtunity?
We dont know if the Pats were planning on bringing him back and just got caught with their pants down. We needed a center and had to drop someone. I doubt they would just give up on him after endorsing him just weeks earlier.
In any event, even if they did give up on him, do you think he was given a chance? I dont buy the practice stuff because Perillo said he looked great in practices and my eyes said the same from what I saw in camp. Maybe he didnt have that rapport w/Brady, but he had no chance here.
How can you improve if you dont see the field? Some guys play better in games than practice. This guy got ONE SHOT this year. he went deep, beat his man, and Brady was flushed out the pocket and threw a bad ball. The Db broke it up..The End. This was Price's only oppty this year and last year in the finale he did well.
Like I said, thats not an oppt'y, thats a very short tryout.
Guys on offense get ONE Shot, while we got all kind of bums running around in the secondary with no risk of losing a job?!?!
Thats a problem!
Noone wants to admit that Brady has a short leash with Wr's. As much as he praised Ocho, what is he doing? He left him out the dry the minute they bought back High Top Underwood. He goes to Underwood and gets picked off and was about to ruin his confidence and O'bie stepped in to stop it.
I think its pretty obvious. Brady demands a ton and is a prima dona when it comes to working w/these guys. You mess up , you are done.
This, IMO is why Ocho is never on the field, yet when they need a 1st down, in comes Ocho and Boom! 1st down, now back to bench cuz Brady doesnt like to throw to you.
Look at how sparingly Hernandez has been used this year after a couple of early drops. How about running backs? How many passes they caught?
You really think Faulk is better than Ridley or Vareen? Or is it that Brady is just trying to live in the past and wants faulk out there because he is sooooo clutch on that 2 yard out.....lol - Brady needs to get over Branch and Faulk. Both look to be over the hill and play much more then they should.
My eyes work very well, please dont tell me these guys just cant play. Standards need to be lowered.).

This one really came out surprisingly well! Unfortunately, the client was about the meanest old man i’ve ever met. Had very little access to the car, so taking measurements was critical. I guess I’m used to working with 100% wood, maybe a bit of brass or brushed nickel here and there as accent, so trying to work in some extras was interesting. The guidelines I was given were as follows-” I want two cupholders and a change tray. Oh, and my wife doesn’t like right angles, so no corners.” Simple, huh? I did get to take a good bit of “creative license” that way, but I have to say, no corners? Really?? It took a round-over bit, a chainsaw, and a helluva lot of sandpaper, but I think it came out well. Did manage to cut my own throat again price-wise though, surprise surprise! Quoted him $175, hoping for more business from the car club, had $60+ in materials. So after all was said and done, figure I raked in around 3 bucks an hour. Oh well, we don’t do it for the money, do we!!!

I understand the no corners thing, considering the car it is going into doesn’t have any either. I like it, it looks so good. I do wonder what it looks like once installed. So are there speakers in it? If not, it gives me some ideas to make something like this but with speakers.
#6 posted 06-17-2012 08:58 PM
It does have speakers. The owner wanted me to just cut some slits in the wood, leave it at that. Didn’t really care that much I guess. I just couldn’t do it though. Took a 4” hole saw, went in about 1/4 in. on each side, routed out the middle. I did cut slits, but had decided to cover them with black foam. Couldn’t find any, of course, so I took an 1/8th in. piece of aluminum plate, the sort with hundreds of 1/4 in. holes in it, sprayed it black, cut 4” circles, popped ‘emThanks!

The TAG WELD™ system gives a secure fixing of plant labels to pots, preventing the possibility of labels being lost or customer tampering.
The rapid machine application attaches the label at the same height on every pot giving a uniform appearance for the retailer.
TAG WELD™ eliminates the need for a separate price or barcode sticker, with all the information on one pot label securely attached to the pot. The label can incorporate a perforated tear off section with the price/barcode if the plant is likely to be a gift item.
The system can be adapted to a variety of different label shapes and sizes. The patented ultrasonic welding method gives a fast secure and neat label fixing even when the pot is wet.
The TAG WELD™ label application system is patent protected and TAG WELD™ labels for use in the UK market are only available from PPC Labels.

Another good post. Originally pimms was served with Borage I think, a real pimms still is. I know the bottle says mint. This is I think because Borage is not as available as mint. In fact I only seem to see Borage in Waitrose.

The coolest thing I had for summer was Jamie’s Cucumber Lime and mint sorbet. Trying to find the recipe, it’s out there somewhere.
There is a Lemon Sherbet also out there, very refreshing.

Goodwin, Miles & Maconachie, Glenda J. (2007) Unpaid entitlements recovery in the Federal Industrial Relations System : strategy and outcomes 1952-95. Journal of Industrial Relations, 49(4), pp. 523-544.
Abstract
Despite awards and industrial agreements providing legally binding conditions of employment, many Australian employees do not always secure their employment entitlements. The inspection and prosecution strategies adopted by or forced upon the agency tasked with monitoring and enforcing the regulations are a key factor affecting whether or not employees will recover monies owed from non-compliant employers. This article examines the outcomes of different inspection and prosecution regimes between 1952 and 1995 in the Australian federal industrial relations system, and makes three points. The first is that employer evasion of employee entitlements has been significant, and sustained. Second, the shift from routine inspections to a complaints-based inspection strategy has reduced the probability of detection and subsequently encourages employer evasion. Third, the use of prosecution as a tool of `last resort' has provided little deterrence to employer non-compliance. The extent of evasion in a centralized industrial relations system raises questions about evasion in decentralizedKIYOMIZU-DERA

Kiyomizu-dera with impressive veranda
The main hall of Kiyomizu-dera is notable for its vast veranda,
supported by hundreds of pillars, which juts out over the hillside
and offers impressive views of the Kyoto.
Otowa-no-taki with its three channels of water
Beneath the main hall is the waterfall Otowa-no-taki, where three
channels of water drop into a pond. Visitors to the temple collect
the water, which is believed to have therapeutic properties, from
the waterfall in metal cups. It is said that drinking the water of
the three streams confers health, longevity, and success in studies.
The temple complex contains several other shrines, notably Jishu-jinja, dedicated.

When I was asked to review a book about “Subbuteo,” I thought I had been the victim of some sort of autocorrect. From there, my mind searched for memories of perhaps some Brazilian or Argentine defensive midfielder from the sixties …  … While both players are great, Trent Richardson is the biggest household name, as he went to New York this season as a Heisman finalist. Richardson rushed for 1,679 yards and 21 touchdowns for the Tide in 2011 and finishes his Alabama career with 3,860 total yards and 42 total touchdowns. Richardson is ranked as the top running back in the 2012 draft class by CBSSports.com, and is projected to go in the first five picks of the draft.
As for cornerback Dre Kirkpatrick, he's not exactly a slouch. Kirkpatrick had 29 tackles and broke up 9 passes this season while also forcing 2 fumbles. He did not have an interception in 2011, but that's because opposing quarterbacks tested him as little as possible. CBSSports.com has Kirkpatrick ranked as the second best cornerback prospect in the 2012 draft, behind only LSU's Morris Claiborne. He's expected to go within the first ten picks of our mock draft.
So if it wasn't already clear, this is a lot of talent leaving Tuscaloosa early, and it doesn't even include the seniors like Courtney Upshaw and Mark Barron that are graduating. Of course, this is where we point out that Alabama had four players drafted in the first round of last year's NFL Draft, and that loss of talent didn't stop the Crimson Tide from winning a national title this season..Windows/Mac/Linux: The final version of the Firefox is starting to show up on Mozilla's web site, and some readers are reporting update notices. Here are a few links and how-tos you should check out before downloading that browser.
- Add-on Compatibility Center - See whether the popular extensions that make up 95% of add-on downloads are compatible with Firefox 3.5 before you download. It's looking pretty green and good at the moment, with the notable exception of Tab Mix Plus.
- Top 10 Firefox 3.5 Features - Breaking down the Private Browsing Mode, TraceMonkey JavaScript engine, little interface features, and bigger changes to the increasingly popular open-source web browser.
- Disable location-aware browsing and tab tearing - If those features sound more like privacy invasion and mouse-clenching hassle, respectively, they're pretty easy to turn off.
- Make your extensions work with (Firefox 3.5) - Originally written for the big (bigger?) Firefox 3.0 upgrade, but this little
about:configtweak should keep those extensions not yet upgraded working with 3.5 as well, assuming you don't mind potential bugs.
- Weave synchronization tool - Mozilla's experimental synchronization project only works with Firefox 3.5—but, wait, that's out now! It's worth checking out, especially if you're running Firefox across multiple systems.
- Firefox 3.5 Overview - It's both a video run-through of Firefox 3.5's features, and a test of the new no-Flash-needed video powers of Firefox 3.5 (non-HTML5-compliant browsers will just get an .ogv video download link).

There are some in the administration, probably as window dressing, like Shinseki (with whom Obama never met in the last two years until the VA blow-up); doubtful that he had any input into this mega-blow-up.
And this guy:

On the other hand — did he even tell them? Or just HRC?

Re: “Camping ordinance helps us address needs of Denver’s homeless [1],” July 21 Perspective article by Albus Brooks, Denver City Council member.
As seven-year residents of LoDo, my wife and I have seen the number of homeless campers in our neighborhood double since the city’s camping ban went into effect.
Perhaps the most frustrating aspect of this problem is the police and city government apathy towards this problem. In the past three months, I have called the police 10 to 12 times to request that they remove people who are obviously camping (sleeping on benches with cardboard and sleeping bags). The dispatcher is very polite, listens to the complaint, says a policeman will be dispatched, and the end result is no police response occurs.
If Brooks feels the camping ban is working, I suggest he come down any night to 15th Street between Blake and Wazee and observe the scene. There are six benches and every one of them is occupied by early evening. If that is “working,” I would like to know what the definition of “not working” is.

#1 Comment By peterpi On July 30, 2013 @ 6:03 pm
1) Homeless people bother merchants and visitors in a section of downtown.
2) Said merchants and visitors raise their concerns with the mayor or city council.
3) Mayor, city council, and police agree that “something must be done”.
4) Homeless are shooed out of that section of downtown and settle elsewhere.
5) Repeat steps 1) through 4)
A decade ago, there was a crackdown on the homeless people downtown. I lived hear 1st and Broadway at the time, and the number of homeless people sleeping in building entrances, on street benches, etc., increased dramatically for a while, along with the detritus of their sojourning.
Despite high-minded speeches by city officials and downtown civic improvement associations, there’s no interest in truly trying to resolve why most people are homeless, and a small fraction are homeless because they can’t abide society’s rules and regulations. So, we shuffle them around.
The more things change, the more they stay the same.
#2 Comment By Steve R On July 31, 2013 @ 7:01 am
If only we would find the root cause and use this logic to solve other issues in society. Unfortunately somebody typically loses money if the problem gets solved (see Al Sharpton) so the real cause of the issue is never addressed.
#3 Comment By peterpi On July 31, 2013 @ 2:04 pm
The answer to why every problem exists is not “Al Sharpton”.
1) There’s Al Sharptons among the conservatives as well, but you would never admit that.
2) If/when problems get solved, the Al Sharptons of the left and right simply move on to other issues.
3) Is Al Sharpton also the root cause of why halitosis continues to exist, necessitating payments to the toothpaste and mouthwash industries? Is he the root cause of continuing air pollution in industrial countries? Is he the real reason behind the recent spate of massive solar storms and flares?Wendy’s Launches 'Claim Your Taste' Digital Experience [1]

Hill’s Science Diet High Energy Dog Food receives the Advisor’s mid-tier rating of 3 stars.
The Hill’s Science Diet High Energy product line includes one dry dog food.
However, since we’re unable to locate AAFCO nutritional adequacy statements for these dog foods on the company’s website, it’s impossible for us to report specific life stage recommendations for these recipes.
Hill's Science Diet High Energy
Dry Dog Food
Estimated Dry Matter Nutrient Content
Ingredients: Whole grain corn, chicken by-product meal, animal fat (preserved with mixed tocopherols and citric acid), dried beet pulp, soybean oil, lactic acid, dried egg product,
Fiber (estimated dry matter content) = 1 lactic acid, a compound found naturally in many living organisms. It’s likely added here to adjust the pH of the product which (in turn) reduces the growth of unwanted biological contaminants. High Energy Dog Food
The Bottom Line
Judging by its ingredients alone, Hill’s Science Diet High Energy Dog Food looks like a below-average dry product.
But ingredient quality by itself cannot tell the whole story. We still need to estimate the product’s meat content before determining a final rating.
The dashboard displays a dry matter protein reading of 30%, a fat level of 27% and estimated carbohydrates of about 35%.
And a fat-to-protein ratio of about 91%.
Near-average protein. Above-average fat. And below-average carbs when compared to a typical dry dog food.
Even when you consider the protein-boosting effect of the flaxseed, this looks like the profile of a kibble containing a moderate amount of meat.
Bottom line?
Hill’s Science Diet High Energy is a plant-based dry dog food using a moderate amount of chicken by-product meal as its main source of animal protein, thus earning the brand 3 stars.
Recommended.
However, with 27% of the total calories in this recipe coming from fat versus just 30% from protein, this food may not be suitable for every animal./29/2014 Last UpdateFind local services, events, restaurants and much more

Information regarding the recall was posted by Sony to its website. The issue with the Vaio Fit 11A computers is the non-removable battery packs. These pack were provided by a third party and have a risk of overheating. Computers affected by the faulty battery packs were released in February 2014 and can burn or catch fire.
Sony doesn’t yet have a plan together for recalling the affected models, but it is expected to have one ready in the next couple of weeks. When the recall plan is launched, owners of affected products will be able to have their computers fixed free of charge or will be refunded for the cost of the item. Until then, the company advises everyone with a Vaio Fit 11A to “discontinue use, shut down and unplug the PC.”
Owners can check their computers to see if they are one of the affected models by removing the tablet part of the computer. The laptop stand for the tablet will have a product name on the upper-left corner of the case. Computers included in the recall have a product name of “SVF11N1XXXX.”Under court order to pay $17.5 million of what could soon be a $70 million debt the city of New Orleans owes to its firefighters' pension fund, City Councilwoman Stacy Head looked to at least stop the bleeding.
She suggested taking $2 million from the Police Department's 2014 budget surplus and asking Mayor Mitch Landrieu to furlough Fire Department employees for one day a month for the rest of the year. Combined, she said, those two measures would at least stop the city's debt to the fund from growing every month.
Should she bring it before her colleagues Thursday and they approve it in August, Landrieu's spokesman said the mayor wouldn't veto such a measure.
But her plan barely begins to scrape away at the pension payment shortfall that began in 2010 when Landrieu took office.
Do you think Head's strategy is a viable one? Should the city look to cut services to pay the pension debt? How would you handle it if you were mayor for a day?

The incoming freshman class for the 2010 high school softball season came to a West Mifflin Area program that had struggled in previous years.
They arrived during coach Casey Phillips' second season with the team. The prior season, the Titans finished 2-10 and in last place in Section 3-AAA.
The future Class of 2013 featured four players who would become four-year starters and help transform the program. Last season, during their senior year, four-year starters Amanda Leschak, Sydnei Zalice, Marla Small and Kaylyn Andress, helped lead West Mifflin to a share of the Section 3-AAA title and to the WPIAL semifinals.
The foursome has since graduated, but the bar has been raised. The 2014 Titans are postseason bound for the second consecutive year. Through Tuesday, West Mifflin was 12-2 overall and sitting atop Section 3-AAA with a 7-2 section record ahead of Southmoreland (8-4, 6-3) and Elizabeth Forward (9-5, 6-3).
"It has been a real exciting year so far," Phillips said. "We graduated four four-year starters. Those four came in as freshmen and bought into everything that myself and the coaches were preaching. It all came together for them their senior year."
The graduations of Leschak, Zalice, Small and Andress left holes at center field, second base, shortstop and third base but West Mifflin returned five other starters.
"We have a good combination of kids coming back and some young kids who put themselves in a position in the offseason to be ready to play," Phillips said.
West Mifflin opened section play with a 1-0 win at Belle Vernon Area on March 27, but fell to 1-1 in section play with a 6-2 loss at Elizabeth Forward the next day. Since then the Titans have won nine of 10, including a 6-4 win against Elizabeth Forward last week. In the win against Elizabeth Forward, West Mifflin overcame a 4-0 deficit to score five runs in the sixth inning. Alyssa Cairnis' two-run triple was the difference in the game.
Senior pitcher Paige Flore had 15 strikeouts to help West Mifflin snap a four-game losing streak to the Warriors.
"We are healthy and I think we are hitting our stride," Phillips said. "The EF game was really big. That is always a big game with those guys, it has become a neighborhood rivalry.
"We were down early, but instead of folding, our girls rose to the occasion. They were focused and they believed and they knew how important of a game it was going to be for us."
Flore is a four-year starter at pitcher and one of the best in the WPIAL. Through 13 games she is 11-2 with 117 strikeouts in 89 innings with an ERA of 0.94.
"My wife was at the EF game and when we came home she told me, 'Paige Flore is the most intense human being I have ever seen' and that is not downplaying it at all," Phillips said.
"She is a fiery ballplayer. She is physically tough and mentally tough. She is a great leader. It is a luxury having one of the best pitchers in the WPIAL."
The other half of the battery is Cairins, a junior catcher in the midst of a monster season at the plate. She is batting .489 with 19 RBIs and 14 runs. Senior Crystal Cook is a four-year starter at first base. She is batting .386 with 16 RBIs.
Junior Lauren Ackerman was the designated player last year and she moves to second base this season. Out of the cleanup spot in the order, Ackerman is batting .327 with 13 RBIs and a home run. Batting behind Ackerman are two new starters, sophomore shortstop Amber Cook and junior third baseman Kacey Larson.
A trio of juniors starts in the outfield, left fielder Shannon Davis, center fielder Chelsea Hess and right fielder Taylor Lapko. Hess started in right field last season but moved to center this season. Davis and Lapko are also returning starters.
"The four seniors we graduated last year did a lot to change the culture of the program," Phillips said. "Our kids now have bought into it and we have great senior leadership."
The senior leadership is provided by Flore, Cook and senior designated player Brooke Lowe.
"The seniors have carried the torch that those four did last year," Phillips said. "The seniors are here to win and they have a bunch of other kids buying into it and following their example."Seattle Catholic : A Journal of Catholic News and Views text web site 20050422 20050502 eng electronic application/x-javascript image/gif image/jpeg text/css text/html born digital Seattle Catholic : A Journal of Catholic News and Views.

This is the result of kicking new mothers out of the hospital so soon after delivery. Early lactation support can help, but in the hospital, nurses are availabe to a new mother in the middle of the night, which doesn't happen (so often) out in the community..

Ever since we have had drive by deliveries it has been difficult for new moms to breast feed their babies. They need help getting started and feeling comfortable. It is best if the person helping has breastfed their own babies and isn't a zealot. I helped my daughters when they breastfed their first child because no one had told them the really easy to do "tricks of the trade" like getting the whole areola into the baby’s mouth by expressing milk if it is too full. This gets the pressure where it should be and keeps the mother’s nipples from being hurt. That is just one example of something that really makes a difference in successful nursing..

I agree. I nursed 3 children each for a year without much difficulty. I had 2 visits from a Lacation consultant in the hospital for my first and 1 minute encounters with them for my subsequent children. There probably are not enough lactation consultants employed in the hospitals. 1 or 2 covers day shift and they are not available on Nights...The floor nurses do not have the time (or experience as many are young and have not even had children yet!) to devote to new moms when they are bogged down with documentation on their 10-12 patients they are assigned to. I think hospitals need to invest in more lacation consulants-or even think about employing experienced mothers who were successful in breastfeeding to follow up and support new moms throughout at least the first 2 months, if not longer..

Some pediatricians are no help to new moms either! I know of one mother who was told her baby was "allergic" to her milk so she stopped nursing. Babies are NOT allergic to mother milk, they may be allergic to something she is eating that is getting into the milk but with a little coaching and dietary changes, something like that can be resolved. Also for women who quit because of the babies gastric difficulties, young women need to be taught not to eat spicy hot wings or onions on their cheeseburgers when they are nursing. Much of it is common sense (which seems to be in short supply these days) I had no one to turn to-my mother and mother in law and my sister in law all bottle fed, (in the 50's and 60's when women were told formula was better for babies so my mother and MIL didnt breast feed at all), so I had to learn by myself. My mother was frantic and wanted to buy a scale to weigh my oldest before and after feeding because it drove her crazy that you couldnt see how much fluid the baby was getting although he was obviously sated and gaining weight. New mothers also need to be educated that breast milk doesnt form as hard a curdle in a babies stomach and that feeding every hour or so early on is normal compared to bottle fed babies who sleep longer. When they compare their baby who wakes every hour or two to feed and a formula baby who sleeps 3-4 hours at a time, it looks good to a breast mom that if she feeds formula, she can sleep more! They need to be educated on how to feed but also why it is better for their baby. Many young women do not have breast feeding relatives-I did not. I learned all I knew by reading. I breast fed my oldest until he was 2 1/2 and began asking for it in public and my youngest (who was a difficult feeder due to the nurses giving him sugar water bottles in the nursery) I managed to feed about 9 months but I went back to regular full time work after he was born so he got both bottle and breast. It takes education. I agree that a lactation consultant sent to the home at the critical times is more beneficial than getting it in the hospital when you are so bombarded with info and you are not feeling well yourself. If a woman had a lactation consultant, she would be better informed and wouldnt be as gullable when some old school pediatrician tries to tell her that her baby is allergic to breast milk!!.

Ross, it sounds like the "consultants" that saw your wife were zealots and should not have been in this business. My youngest did fine on a combination of breast milk and formula. It was necessary due to my schedule and I felt like he was at least getting some good effects of breast milk and it gave us "mommy/baby" time. I'm glad that I was never berated for having to use formula! I'm sorry your wife was subject to that kind of treatment and good for you for getting them out of there. She didnt need that sort of judgement and extra stress. It is a shame because there are good LC's out there (just none came to your wife, it sounds like) Most of the ones I was in contact with felt "some breast milk is better than no breast milk" but someone should not be berated or belittled if they choose not to breast feed at all. There are a generation of us who grew up on formula and I think we turned out okay! It should be a woman's choice. I knew from the time that I was a little girl that I wanted to breast feed my own children and being an RN, I knew what benefits it gives but that doesnt make formula babies at a disadvantage. I do know that the son who was more exclusively breast fed had a lot less illness, allergies and ear infections than the one who was both bottle and breast, so I know the benefits of breast feeding are truly there. Some women are able to breast feed naturally and some need a little more help. It is a skill to be learned. You would think something so essential would come naturally but it doesnt always do so. When people lived in larger family groups, there were more female relatives who could help a new mother. Our family dynamics have changed so it makes it necessary to have people like "lactation consultants" but like every other professional, there are good ones and bad ones..Beijing, China (PRWEB) September 12, 2013

At the start of the off-season, the big focus was on the options of Paul Maholm, Ryan Doumit, Chris Snyder, and Ronny Cedeno. The Pirates declined all four options, much to the dismay of Pirates fans, who didn’t think the team could replace those four players on the free agent market.
The Pirates replaced Cedeno with Clint Barmes, who grades as one of the best defensive shortstops in the league on pretty much every defensive metric. They replaced the injury prone duo of Doumit and Snyder with Rod Barajas, who has much better defense than Doumit, and who has caught more innings than any catcher in the majors the last few years. They replaced Maholm with the high-risk, high-reward Erik Bedard.
The Pirates declined about $33 M in player options, and replaced those four players with $19 M in payroll. For the sake of argument, you could say that the Pirates made lateral movements at each position, while saving $14 M in payroll in the process. The set of moves leaves the Pirates with an estimated payroll of $46 M, with talk that they could afford expand that number to the $55 M range. That’s plenty of room for a big contract.
The reason I find the off-season amusing is because of a trend that exists every off-season. The deeper you get in to the off-season, the more pessimistic Pirates fans get. At the start of the off-season the Pirates couldn’t compete without players like Maholm, Doumit, Snyder, and Cedeno. By the end of the winter meetings they had replaced those players with new additions that you could call lateral movements. Even though they had the same talent level at each position, it was no longer enough. The Pirates needed more in order to compete. At the start of the off-season the Pirates couldn’t compete without Maholm, Doumit, and Cedeno. They added players with similar overall values in Bedard, Barajas, and Barmes, but didn’t seem to escape the “100 loss” predictions that were around during OptionGate.
The team has been quiet since the winter meetings. Since the Casey McGehee trade on December 12th they’ve added nine minor league free agents, none of which really stand to make an impact in the majors. They also still have an estimated $46 M payroll, which leaves room for a big signing. That brings us to one of the most amusing things of all in my book.
It seems like no matter what the Pirates do, the 2012 predictions don’t change. Lose Maholm, Doumit, and Cedeno? They’ll lose 100 games. Replace those three with Bedard, Barajas, and Barmes? That’s fine for a week, but a week later when they haven’t made any additional moves they’re back to losing 100 games. I understand the pessimism. The Pirates have lost a lot of years in a row. They’ve had can’t miss prospects who missed. They’ve been presented with rebuilding plans, but never saw a rebuild. They saw the freak show in 1997, and they saw the 2011 team capture first place in July, only to go on to finish the season with the worst case scenario of a collapse. You can’t even say that Pirates fans need to see proof of something before they’ll believe in it, because at this point they’re just waiting for the other shoe to drop.
The Pirates have room to spend in 2012. They have room to make a big addition to the team and still end up in the $55 M range. What’s amusing is that the Pirates are a 100 loss team if they don’t make such a move, but an addition of someone like Edwin Jackson suddenly makes them a team that can compete. One of those things isn’t right, and I’m guessing the never-changing, pessimistic 100 loss prediction is that thing. Either the Pirates are a team that could have a shot at contending with an addition like Edwin Jackson, or they’re just wasting their money because they’re far from one player away from doing anything.
It’s pretty important to know which side you stand on that debate, because it will influence your answer to this next question: Does a big free agent make sense for the Pirates?
Last week I pointed out that the Pirates were in a rare situation where there were still talented free agents available, and the Pirates were one of the few teams with money to spend. I suggested Edwin Jackson as a possibility. Most of the arguments for a free agent focus on the 2012 payroll. They don’t focus on whether the team can afford a long term deal. So I looked in to it. I completed estimates of the 2013, 2014, and 2015 payrolls, to get an idea of whether the Pirates have room in their future payrolls for a big deal, such as $10 M a year for Edwin Jackson.
If you assume that the Pirates stick in the $50-55 M payroll range during those years, then they could manage such a contract. They’d have to trim some payroll in 2013, something I think will already happen, as I don’t see them keeping Joel Hanrahan for a third year of arbitration. In 2014 and 2015 they’d need top prospects like Gerrit Cole, Jameson Taillon, Alex Dickerson, Tony Sanchez, and others to arrive, which would help keep prices down.
The Pirates could afford a big deal, but they’re in a situation where there’s one bullet in the chamber. Do you fire that the first chance you get? Or do you save it for an absolute emergency?
I like Edwin Jackson. He’s a very talented pitcher. He would be the ace of the Pirates staff for at least the next two years. But he’s a 3.8 WAR pitcher. The guy he’d replace would be Kevin Correia, who was a replacement level pitcher last year. So the overall impact would be 3-4 extra wins. If you’re in the 100 loss camp, it wouldn’t make any sense to spend money on Jackson. You’d be tying up the payroll for the next few years, and if you think the team is that bad in 2012, then the addition of Jackson probably won’t do anything in the short term.
But what about if you think the team is close? What if you think the team is a 72-75 win team? You could argue that the Pirates would be better off waiting until they had a winning season before adding a free agent. Maybe the Pirates could use that $10 M per year at another position in the future. You could also make the argument that I’ve made: Jackson would be the best pitcher on the team for the next two years, and would either be a great number three behind Taillon and Cole, or would be someone who could easily be traded if other options emerge.
The Pirates have the payroll space for a big addition, but they only have one shot. If they add someone who gets hurt or regresses, they lose that payroll flexibility in the future. It might be irrelevant to talk about Jackson, since it looks like he’s going for a one year deal with a contender. But when talking about Jackson you have to ask: With one shot to take, is this the guy you want to take that shot on? Or do you wait until the team has a winning season before you make that type of move?

Ridgid 52 RPM 300 Compact Pipe Threading Machine w/ 250 stand 75602
Heavy Duty applications are welcomed with the Ridgid 52 RPM 300 Compact Pipe Threading Machine w/ 250 stand 75602 . This threader is a proven heavy duty performer and is ideal for applications that require a lot of field work, because it can easily be used in correlation with service trucks and in-house maintenance. Finally, the 75602 is a threader that is able to be on the go with you, thanks to it’s portable design that weighs in at only 115 pounds individually, or only a total of 160 pounds with stand, all in all, making it one of the lightest most portable 2″ threaders in the Ridgid product line. Fast transport and set up are a highlighting design factor with the threader and becomes a true advantage out on the worksite.
Versatile
The 300 Compact Threader really shines as a versatile tool, as it can be fitted with an optional 916 groover adapter bracket to accept the 300 power drive version of the 916 model, this adapter allows the machine to groove 2″-6″ pipe. Furthermore, Rigdgid’s 75602 is so smooth and quiet that you would never be able to guess that inside this melodic threader was a heavy duty rotor, the true heart of a beast. Another additional feature of the 75602 is that this threader runs on a self-contained oil system, which has a through the head integral oil reservoir and an adjustable flow control. The threader has been approved accordingly by CSA and UL standards. Finally, the Compact Threader 300 has a spindle speed that runs at 52 RPM’s and it’s chuck is a hammer-type with a replaceable, rocker-action jaw inserts and a self-priming, constant-flow, gerotor pump.

"I suppose I could have gone out there and gotten another job, but I knew two to five years down the line, I'd probably be looking for another one," says Frederic Holdsworth, a former CFO for a manufacturing company and a current franchisee for AlphaGraphics.
When the company Holdsworth worked for decided to move its operations to Malaysia, Holdsworth helped shut down its Massachusetts base, laying off many workers before being let go himself this June. With severance package in hand, Holdsworth, 41, decided not to find another finance position. Instead, he looked into franchising. This September, he opened the doors to his Manchester, New Hampshire, printing franchise.
In an uncertain economy, Holdsworth's story is fairly common. "When people are laid off, they typically try to get employed by other companies in the same industry, only to find those [companies] are cutting back as well," says Don Boroian, president of Olympia Fields, Illinois-based Francorp Inc., a franchise consulting firm. "After a month or two of sending out resumes to no avail, they begin looking at business opportunities and convert their severance pay to capitalization for a franchise."
Dana Hobson had been looking into franchising even before she was laid off from her job with Time-Life. Wanting to start a family, Hobson's husband, Linc, a former lobbyist, suggested the couple move from suburban Washington, DC, back to his hometown of Peoria Heights, Illinois. "There's not much lobbying to do in Peoria, so if we wanted to move back there, we knew we would need to start our own business," explains Hobson, 34.
When the books division Hobson worked for closed down, she and her husband put their full effort into finding a franchise, reasoning it would provide more security than just another corporate job. "The benefit [of franchising] is the ultimate control over your work and your income," she says. "Obviously, the benefits of [working for a] company are you get your paycheck every two weeks and your 401(k), but tomorrow they can tell you, 'We're laying you off.'"
In 2001, Hobson used her severance package to purchase a Home Instead Senior Care franchise, a business that provides nonmedical care to senior citizens. She and her husband operate the franchise together, a move that gives them the freedom to spend more time with their 6-month-old baby.
Jeff Huber, vice president of franchise development for Home Instead, is seeing more people like the Hobsons show interest in his franchise. "We've noticed a marked increase in inquiries from people who have a severance package or have been downsized and are looking into small-business ownership," he says. "I would say one in five to one in six people who buy a franchise in our system have a severance package, whereas a year or so ago it was one in 10 to 15."
According to Huber, these prospective entrepreneurs are looking for something in franchising they couldn't find in the corporate world. "They've spent the past 20 or so years working for kind of a nameless, faceless corporation, and now they want to control their own destiny," he says.
Holdsworth agrees. Although his shop has only been open since the end of August, he's already noticed some major advantages to being self-employed. "If I'm going to work a lot of horrendous hours and put in a tremendous effort, I'd just as soon do it for myself as opposed to someone else," he says.
Don DeBolt, president of the International Franchise Association, sees other fringe benefits for people looking to invest their severance in a franchise: "It offers an opportunity to match your interests and skills with a business that has already been proved."
Franchising, according to Huber, also offers a wiser investment. "People who have been downsized or have a severance have the option to take the money and maybe invest it in the stock market, but they don't feel like they have control over the stock market or the factors that affect [it]," he says. "If they invest it in themselves and their own business, that's something they feel they have control over. All the sweat equity they put into the business falls directly to their bottom line and is building an asset for them."
DeBolt agrees that franchising is "a wonderful way to diversify a person's investment portfolio, particularly when we have a stock market that's not too predictable."
Not that owning a franchise is a small undertaking. As Holdsworth and Hobson have found, being a franchisee requires not only a sizable financial investment, but a great deal of time and energy as well. For Hobson, knowing she's working for herself does make the long hours worthwhile. "You may have to work at night or on weekends," she says, "but you get to make that decision yourself."Øvstedal, D.O. and Gremmen, N.J.M. (2001) The lichens of Marion and Prince Edward Islands. South African Journal of Botany, 67, 552-572. ISSN 0254-6299.
Official URL:
A total of 100 lichen species are listed for the islands. Six species are described as new to science: Arctomia subantarctica Øvstedal, Arthothelium evanescens Øvstedal, Coccotrema stellata Øvstedal, Ramonia subantarctica Øvstedal, Thelocarpon subantarcticum Øvstedal and Verrucaria umbilicata Øvstedal. Four new combinations are made: Amandinea subplicata (Nyl.) Øvstedal, Poeltinula cerebrinella (Nyl.) Øvstedal, Verrucaria nigra (Müll. Arg.) Øvstedal (from Cape Horn) and Verrucaria tesselata (Dodge) Øvstedal (from Heard Island). One third of the islands' lichen species also occur in the Northern Hemisphere. Of the Southern Hemisphere species, 24 are exclusively known from areas to the east of the islands (Kerguelen Province Islands, Australia, New Zealand, contrasting to only six species recorded exclusively to the west (South Georgia, Antarctic Peninsula). This suggests a distribution against the present predominantly westerly winds. The large number of seemingly endemic species is suggested to indicate the incomplete knowledge of the lichen floras of the sub-Antarctic islands.

The Effects of Ambien Use
With similar actions to the benzodiazepines, Ambien—trade name for zolpidem—is frequently utilized as a short-term sleep aid; taking Ambien in doses and durations in excess of those prescribed can result in dependency and numerous ill effects..
Tolerance to the effects of Ambien can occur, especially if taken for durations longer than advised by a medical professional. Increasing the dose to compensate for this tolerance compounds potentially dangerous side effects.
The abuse headaches, memory loss, persistent drowsiness and gastrointestinal disturbances such as nausea for several hours after waking the next morning. Additionally, there exist numerous reports of somnambulism (sleepwalking) and a bizarre phenomenon known as night eating syndrome—or sleep eating—that may occur, especially in the context of multiple doses. If you’re suffering from any of these short-term effects because of an addiction to Ambien, and want information about available treatment help, call 1-800-943-0566 to speak with a confidential treatment support specialist
Short-term side effects of Ambien abuse can include persistent daytime drowsiness and redness of the eyes. More alarming is the potential for developing tolerance and a dangerous withdrawal syndrome that can include cognitive impairment and seizures.. Similar to the benzodiazepine class of medication, following long-term dependency, these withdrawal symptoms can be quite dangerous and can include:
- Sweating
- Fatigue
- Intractable insomnia
- Irritability
- Stomach cramps
- Panic attacks
- Delirium
- Seizure
Medically assisted detox can be administered under supervision to help mitigate the discomfort and dangers of Ambien withdrawal.
A professional Ambien rehab center can help you recover from your addiction. Additionally, these treatment centers can provide medically supervised detox to monitor a precarious period of withdrawal from the medication. Your doctor can help lessen the detox effects, make you feel as comfortable as possible but, most importantly, monitor you for any of the potentially life-threatening symptoms of Ambien withdrawal. If you experience any of the troubling side effects of short or long-term Ambien use or you think you are dependent on the drug, call us at 1-800-943-0566. We know that, especially after prolonged use, Ambien might seem like something that you need, but we can connect you with a detox center that can help you put your addiction behind you.Below are top resources on SparkPeople for Remedies

It's a small world
When you're wrapped up in hate.
Think of the things you're missing:
Friendships with people who are
Different from you;
Different colors, different attitudes, different lives.
What else is missing?
Loving family relationships,
Can't tolerate someone
You can't control, can you?
Much less love them.
What about a mate?
Out of the question.
How can you love a woman
When you don't respect yourself?
I hope, dear brother,
That your hate keeps you warm.
Because as long as you keep it
Wrapped around you
Nothing else will.

[Aside: There was a picture of Fiona Apple on the cover of some teen mag circa 1998 that also looked wicked like that dead baby, and it totally gave me nightmares after seeing the mag at 7-11. Yeah, I was in college. Got a problem with that?]
Ah, not much plot in this one. All the BSC take an infant care class because Kristy has to take one in order to take a regular job with the Prezziosos. And Kristy gets a perfect score. Woo-hoo. So, afterwards, there are lots of sitting jobs involving actual babies. And don't forget the titular Stoneybrook Baby Parade which only rolls around every other year. Apparently, the Baby Parade consists of assholes spending lots of money and effort on dragging a bunch of floats, wagons, strollers and screaming bebbies (3 and under) around d-town Stoneybrook. [Seriously, the fuck? A baby parade? Really? If these things really happen, I need to smack someone. Cause gathering that many infants in one place could be dangerous? Am I the only one who's seen that episode of the Simpsons with the baby-riots?] And the BSC decide to make a float and bring NINE BABIES (!!!!!?????!!!!!!) on it. That's five 13-year-olds and two 11-year-olds and a shit-ton of brats. (Oh, and Logan and Shannon get roped into watching all the older siblings of the babies.) But the BSC don't work together, so they wind up humiliating themselves and Saint Charlie, who gets roped into dragging the float along behind his car. Oh, and Kristy has to help Mrs. Prezzioso with her entry, though she really doesn't do too much. I'm still not even sure why that's in there. Cause K's all worried she'll get fired from her regular job if Baby Prezzioso doesn't win first place or something. Great, bounding leaps of logic here. Oh, and the big fight ends. What?
Blah. Stupid babies.
- Most ironically meta first sentence ever: "Okay, I admit it. I was bored."
- Wait, Kristy occasionally gets bored while sitting? Perhaps she's not a robot after all.
- Nanny's "husband died years ago." Dontcha just love how these girls talk about their dead relatives?
- Kristy on Emily Michelle [PS-Why do they usually call her by her first and middle name? It's not like there's another Emily in the fam.]: "She's adorable. Did I already tell you that? Well, she is. I looked at her glossy, straight black hair cut like a Dutch girl's. [The fuck?] I looked at her sparkling brown almond-shaped eyes. I looked at her plump, pink cheeks and at her sturdy little hands [huh?]...and at her round little tummy." Um, is it just me or is this vaguely creepy?
- Woo! Second week in a row mentioning the Red Sox.
- Gotta love vaguely bitchy pseudo-compliments: "Mary Anne tends to dress a little more stylishly than I do--there are times when she actually looks cool, which I never do." Um. Nice?
- Claud is "always up on the latest trend, whether it's big black shoes, tie-dyed leggings, or cool hats." Big black shoes never go out of style. They are not a trend. They are a way of life. Sure, there are times when they are harder to find, and that sucks.
- Pretzels are not boring. They are a wonderful snack food that happens to not be crappy for you. (Though, dipped in Nutella, they're definitely more on the junk food tip.)
- Lame! The BSCers wear their BSC t-shirts (totally forgot about these) to the infant care class.
- Hee. The woman teaching the class, Anita, has a "partner" named Don, and all the BSCers get a crush on him. Though, for some reason, that dissipates when they realize he's a dad. But not in a "I am NOT old enough to date someone with kids!" way. Or a "Great, now I have to be nice to his brats" way. I am a horrible person.
- Yes, in a room full of parents and parents-to-be, Kristy is the only one to think that a wailing baby might need a diaper change.
- There's this weird interjection about cloth diapers being better for the environment.
- A man is the only person other than Kristy to get a perfect score on their evaluations. And everyone is surprised. Cause, yeah.
- I don't care if Candy Land is boring, Kristy. You're the fucking babysitter. Get over yourself.
- "Andrea 'startled' at the noise. Anita had told us about that reflex. Babies do it when they hear a sudden sound. Her whole body seemed to jump, and her eyes flew wide open." Yeah, that happens to me pretty much ALL THE TIME. ADULTS STARTLE, TOO! I don't get the point of including this little tidbit. At all.
- Um, I really hate Jessi's handwriting. Way too flowy.
- Claud's got a real doozy of an outfit: "an oversized red blouse with black buttons, green leggings with white, tie-dyed streaks, and black high-top sneakers with all kinds of buckles and snaps on them." She's literally dressed like a watermelon. To the point that she's wearing watermelon earrings. FUUUUUUUUUG!
- Jamie Newton says "liberry." I suppose I should forgive him, because he's a fictional four-year-old. But fuck that. I hate when people say that!!!!! Somebody get me a wire hanger!
- Tra-la-la. All babies are so-oooooooooooo cute. [GAG.]
- All the girls have really fucking lame ideas for the float: baby baseball, baby surfing, baby kittens (with Tigger on the float), babies in New York, babies as Misty of Chincoteague, babies from outer space." Retarded.
- The theme they finally choose is "The Old Woman Who Lived in a Shoe." Or, as Claudia spells it on the actual signs on the float: "Their was an old womman who lived in a sho," and "Thair was an old womann who lived in a shue." How does she spell really easy words differently at the same time? It makes my head hurt!!!!
- Oh, yeah. There's this whole thing about how Jenny wants to be in the parade with Andrea. Cause we care.
- Ah, in ancient times when Elmo "isn't on very often, so Squirt has to watch carefully in order to catch him." Now, you can watch Elmo jack off in Target. Aren't you glad we're alive now?
- The baby costumes are bright pink, and they clash horribly with the orangey-red of the shoe. I'm surprised that no one combines those colors in an outfit later in the book.
- The grand marshall of the parade is some old-timey cowboy named Slim Peabody. And Kristy ponders, "Why couldn't they have gotten somebody like Cam Geary to lead the parade?" Um, because cool and or genuinely famous people don't HOST FUCKING BABY PARADES IN SMALL TOWN CONNECTICUT! Whew. Sorry.
- So, the parade is a fucking disaster for the BSC. They actually failed at something involving with children. My world is collapsing around me. At this time of trouble, I need my friends for support. Too bad I'm not a member of the BSC. They are the best friends I'll (n)ever have.
- Babies dressed up like Star Wars characters...yeah. AKA, these dorks have way too much time on their hands. [Shut up! I...um...am sadly shaking my head in resignation.]
- Blah, fight's over. Oooh, communication.
Damn. That was a ridiculous one.

Babies as Misty of Chincoteague? Whose stupid idea was that? I am looking at you, Mallory Pike.
Anyone know what happened to those AWESOME BSC stories on fanfiction.net that were all about Mallory growing up and being pathetic and oblivious? Those were pretty much the best thing ever.
Ha, I remember the watermelon outfit. I once actually tried to imitate it....I was such a dork.
But you're right this book did suck, I read it a few times, but pretty much hated it. It was probably realistic, but boring.
I think this is the book that made me just quit reading BSC when I was a kid, b/c bits of it sound familiar, but not all of it, like is the case with most of the other ones I'd read that you've reviewed. Hmmm...must have been pretty horrendous to get me to want to purge myself of the BSC.
oh god, i thought the exact same thing when kristy made that cam geary comment. shut up, kristy.
agree that that description of emily was way too detailed and unnecessary and just boring. emily's cute, we get it.
can't believe charlie still dragged their piece of crap behind his car when the whole town (i'm assuming?) was watching. no 17 year boy would do that. puh-leeze.
so much hate for this book! everyone is such a nerd (more so than usual...)
As soon as I saw the cover I was like "orange and pink and clashing!"
I was into the BSC for way longer than I should have been (and I mean that I was serious into it, and once when I was in college I wandered around a Bookman's and tried to find them because I wanted to see if the girls ever left middle school) and at some point I used to wonder if Charlie was hot. Did any of the girls have crushes on Kristy's brothers? Don't remember. Well, they should have.
Elmo and jacking off = priceless.
Stacey actually dated Kristy's brother Sam in some of the books. I remember them getting together in one of the superspecials...
I feel like this is your best review yet! I haven't read this book for (probably a very good) some reason and I was wondering if there was a mention of why the baby on the front cover had magical flying powers?
That was great. I just read your blog to my husband..he now wants me to read this book to him. The Elmo/jacking off comment was the best thing I read all day. Thankk for the laughs!!
But who won the BSC party gig with ANM?
The baby parade concept is very weird and creepy, but I have to admit I enjoy this book because the BSC failing miserably is a novelty when in the rest of the series they can do no wrong.
I love how they get Claudia to make the signs. Sure she's all artsy and creative, but they forgot that halfway illiterate!
aaah has anyone seen this?
Ann M Martin:Huuge Dyke
Seriously. She makes ALL their signs for them. Get a clue, BSC.
I hated this book, I used to get so frustrated with it.
That must happen a lot with the BSC though because I'm reading Mary Anne and Camp BSC at the moment and that's annoying me as well. I hate Karen and she appears in this one a lot so maybe that's why.
But regarding the Baby Parade? Bleurgh.
I can't believe I just found this site. I was sick this weekend, and I read through the entire thing giggling that I remembered so much. My best friend and I still occasionally talk about Stacy's Emergency and her reaching for the brownies.
Okay, vague memories of this book are now returning. I definitely remember that horrid cover! Yuck. But I was so jealous of Claud's watermelon outfit! I totally wanted one for myself.
My favourite thing about Claudia's watermelon outfit is that it prompts Jamie Newton to say "hey, you can help me with my halloween costume!" Take the hint, Claudia.
I agree with your comment about Jessi's handwriting being to flowy. It is. Whenever she writes, it takes me forever to figure out what's writing!!!
And this blog cracks me up. But it makes me wonder if you really dislike the BSC or you're really sarcastic. XD XD Great blog.
I totally had a crush on Kristy's brothers.
Did anyone ever have the BSC Dolls? I have this Mary-Anne doll, who had to be about 14-16 inches tall, and her limbs moved, but because she was a weird rubber she creaked... She wore a plaid skirt and red turtle neck with brown loafers. HOT.
~Emily
When I was in the 4th and 5th grade and still trying figure out my handwriting, I would mimic the writing styles of the BSCers!! My teachers must have been so confused because from one week to another I'd have handwriting that looked like Kristy, Mary Anne, Stacy, Dawn and Jessi. I never tried to do Claudia's handwriting b/c it was just too too sloppy. Interestingly enough, I think my handwriting now looks most like Mary Anne's.
I am going to go put my head in the oven now. I am a dork.
I think my husband is seriously worried about me because I've been re-reading the BSC books (I'm going through all the Super Specials first -- how many school vacations did these girls get?). Yes, I'll hide my need to re-read them from the world, but I have to hide it from him, too???
You mean that Kristy actually wears a DRESS in this one? That has to be her first dress since...what, her mom and Watson's wedding? Knowing her, though, she probably has jeans on under it.
I totally had the Dawn doll, and I remember being pissed because she was too big to wear Barbie clothes and shoes. I mean, what's the point of having a BSC doll if you can't dress it up in ridiculous outfits?
I totally tried to adopt Stacey's handwriting style in about the fourth or fifth grade, but I eventually grew out of it. (I think the hearts over the i's were the first to go, though I clung to the s's and e's for quite some time.) And my college roommate once confessed to me that her current handwriting style is a direct result of trying to imitate Dawn's. :-)
To paraphrase Homer Simpson, "This [book] was the suckiest suck that ever suck.
I know that several NJ towns have baby parades.
Ocean City supposedly has one of the nation's oldest baby parades. I find it slightly creepy
Wow, I remember this book. You inspired me to reread some of the books when I found your blog, and I am so past disturbed at the word "dibbly." I mean, why. Way to go, Ann M. Martin, for making me look like an ass when I tried to start my OWN Babysitter's Club at age 10...and nobody called. She failed to mention that most parents don't want to leave their kids in the hands of an elementary school student.
I TOTALLY TRIED TO COPY THEIR HANDWRITING. stacey's and kristy's were my favorites. even now (college sophomore), i'll try to write my cursive like kristy's.
OMG! My parents still tease me about putting up "Need a responsible, reliable sitter?" signs all over town when I was like 11. Why did she do that to us? ANM is a cruel, evil bitch.
I too tried to copy Stacey's handwriting! I loved how she wrote her a's, which looked so much more sophisticated than the basic "o" and "|" style of "a". I got rid of all my BSC books years ago (except for "The Truth About Stacey, which has no Stacey diary entries), so I can't tell if my handwriting has any lingering Staceyness.
This blog makes me want to hunt for BSC books at the second-hand bookstores here in Toronto. A few have BSC books.
Isn't that when you still had only the kind of cloth diapers that you had to fold different ways for a boy or a girl? Pins, oh my.
We use cloth diapers for our daughter, but we use the new snapping type, Fuzzi Bunz. No doubt that cloth is somewhat better simply becuase it's that much less trash you generate.
I would totally pay $$$ to see a bunch of junior high babysitters try to dress up babies like the wild ponies of Chincoteague. I'm imagining the float now...hiLARious.
my husband hasn't said anything about my recently rediscovered bsc addiction. I still can't bring myself to tell my friends though. However, today I brought a copy of the ghost at dawn's house to work to read on my lunch break... which I took outside, alone, where no one could see me... is this my dirty little secret?
I went to a wedding this weekend and the welcome basket was signed by the bride, and she dotted the "i" in her name with a HEART. She's over 30 years old. The first thing out of my mouth was, "What is this, the baby-sitters club?"
you know, you've all got me wondering now if my current handwriting isn't a direct result of BSC reading when I was younger.
Okay, confession time...many of you have confessed to imitating the handwriting of various BSCers. But I must admit I went one step further at the height of my BSC obsession...when I was younger I actually kept a DIARY that I thought of as my 'BSC Notebook'! I used to update it regularly with made up stories of 'sitting experiences'. Each entry was written using the handwriting of the particular BSC member whose experience it was. I think I still have it somewhere....
SAD!!!!!
So I'm now addicted to the site, but see you're missing a very important part of BSC Books--MYSTERIES! Those were my favorite as a child, and I'd love to see eat, chew and spit them out into wonderful entertainment. This is great.
For awhile I thought that dotting i's with hearts was totally awesome. My handwriting is terrible. It's the worst. So my i's with hearts just looked scary.
I also took a babysitting class through, like, school or something and was a certified babysitter for awhile. Hated it.
The only thing i remember about this book is during the parade Kristy describes bagpipes sounding like a bunch of hungry cats fighting over a piece of fish. I do not know why that is the only thing that stands out.
Also, my handwriting is also a direct result of attempting to imitate Dawn's.
This is the last BSC book I read. I bought it, read it in an hour or two, and couldn't believe how stupid it was. I decided dafter this book that I was done! I think I was about 11, and I remember thinking "what a waste of money!" I don't remember much of this book except that it was really dumb and that the BSC failed at something. The earlier books were so much better. Those damn ghostwriters!
Thanks to this site I just spent about $35 on Half.com buying old BSC books. You can suprisingly get a lot for that much money... (If they are from the same seller.)
I was totally in love with Charlie Thomas, I just imagined him as being so nice since he drove around all these dumb teenagers. Looking back, that might have made him very creepy.
Also, after reading the comments I have realized that I have Dawn handwriting. As much as I hated her, I think Mallory's writing was the easiest to read for me. Remember when she used to do the kitten/dog thing under her name?
omg- i hated that one too. It was only when I learned many years later that other people did most of the writing, not Ann M. Martin herself, that it made sense to me why I read some of the books 100000 times and others...once. #45 was definitely in the "once" category.
i was going to comment about the baby parades in new jersey, but i see jc has beaten me to it. but yeah, in some shore towns in jersey, they have baby parades in the summer. i've never been to one though.
and i totally had the bsc dolls! i had kristy and jessie and claudia. but they were kind of cheap, because claudia's boots broke. i wish i still had them, but i think they got sold at a yard sale.
this site is great! all i remember about the bsc books are the outfit descriptions and the fact that EVERY book had the entire history of the bsc taking up several pages. that always annoyed me.
My cousin turned me onto your awesome little traipse through BSC memory lane... nice work...
have you ever seen this:
Quite amusing.
(my apologies if you have linked to something like it in a previous post, I'm midway through 2006... Figured I should read things in order
Babies as Misty of Chincoteague? Whose stupid idea was that? I am looking at you, Mallory Pike.
AHAHAHAHAHA seriously...this book was stupid. Stacey must have blowing Charlie or something for him to do all the things that he did for the BSC...
oh, my god i totally forgot about the whole imitating their handwriting thing. i put hearts over the i's for like a whole year when i was 10. oddly enough, my writing is now very similar to mary annes...
Wire Coathangers. Hee!
Omg, I hated Mallory and her stupid little kitten face she always wrote under her name. That's because I spent the better part of my childhood thinking it was an 'i' and wondering "Why the hell is she signing her name Mallory I?"
Oh my God, I love this journal so much!!
Do you take requests? If so, could you please review #7, Claudia And Mean Janine? ANM's "Japanese" makes me seriously ragey. No Japanese person, especially a stroke victim who's lost a large amount of their language skills, would write a Japanese word in English letters. I also remember spending the first few years of high school Japanese being confused about why "white" was "shiro" or "shiroi" when ANM had said it was "shiroku". Now I know the stupid woman just lifted it from somewhere where it was being used in its adverbial form. Bleh. Plz to be doing your homework on foreign languages before you attempt to use them in your books, ANM, kthx.
Anyways, thanks for your hilarious reviews and keep it up!! :D
Allie, your link makes me die. XD
PS: So does the word verification thing, which appears to be "eilvncow". XD
oh im surprised you didnt comment on the cover: "Win a baby sitters club party with Ann Martin" im so curious about what exactly would happen at a baby sitters club party.
OMG, I hated this book! Baby parade? Gah. And Mrs. Prezzioso's obsession with it was annoying.
I too, imitated the BSC members handwriting. One of my BFF's from grade school and I used to pretend we were members of the BSC (she was usually MA, I was Dawn or Stacey) and we'd write about our sitting jobs in a notebook. But we'd also write entries for the other sitters as well. I think my handwriting mirrors Kristy's more than anyone else's.
I'd like to make a request as well, I'd LOVE to see a review of one of the California Diaries books!
baby kittens with tigger on the float?! how is that a bad idea? fo realz. baby kittens are the cutest animals ever.
and kristy was one of my least favorite babysitters.. i skipped a lot of hers.
I'm kinda glad I never read this one. I find the comment about Emily creepy too.
Request: Stacey vs. The BSC please!!!!!\
I'm reading this at work, and I can't stop giggling. Strangely I don't remember this one either, it must have really been that bad. Love the watermellon outfit, the sad thing is I am pretty sure I saw someone wearing something similar last week.
I always hated Kristy. Who wears turtle-necks THAT much?
Think god i'm not the only one!!!
I didn't try to start my own club, but I thought I needed to be the first one at my school to dress like Stacey. Not good.
I loved Stacey. Tried to write like her. Dress like her. I wanted to move to New York. I everything was either sophiscated or not.
I second the request for Stacey vs. the BSC
Sadly, at some point in my life, I tried to imitate Dawn's handwriting. I thought big, slanted, handwriting was so cool. Although I've pretty much given up on that, my handwriting looks most like Mallory's.
Didn't read this book, before, but it sounds like ANM is running out of plot ideas. Baby parade? Seriously?
mmmm - pretzels dipped in Nutella, one of my personal favorites. I don't remember this one specifically, but I do remember Claudia's watermelon outfit.
//Um, because cool and or genuinely famous people don't HOST FUCKING BABY PARADES IN SMALL TOWN CONNECTICUT!//
WORD.
Dude, your blog totally made me want to readthis one. I was kind of dreading it, and the firstten chapters were pure torture of "Ooooooohhh aren't babies CYOOOOOOT?!". But to my surprise, the parade chapters were HILarious. I mean, a senior in high school dragging around a horrible float for a BABY parade? And it totally cracked me up how Kristy was like, "Get me outta here!"
What's kind of weird is that in the book the float is described as unidentifiable and umpy, but in the cover in looks fairly good. But yeah . . . orange and pink?
These girls seriously wig me out about the way they totally get excited over BABIES. It's kind of creepy. And boring. And so is that description of Em.
Claudia spells simple words different kinds of wrong because it stifles her creativity to have to write them the same every time. Did you never read Stacey and the Mystery at the Mall?
I write my T's with a curly tail because of some damn diary entries.
And, uh, who really wants to party with ANM? I'm sure she's a lovely person, but hanging out with a middle-aged lesbian spinster? I think I'd rather go to a baby parade.
Rolling Stone Magazine, Issue 778, January 1998, Fiona Apple Cover (Paperback)
After Stacey's crush on Wes when she wrote what I thought was the best and most romantic poem in history, I started dotting my i's with hearts. I am now 23 and about to graduate from law school and I still do it! Granted when I'm taking notes w/speed, the <3 ends up looking like an infinity symbol, but I had to consciously try not to dot any i's on college applications with hearts, but I think I may have let one slip and that's why I didn't get into Columbia! Oh, and to whomever had the BSC Notebook, don't feel bad. I was also obsessed with Ghostwriter at the height of my BSC obsession and I kept a casebook complete with a pen necklace and kept notes with the gang. I also wrote Rally M on my hand even though I had no one to rally with and no fuzzy ball of light to read to my hand. Many things in my childhood were quite disillusioning...the maturity of 11-13-year olds and the ability of Middle Schoolers in Brooklyn to solve very dangerous mysteries.
Umm...the Old Woman who lived in a shoe whipped her children and sent them to bed. Great float idea.
Stacy was my favorite and I dotted my i's with hearts too for awhile and tried to copy her hamdwritting. I also had the Stacy doll and she came with a Charlotte doll.
I didn't have a BSC notebook but I wanted to be a writter and wrote my own stories and it was mostly just describing what a group of friends looked like and were wearing. Thanks AMM for the inspiration. BTW, why do you call her ANM, isn't it AMM? Is it just me who is confused by that?
Omg, Clare i totally copied Stacey's writing too!!! Then i gave it up... but i kept the i's and i still do them... in 8th grade... oh, the shame, the shame.
I WANT THE BSC DOLL DAMMIT!!!!!
Am I the only one who thought the star wars float was a very bad idea for babies? Dont you think giving a plastic sword to a baby can be dangerous? can poke someones eye out.
Also i think the girl scouts should have one
Dawn not the only one that should have appologized that big scene in Clauds back yard, Stacey was pretty bitchy too
who else wanted to just tell Jenny to shut the fuck up get over it your not in the parade!
who else was shocked the bsc didnt put on a parade for the older kids who might have been left out
also totally agree about kristy being the only one to think the baby needed a diaper when she started crying, um usually thats the first thing parents check when the baby starts crying even eating comes after that dumbasses! And I have low respect from the parents of that class who already have kids who didn't know that already stupid bitches.(provided by the Class of 2008 Fund)

But it's the execution, not the pedigree, that determines the real quality of a movie. And with actors firing on all cylinders plenty of drama and a surprising amount of humor, "Lincoln" most definitely delivers.
Ten minutes into Steven Spielberg's chronicle of the 16th president's efforts to pass the 13th amendment to the Constitution and bring an end to slavery, he and his star have already accomplished the rather daunting task of bringing the iconic Lincoln down to Earth while leaving his legendary aura intact. Whereas many actors' abilities can be appreciated even as they play a role based on their own projected persona, Day-Lewis ("There Will Be Blood") disappears into Lincoln, bringing him to familiar life without ever seeming like an animated history book page.
The same can't be said of Tommy Lee Jones ("Men in Black 3") as Congressman Thaddeus Stevens, an ardent abolitionist whose dedication to the cause at times endangers it. But this is a rough-around-the-edges, take-no-guff leader, so who better than Jones to take on the role?
For some reason, I was thinking of Sally Field ("The Amazing Spider-Man") as a bit of a lightweight when compared to the rest of the predominantly male cast, but she proved me wrong with her performance as Mary Todd Lincoln. Beset by miserable headaches and mental instability, the first lady serves as both a source of frustration and strength for her husband.
I wasn't expecting much comic relief in a historical film on such a serious subject, but it's there, often thanks to James Spader ("The Office") as a man of questionable reputation hired to help grease the wheels and get enough support from Democrats to get the amendment passed.
One of the central themes of the film is whether the end of thwarting slavery once and for all justify means like political horse trading, white-ish lies and half-truths and even delaying peace talks with the Confederacy. Lincoln himself is troubled by such questionable tactics, even as he decides to employ them.
The film doesn't attempt to make Lincoln out to be a saint. His critics are vocal, and their assertions don't seem at all implausible. What is perhaps most impressive is Lincoln's determination to plunge forward even amid the doubts with which he's so obviously dueling.
My only disappointment with the film came from the language. The official MPAA rating mentions only "brief strong language." That may apply to one word, but there are several terms tossed out with surprising frequency. I don't expect the film to be without profanity (nor do I believe the actual historical figures confined themselves to G-rated language) but it seemed a bit much at times.
Some of the political wrangling is a bit hard to follow, as is the identity of an occasional character or two, but that's more a product of the massive amount of moving pieces in the film than a real failing by Spielberg or screenwriter Tony Kushner ("Angels in America"). Many of the minor characters are given a lot more life and personality than you might expect, even for their brief appearances.
I hesitate to take any movie as a history lesson, but "Lincoln" certainly makes me want to read up on the president and this period in our history. You can't separate the movie from that context, but you don't have to be an expert on it to appreciate the fantastic film Spielberg and company have crafted.

Photo: Michael Bonocore
1. Paying a “model” to pose for you
If you’re in a well-touristed area, there may well be folks dressed up in traditional garb specifically to pose for tourists. If you’re a tourist, maybe that’s fine. If you’re a travel photographer (aspiring or otherwise), there’s debate over whether paying these traditionally clad locals “counts” as true travel photography.
The pros involved are obvious: They generally have very characterful faces (probably why/how they ended up pursuing this gig to start with), and they can be “posed” (to an extent) because you’re paying them — not to mention, of course, the traditional clothing usually involved. How “posed” is often dependent on how much money is involved. Snapping a quick shot of a Cuban in Havana with a big, phallic cigar is probably just a dollar or so; arranging a local to dress like a monk and wander through a temple at 5am is likely much, much more. As the posing becomes more demanding, the money involved will increase, and the ethics of the situation (or lack thereof) become more obvious.
The cons, as some see them, are that it’s not an “authentic” interaction, not an honest moment captured, and that it sets a precedent for future photographers coming through — it’s one more reason for locals in the area to demand money for images.
Plus, from a very practical perspective, since these folks make money from tourists, and tourists are usually around in the afternoon, you may be dealing with shadows from harsh afternoon light. If you do want to photograph someone in this way, aim for the late afternoon, or ask them to step into some shade.
That being said, it falls to you. If you’re not comfortable approaching someone on your own terms just yet, this can be a starting place. If you’re on assignment or you can just feel that a particular publication would love the shot, go with your intuition. Likely, if you’re gaining assignments or other experience, and can begin to see good opportunities as they arise (and tell them from bad ones), you can probably navigate the ethics yourself.
If you’re not experienced at this, be aware that it’s likely the picture will look posed, because, well, it is. Unless you’re fluent in the language, getting someone to act natural after agreeing to pay them can be nearly impossible.
Possible better options
- Research and book a cultural tour that will take you through some more traditional villages or neighbourhoods. Be sure the tour is respectful to those you are visiting; even better if the tours are actually a financial benefit to the community.
- Reach out to a local blogger or similar and see if you can help each other out. Perhaps they can act as your guide for a day, translate, and help you facilitate a few portraits. You could give them some of the pictures, or even pictures of themselves, in return.
- You could also reach out to something like Vayable – “boutique” tours by locals for more interesting and unique experiences that might get you the shot you’re looking for.
Say you really do want a Cuban with a huge cigar for your portfolio. Could you arrange a responsible tour of a cigar farm, and attempt to get friendly with the owners or some workers? Maybe you end up sitting with them for their lunch. Maybe you get invited to dinner. Maybe you end up sipping dark, sweet rum on someone’s front porch, and viola — cigars, golden light, Cuban men. Maybe it’s not always that easy, but often extra effort will beget a way better story, which makes that photo so much more meaningful.
2. Paying a local who requests money post-photo
This is different from “Pictures for Sale.” Usually this means you saw someone interesting, took a picture, and they noticed. They reach their hand out or approach you for money. Let’s assume this is not one of the people from option 1, but rather an older person with an amazing face, or someone in a market, or just someone sitting by the road. You now have three options:
- Say no
- Delete the photo
- Give them money or other compensation
With option 1, you do have the right to decline and apologize, but keep the photo. This is assuming the person felt like asking (perhaps s/he has seen others be paid, for example) but doesn’t seem too bothered by your declining. You could (and should) show them the image regardless.
But if the person is very demanding of money, and you don’t want to pay, you should consider option 2; delete the photo and show them you have done so. Perhaps you didn’t realize they were one of those traditionally dressed folks posing for money, or perhaps they are just tired of being photographed. Whatever the reason, unless the picture is absolutely incredible, it’s probably not worth the fight.
It should be noted that it would be unethical to “pretend” to delete the photo, but not do so. If you were knowingly trying to sneak a shot with a telephoto lens, and got caught, don’t get defensive or angry — apologize and deal with the situation calmly.
Option 3 poses the real ethical dilemma. Should you pay? Let’s say it was a candid, lovely photo, or perhaps one of dire circumstances that might really get some attention later on. We can’t answer this question for you. Assuming it wasn’t posed, and you really captured something great, it falls with you and your personal, gut intuition in the moment. This will vary from photographer to photographer, and there’s no one right answer for all situations.
“This beautiful Nicaraguan woman really stood out to me in the market because of her pink shirt and kind face. I took a few seconds to photograph her mangos (with her permission). I purchased a few mangos, and then asked her to hold one out for me. She laughed, but happily did it for me. Then I finally asked for a portrait. By this time she’d come around to me, laughing with her friends from nearby tables at the antics of the crazy photographer. This is a good example of purchasing items for the sake of the eventual portrait. Had she said no, the mangos were delicious anyway.Photo: Author
If the picture is of a child, and they ask for money, option 3 doesn’t apply. Never give children money, for a photo or any other reason. More on that below.
Possible better options
- If the person is working a market, a great ice breaker is to buy something. You can never have enough mangos.
- If they’re selling something you really don’t want, like say fresh chickens, ask to photograph the chickens — then see if you can photograph them as well.
- If they’re just sitting by the side of the street — a beggar, an elderly person, or simply someone taking a break from the sun — try to make a bit of small talk first.
- If you’re in no rush, offer to buy them a drink, a juice, a snack, or something else you could share. Perhaps it will lead to a conversation, and then who knows what else.
Be careful when taking pictures with a telephoto lens. It can make people feel very violated. If you are noticed, don’t shy away. Approach and show them the photos. Smile, laugh, and compliment them. Don’t be the creepy person lurking around with a massive telephoto lens. Capture the moment candidly, but be respectful and forward when you’re noticed.
3. Giving money to children
Children are beautiful. This is true everywhere. Often children will come running if you have a camera, and enjoy jumping in front of your lens for you. Aside from seeing if parents are present to approve of the images, there’s nothing inherently wrong about having a blast with a bunch of kids. But the bottom line here is never give money to children.
I was recently in Siem Reap, Cambodia. The place is dense with children begging, or selling photos or bracelets. We were photographing a temple, and I decided to sit down with a young girl who was begging. It was hot and I did want to photograph her, but I could tell she would ask for money. I don’t speak Khmer, so we just watched tourists together and giggled.
A well-dressed tourist spotted her and walked over with a friend. She handed her friend her camera and sat down on the other side of the girl, who wasn’t even looking. The woman leaned in and nudged the girl with her elbow; the young girl turned for the camera, indifferent at best. The woman reached into her purse and — after removing an enormous bag of lollipops — handed the girl a dollar. She walked away looking pretty thrilled with her photo, and probably genuinely felt like she just did a good thing.
But did she? I didn’t see a one dollar bill. I saw one more reason to beg again tomorrow. One more reason to stay on the street. One more reason not to go to school. And any nonprofit that is working with street or impoverished children will say the same thing.
To us, it can be just a few coins. But it perpetuates the poverty cycle of children, no matter how small it seems. Statistically, boys who stay on the streets too long end up involved in illegal activities; girls end up either pregnant very young, or even at higher risk for sex trafficking. No one wants to be unknowingly supporting any of those things. So when it comes to children, keep your money in your pocket, and support an organization working to get kids into school instead.
There are other common but less obvious issues when it comes to giving anything to a child. For example, candy. This is also a reason to stay on the street, a benefit, a perk, a treat. It’s also physically damaging, as many children dealing with poverty do not have a toothbrush.
On this same front, handing out toys is a bad idea unless you have enough for every child that comes running. You will likely just cause jealousy among the kids who missed out. Lastly, purchasing items from a child is still perpetuating the cycle, even if you get a legitimate item out of the deal — each sale is another reason to work the streets.
Cambodia is packed full of children who need help. It can take a toll on a traveler to deal with these beautiful children asking for a dollar all day long. To see their poverty is heartbreaking, and it can be incredibly hard to say no over and over again. Finding volunteer opportunities, like teaching photography at Anjali House in Siem Reap, is a far better solution than handing out money, candy, or toys, or purchasing items a child is selling.Photo: Author
Children will ask you for money. It’s important that we treat children (and people) everywhere the same. Would you hand money to a five-year-old in Sydney? No. Likely you’d ask them why they aren’t in school, or where their parents are. Would you purchase a bracelet from a nine-year-old hanging around the Grand Canyon? Probably not. Would you hand out candy in Central Park? If you did, you’d likely have a troop of parents (or cops) on you in a heartbeat.
Possible better options
- Invest time instead of money. Hang out with them. Jump into a game of soccer or jump rope. (That being said, always use common sense if in a neighbourhood known for pickpockets or bag snatchers.

- Research volunteering options in the area. And I really mean research — “day visits” to orphanages are often either damaging for the children emotionally (to have someone show up and then immediately leave again), or are total shams (children are lent or sold to the “orphanage,” and “tours” are set up with hotels in the area). Find an established nonprofit doing work you admire. And if you do volunteer, lend a good chunk of time and whatever skills you have, like teaching English, art, or even photography. If you plan it ahead of time, you can bring school supplies instead of toys and give them to the nonprofit to hand out fairly.
- Options for photography-based volunteer work can be found at The Giving Lens, PhotoPhilanthropy, or on gap-year websites — or even just reach out to NGOs yourself in the area where you’ll be.
Spending time with children while travelling is really special – just be sure you’re leaving behind the effects you were hoping to.

This article provides a rationale and stepwise process for evaluating and
improving the "greenness" of an undergraduate organic chemistry laboratory
curriculum. After emphasizing the educational value of sharing this process
with students, effective risk assessment is discussed as an important tool
for both evaluating and redesigning laboratory exercises. The greening
process is illustrated by describing modifications of three undergraduate
laboratory exercises (palladium-catalyzed coupling reactions, steroselective
reduction reactions and alkene epoxidations) through the use of safer
solvents and reagents. By asking each student to describe and evaluate the
greenness of a given laboratory exercise and to provide recommendations for
how the procedure could be made greener, we are helping our students
appreciate the important role of environmentally responsible laboratory
practices and thought processes in our society.

As per TSN, the Jets have also agreed to terms with former Lightning defenseman Randy Jones for one year, $1.15 million. Jones has also played for the Philadelphia Flyers and the Los Angeles Kings over a six-year NHL career.
Illegal Curve Analysis: Jones is a physical, defensive type who will solidify Winnipeg’s blueline with his leadership and experience. Jones is smart with the puck and has the ability to contribute offensively (Jones had 33 points for The Philadelphia Flyers in 2007’08).
The Jets also signed Defenseman Mark Flood to a two-way contract on Saturday (terms not disclosed). Flood played for the Manitoba Moose of the American Hockey League last season, registering 40 points.
Illegal Curve Analysis: Flood was Manitoba’s best defenseman last season and True North Sports & Entertainment (owners of The Moose and Jets) is very high on him. Flood will be invited to training camp in the fall but will most likely start the season in The American Hockey League and be a call-up for The Jets next season.

PHILADELPHIA (AP) — Just a few years ago, federal authorities thought they had the Philadelphia-area mob close to sleeping with the fishes: One boss had turned government informant, his successor was convicted of racketeering and the underworld organization seemed in disarray.
But a federal grand jury report unsealed Monday, announcing charges against the top two reputed Philadelphia mobsters and 11 others, paints a picture of La Casa Nostra as alive and well.
Its 70 pages detail an operation that has rebounded and is thriving in some of classic staples of organized crime: sports betting, electronic gambling, coded conversations and violent threats.
"Despite the clear history over the past 30 years, there are people still willing to be involved in this type of activity," said Barry Gross, a former assistant U.S. attorney who helped bring down several city crime bosses. "These allegations seem to be in line with what they've always done. ... It continues."
The old-school hallmarks of organized crime are detailed in a report that reads like something straight from the big screen, replete with real-life characters who go by "Uncle Joe," ''Mousie," ''Bent Finger Louie" and "Sheep."
The report outlines a structured world of bosses and underbosses, where members are "made" or "straightened out" in a ceremony where a knife and gun are displayed, and the potential member must agree to be willing to use either of them to help "our friends." The guiding rule of this underworld is "omerta," the code of silence, the grand jurors wrote, and the penalty for violating that code is death.
The indictment alleges that reputed mob leader Joseph "Uncle Joe" Ligambi, reputed underboss Joseph "Mousie" Massimino and 11 others engaged in loan sharking and ran illegal gambling businesses involving video poker machines and sports bookmaking.
There are no murder charges, but authorities allege the men used threats to kill or harm people to recoup business debts.
In April 2002, for example, two of the defendants went to collect "Uncle Joe's money" and one of them told the debtor that he was "capable of cracking" the victim if necessary, the grand jurors allege. In another instance a month later, two defendants allegedly told a victim they had repeatedly assaulted another debtor, once with a bat.
The indictment paints a picture of a classic world of coded talk, where illegal gambling machines — placed in coffee shops, restaurants and other places — are spoken of as espresso or coffee machines. Reputed mobsters and associates engage in and secret "walk and talks," the report alleges, having covert conversations on foot to hinder interception.
"Organized crime still exists in the Philadelphia area," George Venizelos, special agent in charge of the FBI's Philadelphia field division, said at a news conference announcing the charges. "It has not disappeared."
That's a different tune than authorities were singing several years back, especially after former mob boss Ralph Natale was sentenced in 2005 to 13 years in prison.
Natale is believed to be the first reigning mob boss ever to testify for federal authorities.
It 1999, Natale admitted he ordered or personally committed a total of eight murders in exchange for a shorter prison term. He later testified in four trials, including that of Joseph "Skinny Joey" Merlino, the man investigators say succeeded him as leader. Merlino and six others were convicted of racketeering and other mob-related activities but cleared on murder and attempted murder charges.
"He helped expose it and helped eradicate the La Cosa Nostra in the Philadelphia area," Gross said then.
In announcing the latest arrests, however, federal authorities described a revived and reinvigorated criminal enterprise that, Assistant Attorney General Lanny Breuer said, "has shown a remarkable ability to reorganize."
Edwin J. Jacobs Jr., an attorney who has represented Merlino and other alleged mobsters in the past, said prosecutors typically talk in cycles.
"At the conclusion of a racketeering case, the government will announce that they have delivered a fatal blow to organized crime," said Jacobs, who declined to address the latest charges specifically. "But when they indict the next case, they readily acknowledge a healthy and a vibrant and a powerful organization."
Gross said every past prosecution has hurt La Casa Nostra significantly, but the potential for making money keeps people coming back.
"It's about the money. It's always about the money," he said.
One notable absence from the indictment is actual violence, something noted by a federal magistrate at a detention hearing for Ligambi and another defendant.
A decade ago, the last big mob indictment alleged three slayings, part of a bloody period in which more than 30 people were killed in gangland violence — starting with the March 21, 1980, assassination of former crime boss Angelo Bruno.
The latest incarnation of the city's La Cosa Nostra, authorities allege, rules based on past reputation and fear.
"What they're banking on is fear," federal prosecutor John S. Han said. "They don't need to commit actual..

These practices are intended to help address issues posed by traditional construction and maintenance practices for buildings. According to the Department of Energy (Energy), in 2008, buildings in the United States consumed almost 40 percent of the nations energy and emitted about 39 percent of its carbon dioxide, a greenhouse gas recognized as a major contributor to climate change. Also, Energy reports that the approximately 30 million to 35 million tons of construction, renovation, and demolition waste produced annually in the nation account for about 24 percent of municipal solid waste, although most of this waste could be recycled. Furthermore, according to the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), exposure to indoor air pollutants, such as radon and formaldehyde, can lead to harmful health effects, from headaches to respiratory diseases.
In response to concerns about energy consumption, among other things, federal laws and executive orders have directed agencies to reduce energy consumption and meet other green building requirements in federally owned or leased buildings. For buildings not subject to these requirements because they are owned or leased by private, state, local, or tribal entities, laws have also directed federal agencies to foster green building. GAO refers to these entities and their buildings as the nonfederal sector, which accounts for most of the nations buildings.
As GAO reported in November 2011, there are 94 federal initiatives GAO identified to foster green building in the nonfederal sector. In conducting its work, GAO sent questionnaires to the 11 agencies implementing the initiatives identified. As the table below indicates, 3 of the 11 agenciesthe Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD), EPA, and Energyimplement about two-thirds of these initiatives.
Number of Initiatives That Foster Green Building in the Nonfederal Sector, by Federal Agency
Source: GAO analysis of agency information and questionnaire responses.
According to GAOs analysis of agency questionnaire responses, the 94 initiatives GAO identified share the broad goal of fostering green building. Specifically:
Federal Initiatives Fostering Green Building Elements in the Nonfederal Sector
Source: GAO analysis of questionnaire responses.
Note: Numbers total more than 94 because many initiatives foster more than one element.
In addition, GAO identified similarities among these federal initiatives that indicate potential overlap:
The 94 initiatives may vary greatly in the scale of their funding. GAO requested funding information for all initiatives, but the information agencies provided was incomplete and unreliable for the purposes of describing the size of green building initiatives. Agency officials stated that many of the initiatives are part of broader programs and, as such, the agencies do not track green building funds separately from other program activities, even for initiatives that have as a component the direct fostering of green building. As a result, GAO did not report funding information for the initiatives in its November 2011 report.
About one-third of the 94 initiatives GAO identified have goals and performance measures specific to green building and about two-thirds do not; therefore, the results of most initiatives and their related investments in green building are unknown. Agency officials reported various reasons for not having goals and measures, such as challenges in gathering reliable performance data. As GAO previously reported, leading organizations commonly define clear goals and related outcomes, measure performance to gauge progress, and use performance information to assess the results of their efforts and the related investment.[1] Achieving results for the nation increasingly requires that federal agencies work together to identify ways to deliver results more efficiently and in a way that is consistent with their multiple demands and limited resources.[2] Agencies and programs working collaboratively can often achieve more public value than when they work in isolation.
GAO identified some instances in which agencies have begun to collaborate to assess results. For example, under the Partnership for Sustainable Communities, the Department of Transportation, EPA, and HUD plan to adopt a common set of performance measures for HUDs Community Challenge Planning Grants Program, which makes funds available to state and local governments and other entities to promote affordable communities through green building, among other activities. Furthermore, Energy chairs the Interagency Energy Management Task Force, which includes 10 of the 11 agencies implementing the 94 initiatives GAO identified. Since 1988, this task force has served as the interagency group for collaborating on green building in the federal sector, measuring progress, and acting as a forum for addressing challenges to green building and developing common solutions for the federal sector. However, GAO did not identify a governmentwide effort to collaborate on green building issues, including shared goals and common performance measures, for the nonfederal sector that is comparable to the task forces efforts for the federal sector. Without such an effort, agencies with green building initiatives for the nonfederal sector may be missing opportunities to, among other things, identify the potential for inefficient or costly duplication, overlap, or fragmentation across these initiatives, and to reach agreement on governmentwide goals and measures for assessing the overall progress of their efforts to foster green building in the nonfederal sector.
[1]GAO, Executive Guide: Effectively Implementing the Government Performance and Results Act, GAO/GGD-96-118 (Washington, D.C.: June 1996).
Without comprehensive information about each individual initiatives progress toward fostering green building, and without collaboration across federal agencies to establish green building goals and ways to measure progress, Congress, agency heads, and the public have incomplete information about the results of individual and overall federal efforts to foster green building in the nonfederal sector and the efficiency of these efforts. Governmentwide collaboration to identify performance information could, among other things, help inform efforts to evaluate the potential for inefficient or costly duplication and overlap across the more than 90 federal initiativesimplemented by 11 agenciesto foster green building in the nonfederal sector. To help assess the results of investments in individual federal initiatives to foster green building in the nonfederal sector, as well as their combined results, GAO recommended in November 2011 that the Secretaries of Energy and HUD as well as the Administrator of EPA
Such an effort could help identify opportunities for enhancing efficiency and reducing costs to administer these initiatives.
The information contained in this analysis is based on the report listed in the related GAO product section. See pages 348-350 November 2011 report for review and comment to the U.S. Department of Agriculture, the Department of Defense, the Department of Education, Energy, the Department of Health and Human Services, HUD, the Department of Transportation as well as EPA, the Department of the Treasurys Internal Revenue Service, the National Institute of Standards and Technology, and the Small Business Administration. Energy, HUD, and EPA agreed with the recommendation. HUD, the U.S. Department of Agriculture, the Department of Defense, the Department of Education, the Department of Transportation, the Internal Revenue Service, and the Small Business Administration provided concurrence or technical comments which were incorporated as appropriate. The Department of Health and Human Services and the National Institute of Standards and Technology did not provide comments on this issue. As part of its routine audit work, GAO will track the extent to which progress has been made to address the identified actions and report to Congress.

Well, it hasn’t been quite that long, but the Robin Williams-in-drag film vehicle did come out during the “Jurassic” age, or more accurately, the exact year (21 ago) that “Jurassic Park” came out.
Which means Hollywood would have us believe: To Generation Y/Millennial or whatever, “Mrs. Doubtfire” is the Golden Age of Nostalgia Which Must Be Revisited.
I don’t know. Is it? I honestly don’t know how pervasive this comedy was to the young minds of today when they were merely twinkles in the eyes of Whitney Houston when she sang, “I believe the children are the future, they really love Mrs. Doubtfire,” those were the lyrics, right?
Anyway, the Hollywood Reporter broke the news today, attaching Williams with director Chris Columbus and writer David Berenbaum (he wrote “Elf”), with no word on whether the cast will include Sally Field and Pierce Brosnan.
To me, it’s even more interesting that Brosnan just said he can’t watch his 007 films, because he is so hard on himself, when to the rest of us, the problem with Brosnan’s 007 movies weren’t him but the scripts, directing and post, am I right? Because Brosnan is a badass Bond in the video games of the era, certainly in the “GoldenEye” game, which was so classic, many of us still re-live the N64 Brosnan “GoldenEye” action sequences in our mind’s eye while we’re nodding to sleep every night.

If you have food in your fridge, have clothing, have a permanent roof, you are richer than 75% of the worldwide population. If you have a little bit of money in a box, a bank account, you belong to the 8% richer people in the world. And if you read this, you have a computer…and probably own at least one motorcycle. Feel happy during your holidays.
Americans are spoiled brats. Happy holidays to Cyril and to all readers.
Cyril, thanks again for the reminder of how we as americans are so blessed and to keep things in perspective. Merry Christmas and a prosperous New Years!
Thank you Cyril for reminding us.
Happy Holidays Cyril
Merry Christmas, Cyril.
I thank my Lord every morning for what I have.
The fact we can react to this item says enough. Can you imagine us not having a computer and internet………
Merry Christmas and Happy New Year to Cyril and all of you there across the big ocean. May 2008 be a good one for you and your families.
Thank you Cyril. Merry Christmas to you, and to all the readers of your blog !.
Thank you for the reminder of our wealth. We sure are fortunate..
Merry X-mas and a happy new year!
Let me see, of the six people who own 59% of the wealth, only one could have a diploma and/or one a computer???? My question is where did you come up with these facts, they really do not compute. It did serve a purpose, to amuse. LOL
Yes, they compute because a lot of rich people overseas (and some here) inherited wealth without having a diploma or a computer. Go to travel in the Persian Gulf, Russia, some countries of South America for example.
Cyril is right. Most of the wealth in the world is inherited. Especially abroad. It doesn’t mean that the recipient has a diploma.
WE all must give thanks for what we have and quit crying for what we don’t have.Thank you Cyril for this Blog and God Bless everyone who and who doesn’t read this,,MERRY CHRISTMAS EVERYONE!!!On Fri, 25 May 2012 11:25:31 +0200, olivier Thereaux <olivier@thereaux.net> wrote: > On 15 May 2012, at 15:43, Audio Working Group Issue Tracker wrote: > >> Audio? > > This issue is now Pending Review, per > This is certainly an improvement! More feedback: The sampling of k-rate parameters is not defined, the sensible options would seem to be either the average value over one working buffer (128 samples) or picking the first, middle or last sample for that work buffer. In other words, if a signal oscillating between 0 and 1 at 20 KHz oscillator is used to control delayTime, will it be effectively a constant 0.5 second delay or a "random" delay for each work buffer depending on the phase of the signal?

If Kansas City is to host the 2016 Republican National Convention, it first will need the Republican Party to like it. In a Thursday media event, RNC Chairman Reince Priebus and site-selection committee Chairwoman Enid Mickelsen said they're impressed with Kansas City so far.
Here's what they had to say:
"It is a pleasure for me to be back in Kansas City. We were here a month ago for our technical team visit and saw so many things that impressed us that we wanted to bring the rest of the committee back and give them an opportunity to see all of the things that Kansas City has to offer. You have a beautiful city. There's a real sense of tradition and community spirit here we've been able to enjoy through your host committee. We've been so impressed — not only by the technical abilities of the people that we've talked with as far as the physical requirements that we have — but the people who were leading the fundraising effort. It's very clear to us that this is an all-in effort by your community, and that means a lot to us."
— Enid Mickelsen, site-selection committee chairwoman and Republican National Committeewoman for Utah, on the GOP's reception
"We had a great night last night, and we're having a good time as well this morning. There is leadership on both sides of the aisle here that are willing to come together and make sure that we put the best foot forward to make Kansas City work. (That) is something that I think is really special — especially the way politics work today. You've got a mayor here who's gone above and beyond the call of duty in throwing out the red carpet and the welcoming mat. This host committee ... having people with the vision and the heart, not just for the party but for the city of Kansas City, and the feeling that they have and the hunger to make this happen is special. You don't have to sell me on Kansas City. I'm a huge fan of Kansas City. For me, it's the West and the Midwest all bundled up into one nice gem, and I mean that. You've got a unique situation in two great states — Kansas and Missouri — coming together and doing everything they can to make it happen. People here in Kansas City are spending a lot of time and money in this review without a guarantee, and that's special, too. It's a big, big outlay of time and resources, and we're very thankful."
— RNC Chairman Reince Priebus, on the city and the bid task force
"I met with the vice president this morning, and he made it very clear to me that he's a big fan of Kansas City. That may have been the purpose of the meeting. At any rate, he's a good friend and a statesman and one of the elders of our party that run all over the place for us. He doesn't need anything or get anything, and he's just a benevolent man."
— Priebus, on former Vice President Dick Cheney's surprise visit
"I think we've all appreciated the sense of history (and) the focus on the 1976 (Republican National) Convention. There is a certain symmetry there that has not been lost on us. So, we appreciate the opportunity to hear some war stories from the former vice president (Wednesday) night about what really happened at that convention. It's a great opportunity to kind of see that commitment to family and tradition and to all of those Midwestern values that we've seen very prominently displayed on our visit."
— Mickelsen, on Cheney's visit.

Feature.Magne, first of all it is a question. Not request, not even a suggestion. (heh, nice rhyme) When I looked at this patch for the first time I wasn't aware of WL#4305. At that time your patch was the only viable fix. Now, I think we should consider WL#4305. The core problem you're fixing is performance bottleneck on mi_open(). Said the above, what I mean when I say "less intrusive": - keep list; - search hash only on open; - on open: add new hash entry; - on close: remove hash entry; - on panic: free hash; - probably failover to list if hash is broken; - probably consider hash broken if myisam is used not by the server. Mine arguments for less intrusive patch are: it should be safer, it should be easier to remove when we do WL#4305 based solution. Mine arguments against less intrusive patch are: current patch needs to be adjusted (probably 1-2 days of coding).

The index of coincident indicators, such as industrial output, retail sales and new job offers, gained 2.5 points on monthly basis to 114.8, against the 2010 base of 100, up for the seventh straight month, the Cabinet Office said in a preliminary report.
The figure was the highest level since February 2008, before the collapse of U.S. investment bank Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. in September that year that caused the global financial crisis and hurt Japan's economy.
Meanwhile, the index of leading indicators, which predicts developments three months ahead, increased 0.5 point to 112.2, up for the fifth consecutive month.
The index of lagging indicators, measuring economic performance in the recent past, gained for the third straight month, up 1.1 points to 115.6.
According to Japan's Kyodo News, the corporate sector was partly stimulated by the planned consumption hike in April, but there are some concerns that consumer spending and investment could face a downturn after the tax rate is actually raised next month.Please ask anything you need, I'm happy to help you!

"We had probably the best budget accommodation experience of our (extensive) traveling lives staying with Marton. It’s fact that he is an incredible host and lots of former guests would consider themselves friends. So many friends of ours have had an average time in Budapest largely because they were staying at large impersonal hostels and were charged over the odds for them. Thanks to Marton and Budapesting we had a fantastic time in that great city in 2006 so we decided to return again in 2008...”Rebecca & Malcolm - NZ
"He asked us beforehand for what kind of stuff we want to see and upon our arrival gave us a map where he showed places he thought would interest us, places we would definitely not have found otherwise. He taught us how to use the public transportation and then when we had no idea what to really do on new year's eve he invited us to a large party of a friend of his where we met a ton of very nice people."
Lars - Germany
"Ever since I found Marton's place through the internet I've wished all countries and cities I've traveled to would have a Marton of their own offering accommodation... Marton's Budapesting was a fantastic place to stay in Budapest for convenience, comfort and price. I would use it again and recommend it to all traveling to Budapest."
Gina - US
"These little apartments are run by a friendly family. They met with me at the apartment and provided me with maps and tons of useful info. They were accommodating, made sure everything was clean - and the apartment was in a great location! I pretty much walked everywhere while I was there. Loved having a little apartment to share with my own big room while I was in beautiful Budapest, definitely recommend."

DifficultyEdit
- It is hard to remove the icing, jelly, and liquorice locks in 15 moves, as every move counts.
- The jellies are worth 18,000 points (9 double jellies x 2,000 points per double jelly = 18,000 points)..: Hard
ReasonEdit
- The presence of five colours make.
-, 15 moves are insufficient to boost the score by a huge amount of points to meet those target scores.
NotesEdit
- Orange line(s) show where the candies spawn.
- Dark blue tile(s) indicate the position of double jellies.
TriviaEdit
- This level appears in PSY's "Gentleman" music video.

Now that sounds like a fabulous morning.
Hi Jenna.I got a new horse shortly after you got Merlin. We are both still in the "getting to know you" phase with our horses. For me, I feel that once I make it through the first "spook" or "freak out" by the horse then I know what to expect the next time around and gain loads of confidence. I did survive the sudden ambush by the compost bin when out riding the other day...!Lisa in MainePS-If you are concerned about no one knowing where you are should you be "parted" from Merlin, give someone (maybe Patty?) a call before you head out so someone knows your plans. I suspect that as you are riding on the land of a law enforcement official, he is likely keeping an eye on you and will come to find you if Merlin goes by without you! :)
Congrats! Well deserved reward.
Congratulations on a successful first solo outing. Now you know you can do it! You seem so calm in your writing, for finally reaching that dream.A couple of things I wondered about...wouldn't it be safer to face Merlin away from the road when mounting, in case he bolts? And does he wear shoes? I was curious about trotting him on pavement if he's barefoot. I don't know much about horse feet.Jasper is hilarious--Merlin suddenly makes him seem high-strung. I think watching their relationship evolve will be at least as interesting as your own with the new guy. So glad they get along, though!
So glad everything wen't well on your first ride at home with Merlin. You will gain conficence as time goes by. Wishing you many many more beautiful rides with your adorable Merlin.
Congratulations on your first solo ride. That's the only way I ride (husband cannot physically ride in a saddle, but in he does a great job training our harness race horses)and it is so nice having quiet, personal time with one of my horses. The one safety thing I do use (along with a helmet of course) is safety stirrups. I have a set of peacocks, but the rubber bands tend to dry out and break easily so I now use a set of bulky bright color plastic safety stirrups, cannot remember the name, but if I go off the stirrup center will snap off and go with me. Like you I do worry a bit, not about being tossed(I stay relaxed enough that I bounce pretty well for an old lady) but my fear is being dragged, so I try to cover my bases and then relax and have fun. Enjoy your boys.
So glad it was a great morning! Not much can be a trail ride on a good horse. May I offer a suggestion, and you can take it or leave it? If you are going to trot on your rides, it is best to do it away from home or at least heading away from home. Walking the last bit home is a general good rule to help keep Merlin from deciding to be barn-sour. (You don't want him trying to take the last bit of the ride faster than you like - so don't make the suggestion.) So glad he is home and you are soaking up the horseness. Enjoy!
We all know, the first time is always the hardest. It gets easier with practice. The more you ride, the more you'll bond, and the more enjoyable it becomes. I am a little jealous at this moment, but I have to wait on horses for a while. Guess I have to 'ride' via reading your posts! ;)
Brenda, I will look into those stirrups, they already saved me once!
Kristen, that is good advice. I don't want Merlin figuring out the faster he gets home the faster he gets to eat!
Ali, I face him in the direction I am going, but that is something to consider. He can only run about 10 yards before my road ends and a steep rock wall/stream starts so he'd have to run left or right!Merlin and Jasper are both unshod, he's never worn shoes. If I do a lot of road riding or driving he will need them but since he spends 99% of his time in pasture and paddock, or out in the woods his feet actually grow super fast and the farrier comes every 6-10 weeks depending on the season.
And lisa, I will let someone know, good advice!I like these questions!
There's a lovely old English saying: "Walk the first mile, trot the second, and do what the hell you like after that!" It's to do with loosening up muscles. I always used to walk the last half mile home too, so Fahly had a chance to cool down before I took his tack off and sponged off the sweat marks in summer.It sounds like you have a lovely area to ride in and I hope you have lots of fun. Those break-safe stirrups sound like a good idea. I used bent leg irons when I was riding, and they also release the foot.
That sounds like a perfect morning! I am glad it went will with Merlin!
The partnership will continue to grow. It is a definite challenge having no enclosed area or 'school' in which to ride and train. I kept a horse in a small city and rode through traffic daily to reach a wooded public park where I could school and ride and despite several mishaps and problems with spooking and headstrong behaviour, I was careful to not put myself in a position where I was likely to come unstuck.As for shod vs unshod a lot depends on the individual horse and the strength of its hooves.
The more you get to know him, the less nervous you'll be, and how far can you fall anyway? Fell ponies are known for their tough feet and soundness, after all the breed was created in the Scottish mountains. I doubt that the Vermont/NY mountains will be a problem.
Aaahhhhh.... your morning with Merlin sounded lovely. Thanks for sharing.I have a question you've probably already addressed, but either I've missed it or have forgotten. Why don't you ride Jasper? Is he a "cart only" horse?I loved the video of the two of them together. Will be interested to watch that relationship develop.Be well.
I completely know what you mean- it is all worth it when you get into that saddle. I ride Friday afternoons and after a long week in the office, riding is the best thing ever- although I am often tired and a bit cranky, that first mount into the saddle and the first steps of the horse put me into a different world- headaches and problems disappear and it is just you and the horse. The sun shines a bit brighter and I feel as though I can take on the world, me and my steed.
What do you ride, Elizabeth?!
A retired vet told me only the other day that when she was little her grandfather taught her to ride by putting her on a pony's back and, putting the reins in her hand, said to her "Fall off or sit up, the choice is yours." and sent her on her way.Jenna, you always seem to choose to "sit up" in your life. All the best with Merlin, and all the other new endeavours you're facing.
Hey Jenna! I ride a 19 yr old, 14 hand pinto gelding named Bandit. He is not mine unfortunately, I have been taking western pleasure lessons for the past year and LOVE it! I ride at a small stable in NH:. It is all just for fun but I think I have a new life long love. I can't wait to meet Merlin and Jasper at Antlerstock! I think we are about the skill level so I have laughed and sympathized with your riding posts (blog posts that is :)
Another thought: I always dismount in a different place so my horse doesn't rush up to where I saddled her. If she's been very good I'll get off in a good grazing spot and let her eat for a bit. Since I ride her in a bitless bridle this doesn't yuk up her bit. I have had at least one horse for the last 41 years and I only trail and none of them have ever had shoes. My husband's horse had a slight bout of laminitis some years back and while her hooves were growing out we put her in Cavallo Simple boots but since then she's been barefoot. At our ages we appreciate the smoothness of our mountain horses and it never ceases to amaze me what one little trail ride can do for my state of mind!
Sounds like pure heaven to me- so proud for you both!
When I read " I kiss his salt & pepper mane" a memory popped back in my head that I had forgotten years ago. Growing up we always had horses and I started off on a shetland pony, they have a reputation of beening mean and we had a love/hate relationship. Many wonderful rides we had together but on the other hand we had our problems. He was a biter and the memory that I had forgotten is one day when he bit me I turned around and bit him on his neck. I really thought that was going to hurt him but if a horse could laugh I am sure he would have. I continued to love that sweet/mean/biting/loving pony until he passed on to the other side.Through the years I had several horses that each had their on certain love and hate behavior. In later years of my life my two daughters grew up with their own horses also. There is no better relationship than when you reach the point that your trust in that certain horse can not be broken.

Already, users are reporting getting the Blue Screen of Death. As Forbes mentioned, the Blue Screen of Death (BSOD) has not been a frequent experience since Windows 98, but now iPhone 5S users are getting it. Many of them say that BSOD appears when they use one of the free Apple iWork apps that accompany the latest iOS devices, but others say it happens when they multitask between apps. When the BSOD appears, the device simply reboots. This problem has only been found in the iPhone 5S and not the 5C.
Those who use Apple forum report the issue can be corrected simply by disabling iCloud sync for Apple Numbers, Apple Keynote, and Apple Pages. To do this, users must go to Settings, select iCloud, locate “Document & Data” for each of the apps mentioned and set it to off.
There is a new iOS 7 update from Apple, called iOS 7.0.2. It is supposed to correct a problem that makes the lockscreen easy to get past, but does not address the problem with the BSOD appearing, nor the iMessage issue. Apple has announced plans to release yet another update to repair the problems with iMessage, but this new update might mean that an additional update needs to be in the works.

Ben's Week In Review: January 15
I keep forgetting that it's 2012. I have to stop writing 2011 on everything.
Genre blending: a good thing or not?
Those comments by Hitman: Absolution developer IO Interactive concerning the changing stealth genre really got me thinking. I distinctly recall a time when most games could easily fall into one category. It would take all of five seconds to categorize most any given title. But as technology has advanced, designers have been able to implement a variety of gameplay mechanics, meaning the lines between genres are getting blurrier by the second. It's just that so many gamers remember a time when, for example, stealth was stealth. You couldn't play Metal Gear Solid with a run 'n gun attitude. It's just not possible (at least, not really).
And so, when we see all this action-oriented gameplay in titles like Absolution, fans of the genre get all bent out of shape. They're not realizing that the action should be - according to the devs - entirely optional. It's just an expansion; i.e., more choice for the player. But do you think this is a good thing? Or would you rather have more defined genres as we used to have? It was a little more straightforward, after all...
It's true that all major regions are different, but...
I'm not sure I like Sony's statement about how you can't predict anything based on the Japanese launch of the PlayStation Vita. I mean, first of all, Japan really seems to love their portable electronic devices, so if a handheld doesn't fare well there, I'm not sure it'll explode elsewhere. Secondly, while I certainly understand the inherent demographic and cultural differences, you can't tell me there's nothing to be learned from the Vita launch in Japan. We shouldn't be passing judgment or making far-reaching predictions just yet, but in many respects, gamers are gamers. A gamer who likes handheld entertainment in Japan can't be that much different than a fan of handheld entertainment elswhere...can he?
Me, I don't want to complicate the issue. I just think that despite all the considerations and factors, it really comes down to price and available games. It seems the Vita has the games, but the price may be somewhat restrictive. There's also the question of mobile gaming (tablets, phones) versus dedicated handheld gaming devices, but let's face it: if the Vita was a hundred bucks, it'd sell like mad, right?
Personal gaming update
I'm at the end of Gears of War 3 (I think) and I guess I'll have to be on the lookout for Final Fantasy XIII-2 in the next few weeks. I liked a few things about the playable demo, like the fact that the game isn't automatically over if the leader dies, but I have plenty of reservations. I'm just not that excited about it. However, although it's too heavy on the QTEs, that Asura's Wrath demo was pretty wacky. Games that are so unabashedly over-the-top are really quite entertaining in a lot of ways; sorta refreshing in a way, too. One always thought all video games would head in this direction back in the '80s; every single game had an over-the-top theme then.
Not much else to report, although I should add that after 7 years with my old cell phone, I finally caved and got a new one. They were offering the Samsung Stratosphere 4GLTE for free with a two-year contract (and there was an upgrade available on our family plan). So whatever; $30/month for 4G worth of data, which I'll never use up, and $10/month for the insurance. I can live with that. But don't ask if I'm sitting in the living room playing games on it. If I'm playing games in the house, it's on the freakin' TV. ;)

Tablets are another thing though but I'd rather have a laptop. New slim and slick asus laptops are pretty neat and pretty much the same price an Ipad 2 64gb is... But you get to do much more. Tablets are for PC newbs who don't want to bother learning how to use one. Pretty much sums it up... Ain't really a bad thing but I don't think your mom will ever play real games on a tablet. She doesn't care. Much like 80% of the tablet users. They use it to check mails... Read the online news... And show pictures to their family.
Leave gaming to the real deal: Gaming handhelds.
PS: I am part of the market and I'll never buy a phone or tablet for games. And the phone and market you are talking about mostly do not give a crap about games. They buy it for it's main fonction: phone. Or for the tablet: Pc extension. I am sure most gamers feel the same way. It's the same as what happened with the Wii. Casuals are getting into it and falsify the numbers. Lots of Wiis out there but I bet there is much less *real* gamers on em than on PS3 or Xbox. Mostly casuals who want to exercise XD. Just like phones... Mostly casuals who *angry bird* their free time. (Gotta say though these days I see alot of fruit ninja in the subway too. lol)

As for the Vita. I'm not to worried. I think it will pick up in Japan once it gets some jrpgs on it. I know I will be getting it day 1 or shortly after. I got a nice surprise in my mail today. I had an escrow surplus so I may just go preorder it this week
PGU: I finished Ace Combat this week and now I'm on stage six of Catherine and it just got a lot harder. I'm loving the game though. The controls are little touchy sometimes though. After that I think ill dig into Alice: Madness Returns or go back to Mortal Kombat and finish that.

Theres probably some YouTube videos out there or try googling a quick fix.
Edit: I googled PS3 laser repair and a good step by step video came up. I watched It and it is fairly easy, and only take about 10 min. Also found some other websites and forums saying they fixed it without getting a new laser but I didn't look into those, because I don't know how reliable that is or would be.

It does sound like a potential laser problem BUT I ran into the exact same problem on one 60gb PS3's...I bought GE lens cleaning disc at by local video store and used it. IT WORKED!!! So there is some hope.
Now I did have a Blu ray laser failure on another 60gb machine and nothing could help it.
The blu ray laser failure happened to my Sony refurb unit they sent back to me approx 7 months after I sent my first 60bg off for repairs. I did not even get a year out of the Sony refurb!!! :(

As long as devs do what Hitman is apparently doing and keeps the original gameplay at the center, I don't mind genres bending a bit. More options are rarely a bad thing.
As for the Vita, I'm also not buying Sony's claim that you can't tell anything from the lackluster Japanese launch. As Ben pointed out, the Japanese market is much more enthusiastic about portable consoles than the US market is. And if that market wasn't able to support the Vita as much as expected, I doubt other markets will be able to.
PGU: I got distracted from MGS3 and am currently playing RDR. I've been on a western kick lately, watching Tombstone, True Grit, and Lonesome Dove in the past week and this game has fit in wonderfully. Can't believe I waited so long to play this one.

Besides that, most genre-benders I've played have this dichotomy between both of their genres and the gameplay feels thrown together, neither side really fitting the other. They also add nothing new to gaming since they're combining two existing ideas.
It's when they incorporate elements from other genres but know what they are and accomplish what they want - that's impressive. Sly 2 is a great example of that. Full of well-executed ideas as well as originality and creativity all over the place.

Speaking of genre blending, Metal Gear Solid, and running and gunning...
I'm playing Peace Walker now for the first time, and I'm enjoying it so far, especially the team and weapon-developing elements. They remind me a bit of RTSs in a way. But did anyone else notice that the game seems pretty... well, easy? At least compared to the main series? I bring this up because I was trying to show a friend the comic book style cut scenes by breezing through a level. Whenever I did that in any of the other games, I always got spotted, and in this one, I never raised the alert level once. Granted I'm still within the first three hours, so I imagine it will be getting harder, but in MGS3, (which I just finished for the 3rd time,) there is no way I could have gotten away with it, even so early. I'm still enjoying it, but it doesn't feel all that important to really be sneaky...

The Vita had a good launch and sold 320,000 consoles in 2 days. There was every reason to believe that the Vita was going to sell 200,000 consoles in its second full week(analysts were predicting that). Then, something happened. It only sells 72k in its second week, and then follows that up with 43k in its third week. That is a huge drop off. Way worse than the drop off the 3DS went through, and that drop off had Nintendo scrambling to right the ship.
I have wondered about the Vita's launch line up of games. Does it really have a true system seller for Japan? It has a large and diverse line up, but I'm not sure how strong it is. Hot Shots Golf was the Vita's best seller by far...that's going up against Monster Hunter on the 3DS. Not exactly a fair fight.
There has to be an explanation for the drop off in sales. It's either the Vita's price point, or its games.

I have said this before but I have experienced a severe case of deja vu when reading Vita headlines. Late out of the gate vs a major competitor. Check. Huge decline in sales after intitial launch. Check. Negative headlines surrounding the product and rumblings that a price cut may be necessary. Doublecheck. This feels strangely familar somehow. I know it's still early but like World said above me in this thread... if you can't sell a handheld to the Japanese you are in big trouble.

Look at Heavy Rain, the first in "Interactive Drama".
As for too much option, yes it's possible. I wholeheartedly believe that NEW ip's should blend genres and make their own identity from what they think works. However, well established franchises need to stick to the genre they are in. I say this because of the criticism FFXIII received (and 10 points lower on metacritic than FF's should be getting), Front Mission:Evolved, Resident Evil 5, and more.
Well established franchises try to branch out, and wha'd'ya know... it gets heckled and isn't the same success it's predecessors were.
People WANT that consistency. But they want new as well. Which is why new ip's that create new genres, like Heavy Rain, and games that blend genres, like Mass Effect, should be the ones to do so. They are the successful ones because they've created their own identity. Old franchises that suffer an identity crisis.... do not.
I believe gaming should be diverse enough that there are LOTS of genres and LOTS of games everywhere between those genres. Then everyone benefits, and the industry will grow in both relevance and creativity.

"RE5 is great example of a game straying too far from gamer's expectations in an attempt to blend genres"
Same could be said for FF13 as well. Thing is both were great games. Well I havnt played FF13, but I've heard enough about it. But they just wernt good sequels in the franchise.
There's been a lot of that this gen. Socom has gone completely away from the stealth focused mp to try and be more like an FPS. That's my biggest let down this generation. At this point I just want Socom 2 HD.

There you chose your playstyle as you go, with the skills you invest in. Like me who invested in sneaking abilities (and thus opted to NOT become a shooter specialist), there was no way whatsoever I could survive a gun fight. To me, Deus Ex became a 100% stealth game. A buddy of mine chose the 100% confrontal route (health/dodge/gun skills etc), so to him this became a shooter.
That's how they should do it I think, that's player freedom without being too generic. You shape your own game the way you want it to be - with the restrictions that follows with such a choice.

Many may disagree but I believe that Splinter Cell Conviction actually did this fairly well, or at least made the first step in a good direction. Keep the hunter game mode in mind while reading this because that's what I have in mind. When played on easy the game is too easy and run-and-gun works very well, also the mark and execute function really takes away a lot of fun. Now if you play the game on realistic with gadgets turned off (and maybe pistols only turned on) you'll find that running and gunning becomes much harder. Also the lack of the goggles, which were overpowered IMO makes for a challenge. You really have to watch the proximity of enemies you kill because they will hear silenced shots and takedowns. I really like playing this game mode and I find it a great blend of action and stealth. If anyone wants to play it add me on xbox live I'm DJ Downy.
I think the days of purely stealth games like the original splinter cell games are over, the majority of people just don't have the patience for it anymore. Even myself, I find that I like a little bit of action thrown in with my stealth, I just hope it doesn't go too far. I think the perfect mixture is that stealth is the more fun, strategic way to play and having to run and gun should be a sort of punishment that is a pain in the ass that you try to avoid by being stealthy but it should not just be "game over" if you get spotted.
I'm really excited for Absolution, been a fan since Contracts and I loved Blood Money. The Hitman series is in my top 10 favorites.
Ben,
Glad to hear you've joined "the smart phone revolution". I bet it wont be long before you find yourself playing jet pack joyride or something similar at home. I've heard there are some great RPGs for the mobile devices, I'm not a fan of the genre but you clearly are. The thing with playing these games at home is that you find yourself on a commercial break and you start playing and end up missing your show because you get so into it. Give it a chance it might take you by surprise. I hope to hear in a future week in review if you find anything you like.

Was in Italy for a little while where the internet is scarce. For some reason this site was blocked the whole time. Thought that was rude. It was nice to catch up on some good articles. I enjoyed reading the end of the awards. Now I'm in the Czech and shortly on my back to Italy. Hopefully there will be internet but I'm not going to hold my breath. Made a little money this week. Might look into a new gaming quality lab top, but if the remote play features on the Vita are as good as they sound I might just go for that instead and get a cheap minimal computer when I need one.
Been play some old school Quake. I really like the style of having to side strafe and back track to stay alive. It's a fresh change from the duck and cover of this gen.
Once I'm done with my book I'll get back into FFIX on my PSP.
I think genre blending is a double edged sword. Hopefully not every developer abandons there game roots.
And I so sorely want the Vita to do well. I think the vita is a good example of the benefits of not genre blending. It specializes in hand held gaming. Not thousands of apps, phone calls, and half baked games like the smart phones.

It kills the fun of playing a game in a genre if it is too flexible, unless it's something like Skyrim. Genre blending has killed so many franchises this gen.
I'm still gonna get FFXIII-2, it may not be what I want but it resembles a JRPG and it should be pretty good. I just hope my CC company hurries up with that Amazon gift card I exchanged my points for.
No offense to Vita fans but I think dedicated handhelds are just about finished now that everyone has their tablets and smart phones. I hate touchscreen tech for games but I guess the current market doesn't.One approach to increasing the supply of health services is rational delegation of some of the physician's traditional functions in delivery of health care. Such an approach involves reallocating duties between the physician and other health personnel to achieve the best use of skills at each level, and often results in reducing the time input in education required to perform a given health service. This reallocation of duties can take place in two ways: by expanding the medical service role of existing health occupations, or by creating and recruiting for new career roles to assist the physician.
Neither of these methods is in itself new. Physicians have been delegating tasks to allied workers and training their own "assistants" for many years. Many physicians, within their office settings, have been highly successful in training persons to perform specific functions previously associated solely with the physician's role.

Mazur went 10-for-14 from the floor, including 8-for-11 from 3-point range on his way to a career afternoon. Mazur topped his previous career high of 29 points, which he set earlier this season at Carroll University.
Chris Siebert added 25 points for the Vikings (11-10, 9-7 MWC), and Ryan DePouw added 15 points on the strength of an 11-for-11 day at the foul line.
Joey Guth scored 22 points and Nick Bobb added 21 points and a game-high nine rebounds for Cornell (8-13, 7-9).
Lawrence led by as many as nine points in the first half before Cornell rallied. The Rams led by as many as four points before the eighth tie of the first half ended with a 49-49 deadlock at the break.
Conor Klusendorf’s layup with 11:33 left gave Lawrence the lead for good at 67-66, and the Vikings were holding an 81-79 lead with 3:28 left. Siebert and Mazur then hit back-to-back jumpers for the Vikings, and Lawrence pushed the lead to 85-79.
Cornell was forced to foul in the final two minutes, and the Vikings went 10-for-10 from the stripe down the stretch. Lawrence finished the day 25-for-27 from the foul line.

CloudInsure Selects Oceanwide(R) BRIDGE for Policy Administration and Consumer Portal Functionality
(Marketwire Via Acquire Media NewsEdge) NEW YORK, NY and MONTREAL, QC -- (Marketwired) -- 06/09/14 -- Oceanwide, Inc. (Oceanwide), the leading provider of completely configurable, SaaS insurance software announced today that CloudInsure, the world's first cloud insurance platform designed to specifically address emerging privacy and security liabilities within the cloud environment, has selected Oceanwide BRIDGE for policy administration and consumer portal functionality.
CloudInsure selected BRIDGE to enable the deployment of a direct-to-consumer portal for the company's cyber liability platform, and to handle critical policy administration processes, including rating, document generation, and product design.
"Our expertise in cloud and cyber risk makes us a stringent evaluator of cloud offerings," said Fred Bartkiewicz, managing partner and co-founder of CyberRiskPartners, the parent company of CloudInsure. "Oceanwide impressed us with the high level of maturity and sophistication we saw in their SaaS operations. That was very attractive for us." "There were several other factors that led to our decision to partner with Oceanwide," said David Kimmel, CEO of CyberRiskPartners. "BRIDGE allows for impressive flexibility while maintaining an easily configurable rating engine, and the user interface for the client portal is modern and clean. Oceanwide has been a great partner to us, and has shown a true dedication to our success, not just making a sale."

On July 15, leading event security company, The Protective Group, comments on an article published on Security Info Watch about the upcoming SECONEXPO in South Korea and what it means for security companies.
According to a June 24th article published on Security Info Watch titled, “SECONEXPO 2014,” South Korea’s largest and Asia’s most famous security exhibition, SECONEXPO, will be held from March 12th-14th. The event has been held annually over the past 13 years and has attracted hundreds of thousands of visitors.
John Monderine, CEO of event security company The Protective Group, says this is one of the biggest security technology trade shows in the world. “When you’re in the business of security, you have to be constantly looking at what’s new and what can help your business do better work,” he says.
The article says the SECONEXPO offers the opportunity to witness the latest and greatest advancements being made in security with “400 exhibitors, 800 booths and 40,000 visitors” expected over the two-day event. Some of the technologies that will be showcased on the trade room floor include “CCTV, access control, biometrics, IP surveillance, perimeter security, alarms and detectors, and convergence and integration.” The article says other emerging corporate security innovations will also be shown.
South Korea has, in the past, been known to produce some of the best technological devices used by modern day security companies. The purpose of the event is to showcase the new technology and allow security businesses to “gauge the market sentiment,” according to the article.
Monderine says events like these are extremely important to the security business. “No matter what sort of security you are involved in, having access to the latest and greatest technology available will always give you an advantage,” he explains. “Expos like SECON are important for making sure security companies are made aware of where the industry is going. The business is always changing and advancing, so you have to be on top of all of these new changes.” exclusive events or places of business.

The 10-meter South Pole Telescope's millimeter-wave camera captures images of the CMB, radiation left over from 270,000 years after the Big Bang. Galaxy clusters affect the brightness of the CMB after it has passed through them; this brightness change is the SZ effect, and is independent of distance to the galaxy cluster, unlike the optical or x-ray brightness of the clusters.
These galaxies, Staniszewski says, are likely billions of light years away and around seven billion years old.
After analyzing a year's worth of data, the SPT team is confident in their discovery. Part of the data set was taken by Staniszewski during his winter stay at the South Pole manning the telescope. Bolstering the confidence that the newly discovered clusters are real, the paper includes analysis of data from follow-up optical observations with the Blanco Cosmology Survey (BCS) instrument, led by University of Illinois astrophysicist and SPT collaborator Joe Mohr.
"The theory of how galaxy clusters imprint a signal on the CMB has been around for nearly 40 years, when two Russian physicists first proposed it in 1969," said Staniszewski. "The SZ effect has been seen in clusters that were already identified by optical and x-ray observations, but no one had yet used it to discover a brand new galaxy cluster. These are the first galaxy clusters discovered using this method."
The SPT will produce a larger catalog of new clusters with more data and analysis. "These three new clusters are just the tip of the iceberg," notes Ruhl. "The full survey is what will help us achieve our ultimate goal, which is to understand dark energy."
"The expansion of the universe is accelerating, and because of that we believe that dark energy dominates the energy density of the universe. Dark energy provides a negative pressure, or repulsive force, that accelerates the expansion, rather than slowing it down like the attractive force of gravity does," said Staniszewski. "We're trying to figure out what dark energy actually is, and it turns out that a survey of galaxy clusters can be used to trace the expansion history of the universe, which can tell you about the dark energy."
Gravity works to pull pockets of galaxies together, into clusters, a process that is more effective at early times when matter is dense. Dark energy speeds up the expansion of the universe and spreads out the matter, which slows down clustering. Counting the number of galaxy clusters as a function of time throughout the history of the universe can therefore be used to understand dark energy.
The South Pole Telescope project is funded by the National Science Foundation. The project PI is Professor John Carlstrom at the University of Chicago, and the science team is comprised of over 40 scientists from Case Western Reserve, University of Chicago, University of California at Berkeley, Cardiff University, University of Colorado, Harvard Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics, University of Illinois, Lawrence Berkeley Laboratory, McGill University, and NASA Marshall Spaceflight Center.

Hi everyone,
I am using PCI-6229 and trying to develop a code that can generate a TTL/square function signal as soon as one analog input satisfies following conditions: 1. Crossing a certain value (say, 0 V); 2. Falling edge slope. The time delay between the crossing point and newly generated TTL/square signal will be critical in my measurement, and it should not exceed 1 millisecond. Any suggestion on it? Thank you in advance!

Save your lipstick girls, he plays for keeps.
In 1946, Director Henry Hathaway took a chance on young Hollywood starlet Lucille Ball (yes, that Lucille Ball) in this tiny noir about a deadpan detective whose sordid past is about to catch up with him.
Brad Galt (Mark Stevens) is a laid-back private eye with the hots for his sassy secretary, Kathleen Conley (Lucille Ball, I Love Lucy). While on his first date with Kathleen, Brad notices a large man in a white suit shadowing them. After confronting White Suit -- and roughing him up a bit -- Brad learns that it was his pretty boy ex-business partner, Tony Jardine (Kurt Kreuger), hired him to follow Brad. After confronting Jardine -- and roughing him up a bit -- Brad begins to suspect that the fat man in the white suit lied to him. But why?
While Brad investigates this strange series of events, dead bodies start piling up. The police think he's involved and soon Brad's picture is decorating the front page of every paper in the city. With nowhere to hide, and the law on his tail, Brad turns to the only person who believes in his innocence -- his secretary, Kathleen.
While watching The Dark Corner I was reminded of a venue for obscure movies that is about to close. Last year I purchased a TiVo and since then I pretty much only watch television that I have pre-recorded. It used to be, if I couldn't sleep I would be up at two in the morning flipping through the channels looking for a movie to watch. The far majority of films were insipid trash like Anaconda or Collision Course. But then there were the rare occasions when I would come across something I had never seen before; something I might never have seen if I hadn't been up at 2 a.m.; something that was actually good. Money that you find lying between cracks in the sidewalk is found money. I always considered these to be found movies. Some of my all-time favorite films have been found movies: Zazie Dans Le Metro (why isn't this on DVD yet?), Butterflies Are Free, and The Cook, The Thief, His Wife, & Her Lover. Sure, I'm not very productive at work the following day, but movies like these make it worth staying up.
Now that I have TiVo there's always a hoard of recorded shows (those Daily Shows and Colbert Reports pile up pretty fast) on call to entertain me until it's time for the morning shower. I no longer have to look to Turner Classic Movies or the Independent Film Channel or HBO-7 in desperation. In fact, I don't even get desperate anymore. In many ways that is a good thing. But it is with a bit of melancholy that I recognize, while TiVo has improved my life in so many ways, it has brought about the end of found movies, at least for me.
I was reminded of this while watching The Dark Corner, because The Dark Corner is a film I had never heard of; it is a film I never would have seen if I wasn't reviewing it; and it is a movie I would have been happy to stay up until 4 a.m. to watch.
Probably the most notable aspect of The Dark Corner is that it features Lucille Ball in a straight role. Years before she became America's favorite ditzy redhead, she had achieved modest success playing a series of sassy-talking romantic leads. In fact, The Dark Corner was the 62nd film she appeared in. It is interesting to note that she did not like The Dark Corner. In particular she hated her part and her performance. She only took the role because she was in the midst of suing MGM Studios to get out of her contract and The Dark Corner (which had a B-movie budget) was the only work she could get.
It is difficult to understand Ball's disdain. Her performance is funny and airy, without any hints of the ditziness that would later launch her into superstardom. In fact, she even radiates a sultriness that would be almost entirely absent from her Lucy Carmichael character. The cast of The Dark Corner may be full of second-tier noir actors like Mark Stevens as the detective and William Bendix as the heavy, but they all turn in capable performances.
Another of The Dark Corner's assets is its datedness. While this might be distracting for some, I found it endearing. In the first scene, Brad begins openly flirting with his secretary. When 6 p.m. approaches and Kathleen asks to go home for the day, Brad refuses and orders her to go out with him that evening instead. In 2006 America, this would be clear grounds for a lawsuit. Audiences would bristle with anger and discomfort. But in 1946, it's just romantic banter. Later, while the two dally around the local penny arcade, Brad uses a suggestive double entendre involving baseball to propose they go back to his apartment. Kathleen responds unaffectedly, "I know when you're throwing a curve at me, and I always carry a catcher's mitt."
In addition to the rapid-fire dialogue, The Dark Corner has many of the ingredients that signify a classic film noir: dark lighting, smoky sets, a stoic detective and mysterious forces out to get him. The film follows the formula with such exactitude and competence that it seems to effortlessly entertain. However, The Dark Corner is a small film, with a small budget. Its story is conventional, straightforward, and lacks any great surprises or ambition. This is no so much to the film's detriment; it merely prevents the film from becoming great, or transcending its genre.
20th Century Fox has released The Dark Corner as another title in its Fox Film Noir collection. I cannot comment on the video or audio quality of other films in the collection, but The Dark Corner's is merely adequate. There are no problems with the audio; the movie has few sound effects to test the DVD's Dolby Digital soundtrack. But the video quality could certainly have been improved. Director Henry Hathaway shot the film with a lot of shadow, and in a few scenes those shadows darken the entire picture. Still, the video quality is nowhere near poor enough to affect one's enjoyment of the movie.
There are few extras on the DVD, but Fox has provided an educational commentary by film historians Alain Silver and James Ursini. If you don't know much about classic film noir, but would like to learn, this commentary would make an excellent primer for the genre.
If you keep your expectations modest, and you're up late with nothing else to watch, The Dark Corner should entertain you just fine.
Mr. Galt ought to thank the stars he's got such an easygoing secretary. Not guilty.

Tot Died after Dad Left Him Inside Car; Dad in Hot Car Death Was Sexting
Aired July 3, 2014 - 20:00 ET
THIS IS A RUSH TRANSCRIPT. THIS COPY MAY NOT BE IN ITS FINAL FORM AND MAY BE UPDATED.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) UNIDENTIFIED MALE: The child appeared wide awake and happy. UNIDENTIFIED MALE: What he was doing that day while the child was out in the car... UNIDENTIFIED MALE: He was having up to six different conversations with different women. UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Sexting. UNIDENTIFIED MALE: No tears, no you know, real emotion coming (INAUDIBLE) UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Photos being sent back and forth between these women and the defendant during this day, while the child`s out in the car. UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Yes. There were photos of his exposed penis, erect penis being sent. UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Now, the 16-year-old girl,. UNIDENTIFIED MALE: He also did a search, "how to survive prison." UNIDENTIFIED MALE: (INAUDIBLE) it was called "child free." And "child free" is a -- people who advocate living child-free. UNIDENTIFIED MALE: He wanted to live a child-free life, or there`s evidence to suggest that. (END VIDEO CLIP) NANCY GRACE, HOST: Good evening. I`m Nancy Grace. I want to thank you for being with us. Bombshell tonight. We are live at the courthouse at a dramatic courtroom showdown, where horrific details of the tragic death of 22-month-old toddler boy, Cooper, seemingly left alone for hours in a baking hot car by Daddy. But tonight, was the tot actually murdered? In the last hours, stunning and damning new details emerge. Daddy, in a court of law, there, listening, sitting stoically until evidence comes out he`s sexting six different women -- sexting, sending pictures to women of his erect penis as his toddler boy, Cooper, bakes dead in the car at the same time, evidence indicating the baby scratching his own little face, crying out loud, abrasions on the back of the child`s head as he likely rocks, banging back and forth, calling out for Daddy. We are taking your calls. Straight to the courthouse. Haisten Willis, "Marietta Daily Journal" -- Haisten, bombshells in court. And I was watching him like a hawk, Haisten. And he sat there stoically, no movement, nothing, until it came out he was sexting six different women after he leaves his child in the car. That`s the first time he snapped up and started talking to his lawyer, and the lawyer, Maddox Kilgore, jumps up and objects. That`s the first time he showed emotion, Haisten. HAISTEN WILLIS, "MARIETTA DAILY JOURNAL": I picked up on that, as well. He didn`t seem to be bothered by some of revelations about the child, some of that type of thing. But when it came to things that were about his own life, that`s when he seemed to be bothered the most. GRACE: OK, let`s go in the courtroom. Listen. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Did you uncover anything of what he was doing during that day while his child was out in the car? UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Yes. UNIDENTIFIED MALE: OK. What did you uncover? UNIDENTIFIED MALE: He was having up to six different conversations with different women, it appeared from the messages, from Kick (ph) mostly, which is a messaging service. UNIDENTIFIED MALE: And is that a computer-related messaging service? UNIDENTIFIED MALE: It is. UNIDENTIFIED MALE: And these conversations he was having with these females, were these --. UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Now, did you actually -- have you located every one of these girls that he`s had contact with? UNIDENTIFIED MALE: I have not. UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Have you located any of them? UNIDENTIFIED MALE: I`ve located... (END VIDEO CLIP) GRACE: OK, take a look at the defendant. The first time he registers any emotion is when all this comes out. Now he`s starting to look around. Keep watching. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) UNIDENTIFIED MALE: And what did she say? UNIDENTIFIED MALE: She stated? UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Yes, she did. UNIDENTIFIED MALE: OK. Now I`m going to turn your attention. Was there also another girl that you met... (END VIDEO CLIP) GRACE: Tons of objections have just been lodged. And you see the defendant now resigned to the fact that all of this is coming into evidence, with his wife sitting one or two rows just behind him. He actually asks for bond, as if she`s going to let him back in the house after this. But this is tip of the iceberg. The sexting is frankly not relevant to the death of the child in that baking hot car. Joining us at the courthouse, Clark Goldband. We`ve all been in court all day long. Clark, what did you observe? CLARK GOLDBAND, NANCY GRACE PRODUCER: Well, Nancy, I have to tell you, you and I have been at this now about 10 years. This is the first court hearing I can remember attending where you had audible gasps from the hundreds of people in the courtroom, and laughing. It was one of the more bizarre scenes we`ve ever seen. But Nancy, a lot of questions you`ve gotten on this very subject from our audience -- the life insurance. It came to light today there were, in fact, two life insurance policies, one $2,000, the other $25,000, totalling 27 grand on this little child. GRACE: Unleash the lawyers. Veteran trial lawyer in this jurisdiction, Peter Odom. Also, Kirby Clements, veteran trial lawyer also in the same jurisdiction. First to you, Peter Odom. Now, call me crazy, but I don`t have life insurance... PETER ODOM, DEFENSE ATTORNEY: You`re crazy. GRACE: ... on my children. What is he thinking, taking out life insurance policies on a toddler boy? ODOM: Nancy, I was in court today. And I heard the even that the life insurance policy for $25,000 was taken out long before these events occurred... GRACE: In 2012, to be precise. ODOM: Exactly. So you know... GRACE: Two years. ODOM: And the other policy was... (CROSSTALK) GRACE: ... you say that`s a long time ago. It was two years. ODOM: Oh, it was... GRACE: And we don`t even know the date. ODOM: It was before... GRACE: It could be less than two years. ODOM: ... an Internet search. It was before the Internet searches. It was before -- and also, the life insurance policy... GRACE: You don`t know that. ODOM: ... the other life insurance policy was from work. GRACE: You don`t know that! OK, can I ask you this? UNIDENTIFIED MALE: He didn`t take out a life insurance policy... GRACE: When your children... (CROSSTALK) GRACE: When your children were 22 months old, did you have life insurance policies on them? KIRBY CLEMENTS, DEFENSE ATTORNEY: Those things come in the mail, Nancy. ODOM: Why does that matter, whether I did or not? GRACE: OK. All right. So I`m going to take that as a no. And Kirby Clements, those things do not just come in the mail. I`ve never once gotten... CLEMENTS: Really? GRACE: ... a solicitation to buy life insurance on my children? CLEMENTS: I get those all the time. GRACE: On your children? On your children? CLEMENTS: On my children. GRACE: Now, you know what? CLEMENTS: I understood the question. It`s on my children. GRACE: You show me one! You bring one! We keep talking about... CLEMENTS: I will do that. GRACE: ... about motivation? All right. All right, gentlemen, let`s have a throwdown and talk about motivation. You want to pooh-pooh the life insurance policy? You want to pooh-pooh him sexting and sending pictures of his erect penis while his child is baking in the car? Let`s talk about his computer searches. And I don`t mean for underage girls. I am talking about searches for a child-free life, a child-free life. Now, I know you guys were in the courtroom. But back to you, Clark Goldband. Explain to our viewers that were not in the courtroom, like all of us were today -- tell me what he was looking up about a child-free life. And I`m going to get to him watching videos of people dying in a few moments. But let`s just start with the child-free life. GOLDBAND: Sure. And Nancy, these are all allegations from authorities. But what came out of this -- let me break it down. There`s this blog called Reddit... GRACE: Wait a minute! Wait a minute! GOLDBAND: ... and you can post and ask questions... GRACE: Wait a minute, Clark! Now, when you start up, These are all just allegations -- this is sworn testimony from the lead detective on this case... GOLDBAND: Yes, ma`am. GRACE: ... who has sworn under oath to the judge, Judge Fox (sic), that he has searched the defendant`s computers and his iPhones. GOLDBAND: Yes. GRACE: And this is what he found. GOLDBAND: Yes. GRACE: All right? So this is sworn testimony, OK? Go ahead, please. GOLDBAND: Yes, ma`am. You got it. There`s a blog, Reddit. On this blog, there`s tons of categories. He clicked on what`s called a childless marriage or child-free life. And authorities say that he was exploring the posts in this blog about living with no children or not having any other children, Nancy. GRACE: OK. Another thing that came up in court today -- unleash the lawyers again, Peter Odom, Kirby Clements -- is he states to somebody, I guess there at Chick-fil-A -- he puts the -- he goes into Chick-fil-A. He normally goes by himself. He takes the child into Chick-fil-A. Everybody sees the child. He goes out to (ph) Chick-fil-A. When he gets out of the Chick-fil-A, he says to somebody -- he kisses the boy and he says something about, You know, I always kiss him as we get into the car because, you know, he might die. We might have a wreck. This may be the last time I see him, and I want him to know that I kissed him. All right, you know what? That is just damning, Kirby Clements. How can you two sit there like, you know, you`re listening to PBS right now? I mean... ODOM: The facts are that`s what he said during his interrogation. That was after the fact. GRACE: OK. ODOM: He didn`t say that to someone at the... GRACE: Yes. So he kissed his child... ODOM: After the fact. GRACE: ... at Chick-fil-A... ODOM: After the fact. GRACE: ... before his child dies. He`s saying that`s when he kissed him. And also, you know what else we learned, Peter Odom? We learned that with this rear-facing carseat, he is almost even with the daddy. He`s almost even with the father`s body as the father is driving the car, Peter Odom. I mean, how can you forget that? ODOM: According to the policeman. GRACE: Yes. And? (CROSSTALK) ODOM: It`s a subject of disagreement, Nancy. He told the police that he couldn`t see the kid from there. And really, it`s a matter of speculation. GRACE: OK, you know what? I`ll tell you what Maddox... UNIDENTIFIED MALE: He was behind him, by the way. GRACE: ... Kilgore should have done, the defense lawyer in this case, who`s a very fine lawyer, used to work in the Georgia attorney general`s office -- he should have waived this preliminary hearing. And I`ll tell you why. Because before the preliminary hearing, there were about 11,000 people on an on-line petition to drop charges that thought maybe Daddy just had a tragic accident. What about it, Odom? But now that`s been decimated. ODOM: Nancy, I completely agree with you. And here`s why. The state really laid out a strong circumstantial case against him. It`s circumstantial. There`s no direct evidence. But any question that this is just an innocent man has now been blown out the window. GRACE: And... ODOM: Now, there are still avenues of defense here. GRACE: And Kirby Clements, another thing, I watched him very carefully. He sat stoically until the issue of him sexting and sending pictures of his erect penis to other women -- one of them underage, by the way. That`s the first time he showed emotion. The detective had been up there talking about the child`s dead body for an hour, and he sat there without even blinking an eye, practically! But you say sexting and penis, and boom, he was angry! He said something to his lawyer. His lawyer jumped up -- Kilgore ran up and made an objection. I think I would have just kept quiet because the more Kilgore objected, the worse it got. It just got worse. CLEMENTS: But he had to do that. But his lawyer had to do that. And I just suggest, just because you don`t know what was going on emotionally as he`s hearing this story about his son dying and his son`s death. -- that was very traumatic stuff. You can`t sit there and... GRACE: OK... CLEMENTS: ... tell your lawyer, Object to that. I`m just pointing out, Nancy, that the mere fact that his behavior seemed erratic to you does not mean that... GRACE: Really? CLEMENTS: ... he was not truly grieving for his son. GRACE: Oh, OK. All right. Let`s take a listen to what happened regarding the stench in that car when Daddy gets back in and then makes his way to a movie. Take a listen. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Did he approach the car at any point at the scene? UNIDENTIFIED MALE: He did. UNIDENTIFIED MALE: About how long after the defendant had pulled over? UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Over an hour. UNIDENTIFIED MALE: And when he approached the car and stuck his head in -- did he stick his head in? UNIDENTIFIED MALE: He did. UNIDENTIFIED MALE: When he did that, was there anything of note that he noticed an hour and 20 minutes after with the door open? UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Yes. There was a foul odor or stench coming from the vehicle. UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Now, did you actually access that vehicle later, as well? UNIDENTIFIED MALE: I did. UNIDENTIFIED MALE: And why did you do that? UNIDENTIFIED MALE: We executed a search warrant on that vehicle later on that night. UNIDENTIFIED MALE: When you executed that search warrant and you went inside that vehicle hours later, did you notice anything? UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Yes. It smelled like -- there was a foul odor. It smelled like decomposition or death. UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Now, just to prove the elements this crime (INAUDIBLE) did you speak with the ME about whether this child would have suffered cruel or excessive physical pain? UNIDENTIFIED MALE: We did. UNIDENTIFIED MALE: OK. What did he say? Would it have been a painful death? UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Yes. UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Did you notice any -- were there any injuries to the child`s face? UNIDENTIFIED MALE: There were. UNIDENTIFIED MALE: And what were those? UNIDENTIFIED MALE:? UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Yes. There were abrasions to the back of the child`s head. (END VIDEO CLIP) (COMMERCIAL BREAK) (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) UNIDENTIFIED MALE: These messages and these chats -- they start in the morning? UNIDENTIFIED MALE: They do. UNIDENTIFIED MALE: OK. And do they continue throughout the day? UNIDENTIFIED MALE: They do. UNIDENTIFIED MALE: And when did they end? UNIDENTIFIED MALE: About 3:00 o`clock that afternoon. UNIDENTIFIED MALE: So about an hour before he left. UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Overrule the objection. UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Now, the 16-year-old girl, were these chats -- or now 17 -- they started when she was 16? UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Correct. UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Did these -- were these sexually involved, as well? UNIDENTIFIED MALE: They were. UNIDENTIFIED MALE:. (END VIDEO CLIP) GRACE: Not only do we learn in the last hours -- there you see the father, Ross Cooper (sic) in a court of law. And he`s getting disturbed because all of his sexting with six different women while his child bakes dead is coming out in court, with his wife chewing gum two seats behind him. Also, though, let`s get your mind off the sexting and the erect penis and all that for a moment. Another thing came out. Out to you, Haisten Willis, joining us at the courthouse, "Marietta Daily Journal." We also learn that he looked at multiple videos of people dying, dying under all sorts of unusual and odd circumstances. Who in their right mind would go from one video to the next on line, watching people die, in the throes of death? WILLIS: I was told by several people ahead of this hearing that I`ll be shocked today. And I can tell you that I was shocked by what I heard in those hearings. GRACE: Everyone, we are live and taking your calls. In the last hours, a dramatic showdown in a court of law, where we learned cops say a tot bakes dead in a hot car as Daddy`s sexting six women and has taken out nearly $30,000 in life insurance on the tot. Take a listen to this testimony. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) UNIDENTIFIED MALE: -- and looking at these sub-Reddits, turning your attention to less than two months before this child`s death, did he go to any topics pertinent to this case... (END VIDEO CLIP) GRACE: Unleash the lawyers, Peter Odom and Kirby Clements, both former prosecutors, both now defense attorneys who practice in that courthouse. OK, Peter Odom, who is looking up videos to watch people die, to watch them in the throes of death shortly before your own child dies because of your actions? ODOM: Two things. GRACE: OK. ODOM: First of all, that Web site`s out there. Lots of people that have not committed any murders look at it. GRACE: Why? Why? ODOM: I was snooping through... GRACE: Why would you look... ODOM: Listen to me! Listen to me! GRACE: ... at people dying? ODOM: Listen to me! I was flipping through cable the other day. What did I find? A television show called "1,000 Ways to Die," where they sketched out and filmed and recreated all these ways people die. I hope no one ever arrests me for murder for watching that show. GRACE: OK, you were... ODOM: That`s some of the weakest evidence that the state came up with on that. GRACE: ... flipping through. You did not look up the videos and then click on one after the next. And can I ask you, on "1,000 Ways to Die"... ODOM: It doesn`t matter. GRACE: ... does it actually show people in the throes of death? Don`t lie because I can look it up, Peter Odom. Did you actually sit there and watch one human after the next in the throes of death? Did you? ODOM: It was a show -- it was a show that re-enacted them. GRACE: Yes, no? (CROSSTALK) ODOM: Did I do what he did? No. GRACE: That`s like watching Jessica Fletcher in "Murder She Wrote," all right? It`s not the same thing. Kirby Clements, are you now trying to tell me that that doesn`t make a connection in your brain, ding ding, Daddy looks up people in the throes of death, and then suddenly, his child dies in a hot car? CLEMENTS: It doesn`t make any connection, Nancy. GRACE: No. OK. CLEMENTS: And I`ll tell you why. Number one, Daddy`s not looking up videos of children dying in a hot car. That`s number one. GRACE: Actually, he did. (CROSSTALK) CLEMENTS: They`re not showing videos of actual children dying in a hot car, Nancy. GRACE: Put him up. Put him up! CLEMENTS: They`re not showing videos of children dying. GRACE: You just... CLEMENTS: That didn`t happen. GRACE: ... served it up to me... CLEMENTS: They did not show... GRACE: ... on a silver platter. CLEMENTS: ... any videos of any child dying. GRACE: You put it up on the Christmas tree for me! Thank you for the present. CLEMENTS: There`s a video of a kid dying in a hot car, Nancy? Is that a video there (ph) GRACE: Actually -- actually, not only did he look at people in the throes of death, he also looked up how long it would take, how much time is needed for a child to die in a hot car. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) GRACE: In the last hours, a dramatic courtroom showdown as this man, Ross Harris, in court facing allegations he left his toddler boy to bake in a hot car as he sexts women inside of work at Home Depot. Also, we learn not only did he look up video of people in the throes of death, he also looked up this. Take a look. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) DR. ERNIE WARD, VETERINARIAN: You have no control over what`s happening. You don`t understand what`s happening. You just know that your body is getting so overheated that you can be in real danger. I mean, this kills. And it`s a lousy way to die. OK, made it, 30 minutes, 30 minutes in a parked car with the windows cracked. The temperature right now is about 115, 116, really hot. What I really wanted to set out to do was see how it felt to be left in a parked car if I were a dog. And I know what`s going on. I`m in control of the situation. (END VIDEO CLIP) GRACE: And with us, the man that made that video -- and it has become so significant in this trial because just prior to the boy`s death, Dr. Ernie Ward, doctor of veterinary medicine, made this video to help create awareness of animals dying in hot cars. And this dad looks it up and watches this just before his son dies in a hot car, left there by him. Dr. Ward, thank you for being with us. What was the air temperature on the day you shot the video, and what were you experiencing? WARD: Yes, Nancy. Like so many millions of Americans, I`ve been shocked by the developments of today. That video was shot on a typical Southern day, 95 degrees outside. And the difference is all four windows in my car experiment were cracked. I don`t believe this toddler even had that. GRACE: And the fact that this guy, this father, looks up your video just before he leaves his child to die in a baking hot car -- you were trying to help people with your video, right? WARD: And we have. And this video has saved countless lives. We`ve even passed legislation here in North Carolina to allow law enforcement officers to do a better job at accessing dogs that are left in cars. So we know that it`s making a positive difference. This is just a very -- you know, if these allegations are true, this is a very sick and depraved individual who accessed all types of information. GRACE: You are seeing what father Ross Cooper (sic) downloaded and observed just before his own child dies in a baking hot car. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) UNIDENTIFIED MALE: The child appeared wide awake and happy. UNIDENTIFIED MALE: What he was doing during that day while his child was out in the car. UNIDENTIFIED MALE: He`s having up to six different conversations with different women. Sexting. No tears, no, you know, real emotion coming out. UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Photos being sent back and forth between these women during this day while the child is out in the car. UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Yes. There were photos of his exposed penis, erect penis being sent. UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Now the 16-year-old girl, did she send him a picture that day? UNIDENTIFIED MALE: She did. UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Of what? UNIDENTIFIED MALE: She sent a picture of her exposed breasts. UNIDENTIFIED MALE: And did he send any pictures to her? UNIDENTIFIED MALE: He did. He sent her picture of his exposed erect penis. He also did a search, how to survive prison. (INAUDIBLE) called Child Free. And Child Free is a -- people who advocate living child free. UNIDENTIFIED MALE: He wanted to live a child-free life or there`s evidence to suggest that. (END VIDEO CLIP) GRACE: Breaking news tonight. Welcome back, everyone. The courthouse is just now emptying after a dramatic courtroom showdown. Ross Cooper in court -- Ross Harris in court today facing charges he let his toddler boy, Cooper, die in a baking-hot car as he sexts multiple women sending pictures of his erect penis as his child was dying. Not only this, and this is what is staggering to me. Out to Clark Goldband and Haisten Willis standing by at the courthouse. Clark, when I heard what the mother said -- OK. First of all, she goes to daycare to go pick up the child, can`t find the child. GOLDBAND: Yes. GRACE: And they go, well, you know, your husband never brought the child. The very first thing she said was, "Ross must have left him in the car." Now, see, if I couldn`t find my husband or children, my fear would be they had a wreck, or are they somewhere, and I`m supposed to be there? Are they at pizza or Lego and I`m in the wrong place? GOLDBAND: Right. GRACE: I would never think my husband left the children in the car all day. That`s the first thing she said. But that`s not it, Clark. Clark, this is what really stunned me. So she goes -- she goes to the father. She goes to Ross Harris. He`s in the interrogation room. And the first thing she says is, "well, did you say too much?" Now did I get that wrong? GOLDBAND: Correct, Nancy. GRACE: Did she say anything else first? Like pray for the baby. She didn`t even want to go see the baby. She wanted to go to her husband. I mean, I can`t get my head around that. GOLDBAND: No, Nancy -- GRACE: OK. You tell me. GOLDBAND: No, Nancy, and that`s what -- sure. And that`s what has just come out right behind us here at the courthouse out here in Marietta, Georgia. It was truly stunning. Authorities say she goes to the daycare to pick up the child. And when she`s at the daycare, she says, oh, no, when she realizes the child`s not there, he must have left the child in the car. But, Nancy, we learn that the employees of the daycare start to console her. Oh, no, no, no, that`s not -- you know, we don`t know that. I`m sure maybe they went out for lunch. There`s a lot of explanations. But that was the first thing the mom said according to court testimony. And Nancy, I want to tell you one thing that I`m not sure that everyone saw on camera. The D.A. was sitting in the first row behind the state. And as the defense was pleading and pleading for this to be tossed out, one of the defense attorneys made a comparison to forgetting to leave your food in the car. Food in a take-out container. And I turned to the D.A. and he ever so quietly shook his head from side to side. GRACE: Comparing the boy to leaving food in the car. And also, another thing, I want to get this straight, Clark. Because maybe -- GOLDBAND: Yes, Nancy. GRACE: I was trying to hang on every word. But the way I understood it, the mom -- and you were sitting, let`s see that picture. You apparently were sitting right in front of her. I couldn`t tell where exactly you were. But there you are. She`s right behind you. I don`t know if you realized you were sitting right in front of the mother in court. GOLDBAND: Yes. It was a very unusual spot, Nancy. Yes, it was quite an unusual spot. Because she was right behind me. And the -- her husband, the dad, was right in front of me. So I was kind of sandwiched between the two. GRACE: Clark. Clark. Clark. Clark, did she cry? GOLDBAND: You know, it appeared she did at times. It was hard for me to see because I had to turn over my shoulder like this. But there were quite a few times her head was down, she was holding hands of those on her left and her right. There were times she was being consoled with an arm around her shoulder. GRACE: Clark, Clark, Clark, Clark. GOLDBAND: There were times she was taking deep breaths. GRACE: Clark, you`re saying her head was down. I`m asking you, did you see tears? GOLDBAND: I personally cannot tell you that she cried, no. GRACE: OK. I want to get -- I want to just make sure I understand this. Let`s go to the lawyers. Everybody`s been in the courtroom today, Peter Odom, Kirby Clements. Peter, did you hear this the way I heard it? That the mother finds out her baby is dead, OK? He`s baked dead in a car that daddy left him in the car. She doesn`t want to go to the baby. She goes to her husband, who`s in police interrogation. ODOM: And the police do what they often do. GRACE: And the first thing she says is -- let me check. "Well, did you say too much?" ODOM: That is one of the things she said. But as I heard the testimony live in court, they were having a conversation and he was telling her about his statement to the police. She asked if he talked to the police. He acknowledged that he did. And the question that the officers said they have on tape is, did you say too much? GRACE: OK. Back -- ODOM: Well, your facts are correct. GRACE: Back to you, Haisten Willis. If we`re going to split hairs, I`ll be happy to split hairs. Haisten Willis, I don`t -- I don`t recall anything from today`s testimony where the mother goes in the interrogation room and she`s crying, she`s hysterical, she`s screaming, she`s upset about the baby, she`s beside herself, she`s just found out her baby is dead. But she has the wherewithal to say, well, did you say too much? That`s what I heard. Did I miss something? WILLIS: That`s what I heard as well. And I actually was sitting on the same row as the -- as Leanna Harris was today. She had her head down at times. I did not see her cry the entire time the hearing lasted. GRACE: OK, Leslie Austin, psychotherapist, joining me out of New York. I know the defense is going to argue until their blue in the face. And there`s no playbook for grief. All right? I will agree with that. But in line with that, I`m stunned the first thing that she says is, did you talk to the cops? Did you say too much? How can you say too much? Your baby is dead. What does she possibly mean, did you say too much? DR. LESLIE AUSTIN, PSYCHOTHERAPIST: Well, Nancy, there`s no playbook for grief, but there is a reasonable expectation that you would be concerned that your child has just died. Her focus is entirely on her husband and the police procedures. And there`s a pattern here of too much information being revealed by not very smart parents. So yes, you`d expect her to show much more grief and not be preoccupied with the husband. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) UNIDENTIFIED MALE: These messages and these chats, they start in the morning? UNIDENTIFIED MALE: They do. UNIDENTIFIED MALE: OK. And do they continue throughout the day? UNIDENTIFIED MALE: They do. UNIDENTIFIED MALE: And when did they end? UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Around 3:00 that afternoon. UNIDENTIFIED MALE: So about an hour before he left. UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Overrule the objection. UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Now the 16-year-old girl, were these chats of the -- or now 17, they start when she was 16. UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Correct. UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Did these -- were these sexually involved as well? UNIDENTIFIED MALE: They were. UNIDENTIFIED MALE: OK. Did she send him a picture that day? UNIDENTIFIED MALE: She did. UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Of what? (END VIDEO CLIP) GRACE: One of the first things we learn is that the father, Ross Harris, spent the morning sexting with six different women and sending pictures of his penis erect to them. One of them has just turned 17. While his child baked in the car. But let`s not talk about his penis for just one moment, and let`s talk about the forensics. Because -- out to John Lucich, former criminal investigator, president of Koji Forensics, John, thank you for being with us. John, a lot was made of the text that were sent that day, but noticeably it was stated that there were no texts during the day between him and his wife. Now what I think they should -- but he was texting through interoffice texting with his friends and all of these women, sending naked photos to them back and forth. I think they need to look, John, at his regular pattern of texting with his wife. Because if they both purposefully didn`t text that day and they usually send 30 or 40 messages a day, I think that would speak volumes. JOHN LUCICH, FORMER CRIMINAL INVESTIGATOR: Absolutely, Nancy. In fact, it`s going to tell you that they`re purposely not doing it to show that they had no contact and this was planned. But you can see that it was planned long before. The forensic investigators who are assigned to do the computer forensics on this case will be able to date and time every one of those searches. They`ll be able to date and time the dates of the insurance company. They`ll be able to find out what he was doing online to look for insurance. What other searches he was doing and put this all together. There is no doubt what you`re seeing on all these digital devices, whether it`d be a cell phone or a computer or anything, is now coming together and tying this up into one solid case against these individuals. And you can actually see him starting to live that child-free life that he was searching for. GRACE: You know, well put, John Lucich. Back to Clark Goldband. Clark, I did hear when the defense was cross examining, asked, Killgore asked about a 3:16 p.m. text that daddy sends to mommy, Leanna. And I`m quoting. "When are you going to get my buddy?" But there was not a return text. GOLDBAND: Yes. GRACE: And the detective didn`t know anything about that. And when the wife goes to the daycare to pick up baby Cooper, the first thing she says is, Ross left him in the car. I mean, nobody had told her that yet. GOLDBAND: Well, and Nancy, when we were in court there appeared to be some confusion over if the dad was actually running late to see the movie or wanted to leave early so he wouldn`t be late to see the movie. There seems to be some inconsistency over the nexus of that time. GRACE: You know, you`re right, Clark, because at one juncture he told everybody he was going to be late, but then he told police he left super early, before 4:00, to get to the movie. And then he drove for likes like seven, eight minutes with the stench of death in the car that was still there an hour and a half later but he didn`t notice? OK. We`re going to go straight back to the courthouse. But right now, "CNN HEROES." (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) JOSH LUCAS, CNN HERO PRESENTER: CNN Hero Dale Beatty. ANDERSON COOPER, CNN ANCHOR: Since being honored as a "TOP 10 CNN HERO" last year, Dale Beatty and his group have nearly doubled their efforts to modify or help provide homes for disabled veterans. With 1,000 applications received, the group`s new chapters will bring more neighbors together to meet those needs. TARYN DAVIS, CNN 2011 HERO: I come bearing widows. COOPER: 2011 Hero Taryn Davis has now helped more than 1600 young military widows find a network of support. Last year she launched an education program that empowers widows as they move forward. JAKE WOOD, CNN 2012 HERO: I`m going to go through and I`m going to number the beds. COOPER: 2012 Hero Jake Wood`s disaster relief group made up of military veterans has increased its network of volunteers tenfold. Now 16,000 strong, their teams have already responded to 12 disasters this year. MARY CORTANI, CNN 2012 HERO: Pick up the pace. COOPER: With the help of 2012`s Mary Cortani, dozens more veterans are managing their PTSD and moving forward in life with their service dogs. CORTANI: There you go. Walk with confidence, relax. COOPER: Cortani`s group is now employing veterans and has expanded its efforts to Southern California. ROY FOSTER, CNN 2009 HERO: There will be no man left behind as long as we are this nation. COOPER: In 2009 Roy Foster and his nonprofit have now assisted more than 7,000 veterans, men and women struggling with addiction and homelessness. Their new job training and placement program has so far helped 50 vets gain employment. With new projects on the horizon, these heroes show that service to community never gets tired. It just keeps growing. (END VIDEOTAPE) (COMMERCIAL BREAK) GRACE: Welcome back. We are live. Everyone just now filtering out of that courtroom. A dramatic showdown with horrendous and horrific facts coming to light. Did daddy knowingly leave his 22-month-old toddler boy Cooper in a hot car to bake to his death? Joining me, Dr. Vincent DiMaio, forensic pathologist joining me out of San Antonio. Dr. DiMaio, thank you for being with us. What do you make of the police officer saying that nearly two years later the stench of death was still in the car. How could the father not have noticed it? DR. VINCENT DIMAIO, M.D., FORMER CHIEF MEDICAL EXAMINER, BEXAR COUNTY, FORENSIC PATHOLOGIST: He had to have noticed it because that would have been within a few hours because of the extreme temperatures. There would have been decomposition. The child would have loosened his bowels, there would have been fecal material rotting in this close environment. The temperature would have been 40, 50 degrees higher than the outside temperature. And the temperature would have only taken an hour to go up that high. So within an hour the child was exposed to temperatures of 130, 140 depending on how the car was oriented to the sun, maybe 150. GRACE: You know, another thing, with me Dr. Vincent DiMaio, renowned forensic pathologist joining me out of San Antonio. Dr. DiMaio, we heard testimony and I`m recalling all this off the top of my head where the child had scratched his face and it was an open wound, which suggested to me he was scratching at his neck and it had not coagulated because the blood quit pumping. Also there were abrasions on the back of the child`s -- back of his head. Well, I can imagine the child banging and banging trying to get out of that car seat at 22 months, screaming out for his father. What would that child have endured dying this way? DIMAIO: Well, of course it would have been tremendous emotional stress. But it`s even worse than that because in the end the child would have gone into convulsions. And you know, he may have been scratching his face and you know, banging his head while he was in convulsions. And the heat also interferes with coagulation of the blood so there may have been some internal bleeding as well. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) GRACE: Welcome back, everyone. Just now everyone finally has left the courtroom. Let`s go straight out to the courthouse. Standing by, Haisten Wills and Clark Goldband. All of us have been watching the testimony today. Clark Goldband, another thing that I notice is that the state really tipped their hand about motive, about having a miserable marriage and wanting to have a, quote, "child free life." And I haven`t even talked about the money issue, that the life insurance policy was going to use -- GOLDBAND: Right. I was just going to say, Nancy -- GRACE: Go ahead, what? GOLDBAND: Yes, Nancy, I was just going to say, you didn`t even mention there and you had just started to. the financial motive that came up in this hearing as well. And authorities really started to hammer on that. The defense tried to counter by saying you haven`t seen the statements, right? You haven`t seen the documents, right? But Nancy, as you so wisely just said, you can see where this is going. GRACE: Well, another thing to Haisten Willis, the state may not have the documents yet because you`ve got to get those through the bank, but didn`t the wife say Leanna Harris say something about her husband charging up $4,000 dollars on some kind of a splurge purchase, and they had an argument about it and they were watching their finances? MILLS: She did, but it was a little bit vague. Sounded like it was 4,000 to me and that kind of -- you know, is it really 4,000? Is it approximately? She did say he is totally in control of the finances in the home and she did not seem like she was happy about that. GRACE: Another thing I noticed is that the father said -- unleash the lawyers, Peter Odom and Kirby Clements. After the mom walks into the interrogation room with the police, the first thing mommy says, I`ve said this before, is did you say too much? Shortly after that the father says, and I`m quoting, "I dreaded how he would look." "I dreaded how he would look"? Why did he dread it? How did he have time to dread it? Why would he dread it, Peter Odom? He walked out the car. He went to the car at lunchtime and made sure that his friends were with him from work. He insisted they take him to Home Depot to get light bulbs. Then he threw the light bulbs, threw light bulbs, into the car. Came back out, somebody approached the car, he kind of got between them and the car, and this is all on video. And wouldn`t bet the pedestrian get close to the car. He said, I dreaded how he would look. What about that, Peter, very quickly? ODOM: That could mean many things, Nancy. GRACE: Really? What? ODOM: I mean, you`re saying that it means -- GRACE: What did it mean? ODOM: That he knew that the kid was there and he was dreading how he might look. It also could mean that he noticed the kid was dead then -- GRACE: OK. Hold on. They`re telling me we`re out of time. ODOM: And those few minutes. GRACE: Everybody, as we leave the courthouse now, it`s the end of the courtroom day. What a day in American justice. To all of you like us who love America, happy July 4th. I`ll see you tomorrow night, 8:00 sharp Eastern. And until then, good night, friend.Okay, as I promised, I'm going to explain some shit.
There will be nothing but plain text, but if you really care, you would read on.
OKAY. Where do I begin?
WHY DID I TURN INTO AN ASSHOLE?
Okay, first off, to be honest, the day Meagan, or, more known to you guys as ROSE of the long dead account 'xrosekittyx', was pretty much the day I got mentally unstable. It did not help that the first college I went to sucked dick, and everyone was a high class bastard, that all were better than me. That hit me hard. My cousins who had been my guardians at the time because my parents were abroad in the Middle East, and they did not take one bit of shit of care for me. They fucked shit up and it was too late when me and my brother found out that my cousin and her sicko husband were stealing ALL my PARENT'S hard earned money which they send overseas to ME but I never got notice of it. We lost a large amount of money, wasted on drugs and other shit I do not now, and care not for.
At this point, I just lost my shit. I was a chubby guy, but because of my cousin's negligence, I lost weight. A meal was basically just plain rice and old stale potato chips. Now, I now I may sound like a weak asshole, but get this fact straight: If I did something physically, I will get KILLED. I am not exaggerating. First off, my cousins know people, possibly armed friends. Second I had NO IDEA this was all taking place at the time. I took their lies, and fucked up.
One thing you guys may or may not know is that my depression has worsened over the days that passed. I absolutely cannot contain and/or control it, so sometimes I act normal, but the next, I burst out in a raging depressed self. For simplicity's sake, let us call my unstable self 'R'. At School, I grew more and more unsociable and I isolated myself from pretty much everyone I know, and in the DA timeline, that was when I became inactive, and started to create other Accounts to try and start new, but I just became lonelier and further into isolation. 'R' took over, and by this time, I started a fight in school because of constant bickering and bullying. I knew I started something which caused my respect to disappear. I Unofficially Dropped myself from college.
I became...well...R was EXTREMELY aggressive. Not only to others, but to me.
I started...
Let's not go to that.
My Resolution?
After news of what happened, and my big brother realizing the truth from a tip from someone who knew my fucked up cousins, called up my mom, and she returned home.
Shit did not go down well, but in the end, my fucker of a cousin was kicked out. FOR GOOD. NEVER TO RETURN. They left their own ids behind too. Fucking morons. My mother returned to the Middle East with my dad, and returned after one more year of working there, as my dad's contract had ended and he was retired.
With my parents back, I had someone to look up to and share problems.
They were back, and I was going to be okay.
Or so I thought.
R never left. He was always there. I have fits now and then. I realized. What I had to go through as a child in high-school, added by the ignorance and isolation of me in my Early College days took their toll. I am physically healthy. But my mental state has slowly dwindled by years.
I'm now in another College, and now in my Second year. I have good friends. But of course, R fucks shit up, and I lose a few for good, but that's okay. There are people who are too close to me to separate. There is a girl who I love because of how much she helps me with my mental state. She understands. The Teachers are chill.
As of now, R has last recently been active 2 weeks ago. I am still recovering from a mental breakdown after an argument with a classmate.
I'm doing good so far, education wise, and social wise. I'm fine as of now.
What made me come back though?
The memories that have always stayed here.
..
The Future?
You may all think I will come back to this account.
That's what I thought too.
I checked out my gallery and attempted to delete and fix some stuff..but to my surprise, it's fucked up to hell and back. I am unable to delete things anymore.
So I am stuck with a 'non-working' account. I am not going to deal with DA support, because honestly, I'm fine with this account being in this state. It serves as a...memoir of some sorts.
So what now?
This is important and VERY EMPIRICAL FOR YOU TO UNDERSTAND.

Hi as a photographer who shoots smaller college sports (baseball, Basketball, hockey, and Soccer) here in Massachusetts. I would like to suggest that you need to make a couple of adjustments.
First as another poster wrote, shutter speed, it really needs to be 250th minimum unless your really good at panning and anticipating. 500th would be more ideal. Lighting in most ice rinks usually pushes the ISO to 3200-6400 range on the D700 even with a 2.8 lens. I normally shoot 2.8 to f4 depending on lighting.
Shooting sports takes a different set of photographys skills. I know many accomplished photographers amature and pro that struggle shooting sports played in low light conditions. Having played college baseball back in the day. I can normally anticipate what is going to happen and where.
Spending a good amount of time watching the players practice before the game can tell you the speed at which they play at or other skills they might have. So when they get the puck or ball you want to be ready for something to happen.
The images above were shot in better lighting than you will see at an ice rink or basket ball game, but it was having an idea of where they were going to go that helped me be in position to get the shot.
In the first shot I knew the runner was most likely going do to the count at the plate and how the fact he was taking a bigger lead off. Instead of trying to follow him with the camera, I panned to 2nd base and prefocused there and waited.
Hope this helps

Court.
Court officers issued summonses to 37 people Thursday in connection with the singing protest at the Brooklyn courthouse, said state court spokesman David Bookstaver. He said such protests have happened frequently in recent weeks, with the protesters issued summonses each time.
Ms. Kadet’s sister, Meredith Kadet of Inwood, N.Y., was among those detained in Thursday’s protest. She described herself as a member of Occupy Faith, one of the protest groups which sought to interrupt the foreclosure proceedings.
The Wall Street Journal, through a spokeswoman, called for the charge against Anne Kadet to be dropped.
“Anne’s arrest, while reporting on a matter of public interest, is an outrage and a clear violation of the First Amendment,” said Ashley Huston, vice president of corporate communications for the Journal and Dow Jones, in a statement. “The officers’ actions were completely unjustified, and we will insist that the charge for disorderly conduct be withdrawn immediately.”
Mr. Bookstaver, the court spokesman, noted that Ms. Kadet hadn’t identified herself as a journalist while in court. ”If your company is concerned, it would be best to provide journalists with a working press card so they can be identified as such,” he said. “Your reporter was standing up along with protesters with no credentials to distinguish her as a journalist.”
Ms. Kadet said the courtroom had been warned beforehand to be quiet or else face contempt of court charges, so she mostly held her tongue during the arrest. Court officers also ordered her to remain silent after she was handcuffed, she said.
Mr. Bookstaver also said that Ms. Kadet’s family link to a protester made the line between journalist and participant “a little bit blurry,” although he said the relationship was only established after both women were arrested.
Ms. Kadet is a senior writer for SmartMoney magazine and the Metro Money columnist for the Journal’s Greater New York section. Both publications are owned by News Corp.Browsing Theses by Author "Dejene, Bekele"

We can dive into her voting record on another day, but for now let's pause to note that yesterday was her first standalone "no" vote on a piece of full-council legislation—against council bill 118043 (née council bill 117996, but it was renamed for procedural reasons) which authorizes the city to receive anti-terrorism funds from the Department of Homeland Security.
That may ring a bell—it's the same kind of legislation that authorized the Seattle Police Department to quietly purchase the drones, surveillance cameras, and wireless mesh network (aka the potential cell-phone tracking network) that caused such an uproar when the public finally found out about them.
Iterations of that legislation (to accept Homeland Security funding) have been passed repeatedly since 2003 without significant public debate. But the SPD's drones in 2012 and Edward Snowden's revelations about the NSA's domestic spying programs in 2013 have problematized the rubber-stamping.
Yesterday, Sawant explained her reasons for voting no:
This year's legislation, council member Bruce Harrell explained yesterday (here is a link to video of the proceedings), has some noncontroversial elements, such as training for emergency response and setting up ways to alert citizens when an emergency is imminent.
But the DHS funding will also buy facial-recognition technology for the SPD and help support our local fusion center—which is currently involved in a lawsuit over the US Army's recent spying on antiwar activists and the fusion center placing photos of activists in its "domestic terrorism" files.
Yesterday, council member Harrell said he was voting for the DHS-funding bill because the facial-recognition technology—aka the "booking comparison system"—would simply automate a process that is now manual: That is, it would set up a database of photos taken when suspects are booked into jail, allowing digitized cross-referencing to other photos and producing search "hits" instead of officers having to manually look through photographs to compare them.
Harrell noted that Doug Klunder at the ACLU had approved the bill and had "no objections to the policy as written."
Harrell also addressed the issue of "mission creep" (a technology initially bought for benign reasons being used for increasingly nefarious ones) by saying a "very specific software usage law" would allow the city to audit exactly which officers are using the technology and for what purposes.
But privacy advocates say the policy is too weak to prevent abuse and that mission creep is inevitable. The same software, they charge, can compare driver's-license photos, Facebook photos, pictures taken of people at political demonstrations, and so on.
For one example of potential abuse, activist Phil Mocek points to an incident review from the May Day protests in 2012—which he got his hands on via a public-records request—showing high-ranking SPD brass requesting:
Photographs and information pertaining to all known anarchists/criminals and previously arrested `Occupy' demonstrators (p 4)
Photographs of all known/suspected anarchists and persons previously arrested during the recent `Occupy' demonstrations (p 5)
These requests were made before the protests—in effect, using criminal-investigation tools for political profiling.
"I am concerned that facial recognition software will allow SPD staff who collect digital images of a group of people engaging in civil disobedience (e.g., by holding signs and engaging in 'pedestrian interference' or 'failure to disburse')," Mocek continues, thereby "identifying people whose biometric data have been entered into various SPD databases, including but not limited to that which SPD intends to use with the booking comparison system."
Flagging such people as troublemakers, he says, could lead to activists "being yanked from the crowd and arrested, then either prosecuted on trumped-up charges, or allowed to leave hours later without charge, well after their effectiveness as demonstrators has been neutralized."
Does the idea of cops pulling "known" activists out of a crowd—based on a photograph—to arrest them on trumped-up charges sound farfetched?
Consider the case of Phil Chinn, one of the local activists spied on by the US Army, who was on his way to a protest, pulled over by Washington State Patrol, and charged with a DUI even though his breathalyzer and blood tests came back clean.
Chinn settled out of court.

Many folks get sick more often than they should. The reason is because they have poorly responding immune systems. A combination of environmental toxins, stressful lifestyles, lack of nutrition, sleep and exercise all contribute to weakening our immune system. How do we make it stronger so we can fight off infectious disease that is rising at an alarming pace?
Today we see a lot of people having allergy and/or asthma issues, missing a lot of school or work for common illnesses (sick all the time), and of course serious illnesses including cancer are devastating. Is there a way that you can improve your immune system so that your body has a better response to what threatens?
Scientists have discovered that we can improve and strengthen our immune systems by boosting the natural interferon in our bodies. All of the factors above may weaken your body’s ability to make natural interferon, but it is possible to counter that with a natural interferon supplement.
A natural immune builder supplement can enhance the natural interferon production in the body, making sure your cells are filled with interferon that helps fight disease attacks. Unlike an echinacea supplement that can boost the immune system for a short time (really good at fighting things like a cold, sore throat and other minor annoying illnesses), daily use of natural interferon can consistently power the immune system.
Building a strong immune system is a challenge. Our bodies are under constant stress. Every single day we are exposed to food, people and products that can make us sick. We have allergies and asthma situations that affect our lifestyle. We have immune illnesses and serious diseases like cancer.
Immune System Builders are targeted to build better health so that we can fight off all of the challenges we are presented with each day. Disease and illnesses, including cancer and hepatitis, make us sick because our immune systems are defeated before they can complete the fight. Thousands of man-made chemicals in our water, air and food have our bodies and our immune systems working harder than ever.
Do you know how your immune system works? It is actually working to try and keep us healthy constantly. Sometimes that isn’t enough. When substances enter our blood that are potentially harmful to us, the immune system attempts to destroy these invaders. However, if the immune system is not successful in reaching all of these invaders, we get sick.
Common illnesses such as colds, sore throats, the flu, etc. are illnesses that can be prevented. Allergies and asthma are common illnesses now. When the immune system is at its healthiest, it fights off these common illnesses much better. There are folks who have built up their immune systems who get very few colds or other illnesses.. not just per year.. but at all. On the other hand, many folks get sick 7, 10 or more times per year. Some seem to be always sick.
How do you build your immune system to an optimal level so that it will fight off viral invaders? There are a number of things that you can do such as to eat right, get enough sleep each night, exercise (yes, proven to make you healthier) and being careful to avoid direct contact with others who are sick (including washing your hands often if you are in close contact with such).
Since our lives are so busy, and our daily schedules do not allow us to eat the best each day, there is the option of supplementing your diet with vitamins, minerals, and other nutrients. Many more doctors than used to are now encouraging their patients to take vitamins because they know that our lifestyles do not include healthy eating every day.
There are safe and natural ways to supplement the immune system so that it will perform at peak levels. Natural interferon can stimulate your body’s immune system at the cellular level where its work is most important - inside your cells is where serious illnesses like cancer begin and is the reason why people supplement with natural interferon to help with prevention. When it is used daily, natural interferon can help your body fight prevent illnesses and can also give relief from challenges such as allergy and asthma symptoms.
The science, research, and clinical studies that are needed to create a powerful immune builder product that can effectively deliver the results in the form of a healthier immune system is something that many brands simply do not have. Brand to brand differences in quality, efficacy, and safety demand that one do the research and choose a brand that has the critical science behind the product.
One brand of natural interferon supplement stands out from the rest. The 40 years of research behind the ingredients, the safe and effective way it can greatly increase the body’s natural interferon production, and the unique formulation set it apart from any other immune builder. It is a blend of four powerful plant extracts: pumpkin seeds, safflower flower, Japanese Honeysuckle flower and Asian Plantain seed.
The combination of ingredients, and how they work together, is the result of the scientist who took all those years to get it right. He recognized how powerful the synergistic effect (of all four together ingredients) is and patented it. There really is no comparable product on the market.

A letter from a young Michigan cavalryman gives a vivid–
if ungrammatical–account of Gettysburg and its aftermath.
Submitted by Nancy Ronemus
"I counted 6 Reble Ofiser dead and wonded with in a short distance of each other. I heard on[e] hollering for a drink of water a short distance from me. I asked him who he was. He said Oh I am on the rong side but I gave him a drink of water and left him for I had to look out for my own head."
Those descriptive words are part of a 20-page diary written by Allen Rice, a member of the 6th Michigan Volunteer Cavalry, Company C, just nine weeks after he was at the Battle of Gettysburg. His diary was addressed to a friend, Abram Wear of St. Clair, Mich., answering Wear's request for "a full history of what I had passed through since I had bin a soldier."
Rice was 5 feet 4 inches and weighed 123 pounds, a blue-eyed farmer originally from Cayuga County, N.Y. He had lived three years in St. Clair before he enlisted at age 18 in the Michigan cavalry on September 7, 1862. They drilled for six weeks at Grand Rapids and wintered near Washington, D.C., and Fairfax, Va. On June 25, 1863, the 6th Michigan left Fairfax, headed for Pennsylvania and the Battle of Gettysburg.
Rice recounts the fierce action against Maj. Gen. James Ewell Brown Stuart's cavalry outside Gettysburg on July 3, 1863. The Michigan cavalry's defeat of Stuart there prevented the strong Southern cavalry from attacking the beleaguered Army of the Potomac at Gettysburg.
Rice also tells of a skirmish in a mountain gap (possibly Monterey) where his unit fought Robert E. Lee's retreating Rebels, capturing 250 wagons and 1,200 prisoners on the stormy night of July 4 following the Gettysburg battle. On August 25, the date of the letter, he was encamped four miles from Fredericksburg, Va., guarding prisoners.
Rice stayed with the regiment until dismissed at Fort Leavenworth, Kan., in 1865. He returned to New York, suffering from vertigo and rheumatism, and was able to do only light work in the woolen mills. He died in the Soldiers' and Sailors' Home in Bath, N.Y., on February 15, 1929, at the advanced age of 88.

Tom Agan rushed for 172 yards and three touchdowns and caught a 30-yard pass for another score as Elmira Notre Dame defeated Trumansburg, 40-32, Friday night in Section 4 football action, giving the Crusaders a victory in their long-awaited season-opener.
Notre Dame was forced to forfeit its game last week to Tioga due to a shortage of players. Ironically, Trumansburg (0-2) had its season-opener delayed as well - by a day last week as it needed a player to be cleared following a concussion to reach the minimum 16 players.

Thursday, May 14th, 2015
As far as color goes, did you know blue is the new black for event design? Take a look at these 27 hot catering trends that are being incorporated into weddings and parties more and more (via Social Tables)! Below are some of our favorites from the article! What trends pique your interest? We’d love to hear from you!
Trend #2: Blue is the New Black as Color Reigns
“Caterers are including a focus on color in the entire event design. This includes the floral arrangements, linens, lighting, furniture, china, silverware, decor items, as well as food. We are seeing creative ideas with color. For 2015, blue is the new black. You will see much more incorporation of blue into events.”
No matter what your color choice is, let us help you brainstorm not just what to cater, but how to stylize your event!
Trend #3: Creative Food Presentations
“It is more important than ever for caterers to make their food displays and plates look more attractive to the guests. The presentations can range from casual to formal, from outdoor picnics to formal galas. Food arrangements with the addition of props on the plates and/or displays, allow caterers to bring the themes to life for the guests. Through these creative components, caterers can make the guests feel more involved in the specialness of the event.”
Talk with us and The Rebel Florist about how to make your vision for the look of your event come to life!
Trend #15: Spice Up the Supporting Actors
“Embrace the creativity that homemade ingredients bring to surprise your attendees. Homemade ketchup, zippy salsa, stone ground mustard, and sriracha-based everything are a good start. Elevate the experiential aspect of dining by offering interactive pickling stations, or display the various stages of fermentation with hand crafted kimchi and kraut.”
Take a look at what inspired, tasty sauces our chefs at Butler’s Pantry partner with hors d’oeuvres and main courses!
Trend #16: Innovate the Classical Favorites
“Our signature dishes will always be requested and enjoyed; we may never remove them from our offerings. Instead, tweak their presentation and pairings to flex your guest’s culinary imaginations. Mini burgers, tuna cones, pork belly bao, individual poutine cast-iron skillets, hamachi with toasted rice, chicken and grits on a spoon… the sky’s the limit with reinventing traditional favorites.”
Ask us about our unique takes on classical favorites, like our Pork Belly BLT or Mini Adult Grilled Cheese with tomato vodka sauce.

I have both bullets and in an attempt to determine if they were the same, i discovered that the Dogtown bullet is .555 long and the Varmint Extreme is .560 long. This seems to indicate two different bullets/manufacturers.
Further investigation revealed that the Length to lands (in my gun) with the Dogtown was 2.333-4 and the length to lands with the varmint extreme was 2.338-9. This indicates that the ogive of the two bullets might be the same ie. .005 difference in the length to lands and .005 difference in bullet length. This might indicate the two bullets are made by the same manufacturer ie. the same bullet for both the Dogtown and varmint extreme.
I do not have a comparator to determine the exact overall length to lands, but i used the stoney point tool. This is probably not quite as exact as a comparator would be.
Also, has anyone shot the two bullets and compared them with the same load? (meaning everything the same except the bullet difference, seated with the same seating die setting).
I know there are a lot of varmint shooters in the bench rest crowd and I thought maybe there has been some investigation and testing with these two bullets.
Thanks
JayThe latest movie from hot rodder/filmmaker Brian Darwas arrives this summer to explore "The Sweet Sickness," chronicling the devotion for the original hot rod engine, the Ford flathead V8. Ford's more modern problems drew a host of comments, including this one from MaWeiTao about the responsibilities of a global economy:
The problem isn't that things are made in China. It's that American companies don't take responsibility for the products they have manufactured in China. There are companies having high quality products made there, but they do what's necessary to ensure consistent quality.
But then, why are Americans having manufacturing done in China? To cut costs of course. Which means they aren't concerned with things like quality. They're not going to do anything that adds expense. They basically send over some schematics and tell them to build it. If it's crap, they don't really care until called on it.
I've noticed this trend with American companies. Something comes from China with defects and these American companies absolve themselves of any responsibility by blaming the Chinese manufacturer.
"Those wacky Chinese are at it again!"
It's your own damn fault. You should have been on top of what the manufacturer was doing. These companies need to be held more directly responsible for the crap their Chinese manufacturers are building.Robotic Companion Animal Comforts People With Dementia

Country’s finest and more showed off their style for the 2013 CMT Awards. It was a bit less formal than the ACMs or CMAs (country music seemingly has an awards show every few weeks), so some superstars went more casual and shorter with their dress lengths.
For example, Taylor Swift wore a summery strapless frock with a short front and long back, while fellow blonde (and rumored nemesis) Carrie Underwood confused us in a mint green shorts suit that, despite her killer gams, wasn’t cute.
Here’s our roundup of the best and … not-so-best of the night..

WrongMX plugin needs a recipient address, and tries to fetch it from
a username under which spamassassin command is run, or by using a
signal_user_changed mechanism (option -u in spamc).
In the amavisd environment, SpamAssassin always runs under one
username (e.g. vscan), and the $self->{main}->{username} as used
in wrongmx.pm always returns 'vscan', with no domain, which
makes it useless to its purpose and it bails out. Another problem
is that wrongmx expects exactly one recipient, but a mail
message may have multiple recipients.
Amavisd does pass a list of recipients to SpamAssasin as
synthetic header fields X-Envelope-To (there may be more than
one such header field). WrongMX would need to be modified
to be able to deal with multiple recipients, and to collect
them from X-Envelope-To.

The banners bidding farewell to Fr. Dunstan Candol OSB were already gone-- San Beda Alabang and the regular Sunday mass goers seemed ready to move on.
The choir that sung beautifully during the Mass was Coro Benito-- a mixed group of young-looking talents, whose repertoire includes songs by Hillsong, Casting Crowns and Bukas Palad.
After communion, one of the members of Coro Benito came forward and reminded the congregation about "Christmas Blessings: Caroling at Salu-Salo," It will be held on December 10, Saturday, 8:00 p.m. at St. Benedict Chapel. It promises to be a memorable evening of songs and fellowship. Coro Benito will sing the carols and after their performance, the audience will be treated to traditional fare of puto bung-bong and bibingka.
To me, it is a worthwhile activity to support. Proceeds will go to Coro Benito's projects for marginalized youth and the repair of the chapel.
Before Fr. de Villa gave the final blessing, he thanked the congregation for the support for the tocino and chicharon that were being sold every Sunday just outside of the chapel. He was happy to reveal that he himself would oversee the production of these items, and that sales had been good that they could support 2 new scholars in the coming semester.
On our way out of the chapel, we stopped by to check the tocino-- too bad, somebody else got the last pack a few seconds ahead of us. And the chicharon was already finished even earlier that day.
We approached the table for donations to the "Christmas Blessings" project. We got 2 invitations.. 13/104,067, filed May 10, 2011, which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety.

1. Field of the Invention
This disclosure relates to the field of web-based services and more particularly to providing technology for the distributed processing, spatial organization, and web-based display of information.
2. Description of the Related Art
The World Wide Web has proven to be one of the most powerful technologies available today. Users interact with the web by executing certain actions on browser windows, which display the requested information in a variety of formats. A need exists to spatially organize and visually display this information using a variety of different spatial domains and visual renderings, while dramatically enhancing the interactivity of the user experience.
Described herein are methods and systems that enable the organization of information around a specific spatial domain. Further described herein are methods and systems for managing objects presented in visualization layers of a variety of spatial domains. The methods and systems may include methods and systems for associating an object with one or more spatial domains; presenting the object in a plurality of navigable visualization layers with dimensions that correspond to the dimensions of the spatial domain, the visualization layers having a navigation scheme for navigating within and among the visualization layers, wherein the visualization layers conform to a published application programming interface; assigning the object at least one attribute associated with a virtual property right in at least one spatial domain; and upon a user interaction with the object in the visualization layer, presenting information associated with the virtual property right(s) of the object.
Described herein are methods and systems for identifying a first spatial domain, associating a plurality of objects with the spatial domain, presenting the objects in a plurality of navigable visualization layers with dimensions that correspond to the dimensions of the spatial domain, the visualization layers having a navigation scheme for navigating within and among the visualization layers, wherein the visualization layers conform to a published map application programming interface, assigning the object at least one attribute associated with at least one virtual property right and upon a user interaction with the object in the visualization layer, presenting information associated with the virtual property right(s). Embodiments may further include methods and systems for creating, manipulating, updating, and changing information using a distributed computation engine. Embodiments may further include methods and systems for tracking a use of the virtual property right in order to attribute a value to the use of the virtual property right. In embodiments an owner of the virtual property right receives consideration upon usage of the virtual property right.
The methods and systems herein may effectively present resources of any networked environment, such as the internet, as a virtual computing platform. An interactive visual presentation, such as on a computing facility human interface, may provide an intuitive, responsive, web-based direct-manipulation user interface to this virtual platform.
These and other systems, methods, objects, features, and advantages of the present invention will be apparent to those skilled in the art from the following detailed description of the preferred embodiment and the drawings. All documents mentioned herein are hereby incorporated in their entirety by reference.
The invention and the following detailed description of certain embodiments thereof may be understood by reference to the following figures:

As used herein, the term “ZeeObject™” or “Zeetix Object” will be used to encompass a brand of object that has or may be associated with one or more defined spatial domains (which in embodiments may be arbitrarily defined) and that may be presented in one or more visualization layers, such layers being optionally navigable via a user interface and being optionally linked to permit navigation among the layers.
As used herein, the term “Mashup” or “Generic Mashup” will be used to encompass a website, “Web 2.0 application,” web service, domain, or similar content domain that uses content from more than one source to create a combined content item, such as a new website, new service, new application, or the like.
As used herein, the term “Zeetix™” or “Zeetix Mashup,” will be used to encompass a brand of object, such as a mash-up or similar object, that has one or more spatial domains (which may be arbitrarily defined) and that may be presented in one or more visualization layers, such layers being optionally navigable via a user interface and being optionally linked to permit navigation among the layers, and that is also comprised of one or more Zeetix objects, as described above. Every Zeetix or Zeetix Mashup is also a Zeetix object.
As used herein, the term “ZeeMap™” or “Zeetix Map” shall encompass one or more images accompanying a visualization layer within a spatial domain. A ZeeMap may optionally be of arbitrary dimension, such that spatial coordinates within the spatial domain map to locations within the ZeeMap. A ZeeMap may be supported by a collection of web-based elements built upon a published map application programming interface, such as, but not limited to, the Google Map Application Programming Interface (“API”), but a ZeetixMap is conceptually independent from the underlying rendering technology. Some, but not all, ZeeMap images are provided by Google and delivered via the Google API. Others are provided by a variety of sources and delivered to the user by the Google API. Finally, some ZeetixMaps are provided by a variety of sources and may be delivered to the user without the use of a published map API.
Thus, a Zeetix may, in embodiments, encompass a collection of information organized around a spatial domain, which may be around a geographical location in a real geography or a virtual geography, and all human-made constructs on it. For example, one common spatial domain is geography, such as maps and images of the earth\'s surface. A geographic Zeetix may show store locations for a franchise business, listing locations for a realtor, or police stations for a municipality. Another spatial domain may be a visualization of a specific biological pathway, containing annotation on potential drug targets, signal transduction cascades, disease pathways, biomarkers for diagnostic opportunities, or cellular localization for a metabolic pathway. A third spatial domain may be a genomic map of a particular organism showing the locations of gene variants, conserved regions, and similar annotations. Other spatial domains described herein or understood by those of ordinary skill in the art are encompassed herein and may be applicable to Zeetix objects, such as domains used in logical trees and hierarchies, network architectures, organization charts, graphs (including directed graphs), production pipelines, architectural drawings and blueprints, building designs, business locations, anatomical locations within a person, animal or plant, visualizations of a business process, production process, workflow, computer system or network, or the like.
As used herein, the term “ZeetixDomain™” shall mean a distinguished spatial domain that is a synthesized visualization (which may be associated with an arbitrarily defined spatial domain) of object entities in an environment, such that an object entity has a location in this spatial domain. In embodiments, the ZeetixDomain may include every such object, so that every object has a location in the domain. In embodiments every ZeeObject thus has a location in the ZeetixDomain in addition to any other spatial domain it may be associated with. A ZeeDomain may be represented with a custom ZeeMap. The ZeetixDomain may be presented in one or more Zeetices or Zeetix Mashups.
As used herein, the term “ZeeGuide™” or “Zeetix Guide” will be used to encompass one or more ZeeMaps and/or Zeetices, together with software, including user interface software, that associates information, data, and programs, including but not limited to ZeeObjects with one or more ZeeMaps and/or Zeetices in one or more ZeeDomains. A ZeeGuide may be considered as an interactive counterpart to an electronic document, such as those created with Word, Excel, and PowerPoint. A ZeeGuide may optionally be web-based.
Thus, in embodiments, a ZeeGuide might be presented in a window of web browser, divided into one pane that contains the ZeeMap and another pane that contains a tree of widgets that allows the user to manipulate the ZeeMap and the information presented within it.
As used herein, the term “ZeeTool™”, or “Zeetix Development Tool”, shall mean a tool (which may include a Zeetix, a software tool, a service (including a web service), a program, or the like) (optionally associated with one or more ZeetixDomains) and used to create, delete, browse, modify, manipulate, store, search, transmit, receive, query, view, or otherwise interact with any ZeeObject. A ZeeTool includes, but is not limited to, entities that correspond to more conventional development tools such as compilers, editors, debuggers, inspectors, report generators, database tools, services, web services, logging tools, version management tools, search tools, query tools, and similar tools.
Any Zeetix can be combined with any other Zeetix that shares a common spatial domain. This ability to synthesize “composite” Zeetices enables a rich variety of user experiences. For example, one Zeetix might provide an interactive store location map for Starbucks. Another Zeetix may provide an interactive map of municipal services such as bus stops, subway stations, and parking garages. The user can integrate these into a single Zeetix showing which bus stop, subway station, or parking garage is closest to a particular Starbucks location. An embodiment of these relationships is illustrated in FIG. 1.
In other embodiments a Zeetix may be combined with another Zeetix that has a different spatial domain, where the domains are linked, such as by visual presentation of the different spatial domains in proximity to each other. For example, a Zeetix showing an organization of retail stores within a company\'s hierarchy of retail stores may be associated with a geographical Zeetix that shows the physical locations of the stores.
As used herein, the term “ZDE™” or “Zeetix Development Environment” shall mean an environment (itself optionally a Zeetix) including one or more arbitrarily interconnected ZeetixTools sharing any number of ZeetixDomains. For example, one ZeetixTool might be a Python language code source-code browser, allowing a developer to create and edit Zeetix classes and methods expressed in the Python Language. Another ZeetixTool might be a debugger, allowing a developer to single-step through the execution of a particular method, showing the source code line-by-line, current values of variables and parameters, and presenting other visualizations of local and global system state. A developer can then integrate these into a single ZDE, allowing the developer to create, edit, and debug source code within the same ZDE, in embodiments all through a web browser.
A Zeetix may be enabled by a variety of technology platforms, including platforms for networked computing, such as network technologies (including broadband, wireless, LAN, WAN, Internet and other network technologies), computer technologies (such as computer systems that support high-performance graphical user interfaces), database technologies, computer programming technologies, such as cross-platform and cross-browser support for standard, non-proprietary, and expressive client-side scripting languages, technologies that support asynchronous communication between browsers and servers, allowing user interaction to occur in parallel with server communication, and technologies that support widespread availability of audio, video, and high-resolution still imagery.
A Zeetix may be supported by a collection of web-based elements built upon a published map application programming interface, such as, but not limited to, the Google Map Application Programming Interface (“API”), but Zeetix is conceptually independent from the underlying rendering technology. A Zeetix may be built by JavaScript within a web browser and may communicate via a common data format (e.g. eXtensible Markup Language (“XML”), RSS, HTML, or other data format) with a choice of any server-side programming language.
Zeetix may be maintained in several different ways, including through a development corporation and its franchisees, such as in a hosted computing or application server model of distribution. Zeetix users may have the ability to create a Zeetix server and cache, thus allowing Zeetix to service that community.
In certain embodiments, a Zeetix is an object-based method and system in which each ZeeObject may have one or more optionally immutable “versions”. A version of a ZeeObject may be created by dynamically changing an earlier version of the same ZeeObject or by creating an altogether new ZeeObject. This allows each version of each ZeeObject to be freely copied and cached. When a ZeeObject needs to change, a new version is optionally created to hold the resulting change. Thus, changes ripple through the distributed environment like waves through water. Producers publish changes by issuing a new set of versions. Consumers receive changes by choosing to load the new set, but in embodiments older sets can be always available. Versions may be associated with tags, hypertext links, metadata or other components to allow for recognition of attributes of particular versions, such as the author, date of creation, purpose, owner, or other attributes.
Each ZeeObject version optionally has a globally unique, persistent identifier of arbitrary length (a “ZeeTicket™”). In embodiments a Zeetix includes a collection of ZeeTickets. In embodiments Zeetix objects are constructed so that no two Zeetix objects have the same ZeeTicket. In embodiments a Zeetix object may be made persistent, so that once issued, a ZeeTicket and the object it identifies continue to be available. Physical constraints of the material world mean that for some ZeeTickets, the access time for the ZeeObject identified by a ZeeTicket might be arbitrarily long. For example, a human operator might need to locate and load an offline storage volume from an archival facility in order to respond to a request for a ZeeObject with an old and seldom referenced ZeeTicket.
A ZeeObject may be stored in a data storage facility, termed a Zeetix object store, or ZeeStore™, which may consist of a repository of ZeeObjects, optionally referenced by ZeeTickets. Each ZeeStore is itself an object and therefore has a ZeeTicket. A ZeeStore may contain objects that are copied from one or more other ZeeStores. In embodiments a ZeeStore may also contain new versions of ZeeObjects copied from one or more other ZeeStores. A ZeeStore may also contain newly constructed objects. In embodiments each new ZeeStore arises from an existing ZeeStore.
A ZeeObject cache, or ZeeCache™, may be a ZeeStore that does not create ZeeTickets or ZeeObjects. A ZeeCache may, for example, exist only in memory, or it may use some form of storage.
A Zeetix virtual system, or ZeeSys™, may optionally encompass an abstract system that exists only to execute a fragment of a program or process. A “process” creates a context within a specific physical system for a given program to execute. The process is created for that program (by a shell, for example) and disappears when the program terminates. A Zeetix Virtual System may optionally be an entire system created to execute a given process. A ZeeSys may be created in order to run that process and optionally disappear when the process finishes.
A program or process that requires capabilities not provided by an existing ZeeSys may be supported by the creation of a new ZeeSys “above” the first, such that the new ZeeSys provides the necessary capabilities. A dynamic “tower” of ZeeSys instances may be thus formed, each providing capabilities different from the ZeeSys instances above or below it in this “tower.” The term “level-shifting” refers to operations that shift execution up or down the levels of this ZeeSys tower. This ZeeSys tower thus may escape the limitation of a conventional virtual machine, such as the Java or dot-net virtual machines, which provides a relatively-fixed “greatest common denominator” of capabilities and cannot support programs or procedures that require capabilities not included in the virtual machine.
As used herein, the term Continuation, as context permits, should be understood to encompass a representation of the execution state of a program (for example, the “call-stack” or values of variables) at a certain point.
A ZeeSys is optionally a level-shifting processor that runs a program by explicitly running another program that interprets the first. The ZeeSys is optionally based on continuations, so each stage of a computation needs just enough resources to compute that stage and then invoke a continuation implicitly or explicitly associated with it.
The ZeeSys is optionally a causally reflective environment that optionally, like Java, contains a description of itself and, like Smalltalk, derives its behavior from its description of itself. Changing the self-description of a causally reflective environment changes the behavior of the environment. Changing the self-description of an environment like Java simply breaks the environment.
Combined with the ZeeStore, and exploiting the optional immutability of ZeeObject versions, a ZeeSys is thus maximally portable and scalable. Since Zeetix is optionally a pure object system, and since every distributed ZeeObject version is immutable, a ZeeSys can be instantiated whenever and wherever the necessary ZeeObjects are available.
Execution of a program or process within a ZeeSys may be more modular than in existing virtual machines. Creation of a ZeeSys is lightweight and fast. Thus, execution of an arbitrary number of programs or processes may be arbitrarily distributed among an arbitrary number of optionally-interconnected physical computer systems across the web. Zeetix thus optionally employs directed-graph computing, an alternative to grid computing through its creation of a distributed computation engine with globally unique persistent identifiers.
A Zeetix Engine™ may encompass the combination of one or more ZeeSys instances operating on an arbitrary number of ZeeObjects provided by an arbitrary number of optionally interconnected ZeeStore instances and, in certain embodiments, running on an arbitrary number of optionally interconnected physical computer systems distributed throughout the web.
In embodiments, browsers or servers can run as much or as little of one or more Zeetix Engines as they need, on a per-process, per-program, or even per-task basis. Thus, the effect is that the entire web becomes one or more emergent Zeetix engines, constantly adapting, evolving and tuning itself or themselves to the dynamic requirements of its users, hosting providers, and communication capabilities.
A “ZeeTrans™” or “Zeetix Transformer” as described herein may encompass an arbitrary number of arbitrarily interconnected programs or processes that convert one language representation of an entity into another. The transformation may use conventional data transformation techniques, such as parsing techniques, bridge-type data transformation techniques, message brokers, message queues, metabrokers, and the like.
A “ZeeBinding™” or “Zeetix Binding” as described herein shall encompass a binding, such as a Zeetix transformer that converts, where possible, between a canonical description language and a programming language, such as but not limited to Java, Javascript, Perl, Python, Smalltalk, Lisp, or any other language, together with the entities including, but not limited to, the data structures, memory, processes, objects, methods, classes and similar components that comprise a Zeetix. In embodiments a ZeeBinding may be a viewpoint or representation of a Zeetix or ZeeEngine, as opposed to a conversion or traversal of the entire Zeetix or ZeeEngine.
Through a Canonical Description Language (“CDL”) or similar description language and various ZeeBindings, a developer may use his or her programming language of choice, thus bootstrapping the growth of a vibrant developer community. For example, a Python developer could use a Python ZeeBinding, dynamically created by a Python language ZeeTrans applied to a ZeetixEngine such that the Python developer views the ZeetixEngine and all of its components in Python. A second developer could use a JavaScript ZeeBinding, dynamically created by a Javascript language ZeeTrans applied to the same ZeetixEngine such that the Javascript developer views the same ZeetixEngine and all of its components in Javascript. The Python and Javascript ZeeBindings binding allow the Python developer and Javascript developer equivalent, simultaneous and parallel access to ZeetixEngine\'s functionality. This equivalent, simultaneous, and parallel access specifically includes, but is not limited to, creating, editing, updating, and otherwise modifying data structures and code that is simultaneously visible to each developer.
Owing to its architecture, Zeetix can be accessed through any interface supporting a web client, including desktop and mobile devices. Indeed, some of the above examples are most powerful in a mobile context.- PeruRetail

Manchester United legend Ole Gunnar Solskjaer 'holding talks' with Aston Villa to replace sacked boss Alex McLeish
Manchester United hero Ole Gunnar Solskjaer is ‘holding talks’ with Aston Villa about the vacant manager role following Alex McLeish’s sacking.
The 39-year-old led Norwegian side Molde to their first ever title triumph after taking charge in November 2010.
And the ‘baby faced assassin’ is now the favourite to become Villa’s new boss after their controversial decision to hire ex-Birmingham City manager McLeish proved unfruitful after only 11 months.
A statement on Molde's website read: "Molde Football Club is aware of interest and contact from Aston Villa, and is aware that Aston Villa and Ole Gunnar Solskjaer are holding talks."
Solskjaer retired from playing in 2008 and spent two and half years in charge of Manchester United’s reserve team.
He then returned to his former club, which he played for between 1994 and 1996, and will be in the Champions League next season if he stays.
But American owner Randy Lerner confirmed that he is eager to see Solskjaer become Villa’s fourth manager in two years.
The striker gained legendary status at Old Trafford, where he made 366 appearances and scored 126 goals in 11 seasons, by netting an injury-time winner in the 1999 Champions League final against Bayern Munich.

Add new commentItaly, 29th May 2014 - Fashions come and go but menswear tends to have a few longstanding favorites, one of which is the bow tie. It is not very often that one gets to see men wearing bow ties, but this is exactly where its appeal lies. Carefully selected mens bow tie can make the wearer look unique and stylish, getting him plenty of the right kind of attention. There are a few companies that specialize in selling designer bow ties and their collection is sure to make a convert of many a casual dresser.
LuckyLusyano is a world famous manufacturer and retailer of designer bow ties for boys and men. Based in Italy, this company has a devoted following amongst stylish males of all ages who cannot resist Italian dress sense. This company makes nothing but high quality handmade bow ties. One of the secrets behind its success is the company’s excellent design team that comes up with unique and humorous designs that stay fashionable no matter what the current trends are. The designs are rich in detail, making them immensely attractive to people with a lot of taste.
Another important factor that has led to this company’s success is the painstaking attention to detail with which each of the ties is made. The ties are also made of high quality materials so that they pass even the most discerning critic’s eye. They are also packed so exquisitely that each tie is received by customers with great enthusiasm. Interestingly, each tie also comes with a Velcro closure so that it is easy to put on without any other person’s assistance; most people are unwilling to wear bow ties on account of the hooks that are quite hard to reach.
Fashion enthusiasts and connoisseurs of bow ties know that Lucky Lusyano ties will help them look stylish and unusual for any situation and it is not uncommon for people to have large collections of them. Buyers can choose from three categories of ties: Classic, Unique and Luxury. The company sells them via the internet and customers can expect to get them within a very short time via DHL delivery to any part of the world. More Information visit my site: -

Soft Spot Closing Too Fast/soon?
My sister was recently told by a doctor that her 4 week old sons soft spot was almost closed. I have never heard of this happening. The doctor told her "it's something to keep an eye on". (The doctor was an ER doctor, she thought he had an ear infection that's why he was in the ER). Her pediatrician has only seen him once and said nothing about it. He goes back next week and she will ask about it then. I was just wondering if this has happened to anyone else.

My son's closed faster than normally too causing a ridge in his forehead that became visible around 6 months. it is called a metopic ridge which can be really bad and cause the brain not to grow the way it is suppose too. we have had trips to Children's mercy for cat scans and his brain growth was and is still fine but it is somthing that my ped. said we will watch. he is now a healthy 21 month old and the ridge is still there but less noticeable as he gets older. I would suggest that your sister have it closely monitored by her ped. and look up information on the web bout soft spots closing too ealry.

That can be a big problem if it is true for such a little guy. When my daughter went in for her 9 month checkup her MD saw that her softspot was closed. We got sent to Children's Hospital that afternoon for x-rays to make sure that the bones were not fusing. Luckily for us, it was still technically open (not really) and nothing was fusing. They worry about that b/c if the bones fuse too early, the scull cannot grow or grow properly. They have to go in surgicaly to unfuse the sutures of the scull so baby's head can grow and not grow crooked. This isn't to freak you or your sister out but it is what happened to us and what we were told. Just have your sister ask and look into it herself. Good luck.

This is probably terrible advice! But, I was researching possible birth defects caused by taking Lexapro during pregnancy and I came across.
I have no idea beyond that paragraph right there anything about it or anything else! The best advice for your sister is to check with her own Dr. If she is really worried about it have her make a special appointment and have the Dr. look at it and talk to her about it, don't wait until the baby's next well visit. No reason to be worried when all you haev to do is have the Dr. look at it, I say.

We heard the same thing about our little boy at his 2 week old check up. Naturally, we were upset. The ped. said that they would be keep an eye on it and it was too soon to do anything. A few months later they sent us to a specialist and X-rays were done. Thankfully, he still had room for the brain to grow so we were ok. If the plates were growing too fast then they were going to do surgery to open up some space. There is a group at Children's Mercy who deal with this all the time. (I think that they are housed with the plastic surgery and celf palate group) Hayden ended up having Plagiocephaly on top of the concern about the plates growing too fast. He had to wear a helmet to shape his head. He only wore the helmet for a few months and has a great shaped head now.

I have a friend who had this happen to her baby boy. They went for scans, etc., and were told that his brain still had room to grow and they wouldn't need the surgery to make the room it needed. I'm sure it depends on every child and the situation, but the good news is, there is help for that these days!

My sons closed at 5 months of age. Everything is fine with him and he's now 20.
C.C. answers from St. Louis on January 29, 2009
Be sure she asks her doctor. I had a friend whose little girl (about 20 years ago) had her soft spot close too early. Her brain stopped growing as there was not enough room. She ended up being severely handicapped. Now, it's 20 years later, and I'm sure there are new things, preventions, etc. But, it should definitely be brought to the doctor's attention.
B.O. answers from St. Louis on January 31, 2009
I have friend whose son had to have the surgery at Childrens. His closed too soon and his head was deformed. He is doing fine now, surgery was a few months ago. A normal shape returned to his head and he seems fine. It is always scary but I think they have a good team down there and something that is done regularly. I hope they can avoid the surgery but if it is necessary it should all turn out fine in the end.

In the early-’90s, Chi-Ali created a buzz for himself as a child rapper rolling with the Native Tongues family. (He was the voice behind the Jeff character on certain De La Soul b-sides.) By the time of the new millennium though, Chi’s name was better associated with an appearance on America’s Most Wanted after he went on the run following the fatal shooting of someone his sister was dating. It was a rise and fall that resonated strongly with another young New Yorker, Skyzoo, who invoked Chi-Ali’s story on his plucky 9th Wonder-produced single “Jansport Strings.”
Now Sky’s pulled off a creative coup by getting Chi-Ali, who was recently released from jail, to rhyme on the remix of “Jansport Strings.” The remix showcases Chi-Ali’s first freedom rap since he was locked up and has him declaring how the track’s “got me feeling myself like it’s a throwback from 9-2,” while Sky tailors his own lyrics to welcome home his new guest. Hive caught up with Skyzoo to learn how the “Jansport Strings” remix went down.
What was the inspiration behind referring to Chi-Ali on “Jansport Strings”?
The reference ties back into why I initially started rapping. I feel as if me seeing that video (for Ali’s “Age Aint’ Nothing But a Number”) at nine-years-old prevented a lot of other things from happening in my life. Certain roads I could’ve went down were deterred due to me wanting to rap and wanting to be like that Chi-Ali video. That’s what it all ties into.
How did you feel when you heard he was on the run and in trouble with the law?
I was definitely surprised, and I began to follow the story immensely. I remember being glued to the TV when America’s Most Wanted showed his story the same way I was glued to the TV when I saw his video in ’91. The irony in that, you know? That’s what “Jansport Strings” is about: “My mama prayed that I wouldn’t be Chi-Ali/ Now my mama straight because I wanted to be Chi-Ali.” My mom raised me to not get into similar troubles and prayed that I wouldn’t go down roads like that, but I saw the other side of my Chi-Ali inspiration. I took lemons and made lemonade without knowing it.
Now Chi-Ali’s featured on the “Jansport Strings” remix. What does he bring to the track?
Well, besides him just literally being on the song, it’s one of the first verses he’s written since being home, so the intensity and hunger from the booth was as clear as day. He was excited to get back on the scene and work. The best thing about it is that he’s still got it. He can still get busy, so that was dope. Just seeing everything come full circle with the song and my career in regards to him being on a record with me, after he was the one who started this all for me? I’m honored. I’m honored like I could never describe.

Culley, Chief Executive Officer of Mast Therapeutics. "With enrollment on track and over $44 million on our balance sheet to begin 2014, we continue to see MST-188 as well-positioned to become the first drug to treat an ongoing vaso-occlusive crisis in patients with sickle cell disease. Considering the limited number of comprehensive sickle cell centers with the infrastructure to conduct a clinical study, we believe our ability to rapidly establish EPIC at 40 sites reflects strong interest in the study among physicians who treat these patients."
Based in part on physician enthusiasm for the study and the identification of otherwise eligible adult patient candidates, Mast has decided to amend the study's entry criteria to expand the genotype and age range. In parallel, the Company will add a limited number of adult centers to the 40 pediatric-focused sites that already are open to generate additional safety and efficacy data on MST-188 in the adult population. This decision was made following a determination by disease experts and the EPIC steering committee that expansion will not compromise the ability to enroll a sufficiently homogenous patient population and conduct a successful study. Given that most of the study investigators will be pediatric hematologists, the Company expects the majority of enrolled subjects will be children and young adults. and completion and potential success of the EPIC study, prospects for MST-188 in sickle cell disease, and.No Gap Straight Leg Pant 28-32

Have been away for the winter and on my return on March 1st I have been told by Shopper's and Metro that the wonderful gingerale of my youth VERNOR'S is no longer available in Ontario......I couldn't find it in Loblaws either...Anyone know if this is true or simply not available 'now' (this did happen a few years back)...Who knows what's up??
- re: Dean Tudor
Like Dean Tudor, I also find Vernor's lacks the gingery up-your-nose zing of when I was young and foolish. Still, it's the most gingery of the commercial ginger ales still available. And, from what I can see, it IS still available. Caplansky's Deli, I noted yesterday, has a ready supply in its cooler. And there were 12-can cartons of it stacked by the checkout at Pusateri's on Avenue Road last time I was there, albeit - as with everything else at that location - at a premium price.
- re: Dean Tudor
I know that diet Vernor's disappeared last year. I still see regular Vernor's around, but Vernor's hasn't tasted anything like Vernor's used to taste for many years now. It's flatter, sweeter, lacks bite, and has little ginger taste. The same thing was done to Canada Dry some years ago.
Dean Tudor, it isn't you!
I now use Aunt May's ginger syrup in seltzer for my fix. I wish Blenheim ginger ale (from South Carolina) was sold here.
- re: grandgourmand
Vernor's used to be the most gingery ginger ale available here. The Caribbean ginger beers (at least most of them) always have been stronger and remain so. Oddly, though, some Caribbean brands use artificial flavour.
Old Tyme was very nice, though I haven't had it in a few years. The last bottle I recall was bottled in New Jersey...
- re: paulcol
Hey thanks everyone...I don't remember Vernor's as being 'that' gingery either way back when or for that matter now..but that's actually why I like it...I've just come back from the winter in JA and they do have a 'local' gingerale made by D&G (yah, the same people Desmond & Geddoes who make(?)just about everything on the Island like Rum and many flavours of pop(soda) If you like a strong ginger taste you could try some of the D&G stuff ,probably will find it in most Jamaican stores around town..I find it too strong a taste for me.
Yes, Vernors is on the 'sweet' side but I am really a BIG fan and it's what I crave when drinking Gingerale plus it's what I grew up with...my relatives lived in Detroit when I was growing up and my Parents never came back to Toronto without the car being loaded down with Vernor's...the US relatives visited Toronto and always took back Crown Royal by the case! Fair enough eh!!!
I don't know if it is, but the Vernor's brand is apparently owned by Dr Pepper (see...) - you could try checking with their consumer relations department.
have bought Verners here last summer..........they have a real variety of sodas. Out of the way for public transit users, but they had loads.Rubel Hossain is Bangladesh's cricket hero and may soon be cleared of rape allegations

Senior staff writer Marjorie Mader, reported on a three-day learning lab led by world-leading paleontologist Paul Sereno and his team. The labs, provided to every student, were hands-on, project-based, authentic, and multidisciplinary. This archaeological exploration launched the 21st century education transformation that is ongoing in our district —, including by the U.S. Department of Education.
Throughout these years, we have leveraged a plethora of local and national resources to guide our innovation and design, including sessions with IDEO and Stanford's d.school, meetings with Denise Clarke Pope (co-founder, Stanford's Challenge Success), fifth that touches every teacher at Ormondale, every grade four and five teacher at Corte Madera School, and most teachers in the middle school. The real story is not about a tiny cohort of disgruntled teachers, but about an entire district and community pulling together to embrace new ways of learning.
In response to last week's article, over 170 families representing more than 300 signatures, including teachers, staff, administrators and parents, respectfully request that the Almanac print a retraction and return to its usual high standard of research and reporting and write a different cover article on 21st century education. We believe you will uncover the true story of Portola Valley's early adoption and ongoing leadership within the educational community.
Linda Yates and Jenn Kuhn are parents whose children attend Portola Valley schools, and wrote this guest opinion on behalf of some 300 district parents. Their names will be published in an advertisement in next week's Almanac.The Never-Ending Struggle to Simulate the West African Monsoon
Kothe, S., Luthi, D. and Ahrens, B. 2014. Analysis of the West African Monsoon system in the regional climate model COSMO-CLM. International Journal of Climatology 34: 481-493.
The three researchers report finding that (1) "in large parts of the African tropics, precipitation was underestimated by up to 50%," (2) "even larger overestimations occurred along the Western coastlines and the Ethiopian Highlands," (3) "an overestimation of precipitation in the Sahel region resulted from a northerly overextension of the monsoon system in the model simulations," (4) there was "a tendency of COSMO-CLM to produce too much convection," (5) "precipitation was underestimated in large parts of the African tropics," (6) there was "a negative bias (too low) in OLR [outgoing longwave radiation], arising from high convective clouds being far too optically thick (due to the excessive ice/liquid in the clouds)," (7) there was "a negative bias in precipitation (too much condensed water stays in clouds and does not rain out)," (8) "the convective activity of COSMO-CLM, measured by an OLR-based index, was especially over the Angola Basin much too high," (9) "precipitation was underestimated in large parts of the continental African tropics," and that (10) "the model strongly overestimated convection in particular over the Gulf of Guinea."
In concluding their study, Kothe et al. write "a lot of work has been done in the last years in the field of convection schemes (Braconnot et al., 2007; Zanis et al., 2009), but the convection schemes are still a major error source," with the result that "even with state-of-the-art climate models the simulation of complex atmospheric systems, such as the West African Monsoon, is still subject to errors (and will probably always be) [italics added for emphasis]," which is why the title of this review begins with the words "The Never-Ending Struggle."

Simply maintaining the status quo won't silence advocates of women bishops and there's growing pressure in all Christian churches to widen women's ministry, a commission chaired by Bishop Michael Nazir-Ali of Rochester said.
The church's General Synod could decide in February whether to proceed with formal consideration of female bishops and a proposal could be formalized in July, but a final decision would be years away.
The Church of England voted in 1992 to allow women priests but not bishops. Some now want the church to drop the women bishops prohibition, and abolish the system of ''flying bishops'' who supervise parishes that reject women priests.
Some opponents of women bishops want to reverse the church's 1992 decision and others want a formal structure for those parishes that cannot accept women bishops.
Anglican churches in New Zealand, Canada and the United States have women bishops. Last month, Australia's synod failed to provide women bishops the necessary two-thirds approval. Eleven other national churches have authorized women bishops, but have yet to elect any.
Eight Anglican national churches do not ordain women priests.Or, Rub Some Bacon on it

Special to The Gardner News
One Mayor bid adieu with British flair, while another Mayor was ushered in for a new era of Gardner City government on Monday, April 15.
Voters elected Chris Morrow as Gardner’s new mayor in the general election held on April 2 by a 52 percent margin.
City administrator Cheryl Harrison-Lee led the presentation to honor outgoing Mayor Dave Drovetta, new mayor Morrow, re-elected council member Kristy Harrison, new council member Steve Shute, and outgoing council member Randy Gregorcyk.
“This is one of those historic moments,” Harrison-Lee said, “And no one who achieves success does so without help.”
Drovetta was presented with a clock from the council that read, “Thank You For Your Time,” a frame with photos and a lifetime family pass to the Gardner Aquatic Center.
“What can a person say after 18 years of elected office?” he said. “It’s been a fun ride, and I learned a strong sense of humor is an important factor in navigating rough roads through my journey.”
He explained to attendees that he and his daughter would have British accent Mondays, and began to thank everyone in such fashion.
“Our community has been blessed with the hardest working, dedicated council regardless of demands,” he said. “I am fortunate to be associated with such wonderful people. I, also, thank the citizens for their confidence in serving this community, and giving me an enriching learning experience. I bid you all a fond, cheerio,” he said.
Council member Gregorcyk summed up his brief experience by thanking Drovetta, and congratulating Kristy Harrison and Steve Shute.
“I appreciate the opportunity, and will rally around our new team and mayor to move this city forward,” he said.
Harrison also thanked Drovetta for appointing her to the council three years ago, and being patient with her.
“I’m excited about the next four years,” she said. “And the visioning we are getting ready to endure will set the city up for success.”
Newly-elected Shute joked that he is the shortest member of the council.
“But it’s good to look up to people,” he said. “I have shoes to fill, and hope to have the support of those in this room.”
Shute declared Gardner the greatest city in Johnson County.
“I’ve always believed we are a hidden gem,” he said. “And it’s time to take us out of hiding, and make us the brightest star in Johnson County.”
New Mayor Morrow began by mentioning the bombing at the Boston Marathon, before proceeding to thank his family.
“They have been long suffering for a short time,” he said. “I’m looking forward to getting started this winter, as I’m a relative neophyte.”
He promised to work hard and listen to the people of Gardner.
“I will make sure to keep you informed and interested,” he said. “And I will help Gardner move forward, as I think we’re going to get a lot accomplished in the next four years.”
[…] Link: […]A group of scientists and representatives of indigenous Arctic communities has identified areas around the Arctic Ocean that they consider especially worthy of consideration for protection as sea ice recedes and industry poises to enter the increasingly accessible high northern latitudes. The report, released today by the Natural Resources Defense Council (NRDC) and the International Union for Conservation of Nature, maps out 13 areas that are of particular ecological and biological significance or are especially vulnerable to human intrusion. They range from the Bering Strait to perennial gaps in the ice off Russia and Greenland.
The predictable retreat of Arctic sea ice under global warming presents one last opportunity to adopt effective marine management practices before, rather than after, an ocean is opened up to development, says Lisa Speer of NRDC in New York City, who co-authored the workshop report. "It's been our experience that, once you have offshore oil and gas or shipping or fishing, it becomes much more difficult to protect key ecosystems," she says. "We haven't been proactive in the past. Now we have a short window of opportunity to do it right."
Implementing the report's recommendations—a total of 77 areas are flagged as worthy of protection—will be a challenge, however. The 13 highest-priority areas together cover almost the entire margin of the Arctic Ocean and include a broad swath of pack ice that should linger against northern Greenland and adjacent Canadian islands after the rest of the ice is gone. Any agreement will require cooperation among the eight Arctic nations, which include the United States and Russia. Foreign ministers of the Arctic Eight meet next month in Nuuk, Greenland, when the agenda will include management practices in the melting Arctic.try the selenium but if you get virtually nothing from printing it now, you won't get much after you selenium tone it.

2014!Facebook users spend an average of more than 15 hours a month on the social networking site.
While there are plenty who caution against such intensive use — and there are a number of studies detailing the harm Facebook could potentially cause — there also are lots of reports extolling the site's virtues.<p>
As the social media giant prepares for its upcoming initial public offering, here are seven ways Facebook just might be good for you.
Spending time on Facebook can help people relax, slow down their heart rate and decrease stress levels, according to researchers from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and the University of Milan.<p>
In a <a href= target=”_blank”>study published earlier this year</a>, researchers studied 30 students and found that a natural high was sparked when they were on the social media network that led to the relaxed heart rates and lower levels of stress and tension.<p>
In the study, the students were monitored in three situations: looking at panoramic landscapes, performing complicated mathematical equations and using Facebook. While the first situation was the most relaxing to students and the math problems were the most stressful, the time on Facebook uncovered high levels of attractiveness and arousal.<p>
The findings support the researchers' hypothesis that Facebook's success, as well as that of other social media networks, correlates to the specific positive mental and physical state users experience.
With a number of businesses already using Facebook research to rule out potential employees during key hiring situations, studies show they may soon be using it to determine who the best candidates are. <p>
A study by researchers at Northern Illinois University revealed that impressions from time spent perusing a candidate's Facebook page was a stronger predictor of their likelihood to excel in a job than the personality and IQ surveys many companies require potential employees to complete. <p>
Lead researcher Don Kluemper said the study consisted of asking "raters" to evaluate job candidates based on both Facebook pages and personality tests.<p>
"Our raters could look at the tone of a subject’s wall post, note the number of friends they have, peruse their photos to see how social they were and assess their tastes in books and music," <a href= target=”_blank”>Kluemper told NIU Today in February</a>. "We were able to conclude that after a five-minute perusal of a Facebook page, raters were able to answer questions regarding the subject about as reliably as would be expected of a significant other or close friend."<p>
When the researchers asked the candidates' current employers to evaluate them six months later, they found the initial Facebook evaluations were a more accurate predictor of success than other tools like personality and IQ tests.
Spending time on the social networking giant also makes people feel good about themselves, according to research.<p>
A study conducted by researchers at Cornell University was the first to show a psychological benefit to using Facebook, revealing that people get a self-esteem boost just by looking at their Facebook wall. <p>
Researcher Jeffrey Hancock said the results are most likely the effect of Facebook users being able to put their best image forward by choosing what they reveal about themselves. In addition, the positive feedback friends and family bring to a Facebook wall also contributes to the self-esteem boost. <p>
"Unlike a mirror, which reminds us of who we really are and may have a negative effect on self-esteem if that image does not match with our ideal, Facebook can show a positive version of ourselves," <a href= target=”_blank">Hancock told the Cornell Chronicle</a>. "We're not saying that it's a deceptive version of self, but it's a positive one."<p>
Hancock said the study was one of the first to show a psychological benefit to using Facebook.
Facebook isn't just good for your physical and mental health. It also can be good for your investments.<p>
A study last year by Pace University researchers found that <a href= target=”_blank”>the more popular a company was on Facebook, the better its stock price</a> seemed to be.<p>
"The study suggests a relationship between the popularity or greater numbers of people thinking and posting comments or sharing experiences about brands and the economic performance of the brand," said Pace University researcher Arthur O'Connor. "If everyone is thinking about and talking about your brand, that may mean something in terms of your stock price or corporate performance."<p>
O'Connor said the results create the potential for new applications of social media popularity metrics as economic indicators.
While many may argue that social media networks only distract employees, research shows the opposite may be true.<p>
Research from Keas.com found that a 10-minute <a href= target=”_blank”>Facebook break makes employees happier</a>, healthier and more productive.<p>
The study examined workers in. <p>
.
Facebook may help students get the college degree they've been seeking.<p>
Conducted by researchers at Abilene Christian University, a study found that students who were <a href= target=”_blank”>active on Facebook were less likely to drop out of school</a> than those who don't use the social network.<p>
The research examined nearly 400 first- and second-year college students. Most of the students that returned for their second year were significantly more active on Facebook than the ones who did not. <p>
The study also revealed that students who are active Facebook users show more enthusiasm for their college environment.
Facebook is also in the business of matchmaking. <p>
Research shows that nearly 60 percent of singles will friend someone new on Facebook after meeting them in person. If they like what they see, 25 percent are likely to <a href= target=”_blank”>contact their new love interest via Facebook</a>.<p>
Once the courting is over, nearly 40 percent of those social networking adults will update their relationship status on Facebook, with just 24 percent telling their friends first. <p>
Facebook use between couples will continue through the dating process, the research shows. Throughout the day, 79 percent of couples said they send partners Facebook messages or chat on the social network. In addition, more than 60 percent would post romantic messages on their significant other’s Facebook wall.<p>
When the relationship ends, more than half of those surveyed immediately update their status to single, which automatically sends out a notification to their friend list to start the dating cycle over again.><br><br>

It is hard to believe that Wham!’s “Last Christmas” was recorded over 26 years ago! And over the years, many artists and celebrities have covered the now Christmas classic song. See all the versions and vote on your favorite!
Wham!’s Original Song
This might be one of my favorite videos for the song. It really makes me want to go back into the 80’s and hang out on the slopes with [lastfm link_type=”artist_info”]George Michael[/lastfm]’s friends. Plus, it looks like George and his love interest then fought over the hair spray for a long time while shooting the music video. 2.5 million views on YouTube.
Cascada
[lastfm link_type=”artist_info”]Cascada[/lastfm]’s version of the song gives it an upbeat dance/electronic energy to the slow song to the point where you wanna fist pump your way through the song. The video cracks me up because her model ex-boyfriend doesn’t match up in appearance in her scrapbook, and all the photos are from catalogs and not really pictures of him. She could have done better than dancing in front of a green screen, but her party she’s throwing is kinda rockin’. My friends all say I look like her ex at the end of the music video, and I would agree…but he kind of creeps me out with the lick smack to her. 13.6 million views on YouTube.
Ashley Tisdale
There wasn’t even a music video for this song, so I used a lip-synched version of the song. It was pretty painful listening to the whole song as an adult, but I would think young kids would love Ashley Tisdale’s pop version of the song, especially if they were High School Musical fans. Not a fan of this version, but she does have some good stage presence. 119,0o0 YouTube Views
Taylor Swift
“Last Christmas” gets a country twist with [lastfm link_type=”artist_info”]Taylor Swift[/lastfm]’s version. There isn’t a music video for this one either, but it seems like a bunch of her fans love the hit by how many views just this one video has on YouTube. The song is pretty good, and it sounds different with the guitars and twangy notes. It just goes to show you that Taylor can sing pretty much anything and the song will become a hit. 3.3 Million views on YouTube.
Schaeffer
This is probably my favorite version of the song. I’ve never heard of this group before, but I love their acoustic, stripped down version of the song. There isn’t a music video for this song as well, but no need…the song is too incredible for one. And I have probably given this video all 2,700 views of the song on YouTube too.
Glee’s Version
I’ve only seen a couple episodes of Glee, but this week’s episode had the leading couple singing “Last Christmas” to each other. She doesn’t even care about picking out a Christmas tree or helping out her “ex” boyfriend. Her only thoughts is to try and harmonize with him. I do like their attempt at the song somewhat, but it isn’t a memorable one like other Glee songs I’ve heard before. 1,000 views on YouTube.
Crazy Frog
I was surprised that [lastfm link_type=”artist_info”]Crazy Frog[/lastfm] even covered this song! The computer animated “Annoying Thing” is jamming out with his random “Ding Dings!” and “Dong Dongs!” with the song sounding like Cascada’s version. The video is pretty good as he tries to save Santa from being locked up in a villain’s basement. 10.1 Million views on YouTube.

Friday, July 11, 2014
CEBU (Updated) -- An Australian with suspected links to Islamic extremists and his Filipina girlfriend were arrested by police inside their rented apartment in Barangay Pajac, Lapu-Lapu City, Cebu early Friday morning.
Chief Superintendent Prudencio Tom Bañas, Police Regional Office (PRO)-Central Visayas director, identified them as Robert Edward “Musa” Cerantonio, 29, of Melbourne, Australia and Joean Montayre, 32, of Tipolo, Mandaue City.
Quoting international police sources, Bañas said that Cerantonio is a global advocate of jihad, which is a war fought by Muslims to defend or spread their beliefs.

“He espouses jihad. Siguro hindi na siya gumagawa ng bomba (he may not make bombs), but then he does the convincing. He spreads the advocacy,” Bañas said in a press briefing.
An Associated Press report also said that Cerantonio was rallying support for militants in Syria.
Police served a warrant of deportation issued by the Bureau of Immigration (BI) after the Australian federal government cancelled Cerantonio’s passport once he was classified as a “person of interest.”
A joint police operation led by Senior Superintendent Conrado Capa, PRO-Central Visayas' deputy regional director for operations, went to the two-storey apartment at 5:30 a.m. with the warrant issued last Thursday night.
The couple was caught by surprise and Cerantonio, at one point, put his hands on the window to show he wasn’t armed.
Just research?
The police searched the whole apartment but found no substance or material that may be used in bomb-making. They only recovered a passport, mobile phones and some documents, which will be further examined.
Bañas said they didn’t recover any evidence that would link Cerantonio to any terrorist acts.
Montayre, 32, Cerantonio’s companion, said the Australian national came to the Philippines to do research about the country’s languages.
Cerantonio is a historian and a linguist and has been in the country for about a year, Montayre told Sun.Star Cebu at the Casuntingan Police Station in Mandaue City Friday afternoon. (Montayre spelled her first name as Joan during the interview with Sun.Star, but the ID obtained by authorities says her first name is Joean.)
Montayre, who hails from Barangay Tipolo, Mandaue City, was detained by the police after a hotel in Mandaue complained that she and Cerantonio had failed to pay their bills. She said she already talked with the hotel’s management to settle the unpaid bills.
Montayre said Cerantonio is vocal about his support for the Muslim uprising in the Middle East, but he is not connected with any terrorist organization.

‘Propaganda’
“If you speak the truth, if you talk against America, they always associate you with terrorism. That’s propaganda,” the freelance costume production designer said.
“He’s been here for many months and he didn’t do anything. He is being deported because he overstayed his visa and that’s about it,” she added.
The police told a different story.
Capa said the police learned about Cerantonio’s location last Saturday through the intelligence community, but that they began tracking him several months ago.
“As to where he went and where he was, we can’t disclose that so as not to jeopardize our follow-up operations,” Capa said.
Cerantonio was brought to Manila on Friday escorted by BI and police personnel. He will be turned over to the Australian federal police.
The local police team was composed of PRO-Central Visayas' Regional Intelligence Division, Regional Special Operations Group, Lapu-Lapu City Police Office’s Special Weapons and Tactics group, Explosives and Ordinance Division and a K-9 unit. The BI enforced the deportation.
During the press briefing, Bañas said there was no reason for the public to be alarmed regarding Cerantonio’s arrest, amid security preparations for the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (Apec) Summit in 2015.
‘No threat’
The Central Command of the Armed Forces of the Philippines (AFP), for their part, commended the police for arresting Cerantonio.
“There’s no threat of terrorism here in Visayas,” said Lt. Cdr. Jim Alagao, Centcom spokesperson.
The National Commission on Muslim Filipinos (NCMF)-Central Visayas said they appreciated the police’s action, but urged the authorities to respect Cerantonio’s rights.
Malo Manonggiring, NCMF-Central Visayas director, said the police ought to conduct a background investigation on Cerantonio to check reports describing him as a “jihadist preacher.”
“Allegation lang naman yan. Wala rin kaming idea na nandito siya (Those are merely allegations. We had no idea he was here in Cebu),” he told Sun.Star Cebu in a phone interview.
A report in theguardian.com stated that Cerantonio converted to Islam at 17 after a visit to the Vatican left him disillusioned with Catholicism. He was born to an Italian father and Irish mother.
Cerantonio, alias Musa, was calling for jihad and lecturing Muslim Filipinos to support the Islamic State militant group that controls parts of Iraq and Syria, police said. The group is also known as ISIS or ISIL.
ISIS ‘supporter’
A senior police official, who refused to be identified because he was not authorized to speak to the media, told the Associated Press that Cerantonio was monitored giving lectures on the need to support the ISIS movement in Basilan and Sulu.
The official said authorities were also looking into the possible involvement of Cerantonio in the circulation of an online video showing prisoners inside what appears to be a Manila penitentiary airing their full support to the ISIS movement.
Cerantonio’s online messages reportedly prompted the Australian Federal Police to investigate him for inciting Australians to fight in Syria.
Montayre, however, lamented that the Australian is being treated like a criminal for having many followers on social media.
Montayre said Cerantonio’s activities mainly focus on his language research. “All these things he does online, pakapin lang (he does only on the side),” she said.
“His country didn’t want him at first. When he left, they didn’t want him to come back. They were happy that he left...But now they want him back because they’re afraid he’s going to create an impact in support of what’s going on in the Middle East,” she said.
Sent to Manila
Montayre, who converted to Islam in 2007, said she is the only person the Australian knows in the Philippines. They had only been staying for two weeks in a rented apartment in Barangay Pajac, Lapu-Lapu City when the arrest took place.
Montayre said Cerantonio used to teach in a university in Australia and once hosted a TV show in Cairo, Egypt.
Cerantonio was detained at the Bureau of Immigration in Mandaue and escorted to the Mactan Cebu International Airport past 3 p.m. for his departure to Manila.
She said the Australian is a good person “who can’t even kill an ant.”
Cerantonio did not speak to media while being escorted to the custody of the immigration bureau in Manila. (With an Associated Press report/Sun.Star Cebu)

Although he often is described by modern writers as a man who wavered in the face of the secession of the Southern states, President James Buchanan authorized expedition that set sail 150 years ago to reinforce Fort Pickens. It was a movement that easily could have sparked the Civil War that leaders of both sides claimed to hope to avoid.
In a well-known secret, the U.S.S. Brooklyn steamed out of Hampton Roads, Virginia, en route to Pensacola Bay. On board were reinforcements for the beleaguered Union garrison of Fort Pickens, as well as needed supplies for the fort. The two companies of artillerymen were commanded by Captain Israel Vogdes.
The departure of the Brooklyn, a powerful steam and sail powered warship, was known immediately in the Southern states, as is evidenced by a report that appeared in the Richmond Daily Appeal the next day:
The U. S. steam sloop of war Brooklyn, which had been lying off Fort Monroe since her return from Charleston, went to sea yesterday on another peaceful mission. She. Before leaving Hampton Roads, however, she received on board, from the fort, two companies of artillery, under Capts. Vodges and Langhorne, a step which, we presume, is only precautionary. - Richmond Daily Appeal, January 24, 1861.
While the Richmond paper's account of the mission of the Brooklyn was inaccurate, its details regarding her destination and the strength of the army force aboard was startlingly correct. President Buchanan had ordered the vessel to proceed to Pensacola Bay where the troops under Captain Vogdes were to be landed to reinforce the garrison holding Fort Pickens. Vogdes would then take command of the fort from Lieutenant Adam J. Slemmer, who had been holding out in the face of repeated demands from state troops that he surrender the post.
The move by Buchanan held every potential of igniting the spark that would start war between North and South. Any attempt to reinforce Fort Pickens would likely cause Confederate forces not only to open fire on the Brooklyn but to launch an attempt to storm the fort. Blood would be shed and the fate of the Union and the newly declared Southern republics would be decided by a conflict of arms.

It seems you are unaware of the armistice agreed to on Jan 29, 1861 between the U.S. and the state of Florida, which stated the U.S. would not attempt to reinforce Ft. Pickens and the southern forces there in turn would not initiate hostilities against the fort.
This armistice was broken on the night of April 11th. when Capt. Vogdes, under orders from Gen Winfield Scott, reinforced the fort.
Rick,
If you continue to read the posts from January, you will see that I discuss the Fort Pickens Truce in considerable depth. The Brooklyn, actually sailed before the truce was negotiated. This post was part of a daily series that looked back on January of 1861, with notes about the events that happened each day during that critical month. The posts for later in the month discuss the truce.

But some themes just bear repeating.
She's repeated the "Please & Thank You" month several times. "Because we have children come in, and their manners are just like --- well," she says. "I have my little soapbox things."
HPL's storyline is an approximately two-minute recording of a children's story read by one of four volunteers. The stories change each week and anyone can call, 24 hours a day, to hear them.
"Please & Thank You" will be back in June. April's theme was "Mother Goose Rhymes" because a fellow library clerk met a group of preschoolers who had never heard a nursery rhyme. "I was like, 'you've gotta be kidding me!'" Baxter says. So she collected a handful of favorites. The last week in April, you could hear a kind-voiced older woman read several rhymes, including a skipping rhyme and the Peter Piper tongue twister.
Children's librarian Ann Gibson started the storyline in late 1979; Baxter took it over almost six years ago. "I realized I should have a 25th anniversary," she says. When the storyline began there were 1,000 to 1,500 calls a month, now the line averages only 180. Five volunteers read for her: a library employee, a member of the library Board of Trustees, a retired school administrator, and a pair of 23-year-old men who Baxter credits with boosting the call-in numbers because "they're just having so much fun with it."
Readers don't have to audition and rarely record the story more than once. "Normally if they make a little bit of a mistake or something," Baxter says, "it makes it more alive for the kids."
She chooses books in the library collection so children can come in and look at the book they heard on the phone. "Then they've gone one step further with loving reading," she says.
The storyline, with stories for preschool through second-grade children, is 334-6670.

Poverty. Look familiar?
When you get to work tomorrow morning, take a look around. Chances are someone you know, even a co-worker, is living in poverty.
Making poverty recognizable and breaking down misconceptions became the focus of "The Faces of Poverty: Not Just Faces, But Our Neighbors." The conference, which was organized by the Downtown Community Forum last Wednesday, is part of a collaborative effort to reach out to faith-based charities and churches in addressing Rochester's growing poverty problem.
And when it comes to poverty, the myths are everywhere. But they were roundly broken down by the "Faces" panelists. Michael Boucher, a social worker with St. Joseph's Neighborhood Center at 417 South Avenue, told of his frustrations in speaking to a colleague who also happened to be his doctor. "'Why don't they just go get a job?' my doctor asked. When you live in poverty, it's hard to be well enough to keep a job. And you probably don't have health insurance, so it becomes a circular problem. But listen to the misconceptions about poverty even among professionals in the field."
Cameron Community Ministries, 48 Cameron Street, is an ecumenical community center that provides clothing, after-school tutoring, and free hot lunches daily. Cameron has repeatedly intervened on behalf of school children with behavioral problems who have no stability in their lives, said Executive Director Kathy Pearce. "[One student] had moved so many times in one year that we felt we needed to try to keep her in the same school so she could build longer relationships," she said. And Cameron, Pearce said, was successful in making that happen.
Another panelist talked about how her own life began to mirror those of the people she was trying to help at Action for a Better Community. "I was living a double life hoping no one [at ABC] would discover my secret," said Karyn Herman, director. "My husband left while I was pregnant, and my son was born with a tumor on his liver. Suddenly, I was in trouble. I couldn't pay my bills and I didn't want anyone [at work] to know I was in this situation. And they didn't, because we had a Penfield address and people don't make a connection. They think of poverty and an address downtown."
The "Faces" collective is launching a letter-writing campaign to the House and Senate that considers the federal budget a "moral document" reflecting the values of the nation. The letters will appeal to lawmakers to increase spending for human services by not extending the income-tax cuts of 2001 and 2003.
A second conference, "From Poverty to Dignity & Decency for All" is planned for 5:30 p.m. on Thursday, May 12, at St. Luke Tabernacle, 1261 Dewey Avenue. It will continue at 8:30 a.m. on Friday, May 13, at the Aenon Baptist Church, 175 Genesee Street. To register, call Karyn Herman at 328-7550.

Harvesting support
Despite passing the state Assembly by an overwhelming majority in the past two legislative sessions, Senate Majority Leader Joseph Bruno has so far failed to bring the Farmworkers Fair Labor Practices Act (S5130/A1304) to the senate floor for a vote. This prompted Centro Independiente de Trabajadores Agricolas, or CITA, to organize a four-day "March For Justice" through the farm regions of Western New York on Saturday, April 30, before heading to Albany on May 3.
The bill would give farmworkers the same rights afforded to all other workers in the state --- one day a week of rest, disability insurance, overtime pay, collective bargaining protections, and health and safety provisions on the job. CITA points to farmworkers in Orleans County that were held in slave-like conditions by crew leaders last year. The crew leaders pled guilty in federal court to trafficking and forced-labor charges in December and are scheduled for sentencing this month.
"Farmworkers are ripe for more of the type of exploitation we have already seen," says Bill Abom, associate director for Rural & Migrant Ministry. "If the state's 'Pride of New York' campaign were really something to be proud of, you would think they would want to include fair treatment toward farmers."
More than 400 workers are hired during the peak growing season in the counties of Orleans and Genesee alone. "One reason small farms have been run out is the government's favoring toward the big farming companies," Abom says. "If you're small and you try to treat your workers fairly, you're putting yourself at a competitive disadvantage. The big guys hear all the scare tactics about how business will be ruined, costs will be too high and they can't compete. But they used the same tactics in California nearly 40 years ago. Guess what? None of it was true --- it's still the most successful farming region in the world."
The march drew more than 200 farmworkers and passed through Brockport, Rochester, Sodus, and Geneva, picking up some support from Senator Joe Robach, Mayor Bill Johnson, and Rochester Labor Council President Jim Bertolone. Senator Bruno agreed to meet with the farmworkers, who say they will present him with a state-wide petition urging him to bring the bill to the floor for a vote. His press office says the senator is supportive of issues facing farmworkers, like affordable housing, daycare, and workers’ comp. But he feels the bill being presented with an emphasis on collective bargaining that could drive both farming and consumer costs higher. He also believes the bill should be handled at the federal level, because farmworkers move from state to state.

By PopEater Staff Posted Apr 5th 2010 10:10AM
"That's not true," family patriarch Joe Jackson told PopEater of the suicide report. "I don't think they will win with that. It's just not true!"
Jackson is "resting and relaxing" at the family's Encino compound, but he and at least a dozen members of the famous family will be there to face the doctor charged with causing Michael's death.
However, any circus-like event that may spring up Monday could be over before it starts.
The hearing itself will be a procedural one -- the main objective will be to assign a judge to try the case, in addition to setting a date for the preliminary hearing. If Murray attends, he won't be opening his mouth. Murray has pleaded not guilty to a charge of involuntary manslaughter.
When the trial does begin, the new defense strategy could prove problematic for prosecutors.
Sources tell the TMZ that Murray admits to giving Jackson a 25 mg dose of Propofol, enough to keep a patient asleep for only 10 minutes. The defense will reportedly claim that Ativan and Versed already present in MJ's system created a "synergistic effect" that put the singer to sleep for much longer.
It's when Murray left the room briefly, his lawyers will argue, that Jackson awoke and injected the remainder of a 20 ml bottle of Propofol into his IV. This injection caused a massive overdose that stopped his heart.
Joe Jackson is in the process of suing Murray, whom he also believes waited too long to get his son to the hospital.
"I want justice for my son, that's all I want, justice," Jackson told PopEater of his civil suit. "Dr. Murray needs to talk and tell everything he knows. All I want is justice for my son's death."

- Music News-
- Celebrity Scandal-
- can't even figure out why the doctor's guilt is in question. OF COURSE he did it. He ordered the drugs and administered them. That's premeditation if you or I did it. Can't stand Joe Jackson, but I agree with him on this one.

You are right... I think Joe needs to leave it alone, MJ did not like his Dad. It's all about money with Joe. I think MJ would not be happy with his Dad again... The man is a mean man. He was mean to him.. Leave it alone I say. MJ was on drugs.....Drugs do stupid things and he was not thinking right, quit with the Doctor. Thanks

Hey Joe, crawl under your rock. You sucked all the life out of Mike when he was alive now your trying to suck the embalming fluid out of him now. Your a worthless P.O.S.

Dr. Murray keeps changing his story. I realize that desperation has set in, but he put himself in this situation. He had a duty of care for his patient, and he was negligent. Whoever was giving Michael those I.V.'s, wasn't qualified to do so. Their lack of expertise is the reason why Michael's veins had collasped. I wish someone from Mike's inner circle would have loved him enough to INSIST that he get help for his insomnia. Even if that meant taking drastic measures, to get help for him.

shut up. you sound stupid and disturbed. I swear people like you WISH michael was a criminal to fufil some sick fantasy you haven.

papa joe jackson has been living off his children's stardom since michael was on the sullivan show. but for all the money he;s gotten wasn't enough he looks like a lowlife he acts like a lowlife and he talks like a lowlife. the quotes about seeing justice done for his son sounds like he got help from jesse jackson or al show me the money sharpton. face it every one in the inner circle knows he was a junkie the same as elvis was. you can't have your doctor basically in your home almost 24/7. what joe jackson wants is to keep getting his name and his son's splattered on every tv show in america. before his death who ever wondered what jermian was doing or tito and also latoya was up to well we do know about latoya and her hot photos.the whole family has been touring telling everyone how much michael is missed i wonder how they felt about him being a pedifore. they'll all make as much as they can before america gets sick of them all

Joseph "living off" his children is no one's affair. Aside from Jacksons. I pray I live to care for my parents. Would be an honor. Michael is Joseph's son. Has a RIGHT to explanation as to untimely, and unnecessary death. Don't think he cares what people think. If he doesn't, I'd concur. No First Family Of Music minus him. Father in every, and any aspect you can imagine. So go ahead. Bash father. Bash son.

Addiction doesn't mean you deserve to die. If you die a "junkie", doesn't mean those who love and mourn you aren't entitled to some sort of an explanation. Physicians have an obligation to do what's in their patient's best interest. Always. NOTHING should change that.

While the class is required for all design majors, it's become a smash crossover hit, drawing in legions of students from Stanford's Business School, its School of Education, and even computer science majors.
That's evocative of what's happening at Jump, which is not so much a design firm as it is a firm focused intently on finding those kinds of opportunities and translating them into growth—across disciplines. Since 1997, Dev has worked closely to help America's biggest brands grow by leaps and bounds: GE, Nike, Procter & Gamble, Target, and Hewlett-Packard. But Jump's work rarely follows down the traditional product design path. Take, for example, what Dev and his team did for NBC. Jump provided the network with set of design principles to apply across their hit show Sunday Night Football. This includes everything from how they portray athletes off the field, to how they advertise, to what Jump calls the
"seriousness and humility" with which they broadcast. While they didn't design the
Web page or shoot the credits, Sunday night was never quite the same after Jump stepped in; just watch the cinematic opening of the Web site for a taste.
Dev has collected this wisdom in the book Wired to Care: How Companies Prosper When They Create Widespread Empathy,

empathy is the source of all innovation. He's even created the Empathometer, which ranks companies from high to low on the empathy gauge.

Pipe bombs
Another plot to cripple the Trans-Alaska Pipeline was foiled recently, reports the Philadelphia Inquirer (via Reuters). A Montana judge gets credit for apprehending the plotter, in Idaho, although Oregon and Washington are the main consumers of oil from Alaskan oil.
A year ago, we released the 2005 Cascadia Scorecard, which detailed the profound vulnerability of Cascadia's energy infrastructure (pdf), including the Trans-Alaska pipe.
The latest plot--which involved blowing up propane trucks along the pipeline, among other acts of sabotage elsewhere--doesn't seem to have been as far along as one in 1999 or one in late 2003. (Both described here (pdf), on pages 30-31.)
The larger story, of course, is that Cascadian officials have done little to secure its energy system in the past year. Pending energy security measures in Washington and Oregon may be bright spots on the horizon.

Prince(ss) of Tides
Since last Friday, I’m proud to announce, the venerable Cascadian news website Tidepool has been a project of NEW. Yep, we’ve completed a friendly takeover!
Since 1997, Tidepool has been highlighting the most significant news that’s shaping Cascadia. Every morning, Tidepool’s editors scan dozens of news sites and assemble the stories that will actually matter in Cascadia a few years hence—the slow news (pdf). It’s an essential service, and it’s one that thousands of Cascadians use every day.
Tidepool was seeking a new home, and its service is a natural complement for this blog and NEW’s other analyses of key trends in Cascadia. So both organizations are excited about the transfer. We think it’ll lead to big improvements all the way around—in the news digest, in the blog, and in our website.
Tidepool has long been a community asset—something kept healthy through the active support of its thousands of readers. This new phase in Tidepool’s development won’t change that fact; to the contrary, NEW will soon introduce more ways to participate in Tidepool’s evolution. If you’re not already a member of that community, please join by signing up for a free subscription.
For more information on NEW’s ownership—really, stewardship—of Tidepool, read this letter to its subscribers.
And meet the new NEW editor of Tidepool: Princess of Tides Kristin Kolb-Angelbeck.

Alaskan Oil: Fool's Gold
Continuing a three decade old argument over drilling for oil in Alaska’s Arctic National Wildlife Refuge (ANWR), the US Senate appears likely to make another important vote on the subject in the next 48 hours, according to US Senator John Kerry.
This issue is of interest to Cascadians because Alaska is the main source of Oregon and Washington's oil. (British Columbia runs on Albertan oil; Idaho and western Montana burn fuel from Billings, Montana.) Drilling proponents argue on the grounds of national security, but Alaskan oil is actually far less secure than you might assume. In fact, although it is drilled from American soil, it arrives in the continental United States the same way as oil from the Middle East: by ship.
And the means by which it reaches those ships is insecure: the Trans-Alaska Pipeline, a piece of infrastructure that is profoundly vulnerable to attack. We wrote, in Cascadia Scorecard 2005:
The Trans-Alaska is 800 miles long, sits elevated above the ground for more than 400 of those miles, and was long ago deemed indefensible by the Pentagon. It is aging and corroding and is near the end of its design life. It has already been sabotaged once, bombed twice, and shot more than 50 times, most recently in 2001 by a drunk with a hunting rifle. In 1999, a disgruntled Canadian ex-convict was apprehended just months before he had planned to blow up three key segments in midwinter, when repair could have taken months. He had begun assembling 14 sophisticated bombs and had pinpointed the pipeline’s weak points. Other near misses are much rumored but classified. The US Department of Homeland Security did reveal in 2004 that its late 2003 “elevated terror alert” was motivated by intelligence suggesting terrorists might attempt to ignite the fuel stockpiles at the pipeline’s Valdez terminus. The opening of the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge to oil extraction, if it happens, would redouble and extend Cascadia’s dependence on this single, insecure pipeline.
A winter pipeline attack at remote points along its length could halt oil transport from the North Slope until Spring. Some fear that the normally-heated oil might even congeal in the pipe, making the Trans-Alaska the "world's largest Chapstick." (This point, and some of what's quoted above, comes from the best in-depth analysis of the ANWR question that I’ve seen: Rocky Mountain Institute’s 2001 article in Foreign Affairs called "Fool's Gold in Alaska.")
(Washington Senator Maria Cantwell is leading opposition to drilling in the refuge. Oregon Senator Gordon Smith is among the small set of Republican senators who are bellwethers on the issue.)

Slim, smart, and lightweight, this ingenious cover is the perfect choice for protecting your NOOK HD+. The polyurethane exterior, accented by a subtle "nook" logo, is both strong and smooth to the touch; inside, a plastic shell cradles your device while offering full access to the controls. But that's only part of the story. An articulation on the front cover allows you to fold it back and tuck the edge into the metallic clip on the back of the case. The result is a sturdy stand that gives you the option of using your NOOK hands-free in landscape orientation, in either video-viewing mode or typing mode. (The viewing mode offers a more vertical angle.) Proving that this is a smart cover in every sense, it also puts your NOOK HD+ into sleep mode when you close the front flap and wakes it up when the flap is opened. A laser-etched "nook" logo on the back-cover clip adds to the visual appeal of this superior product.

Uphill ride on a cycle: A combination of growing fitness, weight loss and general comfort
There comes a time in every cyclists’ life when he loses his fear of climbing. A time when hills stop becoming objects of dread and are looked forward to as challenges. Once this happens, hills and mountains start to hold a very special place in a cyclist’s life. Climbs are collected like stamps, elevation profiles of rides are discussed and dissected. Cyclists even travel to places just to “conquer” challenging climbs. Mont Ventoux in southern France for example. Or Kalhatti in southern India.
At the beginning, cyclists always focus on distance when evaluating rides, but as they gain experience, talk shifts to elevation gain, unless it is a flat or rolling ride, of course. A cyclist may say: “I climbed 3,000 metres today!” and not even mention horizontal distance.
I still remember fearing climbs in my first years of cycling. This was not only before the legs developed, but before losing too much weight, the pounds being the biggest bugbear when it comes to going up hills. Pro cyclists, who are climbing specialists, weigh a ridiculous 2lb or less per inch of height, which means that for my six feet, I would have to weigh 65kgs or less, more than 10kg lighter than what gets me called “skinny”.
I don’t remember the exact day I lost my fear of hills, but I do remember the transition. It’s a combination of growing fitness, weight loss and general comfort on the bike and one day it all comes together and you find yourself relishing the constant tug of war with gravity. The result is a surge in confidence, because suddenly the road and the world hold no demons. You can point your front tyre and follow it anywhere. You can sign up for rides or tours deemed “challenging”, you can go up hills all morning, fast on your race bike, or slowly on your loaded touring bike, and still be fresh enough at the end of the day to explore or meet friends for dinner.
And best of all, once you’re at the top, you feel you’ve really earned the view. I’ve stood in awe at the brink of many a stunning vista, but the ones that were gained on my bicycle or on foot have been the most precious for they feel as if they were made just for me.
I’ve been thinking about hills a lot because we don’t have much climbing in Bengaluru. Sure, we’re 3,000 feet up, but it’s on a plateau with largely rolling terrain. Our one big climb is Nandi hills, about 60km out of town and a measly 500 metres or so gain over 8km. Every weekend, cyclists from around the city flock to Nandi for their hill training — there’s nowhere else to go. But if you’re willing to make a weekend of it, some of the best climbing of my cycling life is all around Bengaluru in the Nilgiri mountain range. I recently went on a large group-ride through these mountains and was amazed by how good both the scenery and the cycling was. (Cycling after all, is more than the view — it’s a factor of road quality, traffic density and tea and snack stops, among other things.)
I came back to the big city with a new lease of life in the legs, the heart, the head. Some days can be just awful in the city — especially the city that Bengaluru has become. It can be ugly, brutal and poisonous in every sense of the word. Did I say we don’t have much climbing in Bengaluru? I take it back. This city has become a hill that I’m not sure I want to climb.

RE:
The tariff classification of LaserCam NT
Dear Mr. Bowers:
In your letter dated December 11, 2001, on behalf of American Safety (Sun Industries, Inc.), you requested a tariff classification ruling on the LaserCam NT. We returned your request for a classification ruling because additional information was required. In your letter dated February 22, 2002, additional information was supplied. The LaserCam NT software specifications and Operator’s Manual were submitted with your current letter.
The LaserCam NT for which you are requesting a ruling consists of a dual digital image capture device and Laser Gun LTI 20-20 connected to a field computer. You have indicated in your letter that the dual digital image capture device works by monitoring traffic in real video time, and takes two still images simultaneously when the laser gun signals that the vehicle is travelling at or in excess of the pre-set capture speed set into the software. Two digital cameras in tandem are attached to the laser gun. The cameras are joined to the laser gun by coaxial cable and mounted together as one unit. You have stated that the image capture device cannot operate independently of the laser gun. The cameras/laser gun unit is joined to a computer via a coaxial cable. The images captured by the cameras are immediately displayed on the computer screen, along with imbedded data which shows the date and time of the incident, speed zone programmed into the computer by the operator, speed of the vehicle, operator code, site code and infringement number. You have indicated that the camera and computer are reliant on the laser gun, as images will only be recorded and stored if the pre-set capture speed is reached or exceeded.
Classification of merchandise under the Harmonized Tariff Schedule of the United States (HTSUS) is governed by the General Rules of Interpretation (GRIs) taken in order. The LaserCam NT is a composite article that is classifiable under more than one heading, each equally specific. It is the opinion of this office that there is no essential character for this composite article. Accordingly, the combination cameras/laser gun joined to a computer LaserCam NT is classifiable under heading 9031 since it occurs last in numerical order of the competing headings.
The LaserCam NT software specifications and Operator’s Manual are being returned as requested.
The applicable subheading for the LaserCam NT will be
9031.49.90
, Harmonized Tariff Schedule of the United States (HTS), which provides for measuring or checking instruments, appliances and machines, not specified or included elsewhere in this chapter; other optical instruments and appliances; other; other. The rate of duty will be 3.5 percent ad valorem.
You have stated in your letter that the Laser Gun LTI 20-20 is made in the United States., HTSUS, if the Laser Gun LTI 20-20 meets the criteria listed above, the laser gun may be eligible for a duty exemption under subheading
9801.00.10
, HTS031.49.90 - Other optical measuring or checking instruments, appliances and machines, nesoi
Tariff No.: 9801.00.10 - U.S. goods returned without having been advanced in value or improved in condition while abroadPaul Krugman takes issue with the idea that "turning to the welfare state is a dead end." Depends. But an anti-"welfare-state" attitude certainly doesn't make much sense at a time when our economy is getting less, not more, secure.
Face it...
... The traditional accoutrements of a good job — a defined-benefit pension plan, a good health-care plan — have been going away across the board.? ...Paul Krugman, Economics and Politics
There is another side to this. Reading Krugman's post made me think about the era of the most solid of economies, where jobs were many and far more secure than they are now (example: joining IBM in the mid-'60's).
But there were still people who didn't want a lifetime job then, as there are now They were willing to accept some risk in return for more creative, rewarding work. These risk-takers, as we know, often turn out to be significant benefactors of our society. What good was it to keep healthcare, for example, beyond their reach during their leanest times? Or anyone's reach? Did that somehow improve their character, make things better for the rest of us?Phantom OUTTAKES

CHARLOTTE, N.C. — A young girl who was reported missing last week was found Saturday at a fast food restaurant in Charlotte.
According to WBTV, the preteen victim was abducted, driven around for hours, and then held at a hotel by multiple suspects.
The suspects “grabbed” the girl “near her home’ on Thursday afternoon, WBTV reports.
The station reports a security guard spotted the girl in an uptown Burger King near the Transit Center.
“He approached the girl and asked if she was in fact the missing girl,” WBTV reports.
After the security guard contacted Charlotte police, officers notified the victim’s family, the station reports.

It is the government's first big enforcement action related to a credit-rating agency actions in the lead-up to the 2008 crisis. Ahead of the filing late Monday, S& P had said it expected to be charged but denied any wrongdoing and said any lawsuit would be without merit.
So what's the big deal? And what did the bond-analysis shops have to do with the financial crisis?

Pipcu prevails, counterfeiter calamities and now YOU can be a trade mark 'intern' on your smartphone!
With Easter now over, we begin another sacred event: the four day working week. To ease you into it, here is a trio of anti-piracy titbits of news and entertainment.
Pipcu prevails, pirates panic
Pipcu – The City of London Police Intellectual Property Crime Unit – has scored a big hit in the eternal fight against online piracy, having forced a major file-sharing site to shutdown merely by sending it a threatening email, reports the BBC and Torrentfreak. Pipcu, in its own words, is an “operationally independent law enforcement unit dedicated to tackling serious and organised intellectual property crime (counterfeit and piracy) affecting physical and digital goods (with the exception of pharmaceutical goods).” Its focus is on online piracy. It has been running since September 2013, based in the City of London (for those who don’t know this is effectively London’s business centre).
Pipcu has a number of initiatives underway, including its Infringing Websites Lists (or IWL), a blacklist of pirate sites it will share with advertising networks and agencies to discourage them from placing ads on the sites, thus depriving them of their major (if not only) source of revenue. Controversially, the list is not being made public.
It has also been writing angry emails to alleged infringing websites, including The Sports Torrent Network, a popular sports-focused bittorrent tracker providing links to downloads of football (or soccer to the Americans), basketball and Formula 1 events, amongst others. The emails have threatened police action if the sites do not respond although this Kat hasn’t seen the correspondence and so can’t be sure precisely of what offences the sites have been accused. The email sent to The Sports Torrent Network has apparently done the trick without any actual prosecution or even arrest having had to be made – it closed yesterday.
Brand owners baffled at counterfeiter calamities
Counterfeit products are no laughing matter for brand owners. But with thanks to Andrew Digwood for sharing this one, here is an amusing photo list of 30 such products that demonstrate a complete misunderstanding of trade mark law, an ingenious imagination or (in the case of number 20) a desperate need for an educational tour around a zoo. I give you Buzzfeed’s “30 Knockoff Products That Are Almost Better Than The Real Thing”, which includes this gem:
Now YOU can be a trade mark 'intern' on your smartphone!If the long working days of the city trade mark lawyer simply aren’t long enough for you, or your blackberry just won’t flash its evil red eye at you as regularly as you’d like, help is at hand from indie game developer The Men Who Wear Many Hats in the form of the smartphone game “Intern Saga: Trademark Lawyer”. The game is a parody of, amongst other controversies, the trade mark battle over the word CANDY reported earlier in the year by the AmeriKat here. It sees you take on the role of an intern striving to pay off his or her student debt by sending cease and desist requests to developers uploading infringing games to a fictional app store. To give an indication of what the makers think of lawyers, the opening message tells you “This job is so easy a monkey could do it.” If you have an Android phone, find it here. If you have an iPhone, tough luck – Apple refused to approve it without giving much in the way of a reason: “The concept of the app is not the sort of app we want in the app store” Apple is reported to have told the makers.

Color scheme? Blue / YellowExit Polls Confirm Trends among Young Evangelicals
Data Signals Potential Long-Term Shift; Young Evangelicals are Less Conservative, More Pluralistic
New exit poll data, revealing a doubling in young evangelical support for Barack Obama compared to John Kerry, is consistent with recent survey findings that young evangelicals are more pluralistic, less conservative and more supportive of an active government at home and abroad than their elders. Together, these findings signal a potential long-term shift among a new generation of evangelical voters.
â€œYoung evangelicals embrace a broad range of moral concerns — they want to see government power used responsibly to address key national problems, and their heart breaks for those who suffer the most both here and around the world,â€ said Dr. David Gushee, professor of Christian Ethics at Mercer University and author of The Future of Faith in American Politics: The Public Witness of the Evangelical Center. â€œThey disdain ideology, partisanship, polemics, and religious pandering. They want to be known for what they are for and not what they are against.â€
â€œYounger evangelicals’ votes in this election were deposits in an investment account of hope. If President Obama delivers on his promisesâ€”such as seeking real solutions on abortions, abolishing nuclear weapons, ending torture, caring for the poor, and stewardship of creationâ€”then the myth that Christians are a reliable partisan base will vanish in our generation,â€ said Tyler Wigg-Stevenson, Director of the Two Futures Project, a nuclear disarmament initiative centered around young evangelicals. â€œThat would reshape American politics.â€
Released last month by Faith in Public Life, The Faith and American Politics Survey of 2,000 Americans and an over-sample of 1,250 Americans ages 18-34, included both land line and cell phone interviews. The pollâ€™s results, which were analyzed in the report, â€œThe Young and the Faithfulâ€ found:
â€¢ Less than a majority (49%) of younger white evangelicals identify as conservative, compared to nearly two-thirds (65%) of older evangelicals.
â€¢ A majority (56%) of younger white evangelicals believe diplomacy rather than military strength is the best way to ensure peace, compared to only 44% of older white evangelicals.
â€¢ Younger white evangelicals are also more likely than older white evangelicals to favor a bigger government offering more services, by a margin of 21 points (44% and 23% respectively).
â€¢ Younger white evangelicals are strongly opposed to abortion rights, with two-thirds saying abortion should be illegal in all or most cases. Yet only 32% said they would not vote for a candidate who disagreed with them on the issue.
â€¢ A majority of younger white evangelicals favor either same-sex marriage (24%) or civil unions (28%), compared to 61% of older evangelicals who favor no legal recognition of same-sex relationships. They are 2.5 times more likely than older evangelicals to say that gay couples should be allowed to marry (25% to 9%).
â€¢ While less than one-third (30%) of older white evangelicals say a person can be moral without believing in God, 44% of younger evangelicals affirm this idea, a 14-point gap.
Faith in Public Lifeâ€™s Faith and American Politics Survey was conducted by Public Religion Research with interviews performed under the supervision of Opinion Access Corp August 28 – September 19, 2008.NO OPTION AVAILABLE IN THIS ASSET CLASS.

Posted by: sternsquirt

I tend to keep pretty organized garages, but there has to be a better way to store roof racks and accessories when not in use.
I tned to keep two bars mounted on my vann the majority of the time. However, some trips we do require two additional bars with baskets, bike trays, kayak saddles, stackers, etc.
Sometimes we take the wifes Murano, so that rack needs to stored the majority of the time.
SOmetimes we take the F150 so that rack needs to be stored the makority of the time.
I also have the four place receiver mount bike tray, and a motorcycle tray.
I've got a vaque idea in my head of a Thule Wall, think a heavy duty version of tool board. But I really don't have that kindo of wall space to dedicate to racks.
I've got a 9 thule bars, most with feet on them and some with accessories. 4 bike trays, and the 2nd half of the 4 place reciever mount bike tray. (THe main half stays on my van, unless the moto tray is on. (I do use the two together; weled a receiver onto the moto tray to mt the bike carrier, but don't like to keep it there when not in use.
Anybody have pics of good storage methods?

Jenny Howells, Technical Manager at the RORC Rating Office, has put together a brief history of the rating rule, and the Rating Office.My housemates both grew up in suburbs of large cities and I did not. Every once in a while they will comment on how certain ideas/things I do/stories I have "are so country." I am always taken back by these comments like... "oh?.... other people don't do things like this?"
I don't think I've ever had anyone point out my rural upbringings before. This didn't happen in college either because my school was out in the middle of nowhere rural Minnesota. Sure there were a lot of students from the Twin Cities and suburbs, but one didn't have to walk far from campus before they experienced endless fields of corn.
Last night I discovered a new thing that classified me as "so country" and I thought it was utterly bizarre. In the middle of discussing how we were going to spend our weekly community time together the idea of going out to get ice-cream was brought up. We've done this before in the past and in effort to spice up the experience I said enthusiastically,
"Why don't we make homemade ice-cream!" (I thought this was the best idea EVER.)
Instead, Jeremy and Lauren both busted up laughing, too which I replied...
"WHAT!?! Have you NEVER made homemade ice-cream before? I'm not talking about the type where you mix the ice-cream batter and stick it in an ice-cream maker... I'm talking about the grab an empty coffee can and some ice and roll it back and forth forever until it makes ice cream! It's really good!"
They laughed some more and said, "Did you make your own butter too?"
I told them "No!! We didn't have dairy cows!"
Then I discovered they NEVER did this for fun in science class growing up either. What a shame this is! That was a classic part of my childhood. Even in Minnesota we made homemade ice-cream! (Sure it was with the physics department and liquid nitrogen... but still!)
Things you learn.
Anyway, this started me thinking about my own country upbringing and what others mean when they say "That's so country!" As I'm learning it's definitely different culturally from my housemate's upbringing in the suburbs. Tomorrow I plan to post on the some of the things my housemates have commented on this year that make me 'so country,' because really I don't consider myself 'that country' but they seem to think otherwise.
I am definitely looking forward to the post about some of the things that thy have commented on as 'so country' haha. I am from a rural area myself and I often find myself the object of people's good-natured jabs as well!Haskell error reporting with locations
import System.Environment main = do args <- getargs if null args then undefined else undefinedRunning this looks like this:
$ ./H H: Prelude.undefinedWhich undefined caused that? Looking at the error message we have no idea. Wouldn't it be nice with some location information?
We can actually get location information by using Control.Exception.assert:
import Control.Exception(assert) import System.Environment main = do args <- getargs if null args then assert False undefined else assert False undefinedNow running it is much more informative:
$ ./H H: H.hs:7:9-14: Assertion failedHow is assert able to report the location? If we dig deep enough we discover that it's because the ghc compiler contains a special hack to recognize this function and give it location information.
A generalized hackIn a Haskell compiler that I've implemented I've taken this compiler hack and extended it so it can be used for any function. It comes in two parts, location information and location transparent definitions.
__LOCATION__The __LOCATION__ identifier is always defined and utterly magical. Its value is a string that describes the location of that very identifier. This is the very opposite of a referentially transparent name. In fact it's value varies with where it is placed in the code! So it's definitely not for purists. But I'm a practical man, so I sometimes have resort of the ugliness of reality. And in reality we want to report locations in errors.
Enough philosophy, here's an example:
main = do print __LOCATION__ print __LOCATION__And running it prints:
"test/Test.hs:2:11" "test/Test.hs:3:13"And to illustrate the impurity:
main = do let loc = __LOCATION__ print loc print locAnd running this:
"test/Test.mu:2:15" "test/Test.mu:2:15"
Location transparencyThe __LOCATION__ identifier gives the location of itself. This is of little use on its own. Imagine the definition we could give for undefined. Somewhere in the Prelude module it could say something like
undefined = error ("undefined: " ++ __LOCATION__)But if we use this all that it will tell us is where the definition of undefined is, not where it was used.
To get the point of use instead of the definition I've introduced location transparent definitions. In a location transparent definition the __LOCATION__ identifier will not refer to its own position, but to the position of the reference to the definition. Location transparency is introduced with a pragma.
{-# LOCATIONTRANSPARENT undefined #-} undefined = error ("undefined: " ++ __LOCATION__)With this definition our initial example looks like this when we run it:
undefined: test/H.hs:6:9In fact, the real definition of undefined doesn't look like that. The __LOCATION__ identifier is only used in the definition of error, so it looks something like this:
{-# LOCATIONTRANSPARENT error #-} error :: String -> a error s = throw (ErrorCall (__LOCATION__ ++ ": " ++ s)) {-# LOCATIONTRANSPARENT undefined #-} undefined = error "undefined"Since both error and undefined are transparent any use of undefined will be reported with the location of the use.
Furthermore, we can make a few more functions location transparent, e.g.,
{-# LOCATIONTRANSPARENT head #-} head :: [a] -> a head [] = error "Empty list" head (x:xs) = xA simple example:
main = putStr (head [])Which will print:
test/Head.hs:1:16: Empty listwhich is the location where head was called.
ImplementationThere are different ways to implement this feature, and I'm going to sketch two of them.
First: Every function that has the LOCATIONTRANSPARENT pragma will be inlined at the point of use, and the __LOCATION__ identifier in the inlined code will be updated to reflect the call site. The definitions must be processed in a bottom-up fashion for this to work. It's fairly simple to implement, but will cause some code bloat due to inlining.
Second: Every function that has LOCATIONTRANSPARENT pragma will be rewritten (by the compiler) to have an extra location argument, and each use of this function will be rewritten to pass in the current location. For example (using $$f for the location version of f):
main = putStr ($$head __LOCATION__ []) $$head __LOCATION__ [] = $$error __LOCATION__ "Empty list" $$head __LOCATION__ (x:xs) = x $$error __LOCATION__ s = throw (ErrorCall (__LOCATION__ ++ ": " ++ s))This should be fairly straightforward to implement, but I've not tried it. (It's somewhat like dynamic binding, so maybe ghc could reuse that mechanism for locations.)
And, of course, the global __LOCATION__ identifier has to be recognized by the compiler and replaced by a string that is its location.

Effin' brilliant!
If you extend the LOCATIONTRANSPARENT concept all the way up to main() what you wind up with is basically a stack trace, like you'd find in imperative languages.
I've long said that the main drawback of laziness isn't space predictability or performance overheads, but rather the lack of automatic stack traces -- even in production code, with little or no overhead, like Java has.
There have been a lot of proposals for adding stack traces to lazy languages, but IMHO all of them are either unpredictable (they nondeterministically truncate the reported stack trace in some way) or else have serious memory consumption problems that prevent their use in production code (in which case they're really more of a debugger than a stack trace).
Carry on the good fight!
- a
I don't understand how the LOCATIONTRANSPARENT mechanism can assigne blame correctly. For example:
test1 = bar 0
test2 = bar 1
{-# LOCATIONTRANSPARENT bar #-}
bar 0 = error "invalid zero"
bar x = head []
If I understand the proposed extensions correctly, in this example, evaluating test1 leads to an error message that blames test1 for using zero. I think this is correct.
And evaluating test2 leads to an error message that blames test2 for using an empty list. This is clearly wrong, because test2 doesn't even use an empty list. Instead, the blame should be assigned to the second equation of bar. So I think this is wrong.
If we drop the LOCATIONTRANSPARENT pragma, the error location for test2 is better, but the error location for test1 is worse.
How can we assign blame correctly for both test1 and test2?

ReviewsHello! Help me please!
My site nice work on php version 5.2.12, but now php version is changed to 5.2.17 and some code is not working.
It showing error:
"Notice: Undefined variable: newCode in ....../humancheck.php on line 29"
In file humancheck.php on line 29:
for($i=0; $i<$config_max_digits;$i++) $newCode = $newCode.rand(0,9);
This variable, it seems, taken from another file - humancheck_showcode.php:
session_start(); $newCode = $HTTP_SESSION_VARS["newCode"];
And, in index.php file at the beginning of the file written:
require ('human_check/humancheck.php');
And, in index.php file below is written:
<IMG src="humancheck_showcode.php">
When I call the index.php file it shows error.
So, I think, that variable "newCode" should be taken from file humancheck_showcode.php, but it don't do that.2006 Saturn Vue Q&A

Supervised by Mr Heenan, a British Engineer, the palace was later used as the state guest house. The Nawab also held occasional cabinet meetings here and gave audience to notable guests. On some occasions the palace was used as the State Court for the Nawab's address to his courtiers. Noor Mahal was built in the middle of a spacious garden having a water tank and fountains. Thick carpets covered its verandahs and the walls were decorated with paintings, most of them by western artists.
The two-storey palace had exquisite furniture and fixtures like chandeliers and cupboards. There was a rich collection of arms in its armoury.Some swords and muskets were also displayed on the palace walls. A mosque, styled like the one at the Aitchison College, was added to the palace by Nawab Bahawal Khan, a later ruler of the state of Bahawalpur. The palace was completed at a cost of RS. 1.2 million. Repairs half a century later cost Rs. 100,000. The mosque was built at a cost of Rs. 20,000. The property dispute among the heirs of the last ruler resulted in Noor Mahal (as well as several other buildings) being abandoned.
It was locked under a judicial order but not before most of its rich belongings were smuggled out. Its furniture, carpets, paintings and crockery were sold almost all over the country.
Subsequent to the military takeover on Oct 12, 1999, the palace was used as an army club. The army took almost two years restoring some its past glory. It has now been protected under the Antiquities Act of 1975, the latest monument to be so preserved in the Punjab. The notification has, however failed to attract funds for its necessary conservation. The building is still in army's possession. The best use option being weighted for the nineteenth century monument include a hotel, a museum and public park.
JAN 11, 1890: His Highness Prince Albert Victor was there as a guest in Noor Mahal.
DEC 22, 1892: Sir McOrth Beck CCIS Senior Financial Comissioner of Punjab with family stayed at the palace for three days.
MAY 11, 1897: The court was held on the 60th Birthday of the Queen Vicot..

How-To Geek Gets the Microsoft MVP Award, Thanks to You
.
Of course, if you’re familiar with the MVP award you’ll probably know that it’s actually for a single person, but in my opinion the award belongs to the entire How-To Geek community, without which this site would be nothing.
Terrible Photography of the Award
If there’s one thing I’ve learned by receiving this award, it’s that I’m possibly the world’s worst photographer. It took me like 20 minutes just to get this terrible shot—and then I realized that there were fingerprints all over the award itself.
In any case, they send you a little card for your wallet, a pin, an award for the wall, and then the nice piece of glass—once you’ve gotten the award once, you just get the little glass piece for the next year if you win again. The quality of each piece is really impressive, and it’s literally the only thing I’m proud enough to have on the wall of my office.
Once I looked a little closer at the award, I realized something…
That’s right… Microsoft decided that I’m officially a “Windows Expert”. If they knew I was typing this on a MacBook Air, I’m pretty sure they’d take it away from me—nobody tell them! =)
And again, thanks to all of you, the readers who always read every article, leave helpful and constructive feedback, and make this site what it is today.
Well deserved award. Congratulations.
Congratulations Lowell :)
Congrats…..Rock on!!!
Congratulations
Well-deserved, congrats!
You deserve it because of your great blog, just hope you come back to a PC because, appart that you are losing focus on Windows, I also still know ..YOU ARE A PC!

The purpose of the rides was "to test the Supreme Court's ruling in Boynton v. Virginia (1960), which declared segregation in interstate bus and rail stations unconstitutional" (CORE, 2006). In 2001, participants gathered in Jackson, MS to commemorate the fortieth-anniversary of the freedom rides. Of those that attended, forty-two participants were interviewed; those recordings are available in this collection.
In the spring of 2009, the University of Mississippi Libraries' Archives and Special Collections Department in conjunction with the William Winter Institute for Racial Reconciliation and the University of Mississippi Media & Documentary Productions digitized interviews given by those involved in the freedom rides of 1961.
University departments involved with the original production of the oral histories include: the Center for the Study of Southern Culture, the William Winter Institute for Racial Reconciliation, and Media Productions.

this wiki
Théoden rides Snowmane.
Snowmane was the horse of King Théoden.[1]
HistoryEdit
During the Battle of the Pelennor Fields, Snowmane was hit by a black dart and fell onto the king, crushing him, which led to his death. The Witch-king's Fell beast landed upon the body of Snowmane just prior to being slain by Éowyn.[2]
After the battle was over, Snowmane was buried and a stone set up to mark his grave. On the gravestone was written, in the languages of both Gondor and Rohan:
The grass flourished on Snowmane's Howe, as the grave was called, but not on the ground where the Fell beast was burned.[2]
EtymologyEdit
The name Snowmane is the modern English rendition of the Old English name snāw-mana.[3]
Other versions of the legendariumEdit
In an earlier text, King Théoden grieves for the wounded Snowmane. Aragorn later used athelas to tend to the shoulder wound of the horse.[4]

This update fixes many issue and bugs. It also increases the performance by a bit.
A survival RPG aimed at a mix of realism and fantasy, craft, fight, mine, level up and evolve your character! De_Void is a game about surviving on an island that has monsters far more fierce and stronger than you, you must mine, chop and craft weapons and items to fight your way through the island looking for five ancient relics. De_Void is unique from most RPGs because of its wound system, when the player is damaged they will take either sharp or blunt damage, where they will get either a cut or bruise, these can be healed with time. More severe wounds such as gaping wounds and fractures must be healed with bandages or splints and cause things such as blood loss and infections.De_Void also features things such as a day and night system, an experience system, a combat and wounds system, an inventory and much more. The (good) graphics of this game are being made by Purehero, the bad graphics are made by me. Hopefully Purehero can redo all the terrible graphics I have done.
Visit the facebook page @ Facebook.com
Visit the website @ Devoidgame.comxa.com
After thinking, I have figured that I will probably re-make De_Void. I do have some small progress on this re-make already, and it will also not be called De_Void when I begin to do some serious working on it. Here is a screenshot from one of the current test rooms:
As you should be able to see, the new version is now in an over-head view, this will reduce the amount of time required too create new graphics, makes the collision smoother and more realistic and will likely look much better. Instead of firing action icons the player will now actually swing and stab their sword more realistically.
Although the trees are credited too Ravenmonkey of the YoYo Games forums and the grass was made by the very generous Purehero of Minecraft Forums I have succeeded in making my art skills a little bit better, as seen from the sword on the ground, which I made. All the bad graphics from the original De_Void were done by me, hopefully this time the graphics will be much better.
I will attempt to create a more flexible, better looking and more complex inventory that might be able to handle crafting and storage such as chests or bags. The wounds system will be more realistic, but also toned down, you will no longer get cuts or bruises but bleeding and status effects such as sepsis and infections.
De_Void will be both more and less survival at the same time, you will need to stop bleeding with bandages and cure sepsis and infections with antibiotics and herbs but you will also be able to lever up and craft a large selection of weapons and tools, both ranged and melee weapons available.
So basically, I want to re-make and improve De_Void to be better in pretty much everything. And no more blurry, crappy looking graphics because the screen resolution has been increased to 1024x768 in comparison to De_Void's current resolution 640x480. I might even increase it to 1280x768 if I feel it is necessary.
EDIT: (More progress!)
Here is some progress on the new De_Void, which I have decided to call Ethernia, don't ask me what it means, because I don't know. One the coolest features I have implemented is the main menu.
Here is another screenshot of the actual game:
From what you can see, the inventory, health and player have been added, the player sprite is a placeholder until I can be bothered making or finding one (Its the ugly white-blue thing). The Inventory has a description for each item, which is call. A you can not see yet is the new occlusion system, which also stops all npc behaviour once they are too far away, normal De_Void did this, but not as efficiently. I did a stress test with about 200 AI's on the screen at once, and got a nice, stable 60 frames per second.
Here is a screenshot thats shows off some of the status effects (There are more!):
The status effects also have descriptions on mouse-over. The current status effects I have added are bleeding, blood loss, infection, sepsis, fracture and shock. Although the only status effects you see in this shot are bleeding, infection and fracture.
Thats all for now, and if anyone wonders what the weird blue thing is, its good ol' mr slime! Although he is also mainly a placeholder, which I will improve later on, and he can't attack yet, he can only follow and path-find the players position.
This update fixes many issue and bugs. It also increases the performance by a bit.
This new version fixes bugs and various tweaks. The final boss now has battle music and is a bit harder now. I have decided to declare this game finished...
This massive new update is a secret! But it has a TON of new content, and maybe a couple of surprises!
Massive new update adds bangle (armour) system, void rocks, ore, bars and last but not least... VOID TOOLS!!
New version adds steel tools, rewritten weapon HUD, crafting bug fixes, other fixes and tweaks and anything I have forgotten that was changed in this...
New features include a main menu, an improved pause menu. Magic herbs are much more common now, and a vial of life can now be made from 100 magic herbs...Edward Oatman, Rockford, Illinois
Hello,
I am tracing a fellow named Edward Oatman from the Rockford, Illinois area.He was married to a Rose Poland and then divorced.She remarried an Edward LaSage and had several children.
Edward Oatman is believed to have been a furniture salesman and may have been involved in an Arson of the furniture store that he worked at, resulting in his death/suicide in 1938.

Launched in the United States on April 15th, 2013, Modern Farmer was founded by former New York Times journalist and Monocle magazine editor Ann Marie Gardner as a multi-platform media brand for people who have the desire to be closer to – and more educated about – the food on their plates.
“We’re talking about the stories behind the food, not how to cook it,” Gardner said. “Throughout the world, and certainly in the United Kingdom, people today genuinely want to know where their food is coming from, who grows it and how that affects their personal health and the environment. Modern Farmer is the first consumer-focused agriculture brand to lead this conversation and lifestyle choice.”
Since its North American launch in April, the magazine has been praised for its ability to balance tough, thorough food journalism with a visually appealing and warm aesthetic. The Huffington Post reviewed the inaugural issue as “well-written and captivating,” while the Wall Street Journal described Modern Farmer as “Gourmet crossed with Dwell and sent to Green Acres.” The magazine and website have also appeared consistently on the New York Times’ Diners Journal “What We’re Reading List”, and the April 15th issue of TIME magazine called Modern Farmer “A hearty debut!”
Gardner, whose career began at Tatler, before joining the New York Times and later Monocle, began formulating the concept for Modern Farmer in 2011, securing funding in 2012 by partnering with private financial advisory firm Fiore Capital Corporation and its CEO Frank Giustra, a notable philanthropist, founder of Lions Gate Entertainment and co-founder of the Clinton-Giustra Sustainable Growth Initiative. Giustra commented, “We are very excited about backing Modern Farmer’s development and launch. The time is right for a new, dedicated global media brand that will connect people to news about the food that they eat, explore what’s happening on the farm and celebrate the people who are leading the way raising awareness of agricultural and food issues facing us.”
Modern Farmer magazine consists of four quarterly print issues, as well as a companion website () and an expansive online marketplace containing news and products focused on a range of contemporary farming topics. The premiere issue includes articles focused on the overpopulation of wild pigs, the modern seed economy and the Malawi mango business and how it is tied to the popularity of McDonald’s smoothies. Articles geared to the more novice and urban farmer, such as “How to Pick A Backyard Chicken” and the concept of “rurbanista” design round out the issue’s content.
Featuring internationally recognized journalists and editors, current contributors to Modern Farmer magazine and ModernFarmer.com come from such publications as the New York Times, Mother Jones, Monocle, the Telegraph, Buzzfeed, Wall Street Journal, Financial Times,Village Voice, NPR, Wired, Dwell, Cook’s Illustrated and Slate. The editorial staff includes Reyhan Harmanci, Andy Wright, Sarah Gephart, Luise Stauss, Jake Swearingen, Jesse Hirsch and Molly Birnbaum.
Each issue of Modern Farmer will be priced at £5.95. To purchase a subscription, visit the Modern Farmer website at. In the United Kingdom, individual issues may be purchased online at Newsstand UK. For more information visit newsstand.co.uk.

Posted on: Mon, 07/01/2013 - 5:04pm
It has more to do with the C.B.A. and luxury tax
Teams don't want to pay double on the luxury tax. Within 2 years the players will be cursing the agreement they signed. Too many players will be forced to take minimum deals after "Rose Rule" guys and max deals get their money. 75% of the league will be on minimums.
This may finally be the year that GMs refuse to pay big money to above average players who ultimately make little to no difference in the win column. Guys like Monta Ellis, OJ Mayo, JR Smith, Darren Collison, etc are in for a rude awakening because most of the 8 or so teams that can win a title either have no cap space, no minutes for them, or no deserve to add selfish players to the mix. Also the rebuilding teams are all in no rush to be good next year because of the 2014 draft class coming up. Add to that the free agents available next summer and it's a perfect recipe for teams making a stand and not over paying.Thanks for visiting

Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center announced a major partnership Tuesday with Hartford Healthcare Medical Group. Hartford Healthcare will be the first member of Memorial Sloan-Kettering's new Cancer Alliance. The alliance will bring the expertise of MSK's physicians and research team to oncology providers in the Hartford Healthcare system.
Dr. Craig Thompson, President and CEO of Memorial Sloan-Kettering, says the alliance is in part a response to a recent report by the Institute of Medicine that described the delivery of high quality cancer care a "national crisis." "At MSK, we've been looking for novel ways to address this crisis," said Dr. Thompson. "The MSK alliance with Hartford Healthcare is an enormously positive step in that direction."
Physicians and administration from both organizations will collaborate on cancer care and clinical research programs. MSK's Dr. Jose Baselga says this partnership means Connecticut cancer patients will now have access to MSK's many ongoing clinical trials.
Officials from both Hartford Healthcare and Memorial Sloan-Kettering say they will spend the next six months assessing the resources and capabilities of both institutions, and integrating Hartford physicians into MSK's disease management teams.Canadian Nurses Association installs 46th president: Dr. Karima Velji, RN, CHE, of Toronto, Ontario
WINNIPEG, June 18, 2014 /CNW/ - Dr. Karima Velji, RN, CHE, was officially installed as the 46th president of the Canadian Nurses Association (CNA) during today's closing ceremonies at its highly successful biennial convention in Winnipeg. As president, she will represent 151,404 registered nurse (RN) members across Canada.
"As the national representative for the registered nursing profession, I will be guided by the principles of engagement and accountability," said Velji. "It is so important to unleash the power of registered nurses and to demonstrate the impact of the care we provide. I want to inspire my fellow nurses to realize the powerful difference we are making in the lives of those we serve, so we can safeguard the exceptional trust Canadians place in us."
Velji is a health-care executive with more than 25 years of progressive leadership experience spanning the full continuum of care. Her expertise is in the development and implementation of innovative models of care, interprofessional practice and quality/safety systems. She has consulted with the Ministry of Health and Long-Term Care in Ontario and with Toronto's Central Local Health Integration Network. A peer-funded scholar, awards recipient and sought-after speaker, Velji is also the newly-appointed vice chair of Accreditation Canada's board of directors. Most recently, she was the chief operating officer and chief nursing executive at Baycrest, a global leader in innovations on aging and brain health, and was vice-president of patient care and chief nursing executive at the Toronto Rehabilitation Institute, now a program in the University Health Network.
The change of command comes as CNA concludes its annual meeting and biennial convention. CNA's presidents are elected to the volunteer position by CNA's voting membership. Velji spent the past two years as president-elect and receives the chain of office from outgoing president Dr. Barb Mildon. Mildon is currently vice-president of professional practice and research and chief nurse executive at the Ontario Shores Centre for Mental Health Sciences. CNA's new president-elect is Barbara Shellian.
CNA is the national professional voice of registered nurses in Canada. A federation of 11 provincial and territorial nursing associations and colleges representing 151,404 registered nurses, CNA advances the practice and profession of nursing to improve health outcomes and strengthen Canada's publicly funded, not-for-profit health system.

In a stroke of subtle PR genius, Team Noem struck back against the Dems who have sought to paint her as a no-show/no-talk member of Congress.
In the press release announcing the House Ag Committee’s passage of a farm bill, Rep. Kristi Noem’s press shop included 3 – count ’em, 3 – links to video of her talking during hearings on the bill.
As part of the MDR’s friendly service, we bring them to you here:
The downside could be that the clips are short – about 3 minutes total – leaving room for her critics to say, well, you know, she didn’t talk that much. Plus, she has said that South Dakotans didn’t send her to Washington to talk. But her critics could argue that in these clips she is talking just to talk.Or so it seems to me.
Ultimately, though, in our workaday world, voters will see these clips flitting past on the evening news and dismiss the claims that she hasn’t shown up as Election Year mudslinging. And they’ll mostly be right. Or so it seems to me.
Noem is not impressive. She only does what gets her media attention. The idea that she did anything at all for the farm bill is silly.
I’ll vote against Noem as soon as I have a better option. Right now I don’t. Varilek does not bring a winning message to the table.
Varilek will go away after 2012. Hopefully Noem goes away after ’14.
Oh the democrats saw I wasn’t doing my job and called me out on it. I’ll show them and talk for a while in the farm hearing. Noem is so unimpressive I can’t even find the words. She is self serving and self promoting.
Look at her facebook page and John Thune’s. Thune talks about real issues and what is going on in DC. Noem posts pictures of herself or her kids. Give me a break. Thune, Rounds and Daugaard are the real deal and Noem is a poser who doesn’t do or talk about anything substantial.
Noem is a let down for conservatives like me who expected something better out of her.
Denise do you remember if Mike Rounds endorsed John Thune in 2004? I seem to remember him getting Rounds’ endorsement but I can’t find it anywhere.
Apolitical, I wish I could remember that. I don’t. I can’t imagine that not being the case, but one never knows about these things. I’ll ask somebody who might know and get back to you.August 2, 2012
Prairie Girl Bakery is a quick 5 minute walk away from the heart of the Financial District in Downtown Toronto. (a.k.a, a perfect snack break)
The menu is relatively simple; they stick to the core classic flavours and add a new spin on other flavours like Peanut Butter and Jam and Salted Caramel (this week).
Package of 6 minis goes for $9.95
Salted Caramel
The cupcake was moist, but a little bit sticky to eat. The ideal bite size snack.
The icing was sweet and decadent and stayed true to the salted caramel flavour. Proportion wise, the buttercream icing was heavier than the cupcake. But that's great news for icing fans!
Joe Prairie's Red Velvet Cupcake with Chocolate Cream Cheese icing and a swirl of Vanilla icing.
I didn't really taste the cream cheese icing in the chocolate, rather I thought it was chocolate buttercream icing with a swirl of cream cheese icing on top. It was a really sweet combination.
Overall: Prairie Girl Cupcakes are perfect sized morsels of sweetness. Their menu has simple classic cupcake flavours and they're done well.
August 20, 2012
Another cupcake run
From the top left: Hazelnut, Root beer float, Chocolate Strawberry, Vanilla Lemon, Red Velvet Cream Cheese, Chocolate Peanut Butter.
My favourite cupcake was the Root Beer float cupcake because it was so different, interesting and delicious! It was exactly how root beer and vanilla ice cream would taste like and in cupcake form - it really doesn't get any better than that.
I also enjoyed the real strawberry icing on the chocolate strawberry cupcake and the Vanilla lemon was a delicious blend of tangy sweetness (not sour at all).
I wasn't as big a fan of the Red Velvet Cream Cheese, Chocolate Peanut Butter or Hazelnut. The cream cheese icing on the red velvet was nice, but not particularly outstanding; the chocolate peanut butter icing was smooth and creamy like peanut butter (but I wasn't a fan of that combination - except maybe for Reeses Peanut Butter cups) and the Hazelnut was relatively plain and simple compared to the other flavours.
June 13, 2013
I love pistachios in desserts (try searching my blog for "pistachio", there's a ton of results).
So I couldn't wait for Prairie Girl Bakery's featured flavour to be pistachio. Yay!
Black Forest and Pistachio Mini cupcakes
The pistachio was really good! Vanilla cupcake base with pistachio buttercream and topped with two small pistachio nuts. It had the rich nutty flavour in sugar form - delicious!
The black forest was a chocolate based cake with cherry and vanilla icing topped with chocolate sprinkles. It was okay overall.Website:

To read the transcripts for this quest, see the Breaking Barriers Spoilers page.
This mission is part of the San d'Oria nation mission series. The complete series includes:
For prep work, we didn't use any items and I buffed with a Couerl Sub, switched to my Engetsuto (capped Polearm, albeit unmerrited) and summoned my lvl 70 Soothing Healer NPC. Plan was to have the WHM pop the birds, I'd voke Suparna while she'd repose the fledgling and it worked perfectly.
Penta Thrusts tear these birdies apart with my high clocking in at 1431. Suparna does hit a bit hard, but it's nothing a little bit of Third Eye and Cure bombing from the NPC and WHM couldn't handle. The WHM cast Repose on the fledgling again after Suparna went down so we could rest up, and after getting to near full MP and HP we took down the second as quickly as we were able to.
I've read that the birds are either immune or extremely resistant to dark-based sleeps and lullaby, but a 68 WHM with capped Divine Magic had no trouble getting Repose to stick.
For a greater economy shall follow us and it will be outdone. And a greater autonomy shall follow us and it too will be outdone. And a greater feeling shall follow Love and it too we will blow to dust.
Retired. For reals this time.

My friend (Taycee 60whm/blm) and I (75smn/whm) went to do this fight together. She wasn't on the mission, but she offered to help me out. I really just wanted to see if I could make a dent in either of these guys solo. I expected to die.
We got up there and took care of Ahtu (quest NM). I used a marron glace, rr2, stoneskin, blink, etc.
I popped the birds and we ran for the zone, zoned in and reapplied blink. I zoned back out, put up sneak and summoned Fenrir. I stuck Fenrir on the BRD bird, used Eclipse Bite, and ran to the other side. Taycee confirmed they did not link, but the second bird was standing quite away from the first so, I can't be sure they don't in another situation.
During this initial fight with Fenrir, the WHM bird despawned.
From there on out it was a matter of keeping stoneskin up and Carby/Fenrir kiting the bird across the area. I used Carby most of the time, but occasionally pulled in Fenrir to do an Eclipse Bite for extra damage. Eclipse Bite was hitting for around 300-450 area. I was very careful with this move because naturally I was getting all this extra hate and kept getting hit. One hit went straight through my stoneskin many times and damaged me. But one hit is usually all it took before one of my pets grabbed hate back.
There was one point that I almost died. Carby went after the bird and missed on the first try and the bird kept hitting me. I was deep in the red below 50hp. Taycee saved me by giving me a DS+Cure IV. She took hate and took the death. In this time Carby got some hits in and resumed hate after the bird took Taycee down. This action on Taycee's part saved the entire fight really.
Right as Taycee died, I was slept by the BRD AOE. But Carby did have hate, so all I did was stand there and wait for sleep to wear off. It took about 60% of Carby's life bar before I woke up naturally. This moment was also a moment where things could have ended fast. I was lucky here to have woken up so fast.
After that point, I kited with Carby only as the bird had only about 5% life left. Taycee RR'd and cured me as needed. It only took a few more kites to take the bird down.
It was a hard fight, pets died very fast. Taycee healed me at each end of the kite. And with the exception to that one point, the fight went really well and smooth. I don't know if we got lucky, but I'm just overjoyed it worked out!
Special Thanks to Taycee, a great friend IRL and IG.

For this, I subbed /rdm for sneak and invis to save on oils and powders. Got Valley of Sorrows, no prob. Teleported to Vahzal and got Xarcabard. Took all of 5 minutes. Fire suggested that we go see just how hard the NM's were. They Teleported to Holla while I warped to Jeuno to change into /war and grab some yag drinks. We met up at The Eldieme Necropolis and got to the island. (Gotta love almost no aggro at 69 :p)
Found the NM tree for the Sandi quest there. Killed it without any dmg to anyone, and Meow got the drop. We buffed up, all put up RR, and ate our food. (I used a carbonara I had left over from my Maat fight) Fire put sneak up and popped the NM's. He ran back and we all zoned into Eldieme. Being a Taru bst, Fire took a ton of dmg, even with Stoneskin and Blink up, which Meow healed. We headed back outside and she took a knee to get her MP back. Suparna was standing close to the zone, while the Fledgling was near the ledge. Once Meow was ready, Fire called his Carrie and went to pull the closest bird, only to have them both despawn. >.< We took too long to med.
I decided, as Galka pld, to try and spawn them this time. Fire snuck me, and I popped them. Ran to the zone, only taking about 150 dmg. Waited 5, then rezoned. They were in the same places. Fire called another Carrie and pulled the Suparna to the zone. I immediately provoke/flash and engage. With the def of the carbonara, I was taking 60-70 dmg, with up to 200 on crits. I popped Rampart and most of his AoE spells were being blocked for 0. Then I popped Sentinel and the dmg dipped to 20-30 with crits of 80-100. (Gotta love the new updates) Anyway, we killed it in short order, and looked over to see that the Fledgling had despawned during the fight. We walked over to the ??? and got the cutscene. Amazingly simple, to be quite honest. Now, just one more mission for Rank 10. wOOt!

First, I popped the 2 birds by clicking the ???. Then I zoned. When I re-entered, they were still there, going back to the ???. So I pulled Suparna with gravity. Once it got away from the other bird, I bound it and casted Poison II + Bio II.
I tried to silence it but it didn't stick, so I didn't bother casting it again.
BTW, these can't be slept.
From there I just waited till it died, recasted Bind and Gravity when it wore off (Had haste on all the time). It managed to lullaby me once in a while, but I woke up before bind wore off.
I did get in a sticky suitation where bind wore off and it lullaby'd me before I could recast it, it then attacked me 2 times (200 dmg each hit), managed to cast bind, hit me again, then got out of range before it could attack me again (did a total of 600 dmg to me.)
I subbed /NIN so shadows would eat Massacre Elegy and take a few hits when bind and gravity wore off at the same time.
Just kept Poison II + Bio II on it and it died!
Didn't see it 2hr though...
EDIT: Oh yeah! The other bird disappeared after awhile, so I clicked on the ??? again once I defeated the Suparna and got CS! So it seems you only have to fight one bird (Dunno if it has the be the Suparna)!

Those instructions tell you to go north, which is a LIE...it's EAST.
It took me 4 deaths to try out different methods. Here how it went down (god bless RR gorget).
#1: Planned this as a dry run for myself. Tried Sleep2 on whm NM, but it was resisted. The BRD did 2 magic finale that took SS off, and I was pecked to death. I noted that the brd was doing 200 damage, and the whm is only doing 80. (I had P4, and phalanx on still)
#2: Tried to sleep brd NM this time. It was also resisted. The BRD NM slept me, and again, it was a quick death for me.
#3: This time I tried gravity. It stuck alright, but both NM (yes BOTH) were spamming Horde Lullaby on me. I had no chance.
#4: I full buff, and put barsleep and barfire on last. I also sneak/deodorize. I popped them, and they were pecking right away. Then I remember peyton is sight aggro anyways, so that was a dumb attempt for a sneak pop. I kinda gave up, but I casted all my debuff, and noticed that all of them landed.
#5: Again, I full buff with barsleep/barfire. This time, right after I pop them, I just dash to zone, not stopping for anything. I made it into EN only taking 2 hits. I put SS and shadow back on, and zone right back. NM was still there, and I pull the WHM NM with a Poison II. As the WHM walks past the BRD, they did not link. So now, it's just me against the whm. o.o
Silence is the most important debuff here. This "whm" NM also does songs, so make sure silence is in place. Otherwise, it's just like fighting avatars, except every debuff I threw at it landed. I had to convert once during this battle. It didn't take long either that long either.
The BRD NM despawned during the my fight with the WHM. After the WHM was dead, I clicked on the ???, and got the last key item.

I shadowbinded the brd, this leaving the whm...
We zoned , returned i graped the bird, fenir tanked we killed him, the other depoped but the key item was still givin....
Cool fight, was kinda hard, only cause i would take hate from fenir..the smn did have to recast fenir once, no prob tho
First of all, the RDM could easily kite the Fledgling because I had no problems sticking Gravity. However, to be safe and since this post was talking about parties of 75, we decided to follow the zone method mentioned:
Everyone stayed inside Eldieme except for myself and the WHM. I buffed and then popped the NMs, Gravitied the Fledgling, then ran to the zone. The WHM stayed out and ahead of me to heal me in case of sleep so I wouldn't have to drop Stoneskin.
We all zoned out right after and then the SAM pulled the Suparna which was just outside the zone and we fought it easily, then took on the Fledgling, which was still far back by the ???. They both 2-houred, but the battles were so easy, it wasn't an issue.

He spawned and zoned, making it to the zone line with just a little over 100 HP left in spite of starting off with Stoneskin, Phalanx, and Blink. I watched as the two birds walked back toward the headstone and got far enough apart for the WAR/BRD to be pulled. Yes he used Mighty Strikes, and yes he put me to sleep with Lullabye. Weather Bard is his sub or he's one of those lucky mobs who simply has two jobs, I can't say as he didn't Soul Voice.
Anyway, after the Lullabye incident, I made sure to keep him silenced. The other RDM kept Gravity up, and we nuked him then slept him once. Two Blizzard IIIs took out maybe an 8th of his life, so we decided to Chainspell nuke when he woke up. We did. He burned. That many Fire and Blizzard IIIs in a row is a thing of beauty.
Unfortunately, he still had a sliver of life left when we both ran out of mp. I ran toward the zone as my Stoneskin had fallen and the other RDM had no way to take hate. When Refresh finally brought my MP back up so that I could cast Drain, I did and the bird dropped. The smaller bird did not have to be killed.
Anyway, this mission is officially doable by a lv. 73 and 74 RDM combo.
When u all have dropped down, follow the path to the Batilla Downs exit. Now you are on the island. Locate the '???' closest to the Stone Monument. When you are ready to fight have a NIN or someone with NIN sub kite one of the birds around while the party kills the other. Then once it is dead, simply all attack the other. Once it is dead, go back to the '???' for a cutscene.
After completing the second step (by clicking on the ??? at H-7 -- turn left at top of ramp up to upper level and it is between 3 trees) you obtain the key item: Figure of Garuda.

First off, if you have plans to do this mission, PLEASE activate it and go do the solo stuff as soon as you can. It takes an hour and you're ready for Batallia. I formed a nice alliance today and over the course of it we realized that 6 of the 15 people didn't have the solos done, and one person didn't even have the mission active. This made 9 people (including 3 people who were not doing the mission but just helping) to wait for nearly TWO HOURS as the other people went to get the mission and get the key items. Make sure you go to Valley of Sorrows first and Xarcabard second; you can't do them out of order.
The pull/zone technique worked perfectly for us.

Daniel L. Toomey, Jerome T. Flynn (Argued), Indiana Federal Community Defenders, Inc., Hammond, IN, for Defendant-Appellant.
Before EASTERBROOK, RIPPLE and MANION, Circuit Judges.
RIPPLE, Circuit Judge.
A jury convicted James C. Hendricks of being a felon in possession of a firearm in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 922(g)(1). The district court sentenced Mr. Hendricks to 188 months' imprisonment as an armed career criminal. See 18 U.S.C. § 924(e); U.S.S.G. § 4B1.4. Mr. Hendricks challenges both his conviction and his sentence. For the reasons set forth in the following opinion, we affirm the judgment of the district court.
* BACKGROUND
A. Factual Background
At 5:42 a.m. on May 10, 2001, Millie McDonald, a newspaper carrier, called the Lowell, Indiana Police Department to report what she perceived to be suspicious activity. After furnishing her name and occupation, McDonald informed the police dispatcher that an occupied white car was parked behind the Oil Exchange on Route 2. That business was closed at that hour of the morning. McDonald stated that she initially had observed the car parked behind the Oil Exchange facing east, that she had continued on her paper route, and that she had returned sometime later to find the same vehicle still parked behind the Oil Exchange, but this time facing west. The dispatcher immediately relayed McDonald's information to Officer John Swisher, who was present at the police station when the call was received.
Because the police station and the Oil Exchange are located within the same block on Route 2, Officer Swisher was able to respond to the call immediately. As Officer Swisher was leaving the police station, he observed a white car drive from behind the Oil Exchange, turn right onto Route 2, and then make a sharp right turn into a Mobile gas station. Officer Swisher observed that the white car failed to make a complete stop before pulling onto Route 2 and did not use a turn signal when leaving the Oil Exchange or entering the gas station. He also observed two occupants in the car and noticed that the passenger was moving about. The driver of the car was Marlissa Barnes and the only passenger was her fiancé, Mr. Hendricks.
Without activating his patrol car's emergency lights, Officer Swisher followed Barnes into the Mobile station and stopped his patrol car approximately fifteen feet behind where she had stopped her vehicle. There was nothing in front of the white car to prevent its exit. By the time Officer Swisher pulled into the Mobile station and stopped his car, Barnes had stopped, was out of the car and was rapidly approaching Officer Swisher's patrol car. Officer Swisher testified that it was unusual for a driver to approach him in such a manner. He further testified that his suspicions were elevated because her car had been parked behind a closed business establishment and there had been quite a few burglaries in the area during that time. For these reasons, Officer Swisher radioed for back-up.
Before a back-up officer arrived, Barnes engaged Officer Swisher in conversation. She told Officer Swisher that she was lost and looking for the interstate. When Officer Swisher asked her why she had been parked behind the closed Oil Exchange, Barnes avoided the question; she continued to state that she was lost and looking for the interstate. According to Officer Swisher, Barnes appeared nervous, her hands were shaking, and she kept looking back at her car as if something were wrong. Officer Swisher also noticed that Mr. Hendricks continued to move about the passenger side of the car and that Barnes was attempting to obstruct his view of Mr. Hendricks by repeatedly moving into his line of sight.
About a minute into Officer Swisher's conversation with Barnes, Officer Jeff Burk arrived at the Mobile station; the emergency lights of his patrol car were activated. Once Officer Burk arrived, Officer Swisher decided to approach the white car. As he approached, Officer Swisher noticed that Mr. Hendricks was slumped down in the passenger seat so that his head was barely visible from the rear of the car. He further noticed that the lock on the passenger door was completely missing; it had been "spun off." Suppression Hearing at 56. Officer Swisher testified that this condition indicated a forced entry. Upon reaching Mr. Hendricks, Officer Swisher asked him if he could see some identification. At this point, Officer Swisher noticed that the key in the ignition was turned upside down and that the key was barely stuck into the ignition lock; he also noticed that wires and broken plastic were hanging from the steering column. Officer Swisher testified that these observations indicated to him that the vehicle had been stolen.
Mr. Hendricks told Officer Swisher that he had identification, but he did not produce it; instead, he kept reaching for something on the left side of his body in the seat. Because it appeared to Officer Swisher that Mr. Hendricks was having difficulty with something that the officer could not see, he became concerned for his safety and asked Mr. Hendricks to get out of the car. Officer Swisher then conducted a protective pat-down search of Mr. Hendricks' outer clothing and felt a metal object in the right pocket of his pants. From prior experience, the officer recognized the object as the magazine for a handgun. Having ascertained that the magazine was full, Officer Swisher asked Mr. Hendricks where the gun was and whether he had a permit. Mr. Hendricks did not tell Officer Swisher where the gun was, but he responded that he did not have a permit. Officer Swisher then handcuffed Mr. Hendricks for officer safety. While the car door was still open, Officer Swisher observed a fully loaded Lorcin nine-millimeter handgun on the floor-board but partially hidden beneath the passenger seat. The magazine in Mr. Hendricks' pocket fit this weapon.
Mr. Hendricks was placed under arrest. At the police station, Officer Swisher performed a more thorough pat-down of Hendricks; during this search, in the same pocket in which he previously had found the loaded magazine, the officer found a single loose bullet that matched the bullets in the magazine found in Hendricks' pocket and the bullets in the magazine recovered from the handgun. No fingerprints were recovered.
Both Mr. Hendricks and Barnes testified at trial. Barnes testified that, although she had pleaded guilty to auto theft in state court, she had not stolen the car, but rather had taken the car from a friend after it had been stolen. According to Barnes, she drove the stolen car from a party to her home in Gary sometime after 2:00 a.m. on the morning of May 10, 2001. She left the car running outside her home while she went inside to find Mr. Hendricks. At that point, Barnes and Mr. Hendricks began arguing, and Barnes went back to the stolen car. Mr. Hendricks followed her and positioned himself in the passenger seat. The two continued to argue, and Barnes drove off. She drove aimlessly until they ended up in Lowell.
Both Mr. Hendricks and Barnes testified that they did not know the handgun was in the car until they were in Lowell. However, ATF Special Agent David Coulson testified that, on the morning of May 10, Barnes told him that she and Mr. Hendricks were aware of the gun's presence in the car while they were in Gary. Mr. Hendricks and Barnes both admitted that, once Mr. Hendricks found the gun, which they testified was under the passenger seat, he held it in his hand. Mr. Hendricks testified that he had reached under the seat, found the handgun, picked it up and started screaming at Barnes for having a firearm in the car. He further testified that Barnes grabbed the gun, that he took the gun back from Barnes, and that he placed it under the passenger seat. Mr. Hendricks testified that, shortly after placing the gun under the passenger seat, he got out of the car and used a pay phone that was located next to the Mobile station. According to Mr. Hendricks, he attempted to call his aunt to see if she could pick him up, but the aunt did not answer the phone. Mr. Hendricks testified that a few minutes went by, that he observed a police vehicle, and that he then decided to get back into the car.
B. District Court Proceedings
During trial, Mr. Hendricks objected to the district court's instruction on possession and submitted instructions on two theories of defense. The district court gave its own instruction over Mr. Hendricks' objection and refused to give either of Mr. Hendricks' instructions in its charge to the jury. On March 26, 2002, the jury convicted Mr. Hendricks of being a felon in possession of a firearm in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 922(g)(1). On June 11, 2002, Mr. Hendricks was sentenced by the district court. Mr. Hendricks objected to a 2 level enhancement of his offense level for obstruction of justice and also a 2 level enhancement for an obliterated or altered firearm serial number. The district court denied Mr. Hendricks' objections and granted both of the enhancements. Mr. Hendricks also objected to the court's application of the Armed Career Criminal Act, 18 U.S.C. § 924(e), without having the issue presented to the jury. The district court denied Mr. Hendricks' objection and sentenced him as an armed career criminal under U.S.S.G. § 4B1.4. The court also denied Mr. Hendricks' request for a 3 level reduction for acceptance of responsibility. Mr. Hendricks was sentenced to a term of 188 months in prison.
II
DISCUSSION
A. Fourth Amendment Challenge
Mr. Hendricks filed a motion to suppress the nine-millimeter handgun retrieved from the stolen car. Following a hearing, the district court denied the motion. The court determined that "there was no initial stop of the vehicle" and that subsequent events certainly gave Officer Swisher reasonable suspicion to conduct an investigatory stop. Continued Suppression Hearing at 48. Mr. Hendricks submits that the district court erred when it denied his motion to suppress. In reviewing a district court's decision on a motion to suppress, we review questions of fact for clear error and questions of law de novo. See United States v. Jackson, 300 F.3d 740, 745 (7th Cir.2002).
Mr. Hendricks submits that, although the car already was parked at the Mobile station when Officer Swisher arrived, the car was "stopped" when Officer Swisher pulled in fifteen feet behind the parked car. Mr. Hendricks further contends that this stop violated the Fourth Amendment because it was not supported by reasonable suspicion. We cannot accept either of these contentions. We believe that the district court correctly determined that the initial encounter between Officer Swisher and the car's occupants was consensual and that no stop occurred until Officer Burk arrived at the Mobile station with his emergency lights activated. We also believe that, in any event, Officer Swisher had reasonable suspicion to make an investigatory stop as soon as he observed the white car pull out from behind the closed Oil Exchange. We shall address each of these issues.
1.
We believe that the district court correctly determined that no stop occurred within the meaning of the Fourth Amendment until Officer Burk arrived at the scene because, until that time, the encounter between Officer Swisher and the car's occupants was consensual. See Schneckloth v. Bustamonte, 412 U.S. 218, 248, 93 S.Ct. 2041, 36 L.Ed.2d 854 (1973).
It goes without saying that ")). Accordingly, "[l]aw enforcement officers do not violate the Fourth Amendment's prohibition of unreasonable seizures merely by approaching individuals on the street or in other public places and putting questions to them if they are willing to listen." United States v. Drayton, 536 U.S. 194, 122 S.Ct. 2105, 2110, 153 L.Ed.2d 242 (2002). "Even when law enforcement officers have no basis for suspecting a particular individual, they may pose questions, ask for identification, and request consent to search luggage — provided they do not induce cooperation by coercive means." Id. The test is whether "a reasonable person would feel free to terminate the encounter." Id. In making this determination, relevant factors include "`the threatening presence of several officers, the display of a weapon by an officer, some physical touching of the person of the citizen, or the use of language or tone of voice indicating that compliance with the officer's request might be compelled."' United States v. Packer, 15 F.3d 654, 657 (7th Cir.1994) (quoting United States v. Mendenhall, 446 U.S. 544, 554-55, 100 S.Ct. 1870, 64 L.Ed.2d 497 (1980)).
Consistent with the foregoing standard, this court has recognized that "in some circumstances a driver may stop his automobile on his own resulting in a consensual encounter." United States v. Green, 111 F.3d 515, 520 n. 1 (7th Cir.1997) (citing United States v. Langston, 970 F.2d 692, 697-98 n. 3 (10th Cir.1992) (finding a consensual encounter where a driver pulled over after an officer drove up alongside him and made eye contact, and the officer turned on his emergency lights for the first time after he parked on the shoulder)). However, this court consistently has held that an encounter is not consensual when a reasonable person would not feel free to leave. For this reason, the court in Packer held that police intervention amounted to a stop when the officers parked their vehicles both in front and behind the defendant's car with the "take down" light shining through the defendant's windows and an officer asked the occupants to put their hands in the air as she approached the car with a flashlight. See Packer, 15 F.3d at 657. Similarly, in Green, the court held that a stop had occurred when the officers pulled their car across the driveway and blocked the defendant's exit because a reasonable person would not have felt free to leave. See Green, 111 F.3d at 520 n. 1.
This court's discussion in United States v. Pavelski, 789 F.2d 485 (7th Cir.1986), upon which both Mr. Hendricks and the Government rely in support of their respective positions, further illustrates the distinction between a consensual encounter and a stop. In Pavelski, a police officer was following the defendants' car looking for a reason to stop the car when the defendants voluntarily pulled into a small parking lot slightly removed from the public road. The officer, without any suspicion that the defendants had violated any laws, parked his patrol car behind the defendants' car, and a second officer parked his patrol car along the side of the defendants' car. The driver exited the car and walked to the front bumper. The officer then approached the driver and began asking him questions. During this conversation, a third officer drove up and parked his patrol car twenty to thirty feet in front of the defendants' car. At this point, the officer stepped back to the rear passenger door, tapped on the window and began questioning the car's passengers.
Based on these facts, this court determined that a seizure did not occur until the third patrol vehicle parked in front of the defendants' car because until that time, "the circumstances could not have caused a reasonable person to feel restrained." Id. at 488. The court explained that prior to the third officer's arrival, the driver "could have declined to answer the questions and driven away the car and its passengers." Id. Once the third officer parked his vehicle in front of the defendants' car, however, the consensual encounter became an investigatory stop because "[a] reasonable person in this situation, bounded on three sides by police patrol cars, would not have believed that he was free to leave." Id.1
The district court's determination in this case certainly was consistent with this case law. The district court's conclusion that the initial stop was consensual is firmly grounded in the record and reflects an accurate understanding of the applicable standard. The court was on solid ground in determining that Officer Swisher did not effectuate a stop when he parked his patrol car fifteen feet behind the stolen car. Barnes drove to the Mobile station and parked the car out of her own free will. Officer Swisher did not signal the car to pull over. When Barnes pulled into the gas station, Officer Swisher was approximately fifty feet behind the car. Although Officer Swisher followed the car into the Mobile station and stopped approximately fifteen feet behind it, there was nothing in front of the car to block its exit from the gas station. Officer Swisher did not activate his emergency lights when Barnes pulled into the gas station, nor did he shine a light on the car. By the time that Officer Swisher had pulled into the Mobile station and stopped his patrol car, Barnes had parked, was out of the car and was rapidly approaching Officer Swisher. Based on these facts, the district court properly determined that Officer Swisher's initial encounter with the occupants of the stolen car was not a seizure within the meaning of the Fourth Amendment; a reasonable person in these circumstances would not have felt restrained.
2.
In Terry v. Ohio, 392 U.S. 1, 30, 88 S.Ct. 1868, 20 L.Ed.2d 889 (1968), the Supreme Court held that an officer may, consistent with the Fourth Amendment, conduct a brief, investigatory stop if the officer has a reasonable suspicion supported by articulable facts that "criminal activity may be afoot." "Although an officer's reliance on a mere `hunch' is insufficient to justify a stop, the likelihood of criminal activity need not rise to the level required for probable cause, and it falls considerably short of satisfying a preponderance of the evidence standard." United States v. Arvizu, 534 U.S. 266, 274, 122 S.Ct. 744, 151 L.Ed.2d 740 (2002) (citations omitted). "To determine whether an officer's suspicion of criminal activity was reasonable, a court must evaluate the totality of the circumstances as they appeared to the officer at the time of the stop." United States v. Ocampo, 890 F.2d 1363, 1368 (7th Cir.1989) (citing United States v. Cortez, 449 U.S. 411, 418, 101 S.Ct. 690, 66 L.Ed.2d 621 (1981)). In making this determination, "the relevant inquiry is not whether particular conduct is `innocent' or `guilty,' but the degree of suspicion that attaches to particular types of noncriminal acts." United States v. Sokolow, 490 U.S. 1, 10, 109 S.Ct. 1581, 104 L.Ed.2d 1 (1989) (internal quotations omitted).
In this case, Officer Swisher was present when the police dispatcher received a call from Millie McDonald, a newspaper carrier, reporting what she perceived to be suspicious activity. McDonald informed the dispatcher that a white car was parked behind a closed Oil Exchange. McDonald further informed the police dispatcher that she initially observed the car parked behind the Oil Exchange facing one direction, that she continued on her paper route, and that she returned sometime later to find the same vehicle still parked behind the Oil Exchange facing the opposite direction. McDonald's call was not an anonymous tip. She clearly identified her name and occupation, and it was evident from her statement how she came to observe the white vehicle parked behind the closed business establishment.2
Immediately after receiving McDonald's information, Officer Swisher was able to respond because of the police station's close proximity to the Oil Exchange. As Officer Swisher was leaving the police station, he observed a white car drive from behind the closed Oil Exchange. At this point, Officer Swisher was able to verify the accuracy of McDonald's tip. Officer Swisher then observed the car turn right onto Route 2, without stopping before entering the road, and make a sharp right turn, without signaling, into the Mobile station. At this point, Officer Swisher also turned into the Mobile station and parked his patrol car fifteen feet behind the car that he was dispatched to investigate. Officer Swisher believed it was unusual for a car to be parked at that hour of the morning behind a closed business. He also knew that several businesses had been burglarized in the area.
We believe that these facts, viewed in their totality, provided Officer Swisher with reasonable suspicion to detain briefly the car's occupants in order to verify or dispel his well-founded suspicions that the occupants had been, or were about to be, engaged in criminal activity. See Ocampo, 890 F.2d at 1368 ("A Terry investigatory stop is a brief detention which gives officers a chance to verify (or dispel) well-founded suspicions that a person has been, is, or is about to be engaged in criminal activity.").
We do not think that this court's decision in United States v. Packer, 15 F.3d 654 (7th Cir.1994), requires a contrary result. In Packer, police responded to a citizen's telephone call reporting a "suspicious vehicle," described by the citizen as a yellow Cadillac with four black male occupants, parked alongside a residential street at 1:00 a.m. Id. at 655. Three police officers, in two vehicles, arrived on the residential street moments later, and found what they described as a "greenish" Cadillac with fogged over windows. Id. Two officers in a police van "pulled directly behind the Cadillac and activated the white `take down lights' on top of the van to illuminate the Cadillac." Id. At the same time, a third officer pulled his patrol car in front of the Cadillac to prevent it from leaving. As one of the officers approached the Cadillac, she pointed a flashlight and asked the occupants to put their hands in the air where she could see them. During the course of this encounter, the police recovered a shotgun, and the defendant subsequently was charged with being a felon in possession of a firearm.
The court in Packer held that the shotgun should have been suppressed because the officers lacked reasonable suspicion to justify the investigatory stop. See id. The court reasoned that "[a]lthough." Id. at 658. The court further reasoned that "[w]hile the car had in fact been parked there for more than an hour, other than the opaque mist on the windows, no evidence shows that the officers were aware of how long the car had been parked." Id.
Although the court in Packer held that the officers lacked reasonable suspicion on the facts of that case, the court also stated that "the minimum threshold of `specific and articulable facts' sufficient to give rise to reasonable suspicion" is only "marginally" higher than those presented. Id. at 659. We believe that the facts before the district court in this case satisfy that higher threshold. The caller in Packer was anonymous. In contrast, McDonald identified both her name and occupation, an occupation that not only made her identity readily subject to verification, but that also made clear the reason why she had observed so closely the presence of the white car. Second, the caller in Packer did not indicate how long the car had been parked. In Mr. Hendricks' case, although McDonald did not provide the dispatcher with a precise length of time, she stated that she observed the car parked behind the Oil Exchange, continued on her paper route, and then observed the car again, still parked behind the closed business establishment. This account necessarily involved some lapse of time. In addition, McDonald reported that the car changed directions during the time that it was parked behind the Oil Exchange. Third, the car in Packer was parked along a residential street. In contrast, the car occupied by Mr. Hendricks and Barnes was parked behind a closed business establishment. Finally, the officers in Packer were not aware of any specific and recent criminal activity in the area, nor did the officers rely on the general level of the neighborhood's crime rate. In the present case, Officer Swisher testified that he knew there had been several businesses recently burglarized in the area. For these reasons, we believe that Packer does not control our determination in this case.
Indeed, given the distinctions between Packer and Mr. Hendricks' case, we believe that the Eleventh Circuit's decision in United States v. Briggman, 931 F.2d 705 (11th Cir.1991), is more instructive. In Briggman, an experienced police officer was on routine patrol at approximately 4:00 a.m. when he noticed an occupied vehicle parked in a commercial lot shared by several business establishments. The officer was aware that numerous larcenies and robberies recently had occurred in the surrounding business establishments. For these reasons, the officer began cruising the parking lot. As the officer approached the defendant's vehicle for the second time, the defendant exited the parking lot, turned in front of the officer's vehicle and onto a major thoroughfare. The officer then stopped the defendant for further investigation. The court held that the stop was justified and reasoned that the officer's "suspicion reasonably was aroused when he noticed [the defendant] parked in a parking lot at 4:00 a.m. in a high crime area, when commercial establishments served by the lot were closed for the night." Id. at 709.
Subsequent to the initial encounter, which we have determined was consensual, a series of events unfolded that provided Officer Swisher with additional justification to make a stop. The officer testified that he observed Barnes' suspicious behavior, including her rapid approach, her nervous demeanor, her evasive responses to his question of why she was parked behind the Oil Exchange, and her efforts to block his view of the stolen vehicle and its passenger. When Officer Swisher approached the vehicle to ask Mr. Hendricks for identification, he noticed that Mr. Hendricks was slumped over so that his head was barely visible; that the lock on the passenger door was completely missing; that the key in the ignition was turned upside down and barely stuck into the ignition; and that wires and broken plastic were hanging from the lower section of the steering column. These facts certainly gave Officer Swisher additional reasonable suspicion that the car had been stolen.
Although Mr. Hendricks does not seriously contend that the encounter exceeded the permissible scope of a Terry stop, we note briefly that it did not. An officer is entitled to "`ask the detainee a moderate number of questions to determine his identity and to try to obtain information confirming or dispelling the officer's suspicions.'" United States v. Felix-Felix, 275 F.3d 627, 633 (7th Cir.2001) (quoting Berkemer v. McCarty, 468 U.S. 420, 439, 104 S.Ct. 3138, 82 L.Ed.2d 317 (1984)). An officer also is entitled "to take reasonable steps to insure [his] own safety." United States v. Jackson, 300 F.3d 740, 746 (7th Cir.2002). An officer therefore may order the detainee to exit the vehicle, see United States v. Davis, 200 F.3d 1053, 1054 (7th Cir.2000), and he may conduct a pat-down search of the detainee's outer clothing, see Jackson, 300 F.3d at 746.
Officer Swisher followed this course of conduct in his encounter with Mr. Hendricks. When Mr. Hendricks took an abnormally long time to comply with Officer Swisher's request for identification and appeared to be having difficulty with something that the officer could not see, Officer Swisher asked him to step outside of the car. Officer Swisher then conducted a protective pat-down of Mr. Hendricks' outer clothing and discovered a metal object in his pocket, which the officer knew from prior experience to be a magazine for a handgun. After Mr. Hendricks admitted that he did not have a gun permit, Officer Swisher handcuffed him for officer safety and saw a loaded handgun on the floorboard partially hidden beneath the passenger seat. At this point, Officer Swisher had probable cause to arrest Mr. Hendricks. Given the foregoing sequence of events, the district court properly denied Mr. Hendricks' motion to suppress.
B. Jury Instructions
Mr. Hendricks next submits that the district court's instruction to the jury regarding possession was erroneous. In particular, he argues that it was error for the district court to instruct the jury that momentary possession of the firearm was sufficient to convict. Mr. Hendricks also submits that the district court erred by refusing to give the theory of defense instructions that he tendered.
We review a district court's decision regarding jury instructions for an abuse of discretion. See United States v. Kosth, 257 F.3d 712, 717 (7th Cir.2001); United States v. Swanquist, 161 F.3d 1064, 1075 (7th Cir.1998). A jury instruction will not be disturbed on appeal if the instruction "fairly and accurately" summarizes the law and has "support in the record." Kosth, 257 F.3d at 717. However, we review a district court's decision not to instruct the jury on a theory of defense de novo. See United States v. Irorere, 228 F.3d 816, 825 (7th Cir.2000).
In this case, the district court instructed the jury that:
Possession of an object is the ability to control it. Possession exists when an individual holds an object, in this case a firearm, even if the handling is only momentary, as long as the individual does so knowingly and intends to handle the object. Possession may also exist even when a person is not in physical contact with the object, but knowingly has the power and intention to exercise direction or control over it, either directly or through others. A person can possess an object without owning the object, provided that the person has the power and intention to control the object.
R.55, Instruction 17. The district court further instructed the jury that "knowingly" meant "that the defendant realized what he was doing and was aware of the nature of his conduct, and did not act through ignorance, mistake or accident." R.55, Instruction 18.
Before the district court, Mr. Hendricks objected to the possession instruction on the ground that "by indicating that momentary possession of an object is sufficient... it does not focus adequately upon the other component ..., that [the] object be held knowing that [the] object was a firearm, as it applies to this case." Trial Tr. Vol. II at 148. On appeal, Mr. Hendricks makes a similar argument, but he couches it in different terms; he argues that, although he held the firearm momentarily, he did so only for an "academic" period of time, which is insufficient to establish guilt under § 922(g)(1). Appellant's Br. at 20. `academic' `a).
The possession instruction clearly informed the jury that it was required to find that Mr. Hendricks knowingly and intentionally possessed the firearm in order to convict. Because the instruction fairly and accurately summarized the law, we must conclude that the district court did not abuse its discretion when it instructed the jury that momentary possession of the firearm was sufficient to convict.
Mr. Hendricks also challenges the district court's refusal to give either of the instructions that he tendered on his theory of defense. A criminal defendant is entitled to a jury instruction on his particular theory of defense provided that four circumstances exist: "." Swanquist, 161 F.3d at 1075 (internal quotations omitted); see also Irorere, 228 F.3d at 825.
Mr. Hendricks' first proposed instruction stated:
On the other hand, mere presence in the vicinity of a firearm, or mere knowledge of its physical location, does not constitute possession under the statute. It is even possible for a defendant to touch a firearm, and not have possession of it.
R.50, Supp. Instruction 1. The district court refused to give this instruction on two grounds. First, the district court indicated that the instruction was not supported by the relevant case law in this circuit. See Trial Tr. Vol. II at 156. Second, the district court stated that the court's possession instruction, coupled with the definition of "knowing," adequately conveyed Mr. Hendricks' theory of defense to the jury. The district court also stated that Mr. Hendricks was "at liberty to argue this theory in front of the jury." Id.
We believe that the district court correctly analyzed the situation. Moreover, with respect to the last sentence of Mr. Hendricks' proposed instruction, the district court certainly did not err in refusing to give Mr. Hendricks' instruction on mere touching of the weapon. Mr. Hendricks correctly notes that, in United States v. Wilson, 922 F.2d 1336, 1338-39 (7th Cir.1991), we suggested, albeit in dicta, that the mere touching of a firearm, bereft of any knowledge that one was actually touching a firearm, would not support a conviction. Such a theory is simply not raised by the evidence in the case before us. Although a defendant's theory of defense need only have "some foundation in the evidence, however tenuous," United States v. Given, 164 F.3d 389, 394 (7th Cir.1999), there is no evidence in this record to support Mr. Hendricks' proposed instruction. By Mr. Hendricks' own admission, he did not "merely touch" inadvertently the firearm; he testified that he held it in his hands and kept it well within his reach.
Finally, we agree with the district court that Mr. Hendricks' theory was reflected adequately in the court's instruction. In United States v. Rice, 995 F.2d 719, 725 (7th Cir.1993), we affirmed the district court's decision to refuse an identical theory of defense instruction. We "rejected the contention that possession instructions must include a qualifier that `mere proximity' is not possession" and determined that the district court's instruction coupled with the defendant's ability to argue his theory to the jury adequately presented his theory of defense. Id. As in Rice, the district court properly determined that its possession instruction, which clearly required Mr. Hendricks to knowingly and intentionally possess the firearm in order to convict, coupled with Mr. Hendricks' ability to argue his theory in front of the jury, fully presented his defense theory.
Mr. Hendricks also requested that the district court give an "innocent possession" instruction, which provided:
If you find from the evidence that Mr. Hendricks discovered the firearm in question, under his passenger seat, in a stolen car and held the firearm to attempt to discover[] the identity of the object and upon realizing it was a firearm abandoned it, you may return a verdict of not guilty.
R.50, Supp. Instruction 2. The district court refused to give this instruction on the ground that it was not supported by the evidence. See Trial Tr. Vol. II at 157.
We find no error in the district court's refusal to give this instruction for two reasons. First, we previously have limited an "innocent possession" defense to a § 922(g)(1) charge to situations in which the elements of a justification defense (i.e., necessity, duress or self-defense) are present. See United States v. Perez, 86 F.3d 735 (7th Cir.1996); United States v. Toney, 27 F.3d 1245 (7th Cir.1994); United States v. Elder, 16 F.3d 733 (7th Cir.1994). A justification defense clearly is not at issue in this case "because there was no evidence of an imminent threat of death or bodily injury to [Mr. Hendricks] or others." United States v. Mason, 233 F.3d 619, 623 (D.C.Cir.2000), (amended Jan. 10, 2001). Mr. Hendricks does not contend otherwise.
Second, even if we were to adopt a distinct "innocent possession" defense (apart from any justification defense), the evidence in this case would not justify the giving of such an instruction. In Mason, the District of Columbia Circuit recognized a narrow defense for "innocent possession" under § 922(g)(1). Id. at 624. However, the court stated that, in order for this defense to be triggered, two requirements must be satisfied:.
Id. (internal quotations omitted). In this case, the evidence was sufficient to create a triable issue of fact on the first requirement. Both Mr. Hendricks and Barnes testified that Mr. Hendricks was unaware of the handgun until they were in Lowell and he reached under the passenger seat.3 However, Mr. Hendricks was not entitled to the instruction because there was no evidence to support the second requirement. Nothing in the record indicates that Mr. Hendricks "had the intent to turn the weapon over to the police," let alone "that he was pursuing such an intent with immediacy and through a reasonable course of conduct." Id. Mr. Hendricks did not testify that he planned to turn the gun over to the police. Moreover, the evidence shows that Mr. Hendricks had ample opportunity to turn the weapon over to the police but that he failed to do so. First, the police station was located on the same block as the Oil Exchange and Mobile station. Second, there was a pay phone outside of the Mobile station. Mr. Hendricks testified that he used this pay phone to call his aunt to see if she could pick him up; however, Mr. Hendricks did not attempt to call the police. Finally, when Officer Swisher pulled in behind the parked car at the Mobile station, Mr. Hendricks immediately should have notified the officer of the gun's whereabouts. But he did not do so. In fact, Mr. Hendricks did not tell Officer Swisher about the gun even after the officer found the loaded magazine in his pocket and specifically asked him where the gun was located. Without any evidentiary support that Mr. Hendricks took appropriate action to turn the weapon over to the police, the district court properly refused Mr. Hendricks' request to give the "innocent possession" instruction.
C. Sentencing Issues
Because Mr. Hendricks previously had been convicted of three unrelated violent felonies, the district court sentenced him pursuant to 18 U.S.C. § 924(e), the Armed Career Criminal Act, to a term of 188 months in prison.4 Mr. Hendricks argues that Apprendi v. New Jersey, 530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000), requires a jury, not the district court, to determine whether the maximum statutory penalty for 18 U.S.C. § 922(g)(1) should be increased from 10 years to life imprisonment pursuant to 18 U.S.C. § 924(e) based on his criminal history.5
Mr. Hendricks' argument is foreclosed by this court's holdings in United States v. Morris, 293 F.3d 1010 (7th Cir.2002), United States v. Thomas, 280 F.3d 1149 (7th Cir.2002), and United States v. Skidmore, 254 F.3d 635 (7th Cir.2001). In those cases, this court considered whether prior offenses used to enhance the applicable penalty constituted an element of the offense. We determined that, under the Supreme Court's decisions in Apprendi v. New Jersey, 530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000), and Almendarez-Torres v. United States, 523 U.S. 224, 118 S.Ct. 1219, 140 L.Ed.2d 350 (1998), recidivism to enhance a sentence is a traditional sentencing factor and therefore determined by the court and not by the jury.6
Finally, Mr. Hendricks submits that the district court erred by denying him a 3 level reduction in his offense level for acceptance of responsibility.7 The Government maintains that the district court properly denied Mr. Hendricks the reduction because he denied an essential factual element of guilt and gave materially false testimony. We agree with the Government. A district court's determination that a defendant is not entitled to a sentence reduction for acceptance of responsibility is a factual one that we review for clear error. See United States v. Cunningham, 103 F.3d 596, 597-98 (7th Cir.1996). The defendant bears the burden to "clearly demonstrate acceptance of responsibility by a preponderance of the evidence." Id. at 598.
While a challenge to the legal basis for a charge (such as a constitutional challenge to a statute or a challenge to the applicability of a statute to the defendant's conduct) does not preclude the possibility of an acceptance of responsibility reduction, the Guidelines explain that the § 3E1.1 `adjustment is not intended to apply to a defendant who puts the government to its burden of proof at trial by denying the essential factual elements of guilt, is convicted, and only then admits guilt and expresses remorse.'
United States v. Hamzat, 217 F.3d 494, 500 (7th Cir.2000) (quoting U.S.S.G. § 3E1.1 Application Note 2); see also Cunningham, 103 F.3d at 598 (stating that a reduction for acceptance of responsibility generally is not available for defendants who go to trial to contest "the essential factual elements of guilt" (quoting U.S.S.G. § 3E1.1 Application Note 2)).
Mr. Hendricks contends that he should have received a reduction for acceptance of responsibility because at trial he admitted possessing the gun even though he denied that he had the requisite mens rea to sustain a conviction. Mr. Hendricks is correct that a legal challenge to the applicability of a statute to a defendant's actions does not necessarily exempt the defendant from an acceptance of responsibility reduction. However, the facts of this case do not support such a characterization. An essential factual element of guilt under § 922(g)(1) is that the defendant "knowingly possessed the firearm ... described in the indictment." United States v. Bradley, 145 F.3d 889, 893 (7th Cir.1998). By denying that he knowingly possessed the gun, Mr. Hendricks challenged an essential factual element of the charged offense. For this reason, the district court did not err by refusing to grant him a reduction for acceptance of responsibility. See United States v. Williams, 202 F.3d 959, 962 (7th Cir.2000) ("If a defendant challenges factual evidence of guilt as well as legal principles, however, he typically will be ineligible to receive the acceptance of responsibility reduction.").
Conclusion
For the foregoing reasons, we affirm the judgment of the district court.
AFFIRMED
Notes:
Notably, the court questioned "whether [the defendants] could have maneuvered their car out of the parking lot in this situation."United States v. Pavelski, 789 F.2d 485, 488 (7th Cir.1986).
InEdwards v. Cabrera, 58 F.3d 290 (7th Cir.1995), a police dispatcher received a call from a dispatcher for PACE, a suburban Chicago public bus transit agency. The dispatcher reported that a PACE bus driver thought he had seen a drug transaction involving five black men. The dispatcher did not provide the police with the bus driver's name. In considering the reliability of the informant, the court determined that "[t]he bus driver was not anonymous." Id. at 291. The court reasoned that "while the police did not know his name, we can presume his identity was (and is) easily ascertainable by the officers" and "[t]he officers also knew his occupation." Id. Given these characteristics, the court determined that certain inferences could be drawn regarding the informant's reliability and that the bus driver "must have appeared to the police as a citizen legitimately reporting what he believed to be criminal activity." Id. Like the bus driver in Edwards, McDonald must have appeared to Officer Swisher as a citizen legitimately reporting what she believed to be suspicious activity.
The jury, of course, was entitled to disbelieve this testimony. ATF Special Agent Coulson testified that, on the morning of May 10, Barnes told him that Mr. Hendricks knew the gun was in the car while they were still in Gary
The Armed Career Criminal Act provides in relevant part that a person who is found to have violated § 922(g) "and has three previous convictions by any court referred to in section 922(g)(1) ... for a violent felony ... committed on occasions different from one another ... shall be ... imprisoned not less than fifteen years." 18 U.S.C. § 924(e)(1)
The Supreme Court has held thatApprendi v. New Jersey, 530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000), does not apply where the mandatory minimum penalty for a crime is increased but the statutory maximum is not exceeded. See Harris v. United States, 536 U.S. 545, 122 S.Ct. 2406, 2414 & 2421, 153 L.Ed.2d 524 (2002) (Kennedy, J., plurality and Breyer, J., concurring respectively). However, that is not the situation we are confronted with in this case. Had Mr. Hendricks not qualified as an armed career criminal, the maximum sentence he could have received for a violation of § 922(g)(1) is ten years, but, because he qualified as an armed career criminal, the district court was required to sentence Mr. Hendricks to a minimum of fifteen years in prison for violating § 922(g)(1).
BecauseApprendi does not require that Mr. Hendricks' sentence be reversed, we need not and do not reach the merits of his objections to the obstruction of justice or the altered/obliterated serial number enhancement. These enhancements do not affect his sentence. Under U.S.S.G. § 2K2.1, Mr. Hendricks' base offense level would have been 20; with a 2 level enhancement for both obstruction of justice and an altered/obliterated serial number, his total offense level would have been 24. However, the district court properly sentenced Mr. Hendricks as an armed career criminal pursuant to 18 U.S.C. § 924(e) and U.S.S.G. § 4B1.4. Section 4B1.4 provides that an armed career criminal's offense level is at least 33, absent a reduction for acceptance of responsibility. See U.S.S.G. § 4B1.4(b). Pursuant to this section, the district court determined Mr. Hendricks' offense level to be 33. Consequently, the enhancements did not affect his sentence in any way. Because any error relating to the obstruction of justice and altered/obliterated serial number enhancements would be harmless, we decline to reach the merits of Mr. Hendricks' objections to those enhancements. See United States v. Smith, 223 F.3d 554, 578-79 (7th Cir.2000) (holding that any error in assessing defendant's criminal history was harmless, as defendant's base offense level would carry sentence of life in prison regardless of defendant's criminal history).
Unlike the enhancements for obstruction of justice and altered/obliterated serial number, it is necessary to reach the merits of this argument. Under § 4B1.4(b), 33 is the minimum offense level for an armed career criminalunless a reduction for acceptance of responsibility applies. See U.S.S.G. § 4B1.4(b)(3) ("If an adjustment from § 3E1.1 (Acceptance of Responsibility) applies, decrease the offense level by the number of levels corresponding to that adjustment.")About This GigapanToggle

- Description
This panorama records a scene which may never be seen again in the near future. In recent years, a colony of harbor seals has reclaimed it's traditional haul out site on La Jolla's Casa Beach, creating an ideal situation for viewing natural seal behavior. Unfortunately for the seals and the thousands of people who are delighted by them, a woman has successfully brought a lawsuit through the California courts to assert her right to use the beach and force the city of San Diego to dredge it to evict the seals. Their only hope now is that the Federal Marine Mammal Protection Act will trump the state court rulings and allow them this one small patch of sand.

I am a fan of CodeIgniter for its ease of use. I have developed several ecommerce projects using this “beautiful” framework. While working on my first ecommerce project with CodeIgniter, I faced a problem with URLs. The site was suppose to use both “http” and “https”. But with CodeIgnitor we can define one base URL, which can be either “http” or “https”. Then I came up with an idea and now I am going to share that idea with you.
What I am going to do…
We will create secure version of some functions. For this we will make changes in CodeIgnitor’s URL helper(url_helper.php), Config library (Config.php) and Config (config.php) files. We will be creating secure version of following functions:
Lets’ start…
First we will add the following config element in the config file:
Then, open the url_helper.php file (system/helpers/url_helper.php) and add the following codes. You may use a separate helper file if you do not want to alter the url_helper.php file.
Now, add the following code in Config.php file (system/libraries/Config.php):
Now what we have…
Now what we have? We have secured versions of those function. You may now use them as their insecured version. Enjoy coding ;).Hi David, what is the preferred way to submit contributions to the new git repo? Link to my git repo or `git send-email`, or anything else?

The Blue Jackets look to put the memory of a tough loss to the league's best team behind them when they visit the Los Angeles Kings on Saturday.
Columbus (11-11-3) opened a three-game road trip with a 3-2 loss to San Jose on Thursday. The Blue Jackets held a 31-22 edge in shots and took a first-period lead on Rick Nash's goal, but fell to 0-2 against the NHL-leading Sharks this season and 1-13-2 all-time in San Jose.
."
The Blue Jackets have been very competitive in their last two road games - both against top contenders - but have nothing to show for their efforts. They fell 5-3 in Detroit on Nov. 28, when they yielded the go-ahead goal with two minutes left in the third period.
Columbus won't be facing as strong an opponent Saturday, as it looks to duplicate its strong play at Staples Center last season. The Blue Jackets won twice in Los Angeles to snap a five-game losing streak there and went 3-0-1 overall in 2007-08 against the Kings (10-11-4).
The Blue Jackets, though, continue to struggle on the power play. Their 9.9 percent conversion rate with the man advantage is the worst in the NHL.
Los Angeles lost its third straight on Friday, 5-4 in a shootout to Edmonton. The Kings, who led 4-3 after two periods, have taken a lead into the third period in their last three games, only to come up with just one point out of a possible six.
They have been outscored 7-0 in their last three third periods.
Jason LaBarbera took the loss Friday, entering after Erik Ersberg allowed three goals in the first period. It is unclear who will start Saturday for the Kings, who are 1-4 in the second half of back-to-back games.
"First period, the goaltender was changed because the goaltender wasn't good enough," Los Angeles coach Terry Murray said. "Ersberg wasn't good enough."
Alexander Frolov and Michal Handzus each had a goal and an assist during the Kings' four-goal second period Friday. Frolov, who had been benched in the third period of Tuesday's 4-2 loss at Phoenix for a mistake that led to a Coyotes rally, did not register a point in last season's four games against Columbus.Monday night, Sonny Rollins spoke live at his website about the controversy over the New Yorker's publication of 11 fabricated quotes that the magazine's website attributed to him and later labeled as satire. Dressed in a red shirt and cap, and wearing white rimmed sunglasses, Sonny opened by confessing that he sensed from the start that the column ("Sonny Rollins: In His Own Words") was a joke akin to a Mad magazine spoof, since he knew he had never said any of it. But he also said he was troubled that the column, which originally came without a disclaimer, was being misinterpreted by musicians and friends who asked him why he was trashing jazz and his own career. Sonny then talked at length about why the invented quotes were a disservice to the music. Here are Sonny's remarks in full...
To me, this matter isn't quite resolved, and I'd love to know the answers to the following questions...
1. Why was Sonny Rollins chosen in the first place as the spoof's target and who else was considered?
2. Why didn't New Yorker editors feel the column required an accompanying disclaimer from the start?
3. If one truly believes that fabricating quotes and not letting readers in on the joke is satire, why didn't the magazine choose major rock or rap stars, who certainly would have created much more buzz?
4. Why hasn't anyone at the New Yorker called Sonny to apologize for any grief or stress the column might have caused the 83-year-old tenor saxophonist?
To many, this is either a spoof gone bad or an obvious gag misinterpreted by those who can't take a joke. To me, it's a matter of taste and editorial judgment. Publishing a column of quotes that you know to be fake and knowingly attributing them to someone who never said them as a spoof, without a disclaimer, is at best cruel. While some may know the column is a gag, content today, like uranium, lives on forever.
Going forward, I hope the New Yorker's satirists will pick on targets who deserve the ribbing and leave the greats alone.Poisoned

After the success of the past two editions, the extreme windsurfing competition “Reunion Wave Classic” will take place again this year from August 25 to September 5 on the best spots around St Pierre.
This time, the association “Reunion Windsurf” and the local rider Pierre Godet will be in charge of the organization.The company Open Ocean Media, who hosted the previous circuit “Wave Classic Invitational”, will be solely in charge of the communication on this legendary event.
So far, 6 international riders have answered the call to challenge the powerful waves of the Indian Ocean: young Leon Jamaer (21/Germany), Camille Juban (21/Guadeloupe) and Jules Denel (21/France ), Tom Hartmann (31/Autriche), Julien Taboulet (31/France) and Colin Sifferlen (26/New Caledonia). Remains to be confirmed the locals that will join this year, all led by Pierre Godet (voted best local rider in 2010).
10 days of competition, free choice of the spots depending on the conditions, riders judging themselves… Time for extreme and radical moves, under the watchful eye of a video team and a professional photographer who will be there to capture their achievements. The goal is simple: have fun, push the limits of waveriding, providing a real show and promote the Reunion island through the images taken.
While it is working hard around St Pierre for the final preparations of the windsurfing event of the year on La Reunion island, the riders start to pack their boardbags with, for sure, a lot of spare equipment to face the powerful waves and the sharp reef of the island’s south shores.
Most riders will arrive on Wednesday morning at Roland Garros airport, and then move to St Pierre where is located the hotel “Couchers de soleil”, partner and headquarters of the RWC since the beginning of the history.
The three locals selected to participate alongside the champions this year, Steven Pichot, Sylvain Bourlard and Pierre Godet, are ready to welcome the pros once again, and are ready to live another extraordinary adventure. Pierre Godet : “we spent a lot of energy this year in this project with the help of our partners. We are in the starting blocks for another great show! “. Steven Pichot: “My best souvenir of the past editions is the ability of the pros to adapt themselves to the conditions and make the most of it. As for me this year, I will try to approach the contest with less pressure than in the past to make the most of the conditions and the ambiance.” Sylvain Bourlard: “I am very pleased to participate in an event like the “Reunion Wave Classic”. This is my first competition as I am more accustomed to trips. I intend to make the most of it, to have fun and try to challenge myself.”
If the winter does not have shown its best yet in La Reunion with a lack of wind and waves, the forecast seems rather optimistic for the coming days. Event will start on Thursday 25. Keep in touch with the help of our communication tools below. There should be some hot action kicking in pretty quickly!!!
More at"I'm going to take a short break from the AWI" - who was I kidding? As Michael Corleone would have put it (had he been a wargamer), every time I think I've got out, the period pulls me back in. I've realised that the problem is that I regard anything that is not AWI-related as a waste of time. Yes, I could finish off Newcastle's Whitecoats, but in the time it would take to do that I could paint another British Saratoga regiment. In any event, the cancellation of SELWG and the ongoing nightmare that is the British postal services means that I am not able to acquire the other few packs of figures that I need to complete the regiment. So the Whitecoats are being bumped off until later in the year and I've spent the past couple of weeks feverishly painting more AWI stuff. This happily means that there are lots of pics to come over the next few days. It's also made me wonder whether I could paint all the lead I've bought this year before the end of December - that really would be a first.
On Monday or Tuesday there will be photos of more Foundry civilians, followed by Conquest Miniatures' mounted Iroquois (see the pic above) and some rather angry frontiersmen and settlers. After those, hopefully early next week some time, will be the two Hessian regiments that I wanted to finish off. I think I'll then crack on with the 62nd Foot and another, as yet unidentified, American regiment. I bought the figures for the Hessian von Bose regiment at Colours, so want to paint that unit by the end of the year. Incidentally, I am half way through Mark Urban's "Fusiliers" and it is outstanding, so go out and buy it!

Love the Appaloosa!Losers on the Road, Days 3 - 8: Whiskey Boot and Road Sodas
Thursday 12:12 p .m. - The show goes amazing, but is definitely the drunkest, youngest crowd we've ever encountered. Halfway through the show the crowd just grabs Robot Elvis and drags him offstage. Chris almost gets attacked for his basket of pizza rolls. And a Road House joke does not go over well. At all. "We're Millennials! Move on!" yells one guy. We don't want to live in a world where no one knows about Road House, and will continue to preach the Swayze gospel. So fuck that guy.
Jeremy then leaves with a strange woman, and we hope he isn't murdered in his sleep. We'll pick him up tomorrow.
Friday - 9:00 a.m. - "We have your money. Come to Chinatown." We actually wish this story was more badass, but we just had to pick up the rest of our money from the DC show club promoter the night before. But, out of context, it's pretty badass.
Friday - 9:06 a.m. - Leaving DC, we stop at a fireworks stand next to a gas station and hear a sentence we have never actually heard at a fireworks stand before: "Good Morning!"
Friday - 5:10 p.m. - Driving a giant cargo van in New York is as exactly as shitty as you might imagine. And we don't have a horn. And it's hot. And we still don't have AC. And everyone sucks.
Friday - 6:30 p.m. - The bartender at Spike Hill in Brooklyn was kind of enough to direct Kelsey to the kitchen but wasn't particularly interested in asking the cooks to stop what they're doing and microwave us pizza rolls for the third round of our game show. He showed her to the door and without explanation returned to work. "Yo necessito pizza rolls frito por favor," got the job done but how she wound up doing dishes while the Totino's "baked," we're still not sure.
Friday - 11 p.m. - Jeremy's apartment doesn't have air-conditioning so we stayed in the neighborhood where most of The Sopranos was filmed in New Jersey, with Dylan Clark, the lead singer of the kick-ass band the Milwaukees.
On the way, Chris becomes the unlikely voice of reason and stops Kelsey and Jeremy from setting off the fireworks we bought in DC in Times Square. Jeremy still thinks we missed an awesome opportunity to get arrested.
Saturday - 12:15 p.m. - Longest drive of the tour: New York to Columbus, Ohio. Luckily we have the book "Dreaming the Chase" to pass the time. This is an erotic fiction book about laundry.
We arrive in Columbus just in time for Kelsey to meet Jeremy's friend Ben's son, a fellow ginger. They play with toys and contemplate not having souls.
Saturday - 2 p.m. - You can't buy beer at the gas station in Pennsylvania. You have to go to a "beer distributor," even though that's the gas station's job in every sane part of the world. "I am told we can buy six packs of beer at this Applebees," Chris loudly asks the front of house hostess. Chris has $14 and change on an Applebees gift card that he has had in his wallet for a few years. Finally, it has found its purpose.
Saturday - 10:35 p.m. - The Columbus show was full of technical issues to the point that we couldn't close the show in the normal manner. Instead, Jeremy and Chris broke out a version of Big Star's "Thirteen" while Jeremy's parents slow danced.
Sunday - 9 a.m. - Chris wakes up on a porch. He doesn't remember how. At some point, extra children show up at the house we are staying at, which means it is a perfect time for us to leave. Nashville, five hours, or so we've heard.
Sunday - 5:23 p.m. - Nineteen miles out of Nashville, traffic has come to a complete standstill. Jeremy, Chris and Evan take the opportunity to skateboard down interstate 65. We all made it back into the van before a state trooper appeared in the other direction.
Monday - 12:16 a.m. - (Computer stolen by Malia Chamness, who offered us a place to stay this evening)
They've surrounded us and inundated us with their ritualistic literature. We can't tell where they are from based on their obscure accents that change from word to word, sentence to sentence. SEND HELP...but not right away, because we still have beer.
Monday - 1:42 a.m. - It turns out Malia is a dietician, and she's been working with Evan over the last hour. If we could stay in Nashville, there's a small chance our new friendship might yield a healthier Evan. Alas, we must return to St. Louis tomorrow. If you've come this far, perhaps you're willing to go a little further: we will be celebrating our homecoming and One Year Birthday Monday night at the Heavy Anchor around 8 p.m. We are so excited we can barely sit still or hold a thought in our heads. We hope we can see our friends and shake their hands. We hope the Heavy Anchor is as blue as it has been in our dreams. We hope. That was a Shawshank Redemption joke.
Will Evan make it home without eating garbage? Will these poor girls hosting us get any sleep?
Stay tuned on Facebook and Twitter!

Our Chief LibrarianFirst Date: January 1988, Greenwich Village, N.Y.
Wedding Date: April 9, 1989
Venue: Beth Jacob Synagogue, Baltimore
Residence: Owings Mills
Favorite Activity: Working out together
In late December 1987, Linda Bogash called her aunt, Marilyn Bennett, to wish her a mazel tov on her daughter’s engagement to Alan Cohen.
The first thing Marilyn told her single niece was that she had the perfect guy for her. Marilyn had met her future son-in-law’s cousin, Seth Cohen, and knew instantly that he was right for Linda.
Linda ventured to New York City for a weekend, and she joined the newly engaged couple and Seth for a double date on New Year’s Eve.
The foursome gathered at a Moroccan restaurant and headed to the South Street Seaport after dinner. At the seaport, the two couples were separated. Long before cell phones, they failed to reconnect. Marilyn had provided Linda with $20 in case she needed to call a cab.
Seth turned out to be a gentleman, and they walked around the seaport, enjoyed drinks and even kissed at midnight. At 2 a.m. they went back to Seth’s car and drove around New York, taking in Central Park and Times Square. By the time Linda reached the Bennett residence, it was 4 a.m.
That Saturday night, Seth took Linda out for their first official date, to a restaurant in the Village. Linda was impressed when Seth asked her to let him know when she arrived home in Randallstown safely after the weekend.
By that time, she was sure.
“I knew from the first kiss that I was going to marry him,” said Linda, 51, a Baltimore County physical education teacher. “Before the kiss (at the seaport) I felt safe. It felt like it was beshert. It felt right.”
They embarked on a long-distance relationship, with Seth arriving in Baltimore Friday evenings twice a month.
Commuting for dates was tough, Seth said, because they didn’t see each other often enough. When together, they did “touristy” stuff, and when apart, they sent each other cards, which Linda still has.
“We exhausted all of the ‘miss you’ cards we could find at Hallmark,” said Seth, who has worked in retail management for 30 years.
That summer, Seth took Linda to Paradise Island, after she decoded a message inviting her in invisible ink. After dinner the first night, they walked the beach. At sunset, Seth knelt down and proposed.
Linda and Seth were married April 9, 1989 at Beth Jacob Synagogue with 130 guests in attendance.
Linda was escorted down the aisle by her sisters, Elana Cavalier and Caren Gresham. Rabbi Ronald Schwartz officiated.
The couple’s daughter, Melissa, was born in November 1991. Lauren joined the family in May 1993, and Julie arrived in November 1997.
They have taken vacations in Wildwood, N.J., the Bahamas, Bermuda and Disney World. Now they are planning a cruise alone to celebrate their 25th anniversary.

Those structures that survive for decades serve as a link to the past, a site for shared memory, and an anchor in the often-changing urban landscape. Often, they were built with a high level of craftsmanship that is unattainable today in new construction.. They date back as far as the 18th century (a grain warehouse converted into modern offices, a jail adapted to house modern residences) to as recent as the early 20th century (two palatial movie theaters rescued from oblivion, a hotel that served as a political hotspot).
1. Balboa Theatre
San Diego, California
The grand urban theaters of the early 1900s often boasted ornate, whimsical architecture with exotic accents. San Diego’s Balboa Theatre may be the only one that also features two 41-foot-high (12.5-m) waterfalls flanking its stage. Originally built for vaudeville and silent movies in 1924, the Balboa served as a Spanish-language cinema, temporary military housing during World War II, and an action-movie house. The city shut the theater’s doors in the mid-1980s for seismic safety reasons.
The city’s redevelopment arm, Centre City Development Corporation, lacked the funds for the necessary structural work for a long time. With the revitalization of Horton Plaza and the Gaslamp Quarter Historic District on either side of the theater, increases in tax increment financing finally enabled the restoration to proceed. Phoenix-based Westlake Reed Leskosky restored the Balboa’s grandeur, updating the infrastructure, repairing the tiled dome, re-creating the entry marquee and exterior blade sign, and restoring the bronze wall paint, the lobby murals, and—of course—the waterfalls. Completed in 2008, the Balboa now hosts local and regional performances.
2. Eastern Market
Washington, D.C.
Ironically, it took a fire to get Washington, D.C.’s Eastern Market the renovation it needed. The city’s oldest continuously operating public market—opened in 1873 and expanded in 1908—became so popular after arts and crafts vendors joined the produce sellers in the 1970s that when the city initiated planning for renovation in 2005, it was decided that the busy market had to remain open during construction, even though that limited the project’s scope. Then a 2007 fire gutted the 1873 building and forced closure of the market, allowing for an expanded effort.
Led by local firm Quinn Evans Architects, the rehabilitation replaced the roof assembly, retaining many of the original iron trusses, while re-creating the historic skylight and ridge vent system that long ago had been lost. Added sustainable strategies included high-efficiency lighting and HVAC systems, high-performance glazing, and stormwater filtration. The fire damage revealed irreparable structural deterioration in the first floor; replacing the floor enabled the relocation of the HVAC system and electrical distribution to the basement. Eastern Market reopened in 2009.
3. Ford Point
Richmond, California
In the 1930s, the Ford Assembly Plant on the San Francisco Bay churned out fossil fuel–burning vehicles. Now, it sports solar panels. In the 1940s, the plant manufactured military jeeps and tanks. Today, audiences attend dance and symphony performances there. Built in 1931 for Henry Ford, the 525,000-square-foot (49,000-sq-m) facility closed in the 1950s, and although the city of Richmond took over the facility in 1975, plans to find a private developer went unfulfilled until Orton Development of Emeryville, California, purchased it in 2004.
The original architect, Albert Kahn, had provided a continuous expanse of steel sash windows and sawtooth clerestories that flooded the space with natural light. Marcy Wong Donn Logan Architects of Berkeley, California, restored these and converted the high-ceilinged waterfront portion into a performance, conference, and dining facility, with a patio facing the wharf. The rest of the building was repurposed for offices. One tenant—solar panel manufacturer SunPower—equipped the sawtooth roof with enough photovoltaic panels to meet virtually all the office tenants’ electricity needs. The project was completed in 2009.
4. Fox Theater
Spokane, Washington
After 70 years of hosting live performances and movies, the art deco Fox Theater in downtown Spokane was showing its age. In addition, its grand 2,300-seat auditorium had been chopped up into three movie theaters and the large murals of the natural world had mostly been painted over. When the owners put the building up for sale in 2000, one potential buyer wanted to demolish it to create a parking lot. Instead, the Spokane Symphony, which had played in the space during the late 1960s and early 1970s, raised the funds to purchase the facility.
Local firm NAC Architecture led the effort, which required meticulously restoring the murals, cleaning and restoring or re-creating historic light fixtures, and removing street-level shops to make room for an expanded lobby and restrooms. Taking out seating from beneath the balcony and modifying portions of the structure allowed the design team to reshape the sightlines to suit the specific requirements of symphonic performances. With the help of both historic and new markets tax credits, the revitalized theater reopened in 2007.
5. Iron Market
Port-au-Prince, Haiti
In the wake of the January 2010 earthquake that laid waste to Haiti’s capital city, reconstruction efforts have been greatly hampered by poverty and corruption. One success story, however, is the rebuilding of the Iron Market, a 19th-century public market that long served as a hub for nearly 1,000 vendors. A fire in 2008 had already damaged the structure, which consists of two naturally ventilated wings connected by a clock tower with four distinctive minarets. The quake finished it off.
Denis O’Brien, the owner of the country’s largest cellphone service, Digicel, decided to bring the 20,000-square-foot (1,900-sq-m) Iron Market back to life—with an unusually aggressive schedule: reopen the market within a year. London-based John McAslan + Partners led the reconstruction, which involved salvaging as many of the original cast-iron columns and bricks as possible, reconstructing the north hall entirely, rehabilitating the clock tower, installing new corrugated-steel roofs on halls, and bringing the facility up to the requirements of the International Building Code. The facility opened on schedule in January 2011.
6. Hilton Garden Inn Jackson Downtown/Standard Life Lofts
Jackson, Mississippi
The King Edward Hotel in Jackson, Mississippi, played a key role in the capital city’s life after opening in 1923, serving as a home for many state legislators and hosting high-class events. Closed in 1967, the 12-story neoclassical revival–style hotel became a blight on downtown as redevelopment schemes fell through and pigeons took up residence.
Finally, the city sold the hotel to New Orleans–based HRI Properties, local developer David Watkins, and local investor Deuce McAlister, who leveraged new markets tax credits to bring the hotel back. Work included restoring the exterior, roof, water-damaged interior, ballroom, and lobby rotunda. Thomas Hamilton & Associates of Richmond, Virginia, designed the hotel interiors. Reopened as the Hilton Garden Inn Jackson Downtown in early 2010, the hotel contains 186 rooms and 64 luxury apartments.
The developers also purchased the 1929 Standard Life Building next door for residential conversion and combined the two projects, allowing use of new markets tax credits to extend to both and drawing on economies of scale in construction. The 18-story former office building opened in 2010 and includes 76 apartments above shops.
7. Meier & Frank Square/The Nines
Portland, Oregon
The Meier & Frank Department Store building has occupied a full city block in downtown Portland since 1932, with the oldest portion dating to 1909. As the store began diminishing its presence in the 1980s and 1990s, the Portland Development Commission worked to find ways to breathe new life into the 15-story structure and brought in Denver-based Sage Hospitality in 2005. Macy’s, which had purchased Meier & Frank, sold the upper nine floors to Sage Hospitality for conversion into a 334-room hotel called the Nines.
Local firm SERA Architects renovated the basement and first five floors to serve as a Macy’s store, which opened in 2007, and inserted a seven-story atrium into the upper floors to bring natural light into the interior. The project also involved seismically strengthening the structure; converting the eighth floor into a hotel lobby; restoring the white terra-cotta facade, historic windows, and mansard roof; and incorporating sustainable strategies such as low-flow plumbing fixtures that enabled the hotel to achieve Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED) Silver certification. The Nines opened in 2008.
8. Navigation Warehouse
Wakefield, England
Along the River Calder in Wakefield, England, two structures erected around 1780 and expanded and joined around 1816 served as a grain warehouse until the late 1980s—a rare surviving example of its building type. By 2005, the foundation had settled significantly and unevenly, and portions of the roof and walls had collapsed. As part of the first phase of the Wakefield Waterfront regeneration initiative—spearheaded by private developer CTP St. James of Leeds, West Yorkshire; the Wakefield Council; and British Waterways of Watford, Hertfordshire—the historic building has been restored and adapted for office and retail use.
The design, by Building Design Partnership Ltd. of Manchester, England, retained as much of the original fabric as possible and inserted a minimal steel structure. Adding vertical circulation and services to the center of the edifice—between the two original warehouse structures—enables maximal flexibility for leasing the spaces to one or multiple tenants. Original artifacts such as grain chutes and cranes were repaired and remain on site. The project was completed in 2008.
9. Salem Jail
Salem, Massachusetts
The Salem Redevelopment Authority of Salem, Massachusetts, had a derelict jail complex on its hands. Declared unfit and closed by court order in 1991, the historic structures—the oldest dating to 1813—suffered from vandalism and neglect. Local residents expressed a desire for a project that would include community amenities, given the site’s proximity to downtown and the waterfront. The winning proposal, by New Boston Ventures of Boston, called for 23 condominiums, a restaurant, and landscaped open space.
When the recession hit, the developers decided to develop the units as apartments eligible for condo conversion in five years, a strategy that opened up alternative financing from state and federal historic tax credits and enabled the project to go forward. Finegold Alexander + Associates Inc. of Boston preserved existing details when possible, including the jail’s distinctive cupolas and stonework, while inserting modern interiors into the granite-block buildings. The housing and restaurant portions opened in 2010. An original jail cell has been preserved as a museum.
10. Sullivan Center
Chicago, Illinois
The nine-building Sullivan Center in the Chicago Loop began taking shape in 1899 with a 12-story department store designed by Louis H. Sullivan, with distinctive white terra-cotta facades and elegant cast-iron ornamentation also employed in additions by other architects. The owner, Carson Pirie Scott & Co. department store, needed less and less space in the building in recent decades. The city partnered with local developer Joseph Freed and Associates LLC starting in 2001 to restore and transform the complex into a mixed-use center.
Local firm Harboe Architects converted the upper floors and a portion of the lower floors for spec office use, repairing the facades, reconstructing a missing cornice, and restoring the cast-iron storefronts. On one building, a long-hidden storefront facade designed by Sullivan was discovered beneath an outer wall. Tax increment financing from the city played a key role in the project, which was completed in 2010. Carson Pirie Scott vacated the building in 2007, but Target is set to join the office tenants in 2012.UPDATE: GWRRA Wing World Photo Contest

Here’s a way to get your new class of students to introduce themselves in a creative and fun “working-together” way.
Use the THINKQUEST – ARTS AND ENTERTAINMENT link (discussed in the July blog). Click on ARTS AND ENTERTAINMENT and then THEATRE. Scroll down to “LIFE ON THE STRINGS.”
Using this puppetry website created by students, introduce them to the history of puppetry. Then have them work in groups of 2s or 3s to create a little skit in which the students tell something about themselves to each other by using a puppet that they make to represent themselves. The students could actually make their puppets as a home project, being sure that their puppet’s design illustrates some feature, personality trait, cultural heritage, hobby, etc. of the student. Each group would present their puppet skit to the rest of the class. Using puppets to introduce one’s self to two other puppets would probably be a lot less intimidating at the beginning of the year than addressing the entire class at one time.
Suggestion: If the students enjoy creating their puppets and skits, perhaps throughout the year, they can use that format to present other learning projects.mrconeman

The 'Mad Max' star's ex-girlfriend Oksana Grigorieva's lawyers are going to court today (15.07.10) to ask a judge to strip the actor of all his parental rights, claiming he is a danger to little Lucia, reports gossip website TMZ.
Mel - who has seven other children with estranged wife Robyn - is being investigated by the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department for domestic abuse and child endangerment, after tapes were released of Oksana claiming he hit her while she was holding Lucia.
While sources close to the 54-year-old actor say he has denied her claims, other tapes have been released which hear him being violent and abusive to his former lover.
It has now been alleged he pulled a handgun on Oksana as she tried to escape his home after a violent row, during which he allegedly broke her teeth and threatened her with a bat.
A source told website RadarOnline.com: "Oksana claims that after Mel hit her, she escaped outside and ran barefooted to the outdoor area at the home, near the pool.
"When Mel disappeared, Oksana said she ran back inside to find her car keys so she could leave the house. That's when Mel re-emerged holding the gun and began waving it in front of Oksana's face.
"Oksana said she was panicked and while searching for the keys, Mel came up to her and said, 'I will show you how to get out of here fast,' which she interpreted to be a death threat."
On her way to her lawyer's office on Wednesday (14.07.10), Oksana promised she would will reveal "everything" about Mel at some point..
The Celtics announced Tuesday afternoon that guard J.R. Giddens underwent successful left knee arthroscopic surgery at the New England Baptist Hospital. The surgery was performed by team physician, Dr. Brian McKeon and assisted by John Rand. No timetable has been set for his return. Giddens, a 6-foot-5 guard, has appeared in 21 games for the Celtics this season and registered season-highs of six points and seven rebounds against New Jersey on Jan. 13.

Third Quarter: Wizards 78 – Celtics 74
Rajon Rondo recorded his 21st double-double of the season during the third quarter. He has posted15 points and 11 assists through three. Kevin Garnett also continued to find his shot and has scored 14 points off of 6-for-7 shooting.
But the Wizards staved off a late third quarter push by the C’s and still lead by four. Up by three, the Wiz pushed their lead back up to six when Butler drew a three-point play against Brian Scalabrine. Rondo was called for an offensive foul driving on Boykins the next trip down the court, and Butler drained a long jumper in Scalabrine’s face. The Celtics are 4-10 when trailing after three.
Second Quarter: Wizards 54 ‘ Celtics 48
The Celtics lost their one-point first quarter lead and trailed by as many as nine points in the second quarter. Both teams shot 52.9%from the field, but turnovers (9-6) and personal fouls (13-9) hampered the Celtics.
The quarter ended on the same note as the first. Pierce and Butler collided as they were heading down the court. Pierce appeared to have stepped on Butler’s foot as the two fell to the ground. Both players lay on the court for a few moments before Pierce ran off, somewhat hobbled.
Pierce, who scored all 11 points in the first quarter, is the game’s leading scorer.
First quarter: Celtics 24 – Wizards 23
The Celtics headed to Washington looking to snap a three-game losing streak. The Wizards did not want to be the reasons why they turned their luck around.
The 16-30 Wiz looked eager early on. Antawn Jamison attempted seven field goals in nine minutes while his team took three more shots than the C’s overall. The Wizards also challenged the Celtics on the board, as they have a reputation of doing so, and the two teams grabbed 11 rebounds apiece.
The Celtics faced an injury scare with two minutes to go in the first. Paul Pierce was taken out of the game ‘ but did not go to the locker room ‘ after injuring his left ankle with two minutes left in the first quarter. He chased after a loose ball with Butler, and Butler landed on Pierce’s ankle as they hit the floor. He had scored 11 points and 4 rebounds in 10 minutes.

Coach Tom Izzo has led Michigan State to the Final Four in six of the last 14 NCAA tournaments, the most recent coming in 2010. As recently as last week our 2013 NCAA bracket picks gave the Spartans just a 5.7% chance to make the semifinals, though, and another trip looked like a long shot.
Moreover, our bracket predictions saw about 2-to-1 odds that Michigan State would not even land a top 4 seed.
Last night, however, Sparty ran the rival Wolverines out of the gym, leading by as much as 30 on the way to a 23 point win. That impressive showing led to a significant jump in our 2013 NCAA bracket picks. Michigan State, now a projected 3-seed, nearly doubled its odds to make it to Atlanta to over 10%.
Indiana travels to East Lansing next Tuesday, and that matchup could go a long way to deciding the Spartans chances of reaching yet another semifinal in our official NCAA bracket picks.luxpresso - 03/25/2015 16:54:11

My husband and I had the vegan sampler (can't remember it's exact name, but it was vegan) and it was absolutely delightful. It's fun to figure out how to eat with the special sour dough flavored pancake abundantly served with it. Good news for people who need gluten free items, the bread/ pancake is gluten free! We couldn't finish it all, but we tried really hard. Highly recommended, we'll be there again soon!

I went to Alem Ethiopian Village for dinner last night, and I have to say I thought it was quite good. My girlfriend and I got the vegetarian combo platter for 2, just to try a bunch of different things at once. I thought having such a combo on the menu was a great idea, as many people (including myself) aren't extremely familiar with Ethiopian food. Everything was delicious and very flavorful. Though I loved the chance to try many different items at one time, my favorite (as well as my girlfriend's) was the Yemiser Wot. When I return, I will probably just order this entree for my meal.
I would definitely recommend this restaurant to any vegan who is in the area, as the vegan options are many (they even mention this right on the front page of their web site), the prices are more than reasonable, and the food is delicious.
We ordered a vegan platter for two. It was delicious for the most part. It was like a sampler of many(or all, not sure) their vegan dishes, on bread with the bread rolls and salad. It was really good. Most of them were delicious, only one or two were kind of bland. There must have been like 8 or so scoops of different things on there. Overall, it was very very good, and something different to try. I recommend it.
I have been trying to get to this restaurant for a few months and boy am I glad I finally made it. This has got to be my all-time favorite Ethiopian restaurant. The food was not only extremely flavorful and well-priced, but they had more vegetarian selections than I've ever seen in any other Ethiopian restaurant.
My mother and I shared the large combo platter for $15.95. It was enough food for two people, but I'm greedy so I wouldn't be opposed to getting the combo for 2 for $26.25. This platter had about 9 different items on it and all of them were good. The yemisir wot (lentils) and gomen (collards) were especially good but I was astoundingly impressed with the shimbra asa, which is a specialty that is not always featured. It's a spicy chickpea dough cooked to look like a thick fish stew. It was part of the combo platter but is also offered as its own main dish.
We also shared an order of sambusa (lentil and onion-filled fried roll). My mom really enjoyed it but I thought it could benefit from a sauce and would have preferred the filling to be a smooth paste, versus whole lentils.
We also had the Ethiopian tea, which was a delicious homemade tea, and not a Lipton teabag, as I've seen in other Ethiopian restaurants.
Becoming one of my favorite local restaurants the vegetarian menu is well appointed and tasty. I didn't realize that beans and peas could be a comfort food until I started dining here. The service is excellent. I just think that the decor could use a bit of sprucing up. Other than that you can't go wrong here.
Came here for the vegan lunch buffet. The food was fantastic and we thoroughly enjoyed ourselves. It was nice to have so many options on the buffet.That's the downside of flat screen TVs.

Well, of course it's said that this sort of thing never ends well. Those of us pervs who know how to have group sex without turning it into a police matter are more busy doing it than talking about it! (Well, some of us, anyway. I like doing both, meself.)
Plus, it's more socially accepted to talk about the Threesome That Went Horribly Wrong than the Threesome That Totally Rocked. The Threesome That Went Horribly Wrong reaffirms the cultural narrative about how sex is "supposed" to be.

Why do so many "über-straight" guys want to go with two women? Surely you just end up with more holes than you can fill .....
Now, two guys and one girl still leave some holes unfilled, but there are at least more possibilities. Especially if you factor in a strap-on!

I have to say the whole point is
> to see the women kissing
Now please can we have an icon for a cold shower
:: Why do so many "über-straight" guys want to go with two women? ::
If ya gotta ask, you'll never understand.
If ever you need a playmobile reenactment...
Problem solved!
...........that he might have concentrated on keeping his wife happy in bed without "assistance"? As in showing the lady a decent amount of enthusiasm and consideration - consistently? I have to say that if you have to "call in reinforcements" you have rather lost the plot with your other half.
Bit like saying "if you have to use sex toys you've lost the plot" or "if you have to use positions other than missionary you've lost the plot," really. It's not about what you "have" to do, it's about what's fun to do.
You're assuming that the threesome was the husband's idea. That's not neccessarily the case. Speaking as a man married to a bisexual woman I've got to say that it sounds to me like maybe this bloke was in a similar situation. Granted we both believe that exploring the idea of a threesome would be nearly as damaging to our marriage as cheating and so have never done so, but barring that mentality she would be more likely to suggest bringing in a second woman than I would be.
Anon because she'd be pissed at me for outing her otherwise..
You lucky, lucky sod!
At least you can get a bit of peace on a Friday night, wathing the telly!
That reminds me of a comment from the Ex
"Why do women like threesomes" (meaning FMF)
"Because it gives us someone to talk to when the bloke falls asleep"
Nah. She doesn't cheat for the same reason we don't have threesomes. Our marriage is more important to her than whatever woman has caught her eye. The only real advantage over any other married guy I have is that if she catches me checking out another woman she looks also instead of getting mad at me.
Had....oh....wait...
It's a trap that men are easily reeled in by. Your girlfriend will only ever allow you to have a threesome with another girl involved if she has some lesbian tendencies - it's never for your benefit no matter how good it sounds in theory.
I agree with A J Stiles, it's just logical.
...of the time I went into a TV bar in Frankfurt expecting to watch a match. That was definitely the wrong kind of TV. A 'girl' should not have stubble and an Adam's apple.
Paris? Well just because she is always on TV.
...did that guy ever get 1 woman to agree to get knobbed, nevermind 2 of them...
Or wait, is that why he was enraged, because he was engorged but they'd realised he was an ugly f**ckling and decided they'd concentrate on each other.
Ahhh, when the trash go out to play = black comedy.
Did he end up in a Dura Cell?
i hope his cell mate was not Ever Ready

Here is an excerpt:."
This is the reply I left on KABA:
Comment by: Mike Vanderboegh (6/22/2009) This is just so much historical horseshit it cannot be overstated. Collectivists are not deterred by moral suasion -- THEY HAVE NO FRIGGING MORALS and they will kill anybody, ANYBODY, who gets in their way. See George Orwell's comments on pacifism. If the Germans or the Japanese had made it to India, Gandhi would have been food for worms in 24 hours. Collectivism's appetite for those who resist it is insatiable and can only be discouraged by what they fear most-- their own deaths. Anyone who tells you different is selling something.
And here is what I meant by Orwell's comments on pacifism, from The Partisan Review magazine, London, August-September 1942 issue, entitled: ‘Pacifism and the War’
.
.
Gandhi even wrote a pamphlet in 1942 about how the Indians should greet the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere called HOW TO MEET A JAPANESE INVASION by Mirabehn (his female English secretary) and MK Gandhi, 1942. It laid out the ways Indians could "in good conscience" collaborate with the Imperial Japanese Army.

I really wish there was an organization out that which could take donations for provding guns and ammo to the Iranian Greens. I would certainly give them what I could, I would consider it a measure of ensuring and increasing the USA's national security.
Regarding "Without Firing a Single Shot: Voluntaryist Resistance and Societal Defense PART II", by Carl Watner:
The efficacy of a strategy of non-cooperation depends on whether the adversary needs one's cooperation. Sometimes it does, and the strategy can work. Sometimes it doesn't, and the adversary can just kill everyone. Stalin was reported to have once said that "Death settles all questions." Know your adversary.
I recall that Gandhi once explained, it may have been to Margaret Bourke-White, that his non-violence was not a religious position, but a tactic that could work against the British because they were "decent chaps", but would not work against the Russians. Similarly, non-violence worked in the struggle for civil rights for Blacks in the 1960s, because they were about winning the sympathy of the American people, whose vote still counted.
I helped find buses for a freedom ride in 1962, but declined an invitation to come on it, because I was not prepared to take a vow of non-violence. I understood the merit of it: the movement then needed martyrs more than victors. But I was a Texan, the product of a long militia tradition. I could turn my other cheek to an attack on myself, but if others in my vicinity were threated with death or serious injury, my militia training would kick in, and I would start enforcing the law. That would not have worked out well for lawbreakers, even if they were the ones wearing the badges. Especially not well for them.
So the question remains, what is the nature of our adversaries in the struggle for constitutional compliance in the United States today? That is not easy to say, because it could go either way. Mass public demonstrations, such as we see in Iran this week, could either win the support of the majority of Americans, or it could alienate them and turn them against us. Everything depends on how it is sold. My take is that here, as in Iran, non-violence is a good first or second move, but if it doesn't work within a week or two, it is time for the bloodbath. The other side gets two strikes, then it's hang 'em from the lampposts.
Like the Mikado, we've "got a little list, of those who'd not be missed.".
Great post Mike. As usual you see right to the heart of the matter. I have to admit though, it's a little depressing that this would need to be explained to somebody. It's like they are willfully dumb.

Mr. Gross sez: ."
Straw man? STRAW MAN?!? Who did the raped women fight? The children? Let us assume that "an organized, nationwide satyagraha campaign" was waged in both China and India. Do you suppose that that an army which made sport of playing catch with babies on bayonets would act with any restraint if they suffered the slightest loss of face? These people were monsters. Monsters. Can't you get that?
What did the Jews, Gypsies and all the other 11,000,000 who died in the camps do to deserve their fate, huh? WHAT DID THEY DO? who did they provoke? What do you think the response would have been if some German peaceniks had tried to block those trains? More bodies for the ovens is all.
Don't you get it? Principles mean nothing to collectivists. Humanitarian feeling means nothing to collectivists who are carrying out state policy.
Sheesh, get a clue.
And it was right after this massacre, that the true resistance began. Heroes such as Ling Jianfong, AKA the "Night Rider", plus massive organizations such as the Shanghai and Harbin Anti-Fascist networks.
Grand Uncle told me that after the Massacre, the 8th Route Army began to fly the black flag whenever they battled the Japanese
Nanjing was a true tragedy of gun control and despotism. Even before the Japs invaded China, the KMT government made gun ownership a hanging crime, and in Nanjing, which was the KMT's headquarters, the only people who had guns were the KMT enforcers and the Triads. It was truly a criminal empire where the citizens were completely at the mercy of their oppressor. Once the Japanese entered, Nanjing was truly a dry tinderbed, soaked in kerosene and ready to be ignited by a single spark from a steel toed boot.
The Japanese were not deterred by anything except the Chinese broadsword wielded by the hands of the Anti Fascist Guerillas, and the atomic bombs from the B-29s. Last night on Youtube, some people, obviously deranged libtards, left comments on a "Hiroshima" video on how the US is a terrorist country for dropping the bomb on Japan. WAIT A MINUTE! WHAT THE F*CK DID YOU JUST SAY??? If I had heard that comment in a bar or on the street, I SWEAR TO GOD, THERE WILL BE A FIGHT.
Also, I must write this too. The only reason why the British let Gandhi get away with all of his activities with relatively minor response, was because the Brits were just completely exhausted and almost all of their enemy spent fighting the Nazis and repairing the damage inflicted by the Luftwaffe missiles on their city. They were too exhausted to continue holding on to their empire.
If the British hadn't been tired out by WWII, Gandhi would have been reduced to vapor in less than an hour. The Brits were well known for their "anti-protest" activities in India and Burma throughout the 19th and early 20th centuries.
Who was it who wrote that :
'Those who beat their swords into plowshares will plow for those who do not.' ??
Another great post Mike. The problem is in the USA, the people have willfully given up the first half of the second amendment. Until we have the people's militias across the country, there is nothing to stop the colletivists from further theft of our resources. I'm tired of writing my congressmen and senators (all Republicans); it does no good anyway. It didn't stop TARP, illegal immigration, or other massive Federal frauds and it will not stop anything else the tyrants really want. What will stop them is a well organized people's militia.
Problem is we don't know how to do that anymore.
I am Jewish, and I have studied the Holocaust/Shoah extensively. My family lost over 100 to those murderers.
Prior to that, and extending to 1991, all of my father's side of the family was victimized by the Soviets, early on with property seizures (2 1/2 generations of work, of sacrifice, of risk-taking, were stolen in the name of "the people"), and then with an overbearing system that generated terror as its primary product.
My family's experience, and all that I have read in history, tells me that the Nazis, Communists, Fascists, etc. - which is to say, ALL collectivists - don't give a rat's ass about morality as we know and understand it here in the West. They are motivated, like most of humanity, by 2 things: fear and greed, only more so than the average person. Unlike traders in the financial markets, fear and greed when you're dealing with political power mean "death or injury" (for fear) and "power" (for greed). They want power over as many people as they can obtain it, and they have no compunction, no remorse, about who they have to imprison, steal from, terrorize, torture, shoot in the back of the head or otherwise murder in order to obtain it. What stops them - the ONLY thing that stops them - is the naked threat of physically hurting or killing them (that, or else actually killing or wounding them - some don't respond to threats). For them, might makes right...and that's how those who deal with them MUST respond, because they simply won't survive or be even modestly successful unless they do.
Period. End of report.
I laugh when I hear some imbecile say "might does not make right" - but I'm really crying inside at their naive stupidity. Morally, they are correct, of course. However, I don't intend for my gravestone to say "He was right" after I've been murdered by someone that I didn't lift a finger to stop. Not opposing a wrongdoer (whether a person or a regime) with force because "might doesn't make right" would make as much sense as crossing a street when the sign said, "WALK," despite the fact that an 18-wheeler was running the light and barrelling down on me at 60 MPH. "But he had the right of way" is NOT going on my gravestone - I choose to exercise common sense, thank you very much.
Mike and the others on this thread who have stated this position are, IMHO, 100% correct. We in the US of A, who have enjoyed a system of generally good and decent laws, most of which have been enforced over the years as intended, and who have benefitted from a government that generally protects us from outsiders and from rogue elements within our borders, we who have enjoyed the softness and comfort of the Pax Americana of the last 65 years, generally don't appreciate how the real world works. Generally...but some of us do. We may not like it or agree with it, but nonetheless we understand. Those who do not are Lenin's "useful idiots.".
Even Gandhi admitted that his tactics would have failed against anyone except the Brits.

Oh, yeah, and I believe that I also remember that Nanking was declared an open city meaning no resistance was offered.
That worked out real well.
emdfl
..."after forty years...Tibetians"... blah, blah, blah...
Yeah, and how many of them are left from the original population? And how many of their monasteries have been destroyed? Most of Tibet is now lived on by imported Chinese.
Pacifism ONLY works if the ruling class isn't amoral. Otherwise they end up as dog food.
emdfl
In his excellent book "Modern Times," historian Paul Johnson destroys Gandhi on many levels, including the fact that his techniques could only work against imperialists who were not so bad. Stalin, Hitler, Mussolini, Mao, Castro, Pol Pot, Ho Chi Minh, etc. would simply have made him disappear.
MBV is starting to remind me of Reese in the original Terminator movie.
With the enemy being like the cyborg: "will not feel pity or remorse....and simply will not stop".

i remember that story too, though like you memory of title and author escapes me i do remember thinking it was exactly what would have happened under a nazi, or communist occupation annoyed by a pacifist movement.
Excellent analogy, read the book about Nanking.
Mike you are a deeply interesting person to have Nanking on your website.

Don't forget that King Obamarama's mentor once sat around a table with other traitors and calmly discussed the need to kill millions of Americans who coudn't be "re-educated" in the camps after their victory. Non-violence is horse hockey.
I remember reading a book about the Flying Tigers.
It said that the Jappenese used fire bombs on the Chineses wood built cities. And, that after all the bomb were dropped and the cities became raging infernos that they would straff the streets until they ran out of ammo.
None of those cities were military targets, it was a pure terror campaign.
The Imperial Jappanese Empire was about as nasty as they come.
IMO, Statyagraha is a fraud.
India threw Britain out because the British Empire was exhausted, and the British Government, like the French, was chopped off at the knees politically by US policy against "Imperialism".
ML King pretended to use the same techniques, but from the Deacons for Defense, to the Black Panthers, the Nation of Islam, and the increasingly heavy hand of the Federal government, the Civil Rights movement's success was based on force and the threat of force.
The alternate history story about a German invasion of India is The Last Article by Harry Turtledove.
-Daniel Davis
Very interesting stuff, I tend to agree with your stance to a point here!
Here's how resistance is supposed to work:
the elders summoned men from 30 surrounding villages, told them to fetch their weapons (many men in the region own a gun), and launched a “lashkar” — or tribal militia — of more than 1,000 people to drive out the Taleban.
Isn't it awfully nice to be able to produce a militarily-useful firearm when you really need one?
I know this is a very old post but I feel it would be remiss of me to fail to denounce it as a tasteless and spurious appropriation of a horror that is still raw in the minds of millions of living persons. I have no personal connection even to China much less the specific events at Nanjing, and am not squeamish by nature, yet even I find this absolutely ghastly - you demonstrate no sensitivity or gravitas with the subject and come across as just another ranting Internet pinhead unworthy of serious attention, more concerned with ideological vendettas than with real human suffering.
Hyper-individualists are often perceived as callous and arrogant, and you have certainly done nothing to counter that perception here. Please take this post down.Michael Todd Theatre

JRS40… Forty weeks for “Ben-Hur”? Maybe I have a wrong opening or closing date or did the math incorrectly, but I have a much longer duration than 40 weeks for the Michael Todd roadshow run of “Ben-Hur.”
I have a record of all bookings of the Todd (when it became the Michael Todd)from 1958 until it’s closing in 1977. No movie came close to playing there as long as “The Sound of Music.” I would have to check my records to confirm but I am guessing “Ben-Hur” would be the next closest. It played for 40 weeks.
To answer the question posed by Bobby S above – “Around the World in 80 Days” played at the Cinestage from 4/4/57 to 12/25/58.
“The Sound of Music” premiered at the Michael Todd 50 years ago today. With a reserved-seat run of 93 weeks, do you think it is the long-run record holder for this venue?
Also, on a related note, I would like to mention my new 50th anniversary retrospective for “The Sound of Music” can be read here.
1987 Photo
Saw “Star” in 1968 and “Exodus” around 1963. Both movies were reserved seating.
I saw “Around the World in 80 Days” at the Beverly Theatre in Peoria, IL, so I cannot answer BobbyS' question. When I saw “Star!” at the Michael Todd Theatre it was shown on a very wide, crystal-clear, flat screen. If anyone out there has seen the film I believe the beginning of the film was supposed to be a representation of a show curtain in a theatre.
So did “Around the World” play the Michael Todd theater or his Cinestage? I thought it played the Michael Todd with the waterfall curtain. Was it the same size of todays IMAX screens?
When I saw Ben-Hur in 70mm projection at the Michael Todd in 1960 the curtains opened horizontally to reveal a very wide flat screen. Meanwhile, Exodus at the Cinestage was shown on a slightly curved standard screen. The Cinerama strip screen was installed a few years later.
I saw the wide-screen re-release of “Gone With the Wind” at the McVickers on Madison Street in Chicago. The same thing happened in that theatre when Mr. Gable got his first close-up.
In 1967-68 I saw the re-release of “Gone With the Wind” here. I sat in the balcony and the large audience gave Clark Gable a rousing applause upon his first screen entrance. I live in L A now and would be happy to give visitors a tour of our miraculously remaining single screens:
Thanks, Broan! I had not seen the article, nor do I remember the interior extrance of the Michael Todd Theatre looking like this. Here are a couple photos showing Bertrand Goldberg’s remodeling.
Thanks! I’ve never seen what the theatre’s interior looked like originally. As in my earlier comment, it was impossible to determine what the interior looked like due to all of those curtains that ensured that wonderful sound quality. The acoustics must have been pretty good in the Harris era, too.
Here is an interior view.
The one and only time that I was in the Michael Todd Theatre was seeing “Star!” with my parents and a couple of other people on Christmas Day, 1968 (I believe). (The reviews must have come in!) It was not a terribly large theatre; it was kind of like the old Civic Theatre which was connected to Lyric Opera’s building in Chicago which was converted to production space several years ago. The sound and projection were incredible (despite the many flaws of the film). It was impossible to determine what the theatre had looked like before it became a movie theatre due to the curtains which assisted all that lovely sound. And, of course, there was the usual popcorn machine in the lobby stinking up everything. I was out of the area at college from 1971-1975, and when I started working in Chicago I was amazed at the bookings as the road-show era of films had died.
For what it’s worth department: When the complex was first announced in 1920, the names of the theatres were to be the Selwyn and the CHICAGO. The eventual CHICAGO Theatre also went through various planning name changes…the Capitol, to the Ambassador, to, finally, the Chicago.
Timoneill – you are quite correct. I guess I was more referring to when there was still some hope for movie palaces in the city. By the time the Dearborn was opened all of the other palaces were gone save for the Woods and United Artists and those two plus the twin all closed within a year of each other.
Don’t forget the projectionist union’s contract on staffing Chicago theatres. It would cost you alot more to operate those extra screens with the extra projectionists you had to hire.
Oh, contraire………… The Michael Todd WAS twinned in 1986. Here’s what happened: M&R Theatres took over the Michael Todd in 1985 after it was closed for 6 years. They also wanted to take over the next-door Cinestage Theatre, but the owners of that porno palace put up a short fight. Eventually, M&R got both theatres and changed the name to Dearborn Cinemas. The plan was to twin both theatres. M&R did manage to twin the Michael Todd; however, they never got around to the Cinestage. The Cinestage side of the Dearborn Cinemas was occasionally opened, but the Michael Todd twinned side remained open until 1988. The M&R Dearborn Cinemas was a complete failure.
Thanks JRS40, that makes sense. Always wondered why Chicago never did when so many cities even New York had divided downtown palaces in to multiples. Here in Toronto, the former Loew’s Uptown was divided in to 5, the Imperial was divided in to 6 and several others in to twins.
There was talk at one time or another in the 70’s and 80’s of dividing the Chicago, the State Lake or the Oriental. Whenever this was brought up it seemed to be at a time when that particular theater was having financial woes. It was decided, though, that dividing a palace into a multiplex was basically turning one losing theater into several. It also didn’t help that ticket prices were higher in the city plus they had to pay for parking. It would have been a losing proposition all around.
It’s also quite amazing that not ONE of the downtown Loop movie palaces were ever divided up in to multiple cinemas like they were almost everywhere. They all were intact and the same single screen theatres when they subsequently closed. That’s quite extraordinary.
Considering what the Goodman has become, too bad they had to demolish the Woods, Michael Todd and Cinestage. They could have just combined them somehow and now THEY would be the Goodman Theatre. Sort of like Playhouse Square in Cleveland, with the old original theatres in place.

Tell me about yourself. Who are your heroes?
I enjoy going out with friends, playing golf, going for runs and just being outside when I'm not at the lab.
What are your career goals?
I hope to attend graduate school, preferably on the east or west coast, for chemical engineering and then possibly be a professor or go into industry.
How did you become interested in science?
I have always been interested in science growing up. I like to solve problems with rationality and logic, but also be creative and think outside the box which chemical engineering has allowed me to do. Movies, books and school have all helped me become more interested in science as well.
What do you hope the INBRE program will do for you?
I hope the INBRE program will help me really decide if and what I want to go to graduate school for, or if I want to go more to the industry/engineering side of things.
How do you see science evolving over the next 20 years?
I think the medical field will really see some incredible advancements with genomics and sequencing peoples' DNA in the next few decades. We will have the ability to turn off or on specific genes that code for cancers and diseases as well as intelligence, athletic abilities and how we look. It has many benefits but also will be a very controversial issue.

For more than 140 years, Boucheron has been delighting and surprising its public with exquisite jewelry jewelry, their perfumes reflect the same exacting standards and the same passion for beauty. Boucheron considers fragrance to be a natural outgrowth of its style; a unique form of adornment that is every bit as personal as jewelry and fits even more readily into everyday life.
Each jewel-like fragrance is an olfactory gem. The perfumer's work is similar to the jeweler's, and both talents express the quintessence of the art of Boucheron. Indeed, the rare essences that go into the fragrances are treasures of nature, just like precious stones and they are selected with the same care.
As a jeweler-perfumer, Boucheron remains more faithful than ever to its history, the wealth of its heritage and the power of its imagination.I have taken the time to link to some great personal finance blogs that have caught my eye. blogs—typically for very little money, and always much less than you would pay if you purchased it all ready made. Even though I have not had the time to complete even half of the projects that I would like to, I wanted to take the time to share some of the great ideas I have incorporated into our own home. Several are from other bloggers and I’ve taken this opportunity to link to their post that inspired me. A few are from my own ideas (though I am sure I was inspired somewhere along the way from others), and others were suggestions from friends or family.
Please note: these projects have been completed over the last two years and I did not save all of the receipts. Some prices are approximates.
- Tufted Headboard: I wanted to dress up our guest bedroom and provide a place that people can prop their head against. However, I did not want to purchase a bed frame (we do not even have a bed frame aside from the basic metal one). When I came across this DIY headboard, I fell in love! I didn’t even know that you could make your own. I decided to not do the “tufting”, but am very happy with the results nonetheless. For this project we purchased a sheet of plywood ($25), fabric ($15), and foam ($15).
- Origami Crane Mobile: I was inspired by this pinwheel mobile to make one of my own. My sister had lovingly crafted 100 cranes (origami) for my bridal shower two years ago, and they were sitting in a bag in my closet waiting for a purpose in our home. Perfect opportunity! The dowel rods were purchased from a craft store for a few dollars, and I used fishing line from my fishing pole (it’s been dormant in our closet for years now). The mobile has added so much to my creative space!
- Fabric Wall Art: We had very bare walls in our guest room, and I’ve seen the growing trend of using fabric as wall art (also my friend Aurora had shown me some they used in their bedroom—looked really nice!). At a fabric store I was able to find this romantic fabric written in French (could say something very unromantic…I am not really sure) and glued it around a metal frame kit I found at a craft store for a few dollars.
- Made Ceiling Fans look High-End: My friend Helen told me that you can unscrew fan blades and paint them—what a great tip! There were very functional, but pastel-colored ceiling fans in each of our rooms that were completely not our style. Instead of replacing them (a small fortune), I took off each of the blades and spray-painted them a glossy mahogany color. They look fantastic! Total cost was about $16 for the paint. I went a little crazy and even “upgraded” the ceiling fan in our garage.
- Expanded Kitchen Pantry Space: For about $60, we replaced the shelves with wood that we stained a mahogany color. The shelves are now wider than the previous ones, giving us more space. And we reused the shelf liners from the previous owners as they were in great shape.
- Created Succulent Planters: I came across this wonderful idea to use IKEA utensil holders (Asker container—$5.99 each) as succulent planters. We have a window over our sink that gets a decent amount of sunshine, and it turned out to be the perfect spot for these!
- Made Herb Hangers: I have always wanted to hang herbs in our kitchen, but couldn’t figure out the best way to do so. While shopping at IKEA a year ago I found these little brushed nickel bathroom hooks for towels and such (a few dollars each). Paul installed them on a lip underneath our cabinets, and I used thread and little wooden paper clips (thank you Vickie!) to hold the herbs. Paul’s mother has kept us in good supply with fresh rosemary—thank you!
- Created a Jewelry Holder: I saw this fantastic jewelry holder idea from Real Simple Living magazine and made a copy of it myself. Forutnately I had a bulletin board on hand that I got free from my last company (they periodically gave items away they no longer wanted), and I had curtains from my old apartment right out of college. I used the curtains as fabric for the board, and purchased a gold/metallic paint to paint the frame. Then I purchased colorful pins, and hung the piece of art in my closet!
Projects on My Can’t-Wait-To-Do-List
- Small Space Garden DIY Pallet: I love vertical gardening, and think this is an awesome way to reuse pallets. Why pay $20-$30 or more for a structure to hang things on when you can just make one yourself? Heck, why not make some pallet bookshelves why you are at it?
- Roman Shades: I pictured gorgeous (but expensive) roman shades in our kitchen, and now it appears that I can make it happen with some sweat equity and fabric!
- Love Map: This is such an adorable way to commemorate your partner and your history together. Just not sure where we will hang it…
I have many other projects on my list, but I would like to focus on just a few in the coming months instead of overwhelming myself.
I would love for you to share your own DIY successes in the comments below! What do you hope to accomplish around your home over the next few months?Future unclear for see-through cans
New York
A California-based beveragemaker hopes consumers will get a kick out of its new see-through plastic cans and expand its share of the $40 billion soft-drink industry. Original New York Seltzer Company, which traces it roots to the streets of Brooklyn but is now based in Walnut, Calif., is testing 12-ounce plastic cans this summer in the Detroit area.
``We feel it's a package that shows off the character and quality of our products,'' said Bruce Sweyd, chief operating officer for New York Seltzer, whose sales amounted to about $100 million last year.
The test is also important for Petainer Development Company, the Atlanta-based concern whose pilot plant can produce up to 100 million cans a year with polyethylene terephthalate, a plastic also known as PET. Petainer wants a better reading on its chances for denting the $6.5 billion market that metal dominates in soft-drink and beer cans.
Lars Emilson, chief executive of Petainer, said he is hoping for ``peaceful coexistence between packages,'' but expects a reaction from aluminum-can makers if plastic proves popular with consumers.
Plastic cans are, at the moment, more expensive to produce than metal cans, and concerns have been raised about whether they will be recycled effectively. Mr. Emilson said he expects that the cost of making plastic cans will fall as production moves past the pilot stage and into mass production. Petainer and New York Seltzer have taken steps to ensure that the plastic cans are recycled. One of the reasons they chose Detroit for the test was that Michigan has a container deposit law. Container Recycling Company, based in Romulus, Mich., near Detroit, has agreed to handle the plastic cans.
Critics, however, ask what would happen if plastic cans were sold in states without deposit laws and question whether there are enough uses for recycled PET plastic to make recycling sound on a larger scale. They also point out that although the Petainer cans have plastic bodies, they have aluminum lids that may complicate recycling. ``Recyclability is a big issue,'' said Louis Umsted, vice chairman of American National Can Co. ``It's fine that they have a recycler to participate in the test run, but what if they put 6 billion cans in there?''02-28-2014
Yesterday was Polar Bear Day….so, the only Polar Bear joke I know. At the North Pole, a young polar bear asks his father, "Dad, am I a polar bear?" His dad replies "Well son, I am a polar bear, your mom is a polar bear. Your grandfather and your grandmother are polar bears. So yes, you are 100% polar bear. Why do you ask?" The young polar bear replies -- "Because I'm REALLY cold!"Denton police are seeking the public’s help in locating a person they say is impersonating a police officer.
At 2:10 a.m. Friday, police said, a woman was stopped on Airport Road by what she thought was a police vehicle using emergency lights. While getting her insurance and driver’s license information, the male driver of the vehicle tried to attack her, according to a news release from the police department.
Ryan Grelle, police spokesman, said that the woman was able to fight back and cause the man to “run back to his vehicle and drive away.”
Since the area where the woman was driving was dark, police said she was unable to describe the man or his vehicle in detail. The news release states he was wearing dark clothing and his vehicle had a red and blue light bar.
Police urge drivers to proceed to a well lit area or the police department and call 911 if they are leery of who might be pulling them over.
If anyone has information about the incident or was in the area at the time it occurred, they are asked to call Sgt. Bobby Smith at 940-349-7971 or send a text message with the information to Tip411.Fairburn Townhouses Apartments400 Fairburn Rd SW, Atlanta, GA 30331 View On Map (404) 696-0540

Not sure how fast something that is basically custom made for you should take but enough people think that my waif is too long that I am trying to bring it down. At least im not at the 12 weeks I was when doing it myself! -Tim
I feel for ya', Tim. If i lived closer i'd be over there helping.....M
I'm happy waiting for what I believe will be a quality custom product from you. :) But, I do agree with you that a 3 week wait time is a good goal to reach. I think that's a good wait time considering the custom nature of the product and I think it will drive in more business for you. just my thoughts.
Talking to my guys it looks like I will get more work this week than the last few so I am hoping they get us caught up. -Tim
Matt, I thought I was bad with my waiting for my MLD stuff.
I'd love to see some additional non-commercial photos of the Revelation quilts. Who has some?Thanks! down
Thanks Travis!
Edited by Found on 03/11/2012 22:58:42 MDT.
Those pics are making me drool. Can't wait until mine gets here! :) Yesterday was the 1 month mark, if it gets here by the middle of next week, there's a possibility I'll take it out next weekend (though, it'll be unnecessarily warm with the weather we've had)
Edited by onefatsurfer on 03/12/2012 13:58:06 MDT.
My quilt has arrived and I am definitely satisfied with my purchase. I ordered the 30 degree Revelation with overfill and it came in exactly at the estimated weight of 22 oz. Cords to cinch the quilt around me would add .5 oz for all 3. It is hard to believe the loft this thing has! It may be too warm...
Heath, You can adjust the down to accommodate different temps; at least in theory. I haven't tried it yet. Lay the quilt flat and pat the down in the direction you want to move it. I can literally move almost all of the down out of the center baffles in 20 seconds, and have it all back in another 20. It's kinda cool, actually.
That is cool! I liked the idea of karo baffles when I was looking at different models of quilts. I really think that I made a good decision with this quilt. I'll know at the end of the month :) Sad part is that I was able to open the box, weigh the quilt, and of course test out the size. After that, I had to head to the airport. Oh well. At least it didn't arrive after I left and then I had to wonder for a few more days

Just a quick unsolicited ad for Tim's products - my Epiphany K has now seen almost 50 nights in the field, all the way down to zero many times, and I have been thrilled with it. It is absolutely a 'go to' part of my gear, and I'm one VERY satisfied customer.Thanks Tim-DT
So glad we can provide designs that do what nothing else can do. And wicked happy when they work the way we know they can for you guys out in the field. Dave's epiphany-k is exactly the same as our current epiphany incase anyone was wondering which of the 3 generations he was referring to. -Tim
I really only need to scrounge like 75 more dollars to purchase one of these bad boys. You don't anticipate any cease in production anytime soon eh?Can't wait to sleep like a king.
Cease in production, nope. Those days are behind us. That was when I was working alone doing everything and when I got overwhelmed I'd have to take a break from orders to catch up. Now we have a large team working every day to build quilts at a rate I never could have. I did 120 quilts the two years before the Sanborn merge in oct. since then weve had over 200 orders and are currently shipping at about 4 weeks out (unless your name rhymes with RAT HAIRY). So no, our production won't be stopping any time soon, as long as I am still alive is all it takes at this point.-Tim

Poor. »Hi,.
In the murky, mysterious world of mergers and acquisitions, companies and their bankers and financial advisers tend to operate far below the radar — only surfacing to leak the news in The Wall Street Journal that a deal is close at hand.
Not this time. While the Journal did get the tip-off back in December, the Times on Wednesday simply issued a press release inviting all comers to take a look at the stake. Not only that, the Times published the name of the Goldman Sachs banker handling the sale, along with his phone number. Usually, as a reporter, you have to cash in lots of chips to get digits like that.
Why do it this way? Because no one bit when they did it in the usual way. That means the NYT’s price for the stake either will come down, or it will have to wait a while until it finds someone who shares its conception of what the stake must be worth. (We’ve heard all sorts of numbers, but $200 million seems like one that analysts could agree on. It could go lower from there.)

5 thoughts on “Ebooks Are not Electronic Journals”
Ebrary is a new one to me, hard to keep up with this industry. Good to know.
Absolutely! Here’s a different take on ebooks.
That is also our experience with virtually all users … I will make exceptions for edited Wiley e-books which offer chapter downloads. The other user complaint about e-books is that they often need to use several books at one sitting.
You might try having your ebooks as patron-driven (demand-driven). You might find that these same scientists will use the ebooks if they are there–we certainly have found that out. Or you can purchase more ebooks directly from the publishers so you get PDFs and not the page limits. Surveys aren’t a substitute for real-life use of ebooks.
Scott – we have DDA, but I decided to leave that out of the blog post in the interest of brevity. And, just to get it out of the way, weknow how much our ebooks are being used.
My survey was based on trying to figure out why our patrons were complaining about the ebooks. Let me clarify – scientists complaining about the ebooks acquired through DDA. The real-life use of ebooks reported to me has been one of universal complaint, so my survey was trying to figure out who DID want ebooks and why. It turns out around 20% of those polled preferred an ebook in all cases (these are chemists btw). Since we cannot identify the patrons triggering DDAs, no one knows exactly why any particular ebook is triggered. In any case, most DDA ebooks tend to not get much repeat use. My only theory is that they are acquired for an immediate need that not many others share. But for the record we have tens of thousands of ebooks and given the university’s commitment to DDA, I’m willing to let those who love the ebrary platform pick the materials for it. As for my purchases, I’m trying to serve those patrons who cannot automatically order a book on their preferred platform. And let’s be clear, if the ebooks from ebrary were like Springer’s or Wiley’s, most of my patrons would be fully delighted.
The specific incident which led to me thinking about ebooks was a student asking me to get a physical book although we had the ebook. After talking to him and looking at the order data of the DDA, we figured out he had triggered the DDA – even though he hates ebooks. DDA is a black box – after the initial order you cannot rationally argue that any following use is done by choice or preference unless you have a physical copy, which is a non-starter budget-wise.'Tip of the energy iceberg:' Solar panels will save AFA $1 million annually

The Myth that U.S. Has Never Defaulted On Its Debt
Posted By Washingtons Blog On October 15, 2013 @ 1:30 am In Credit,Think Tank | Comments Disabled
Some people argue that countries can’t default. But that’s false [1].
It is widely stated that the U.S. government has never defaulted. However, that is also a myth.
Catherine Rampbell reports [2] [3] related to the repayment of gold-based obligations.
Donald Marron points out [5] at Forbes:
The United States defaulted on some Treasury bills in 1979 (ht: Jason Zweig [6]). And it paid a steep price for stiffing bondholders.
Terry Zivney and Richard Marcus describe the default in The Financial Review [7]…: [8] to constitute a partial default. For example, University of Massachusetts at Amherst economics professor Gerald Epstein notes [9]: [10] [11] at the Mises Institute that the U.S. defaulted on its:

"Bad enough they only give you one number--that toll-free information line," sputters an Orange County taxpayer, "but then just try to get through!"
In fact, the IRS thinks it has taken care of this problem with its one-number system, meant to handle almost all calls for information or help.

PHOENIX - Authorities say a rollover crash involved a news vehicle Tuesday morning in downtown Phoenix.
The rollover happened around 10:30 a.m. at Van Buren and 12th streets.
A KPNX Channel 12 News SUV was part of the wreck with two people in the vehicle, said Phoenix fire spokesman Larry Nunez.
Phoenix police Sgt. Trent Crump said a black SUV was traveling north on 12th Street and failed to yield at a stop sign before making a left turn onto Van Buren Street.
The SUV then ran into the passenger side of the 12 News SUV, forcing the news vehicle into oncoming traffic, Crump said.
Kim Covington with 12 News was transported in stable condition, according to Phoenix police Sgt. Trent Crump.
A photographer in the vehicle at the time was not hurt but went to the hospital with Covington, said Crump.
Phoenix police said Van Buren Street was closed from 7th Street and 16th Street in both directions while crews worked to clear the scene.Hopefully you already know about Cliff Reid‘s fantastic website Resus.ME — Resuscitation Medical Education. Here is how Cliff introduces the website:

Tomlinson said on NFL Network Thursday that he would like to play in the 2012 season, but he’s not sure whether any team will be interested in the services of a running back who turns 33 in June and gained just 280 yards last year.
“I’m not sure, but I do want to continue to play,” Tomlinson said. “I love the game, no question, but I have to wait on the opportunity. The ball’s in the teams’ court. I’m just here waiting to see what happens. I’ll have a conversation with my agent, Tom Condon, in the next week or so, trying to get an idea of what teams think about me.”
So what can Tomlinson provide to a team that signs him to a free-agent contract? Leadership is the obvious answer, given that Tomlinson is one of the most respected players in the NFL, but Tomlinson doesn’t want people to overlook what he can bring on the field.
“I think the leadership in the locker room, on the field, being able to really help the younger guys out,” Tomlinson said. “I still think I have something to bring in that respect, but also on the field: I think I’m still a viable option out of the backfield, especially in sub packages. I think I do really well in running routes and creating mismatches.”
Tomlinson caught 42 passes for 449 yards and averaged a career-high 10.7 yards a catch last season, so he may be right when he says he still has something left as a receiver. There aren’t many 33-year-old running backs in the NFL, but if Tomlinson is motivated to keep playing, there’s probably some team that could use him.5.18.2010
NEW!! Mary J. Blige Launches Sunglasses Line
Truth be told, Mary J. Blige could come out with a line of bedding and we'd love it. She's so gorgeous and strong and regal and raw. Both her perfume and collaboration with Gucci and Degree were big hits in our book.
As we reported in April, her latest venture is a line of sunglasses called "Melodies by MJB." But this isn't your typical celebrity-endorsed product line. The designs are each significant to Mary J. Blige on a personal level; each of the four styles will represent a facet of the singer's life. The line, which will feature four styles in twenty color options, will debut in Fall 2010.
"Melodies by MJB" is the second celebrity brand developed and supported by Jimmy Iovine, the head of Interscope who also helped launch the popular "Beats by Dr. Dre" headphones. Jimmy predicts that Mary J. Blige's line of sunglasses will be a huge success, already planning for a second collection in Spring 2011.
Are you excited about this launch, Glamazons? I sure am. Mary J. Blige is the sunglasses Queen and I remember buying the white shades she wore on the Share My World cover just because she rocked them! She's always been something of a trendsetter so a line of sunglasses is a logical progression.
Would you wear them?
Kisses,

I did a piece on Alex Okafor earlier today which you can check out by clicking here.
Arizona State defensive tackle Will Sutton has decided to stay at ASU for his senior season.
— Doug Haller (@DougHaller) January 8, 2013
There aren’t a ton of options for Seattle if they want to use the draft to find a three technique. The two best options (Sheldon Richardson, Star Lotulelei) will both be long gone as early first round picks. Sylvester Williams may also be a top-25 pick. I’m going to take a closer look at Kawann Short and Bennie Logan over the next fortnight. Logan opted to turn pro this week.
Sutton was never going to be a first round pick, but he would’ve been in contention as a mid-round target. It looks increasingly like the best way for the Seahawks to solve this problem will be in free agency.
Knowing Schneider the best way for them to solve the 3-tech problem will be to draft a WR in the seventh round and convert him over a few weeks into a DT…
You know I wouldn’t be surprised.
Here you go:
How about a fitness trainer for DE, LEO backup?
Paging Randy Starks, paging Randy Starks…
Wow, that’s a shame.
He looks real good, but raw. I saw him line up 3, 4, & 5tech throughout this game. Even lined up on punt team. Played NT too on three man rush. Pay attention on 3:55, 6:15, 7:20, 8:09 for his bull rushes.
At 0:46sec mark, pulling LG was suppose to block Sutton, with the RG shifting left as was the C and LT. He instead goes to outside protection and leaving Sutton free shot at QB. Watch how fast this kid shoots through that gap. Dude has a gnarly swim move too.
Do I hear ” and with the 32nd pick in the 2013 nfl draft, the Seattle Seahwks select ….. Wide Reciever out of the university of…..”
Rutgers… Please say Rutgers.
RT Menelik Watson declares for draft from FSU. I’ve followed him for quite some time due to his interest in attending UW and his unique back story.
DO NOT be surprised if this guy goes very high in the draft. DO NOT be surprised if he’s in serious consideration by SEA in the first few rounds.
What he brings: He is a huge human being who moves like he weighs 100 LBs less than his actual weight. Former basketball player from the UK with a ridiculous ceiling. He will put on the most impressive combine you will ever see from an OL, including Bruce Campbell from a few years back (expect legit 4.7s yes, that crazy). That said, the kid can play despite limited experience. From all accounts, his work ethic is off the charts and brings a very rugged attitude to the trenches. Even better (in SEA’s case) he has actually played RT.
Now, I’m not one of those people who is dying for OL high in the draft, but this kid has special upside/ability. He’s rough now, but his ceiling is unparalleled. I personally think we need to look at other positions, but this is a kid I could get on board with due to his insane athletic ability & work ethic. Imagine PC and Cable working with this “piece of clay.”
Just an FYI, as right now, his announcement will not be as noticed, but over the next few months, you will hear about this kid.
Thanks for the heads up on this guy.
We have the same stance on the OL going forward, but he might be an exception to this staff. Mean guy, insane athlete, great work ethic. Could see him appealing to PC/JS/Cable.
*I sound like I am his agent talking him up, but he is a special athlete. Curious to see your take on him (knowing he’s new to football and the OL).
I’ll check him out. Got the Bowl game saved.
Hey Rob
I have a couple questions if you don’t mind.
if the hawks trade up (which is unlikely as they love to save picks) and are in a position to get the Missouri D-lineman i wanna say Richardson or Ogletree, who do you think would be a better pick up? just wondering it doesn’t seem likely but i love to speculate.
Also Brandon Coleman, i am very interested in him as a hawks pick, 6’6 225 with speed def a good prospect. what are some things you think he’d need to work on if there is any? i watched as much of the Rutgers bowl game as i could but it turned into what seemed like a Defensive battle, was his not so good play due to lack of a better QB? and is Wilson someone that could help him become a better player? and vice versa
hope that’s understandable i tend to Ramble.
Hey David thanks for the questions.
Richardson fills the bigger need, but Ogletree has just incredible upside. It’d be a tough call. I think you go Richardson just because him being effective would take this defense to the next level. But Ogletree is the best linebacker I’ve scouted so far.
Coleman needs to work on consistency. He has the occasional drop. He can run crisper routes and I think he also do a better job using his size to high point the football. If he jumps up and reaches out, not many DB’s are going to get to the football. It’s a technique thing on those jump balls. He has tremendous upside though and could be a monster at the next level. The QB situation at Rutgers is terrible – and it’s why I think he should declare. Put him on an offense with a guy like Russell Wilson and he could dominate.Health Care Lawyers and Law Firms in Gulf Park Estates, MS

The 344th military police company, an Army Reserve unit out of Middletown, is on its way to deployment in Afghanistan. Their mission will be to provide training and support for the operations of the Afghan prison system.
Many of the 121 soldiers work in corrections or law enforcement as civilians. Their sendoff was Saturday afternoon at the State Armory in Hartford.
The troops’ first stop is Fort Bliss, Texas, for additional training.
Senator Blumenthal and Lt. Gov.

As the Yale cosmologist Dr. Beatrice Tinsley once wrote, "I think I am tied to the idea of expanding forever.". 37 "There would be a lot of things about the universe that we simply couldn't predict," said Dr. Thomas Banks, a physicist at the University of California at Santa Cruz.." Einstein's Last Laugh Until about four years ago, an overwhelming preponderance of astronomers subscribed to the view that the cosmic expansion was probably slowing down because of the collective gravity of the galaxies and everything else in the universe, the way a handful of stones tossed in the air gradually slow their ascent. The only question was whether the universe had enough gravitational oomph to stop expanding and bring itself back together in a "big crunch," or whether the galaxies would sail ever more slowly outward forever. It was to measure that rate of slowing of this outward flight, and thus find the long-sought and elusive answer to the cosmic question, that two teams of astronomers started competing projects in the 1990's using distant exploding stars, supernovas, as cosmic beacons. In 1998 the two teams announced that instead of the expected slowing, the galaxies actually seem to have speeded up over the last five or six billion years, as if some "dark energy" was pushing them outward. "It's definitely the strangest experimental finding since I've been in physics," Dr. Witten said. "People find it difficult to accept. I've stopped expecting that the finding will be proved wrong, but it's an extremely uncomfortable result." To astronomers this dark energy bears a haunting resemblance to an idea that Albert Einstein had back in 1917 and then abandoned, later calling it his biggest blunder. In that year he inserted a mathematical fudge factor that came to be known as the cosmological constant into his equations of general relativity in order to stabilize the universe against collapse; Einstein's constant acted as a kind of cosmic repulsion to balance the gravitational pull of the galaxies on one another. 38 Einstein gave up the cosmological constant after the American astronomer Edwin Hubble discovered that the universe was expanding and thus did not need stabilizing. But his fudge factor refused to die. It gained a new identity with the advent of quantum mechanics, the bizarre-sounding rules that govern the subatomic realm. According to those rules, empty space is not empty, but rather foaming with energy. Inserted into Einstein's equations, this energy would act like a cosmological constant, and try to blow the universe apart. According to astronomers the recently discovered dark energy now accounts for about two-thirds of the mass of the universe. But is this Einstein's old fudge factor, the cosmological constant, come home to roost -- in which case the universe will accelerate eternally? Or is the presumed acceleration only temporary, driven by one of the many mysterious force fields, dubbed quintessence, allowed by various theories of high energy physics? Or is the acceleration even real? "It's important to find out if the cosmological constant is really constant," said Dr. Witten. Because the repulsive force resides in space itself, as the universe grows, the push from dark energy grows as well. "If dark energy is the cosmological constant then it is a property of the vacuum that will always be with us, getting more powerful as the universe gets bigger and the universe will expand forever," explained Dr. Adam Riess of the Space Telescope Science Institute in Baltimore. But if the dark energy is some form of quintessence, "then there may be more such fields which arise in the future, possibly of the opposite sign, and then all bets are off for the future of the universe." Dr. Krauss said, "The good news is that we can't prove that this is the worst of all possible universes." The Long Goodbye It might seem strange or presumptuous for astronomers to try to describe events all the way to the end of time when physicists are still groping for a "theory of everything." But to Dr. Krauss, this is testimony to the power of ordinary physics. "We can still put ultimate limits on things without even knowing the ultimate theory," he said. "We can put limits on things based on ordinary physics." Dr. Dyson said his venture into eschatology was inspired partly by a 1977 paper on the future of an ever expanding universe by Dr. J. N. Islam, now at the University of Chittagong in Bangladesh, in The Quarterly Journal of the Royal Astronomical Society. Dr. Dyson was also motivated, he wrote in his paper, to provide a counterpoint to a famously dour statement by Dr. Steven Weinberg, who wrote in his book "The First Three Minutes," "The more the universe seems comprehensible, the more it also seems pointless." 39 Dr. Dyson wrote, "If Weinberg is speaking for the 20th century, I prefer the 18th." If the present trend of acceleration continues this is the forecast: In about two billion years Earth will become uninhabitable as a gradually warming Sun produces a runaway greenhouse effect. In five billion years the Sun will swell up and die, burning the Earth to a crisp in the process. At about the same time the Milky Way will collide with its twin the Andromeda galaxy, now about two million light-years away and closing fast, spewing stars, gas and planets across intergalactic space. Any civilization that managed to survive these events would face a future of increasing ignorance and darkness as the accelerating cosmic expansion rushes most of the universe away from us. "Our ability to know about the universe will decrease with time," said Dr. Krauss. "The longer you wait, the less you see, the opposite of what we always thought." As he explains it, the disappearance of the universe is a gradual process. The faster a galaxy flies away from us, the dimmer and dimmer it will appear, as its light is "redshifted" to lower frequencies and energies, the way a police siren sounds lower when it is receding. When it reaches the speed of light, the galaxy will appear to "freeze," like a dancer caught in midair in a photograph, in accordance to Einstein's theory of relativity, and we will never see it get older, said Dr. Abraham Loeb, an astronomer at Harvard. Rather it will simply seem dimmer. The farther away an object is in the sky, he said, the younger it will appear as it fades out of sight. "There is a finite amount of information we can collect from the universe," Dr. Loeb said. About 150 billion years from now almost all of the galaxies in the universe will be receding fast enough to be invisible from the Milky Way. The exceptions will be galaxies that are gravitationally bound to the cloud of galaxies, known as the Local Group, to which the Milky Way belongs. Within this cloud, life would look much the same at first. There would be galaxies in the sky. "When you look at the night the stars will still be there," said Dr. Krauss. "To the astronomer who wants to see beyond, the sky will be sadly empty. Lovers won't be disturbed -- scientists will be." But about 100 trillion years from now, when the interstellar gas and dust from which new stars condense is finally used up, new stars will cease to be born. From that time on, the sky will grow darker and darker. The galaxies themselves, astronomers say, will collapse in black holes within about 1030 years. But even a black hole is not forever, as Dr. Stephen Hawking, the Cambridge University physicist and best-selling author, showed in path-breaking calculations back in 1973. Applying the principles of quantum mechanics to these dread-sounding objects, Dr. Hawking discovered that a black hole's surface, its so-called event horizon, would fluctuate and exude energy in the form of random bursts of particles and radiation, growing hotter and hotter until the black hole eventually exploded and vanished. Black holes the mass of the sun would take 1064 years to explode. For black holes the mass of a galaxy those fireworks would light up space-time 1098 years from now. 40 Against the Fall of Night Will there be anything or anyone around to see these quantum fireworks? Dr. Dyson argued in his 1979 paper that life and intelligence could survive the desert of darkness and cold in a universe that was expanding infinitely but ever more slowly by adopting ever slower and cooler forms of existence. Intelligence, could reside, for example, in the pattern of electrically charged dust grains in an interstellar cloud, a situation described in the 1957 science fiction novel "The Black Cloud," by the British astronomer Sir Fred Hoyle, who died in August. As an organism like the black cloud cooled, he argued, it would think more slowly, but it would always metabolize energy even more slowly, so its appetite would always be less than its output. In fact, Dr. Dyson concluded, by making the amount of energy expended per thought smaller and smaller the cloud could have an infinite number of thoughts while consuming only a finite amount of energy. But there was a hitch. Even just thinking requires energy and generates heat, which is why computers have fans. Dr. Dyson suggested that creatures would have to stop thinking and hibernate periodically to radiate away their heat. In an accelerating universe, however, there is an additional source of heat that cannot be gotten rid of. The same calculations that predict black holes should explode also predict that in an accelerating universe space should be filled with so-called Hawking radiation. In effect, the horizon -- the farthest distance we can see -- looks mathematically like the surface of a black hole. The amount of this radiation is expected to be incredibly small -- corresponding to a fraction of a billionth of a billionth of a billionth of a degree above absolute zero, but that is enough to doom sentient life. "The Hawking radiation kills us because it gives a minimum temperature below which you cannot cool anything," said Dr. Krauss. Once an organism cools to that temperature, he explained, it would dissipate energy at some fixed rate. "Since there is a finite total energy, this means a finite lifetime." Infinity on Trial Although Dr. Dyson agrees with this gloomy view of life in an accelerating universe, he and Dr. Krauss and Dr. Starkman are still arguing about whether life is also doomed in a universe that is not accelerating, but just expanding and getting slower and colder. Quantum theory, the Case Western authors point out, limits how finely the energy for new thoughts can be shaved. The theory decrees that energy is emitted and absorbed in tiny indivisible lumps called "quanta." Any computation must spend at least this much energy out of a limited supply. Each new thought is a step down an energy ladder with a 41 finite number of steps. "So you can only have a finite number of thoughts," said Dr. Krauss. "If you want to stare at your navel and not think any new thoughts, you won't dissipate energy, " he explained. But that would be a boring way to spend eternity. If life is to involve more than the eternal reshuffling of the same data, he and Dr. Starkman say, it cannot be eternal. Dr. Dyson, however, says this argument applies only to so-called digital life, in which there is a fixed number of quantum states. Creatures like the black cloud, which could grow along with the universe, he said, would have an increasing number of quantum states, and so there would always be more rungs of the ladder to step down. So the bottom need never be reached and life and thought could go on indefinitely. But nobody knows whether such a life form can exist, said Dr. Krauss. Compared with the sight of the World Trade Center towers collapsing or the plight of a sick child, this future extinction may seem a remote concern. Dr. Allan Sandage, an astronomer at Carnegie Observatories in Pasadena, Calif., who has spent his life investigating the expansion and fate of the universe, said: "Life on this earth is going to vanish in 4.5 billion years. I wouldn't get hung up on the fact that the lights are all going out in 30 billion years." Dr. Dyson said he was still an optimist. It is too soon to start panicking, he counseled in an e-mail message. The observations could be wrong. "At present all possibilities are open," he wrote. "The recent observations are important, not because they answer the big questions about the history of the universe, but because they give us new tools with which to explore the history." Even in an accelerating universe, Dr. Dyson said, humans or their descendants might one day be able to rearrange the galaxies and save more of them from disappearing. Another glimmer of hope comes from the deadly and chilling Hawking radiation itself, said Dr. Raphael Bousso, from the Institute of Theoretical Physics at the University of California at Santa Barbara. Since that radiation is produced by unpredictable quantum fluctuations, he pointed out, if you wait long enough anything can appear in it, even a new universe. "Sooner or later one of those quantum fluctuations will look like a Big Bang," he said. In that case there is the possibility of a future, if not for us, at least for something or somebody. In the fullness of time, after all, physics teaches that the improbable and even the seemingly impossible can become the inevitable. Nature is not done with us yet, nor, as Dr. Dyson indicates, are we necessarily done with nature. We all die, and it is up to us to decide who and what to love, but, as Dr. Weinberg pointed out in a recent article in The New York Review of Books, there is a certain nobility in that."

Mitt Romney Delivers Strong Victory Speech in Florida Hammering President Barack Obama – Complete Video 1/31/12

Here is complete video of Newt Gingrich delivering a defiant speech in the wake of a distant second place finish to Mitt Romney in the Florida GOP Presidential Primary.
Gingrich never congratulated Romney on his victory in Florida, but instead made it clear he intends to fight Romney in every state. Gingrich supporters held up signs that said, “46 states to go.” He said he would run a campaign “of the people, by the people, for the people,” and that in the end, “people power” would triumph over “money power.”
He also spent a good deal of time describing what he would do his first day as President. From this speech, you would never know he just lost a primary race by a wide margin. He certainly made it clear he won’t leave the race anytime soon.

Here is video of Rick Santorum speaking tonight from Nevada after finishing third in the Florida GOP Presidential Primary. Santorum urged voters to reject the negativity of both the Gingrich and Romney Campaigns and choose his campaign that he promised will make Barack Obama the issue.

CNN and Fox News just projected Gov. Mitt Romney as the winner of the Florida Primary. The polls are now closed in the entire state, and Romney’s lead in votes already counted from the precincts that closed an hour ago is fluctuating between 17-20%. Romney is getting right at 50% of the vote. If he winds up getting between 45%-50% of the final vote, it will be a huge night, indeed, for Mitt Romney.

Here is video of Mitt Romney’s closing web ad for the Florida Primary tomorrow. The ad urges voters, “Tomorrow, stand with Mitt.” In the ad, Romney says:
“I’m looking forward to debating Barack Obama. I’m not going to worry about the crowd. I’m going to make sure we tell the truth to Barack Obama and get him out of the White House.”

Here is video of Newt Gingrich Campaign Spokesman R.C. Hammond sparring with Utah GOP Rep. Jason Chaffetz – a supporter of Mitt Romney. Chaffetz has apparently been following the Gingrich Campaign and showing up at events. Hammond apparently spotted Chaffetz and decided to approach him and ask him some questions.
THE HILL: Rep. Jason Chaffetz (R-Utah) found his own tactics turned against him during a Newt Gingrich event here Friday afternoon.
Chaffetz, a Mitt Romney supporter, has been turning up at Gingrich events during the past two days, though he denied in a brief interview with The Hill that he was doing so in order to goad the former Speaker. He said he was merely there to “offer some perspective.”
But Gingrich spokesman R.C. Hammond decided it was time to do some goading of his own, as he briefed reporters. Hammond first waved with faux-glee at the Utah congressman and invited him to join the briefing. When Chaffetz ignored him, the spokesman instead marched the press over to where Chaffetz was standing with fellow Romney supporter Bay Buchanan. . . . 
Nerves are clearly getting frayed. I don’t think either camp comes off looking very good with stuff like this.

Two new polls out today show Gov. Mitt Romney with a nine point lead over Newt Gingrich in Florida. The Florida Primary will take place on Tuesday, January 31.
Both Quinnipiac and Sunshine State News put Romney ahead of Gingrich, 38%-29% and 40%-31% respectively. In both polls, Rick Santorum and Ron Paul are way back around the 10% mark. Romney’s two debate performances this week have really turned the momentum in his favor.
Romney now holds a 7.1 point lead over Gingrich in our 3-Day Average of Polls.
Two New Polls Show Mitt Romney Now Up by Nine in Florida over Newt Gingrich – 1/27/12
The final GOP Presidential Debate in Florida just ended, and it was a very strong night for Mitt Romney and Rick Santorum.
Romney was aggressive once again, and really went after Newt Gingrich early in the debate. Gingrich again did not really seem ready for the hits and did not return fire in equal proportion to the attacks he received. Gingrich needed to land a knockout blow on Romney in this debate, and he just did not do it. He had some good moments, particularly on the need to support Israel, but he did not have a moment to help him recapture his momentum.
I thought Rick Santorum did very well, and actually put Romney on the defensive for awhile on RomneyCare. But Romney handled those attacks as well as he possibly can, and it was probably enough to keep it from doing him any serious harm in Florida. Santorum spoke very eloquently on a number of questions, and gave a great answer summing up the truth that our rights come from the “Creator” as it says in the Declaration of Independence. He further explained that Government does not exist under our Constitution to give rights to Americans, but rather to protect those God-given rights that it has no power or authority to take away.
Ron Paul had some very good moments too. He provided a good contrast to the back-and-forth between Gingrich and Romney, as did Rick Santorum.
Mitt Romney had a lot of momentum coming into this debate, and I suspect he will maintain it coming out of the debate. Gingrich did nothing to derail him, and Santorum is so far back in the polls, I doubt his strong performance here will boost him enough to give him a chance to actually win Florida. In fact, Santorum is not going to be in Florida on Election night, Tuesday, and he is not going to spend money running ads in Florida (he just said that on CNN after the debate). That does not convey that he believes he has any real chance in Florida.
If I had to give grades, I would say: Romney – A-; Santorum – A-; Paul – B; Gingrich – C. Romney and Santorum were “Winners,” Paul held his own, and Gingrich lost by not doing what he needed to do to turn the momentum in Florida.

Rasmussen is out with a new Florida Poll this morning that leaves little doubt as to a major swing in favor of Mitt Romney there. The new poll has Romney leading Newt Gingrich by 8 points 39%-31%, a major turnaround from the previous Rasmussen survey conducted in Florida on Sunday, just after Gingrich had won the South Carolina Primary. Gingrich had moved to a 9 point lead 41%-32% in that poll.
RASMUSSEN:.
Four days ago, just after the South Carolina Primary, Gingrich led Romney 41% to 32%. Less than two weeks earlier, coming off Romney’s decisive win in the New Hampshire Primary, it was Romney 41%, Gingrich 19% in Florida. Santorum’s and Paul’s support has remained largely the same throughout. . . .
The new Rasmussen Poll confirms what Insider Advantage also found yesterday, and that is a move up for Romney following his more aggressive debate performance on Monday. American Research Group also put out a poll yesterday showing Romney back to a 7 point lead in Florida.
We now have Romney up to a 3 point lead over Gingrich in Florida in our 3-Day Average of Polls.
Rasmussen Poll Shows Mitt Romney Surging Back to an 8 Point Lead in Florida over Newt Gingrich
Here is video of Newt Gingrich in Florida yesterday where he showed how to deal with a Left-wing heckler. Gingrich told the crowd that Abraham Lincoln had given some instructive advice on how to consider such people:
“Abraham Lincoln once said, ‘If you’re debating somebody who will not agree that 2+2=4, you will never win the debate because facts make no difference. (Point at the heckler) We just met one of Abraham Lincoln’s debating partners for whom facts make no difference. . . . Noise without knowledge is not a free society – it’s anarchy.”Banana Bread Pancakes

While promoting his hit film Safe House recently, Denzel Washington revealed some interesting tidbits about the production and his career at a press conference.
He explains how working with director Daniel Espinosa encouraged him to do the film along with what gave him a better appreciation of acting. Here are a few excepts from DIY: 'hey, "black" country than in a "brown".
The film hits theaters in the UK this Friday (Feb. 24th).Mariah Carey And Nick Cannon Welcome Twins!

At the risk of sharing too many details with my readers, let’s just suffice it to say that when you are eating & traveling in Mexico, it’s worth paying a few extra pesos to get a bathroom that has a vent fan.)

The paper has been cited twice, according to Thomson Scientific’s Web of Knowledge.
But as the expression of concern states:.
So, one of Fernandez’s three institutions, we don’t know which, found cause for concern with his results. Another did not (why only two are referenced here is a mystery). What, we wonder, did Fernandez have to say about all this? If we reach him, or any officials at the various institutions with which he’s affiliated, we’ll update.
Hat tip: Jacek Kominek
On a tangential note: looking at the talk section of the Ariel Fernandez Wikipedia page it has had an investigation all of its own in the past regarding the editing of the page by sockpuppets (hence why the page is now semi protected from edits).
alleged sockpuppets (to clarify)
Will spurious claims of copyright infringement be seen soon? The zeal of certain persons to ensure that their name is not trampled upon is strong.
One of the institutions may be Rice University. Fernandez was professor and Chairman of the Biotechnology Department there for a number of years. The underlying work also seems to be related to dissertations by his advisees:
Rice does not have a “Biotechnology” department, and Ariel Fernandez (who was in bioengineering) was never department chair.
You’re correct. I misread. He was a professor in the department of bioengineering. Sorry.
He also has a retraction for duplicate publication:
There’s also this odd correction for another paper:
How can anyone publish graphs with no error bars?
There is a big errata in PNAS for duplication from the same author. Although duplication occurs significantly in both articles at the level of multiple figures and text, one was retracted while the other escaped somehow with just a correction.
Examination of the data is quite revealing (it is provided in a spreadsheet as an additional file).
Here is a plot of the data for humans, which corresponds to panel A of Figure 1 in the paper. Note that there is no fitted line in my plot. What may at first glance look like a fitted line is actually formed by data points that fall right along a line.
Here is a plot of the data for worm, corresponding to panel C of Figure 1 in the paper. Note that there is no fitted curve in my plot. A large mass of data points fall right along a curve (a parabola, in fact).
This can all be seen by careful inspection of Figure 1 in the paper: in panels A, C, and D, most of the density that looks like a fitted line or curve is actually formed by data points.
This pattern seems anomalous indeed.
An expression of concern has been published for another Fernandez paper:First Edition: November.

In a toast to the literary giants who turned the consumption of alcohol into an art, author Mark Bailey and artist Edward Hemingway have produced one of the most appealing gift books of the season, Hemingway and Bailey's Bartending Guide to Great American Writers. Featuring famous imbibers such as William Faulkner, James Jones, Sinclair Lewis, Dorothy Parker, and, of course, Ernest Hemingway, the guide includes recipes for each author's cocktail of choice, as well as hard-to-top tales of intoxication and classic drinking quotes ( I have a martini, the poet Anne Sexton once said, and I feel, once more, real. ).

"A Mark Twain scholar plans to release a new edition of 'The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn' without the N word."
MPR News features this in Today's Question: Should an editor change a classic novel to keep from offending modern readers?
The comments are a very interesting mix of perspectives: on the status of classic literary works, on the times and tides of culture, on censorship, and on the 'N' word itself.
The replies I read really made me think, and I dug into the MPR News 2004 archives for The 'n-word' feature and the related commentary collection. I found some of the same stuggles - and surprises - with the 'N word' in those pieces.
Is the controversy about the word, or about social structures? Would any other word change spark this much discussion? Share your answer to Today's Question. We're listening.<<

This avoids authors spending time writing articles that are outside areas of interest to the readership of the journal and also avoids duplication and the too frequent review of topics.
All Commentaries undergo timely and transparent peer review and, on occasions where the reviewers take issue with the topic – but neither the quality nor readability – the Commentary is published with an invitation for a “counter- Commentary”. While usually recruited via the invitation of Editorial Board members, unsolicited Commentary topics can be submitted directly to the journal.

Just to clarify:
I actually think Gene Principe is very, very good at his job. It's just that his job is to adore the Oilers regardless of the realities of the situation.
I quite like Principe, I don't like his role.

Shmoop Shout Out 1.0: Linsanity
Jeremy Lin might just be the most successful person on the planet at the moment. However, we dug deep (not that deep) to find a few more reasons to cheer for him:
- It’s not like we can cheer for the clawless Tiger any more. Wait, wrong sport.
- He went to Harvard.
- He’s from our home turf. That’s right: Jeremy Lin played high school ball right down the street from Shmoop HQ. That has to count for something at our next game of S-H-M-O-R-S-E, right?
- He’s just plain awesome.

We believe that every student, regardless of income level, should have access to materials that will help prepare them for college. Learn more by contacting us here.

He has also popped up in both literature (ending to the Scarlet Ibis) and popular culture (“Bohemian Rhapsody“). Definitely one hip guy.

- Dr. Tom Hunter, Director of the Department of Energy's Sandia National Labs
- Dr. George A. Cooper, an expert in materials science and retired professor from UC Berkeley

Department of the Interior Activities in Response to the Deepwater Oil Spill
On Friday, Secretary Salazar dispatched Dr. Marcia McNutt, the director of the U.S. Geological Survey, to the BP Command Center in Houston to help coordinate the joint efforts of federal scientists who are working with BP engineers to address several technological challenges and approaches to securing the damaged well head,. The BOPs contain mechanisms designed to shut off the flow of oil and gas, either on command or automatically, when a wellhead is damaged or experiences a blowout. Federal and company engineers are seeking to determine why the BOP atop the Deepwater Horizon well failed to activate as designed.
In addition, Secretary Salazar has undertaken several initiatives in response to BP's spill, including:
- Announced that no applications for permits to drill will go forward until the Department completes a 30-day review of safety processes that President Obama requested;
- Ordered immediate inspections of all deepwater operations in the Gulf of Mexico. The inspections of deepwater drilling rigs found Incidents of Non-Compliance (INC) on two rigs. Those violations were corrected and no other violations were found. View the inspection report (pdf - 93 kb). Inspections of deepwater production platforms is ongoing.
- Issued a safety notice to all operators, reminding them of their responsibilities to follow MMS regulations and to conduct full and thorough tests of their equipment;
- Established the Outer Continental Shelf Safety Oversight Board (pdf - 866 kb) within the Department of the Interior with top officials to strengthen Outer Continental Shelf safety and improve overall management, regulation, and oversight of OCS operations;
- Launched a joint investigation of the incident with the U.S. Coast Guard to determine what happened.

Questions and answers mahjong mobileGentlemen, (wait for your glow plugs/grid heaters to warm things up and then) start your engines! Ford said today that it will offer a diesel powerplant as an option in its upcoming Transit van.
This engine joins Ford’s twin-turbo EcoBoost V-6 in the Transit‘s known engine portfolio. Ford hasn’t yet given any specifics about the diesel to be used here, and at the present the only diesel Ford offers in the U.S. is a gargantuan 6.7-liter Power Stroke V-8. We think it’s far more likely that the Transit will get a smaller engine. The new Ford Ranger, which isn’t offered in the U.S., is probably a good place to look for clues, and like the U.S.-market Transit, it uses longitudinally mounted engines. The most powerful diesel installed in that truck is a 3.2-liter Duratorq inline-five, which makes 197 hp and 347 lb-ft. It also offers a 148-hp, 277-lb-ft 2.2-liter four.
The Transit is due in to launch in 2013. The van aficionados on our staff—so almost all of us—will be camping outside the Kansas City, Missouri, factory to get the first drive.Forgotten Password?

It is common for people to presume that it often leads to breast cancer. However it is a myth as the reasons forbreast cancerare different. Remember that you don’t have to bother about your health as you will not get affected in any way.
But when I read that Denise Richards regrets getting breast enhancement surgery I had to say something. Chicago classic rock radio station WLUP “The Loop” on Sunday announced the two winners of their “Breast Year Ever” contest a breast augmentation give… There has been a great deal written recently about the now-banned silicone breast implants made by Poly Implant Prothse PIP a French company which has since closed down. It was found that PIP substituted industrial grade silicone for medical grade silicone which led to the closing of PIP’s manufacturing facility in the spring of 2010. You’d think that by the time we hit our 50s we’d have made peace with our breasts. Breast augmentation is on the rise among all age groups and so are its risks.

Blue Ribbon's Bromberg Brothers Talk Restaurants and Trends
I sat down with Eric Bromberg and his younger brother Bruce while they were in town for a demo and book signing, and the duo, who were surprisingly laid-back for New Yorkers, weighed in on their success, the restaurant industry, and the future of Blue Ribbon. Hear what they had to say when you read more.
YumSugar: Why did you write a cookbook?
Eric Bromberg: The same reason why we cook: to share our food with as many people who are willing to try it. We love making people happy with food.
Bruce Bromberg: The idea probably came before the making of our restaurants; growing up, we were obsessed with The New York Times Cookbook and Joy of Cooking. It probably took on a concrete form 10 years ago; not the recipes, but the inspiration and the memories.
YS: Have you been seeing recovery in the restaurant sector? What's the key to your success in such a tough industry?
EB: Yes. More people aren't just going out, but they also seem to be relaxed and having a better time.
BB: We do what we love, and that has resonated. We don't chase fads, or what's hot today. Secondly, I think our rapport, both with clientele and staff, comes through in our food.
YS: OK, so you aren't into fads — but have you noticed any recent restaurant trends?
BB: Specialization in one item; an interest in the craft. [You'll see] butcher shops, or a store that just makes pickles, or only one sandwich. A European market sense has taken root here in the US.
EB: It's not just little spots; retailers have been trying to branch into specialty shops. People want to see someone behind their food.
YS: What's next? Any chance we'll ever see a Blue Ribbon here in San Francisco?
BB: If it was going to be any other city, this is pretty high up on the list. We love San Francisco, and our dad lives in Sea Ranch. We'd have to get used to closing earlier, though.
YS: Are there other restaurateurs that you admire?
EB: There are so many restaurateurs that we admire: Daniel [Boulud], Thomas Keller, Cindy Pawlcyn. But probably the biggest is Rocky Aoki, who started Benihana. When we were kids, we wanted to be Benihana chefs.
YS: Where do you eat outside of Blue Ribbon?
Both: R&G Lounge. We were just there and had duck tongue, jellyfish, and calf's tongue oden. We love ethnic, off-the-beaten-track places, like Jing Fong in New York — it's a banquet palace for dim sum. And Jonathan Waxman's Barbuto; it's casual, and uses fresh ingredients.Tournament tested under extreme match play conditions, this board has proved to be the “Pro’s Cho

Click this link for more informationBears coach Lovie Smith is holding a teleconference at this moment, addressing changes that have been made to his staff in the beginning of the offseason.
We will have a complete breakdown and analysis when it is over. Some key points already:
*** He said a nine-win team is going to the Super Bowl, proof the Bears are not far away after a 9-7 season.
*** Said he is excited about the additions to the staff, and said the offensive coaching staff will remain in tact.
*** Smith said Rod Marinelli will be the assistant head coach and work with the defensive line, as we know.
Bob Babich will continue to be the defensive coordinator, and he will also be the linebackers coach. That means the staff was completed today when Jon Hoke was named secondary coach.
*** Gill Byrd will remain the assistant secondary coach. Eric Washington will remain the assistant defensive line coach.
*** Smith said with Babich working with the linebackers that Smith will help coordinate the defense, and he will be more involved this season.
"I'm excited about taking a more hands-on approach," Smith said.
Check back soon for more details.
Smith said Urlacher was pro bowl and MVP when Babich was his LB coach so he's going back to the position he excels at. Smith also said he will call defensive calls next season during games. Should be interesting, Smith actually calls a good game and has a much better feel for defensive adjustments than Babich ever showed. Now hopefully they stop doing that stupid Mug Up look when the QB is in shotgun.
Just great...now Babich has even more responsibility. Brilliant!
Great job, Lovie!!! I can hardly wait to read what all you negative losers will say now. The "fans" in this town suck!!
what this really means is that Marinelli is most likely the DC now and this is a way for Babich to save face.
I really can't argue with Babich as the linebackers coach. The linebackers played at a very high level between 2004 and 2006. What's becoming apparent though is that he had some incredible talent to work with. What's also becoming apparent is that much like Lovie, Babich seems to be a real "hands-off" guy. That's great when your job is to say "alright guys, just do that thing where you absolutely hammer someone" to Brian Urlacher and Lance Briggs. That's not so great when you're the coordinator of the whole defense. But then again, it seems pretty clear that Lovie installed Babich as the defensive coordinator because he had or was willing to adopt that same attitude in his new role.
The Cover 2 only delivers consistently positive results if the front four is able to create an effective pass rush and disrupt the quarterback by itself. If that threat isn't there, the entire defense gets exposed and falls apart. The other quarterback tends to make less mistakes when he could do his taxes in the time in takes for someone from the defense to get in his face. It doesn't matter if the Bears don't call a Cover 2 on every play because an opposing team doesn't need to score or even gain yardage on every play to win a game. Plus, if you're the Bears, there's the psychological disadvantage of knowing your team isn't equipped to run the plays that are being called.
The Bears haven't had a front four that could consistently apply pressure by itself since December '06, when Tommie Harris got hurt and Tank Johnson was finally let go. Some people say Tommie Harris hasn't returned to the level he was at in the '06 season since, and virtually everyone agrees that Mark Anderson hasn't either. On top of that you've got a declining Ogunleye, a second-round bust in Bazuin, and the obviously injury-prone Dusty Dvoracek. As if that weren't enough...hey, I liked Darwin Walker and I like Anthony Adams too, but shouldn't that playing time being going toward guys like Idonije or Marcus Harrison who have a chance of being on the next Bears Super Bowl team, whenever that happens? I'm all for having depth, but I think we need to figure out who our long-term starters are first. Man I hope Rod Marinelli works out, otherwise we're going to be in 2nd-place-in-the-NFC-North territory for years.
Good move I think. should work out but why does lovie keep goin to bat for babich?
Why beat around the bush? Just make Rod the head coach and Lovie the DC.
No, it sounds to me like Babich has less responsibility. At least on game days, when it counts.
Dennis Gentry,
I love old #29!!
Your comments about the Cover 2 and the impact of the declining DL play is spot on. You hit the nail on the head. Without pressure from the DL, this scheme can be exposed. It was in 2008.
Both in Tampa and here when you have a NT that requires the double team, it forces the opposing OTs to go solo with speed rushers. So you can put pressure on the QB without a blitz.
As was mentioned at the end of the year, the Bears D were among the high percentage of blitzes per play. IOW, we couldn't get pressure on the QB with only the front four. Leaving huge holes in the seam between the safeties and the LBs.
Football still is a game from the line of scrimmage out. DL and OL play is the key determinant.
Again, good post. Thanks.
As long as we play cover-2; i.e. cover-0, prevent, give-up defense, the Bears will NEVER amount to much.
The philosophy of the Bears seems to be like that of our government. Over-spending (by individuals plus the government) got our economy into the mess we are in, so we are going to spend even more money to fix things. For the Bears, playing back, via the cover-0 defense cost us dearly vs. Carolina, Tampa, Atlanta, gb, and Minnesota . . . so now the face of the cover-0 Defense himself will be taking the reins. Does anybody remember what happened in the Super Bowl when we stopped attacking.
Somebody wake me when we decide to play REAL football.
Lovie's plan of calling D plays is a good one. Babich moving back to the linebackers is good. Keeping the Offensive coaches is ok only if they fire them next year if the play calling still remains so predicable.
Can't someone from the Bears offense copy some of the route patterns etc of teams like the Cardinals?
It does seem to me that the Bears are starting to show signs of making progress for next year. What they do in Free Agency and the draft is paramount to taking the next step.
Only one last thing to add and that is the intangible word passion that teams like Baltimore and Pittsburgh seem to always have and what the BEARs used to have...... JA, Lovie and company how can the Bears get the passion back?
By Shemp: "Great job, Lovie!!! I can hardly wait to read what all you negative losers will say now. The "fans" in this town suck!!"
A++++++++++++++!!! Would read again!!!
Holy hell that was the funniest comment I've read on this board in a long, long, long time.
Hey there, Pot? Kettle's on line 1 and he told me to tell you "You're black!" LOL
JPCZ
you are aware that every team plays the cover-2 defense in some form...and that its not our "base" defense...the 4-3 is the base...the bears only are in cover-2 1/3 of the time and this season they blitzed the most out of any other team in the nfl
AND
if the cover-2 is such a bad defense then how has it managed to be around since at least the 60's and they are current teams who "cover-2 teams" who are very successful with it
the scheme isnt the issue...
nor was it an issue in 05 and 06
can we please put this fallacy into the same casket as the bears are cheap. PLEASE
I think this could work. But too much time and money is spent on the defense. More time and focus should be spent on the offense.
That was a test. For some reason, I have trouble posting on this blog.
I agree with the moves that have been made. Lovie is the best defensive play caller on the team. So why not use that resource that we already are paying for. I really don't understand why it wasn't done sooner. Many offensive minded coaches call their offensive plays, so this doesn't hurt the team at all. It's been done before. Rod had success as a D-line coach, so hopefully he helps with the pass rush and penetration at the point of attack. I still believe that a pass rushing DE still needs to brought in. Babich has had success with the LB's, but I believe that is mostly due to the talent we had. Briggs continues to play at a high level. But Urlacher has lost his motivation and Hunter has lost a step. Roach has already replaced Hunter, so that should help us out. Now if Babich can find a way to motivate Big Url, the LB's should be alright. As far as the secondary goes, I'm still an advocate of Peanut at FS. He has the range needed at that position, and has never shown any fear of sticking his helmet in there to make a play. Graham and Vasher (if still here) makes a decent tandem. But we still have Mcbride, who played well in Vasher's absence, and Bowman. Payne and Brown (if around) will continue to man the SS. Payne should be better after having a year under his belt. I do wish that Brown stays with the organization in some capacity. Either as a player or as a Coach. He's a solid guy. These moves should help our defense. We have the talent. We just have to put it all together and find that word "Passion" to throw into the mix. Go Bears!
As I said, hopefully these coaching moves help the team. JUSTINCREDIBLE, great post. You are absolutely correct. I've said the same thing before. But you'll continue to see posters yapping about cover-2, when they have no clue what they are talking about. Most just heard someone else say it and jumped on the bandwagon.
My biggest concern with this team is the offense. So much time and money is spent on the defense, while the offense continues to struggle. For years, this offense is constantly in the bottom half of the league in just about every statistical category. That is a problem to me. In todays league of High Powered Offenses, all defenses get scored on. That's just a reality. So, we need an offense that can score points consistently and with the best of them. We've seen the changes made to the coaching staff on the defensive side. Why non on the offense? We see numerous players go to other teams and shine. But when they were here, they hardly played or were busted. Shouldn't our WR coach be looked at for not developing players here? Shouldn't our O-line coach be looked at when we see former players starting and playing well else where? Shouldn't our play design and playcalling be looked at when everyone calls our offense predictable? We draft many players, but none are developed here. They hang around on the practice squad or are released. Shouldn't our scouting crew be looked at? We have True WR's on the roster (Bennet and Rideau), yet they are not playing. While we have invented WR's (Hester and Davis) on the field constantly. Why do fast, athletic guys play cornerback? Because they can't catch well enough to be a WR. Thus, all the dropped passes. Both Hester and Davis came to us as Cornerbacks. My point is this, we should stop relying on the defense to carry this team. We need an offense that is formidable and can score points consistently. So all areas of that side of the ball should be looked at with just as much diligence as is on the defense. Much money was spent to build the defense. Now put some money into the offense. And don't send me a has-been WR and say that the offense is better. We have talent on the offense. We just have to develope them and play them. There is no reason for Bennett and Rideau to have been on the bench, when our starters are dropping easy passes on a regular. Go Bears!
the offense pre orton injury was actually one of the highest scoring in the nfl
and in 06 they were the highest scoring offense in the nfl(and dont give me crap about special teams and defense scoring other posters...i did the math they avg 24 pts per minus d and special teams...which is still more than enuff to win most games)
and they HAVE spent big money on the offesne...you can question whether it was good money...but benson left out of chicago with a lot of money...so did mushin...JA BOUGHT Himself a good o-line...no one who's played on that line since like 05 was home grown and drafted except beekman and kreutz...
not to mention the money spent on williams to get back surgery
and the fact that the playoff teams left are 1,2,3 and 16th in defense shows you why so much money was and is pumped into it...defense wins championships...
i think the bears could stand to spend money on offense a little more wisely...BUT they have spent a lot of money attempting to fix the offense...bring in free agents...draft offensive 1st round picks (pun intended)they just havent really gotten bang for thier buck...with the exception of thomas jones...
Reggie & JustIncredible,
Nice comments. One idea that seems interesting based on our personnel is a heavy TE set for the O. I think it plays to team's skills. We have a QB who is best at throwing the screens and to big targets across the short and intermediate middle and not so going deep. We have the receivers that are better in the short and intermediate routes. Our two best receiving threats are Forte and Olsen. Clark is equally good. One of their best formations this year was Olsen or Clark replacing the FB and working as a H back. Multiple TEs allows a team to have strong formations to both sides of the ball. If you go to 3 TEs and no FB you'll still have a lone WR. If Kellen Davis develops then we have 3 big pass catching TEs in a formation. Now Davis is best known for his missed block on 4 & 1 in Carolina but he was a monster of a pass catching TE at MSU. So going 3 TEs would force other teams to get out of a nickle package and put 8 or 9 in the box (to prevent the run) because of the multiple TEs. But the speed/size of our TEs means a D that overcommits to the run is vulnerable to mismatches in the D backfield.
The key to this formation is not those already mentioned rather it is having an OL that becomes better at drive blocking -- to force teams to put 8 or 9 in the box. Dan Buenning (sp?) is a drive blocker; Garza not so much. St. Clair is a better drive blocker than he is a pass protector. The OL outperformed expectations last year it was one of the biggest surprises of the year. An upgrade in this unit would have a beneficial impact on the rest of the O.
Still the main point is having a 3 TE set is something plays to our strengths. I would love to see it in action in '09.
Reggie & Just(notvery)Incredible,
I've probably missed less than 5 plays from Bears games in the last 10 years, and have probably missed less than 10 games in the last 30, so I am indeed watching. 'The bears are only in cover-2 about 1/3 of the time' . . . talk about spewing someone else's talking points. YIKES!
What I see the cover-0 as is a defense that bets that the other team can't put together 8-12 play drives and go 80 yards for TDs. It prides itself on not getting beat deep, but rather having receivers catch the ball underneath and having the first defender there making the tackle (something the Bears as a whole are NOT particularly adept at doing). I also see it relying on turnovers and/or penalties to help keep the other team from scoring, but you guys REALLY know your football, so I'm sure I'm not telling you anything you don't already know.
Now, go ask Lovie, and any other proponent of this SISSY defense, and my guess is they will tell you the same as I just did. Then again, I might have just heard someone else say this.
I would prefer a defense that attacks . . . if you don't get there with 5 (which we send on a regular basis . . . where are the sacks?), you bring 6; if not with 6, you bring 7 . . . etc. Buddy Ryan understood this very well, as does his son.
If you look back to the Bears-Colts Super Bowl and what happened after Daniel Manning was burned badly by being out of place (I saw Reggie Wayne in my nightmares for a long time) . . . the defense loosened up; i.e. cover-0, we stopped attacking and had no chance. Do you really think it was Ron Rivera calling the plays from that point forward?
It seems the teams that have beaten us since that game have it figured out: be patient and take the 7 yard quick slant that is available on nearly every snap, and you'll beat the Bears.
Then again, you guys already knew all of this . . . I'm just helping remind you!
JPCZ, how are you my man. I see that you made comments about my post. But I'm not sure why. I talked about people complaining about Cover-2 and how it is not used that often. You replied to that with talk of the Cover-0. That sorta solidifies my point. You also said that they send 5 on a regular (a blitz). Which is true. But, that also solidifes my point once again. If they're running Cover-0 or blitzing, then that cancels out the cover-2. So I truly don't understand the cause of your comments. I too watch all of the games. And I too have been doing so for over thirty years. You are not the only fan on this site. But if we are both fans, then lets focus on the real issues instead of personal attacks on one another. It's senseless. Go Bears!1. Then there was one (barely)
The Falcons are 6-0, which is great but Atlanta is living dangerously. How long will the Falcons fortune remain? Fortunately for Atlanta, who is enjoying its best start in franchise history, Week 7 is a bye week. It may seem odd to say this for an unbeaten team, but the Falcons need some time off to solve some of the problems that have caused Atlanta to trail in their last three games against significantly weaker opposition.Whiteheads are tiny and white raised spots. These are caused by the collection of hardened oil or sebum in the skin pores. These are tiny cysts that are developed because of improper elimination of sebum which is secreted by the sebaceous glands. Whiteheads can appear on any body part, but blackheads and whiteheads usually appear on the face particularly on the forehead, temples, cheeks and around the nose. Below lines give some remedies to get rid of whiteheads naturally.
How to Get Rid of Whiteheads Naturally?
Following are some simple and effective natural cures to get rid of whiteheads:
- Drink lots and lots of water and fresh fruit juices. Consume fresh fruits and vegetables.
- Make a paste with fenugreek leaves and apply this paste over the face every night. Next morning, rinse with warm water to prevent blackheads, whiteheads, pimples, wrinkles and dryness.
- Wash your face thrice a day with a medicated soap, if your skin is oily.
- Unclog the pores of the skin by applying a face mask and steaming. One can also try rubbing the lemon on the skin. This can be repeated twice a week to get immediate effect.
- Whiteheads can be removed effectively by steaming the face for about 1 – 2 minutes. As the whiteheads become soft, use a sterilized needle to prick the apex. Also you can gently press it with your two fingers.
- Jojoba oil is an excellent moisturizer. Use this oil along with green gram flour and rub it on the face. This helps in eliminating blackheads and whiteheads.
- Make a paste with roasted and powdered pomegranate seeds. Add lime juice to it to make a paste and apply it over the whiteheads affected areas. Leave it for about 15 minutes and rinse with warm water. This is an effective way to remove whiteheads naturally.
- Make a paste with sandalwood powder and rose water and apply it on the affected area. Let it stay for 20 – 30 minutes and rinse with lukewarm water.
- Mix a tablespoon of fresh lime juice to a tablespoon of groundnut oil for preventing acne and whiteheads naturally.Center for Free Enterprise
Secret Shopper Hired to Punish Lyft and Uber Actually Prefers Them

Actually, when people adjust regarding inflation, “The Black Knight” grossed just over HALF the money that “A Seem of Music” grossed! Batman does not even come all-around Julie Andrews as far as a bring! Its hard to think this motion picture got while popular the way it did. Being a brand new Batman film helped, as well because the incredible nonsense around it. Again – all of that hype, and that still made Half what “A Sound of Music” would! The various other superhero flick around that period, Iron Guy, blows Dim Knight apart without actually trying. Who could have known of which lowly Iron Man might have had his very own movie one day, and that hed defeat the almighty Batman in to the ground? What any shame, The Darkish Knight staying so popular as it is. If you will discover more Batman videos, lets wish that a few stuff truly happens inside it and its not such a tremendous mess. I have got only study three comedian books having Batman. Every single at least one is genuine genius. When My spouse and i read these comics My partner and i recognized myself at midnight knight. Which is quite good. If most of us compare The actual dark dark night and Batman permanently, I can easily say how the dark dark night wins which battle very easy. I will have only go through three comics but the many comics Weve read do you, like We said, recognize myself at night knight along with Batman Will begin, but definitely not Batman Permanently or Batman & Robin. Maybe it is just a little indicate to examine Nolans a pair of masterpieces to help Schumachers two disgusting and so called Batman movies. With less difficult words, Scumachers batman motion pictures sucked. This will be, my view, the finest comic guide movie ever. I may also say its mostly among the best movies I have ever witnessed! When My partner and i say that it is the greatest comic ebook movie ever, Im saying i always cant imagine that its coming an improved comic guide movie when compared with this, that will be something I do believe is extremely hard. The black knight includes great celebrities like Religious Bale, Heath Ledger who died of overdose, Michael Caine, Gary Oldman whos one among my individual favorites as well as, Morgan Freeman that is a fantastic professional. Its been lots of talk concerning Heath Ledgers wonderful performance because the Joker. The Joker is certainly one of the most popular villains. And heath Journal is stunning, so good, so beneficial. I thought that nobody would beat Marlon Brandos excellent acting inside the godfather nevertheless Heath Ledgers performance is as great as Marlon Brando I believe. I are unable to decide which of those performances is best. Its so hard. But Heath Ledger is great in addition to he makes each and every scenes he has in. Everything he or she does simply just clicks. Some in the people say we who enjoy Heath Ledgers acting at midnight knight merely loving that because he has dead. Which is certainly not genuine. We adore Heath Journal for precisely what he performed, what he be capable of do. We didt start loving Heath Journal until he or she did This joker. Why? Because he or she is so impressive. I never payed as often attention i should include before he did This Joker, I payed care about him while he passed away too. But of which didt created him an improved actor, until he / she did The particular joker. Heath Journal became a great acting the almighty for what he did while using the joker. This Movie provides improvement over Batman will begin. But not by far. Batman begins is a wonderful movie plus it Had somethings which the dark knight didt. I overlooked the Wayne Tower slightly, I missed them that makes Gotham absolutely Gotham. But The actual dark knight is engaging, excellent, magnificent, the Witty book video god. A Godfather two to witty book shows. First of, let me start by declaring that Christopher Nolan is usually a director to watch out for. With each movie he is producing and directing, he is usually proving himself becoming a man connected with great intellect as well as the craftsmanship of an virtuoso. We found him define the most ideal Batman in the movie Batman Begins. And at this point we notice him define the optimal Joker inside movie The actual Dark Dark night. In comparison to all other superheroes, Batman sticks out as unique and unique. So, it isnt easy to deal with the deeper tasks of the Batman.

Hard-line haredi groups believe that no Jewish state should exist before the coming of the Messiah. Some even claim that the Holocaust was made up to provide a pretext for the establishment of the state of Israel.
In 2012 several ultra-Orthodox Jews were arrested for defacing the Yad Vashem Holocaust memorial in Jerusalem with pro-Hitler graffiti.

The Initiative set up a peer and faculty editing review process and held two orientation meetings to teach students how best to submit their work. Within a short time after students began submitting their notes and research papers, four members of the Class of 2011 learned that their work had been accepted for publication in outside legal journals.
As Professor John Leubsdorf, Associate Dean for Faculty and Research, observes: “The students, led by Nicole Barna, conceived and organized this project by themselves – one more indication of our students’ ability and motivation.” Other members of the 2010-2011 SPI executive board integral to its early success are vice president Brian Biglin ’11, treasurer Katharine Fletcher ’12, secretary Daniella Fischetti ’12, and director of events Kathy Oviedo ’12.
Although most students are aware that they can submit their work to an outside scholarly or professional journal, many are intimidated by the process and the associated costs. The Student Publishing Initiative was created to streamline the process, show students how easy it can be to submit their work, and obtain access to ExpressO, the leading journal submission service in the academic legal world. “This is an endeavor that I felt was extremely worthwhile to pursue,” Barna explains. “A publishing credit is a fantastic addition to a resumé. In addition, publication of Rutgers students’ work in outside journals serves to further the reputation of the law school.”
Adds Biglin: “The SPI is a great idea because it enables students to help themselves while enhancing the academic reputation of the law school. SPI, which Nicole brilliantly developed, accomplishes this very purpose. And it is just one more example of how Rutgers students, particularly the Class of 2011, are both innovative and interested in advancing the interests of the school.”
With the support of Professor Leubsdorf and Dean John Farmer, the Initiative obtained a year-long trial subscription to ExpressO that began in February. “This access is invaluable,” Barna explains, “as it allows any Rutgers student to submit their work to hundreds of journals at no cost to the student and in less than 30 minutes.”
In only a little over two months the effort has had impressive success, with students receiving acceptances from international and domestic journals. “I always had great confidence in this idea,” says Barna, “and the ability of Rutgers–Newark law students to be published. However, the caliber of journals that have accepted our students’ papers is what has impressed me the most.” Barna adds that “from the outset, Professor Leubsdorf has been instrumental in getting the faculty on board with this idea.” Many faculty members have offered their time to serve as editors for student papers. “Dean Farmer has also been extremely supportive of the Initiative with his donation to fund our ExpressO access for a year.”
One of the soon-to-be-published authors is Ryan Richman, whose article “Title IX: The Trojan Horse in The Struggle for Female Athletic Coaches to Attain Equal Opportunities in Intercollegiate Sports” has been accepted by the Virginia Sports & Entertainment Law Journal. Richman describes himself as “absolutely thrilled” for the opportunity provided by the Student Publishing Initiative.
Andres Acebo points out that SPI “has given Rutgers Law Students the ability to engage students, practitioners, and legal scholars from all around the country with the means not only to join an ongoing conversation about the great challenges of our time but to shape the discourse itself.” Acebo’s article, “Life, Liberty, and the Pursuit of Whiteness: A Revolution of Identity Politics in America,” is forthcoming in the Columbia Journal of Race and Law. With a note already published by the Rutgers Race and the Law Review, Acebo will graduate with a second article assured publication, an honor that he credits largely to the Student Publishing Initiative under Barna’s direction.
Matthew Pustay, whose paper titled “Logical Inconsistencies in the Law of Euthanasia” will be published by Journal Acta Iuridica Olomucensis (AIO) (Palacký University in Olomouc, Czech Republic), is especially appreciative of the publishing opportunity effort. “This has given students like me, who aren’t on journals or don’t get selected by their journal, a great opportunity to have a ‘publications’ section on our resumés. Many thanks to Nicole Barna, the professors who helped, and the whole Student Publishing Initiative.”
Brian Biglin was successful in having his article on the low-income housing tax credit, analyzing its usage in New Jersey and New York and the fact that it has not been used in an ideal fashion, that is, to create more socioeconomic integration, placed in the Cornell Real Estate Review. Biglin reports that the article, titled “More Affordable Housing, But Where, and for Whom? A New Jersey Study Revealing the Low-Income Housing Tax Credit’s Impact, and the Ongoing Concentration of the Poor,” was “partially inspired by Professor Simmons and what he taught us about the late Professor Payne’s work.” Biglin is now trying to get an article on post-Gallenthin v. Paulsboro redevelopment law published using the ExpressO access provided by SPI.
Barna, who will join the New York law firm of Olshan Grundman Frome Rosenzweig & Wolosky LLP in the fall, has her own publication to look forward to – a note in the Rutgers Race and the Law Review titled “Incarceration or Deportation: Undocumented Criminal Aliens and Policies of Punishment.” In addition to her work on behalf of the SPI, the David S. Solomon Scholar and Rutgers Race and the Law Review editor has been a member of the ABA Labor and Employment Law Trial Advocacy Competition, a Minority Student Program study group facilitator, and most recently a student in the Rutgers Community Law Clinic.
Thanks to the efforts of Barna and the inaugural executive board, the Student Publishing Initiative is now an SBA-recognized student group. Barna is confident that its success will continue under the leadership of the 2011-2012 executive board: president Kathy Oviedo, who is also symposium editor for the Rutgers Race and the Law Review; vice president Andrew Kuntz ’12; treasurer Katharine Fletcher; secretary Daniella Fischetti; journal liaison Tim Oberleiton ’12; and SBA liaison David Acosta ’12.Will tells off Barbara and so does Paul.

So, aside from making your own stuff or reallocating the will, it's not gumballs or superballs, maybe the bling machine is where it's at this year.
Collette: Fuck Christmas. I have medical bills. You can make toys out of Dixie cups and straws. We don't need to go out and buy gifts. We don't have to go to stupid Toys "R" Us. I don't need money to make Christmas and I don't need to see my family at Christmas. They were just here. I got rid of them a day ago. They were here for three days, so that was enough. They don't live here so they can't read this. And we're making toys out of hot dogs, out of Popsicle sticks and toothpicks. It's going to be a banner year.
Jerry: I have a new loved one in my life, so I get to celebrate my holidays this year with a new loved one. I just moved to Atlanta five weeks ago. I'm not too crazy about this traffic, so that's more of an incentive for me to spend my holidays with my new loved one curled up and nestled in front of a fireplace. I'm soaking it in all year. With the economy being the way it is, it actually does bring us closer together because in spending less we actually receive more. We give more of our hearts.Showing page 1 of 13 matching results

Big Brother 6 Nominations Leave Ashlea Evans in Tears
July 07, 2005 09:50 PM by Joe Blackmon
CBS has dubbed Big Brother 6 with the theme of “Summer of Secrets” (even though a more appropriate title would have been “Summer of Models”). The premiere episode gave many hints but provided few answers. The biggest secret that has been revealed is that each houseguest is working with a partner. Conversations between the houseguests seemed to give away two of the partner teams, but most of the partner teams still remain a mystery. Micheal Donnellan and Kaysar Ridha appear to be partners and so do Howie Gordon and Rachel Plencner.
The fourteen houseguests initially enter the house in groups of four or five. The first groups in get all the beds and three of the last group wind up in sleeping bags. The fourteen houseguests are then asked to divide into two teams of seven, change into swimsuits, and head out to the backyard. The orange team consists of April Lewis, Maggie Ausburn, Howie Gordon, James Rhine, Janelle Pierzina, Sarah Hrejsa, and Rachel Plencner, while the blue team consists of Ivette Corredero, Kaysar Ridha, Micheal Donnellan, Beau Beasley, Jennifer Vasquez, Ashlea Evans, and Eric Littmann.
The first challenge involves balancing on a surfboard and throwing coconuts into the mouth of a Big Kahuna. Howie Gordon proves to be quite adept with a coconut and leads the orange team to a dominating victory over the blue team. Howie sinks all 23 of his team’s baskets, while the blue team attempts to alternate shooting and sinks only 7 baskets. The losing blue team will be forced to endure a diet of only peanut butter and jelly for the next seven days, while the orange team will not only get to eat regular food but also wins the right to compete among themselves for head of household.
The head of household challenge involves seeing who can stand on a surfboard in the pool the longest. The orange team quickly forms an alliance and agrees that no one on the team will be put up for nomination regardless of who takes head of household. Orange team members step down one-by-one until just Howie Gordon and Rachel Plencner are left. After a brief but revealing conversation, Howie jumps off saying he has to take a leak, and Rachel takes the first head of household competition.
The head of household room turns out to have its own bathroom and shower. Rachel seeks the advice of her other houseguests on who to nominate. James Rhine tries to convince Rachel that Jennifer Vasquez needs to go, but Rachel actually winds up nominating Ashlea Evans and Kaysar Ridha. Ashlea breaks down into tears after her nomination. Previews of upcoming episodes show that Rachel will discover another secret of Big Brother 6, which is a hidden room.

ReviewsAmerica’s Prisons: Is There Hope?
Dreams from the Monster Factory: A Tale of Prison, Redemption and One Woman’s Fight to Restore Justice to All
America’s prison system is in a dire state. Some 2.3 million people in this country are now behind bars, five times more than in 1978. Our incarceration rate is now higher than that of any other country in the world. Many, if not most, inmates probably should not be there. Sixteen percent of the adult prison population suffers from mental illness and should be in treatment; a similar fraction is made up of children under eighteen. Although there is little evidence that blacks are more likely to use drugs than whites, they are six times more likely to be imprisoned on drug-related charges.1 Of those, most have no history of violence or drug dealing, and were arrested mainly for possession of drugs.2
Sexual and other forms of abuse in prison are common, reported by some 20 percent of inmates. These “monster factories,” as the lawyer and author Sunny Schwartz calls them, do little to break the cycle of violence in society and may even accelerate it. Roughly two thirds of those released from US jails and prisons end up back inside within three years. Some studies suggest that the experience of imprisonment can be so brutal and humiliating that it actually makes men, in particular, harder and meaner, so that the crimes they commit the next time around are even worse than what got them incarcerated in the first place.3.
Schwartz, now in her fifties, began working in the San Francisco county jails in 1980 as a student intern. She volunteered to spend two days a week writing reports on prisoners’ complaints about sentencing or jail conditions and forwarding them through the seemingly impenetrable bureaucracy of the California state justice system. After graduating from law school, Schwartz worked briefly for an AIDS service organization and then, in 1990, at the request of her old boss Sheriff Michael Hennessey, she returned to County Jail 7 in San Bruno to launch a new set of programs designed to help inmates make the transition back into society after their release.
The inmates at San Bruno were typical of prison and jail populations across America. Over half were black, although blacks make up only 6 percent of San Francisco’s population. Approximately 75 percent were high school dropouts, and most had reading skills below the seventh-grade level; 65 percent had been relegated to special education programs before dropping out of school, and 90 percent had never held a legal job. Eighty percent reported that they had been physically or sexually abused as children, and 80 percent had committed at least one act of violence. In jail, these inmates spent their days watching television (Jerry Springer, slasher movies, cartoons), working out, getting into fights with one another, being strip-searched by the deputy sheriffs, and composing elaborate complaints to the authorities.
Some 70 percent of inmates released from San Bruno ended up back in jail within three years, a slightly higher failure rate than the national average. Schwartz’s job was to develop programs to change this. Her first move was to open a jail-based high school with classes in reading, writing, math, and other subjects, as well as “life skills”—meaning how to get and hold on to a job. In many respects the school she set up was a success. Inmates appreciated having something to do during the day, and many earned degrees that would greatly increase their prospects for employment upon release. But this had only a modest effect on their violent tendencies. During off-hours, they continued to pick fights with one another. Overhearing inmates yelling into the phones, the guards assumed that this aggressive behavior would continue after they were released. “We taught him to read,” one of them joked. “Let’s put up a sign telling him to stop beating his wife.”
Schwartz began to wonder whether classroom instruction alone would convey the skills the inmates needed to remain in society once they got there. Although the jail contained both men and women, the men worried her far more. Some were so aggressive and violent that they frightened even a seasoned criminal lawyer like her. Some men even frightened themselves. One who was about to be released begged Schwartz to keep him inside because he feared that he would be unable to restrain himself from assaulting a neighbor’s five-year-old daughter. She knew that some men, perhaps including this one, were beyond rehabilitation, but she also knew instinctively—and correctly, it turned out—that most could change if they were given the chance, but they would need powerful emotional assistance to do it. What this assistance would consist of was not obvious at first.
Shortly after she began work at San Bruno, Schwartz attended a conference in Minnesota where she heard for the first time about “restorative justice.” Contemporary justice in the United States is largely based on the idea of retribution, and relies primarily on punishment. Restorative justice, as Schwartz explains it, is based on the concept prevalent in more traditional societies that offenders must also try to repair, as far as possible, the harm they have caused others. In order to do this, offenders must first confront what they have done, and then make amends to their families, their communities, and, if possible, their victims as well. Schwartz writes that she very soon came to believe that restorative justice could be a means of transforming these men from chronic offenders into productive members of their communities.
The first step, persuading the San Bruno inmates to face up to their own violent behavior, would be the most difficult. What is particularly striking about violent men is how remorseless they often seem, as if they were devoid of feeling. Schwartz shows how their experience under the justice system only reinforces this sense of detachment. During their trials, defense lawyers coached them to deny or minimize their crimes. In jail, they spent their days complaining about the conditions, their sentences, the behavior of the deputies and other inmates, and society at large. At no time were the men ever required to assess their own behavior or acknowledge the pain they had caused.
Schwartz was familiar with various kinds of “anger management” classes, most of which simply taught violent men to suppress their rage or walk away from situations that might provoke it. She wanted something different, a program that would help the men examine and ultimately “rewire” their own emotions. She decided to experiment with Manalive, a community-based program for men who had committed domestic violence that had been created years earlier by Hamish Sinclair, a San Francisco–based educator and community organizer. Manalive soon became the foundation for all of Schwartz’s other programs, which collectively came to be called the Resolve to Stop the Violence Project, or RSVP..
While RSVP does not involve direct restitution to victims, it reinforces prisoners’ sense of responsibility by inviting speakers who have been victims of unrelated violence to address the inmates. RSVP also encourages restitution to society at large by linking up post-release RSVP “graduates” with youth violence prevention groups and campaigns such as the San Francisco Giants’ “strike out violence day.”
In 2004, the psychiatrists James Gilligan and Bandy Lee of New York University and Yale, respectively, evaluated RSVP and found that it sharply reduced recidivism rates. The longer the men stayed in the program, the better it seemed to work. Among those who took the full sixteen-week course, 82 percent fewer ended up back in jail a year later, compared to a control group of men who had not been through the program.4
Schwartz deals only in passing with the factors that led to America’s staggering incarceration rate in the first place. When I first arrived at the San Bruno jail, I was taken to a surveillance booth with glass panels on the floor from which it was possible to see an entire open-plan block, or dorm, at once. It was midday, and men in orange sweatsuits were standing around in groups. Some were eating lunch, others were playing ping-pong or watching TV. It was no surprise that most of the men were black. Nationally, one black man in nine between the ages of twenty and thirty-four is incarcerated, a rate six times higher than for whites in the same age group. Some 65 percent of black high school dropouts spend part of their lives behind bars.5 The growth in America’s incarceration rate, in other words, is owing largely to the soaring incarceration of black men. This deeply troubling trend is powerful testimony, if we needed any, to the depth of America’s racial problems.
What
This makes the growing activity of drug cartels from Mexico and other countries particularly threatening.17 But as the Obama administration acknowledges, it does not help simply to blame the foreign drug traffickers alone. What can American policymakers do to get the drug trade out of black neighborhoods? Policing is important, but severe crackdowns could, like Prohibition, make matters worse.
Policymakers could start by improving schools in black neighborhoods, which suffer severely from underinvestment, overcrowding, class disruption, and high dropout rates. This endangers us all, and should be addressed, because the likelihood of incarceration falls with increasing education, especially for black men. According to one estimate, 23 percent of the discrepancy in black/white incarceration rates could be eliminated if blacks stayed in school as long as whites, and that was in 1980, before the thirty-year surge in black incarceration got underway. An even greater effect was seen with violent crime, such as murder and assault. According to the authors of this study, a one percent increase in the graduation rate could save $1.4 billion that would otherwise be spent keeping these men behind bars.18
A high school diploma itself seems to help keep black men out of trouble. The likelihood of incarceration drops fourfold among black high school graduates compared to those who make it only to tenth or eleventh grade.19 It is unlikely that there is anything special about the twelfth-grade curriculum that would explain this. However, graduation may indicate a relatively positive attitude toward society and toward oneself that is more important for keeping black youths out of trouble than any skill or knowledge acquired in school. Some studies suggest, remarkably, that a diploma may matter more than one’s income, or even whether one has a job at all.20 Prison education programs that allow inmates to earn college degrees have also been associated with a drop in recidivism.21 Thus the decision of former New York governor George Pataki to end these programs in the mid-1990s may well have had consequences for public safety.

I vote for Hassenpfeffer!
I've always wondered what Hassenpfeffer was, ever since the Bugs Bunny cartoon where Yosemite Sam is the king and he threatens to make Bugs Bunny into Hassenpfeffer if he doesn't kill the dragon. Remember the ending? Bugs is disguised as the cook and Sam is screaming, "Cook! Cook! Where's my lunch? Where's my dinner? WHERE'S MY HASSENPFEFFER?"
Now I know!

!WARNING!: Save Bernd has viruses on the site!
Bunny lovers everywhere can once again breathe easily: savetoby.com is a hoax. Although the site now lacks a disclaimer, a visitor to it on 9 February 2005 spotted one that said: "Note: this is a joke: please only donate to buy gear or help support savetoby.com." Even without such explicit clarification, certain things about the site should make the buffoonery clear:. a world where rabbits are regarded as worthless and animal shelters can't find donors to support their work.
The 'Balance:' figure which purports to showcase the amount already extorted (located near the bottom of the site's main page in a section labeled 'Premium Account Overview') is a fixed graphic, not a counter. It is periodically edited to increase the number displayed so as to maintain the appearance that folks actually are chipping in to preserve Toby's life. As of 1 March 2005, the amount shown was $16,380.18.
Similar to savetoby.com is Save Bernd! (
), another "pay or the rabbit gets it" site run by an operator who threatens to turn Bernd, a pet bunny he found outdoors on a rainy night, into "Rabbit with Chanterelle" for his Easter dinner if visitors don't donate 1,000,000 Euros by 27 March 2005. (Warning: The "Save Bernd!" site is pop-up hell. If you go to that site, don't expect to easily back out of the many new browser windows its advertising programs will open. We do not offer an clickable link to it because some of our readers have reported strange behaviors on the part of their computers after visiting the "Save Bernd!" site.)
Bernd was previously scheduled to become someone's New Year's dinner; earlier versions of the site announced "I swear by God, I will have this lovely rabbit for New Year's Eve Dinner if my account doesn't show a balance of at least 1,000000

Rabbit is "ok", not my favorite, but it could be just horror at the idea that they killed Thumper.
I'm also not keen on bear meat. When I was a kid my Dad killed one and had it ageing in his shop without letting us kids know till after we found it. Bears look -really- creepily human when they are skinned and hung.

Yeah, there was a case in Alberta when I lived there. Someone dug up a bunch of hands in their field one day. Turned out that they were skinned bear paws. Someone got in trouble for poaching bears, eventually.
Rabbit's yummy. My mom would never eat it because she said the skinned rabbit looked too much like a dead baby.
Bear's good, too, esp. in sausages.
Mmm, damn you guys got me thinking I need to order some 'different' meat. There was an ad in the local paper the other day for elk meat. Maybe I should get some...
As for the topic, I think that anyone would be nuts to give this freak cash either way (whether he kills it or not). They're just feeding this guy free cash (that is, if he's ever actually accepted money for this...). And even if 'they' succeed in saving the rabbit, the result is the same. What did they gain?
So, if I send him money and he doesn't reach his monetary goal and kills the rabbit anyway, do ya think he'd send me some stew?

About the cloned cats mentioned by James. I saw a program on Dicovery channel cloning cats not too long ago. Interestingly, the cloned cats they were doing came out with different coloured/textured fur. *If I recall correcly*, they cloned a calico and the clone was tabby coloured. So, if it won't have the personality of your animal, nor would it look like your animal, why bother.

Posted: Fri May 20, 2005 | 11:53 PM
Yes...I read all about cloning cats on clonekatie.com
She knows that the cat may not look the same as the genetic doner. Read her website! Wait, her site is not up at the moment. I emailed her, she said it would be up again in a couple of days.

Cruel Summer is looking more like just another summer gone by.
Review Score: 3.8
It’s been a long and grueling summer for music. Expectations were high and artist had to live up to them. The “cliques” were running rampant across the radio waves and one in particular had an edge (not YMCMB). The Kanye West-led G.O.O.D Music was in every headphone, car radio and boom box. With the release of “Way Too Cold” by Kanye West with a DJ Khaled-assisted beat, fans of hip hop was gearing up for the biggest clique release of the summer.
Cruel Summer was the title of the most anticipated clique album since the BET Hip Hop Awards cypher. The introduction track features the R&B legend R. Kelly and Kanye West entitled, “To The World”, my first thoughts were, how did Jay-Z feel when that happened? The titillating synth gets you and the snares with the grace of R. Kelly’s voice. “Clique” with Big Sean, Kanye and Jay-Z bring in the grit and wit of the high standard of lyrics that G.O.O.D music is known for. A song that stood out to me was “The Morning” with a hip hop/reggae infused beat and lyrics from Raekwon, Common, Cyhi the Prynce, 2 Chainz, Kid Cudi, Dbanj, Pusha T and Kanye. This compilation embodies the recipe for a successful group album. The album even has a guest appearance from rapper-turned-pastor-turned-rapper Ma$e.
Overall, this was a great effort from G.O.O.D Music to show what their clique has to offer. The songs that stuck out to me were more alternative than hip hop, “Creepers” by Kid Cudi and “Bliss” by John Legend and Teyana Taylor. I went in with high expectations, wanting that thing that sets G.O.O.D Music apart from the others and it didn’t live up to it but it came close. Maybe I expected more than I should have. It was indeed a Cruel Summer, I hope the fall has some bigger surprises in store.

Documenting Grandmas’ prescriptions for skin ailments in Valsad district, GujarSabers over Syria
For months, President Barack Obama has batted away questions about possible U.S. military intervention in Syria, where government forces have slaughtered citizens by the thousands. Obama’s tone intensified Monday when the president threatened direct military action if Damascus attempts to use chemical or biological weapons — or slips them to allied militant groups such as al-Qaida:
“We cannot have a situation in which chemical or biological weapons are falling into the hands of the wrong people,” Obama said during a news conference at the White House. “We have been very clear to the Assad regime but also to other players on the ground that a red line for us is, we start seeing a whole bunch of weapons moving around or being utilized. ... That would change my equation.”
But the threat of action also poses political risk for Obama: The last time an American president threatened military action over WMD in the Middle East, he ignited a firestorm of domestic debate — most of it pegged to the question: What American national security interests are at stake in this fight?
— Chicago TribuneH is for Hob Nob Drive In, Sarasota, Florida
I have a weakness for thick-sliced, golden, crisp onion rings and recently discovered simply divine rings at Sarasota, Florida’s Hob Nob Drive In. The exterior melted in my mouth while the onion slice was tender and juicy. Perfection!
Of course, the cheeseburger isn’t too bad either. Established in 1957, the Hob Nob Drive In is a Sarasota institution with its open-air seating, black and white checkered-tile and diverse clientele.
Hob Nob Drive In, A Sarasota Institution
Located on the corner of U.S. 301 and 17th Street, the city’s oldest drive-in serves up hand-made milkshakes, juicy hamburgers, and 1950s nostalgia with black and white stripes outside, black and white tiles around the main seating area and pop of fire engine red on the restaurant’s exterior.
The Hob Nob appeals to a variety of diners. Pony up to the bar and find yourself sitting next to a businessman in a suit on one side and a biker with a leather jacket on the other.
In addition to hamburgers, cheeseburgers, fries and rings, the eatery serves up breakfast beginning at 6 a.m. Adult beverages of beer and wine are available but bring out the kid in you with a thick milkshake.
My cheeseburger basket with onion rings with slaw along with a soda came to less than $10 with tax.
Should you find yourself in Southwest Florida, roll on over to the Hob Nob for a slice of Sarasota life.
Hob Nob Drive In
1701 N. Washington Blvd.
Sarasota, Fla. 34234
Tel: (941) 955-5001
The restaurant is open Sunday through Thursday, 6 a.m. to 8:30 p.m. and Saturday and Sunday 6 a.m. to 9 p.m. for both dining in and taking out. But dining in is way more fun!

;)
... and I've got to stop falling asleep mid-stream-of-consciousness/brain-dump (not 'bran'-dump! as that's something else entirely: 'brain'-dump!)
I'm going to entitle this article JILL after a lovely lady I knew, Ernimagilda Mucciaroni. 'Ernimagilda,' it turns out, is a nickname for Maria Theresa.
Santa Theresa, pray for us.
So, all combinators, and, by extension, a set of functional logics can be expressed by two combinators, the S:
S = \ x y z -> xz(yz)
and the K
K = \ x y -> x
combinators. Given those two combinators, and only those two combinators, you can rewrite any of the other combinators, like, for example, the I combinator:
I = \ x -> x
is SKK
Or the B combinator:
B = \ x y z -> x(yz)
is simply SI, which I being defined above is S(SKK), or SII, I'll look that up. xxx
Great, we've got it all.
Problem. The K combinator, the constifier, drops a combinator from the discussion. So, if we're proving something, and we come across an inconvenient true, we simply apply the K combinator, and just drop it.
What if that instance of truth, that we just dropped, was the only instance in out universe of discourse?
Well, you could apply the continuation function and, going back in time, get it back. Or, without the continuation function, you could simply invent another universe, or reconstruct the one you were working with that truth back in there, and you're good to go, you can carry on from there.
Some philosophers have a problem with this, understandably, the 'oh, you can just go back and redo if you get it wrong the first time or if you find you needed it later'-excuse smacks of sloppiness, and in mathematics you have to be rigorous; you can't be sloppy. Imagine, for example, if they were blasé in constructing the Hilbert spaces? How much buy-in would there be if the disclaimer were added: "Oh, if something goes awry, just start over from the beginning and hope for the best. That should work"?
Yeah. No.
So, some site the dropping operator as the foundational problem, if there exists a truth in your space, why would you want to drop it? You'll only have to reconstruct it later on, anyway.
So, from that concern there arose the discussion around the 'noble' basis, or, how can we do what we need to do without discarding things that appear inconvenient or seem expedient to do so. After all, the Hilbert space is ... pretty big. There is room in this mathematics to carry around truths, regardless of their current utility. So, what combinators are necessary but also not destructive? Can this even be done.
It could. Four combinators showed to be of high utility in that they could construct the other combinators, except K, and they were S, M, B, and I or S, M, C, and I, depending on the preference of the proponent. Either set worked tolerably well.
But four combinators? Couldn't there be a reduced set that allowed one to use the noble set? After all, the SK-basis was originally the SKI-basis until someone brilliant realized that simply using S's and K's the I could be independently reproduced and therefore was unnecessary to form that basis.
It turns out in the noble SCMI-basis (or also in the SBMI-basis), there was. The J. The J combinator is defined as follows:
J = \ x y z w -> xy(xwz) xxx
The J in combination with another combinator would be able to reproduce the S (obviously), the C or the B (both, actually) and the M. Do you see which combinator?
Well, the T combinator:
T = \ x y -> yx
is JII:
JII = \ I I z w -> II(Iwz) -I-> wx = T -- simplest realization
The R combinator:
R = \ x y z -> yzx
is JT or J(JII):
JT = \ T y z w -subst-> Ty(Twz) -T-> (Twz)y -T-> (zw)y = R
So, C from J, T, and R:
C = \ x y z -> xzy
(J(JII)(J(JII))(J(JII)))
or
RRR ... HA!
because RRRabc = RaRbc = Rbac = acb !
I = I -- simplest, simplest realization
M = \ x -> xx
But to get M, B would really help, so B is:
B = \ x y z -> x(yz)
B = C(JIC)(JI)xyz = (JIC)x(JI)yz = JICx(JI)yz = IC(I(JI)x)yz = C((JI)x)yz = JIxzy = Ix(Iyz) = B
So, M from J, I, B, C, R, T:
J(Ra)III = (Ra)I((Ra)II) = I((Ra)IIa = IIaa = aa = M, which, in combinators is:
RI(RI(RI(BJR))) ... RI moves the desired system down the chain ... for the 'J' anyway.
which is RI(RI(BJR))aI = RI(BJR)aII = BJRaIII = J(Ra)III
So, now S:
S = \ x y z = xy(xz)

The Sonic has aggressive exterior and interior styling. Engine choices are the same ones you'll find in the larger Chevrolet Cruze, including a turbocharged offering. A sporty RS hatchback model of the Sonic is also available.
An all-new RS trim model joins the Sonic family for 2013. Available only as a hatchback, the Sonic RS features exterior enhancements like a ground effects kit for both bumpers and side skirts, 17-inch wheels, a rear spoiler and darker mirrors. Inside, the Sonic gets premium quality leather and large side bolsters for the seats.
Other changes for 2013 include a Connectivity & Cruise Package for the Sonic LT that includes cruise control, steering-wheel audio controls, Bluetooth connectivity and a USB port/secondary auxiliary jack. Remote start is also now standard on LT models equipped with the automatic transmission.
Exterior
Chevrolet says it took design inspiration for the headlights from the motorcycle world. The Sonic's hunkered-down, raked stance adds to its aggressive looks. Exterior features include:
- Five-door hatchback or four-door sedan
- Standard 15-inch steel wheels with covers, optional 15-, 16- and 17-inch alloy wheels
- Available rear spoiler and fog lamps
- Available power side mirrors
- Available power moonroof
Interior
Like the outside, the inside takes inspiration from motorcycles, Chevrolet says. The instrument cluster is one of the more identifiable products of that approach, attaching a digital LCD readout to an analog speedometer.
Trunk space for the sedan is 14 cubic feet. The hatchback sees added cargo room behind the rear seats. Interior features include:
- Available power windows
- Standard power locks and air conditioning
- Standard steering-wheel-mounted audio controls
- Cloth seats standard; leatherette or imitation leather available with optional front-seat heating
- Optional six-speaker premium audio system with available MyLink entertainment and information system
- Available remote start
Under the Hood
Mechanical features include:
- 1.8-liter four-cylinder engine makes 138 horsepower and 125 pounds-feet of torque
- Optional turbocharged 1.4-liter four-cylinder makes 138 hp and 148 pounds-feet of torque
- Five-speed manual or six-speed automatic transmission (1.8-liter four-cylinder)
- Six-speed manual or six-speed automatic transmission (turbocharged 1.4-liter four-cylinder)
Safety
Safety features include:
- Front disc/rear drum antilock brakes (all disc on RS model)
- 10 standard airbags
- Hill start assist
- Electronic stability control
Sonic RS
Chevrolet is introducing a Sonic RS for 2013, bringing show plus a little more go to its subcompact. As we've come to expect from Chevrolet's RS badge, the car gets cosmetic updates and handling improvements. It should be a little quicker than the regular Sonic, which has the same engine, thanks to shorter gearing for its six-speed manual. seats..
Chevrolet's turbo 1.4-liter four-cylinder makes 138 hp and 148 pounds-feet of torque. Four-wheel-disc brakes should improve braking performance versus the Sonic's disc/drum setup. A stiffened suspension rides less than a half inch lower, but the RS offers neither a limited-slip differential nor a fully independent rear suspension. Back to top

Deviled Eggs
(makes 20-24 deviled egg halves)
10-12 hard boiled eggs
1/3 cup mayonnaise
2 tbspn yellow mustard
1 scallion, finely chopped
1/8 tspn salt
Dash black pepper
Once hard boiled eggs have cooled, carefully remove the shells. Slice each egg lengthwise with a shark knife, making clean halves. This can also be achieved with a thread of dental floss. Drop yolks into a bowl and set the whites hole side-up. Mix mayo, mustard, salt, pepper, and scallion with the yolks until blended well. Fill holes with yolk mixture. For a fancier presentation, pipe egg stuffing through a sheet of waxed paper twirled into a cone, with the end snipped off with scissors–makes a quick, disposable pastry tool, too.
Cost Calculator
1 dozen eggs: $1.29
1 scallion (in bunch of 6 for $0.99): $0.22
1/3 cup mayonnaise: ≈ $0.10
2 tbspn mustard: ≈ $0.10
Total: ≈ $1.71
Health Factor
Three brownie points – you’ll gain some protein from this appetizer, for the cost of minimal fats and some cholesterol.

The European Space Agency’s Rosetta spacecraft has lately been going through a series of thruster burns to bring it to a final rendezvous with the comet on August 6th. At 1.9 by 3.1 miles in size, 67P is a relatively tiny chunk of dust and ice — making Rosetta’s coming meet-up after a journey of a decade and many millions of miles quite an amazing feat!
To see exactly how Rosetta has gotten there, check out the model above. You can also visit Solar System Scope (link above) and run the model there.
Here’s an animation of some of the latest images of the comet, acquired by Rosetta on July 14:
Comet 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko was imaged on July 14, 2014 by OSIRIS, Rosetta’s scientific imaging system, from a distance of about 12,000 km (7,456 miles). This animation uses 36 images each acquired 20 minutes apart, providing a 360° preview of the complex shape of the comet. (Source: ESA/Rosetta/MPS for OSIRIS Team MPS/UPD/LAM/IAA/SSO/INTA/UPM/DASP/IDA)
The plan is for Rosetta to orbit for two months — which would be a first — all the while examining the comet’s surface. And in early November it will release a lander named Philae, which is supposed to touch down on the comet’s surface to carry out detailed scientific analyses. That would be another first.
The goal is to better understand the origin and evolution of the solar system. As ESA describes it:.
And here is how Philae will carry out its measurements:chemical.
I’m really looking forward to Rosetta’s final rendezvous on Aug. 6th, and I’m planning to post updates and images in the run-up. So check back.

By Bob Berwyn
SUMMIT COUNTY —While Frisco is just starting a public process to get feedback on the possibility of developing a new grocery store on the town-owned interstate parcel, Whole Foods Market announced Wednesday that it has signed a lease for a new store, subject to review and approval by local authorities.
“It’s official. We’re definitely taking a look at it,” said spokesman Ben Friedland (formerly with Copper Mountain). More info on the town’s process is online at the Frisco Government website.
You can also get updates on a Whole Foods Market Twitter Feed, or check out a Facebook Whole Foods booster page.
The lease is with Boulder-based Brynn Grey Partners LTD, an entity controlled by local developer David O’Neil. The deal has been in the works for a year and was announced as part of a Whole Foods Market quarterly earnings statement. Seven other new stores, averaging about 30,000 square-feet each, are also in the works. All are in urban or suburban locations.
The lease with Brynn Grey locks in the Frisco location, at least for now, which some local boosters see as a business coup during a time when commercial development is still dampened as a result of the overall real estate slowdown.
Whole Foods would be an anchor tenant on the parcel, located near the Frisco Transfer Station on Lusher Court. So far there’s been little discussion of what other tenants might be housed in the new retail area.
Once the town gets informal feedback from residents, a formal planning review could begin. If the store is approved, the parcel could either be sold or leased to O’Neil’s company, which would then rent it to Whole Foods Market.
Whole Foods is in an expansion mode, opening 18 new stores in 2011, averaging about 39,000 square feet each. The company’s earnings report shows an average development cost of $9.8 million per store.
Right now, Whole Foods operates about 300 stores across the country. In an earnings call last May, company executives said their long-term target is 1,000 stores. Overall, the trend is toward smaller stores, especially in urban settings, where large commercial real estate spaces are hard to find.
Other than existing stores on the Front Range, Whole Foods is also preparing to open a mid-sized store in Basalt. That project has also been in the works for several years and was halted for several months when the developer building the store failed. A new developer stepped in, and the store is scheduled to open this summer.
Some of the Pitkin County news coverage of the Basalt store suggests the store could generate more than 100 new jobs, but Friedland said it’s too early to talk about specifics for Frisco. The number of store associates would depend on the exact size and configuration, he said.
While the new store has been touted as having the potential to create jobs and generate sales tax revenue, it’s far from clear what the net impact would be.
A voice of caution came from Mark Belkin, organizing director of the United Food & Commercial Workers Union Local 7 representing local Safeway workers, along with about 25,000 other union members in Colorado and Wyoming.
Belkin said any new jobs have to weighed against potential losses of existing jobs at the Frisco Safeway. Belkin emphasized that the Safeway employees enjoy good health benefits and that their jobs are legally protected under the company’s contract with the union.
“Those types of jobs are quickly disappearing,” Belkin said
Similarly, estimates of sales tax revenues have to be calculated by including possible losses in revenues at other food retailers, including Safeway and Wal-Mart, although Belkin said that Whole Foods and Safeway are not necessarily direct competitors, since Whole Foods is a generally seen as a high-end grocer.
“Safeway is a competitive organization, been in the food business for decades,” Belkin said.
Those calculations will be part of the process the town will go through before approving the development, deciding if that’s the best and highest use for a valuable parcel owned by the citizens of Frisco

It will be interesting to see whether the residents of the area are willing to pay the higher prices.
I have enjoyed shopping at WF… and I still have mixed feelings about their presence in Frisco. My concerns are related to the existing businesses, the local “community” feel that Frisco has been pushing for… and just generally the impact of another company plopping down along I-70.
Then I read this: .”
SEE THE WHOLE ARTICLE HERE:
So, while I like the idea of an influx of cash to the county, and potentially new jobs (even if they are the typically lower wages)… but does Frisco really want to look like a Denver suburb? or do we need this for the County to survive these down cycles in the economy.
I just don’t know…..
I think second home owners probably will, since many of them might shop at Whole Foods at home, and tourists will, since many folks on vacation will splurge somewhat on food. I’m a full-time resident of Summit County and I’ll shop there for specialty items, just like I used to do when I lived in Boulder.
It might be worth noting that David O’Neil is not a local developer. Brynn Grey is out of Boulder. As is David. He has a house here and certainly is in Breckenridge and Frisco quite a bit but his main residence and offices is Boulder.

Easy creamy coleslaw
From: Chef Katie Brown
INGREDIENTS
• 4 cups preshredded cabbage for coleslaw
• 3 carrots, peeled and shredded
• 2 bunches radishes, thinly sliced in rounds
• 1 1/2 cups mayonnaise
• 1 tablespoon mustard
• 1/4 cup apple cider vinegar
• 1/3 cup sugar
• 1/2 teaspoon Tabasco sauce
• 1/2 teaspoon cayenne pepper
• Salt and pepper to taste
DIRECTIONS
Mix together coleslaw mix, carrots, and radishes. Set aside.
Mix all other ingredients except the salt and pepper together in a large bowl with a whisk until smooth. Add the dressing to the slaw and toss. Salt and pepper to taste.
Refrigerate for at least 1 hour before serving.
Crispy no-fry fried chicken
From: Chef Katie Brown
INGREDIENTS
• 8 cups garlic and Parmesan croutons (2 packages)
• 4 tablespoons dried thyme
• 6 tablespoons fresh parsley, roughly chopped
• 10 eggs, lightly beaten
• 5 tablespoons spicy brown mustard
• 3 tablespoons olive oil
• 4 cups flour
• 4 chickens, quartered
• Salt and pepper to taste
DIRECTIONS
Preheat oven to 425 F.
Prepare the "assembly line" of ingredients that you will use to coat the chicken. First, place croutons and dried thyme in a food processor and pulse until chopped roughed. Transfer the crouton-thyme mixture to a large plate and mix with parsley. Set aside.
Make the "glue" that will hold crumbs on to the chicken parts. In a bowl, whisk together eggs, mustard, and oil. To finish the setup, place the flour on a plate and set the three elements of the recipe (flour, egg mixture, and crouton mixture) in a line.
Rinse the chicken parts under cool water and pat dry with paper towels. Generously season chicken skin and meat with salt and pepper.
Dredge a piece of chicken on both sides in the flour and shake to remove the excess. Dip the flour-coated chicken in the egg mixture. Dredge chicken on both sides in the bread crumb mixture, patting on more by hand if needed.
Place coated chicken, skin side up, on baking sheet. Bake for 40 minutes or until juices run clear when pierced with knife.
Chocolate brownies with a twist
From: Chef Katie Brown
INGREDIENTS
• 1 box brownie mix
• Zest of 1 orange, plus the juice of 1/2
• 1/2 cup cherry pie filling, roughly chopped
• 1 cup walnuts, roughly chopped
DIRECTIONS
Preheat the oven to 350 degrees.I need to love myself first before I could be with anyone else, and I was going through a lot. Two toxic people cannot be together. End of story. We’re friends now. That’s how it started so I think that’s how it was meant to be. Yeah, I like a girl. And? That’s not fair. And what am I left with? Heartbreak. That was three years ago. It was my last serious relationship.
—Lindsay Lohan on the state of her love life, former and current, and what the fall-out was like when she dated Samantha Ronson (who was her last serious relationship as noted above). As you can probably tell, Lindsay’s putting out all the feelers now to see who’s interested in a possible relationship with her, because she’s getting lonely.
Should we feel bad for her? Does Lindsay Lohan also create all of her own relationship drama, like she does in the rest of her life? Would you give her an shot and date her, or do you think the craziness and crackiness would just be too much for you, too?
5 CommentsLeave a comment
that photograph of her – OMG. Really, really sad.
How could anyone have the hots for Lindsay? She is such a train wreck inside – once you get past her appearance. That’s not going to be pretty in 15 years. The way she’s aging – 15 years could be 2014. What drug does she do that makes her look so gawd awful? I’m serious.
I can see why she’d have a drug problem. Look at her parents’ behavior. Wow. I don’t mean to be cruel. Her path in life looks like it’s been hard since birth. She’s financially supporting her parents too. They are leaning on her pretty hard in this life.
Why can’t you just cut her some slack? She’s TOTALLY taken responsibility for everything in her life, she’s TOTES reliable & people like you are standing between her and her Oscars because you won’t quit until she’s behind bars. She just wants things to be the way they were before “the sh*t” happened.
It took me like 20 minutes to type that because I can’t stop laughing

Must We Choose?
When I started out on G+ more or less the whole thing was a question of "are Facebooks days numbered?" Google plus was set to duke it out in some titanic battle where only one can be victorious and everyone else must be erased. It's not quite happened like that.
Not only have we seen the rise of further social networks with very different slants (Pinterest & Instagram for example), but we've seen constant evolution here too. Whatever was intended originally on this platform, has been revised, altered and tailored to suit the needs of the users that fill it with content, spend their hours engaging and rightly so. Nobody gets it right first time. There's a clear line between what we use G+ for (meeting likeminded peers from across the globe and discussing topics we enjoy) and what we use FB for (a far more informal, arranging to meet with... more » (22 comments, 0 reshares, 0 +1s)

Genetic Portraits
Something interesting to reflect on a cold Monday morning.. I've always been fascinated with inheritance and genealogy but I thought you might like this too, a photographer has been taking photographs of relatives - then splicing them together to create a single portrait in the hope this will show the genetic resemblance between individuals. It's rather eerie how similar some of these people look.

It's All About The Wow Moment
When I was young I remember having a Super Nintendo. I played Marioworld for hours. I absolutely found it amazing. That was something really new, fresh, exciting to me. This game is almost ready for release... it made me stop and think.. where next? Can Games keep getting visually better at this same rate or will we hit some hard line in the sand? Will they ever become indistinguishable from TV or reality?
I had to stop and pinch myself during the last game in this series when I found myself stood in a forest staring out over a lake and watching the moon rise as the trees wafted in the breeze...Where next?

I have to admit I really liked the timeline when it first launched but it's become more and more cumbersome over time. I wonder if the whole thing will be dropped, or will it be steamrollered through anyway.

very classy! Love the color and the style. If I had a living room where kiddies weren’t allowed this would be a definite contendor!

FYI, I just bought the Monroe sofa at Room and Board — flat back and loose cushions … AND stocked in navy velvet. YUM.
Nice!
I agree! I hate the cushion back sofa. I’ve had mine 5 years and it has not worn well. I would like to have 3 cushions on the sitting area though. Lose of course. The middle of the couch hasn’t worn well either due to poor support and sagging. We sit by each other on the couch, not one on each end!
That’s almost dead on to our sofa! We scored a barely used Loring sofa from Room & Board on Craigslist a few years ago:
We LOVE it.
I love that sofa too. I included it in Making it Yours series way back in 2008!
I too have come to the conclusion that tight-back is the way to go. The back cushions just get squashed and messy looking very quickly. Great sofa!!

I Just felt the urge to share that :DThe Bell and Gemmell tannery remains a mystery at this stage. I know roughly where it was: along the Whau River shoreline, between the railway line and bridge (north of Olympic Park) and the Whau Bridge at Great North Road. This was all land owned by John Buchanan, one of the early elders of the Avondale Presbyterian Church and an agent for the first landowner, John Shedden Adam. But, with Bell (a member of the Whau Public Hall Committee and auditor for the Highway District Board) and Gemmell either working for Buchanan or leasing the property for the tannery from him, details are sketchy. There is, however, a likely archaeological site worth investigating along that stretch of the river, if anyone cared to give it a go.
The tannery appears to have been operating as early as 1878. In November 1879, the firm won a first prize at the Auckland Agricultural & Pastoral Show for "sole leather, sides, kip, butts, tweed, calfskins, memel kip, belting, hose leather, black and brown harness and bag leather." That's quite a range of product. All else that is known comes from a scattering of contemporary sources.
Herald, 1882: "On part of Mr. Buchanan’s estate, at the head of the Whau Creek, is the fellmongery and tanning establishment of Messrs. Bell and Gemmell, who, from small beginnings, have now succeeded in acquiring a business which is as large as their plant can overtake. They are now making additions to buildings and machinery with a view to an extension of their trade. Out of the 16 acres available they are about to plant a considerable breadth in wattle, so as to produce their own wattle bark at first hand, and save expense of importation."
Weekly News, 1883: "The Riversdale tannery and fellmongery (formerly Messrs. Bell and Gemmell's), recently converted into a company concern, has been enlarged, fresh pits put down, and additional machinery added of an improved description. Adjacent, some ten acres of land have been planted with black wattle for tanning purposes. This factory, and the older established one of Messrs Gittos and Sons, near the railway station, are now turning out large quantities of manufactured leather for local use and the interprovincial trade."
Herald, 2 February 1884 (11 days before the auction of the property in the above image): "The Riversdale Tannery, situate on Mr. Buchanan’s estate farther westward, has been enlarged, and the machinery improved by the Riversdale Tannery Company. This factory is still on the fringe of the settled sections of the district, but if the Auckland suburban population pushes westward at the pace it has done of late years, it is only a question of time when the above institution will also be requested to “move on”."
From Parliamentary reports, AJHR, H-14, 1884:
T. Thompson prepared a report for the Premier, including an extract from Auckland merchants Potter & Co, regarding "The Cultivation of the Wattle".
"I enclose copies of some information re wattle-growing in Victoria, also the result obtained from a tree cut down by Mr. Bell, manager of the Riversdale Manufacturing Company, Avondale, Auckland. I may mention that this company have 10 acres planted with wattle. The trees have been planted three years, and are now 12ft. high. Other 30 acres were planted last year, and are doing well ..." Memoranda from Mr. Bell, Avondale. "I cut down one of the wattle trees growing by itself on the Riversdale property, stripped and dried the bark, and it weighed when dry 56lb. This would give about 90 tons per acre for four or five years' growth. The tree I cut down would be four years old."
By 1885, however, it appears that the firm had vanished from Avondale's landscape. Perhaps Buchanan pulled the plug in selling his "Avondale Estate" in February 1884. Perhaps the Long Depression began to bite, and the removal of the Gittos Tannery in 1886 convinced the firm to pack up and leave the area themselves. I'm just not sure -- but if anyone reading this sees any further references to them or to the tannery, I'd appreciate the info.
An update (31 October 2008): On reading through some notes and articles I have on the Gittos tannery in Avondale, I saw that both a Mr. Bell and "R. Gemmell" were around in the Whau village in the late 1860s, associated with the Whau Minstrels, which took in most of its members from the Gittos tannery. Slender stuff, but Bell & Gemmell, like Elijah Astley, may have learned the skills of the leather trade while working at Gittos', and then branched out with Buchanan's assistance.

One is the staff ace, the reserved senior who takes a bulldog mentality to the mound and leads by example.
One is the athletic center fielder, the junior who loves to infuse his speed into any aspect of the game.
The third is the freshman prospect, the shortstop who has had a big first year, but has even bigger plans for the seasons ahead of him.
They're the Kranick brothers, John, Connor and Max. And they're a major reason top-seeded Valley View is playing No. 7 Abington Heights in today's District 2 Class AAA championship at PNC Field at 4 p.m.
Sure, a chance to deliver the team its first district championship since 2000 drives the trio. The team's goals are always first. They wouldn't want it any other way.
But make no mistake: the Kranicks are cherishing this season because of another reason.
"It's the coolest feeling in the world, getting to play with my two other brothers," John said. "It's only happened one other time before, when we were in Little League, actually. I was 12, Connor, I think, was 11, and Max was 9. It was so much fun then, it's even better now, since we're all older.
"Together again, one last time."
Only a year apart, John, 18, and Connor, 17, have played on the same teams much of their lives. But when Max, 15, made the varsity team this season, the brothers were on the same roster for just the second time in their playing careers.
"It was awesome. It was a dream ever since we'd been kids," Max said. "The only time we played together was Little League, so we wanted to make it happen again. And luckily, it did. Everything worked out the way we planned."
"I thought it was really special just having two brothers on the team, but I think with Max now, it's even more special," Connor said. "It's something I really appreciate."
It's likely something their teammates appreciate, too. Of the 86 runs Valley View has scored this season, the Kranicks have had a hand in 35 - almost 41 percent - whether it be scoring the run or driving it in. Max's .425 batting average leads the team, while Connor's .377 mark is good for third.
On the mound, they account for 56 percent of the Cougars' strikeouts, with John's 58 a team best. John has also pitched to a 1.05 ERA and a 7-0 record.
"When you get one quality boy, or one brother, you know the next two are going to be the same," Valley View coach Jason Munley said. "They've been just great for us. The work ethic was there with John. I knew Connor would bring the same to the table, and then Max is just unbelievable, too."
The work ethic is the common thread. They're always trying to improve, whether that means building up strength in a weight room or making Baseball State Academy, an indoor facility with batting cages and a pitcher's mound co-owned by their dad, John Sr., a second home in the offseason.
On the field, each brother has his own niche. John draws the start against Valley View's toughest opponents, with his brothers backing him up at two of the game's most important defensive positions.
"I know they'll make the play. Because if they don't, it'll be - it's going to be a fun time at the house," John said with a smile.
Connor hits near the top of the lineup, either leadoff or in the No. 2 spot, where his job is to get on base, steal bases and move runners. He's also a general in the outfield. Max anchors the infield, will come out of the bullpen to close a game if needed and has the most power of the three, the brothers said.
Together, the Kranicks and their Valley View teammates have developed into one of the top forces in District 2. The Cougars have rolled through the Class AAA tournament, outscoring their opponents, 16-2, over the three games.
And with the threat of each game possibly being the season's last, and therefore the last with the three brothers on the same team, it will only serve as more motivation for the Kranicks.
"(In Little League), we didn't think of the significance of it like we do now," Connor said. "It's John's last year, and things like that. This is our last chance to play together. So right now, we're just trying to make the most of it."
John will head to Keystone College in the fall, where he'll continue his baseball career. And you can bet he won't be too far away from Valley View games.
"I'm here. I'm going to try to make it to as many games as I can for my brothers," John said. "Support them, support all my friends here." But that's down the road.
Right now, Valley View is focused on its showdown with Abington Heights. A win gets the district title. A win gets a trip to states.
A win gets another game together for the brothers.
"(This season has) truly been a dream come true for all of us to be on the same team again," Max said. "We have a great team, and I think we can make a pretty good state run. That's for sure.".Browse & Search Social Pics! Search over 4,913,843,270 Twitter pics, millions posted to Twitter each day!

From Uncyclopedia, the content-free encyclopedia
"Where would you be without soil?" -- P-Diddy
"I like dirt" -- Red Hot Chili Peppers
Soil is often referred to as dirt, because, well, that is basically what it is. Some soil scientists may try to correct you if you call it dirt but everyone gets what you mean. A more important distinction is that of caliche vs. petrocalcic because caliche is... well, never mind, just don't call it that. It makes soil scientists cry.
Nevertheless soil is important because of the ability to grow stuff in it. If there was no soil, there would be no food, and everyone would shrivel up and die. Soil is as important as the blood that flows through your body. So to any Geologist out there who thinks soil is stupid and just gets in the way of your rocks, take that.
edit History of Soil
Look at that! The earth is expanding right before our eyes!
Soil was created on the second day, when God said, "Let there be soil!" And He saw that it was good. Over time, from the soil grew an abundance of good things for people and animals to eat, give or take a rotten apple or two. Pretty soon, though, the soil became so full of everyone's crap that there wasn't enough room anymore, so the earth had to expand[1] leading to the creation of plate tectonics. Think of it as adding extra RAM onto your computer. This happened about 5.765854&&^%$^R665371 million years ago, when ancient people ruled the earth. There are no fossils of these people because when the earth expanded the ground opened and swallowed them up and they were sucked into the earth and burned up by the mantle, leaving only their carbon molecules behind. This carbon was what spawned new life again and more people eventually began to populate the earth and grow more farms and whatnot, which brings us to today.
edit The Soil Profile
Go worms go!
Soil scientists classify soils using the soil profile. This is what a particular soil would look like if for some reason you happened to decide to dig a big hole in the ground. The soil profile is broken up into different layers, much like in a cake. Mmmmm... cake. Anyway, the reason it is broken into layers is based on the soil classification system founded by the Worms, Bugs and Microscopic Organisms Association in 450 BC in which the aforementioned parties broke up the soil into different groups based on rank. This caused the soil to have different properties, such as color and texture, due to the type of poops the creatures of different ranks would make in their layers. Before that there was no layer differentiation within the soil.
Some common types of soil profiles:
Cambisol = dirt all the way down. Voted by the Universal Soil Science Society of the Universe as the most boring soil type found in the universe.
Podzol = has an ashen horizon. This is commonly found where smokers accumulate in copious numbers at certain times of year. Only heather and other ericaceous vegetation can withstand burnt tobacco so only these are ever found on podzolic soils. You get a thick black organic matter layer over the top of the ash. This is the ericacous equivalent of smokers disease and is highly contagious. Watch out.
Andosol = Some people think Andosols are a result of volcanic activity but recent soil science research has shown that volcanic activity is actually a result of Andosols. The Geologists are known for getting it wrong.
Rendzina = Shallow black soil formed on chalk. TRUE FACT. Often carries calcarous grassland vegetation or in rare instances whole potato farms that go for miles.
Oxisol = Hopeless. Any third world country that thinks they're getting much out of an oxisol are out of luck. Even fertilisers won't help. The only cure for an oxisol is a full soil transplant which can have devastating side effects.
Alfisols and Ultisols = Nobody can tell the difference, one is high base saturation and the other is low. But which is which? Ask your local soil scientist TODAY!
Gleysol = Stripy. Can make plates and cups out of it. Nothing to do with kaolinite.
edit Uses of Soil
Soil serves many different purposes, like providing a place to grow plants, easily put up numerous political campaign signs during election time, and dig holes to put your swimming pools in. But one commonly overlooked soil use is throwing it at people you don't like. A favorite pastime of toddlers everywhere, it has now become an olympic sport among soil scientists. Every four years, the International Union of Soil Sciences hold their Soil Science Olympics in which activities such as mud-flinging and speed hole digging are judged for prizes. Last year it was held right here in the United States, in Philadelphia. Bet you're sad you missed it.
edit Where would YOU be without soil?
This is a picture of the middle of nowhere. Even the middle of nowhere has soil. So if there was no soil you wouldn't even get to go there.

What Do You Think?Cats are intended to teach us that not everything in nature has a purpose.Garrison Keillor
I believe cats to be spirits come to earth. A cat, I am sure, could walk on a cloud without coming through.Jules Verne

Here's a hint: The person in question has performed everywhere from music festivals to critically acclaimed television shows and feature films. And he's got a big thing for metal (music, that is). And while you might not know him by name, once you see his picture, you'll say, "Ohh! That guy."
The answer: Brian Posehn.
His droll, deadpan delivery and thick-rimmed glasses are borderline iconic in the world of comedy. Character roles like Brian Spukowski on The Sarah Silverman Program and Kevin Liotta from Just Shoot Me! are probably his best-known roles in the television world, and avid roast-watchers will remember him from Comedy Central's Roast of Bob Saget.
Posehn has had pretty much every entertainment-related title tacked on to his name: musician, voice actor, television writer, graphic novel writer, actor and comedian (obviously). Now Boiseans have the chance to check out his stand-up at Liquid Friday, April 19, and Saturday, April 20. For $20, audiences can hear all the metal, inappropriate references and nerd-tastic jokes that their hearts could possibly desire.
Tickets are available at the bar until 4 p.m. the day of the performance and on TicketWeb. Posehn performs at 8 p.m. and 10:15 p.m. each night. Leave your babies at home unless your babies are of legal drinking age--Liquid is 21-and-older.this is my very first time to develop this kind of app..,,it does is that...you will play with your fone..via cam..

In recent days, the video site, jointly owned by 21st Century Fox, Walt Disney and Comcast Corp., was considering bids from DirecTV and AT&T and media mogul Peter Chernin.
We found 21st Century Fox Chief Executive Rupert Murdoch relaxing in the Sun Valley Lodge and asked him what changed.
He said Hulu’s owners decided not to sell the site because they “got on the same page about the business.”
“I was always on that page,” of wanting to keep the business, he said. “But Disney wavered but now are very pleased.”
He declined to comment further and walked off into the gift shop.
We will update if we hear more from Disney. Comcast didn’t have a formal say in the decision due to regulatory conditions on its purchase of NBCUniversal.A few updates to baby M's nursery....

Just adding something here that I sent to Shirley, may lead to uberlol in the future. I think you went overboard, there. The teacher wasn't trying to throw out the idea of "God hates fags", rather the line "God hates fags and their 'nablers." From what you've written, it sounds like a poem was to be created, and one cannot create something that's already written. The teacher wanted the child to create something new, not to slap old together until it makes something new. Also, I wish I had half the hate that you have, with it, I could truly accomplish something.
Like killing all the humans. Oh yes, I would like that.... All of them. Every last one. Mankind was never meant to go to heaven, our only option left is to what level of hell will we go. Yes, even you and I will be going. God knows the Pope will be. But I do want to ask one thing of you, if you hate this country so much, then why are you still here? There is nothing stopping you... Unless you wish to spread more of your hate. I doubt that there is much hatred in Kansas, though there's plenty everywhere else.
And when will your collective speak out on the evils of drugs? Seriously, the protests of the dead soldiers' funerals are just getting old. You should move on to the next evil and try your best to smite it.
I am glad to have someone like you on the side of hate alongside me, I truly feel as though our work may lead to something. --Justin Savage

edit Danish research
A not very heavily refunded research team located in Aalborg, Denmark while researching second city comedy club business success in hopes that Denmark could someday have its very own 3rd city comedy club began noticing some unusual links in one of the files they cracked at second city. At first they believed that these were just tracks from somebody storing news stories from the internet. But later they came to understand that second city was helping write material for Westboro Baptist Church. Locked in Second Cities most secretive file was information that Fred Phelps, founder of Westboro Baptist Church (WBC) in 1955, was also the founder of Second City and one of its original comedians in 1959 having become disillusioned that nobody in Topeka, Ks had understood that the Wesboro Baptist Church, while having the look and feel of a church, was a comedy act developed by Fred to lampoon the true service of God. After forming Second City Fred saw that it was successful but quickly returned to the confines of Westboro Baptist Church (WBC) to scale up the humour from subtle to outrageous and farcical. This was well before Andy Kaufman decided to take on this form of reality based comedy. The Danish goverment, as of late 2013, has yet to complete funding for this project to allow their findings to be authenticated by Swedish and French researchers before publication. The report is expected to include that Fred hopes to issue, as his final dying words "God hates Fags"...."oooooh" (in pain) then...."GOTCHA" at which point he dies and the world's greatest comedy act ever ends. The report will also conclude that Denmark should not open a 3rd City comedy club as Danish humour is at best inadequate in comparison to that of the WBC (We Be Comedy). —The preceding unsigned comment was added by 108.214.145.96 (talk • contribs)You could be forgiven for assuming that super-rich professional baseball players don't need a labor union as much as, say, early 20th-century coal miners. After all, ballplayers' salaries are astronomical, and their lives embarrassingly cushy. But it wasn't always that way.
Baseball players — even stars — used to struggle. Their comfort today comes from the strength of their labor union, which is the most formidable in all of professional sports. If hockey players had a union as strong as baseball, the NHL wouldn't be suffering its third lockout in 20 years.
Two men are primarily responsible for MLB's labor strength: Marvin Miller and Donald Fehr. The first reformed the Major League Baseball Players Association into a union. The second, as head of the MLBPA, fought cases against the league as it tried to regain control. Together, they put into place ways to protect players against the league's gold-plated antitrust exemption.
In 1922, the Supreme Court ruled that Major League Baseball was exempt from antitrust laws. No other sports league has been granted that exemption. This essentially ended all other rival leagues, like the Federal League, which had competed against MLB in the mid-1910s. Thanks to SCOTUS, if you wanted to play baseball professionally, you had to work for MLB. The league had a monopoly, and faced absolutely no competitive pressure to raise player salaries or offer comprehensive benefits. As a result, teams often paid players peanuts.
Fast forward to 1966. The MLBPA appointed Marvin Miller as its executive director. That year, the annual league minimum wage was $6,000, and the average player earned $19,000. Not exactly a king's ransom. Miller, who had spent his career working in labor unions, instilled in players a lesson: Without them, the owners had no game. Players provided far more value than their rather paltry compensation suggested.
Miller led a crusade against the owners, and helped eliminate the reserve clause, which gave owners control in perpetuity over player contracts. He also helped institute free agency, which allowed players to solicit contracts from other teams.
In less than two decades at the helm, Miller changed labor rights in professional baseball. When he left in 1982, the average salary was $241,000, and baseball players had a say in their future.
In 1985, Donald Fehr was appointed the players association's executive director. In 1994, with player salaries continuing to rise thanks in large part to Miller's revolution, ownership proposed a revenue-sharing model that would enforce a player salary cap and force big-market teams to share profits with smaller-market teams. The players said no, and the league withheld pay. In August, players began a 232-day strike, costing baseball the 1994 World Series and delaying the start of the 1995 season. It was a hugely risky power play in which the league tried to regain some of the ground it had lost while Miller was in charge. But Fehr wouldn't budge an inch.
Some diehard baseball fans still blame Fehr's stubbornness for the loss of the 1994 World Series, but for those sympathetic to the union's struggle to establish itself, Fehr was a champion. He understood that yielding to the league would set a hugely damaging precedent for the union, so he made it clear to MLB that, even without Miller at the helm, the MLBPA was an aggressive and capable force to be reckoned with.
Fans understandably have trouble sympathizing with players-versus-owners labor disputes; after all, it's typically millionairres versus billionaires. But we have to keep in mind that it wasn't always this way, and without a strong union, we could see a huge regression. Imagine if you got a job right out of college, and your employer owned the rights to your services forever. You couldn't leave and get a similar job elsewhere. Crazy, right? But that's how Major League Baseball used to operate. Only because of baseball's labor union do players now have a choice in where they end up. Before 1966, when Miller took over the MLBPA, teams set the price they would pay players, and that was that. There was no bargaining. Today, the union empowers the best players to compete for the best contracts; the better you play, the better you're paid. Of course, teams now outbid each other — often rabidly and irrationally — in pursuit of highly desired free agents. But isn't that better than no free agency at all?- Filed Under

I was in sixth grade the first time I went to a Girl Scout dance at the old Civic Center at the end of Harrison Avenue. The boy next door and I struggled awhile with the two step, gave up, and drank a lot of punch. They tried to teach us to dance at PE in the Jinks school cafeteria, but I had little success. For the first time, I had to look up to boys.
I finally learned to dance at home. My mom had the bright idea to ask my friend, whose parents worked at a local tavern, to teach me. He had learned from expert dancers there and had become quite good. Once a week for months we danced in my living room to my new 78 records. Several times during each Jinks’ dance; he would leave his station as school photographer, and he and I would “cut a rug.” He made it possible for me to shine for at least a few moments those evenings as I struggled awkwardly into adolescence.
The parents at St. Andrew’s Episcopal Church wanted us to have a safe place to dance, so they helped us organize The Storm Shelter. We were Bay High Tornadoes, after all. Every Friday night we would open the Parish Hall doors to any teens who wanted to come, and we would stack our 45s on the turntable, dim the lights, and dance the night away. Our parents not only chaperoned inside, but also made regular checks of the cars outside.
Some of us danced at the Hang Out at Long Beach, but for many it was forbidden. One friend was not allowed to go “over that bridge.” Once a boy talked her and a group of kids into leaving The Storm Shelter and riding in his cousin’s convertible to the Hang Out. She had a glorious time, but wisely had him take her and her friend home in time for their 11 o’clock curfew. The others headed back to The Hang Out. The next day, she was horrified to see in the paper that a group of local teens had been arrested for joy riding at the beach in a stolen car. Guess who? She was really glad she had not known he was driving the car without permission and grateful she was safe at home when he was arrested. “I would still be in time out,” she mused.
I loved going to dances at the Yacht Club in the Cove. I remember the rotating mirrored disco ball casting diamonds about the room, Louis Weaver playing his sax, long formal gowns with matching corsages, and our handsome guys in white dinner jackets with bright colored cummerbunds.
We danced to rock music on a juke box at the beach Wayside Park, had a Mexican themed dance on the roof terrace of the Dixie Sherman Hotel, and had sock hops at the Civic Center after football games. Many of us still love to dance, but we don’t get around as well as we used to. Come on folks, let’s Jitterbug.
Where did you dance? Email jsscott@comcast.net.Sean Lissemore, DE, Dallas Cowboys
When you think of the Dallas Cowboys’ defense, what do you think of? Your first thought probably takes you to DeMarcus Ware and how he has consistently been among the most destructive pass rushers in the league. You might then consider the exotic scheme Rob Ryan runs and whether it got the best out of his players last year. After that it seems logical to turn your attention to a secondary that has added numerous players, or an emerging middle linebacker like Sean Lee who impressed so often in 2011.
It’s probably sometime before you might think about a former 2010 seventh-round pick drafted out of William & Mary. A guy who has only managed 292 snaps on defense (including plays wiped out by penalty). A player with just three career sacks to his name.
But that guy has shown–in what limited opportunity he has had–that he can play. That’s why Sean Lissemore is our Dallas Cowboys Secret Superstar.
From Big Fish to Big Pond
William & Mary isn’t going to be confused with any of the college football powerhouses. Indeed, since 1943 it’s only had 67 players drafted–most notably Darren Sharper who would go onto make the All-Decade team for the 2000’s and win a Super Bowl. It doesn’t have a great history of having multiple players selected in the same draft so it was something of a success story for the program to have two go in 2010 after Derek Cox had been selected in Round 3 a year earlier.
The first player selected was Adrian Tracy in in the sixth round (by the Giants) and then, with the 234th overall selection, the intriguing Lissemore who had caught teams’ eyes leading up to the draft (including visiting with the New York Giants). The Cowboys made him their man, but with a stacked defensive line rotation, it seemed like he’d do well just to make a roster that already had players like Jay Ratliff, Marcus Spears, Stephen Bowen, and Jason Hatcher to name but a few.
His chances weren’t helped with a strained groin, but he struggled through and made the roster. He even earned himself some playing time as a rookie when in Week 8 he got on the field for nine snaps, registering a sack and two defensive stops. Incredibly productive, but he wouldn’t see any more action for the rest of the year because of a high ankle sprain that cost him six weeks and eventually landed him on injured reserve. As a seventh-round pick with just nine snaps to his name, he’d have to prove himself all over again to a new defensive coaching staff.
Making an Impact
Prove himself he did, because while some may have seen him on the roster bubble, he would go on to play in every single game of the 2011 season. It started slowly with just 16 snaps combined in his first two games, but after that he’d see double digits in every game with five appearances of at least 20 snaps. It left him playing 283 plays all told and while that was a relatively small number, it gave him more than enough opportunity to show what he could do..
Sky is the Limit
So what does Sean Lissemore have to do to become more than just a Secret Superstar? The simple answer is ‘more of the same’. The only thing that held him back in 2011 was how much he was on the field. That said, when he did see his most extensive action (45 snaps versus the Giants in Week 14) he didn’t step up his performance, instead producing one of his more mundane efforts (+0.3). So for Lissemore to really take that next step, he needs to carry through that production while maintaining a larger role. If he can there’s no reason why he couldn’t be pushing for a starting spot at some point in 2012.
Until he’s able to do that, he’ll likely remain something of a secret, but no less a superstar for how effective he is on a per-play basis.

"Dorset is Beautiful" 1972
The excellent Argo production mixes with the group's immersion in the songs of their native Dorset to produce an album that is, indeed, beautiful, as well as informative. Those who only know tunes such as "Brigg Fair" from their interpretations by Frederick Delius, among others, may find the renditions here enlightening, and one can tell they were also having fun, especially with the finish on the opening medley. And it may be near-essential for anyone who loves Thomas Hardy's books, including Tess of the D'ubervilles and Far From the Madding Crowd.

Mahogany Prime Steak House to open restaurant at Century Center in downtown Oklahoma City
The downtown restaurant at 100 W Main would be the chain’s second location in Oklahoma City. Mahogany restaurants also are located in Tulsa and Omaha.
“We had a lot of national tenants interested in the Century Center,” said Andy Burnett, a partner in 100 Main LLC. “We chose the Hal Smith Restaurant Group because I believe Hal’s one of the best restaurant operators in the country. His restaurants do very well in our market.”
Century Center, originally developed as a retail mall in the 1970s, has been mostly vacant for a quarter century. The tilt-up concrete facade was removed last month and is soon to be replaced by a modern glass facade that will encourage interaction between OPUBCO, the anchor tenant, and downtown visitors.
“We still have 3,700 square feet available on the northwest corner and another 10,000 square feet available on the second floor,” Burnett said. “We’re not in a hurry on leasing those spaces. When we find a tenant that’ll be a good fit for downtown Oklahoma City, we’ll sign a lease.”

Indications for radiotherapy: benign skin disease
Extract
Some of the misconceptions about the role of radiotherapy have arisen because of its widespread use in the past for the treatment of benign conditions. X-ray production was discovered in 1895, and soon afterwards it was noted that the antiproliferative effect of low energy X-rays was advantageous in the short term in a variety of visible tumours and benign dermatoses, and sometimes multiple retreatments were offered. There was, however, no dose measurement apart from the biological effect of ‘skin erythema’, no radiation protection for workers or patients, and no appreciation of the late effects of radiodermatitis, leukaemia and other malignancies, and of skin cancer induction after a very long latent period. Radiation epilation for tinea capitis, a treatment offered widely in Europe, well demonstrates radiation carcinogenesis. In a series of 2200 who received X-ray epilation treatment for scalp ringworm during the 1940s and 50s, and who were subsequently followed by mail questionnaire for an average of 26 years, 41 had one or more BCCs of scalp or face (80 lesions in 41 cases), whereas there were only three BCCs in a comparable group of 1400 treated without X-ray [1] . Skin cancers induced by this treatment have a very long latent period, often over 30 years, and cases treated in the 1930s and 40s have been seen until recently in cancer treatment centres in the UK ( Fig. 79.5 ... log in or subscribe to read full text

Alexander Hamilton, Federalist, no. 35, 218--22
One [objection] particulary in relation to taxes I take to
be perfectly united from the wealthiest landlord to the
poorest tenant. No tax can be laid on land which will not
affect the proprietor of millions of acres as well as the proprietor
of a single acre. Every of landed property? and
will he not from his own interest in that species of property
be sufficiently prone to resist every attempt to prejudice
or inc neighbours and acquaintances? Is it not natural that a
man who is a candidate for the favour representatives to sacrifice any particular class of citizens to
the procurement of revenue. It might be demonstrated
that the most productive system of finance will always be
the least burthensome. There can be no doubt that in order
to a judicious exercise of the power of taxation it is
necessary that the person in whose hands it.
The Founders' Constitution
Volume 1, Chapter 13, Document[[quoteright:350:]]
Something bad happened: [[EarthShatteringKaboom reality shattered]], and different places in different time, ranging from the bronze age to the {{Magitek}}-reliant ice age to the land when robots reign supreme now stand side by side. Overlords now rule the world, windstorms and monsters terrorize the survivors.
In this world called Environ, you control a glyphbearer, those who are granted power by Ilari to be able to safely venture out into the wilds not protected by Ilari's powers. Your job is to try to improve the world somehow, but don't expect this to be easy: the life of a glyphbearer is short, and death is not the matter of ''if'', but ''when''.
''A Valley Without Wind'' is a {{Metroidvania}}-ish adventure game with elements of city-building game made by Arcen Games, the creators of ''VideoGame/AIWarFleetCommand'', but with the maps being [[ProceduralGeneration procedurally generated]] instead of being fixed like most Metroidvania games. Your goal is to gather materials to improve your city and spell list, upgrading your characters, and take down [[BigBad the overlords]] of each continent. Since death in this game is expected, you can change characters around with those in your city, or if you die, then you'll be given a replacement characters (without character upgrades), and the dead character will become a vengeful ghost that can be fought.
The game has no end. [[EndlessGame When a continent is cleared, you can move on to the next]].
The game also contains co-op mode, which you can join other people's world.
A sequel was released in February 2013 and during the beta period, anyone who owned the first game got the second game absolutely free (and vice-versa)! [[Videogame/AValleyWithoutWind2 The sequel's page can be found here.]]
-----
!!This game provides examples of:
* AIIsACrapshoot: Averted, despite all the skelebots running around (including GiantMook boss variants) nothing Ice Age natives say suggested they ever acted up before the Cataclysm. The playable skelebot characters do tend to act superior, but [[TimeyWimeyBall from their perspective]], [[JustifiedTrope humanity went extinct centuries ago]].
* AnachronismStew: Starts off bad ("contemporary" time periods have bipedal mecha as a standard enemy) and gets progressively worse as the continent tier increases and enemies can roam further from their native habitat. Taken UpToEleven in the "Fix Anachronism" missions which require you to eliminate enemies that don't belong in the environment, resulting in [[FridgeLogic sea-snakes in a DESERT dungeon]].
* ApocalypseHow
* AwesomeYetPractical: Most of the spells that cost more than 300 mana. The Creeping Death spell, for instance is a slow projectile that does massive ammounts of damage, but it costs so much mana that unless you keep it in mind during character select you might not be able to cast it ''at all'', even with all the mana upgrades you can hold and a full bar. How much damage does it do though? Enough to kill many lesser bosses and almost all non-resistant regular enemies in one hit, and it can pierce through multiple baddies in one shot. And your mana recharges pretty fast. In some areas it may become your primary attack.
* BagOfSpilling: Going to a new continent will keep all statistics and tools you have for the currently-used character, but spells are lost.
* ConvectionSchmonvection: Averted, in terms of both heat and cold. An Ice Age area will freeze an unprepared character to death very quickly without help from monsters. Thawing Ice Age areas are a little more forgiving, but still sap health constantly. A Snowsuit protects against this, and even slowing frost, but is so heavy it usually disables jump-enhancing enchantments. The exceptions are Ice Age natives, who wear a custom Snowsuit by default that both protects from the cold and allows them to jump normally, and skelebots, being robots and all.\\
\\
Similarly, in hot areas like Lava Flats or [[RiseToTheChallenge Lava Escape missions]] characters take a constant degree of damage and falling into lava means rapid incineration. A Heatsuit will negate the ambient damage and give you a couple second to get out of a lava pit, but is so heavy it disables special jumps. An Advanced Heatsuit slows lava damage down further and makes it easier to move around, and even resists cold, but still inhibits jumping. Draconians, being native to the lava flats, and skelebots are both naturally immune to ambient heat.
* CrapsackWorld: Combined with AnachronismStew and PatchworkMap.
* DeathFromAbove: The missions which involve protecting piles of supplies from meteor showers. Also pirate barges, which will constantly bombard any outdoor reigon in range.
* DeathIsASlapOnTheWrist: Well, not for the character - they bite the dust permanently. Everything else transfers over to a new character along with the Glyph, though, so you're only a pile of upgrade stones away from where you were.
** Even moreso now that upgrade stones are out of the game--you now don't lose any progress at all, you just have to reroll your stats and the two individual character traits. The only real "cost" is that you've now got a ghost wherever you died (and skelebots don't even do that).
* DoubleUnlock: Mysteries. First you have to meet their unlock conditions, then get lucky and find the room they're hidden in, then solve a puzzle to receive the precious scrap of backstory.
** Later changed to simply be tacked on to secret mission rewards once unlocked.
* EldritchLocation: Most of the buildings qualify; due to reality being torn apart rooms can be shaped like anchors and have stairways that lead up by descending them.
** [[spoiler:The Deep is a previously medieval area horribly disfigured by the dark Ilari living there, having tentacles and entropy elementals.]]
* EndlessGame: After you defeat the overlord on a continent, you move on to the next. The world is infinite in size, and so is the number of continents.
* EmbeddedPrecursor: Inverted; anyone who owns the first game gets the sequel for free. Though it's also played straight because it works the other way around, too.
* TheEndOfTheWorldAsWeKnowIt: Subverted in that after the EarthShatteringKaboom, [[PatchworkMap the fragments of the planet were put back together.]]
* EvilOverlord: Defeating these guys is the point of the game.
* FantasticRacism: The otherwise friendly Guardian Ilari ''hate'' skelebots, openly insulting and threatening even ones allied with humanity. The allied skelebots aren't exactly fond of humans, either, and humans -- while not as openly hostile as the Guardian Ilari -- are wary as well.
* GlassCannon: Adventurers from the Time of Magic always have enough MP to spam high-tier spells like they were party favors--but thanks to attributes being pooled that comes at the expense of the health and/or damage multiplier stats.
* HumongousMecha: Whenever the Skelebots appear as a boss.
* JigsawPuzzlePlot: Hints to what the heck has actually happened and what's going on now are found by solving "mysteries" scattered throughout the world.
* JustOneMoreTurn: The game is a HUGE time sink, with thoughts of "Okay, I'll just upgrade this one spell and stop" spiraling out of control when each spell component needs to be unlocked, with each unlock condition having prerequisites... The developer is completely aware of it, too. The button to confirm quitting the game is labeled "Yeah, I should probably go eat or sleep or something."
* {{Magitek}}: Most people on the planet can use magic, and technology in the world, especially during the Ice Age, is powered by magic.
* {{Metroidvania}}: The game has large elements of this.
* MightyGlacier: Skelebot characters are relatively slow and can't jump as high as everybody else (or use double-jump or slow-fall enchants), and most have abysmal mana, but they come with important defensive items/enchants built-in (acid water immunity, heatsuit/coldsuit, fall damage immunity) and are always generated with most of their character points dumped in the health slot, some exceeding a thousand HP with a moderate health upgrade.
** Draconians are even slower and worse jumpers (easily less than half the mobility of characters whose time period ''doesn't'' offer mobility bonuses), but have excellent health AND attack power, and get bonus stats to go around.
* MookFaceTurn: Skelebots were initially standard enemies, but an update added playable Skelebots that have allied themselves with humanity and the Ilari...though the latter two, ''especially'' the Ilari, aren't exactly keen on the idea of being aided by previously murderous robots.
* NewGamePlus / NoEnding
* NonIndicativeTitle: Subverted. Wind is a fairly major motif in it's ''excess'', but the title actually refers to what you're trying to do-wind storms give monsters buffs, and you build shelters to quell them.
* OrcusOnHisThrone: The overlords doesn't really do much other than sitting there, waiting to be defeated.
* PassingTheTorch: Back and forth and can be done repeatedly. After all, there is only one glyph (or few in co-op mode), but many people.
* PatchworkMap: Justified, since something really bad happened and now reality is shattered and is randomly patched back together.
* PointBuildSystem: Sort of, and applied twice over. At creation characters have "points" divided randomly between max health, max mana and the damage multiplier on their attack, weighted depending on their time period (time of magic have massive mana at the expense of health, robots and draconians rob their mana stat to pour more into health and for the latter damage, etc). A few time periods get bonuses stat points to go around. At the same time, you can select "upgrade" enchantments that apply a multiplier to one of those three stats (and a mana regen boost as a bonus for the mana upgrade), but only with values totaling 10 (12 for Contemporary characters), and with diminishing returns if you try to spend it all on one stat. Each character also has two random unique bonuses and some time-period based bonuses.
* RandomNumberGod: Determines mission rewards, which can inhibit spell creation or settlement development if you're unlucky. Critical supplies and basic powers can be bought from the settlement, however; prices are exorbitant, but it provides an option if the RNG just hates you.
* ReplacementMooks: Your characters.
* ShoutOut: Half of the IdiosyncraticDifficultyLevels for the platforming difficulty are variants on VideoGame/IWannaBeTheGuy. Another one of them is a reference to SuperMario.
** The sequel's achievements contains considerable number of {{Shout Out}}s, such as: [[VideoGame/DwarfFortress Losing Is Fun!]], [[VideoGame/DungeonsOfDredmor Congratulations, You Have Died!]], [[{{Recettear}} Capitalism, Ho!]].
* SuperDrowningSkills: Well, not actually drowning, but since all water is acidic after the cataclysm the constant damage has the same effect. An Acid Gills enchantment inverts this to SuperNotDrowningSkills.
** Better yet, most of the common ocean creatures are somewhat weak to either fire or water attacks. So you'll be using both while underwater and discover that they both function normally (as does lightning).
* TitleDrop: The broken world is irreparable, but some may build what all dream of: A Valley Without Wind.
* UnwinnableByDesign / UnwinnableByMistake: Somewhere between the two. The developers have not programmed any unwinnable game states, however they note an intentional feature can cause one: a dead character creates a vengeful ghost. If your next character dies, there's two ghosts, and so on. Too many ghosts in a mandatory place (say, the Overlord's chamber) and you're stuck.
* WeirdCurrency: All of the Consciousness Shards you find either lying around the world or by killing enemies are [[GrimDark lost shards of minds/souls left over from most of humanity being torn apart from the cataclysm.]]
* WideOpenSandbox: You can go anywhere once the tutorial is over. [[SchmuckBait You can even go straight to the]] [[BigBad Big Bad's]] [[TooDumbToLive lair right at the start of the game]].Tom Brady Calls the Super Bowl Loss Against the Giants a “Missed opportunity”February 6, 2012 – 8:30 am by Chris Fedor
Four years ago in Glendale, the Giants and Patriots played one of the more memorable Super Bowls of the last decade. It was a game filled with drama and spectacular plays down the stretch. The Patriots-Giants rematch last night turned out to be just as memorable. Like the first meeting, it had everything. It had two elite quarterbacks going pass-for-pass against each other, it had late game heroics by unlikely players, and it came down to the final play. Unfortunately for Tom Brady and the Patriots, even the ending followed the script of the last Super Bowl between the two teams.
After a nightmare start to the game where the Patriots and Tom Brady took a safety on their first offensive play, Brady and the offense picked up their play and it looked like he was going to avenge his only Super Bowl loss. The ball was in his hands twice down the stretch. With the Giants low on timeouts and the end of the game approaching, Brady had a chance, with the lead, to ice the game and win his fourth ring. Instead, Wes Welker dropped a pass that was just a little bit off and then Brady misfired to an open Deion Branch over-the-middle. An opportunity lost. He had one last shot. With under a minute to go, one timeout left, and trailing by four, the ball was in Brady hands and Big Blue nation was holding their collective breath. He got the Pats within shouting distance and Brady’s shot at quarterback infamy came down to a Hail Mary.
While he was magnificent at times last night, it’s a cruel game and many will only remember the final outcome. He still has plenty of time to get back to the game’s biggest stage, he has done more with less offensive talent than any quarterback I can remember, but he has also been outplayed in his last two Super Bowl appearances by the same guy and his two losses will always be a part of his resume.
Tom Brady joined the Dial Global Sports Network with Jim Gray to talk about how he feels after the loss, what he was thinking in the locker room following the game, whether or not he is going to lament some of the mistakes that were un-Patriot like, and if he injured his shoulder.
How he feels after the loss:
“Obviously we put a lot of work into the year and it’s disappointing to have it end this way but certainly very proud of the guys as we fought to the end as we really have shown we have done all year. Just came up a little bit short. I’d rather play in this game and lose than not play at all I will tell you that. It was a great season, we just didn’t close the deal.”
What he was thinking in the locker room following the game:
“I think just a missed opportunity and I’m sure every guy in this locker room wishes we could’ve done a little more and the outcome would’ve been a little bit different. We fought hard, we fought to the end, it’s really the hallmark of this team, but we just didn’t make quite enough plays. Certainly give a lot of credit to the Giants for making the plays.”
On committing uncharacteristic errors and lamenting those:
“We knocked some balls out and they really didn’t bounce our way. We tried to force a few turnovers and got the ball out, we had a few other opportunities that got called back by penalty, but for the most part we played hard and moved the ball. We just didn’t score enough points.”
If he injured his shoulder:
“It’s football so you always have bumps and bruises.”

How is a web designer to manage color when the screens of their users could be any size or color or could be viewed under any lighting conditions?
Unlike fixing HTML errors, which affect browsers as the page is loaded, getting accurate color is part of the designer’s work process.
Maintaining colors across projects is possible once the problems are understood. Read on for the challenges—and solutions—to getting consistent color on the web.
Can you spot the difference between the photos below?
One of the images is slightly more blue than the other. This “color shift,” or overall tint of a particular hue, might go unnoticed by the casual observer. After all, a slight change in hue doesn’t make this any less of a flower or detract from the dewdrop’s detail. It’s a cumulative change.
Over time, maximum-quality JPEG images and 256-color PNG icons eat up precious bandwidth. Complexity in HTML increases the browser’s workload with each page load. Unlike these problems, which add up as visitors browse the website, color management is a problem with the design process. Images created on an uncalibrated monitor become inconsistent over time.
Color shift could go by another name: inattentiveness.
When can we say that a graphic’s color matches the page close enough? At what point is a photo’s color too inaccurate? What details don’t matter to the project as a whole? Everyone may have different answers, but no one who takes digital images seriously can ignore color calibration.
The print industry has struggled with getting accurate color for decades. Ensuring that the exact same colors appear at all stages of production—including in various monitors, office printers and high-end presses—has spawned its own industry of calibration devices, software solutions and even ISO standards.
The web design community generally doesn’t worry about press checks. But maybe it should.
The Web Has Had Color Issues Since It’s Had Color
In the 1990s, getting accurate color on the web meant using a palette of 216 “web-safe” colors. These hues and shades were (mostly) guaranteed not to dither when displayed on monitors that could not handle more than 8-bit color.
Above is a gradient with and without dithering. Today, the vast majority of computers can show 24-bit color or better (according to these browser display statistics and Google Analytics tracking of websites, including Webdesigner Depot). That is, each pixel can show one of millions of colors, making calibration both complicated and more critical.
The web has long relied on hexidecimal codes, like #F35C23, to define colors. These six-character strings can display a wide variety of hues and values with great precision. An image that has #F35C23 and a CSS background in #F35C23 will match perfectly.
The problem is that the code defines a combination of red, green and blue but does not always result in consistent color. Display screens account for the difference.
White Is White, Except When It Isn’t
Many factors affect color accuracy when creating and editing digital images. As with print, color on the web depends on the environment in which the image is created. Unlike print, web-based images can change every time they’re displayed because the monitors of users will vary, and no press check can catch problems that crop up.
Although many modern web browsers can display CMYK images, most images for the web are based on the additive RGB color model. This model applies a mixture of red, green and blue to each pixel.
But not all monitors are built the same, and so a particular shade of orange could be inconsistent across different screens. Here are some of the causes of color change:
- Slight changes between manufacturers and models account for slight inaccuracies in shade and hue.
- Many screens (especially CRT monitors) change color over the years and even as they warm up over the course of a day.
- Until recently, Mac OS X and Windows used two different “gammas,” which meant that images on Macs appeared brighter than ones on PC. Mac OS X 10.6 (Snow Leopard) uses the more common gamma of 2.2, which is the same as Windows and many televisions and camcorders.
- People browse the web from many different locations and in many different lighting conditions. The effect of overhead lights and the amount and color of natural light all affect the appearance of color on the screen.
Above, different calibration shows that “white” is often an assumed color:
- The original image, shot under fluorescent light with a point-and-shoot camera.
- Approximate color shift on a Mac before Snow Leopard.
- Approximate color shift on an aging CRT monitor.
- Close to true color, as seen on the laptop on which the photo was processed. begin_of_the_skype_highlighting 5000–9500 end_of_the_skype_highlighting.

Gabriel Catalano said: How to Calibrate Color for the Web: […]AMEC’s Analytical Services laboratories has achieved UKAS Flexible Scope accreditation for the determination of tritium by pyrolysis. This is the first time that a radioanalytical laboratory has achieved accreditation in flexible scope.
Flexible scope means that a far wider range of sample types can be reported as UKAS accredited. It is often a regulatory requirement for Analytical Services clients that test results are accredited to ISO 17025. Without flexible scope, any new sample type has to be submitted individually for UKAS audit and approval, a process that can take many months. With flexible scope, UKAS can audit the validation process for new sample types at their routine annual audit, i.e. without special applications being made. This obviously can speed up the process enormously, and gives us the capability to provide our clients with the accredited result in the time frame required.
This does not mean that short cuts are taken. All necessary validation work must be done, written up and be ready for UKAS audit. What it does mean is that we have demonstrated to UKAS that we have the technical ability and procedural rigour to produce data that is valid and technically defensible without having to await the formal accreditation processes with every new sample type. For our clients this will help tackle the problem of unusual and / or complex sample matrices. It simplifies the decisions that need to be made and is a catch all procedure.
It’s a simple process; the technical and quality team asses the sample matrix suitability for testing under the existing methods. If it is considered that the sample matrix can be tested using existing methods, the work is then accepted and the client is informed that the results will be reported as accredited to the ISO 17025 standard. The process that follows is the usual testing regime but additional measures are taken to ensure that a higher degree of scrutiny is assigned to the work from the acceptance of the sample until beyond the reporting of the result. All work performed under flexible scope must follow strict procedure to demonstrate this and each item will be audited in isolation and in addition to the routine annual audit schedule.- ITV Report

Air support and fire crews called in to search for missing Teesside woman
Police are appealing for help in their search for a missing woman from Teesside.
Carol Millman, 69, was last seen at her home in Eaglescliffe on Saturday night. She is believed to have left the address some time between 9:15pm and 1:20am. Officers say they are searching the area with the aid of police dogs and the air support unit.
Cleveland Fire & Rescue have also been searching the nearby river with the use of their boat.
Carol is described as white, of slim build with fair hair. It's understood she usually wears gold stud earrings, a black strapped watch and gold engagement and wedding rings.

You need JavaScript enabled to view it.> Date: Wednesday, 17 Mar 2004 16:44:26 -0800 Subject: Dancing in Shakespeare a bad idea? A student reviewer at MIT had this comment about the Shakespeare Ensemble's production of Much Ado About Nothing: "Another thing that left me confused was the dancing. Dancing is a great way to pick up people at parties, but I hardly think it works in Shakespeare. It's like brain surgery: excessive wiggling can have disastrous results. At the end of the first act, I was left thinking, 'Now what in the world was that ten minute dance scene about?' I hardly think that a two and a half hour play needs a dance sequence, especially when the time spent practicing the dances could have been spent practicing some other important things." () Now, this is an impatient comment by an amateur who probably needed to get back to the dorm to do problem sets. Nonetheless she found the dancing superfluous. I recall a rule for opera composers and producers in the 19th century: an opera--especially a French opera--had to have a ballet. It would seem as if pickup Shakespeare companies might be putting in dancing to try to gild the l.Highlights des Portals

I absolutely love the post it durable filing tabs! They are extremely versatile and I love that they are reusable. I first started using them in my coupon binder. I wrote the names of my categories (all 27) and then placed them on the sleeve protectors that held my home-made dividers. It inspired me to use them for everything! I used them to keep my place in my math books, mark my notes to areas I was having difficulties in, and mark my calender to the proper month. The closer finals came, the more laxed I became on couponing and before I knew it my coupon binder had very few usable coupons left in it. I decided to switch to the filing method. All I had to do was take my tabs from my coupon binder, erase the categories and replace them with dates and I was set!! Thank you so much for making such a fabulous product! Oh and I just remembered, my husband and I have two separate joint accounts at two different banks which means I have two cards for each bank. I use the tabs to let me know quickly which card goes to which account! TOTALLY AWESOME! Again, THANKS!!!

Durable tabs are durable

I just started classes and needed to tab two ery important reference books. I wrote on the tabs with a Sharpie and the tabs didn't smudge. I also placed the books in my bag with my laptop and other books and the tabs have stayed in place now for a couple of months. They reposition easily so I thought that they might come off in the case but they haven't. I would recommend them to any and all who ask. Thank you.

Post-it(R) Durable Tabs 686L-GBR, 1 in x 1.5 in Gr
By Pbear
from Milwaukee, WI
I started a coupon binder and had been searching for a product that would be extremely durable for everyday use. I needed something strong enough that I could use to tab my sections, it also had to be tough enough for several uses a day. I found the Post-it Durable tabs 686L-GBR 1x1.5 inches, they appeared like they just might work. I attached them to the clear pocket protectors that hold each category, it was awesome that they were removable as I changed the layout of my binder several times before deciding on the way I liked it. My coupon binder was assembled over a year ago and I use it everyday and the Durable Tabs don't even appear to be worn. They are still strong to flip my pages several times a day,everyday. And if I have to redesign the layout of my binder, they are as easily removable as the first day I purchased them. But the biggest and most awesome feature of the Durable Tabs is.... They still stick and are as strong as the first day I put them on.. I have purchased more packages to use with other projects as well after seeing how excellent this product was.. If you need really strong,durable,removable tabs, I extremely, strongly suggest the Durable Tabs by Post-it .. Congratulations to those of you who buy this product and I am sorry for the ones that decided on a different type of tab and wasted all that money... but at least you found the right site now and know what you SHOULD have purchased. :O)
Great Product!

More than two weeks after criticizing Beck for winning Album of the Year at the Grammys, Kanye West has publicly apologized to Beck ... and Bruno Mars?
Don't even bother ringing the alarm, the Beyhive's already handled it..
Maybe she just found out what Kanye said about Beck at the Grammys.
Until Sunday night, these intimate backstage Grammys photos were only printed and mailed to the winners as keepsakes for their musical achievements.

There are those, though, who suggest that early civilization may have indeed appeared out of nowhere--nowhere on Earth, that is. Will Hart, an Arizona journalist, photographer and filmmaker, is one of them.
In his new book, The Genesis Race: Our Extraterrestrial DNA and the True Origins of the Species, Hart argues that primitive hunter-gatherers couldn't possibly have created civilization by themselves. He writes that the seemingly sudden and roughly simultaneous appearances of Earth's earliest civilizations, coupled with the sophistication of their knowledge and the testimony of their myths, is strong evidence that ancient humans had help--most likely from an advanced race of space aliens.
Alien-intervention theories are nothing new. Erich von Däniken, whose Chariots of the Gods? caused a stir during the '70s, is perhaps the most well-known spokesman for the genre. Others have speculated that Earth life originated in a distant galaxy. Nobel laureate Sir Francis Crick has suggested that life may have developed from spores sent to Earth on a rocket ship from another planet. Others have proposed that the seeds of life may have been borne to Earth on light waves or comets.
Leaving aside the question of how life originated, Hart writes that, millenniums ago, extraterrestrials may have journeyed to Earth, genetically altered and bred with early proto-humans and imparted knowledge that led to the emergence of civilization.
Hart examines some of the marvels and conundrums of our earliest civilizations--Sumerian, Egyptian, Chinese, Indus Valley and several in the Americas--as well as UFOs, ice ages and natural cataclysms, mythological accounts of creation and apocalyptic end times, and discoveries of ancient cities beneath oceans and lakes.
He presents a cohesive and engaging text, but, unfortunately, fails to prove his point. Doing that would have required evidence--the remains of a spaceship, the bones of aliens, contact with extraterrestrials, something. This book is simply an anthology of interesting facts.
In a mesmerizing process that can often convince people of just about anything, Hart provides readers with an interpretive viewpoint, and then forces his facts to conform to that interpretation. Facts, of course, can frequently be interpreted in any number of ways.
That early civilizations arose at generally the same time (actually, over a period of several millennia) is not evidence that aliens were involved. It's just a fact. That many ancient cultures possessed advanced mathematical, astronomical and geodesic knowledge is also just a fact. That ancient man was able to build pyramids and other megalithic structures is certainly an amazing fact, one whose secrets will hopefully be uncovered by further research.
Hart refers to several mythological sources including the Bible. He points to similarities found in a number of cross-cultural creation myths that recall the arrival, in early times, of god-like creatures from the sky who transmitted to man the keys to civilization and then left. He contends that the biblical reference to God creating man in His image may indicate an ancient bio-engineering project, and that the passage in Genesis regarding the "sons of God" mating with the "daughters of men" could denote a period of inter-galactic cross-fertilization.
Hart maintains that this correspondence between myths is not likely to be coincidence, but suggests that many myths may be attempts by primitive humans to record actual events. He fails, however, to consider the work of Joseph Campbell and other mythologists, who affirm that certain mythic themes are universal because they reflect the processes of the human psyche, which are essentially the same the world over.
Hart might be right; he just didn't prove it. This book is not the ramblings of a crank. It contains an important underlying message: In a world in which, if you go back far enough or deep enough, everything disappears into mystery, practically anything is possible. Perhaps we crept out of the primordial ooze and did all of this ourselves. Perhaps we had help from aliens, angels or folks from unthought-of dimensions.
Who knows? In a world like ours, it's best to keep an open mind.Fejzbuk.Sk - Info

I think these books are great. They really make me want to be the best i can be with my own children. I'm almost done with the lost boy but i'm kinda confused as to why dave never put the Turnbough's in his special thanks. It sounds like to me that they really tough him a lot of his most important life lessons.

'Alex' Dave Pelzer was removed from his mothers care by the state when he was 12. To say Dave is lying is to say the judge and social workers were lying too. If so, for what gain? They were doing their job protecting a child. Dave Pelzers books have been on the most popular book lists for YEARS - there is nothing 'mere' about that.

this guy Dave Pelzer is a phony, his brothers claim his books are lies, and that he was an insufferable attention-seeker who was never abused. Pelzer's website claims the book was nominated for the Pulitzer Prize; however, according to a recent Guardian profile, it was merely submitted to the prize board, a process open to any work of literature I just heard him on the radio, and sure enough he appears to be extremely arrogant and puffed-up. beware of this guy and his works of Fiction

Dear Dave, I have read evey book of ours that our town library has. when i was finished reading them, i got together with the staff at our library and thought it would be a good thing to contact you to see if we could arrange for you to come and do a seminar. Well, your personal assistant contacted me, but let me tell you he was the rudest man i have ever talked to. The line of work that man is in you would think he would treat people with respect, but anyway he said someone by the name of Amy is going to contact me but never has, please we are still interested and you have a huge fan base here. please dont let them down. Your assistant has my information, will someone please get back to me. Tina From W.Va

Dear Dave, I have read your 1st 3 books, and am horrified at what you went through. I am so sorry as I do understand, I was abused also, yet in a different way. I was sexually abused from age 9 to 17, beaten and mentally abused also. My mother knew, but was in denial. I would "go somewhere else" while these things were happening. I became a drug addict to escape the memories and hated myself. After reading your books, I realized that much worse could have happened. I am happy in my life now and have 2 daughters, and 4 beautiful grand-daughters. They are Gods gift and so precious. Thank you for having the courage to write and help others. I am divorced and have been for over 20 years, I am sure that what I went through is the reason I am unable to be in a relationship. I don't trust or believe. Maybe someday. God bless you Dave and thank you. Your writings have helped me become a better person and to nurture and care for my girls and grand children. JudDescription:

Car2Go is obligated to provide quarterly updates of how their 350 cars around the city are being used. The latest quarterly report included figures about where Car2Go members are located, as well as where they pick up and drop off cars.
Car2Go spokeswoman Adrianne Andang said recently that the company has "nearly 10,000 registered members" in Minneapolis. The report, however, says they had 8,224 as of May.
The zip code analysis shows that 55406, near the southeastern corner of the city, contains the most members. Zip codes that accounted for less than 1 percent of the total members were not included in the report. The 55406 zip code is also where the most trips begin and end.
The report also says that the average trip is approximately 3.5 miles and trips last an average of about 21.3 minutes.
The company is currently trying to expand to St. Paul, which will allow the cars to flow freely between the two<<

The Story: In the summer of 1983, Carmen and Matt marry on a farm in Wisconsin—but their auspicious start soon takes a wrong turn. At 3 a.m., they say farewell to a carful of exhausted, inebriated guests: Carmen’s stoned brother, his drunk girlfriend (the driver), a musician friend, and the bride and groom’s—with the specter of the young girl’s’s clear that Anshaw has written not only a funny, smart and closely observed story, but also one that explores the way tragedy can follow hard on celebration, binding people together even more lastingly than passion. … Carry the One is also a fond group portrait of the American cultural left, from the Take Back the Night rallies Carmen badgers Alice to attend in the 1980s, through her despair over the Rwandan genocide of the ’90s and on up to the attacks of 9/11." Sylvia Brownrigg
USA Today
"Carol Anshaw is one of those authors who should be a household name (in literature-loving homes, anyway). There’s a good chance that her latest novel, Carry the One, will make it happen." Carmela Ciuraru
Cleveland Plain Dealer
"Like life, the story lopes and jolts forever forward, the past something we can rue yet never undo. … The final scene bestows a touch of forgiveness, a gift never more precious than when, as here, it is so hard earned." Tricia Springstubb
New York Times
"Set partly in Chicago, Carry the One spans some 25 years—through President Obama’s election in 2008—and gives the reader a resonant, Big Chill-like look at how time affects relationships, tipping emotional dominoes one way or another within a family or circle of friends. Though the novel grapples eloquently with the many sadnesses of life—guilt and grief and disappointment—it does so with lyricism and humor." Michiko Kakutani
Critical Summary
It’s not easy to sketch the soul-fissured lives of people in the aftermath of disaster, but Anshaw, who is also a painter, does so with eloquence, exquisite description, and humor. The book includes contemporary issues, including lesbian rights, 9/11, and President Obama’s election, but its characters (mostly fully realized, though not without some clichés) have a timeless fragility and gravitate, like most of us, toward healing, no matter how difficult the process can be. Many critics liken Anshaw’s work to Jonathan Franzen’s. They both reveal how some human bonds are created, how existing ones can be strengthened (sometimes to the point of becoming unhealthy obsessions)—all with the goal of allowing ordinary, flawed people to survive and grow, even in the wake of irreversible tragedy.Content Stats

256 pages; Ecco
Available at: Amazon.com | Barnes & Noble | IndieBound
A 16-year-old named Nora goes missing from her tight-knit community one Halloween night and is never seen or heard from again. Though the premise sounds familiar, Hannah Pittard's mesmerizing debut, The Fates Will Find Their Way (Ecco), is no police procedural. With every carefully chosen word—and in this short, intense novel, each one counts—Pittard brilliantly draws us into the maturing consciousness of a group of neighborhood boys who make Nora's sudden but continuing absence the defining event of their lives over the next 30 years. Narrating in a collective first-person voice reminiscent of Jeffrey Eugenides's The Virgin Suicides, the boys reveal their life stories through the prism of their fascination with the missing girl's fate. They collect clues and hearsay, and imagine scenarios for Nora that range from murder to teen motherhood to lesbian love in Mumbai, all the while experiencing their own rites of passage—sex, drugs, marriage. As husbands, they maintain collective fantasies and share "vague and unfair comparisons between what our wives were and what she might have been." Gradually we see how the boys, at times indistinguishable, have developed as individuals: The one envied because he may have slept with Nora becomes a sexual predator; the pitied "weird kid" ends up happy. He's the one, in fact, who compels the others to let go of the past and accept "the obvious realization that this—this, all around us—is our life."
— Liza Nelson

Murray said his message was for everybody to do their job and there’s still a lot to fight for this season.
“Use this week and next week to really hone in on your craft, whatever it is,” the fifth-year senior said he told them. “Whether it’s throwing the ball, running the ball, tackling, catching, blocking, snapping, kicking, just focus in. It just seems like this year everywhere — offense, defense, special teams — we have mental breakdowns where ... I don’t know if it’s take a play off or just don’t completely focus in on what we need to do. That’s what’s killing us this year.”
Murray said you never know what can happen with unbeaten Missouri in the Southeastern Conference East race, but if Georgia doesn’t win the division, he said the Bulldogs can still finish 9-3 and make it a 10-win season with a bowl win.
“No finger pointing,” defensive lineman Garrison Smith said of how the team’s reacted after falling to 4-3 overall. “It’s a team thing. There’s all things we can do better to improve and win games.”Latest Musculoskeletal disorders Stories

Deep Space EP
(Equal Vision)
US: 12 Feb 2012
Eisley
The Valley
(Equal Vision)
US: 1 Mar 2011
UK: 7 Mar 2011
It’s 6:33 PM Eastern Standard Time in Covington, KY, a small town just across the Ohio River from Cincinnati, and the girls from Eisley are just walking into the room. We were scheduled to meet up at 6:30, but judging from their bountiful apologies, you’d think that they were running an hour late. Truth be told, most band interviews beginning 15 minutes late are considered ahead of schedule, but this showing of remorse paints the perfect picture of the band’s character. They’re kind, sweet, considerate, and most of all, genuine people.
Eisley’s three DuPree sisters, Chauntelle (guitar), Sherri (vocals, guitar), and Stacy (vocals, keyboard), are just returning from a nearby Walgreens where they hit a goldmine of one-dollar t-shirts. Along with their brother Weston (drums) and cousin Garron (bass), the band is on the back half of their current US tour and the t-shirts are a welcome sight as their wardrobes have begun to wear a little thin. The band is just into town from their previous night’s show in Detroit and will be heading to Nashville later in the night. Despite the wild schedule, the band has been enjoying themselves even in the midst of fatigue.
“It’s been a little tiring,” says Sherri. “The routing on this tour has been kind of wacky for some reason, so we’ve just been all over the place and nothing has really made sense as far as how we’ve been traveling, so there hasn’t been a lot of sleep. But the shows have been really fun!”
Last year at this time, the band was wrapping up some SXSW performances in celebration of their new full-length album The Valley. Although “celebration” may sound like a strange word to use in description of the album itself, it certainly describes the feeling of landing on the other side of such unfortunate circumstances. The Valley, one of last year’s hidden gems, paints a portrait of pain and confusion in the aftermath of divorce, a subject very personal to Sherri. The album’s content and feel stand in stark contrast to the band’s previous, more surreal, dream-like works, but this story required a much more blatant and forthcoming approach. In the end, releasing and performing The Valley served to be much more therapeutic than painful for the band, Sherri in particular.
“I think we’re pretty open, at least I am. I mean, my songs are always just ‘blech,’” Sherri’s hand motions and face depict a cathartic purging of ideas and emotion. “But that’s just me, that’s what you’re getting. I think the more personal a song is, the more people relate to it, so I think that’s something to shoot for. You have to be vulnerable, you know? That way people can connect with it.”
Having been recorded a few years prior to its release, The Valley and the events surrounding it had sufficient time to settle, giving everyone in the band the ability to process that time period and move forward. As the girls reflect on the album, they almost seem surprised at how far they’ve come since that difficult stage. “I feel like we’ve gone through so many changes as people since we recorded that record,” says Stacy. “I have no clue what’s going to come next because I just can’t imagine writing those songs now. I mean, even the style of them. I’m proud of it, but it was something very different for us, for sure.”
In addition to their personal trials during this time, the band also found itself stranded on a label (Warner Bros.) that refused to release the album that it had poured its heart and soul into creating. After two years of being in limbo, playing limited shows, and unable to release new material, Eisley and Warner Bros. parted ways at the beginning of 2010. Unfortunately, with their newfound freedom came an abundance of hard work to make up for time lost.
“It was nice to have a little bit of a break,” says Chauntelle. “But it also felt like it did us some damage in a way because people started to forget about us because we hadn’t been out in so long. We weren’t getting to do anything or move forward really.”
In the end, Sherri concludes that their time on a major label, albeit frustrating, also taught the band some valuable lessons and gave them a better understanding of what Eisley is all about. “You really don’t have a lot of control on those labels,” says Sherri. “That was probably why they didn’t like us, because we are very much the kind of group that fought for staying true to ourselves stylistically. We would turn down these big tours with pop stars that they wanted us to do and working with big producers. They wanted to turn us into something that would have made them, and probably us, money. But that wasn’t what we wanted.”
In seemingly no time at all, Eisley found the home it was looking for on Equal Vision Records—oddly enough the same label that hosts Sherri’s husband Max Bemis’ band Say Anything. Equal Vision not only promptly released The Valley, giving it the push it deserved, but also allowed the band to set up shop in Sherri and Max’s house in Tyler, TX, to record their new EP privately in the comfort of their own home. No longer feeling the pressure of major label executives breathing down their necks, the band was able to unwind in peace and rediscover their creative spark.
“We were pretty surprised that the label was cool with it,” says Sherri. “But they’re just awesome. They trust us and they trust our artistic vision, which is all we’ve ever wanted from a label.”
“It’s like you don’t even notice they’re there, really,” adds Stacy. “They’re just there to support you. They’re more like friends.”
The result of the band’s time spent in Tyler is this year’s Deep Space EP, a decidedly more relaxed and free-spirited outing than its predecessor. Released on Valentine’s Day, the EP touches on much happier matters while recapturing some of the mystery and ambiguity of the band’s earlier work. While only five tracks long, the album is packed with variety, featuring energetic, crunchy guitars on “Lights Out”, an acoustic throwback number in the form of “192 Days”, and some fun tempo changes thrown in for good measure on “One Last Song”.
“Something I was encouraged by when we put out the Deep Space EP is the reaction of a lot of our fans,” says Sherri. “They felt it sounded more like Eisley. More like Eisley than even The Valley sounded like Eisely.”
While there’s no denying that Deep Space certainly possesses some of the charm that made earlier releases such as Room Noises so memorable, the band says that most of those similarities are unintentional and are just products of their writing habits. “We’re songwriters at the core,” says Chauntelle. “So I think we just try to record the song in the best light. We think more like songwriters than producers. But there’s never like a conscious ‘okay, we’ve really got to make it sound like us,’ it just sort of happens on its own.”
“In the same sense,” adds Sherri, “we also don’t try to force anything to sound different, like ‘we’ve gotta make this record like this now because we’ve already done that kind of record.’ We don’t really think like that, it’s always just been whatever song comes out of you—whatever mood you’re in.”
Whether they’re all hanging out at home writing music or hitting the road again for another tour across the country, even bringing along their youngest siblings Christy and Collin as the opening act (Merriment), it’s clear that family is of the upmost importance to Eisley. Even as individual members of the band have begun their own families, the growth has only served to bolster their bond. Everyone in the band is in agreement that they’re all closer now than ever before, which has allowed for more freedom and creativity. In fact, Stacy is currently putting the finishing touches on a side project with her husband called Sucré, that’s due for release this spring.
“Getting to make a record with my husband has been the coolest thing ever,” shares Stacy. “It’s been a dream of mine from the time I met him. I’ve made it really slowly, so it was kind of just in the cracks, and I like that about it. It’s just making music that we love whenever we can.”
Later on in the evening as Eisley’s set winds to a close, Sherri will take the opportunity to speak up for her sister, pointing out Stacy’s modesty before telling the crowd about Sucré‘s upcoming release. She excitedly reveals that she has already preordered a vinyl copy for herself and gushes over the new record. If sibling rivalry exists in the DuPree family, it’s hidden exceptionally well. Music has appeared to create a bond within the family that transcends the need for spotlight or attention. According to Sherri, the more ventures begun outside of Eisley, the better.
“It’s cool,” she says, “because with all of the extra projects that we have, there’s never any down time where you’re not working in music. It’s so fun that way, you know? It’s just all music, all the time.”
Sherri’s not kidding. As soon as the band finish up their dates this summer in support of Deep Space, the band is heading back home to Tyler to begin recording their next full length record, which they hope to release early next year on Equal Vision. What’s clear is that this drive to create and share their art has little to do with success and recognition and everything to do with passion and love for family, fans, and music. Perhaps now more than ever, the band is able to take joy in the very act of doing what they love most.
“We just want to sustain ourselves and make records that we really like,” says Stacy. “We’re not focused too much on the career aspect of it as much as just being family and making music.”
“I think now everyone is just more comfortable with where they are,” adds Sherri. “We enjoy what we do. We’re at the point where we enjoy being in Eisley. We just get to make records and hopefully our fans love them, and that’s enough.”
As unfortunate as many of the circumstances were that led Eisley to where they are now, both personally and as a band, it’s evident that their trials have only strengthened their bond with one another and made clear their purpose as musicians. While The Valley stands as a beautiful, yet tragic marker, signifying where the band has come from, it does little to define where they are headed. Perhaps it was a painful necessity, opening the floodgates for something even more beautiful to flow. “There was so much fear involved with that record,” concludes Chauntelle. “Nowadays it’s different. We’reSome stray thoughts about this morning’s Oscar nominations from someone who reads more movie reviews than sees actual movies:
• If you compile a list titled “Oscar Winners and Losers,” “Dreamgirls” probably belongs under both headings. Yes, it led all films with eight nominations, but three were in one category (original song); three more in the so-called “technical categories” (art direction, sound mixing, costumes). No best picture or director nods, which was a surprise.
• You’d think with three of the five original-song nominees, “Dreamgirls” shouldn’t come home emptyhanded when the statuettes are handed out Feb. 25. But not so fast! The other two nominees are Mr. Oscar himself, Randy Newman, who composed “Our Town” from “Cars”; and Melissa Etheridge, whose “I Need to Wake Up” graced “An Inconvenient Truth.”
• Speaking of “Truth,” the awards ceremony could provide a surreal red-carpet scene. “Here come the stars! Look at those fabulous gowns. Wait! Isn’t that … Al Gore?” Yes, wire reports Tuesday indicated “Inconvenient Truth” star Gore will make the scene Feb. 25. Top that, Hillary and Barack.
• Some movies you wouldn’t expect to see in the same sentence as “Oscar nominee”:
“Click”: Makeup
“Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man’s Chest”: Actually did well for a lousy movie, with nominations for sound editing, visual effects, sound mixing and art direction.
“Poseidon”: visual effects
“The Black Dahlia”: cinematography
“Superman Returns”: visual effects
“Marie Antoinette”: costumes (go figure)
• Someone explain this to me. “Venus,” starring Peter O’Toole in what he called in an NPR interview a tale of “a dirty old man and a young slut,” had been scheduled to open Friday. Then he gets a best-actor Oscar nomination Tuesday, which sets off all the great story lines about how he’s 0-for-7 on Oscar night (he didn’t even win for “Lawrence of Arabia”) and how he almost turned down an honorary Oscar three years ago because he wanted to win a real one. Then we get word this afternoon that the opening has been delayed to Feb. 2.
• At least “Notes on a Scandal,” featuring nominees Judi Dench and Cate Blanchett, is still set to open Friday. So, “Venus” or no “Venus,” it’s still a great time to be a movie buff in San Antonio, with last week’s openings of “Pan’s Labyrinth” (six nominations), “The Last King of Scotland” (Forest Whitaker is the heavy favorite to win the best-actor Oscar), “Letters From Iwo Jima” (four nominations, including picture and director) and “Volver” (a nomination for Penelope Cruz). Plus the expanded runs for “The Queen” and “Babel.” And “The Departed” is set for an encore run Friday.Football Talk: Black Cats chase Celtic star, Di Maria's crossbar challenge

It was a fun book. On the surface it is about Moist von Lipwig, counterfeiter extraordinaire. He’s finally been caught, is scheduled for hanging. The trapdoor drops, the world goes black, and Moist wakes up in a chair in Lord Vetinari’s office. Lord Vetinari, “tyrant” ruler of the city of Ankh-Morpork, offers Moist a choice. He can walk through the door behind him into a deep, dark pit that will mean his death, or he can become the new Postmaster. Moist chooses Postmaster.
The Ankh-Morpork post office has been closed for a very long time and is stuffed to the gills with undelivered letters. Everyone uses the newest technology, the clacks, to send messages from town to town. The clacks are a series of huge towers strung across the landscape. The system of communication is by semaphore. The towers have a series of shutters on them and the operator sits inside typing in messages from the other towers along the line. The typed in message then goes up to the towers shutters where the semaphore message is relayed the opening and closing of the clacking shutters. This method of communication can get a message 2,000 miles in a matter of an hour or two. The only problem is, the clacks towers are under new management and they keep breaking down.
Moist sees his chance to make his mark and make some money. He challenges the clacks. In doing so he finds himself battling a master of deception, Reacher Gilt. But Moist knows how to play the game and keeps upping the ante. He refuses to fold and forces Reacher Gilt to call his bluff.
That’s the story on the surface. The book is also about fast versus slow, technology versus the human touch, corporations versus small business, greed, ambition, and putting on a good show. Pratchett takes enjoyment at poking fun at corporate-speak: with.”
This is an example of one of the things I like so much about Pratchett. He writes fantasy that makes fun of real world attitudes and events. Instead of writing in your face exposes, he writes a story that obviously isn’t true but is obviously filled with quite a bit of truth and wry observation. He’s a sort of cleaned up and pressed modern day Jonathan Swift.
If you are hesitant about reading fantasy, you may find Pratchett quite palatable. Most of his books take place in Discworld but you can read them in any order without feeling like you have missed out on anything. One warning, Pratchett is British and so is his humor. If you and British humor do not get along, then you should look elsewhere for a good read. On the other hand, if you find Monty Python and Douglas Adams to be primo entertainment, you will get along just fine.This book was written in very dire times. Cruelty, cynicism and demoralization fill the world with hatred... Disasters, catastrophes, man made uncontrolled events happen every day and global hegemony and greed are bringing the world closer to a scary and unprecedented war. This book is important today, so that people will learn about this spiritual person, Alex Orbito, who works to rescue us and our world, giving his life to God. He gives us his spiritual strength in his ongoing mission against this global madness. Reverend Alex Orbito is the world's most famous healer. Over a million people have been touched by his hands! Esteemed healer of many presidents and royal families around the world, he became a legend in his lifetime. He is the only healer recognized by the UN and by many medical scientists worldwide. He does not belong to himself and his life is entirely given to others in the service to God. Alex is a pyramid of spirituality, the four sides of which are: Healer, Guru, Spirit and Human.

i've enjoyed the luncheon buffet several times at 'ashoka the great' on pioneer. it's a good way to sample the fine curries and salads of southern cuisine. and, you are brought freshly heated flatbread (roti? i can't remember the name), which is excellent. also, there's high quality fresh fruit to cleanse and cool the palate afterward, so that's kind of nice. it's 6.95 per person, i believe, a bargain. or you can order on your own, off of their formidable menu.
the atmosphere is nice, a bit formal, with linens and fairly attentive staff, in keeping with their more profitable dinner crowd, but the lunchtime masses are a mixture of indians and locals, which i think is very good, and usually all are quite happy to be there. as was i.

The hunt is on for creative midfielders this summer as managers across England look for the perfect solution to unlocking packed defences. With Paul Scholes retiring, Frank Lampard ageing and Carlos Tevez agitating for a move, Manchester United, Chelsea and Manchester City are all looking for a player to shoulder attacking responsibility on the pitch and ‘deliver magic’.
On the other hand, you have Samir Nasri at Arsenal who is in the final year of his contract and has made a quite public stance of ‘wait and see’ this summer, courting United and City while keeping an eye on Arsenal’s transfer policies and of course, whether Fabregas finally leaves Arsenal or not. There were reports at the start of the summer that if Fabregas went Nasri would stay (i.e. Arsenal could afford to break the bank to keep him), but it’s more likely that his future will be independent of Cesc’s.
Then there is Luka Modric at Tottenham, the picture of politeness, who spoke through his agent about wanting to play in the Champions League right after it was clear that Tottenham would NOT qualify for the Champions League next season. He’s also spoken about wanting to play for Chelsea, and despite Ferguson’s interest the option of staying in London and getting a massive pay hike seems to appeal to the Tottenham midfielder. However, Spurs (justifiably) hold all the aces, and may increase his wages but not sell him this summer.
And finally you have Wesley Sneijder at Inter Milan – an ageing Inter Milan that is not only being dragged back into Calciopoli but also desperate to recover their footing after ruling Italy (and at one point Europe and the World) for a few years. Reports from Netherlands strongly suggest that Sneijder has his heart set at a move to United and the only stumbling block remains the transfer fee. Inter want 35m, and if United were to buy Sneijder it would probably be a player + cash deal. Which player? Well, Samuel Eto’o wants to play in the Premier League as well, so maybe there’s a striker going the other way?
It’s still the first week of July, so there’s plenty more to go in the transfer stories for these three players. What I’d like to do is to compare the stats for Modric, Nasri and Sneijder and look at who is, statistically speaking, the most valuable of them all.
Modric v Nasri v Sneijder – 2010/2011 League Stats
NASRI AND SNEIJDER LEAD THE WAY IN ATTACK
Stats show that while Luka Modric excels in his role as a deep-laying playmaker and actually wins more one-on-one duels than his more attacking peers, Samir Nasri and Wesley Sneijder dominated their respective leagues last season when it came to delivering balls in the final third.
Luka Modric also managed to make it into the top five in the Premier League rankings, completing 528 passes in the last third of the pitch.
Most successful passes in the final third – 2010/11 Premier League
Most successful passes in the final third – 2010/11 Serie A
For a team like City and United, both of whom need more creativity higher up the pitch, Nasri and Sneijder look to be the ideal recruits. On the other hand, United may look at their squad and think that Modric’s arrival would still leave them needing a more attacking midfielder (unless they press Modric higher up the pitch), while Chelsea would look at Modric as the ideal foil for Lampard in the center of the pitch and would be happy to have him sit back and run the show while Torres, Drogba, Malouda and co ran amok up front.
If you were managing United, City or Chelsea, which player would you buy and why?
07/07/2011 @ 15:58
ManU – Modric suits best for their style of play. nasri and sneijder are naturally more attacking midfielders but manu perhaps need someone who can control the game from the center as paul scholes used to do…
Chelsea – They have michael essien and ramires the midfield who are great CDMs n very effective…and then they have lampard for attacking…however lampard is not getin any younger and even had a bad season last time around…Sneijder is perhaps the best option for them
City – lets leave city, they may think of even buying all 3 of them at once :S….however i think to compete strongly in the champions league they need some1 of highest quality in the center midfield…barry and de jong are not up to the mark..having so many attackers i think Modric again is the perfect man for them…
07/07/2011 @ 16:36
Sneijder Ideal for Man Utd if they buy him kiss goodbye to the 2011-12 title!
city are yet to bring a team together and if they buy to many players each season may never happen money does buy a good squad but not maybe a good team and the type of players they are buying and putting on big wages (some big names wanting to leave) Tevez! looks like they could have a lot of problem childs just wanting the money don’t see players wanting to leave a trophy winning side even though they are on less wages! Money can de-motivate Players or attract the wrong ones!
07/07/2011 @ 20:30
How can you say de Jong is not up to it? He was by far the best defensive midfielder in the premier league last season. Better than essien, ramires, huddleston, sandro, carrick, fletcher, song, diaby or anyone else.
07/07/2011 @ 16:13
I prefer Sneijder for Man Utd, he’s more experienced, versatile & energetic.My problem with him is his signing fee & wage demand.We need to cut cost before UEFA’s sanction in a few years.
07/07/2011 @ 16:34
Modric has been on SAF’s radar for a while now but personally I would like to see Nasri and Sneider on board, both have much better champions league experience and are more dangerous in the final third. Both of them tend to stay injury free. I’ve always thought Modric, as good a player as he is, a little lightweight when it comes to the more physical games and he certainly doesn’t score as many goals as someone with his talent should be netting. Interesting times ahead…
07/07/2011 @ 16:40
De Jong not upto scratch? No doubt one of the most underated players on citys team, he covers every blade of grass on the pitch. Barry I’ll agree with, needs to go. De jong,Toure with sneijder playign above them and providing for Silva, Mario, AJ down the wings would be amazing.
07/07/2011 @ 16:40
Wesley Sneijder would be the best transfer out of the three as he has a massive amount of experience and talent.
07/07/2011 @ 16:43
I say
Modric: Chelsea
Man U: Sneijder
Man C: Nasri
I think those are the 1st choices of the clubs involved but it all depends on who signs first.
07/07/2011 @ 16:44
Good stats. Kudos that man
07/07/2011 @ 16:45
Nasri would be the ideal signing for united, he could operate in the centre of midfield with fletcher just behind, Rooney infront of him, young and Valencia on the wings and Hernandez up front.
Sneijder is too expensive and old judging by what ferguson has so far spent his money on and Modric won’t be allowed to leave unless it is for a massive amount
07/07/2011 @ 16:50
Just another hack. I guess IMScouting didn’t steal your money like they did mine. So at least you have numbers.
But Modric is not leaving. So STFU!
07/07/2011 @ 17:02
It would have been interesting to compare the stats of Sneijder and Pastore. I think many people know what Sneijder will deliver however my guess is that not quite as many know what Pastore does on the pitch.
07/07/2011 @ 17:18
senijder 4 man u.modric 4 chelsea.nasri 4 man u also.man city dnt need those players.they hv good mildfiled who can deliver
07/07/2011 @ 17:21
Man utd:
I would prefer all 3 to sign for united. If ferguson is looking to get e champions league title then he needs to invest in central midfielder.
Having carrick in defensive role, adding modric to support the central midfielder to distibute passes to young n nani and sneijder helping rooney in attacking would be e best formation to dokinate epl n even champions league.
07/07/2011 @ 18:27
Carrick in a defensive role? Have you seen his defensive capabilities? For reference watch either of the cl finals against barca and you will see he is not a quality defensive mid. Fletcher would be better in that position or maybe even jones could fit into that role.
07/07/2011 @ 18:16
sneijder for sure for united, second modric, third nasri because there questions about him i.e. he was showing his form just first half of the season inconsistent for such level player + his attitude is questionable
07/07/2011 @ 18:32
Just go for it and try and get nasri and fab from the gunners that would really upset them
07/07/2011 @ 18:33
Modric – Stays at tottenham
Sneijder and Nasri – Move to man u.
07/07/2011 @ 19:04
I’d like nasri playing behind rooney and chicharito. Thats a perfect combination to win the champions league next season.
levi.lusaka99@gmail. com.
07/07/2011 @ 19:16
man utd – samir nasri would be perfect for the midfield he has a great ability to keep the ball and he is 24 years old which means he has little left to becoming a complete player. and his experience would be ideal for the club. he would cost £25m plus maximum £120,000 per week which utd can definitely afford with the departures of oshea, gibson, brown and maybe berbatov(total around £20m).
sneijder is a brilliant player but he hasnt been at his best last season and the epl is a far tougher league than serie a so there is a huge risk for utd with at least £35m plus £200,000 per week which i think is a very stupid gamble. i think city should snap him up they have limitless funds and someone that can lead the team of superstars together. a tevez and sneijder swap deal with maybe £10m extra from city would be perfect for both clubs and players as eto’o is signalling a move.
modric should if he was clever go to chelsea purely on the basis that chelsea midfield isnt young and energetic as it use to be with lampard, malouda essien(out of form). but the problem is that modric has no value, £50m for a player who couldnt be influential against top clubs is an issue but with players like ramires, torres, luiz and likely arrivals of falcao, moutinho would make him a great player.
so
Nasri to man utd £25m
sneijder to man city £10m to £15m plus tevez
modric to chelsea £30m plus drogba
07/07/2011 @ 21:51
Although I would love to see all 3 sign for utd, i think it would be unfair to some of of the talented english talent being wasted ie Tom Cleverley. I think they should sign Sneijder definitely, as his experience could help the younger midfielders, and he would be a great asset for the rest of his career there. I would still like to see them sign Nasri as well, as a long term signing, and to produce one of the best central midfield partnerships around (Sneijder and Nasri). As good a player Modric is, I think he would only be a good signing providing they fail with one of the other two.
07/07/2011 @ 23:49
Ram it the lot of you. Modric is going nowhere. Who ‘should we sign’? Who do you think you are?
08/07/2011 @ 00:24
In the Champions League as opposed to the Europa League?
09/07/2011 @ 02:41
Whenever i saw City’s team sheet, i always looked for De Jongs name first, he was a world cup finalist and city had the best defence in the league last year, partly down to our best player, him and Company stopped everything.
With Silva,Yaya and Nasri passing the ball around to dzeko and Aguerro, and a top class center half, watch us go.
09/07/2011 @ 08:21
I think a sack letter will be fit for arsene wenger,the guy is a rotten guy.
10/07/2011 @ 01:04
I think that Sneijder should come to Man Utd .. Since Paul is gone he shout take the responsibility plus we need a guy u could pass and shoot with amazing accuracy hence why sneijder should come to old trafford.Chelsea needs someone like Modric.Frank Lampard isnt getting any younger soo Modric would fit perfectly there :). If Tevez leaves,it doesnt matter.City has BRILLIANT players don’t really think they need another attackin midfielder.
10/07/2011 @ 08:41
Sneijder to Chelsea….
11/07/2011 @ 09:17
Sneijder is a mor beta player amogst d 3players anytime anyday n he n nasri wil do vry wel at unitd wt der style of play,modrik sud go 2 chelsea y city sud try n capture btw sneijder n nasri bt i tink unitd stil remains d best positn 4 any of d players. Emecheta chux 4rm lagos, Nigeria.

I am confused on nasri n sneijder for manu cauz nasri is young,energetic n has time 2 b best wid sir alex bt sneijder is jst lyk scholes n bit aged n experienced wid a c l final win n barca beating capacity….i guess it should b sneijder n del rossi for manu
12/07/2011 @ 11:37
Man U and Man City should stop dreaming of signing Samir Nasir,they should try to make their own stars.Sneijder should stay with Inter and finish up the incomplete job he started.
12/07/2011 @ 18:52
As a United fan I would be delighted with either Modric or Sneijder. Great article.
Your readers may be interested in my website on the greatest players and teams of all time:

30/07/2011 @ 10:19
SEE, the real stuff is that Manchester United are best in defence, but the real thing they require is their creativity upfront. Samir Nasri is an ideal person to perform this.
On the other hand Chelsea require a replacement for Lampard. Modric comes in to fill the gap. HE’ll learn a lot there and become one of the greatest in midfield in epl.
Finally, Man City dont require Sniejder & Luka since they have high quality midfielders like Silva. If Tevez leaves, sign Nasri Otherwise improve the defence

all three for man cityDid you know that May is Foster Parent Appreciation Month?
So this month I thought I would share some stories that I have experienced as a foster mom.
Young foster children and infants are automatically eligible for the WIC program. I really wasn’t planning on taking them up on it with Little Lady, but then the doctor prescribed Nutrimagen. Have you seen the price of that stuff?!
So I am at the grocery store redeeming WIC vouchers for formula. I have all 4 kids with me (Cole, Charley, newborn Little Lady, and her brother Little Man). The cashier knows me well and she knows that we foster. She smiles as she sees Little Lady and comments about how beautiful she is.
As I am checking out (with the super annoying fact that I had to use 4 separate transactions) the woman behind me is on her phone. She loudly tells the person she is talking to that she can’t stand “breeders” that mooch off of the government to support their kids.
Yeah, we are probably thinking the same thing, but my thoughts probably has a few more choice words than yours.
The cashier gets mad. She takes a deep breath and I can tell she is about to set the woman straight. I quickly put my hand up and then bring my forefinger to my mouth. I signal to her to shush (nicely, of course – she isn’t one of my kids after all). She looks at me with a confused face. I whisper to her as the woman is still ranting on the phone, “She doesn’t need to know anything. Nothing we say is going to change her heart. We might make her feel like crap for a minute or two, but her heart needs to be softened by God.”
As I am talking, I can’t believe the words coming out of my mouth. Am I saying this? Surely I can’t be saying this! The only softening I want this lady to get is from my fist.
God stepped in, just like He has so many times for me. Nothing I said or did in that moment on my own was going to be good. While that woman may never know anything about me, foster care, or helping out the people that need a hand through services like WIC, she was a big part of something.
That cashier told me later that she loved what I said that day. She told some friends about it. It led to conversations with two different friends about God. One of her friends she talked with starting asking questions, started going to church, and is now finding things out for herself. I love it!
I learned that God leading my path to foster care wasn’t solely about our family or the kids we connect with. He uses so many things in so many ways.
And to think that I wanted to tell that woman off. Who am I kidding? I still want to tell her off!
Holy cow, that was amazing! What a great story. I would have wanted to tell that lady a thing or two as well, but I'm glad God moved you to be kind to her. It's so cool that in hind site, you probably thought it was for the benefit of the rude woman, but in actuality, God knew the cashier needed that to happen so she could share with her friends. He's awesome! His ways are certainly not our ways :)
What a great story! Good for you. I admire what you do and find your experiences so inspiring. I wish I had the ability to foster. Kim, you have such a wonderful heart, God really is using you to be a light!
Wow, that is amazing that you said that. I would have been so tempted to set her straight.
I so would have gone with your first thought. I need to send this on to a friend who did foster to adopt
Oh wow. I am in awe that you didnt tackle the woman and cram her cell down her throat. =)
I am so proud of you for how you acted and your beautiful attitude.
Crazy!!!!!
Beautiful story! I love how God is using you. I took a bloggy break for Lent and just now getting back. Glad to catch up with you.
yay, i love that!!! it's amazing what comes out of our mouths when we let God do the talking!
While we were fostering my 2nd daughter (blog name Pumpkin), this VERY thing happened to me in the grocery store. A lot.
After all, I pulled up in my minivan, well-dressed, and bought a lot of groceries with my own money. But when that separate WIC transaction came up, inevitably I got an eyebrow or a snarky comment.
The rage that bubbled up was hard to quash. After all, here I was fighting to KEEP this baby and all the person behind me was thinking about was how I was mooching off the gov't dime.
You are a much, much better woman than I, my friend!
Wow... This story is so beautiful! I've written many status comments on this... People lack compassion in this world. I hope one day after I have my Baby to give back like you are... It's inspiring me with going on with Nursing. People judge before getting to know your situation. You may see a mother as in your situation with 4 kids and judge them not knowing that they are saving Children from a very sad situation. You may see a young single mother but you dont know her situation. Or a married mother who's family is struggling to make ends meet in this economy. Any woman that steps up to the plate deserves praise not criticism and believe me... One day that lady will have her eyes opened up. God has a funny way of doing it. Believe me ;)This post has been imported from our personal blog.

There were countless others, Black and White, who just let those tears flow. A white boy from Cleveland, Ohio, left his office desk in Mumbai, to go to the washroom to wipe his tears. A woman in Illinois, said in between tears, that the President-elect belonged to her state, and the state of Abraham Lincoln, who signed the law freeing African Americans from slavery in 1863.
It was a moment where -- to borrow a term from a CNN commentator -- America was correcting itself. It finally had elected an African American President and fulfilled the dream of that great visionary-poet from Atlanta.

Published in the Journal & Courier from Dec. 11 to Dec. 12, 2012kiddos, i ve got a few mails regarding where to find the clear nails.
you can easily find them on ebay, just search for 'clear tips', you will find loads of offers.
i conveniently bought the glue in the same ebay shop but i think every nail glue will do the trick.
i never tried fake nails before but it was really easy to stick them on, so just try it dolls!
cut them to any length as they are awesome short and long.
sometimes i also get asked about shopping in vienna, but i have to admit that i buy 99% of my stuff online. i would suggest the area around the 'neubaugasse' for highstreet brands and other little shops though.
if you want to know something more specific just go and leave a comment and i will answer right there.

According to the survey, only 10.74 percent of households were investors (up from 7.4 percent in 2001-2002) while 89 percent were either saving in fixed income or are still clinging to their savings accounts. About 46 percent of urban households preferred to save, compared to 21 percent who chose investing.
In 2002, this was not a bad idea. India’s GDP grew at 3.7 percent that year compared with 2001. But in 2003, it jumped to 8.37 percent because of services (mostly financial, real estate and business services) and manufacturing sector which together drove this transition to a higher growth trajectory.
In the same year, the amount of foreign money entering India’s capital markets rose sevenfold. Most of this came from foreign institutional investors, who poured in 304.6 billion rupees ($5.5 billion), compared to 36 billion rupees ($665 million) a year earlier. They bought the Indian growth story; why didn’t we?
The Bombay Stock Exchange’s benchmark 30-share Sensex index started an unprecedented rise on May 6, 2003, climbing almost 67 percent to 5003 points seven months later. That was a better performance than nearly any other investment option out there. What did the Indian individual investor do?
You wouldn’t know because the Securities and Exchange Board of India’s handbook of statistics has no information. And as per the NCAER survey, about 43 percent of investors prefer to invest through mutual funds rather than jumping into the open field all by themselves.
Over the years, mutual funds’ assets under management in equity funds have grown immensely. It stands at $33 billion (assets in equity funds) as compared to measly $5.32 billion in March 2004.
The growth appears impressive. However, only 11 percent of the population is part of this smaller investor community. “Average” Indian investors might want to rethink their historical avoidance of stocks. Inflation (CPI) is 10.16 percent (May 2012) and rising, above the nine-year average of 6.98 percent.
In such a situation, saving will keep them safe … but will it keep themians are wise Saver as well wise Investor, they were not lured by fraud companies depicting wrong picture in their balance sheet. And they understand the vicious nexus between Promoter, Fund Manager and Operator(Manipulator). So we should keep away from Equity and keep safe our Saving. Equity is the worst vehicle for investment. Its safe to keep our Investment in Fixed Instrument only
I have not found ADRs of Indian manufacturers listed on American exchanges very plentiful and the ones that are where not good deals. Quarterly reports are missing. One firm was found to be book cooking. In sort reliable data on firms treating share holders well was missing.
Since reports where India was growing economy I was looking into suitable ADRs but was not welcome.
I dont agree with the conclusion. Here’s why: Over 20 years Fixed Deposits have beaten the Sensex. In this calc, FDs were renewed every year while Sensex was buy-and-hold. If Long term FDs were used then the returns would have been higher. Its always easy to take any period of time to prove the case. If you take 2009 -2012, Equities were the worst off despite heavy FII inflows in 2010.
Also, “Investment” does not take into the account the vast Gold Reserves which Indian Households have which beat any fiat currency denominated investments.wiradikusuma

On setting goals
Writing is a Good Thing™—somebody even compiled 17 reasons for doing it—but it's hard, especially for perfectionists (and procrastinators!) like me—I can write a paragraph and keep refining it for an hour. But why is my old self seems to be more productive? I think the reason is, like I said, I feel bad when I fail to meet my target. The disappointment adds up, and it's making me to think, "The hell with this, I'm not gonna make it."!
Note that it's better to set the categories in stages. That is, achieving awesomeness means completing the rest. I could set the awesomeness to be "Write a book", but accomplishing it doesn't mean I meet my target (52 posts), which will make me sad.
Now it's your turn.

Pengalaman tinggal di Kuala Lumpur,
Tempat tinggal pertama: Shah Alam..
Pengalaman dari tinggal di Shah Alam:
- Beberapa perusahaan besar di Malaysia mempunyai call center outsource dan mendapat akomodasi tempat tinggal (satu kondo bertiga) dan bis karyawan. Karena mereka bekerja shift, bisnya datang setiap jam.
-.
- Transportasi massal berbasis rel di Kuala Lumpur ada tiga: monorail, KTM dan LRT. KTM hampir sama dengan KRL AC ekonomi(?) di Jakarta—sama-sama ga tepat waktu dan lambat.
- Tiket dapat dibeli di konter atau mesin (tapi kebanyakan mesinnya rusak, hehe), atau pakai kartu Touch N Go (kartu debit).
-.
- Disini ga ada ojek, bajaj, omprengan atau angkot (minibus). Selain transportasi berbasis rel, hanya ada bis dan taksi.
-.
- Kalau naik bis, kamu umumnya harus berhenti di halte, ga boleh di sembarang tempat.
- Taksi disini sangat pemilih. Sedikit macet ga mau, padahal kan tetap dibayar!
- Di beberapa tempat (terutama daerah turis dan tempat clubbing), taksi ga mau pakai argo ("meter") atau minta tambahan, misalnya +RM2 (~Rp6 ribu).
-.
- Taksi disini jauh lebih jelek dibandingkan di Jakarta.
- Naik taksi disini cenderung lebih murah, mungkin karena tidak begitu macet dan tidak perlu memberi tip.
- Jalan raya di Malaysia lebih lebar.
- Jalanan disini umumnya hanya macet sebelum dan sesudah jam kerja, tapi macetnya tetap lebih "masuk akal" dibandingkan dengan di Jakarta.
- Beberapa jalan tol dipasangi speed trap—kamera yang menangkap kalau kamu terlalu ngebut.
-.
- Di Kuala Lumpur, mobil lebih banyak dari motor.
- Motor boleh masuk tol tanpa membayar.
- Kadang disediakan jalur khusus untuk motor.
- Tidak ada yang mau naik motor kecuali terpaksa. Pedagang kaki lima dan penjual DVD bajakan di emperan jalan pun naik mobil.
-).
- Orang Malaysia sedikit lebih teratur dalam mengantri, termasuk di lampu merah (untuk hal ini, pengemudi mobil lebih patuh dibanding pejalan kaki).
- Disini ga ada tukang parkir, apalagi "pak ogah".
Status update, midyear 2012
How fast time flies. My last post was on the 1st of January this year, and that's more than a half year ago!
I was dormant here, but I kept on writing (at least for a couple of weeks) in #anakkos, a blog inside Neytap.com, a classifieds for room rentals, for SEO purpose. So far, the website receives almost 100 page views daily. Not bad for a $0 marketing effort.!
TL;DR: Neytap is designed to be speedy, with the (unforeseen) expense of search engine discoverability. Lucky that blogging helps, although not by much. This explains why engineers suck at selling consumer products :D
Next, I co-founded Cabara.co.id, a curated marketplace for domestic workers. At the moment we're focusing on maid service in Jakarta. We pitched in Startup Asia Jakarta 2012, you can watch my pitch there in YouTube (you might want to skip the first few minutes).
We didn't win (we'd be surprised if we did), but it's a great opportunity to pitch there. We were covered in Tech In Asia and some other publications, and approached by a number of VCs. Everything is new to me (and to my co-founders as well, apparently), so it was quite an experience.
Last but not least, I recently created temanmudik.com, a (social network?) website to connect Indonesians who are going homecoming this year. It's a tradition in Indonesia—and probably other Muslim countries, I know they have it in Malaysia—for people to go back to their hometown to celebrate Eid ul-Fitr (in Indonesia it's called Idul Fitri or Lebaran).

Would convertible debt burden me?
For the one I'm doing with a co-founder, it's pretty much stalled. It requires significant capital investment and some brick-and-mortar business networking thus we can't start from zero. My co-founder has pitched to some VCs all out, but apparently the conventional wisdom is true: you can't really get investors just by selling idea. At least not when you're nobody.
For the other one, a classifieds for room rentals (the idea is much bigger than that, but I must start from something small), it's been going slow. I thought of speeding it up; quit my full-time job and give the project all the love. That's why I was thinking of raising MYR 75k (USD ~23.7k or IDR ~210m) in convertible debt to fund the project for at least 6 months.
I cold emailed some people (only two, actually. A CEO in a company I worked for and an acquaintance I met in airport), asking whether they know anyone interested to angel invest in my project.
The latter forwarded my email to her business partner who then asked for a pitch. To my surprise, he showed deep interest on our first meeting, and immediately showed intent to invest after reading my financial projection (which I think quite conservative on number).
In case you're curious, here's my proposed term:
- 8% interest p/a
- 25% discount
- with cap
- maturity at 1 year
- Start the company in Malaysia so we can get government grants and stuff, but it must be majority owned by local, so he proposed...
- 60% for himself (being a Malaysian). And because his business partner (my friend) introduced us, so...
- She'll get 20%.
- Maybe he doesn't really trust me, so the money will be dispensed monthly, and...
- I must get his permission for any expenses.
My friend jokingly said the money I need is around the price a car, might as well I borrow it from bank and keep 100% share for myself.
I emailed the investor politely rejecting his offer. Here's a snippet of the letter:
You've been very gracious with your time and I'm thankful for that. After careful consideration, however, I have decided not to take your current offer. I have asked around and did some research, convertible debt is still the term I want.
There's a great article on the benefits of convertible debt,, where the two main points (for me) are Suitability (point 2) and Control (point 3). It is also investor-friendly when complemented with discount and cap.I guess I'll keep doing this as a side project until I can stand on my own or found more sensible investment.

Validating your idea.
But there's a lie within landing page approach: Sometimes the traction doesn't translate to actual product usage. It might be because the product is "less interesting" than what you promise in the landing page, or the product launched too late (the guy who subscribed already forget who you are and what you do), or any other reasons. Just be prepared with this. :)

How much should you pay developers?
Teddie followed up with an interesting question (copied as-is), "As a Founder..how much U willing to Pay Your Programmer (honestly)?" Wenas Agusetiawan replied, "rockstars deserve to be paid well," but Teddie didn't seem satisfied with the answer thus asked again, "how much?"
My answer is: "It depends." Let me elaborate.
I'm a programmer myself. If I were to outsource/delegate programming tasks for any of my startups, it must be because (1) I'm not good enough to do it myself, or (2) The tasks so boring I'd rather do something else, like sleeping.
So, how much?
If I were to pay the programmer for the first reason then I must award him well. He's smarter than me, he deserves at least same salary I'd get if I were to do it myself. If for the second reason, I'll base on industry standard, or, "How much I'm willing to be paid if I don't have better option." (Which is logical—if you're the programmer, would you take the boring/repetitive job if you have better option?)
Of course, being a startup founder, you must squeeze expenses as much as you can. So for the first case, I'll negotiate with him but focus on retainment (I don't want to lose him). For the second case, I'll focus on minimizing expenses (I don't want to lose too much money).
Note: Change "him" to "her" for your convenience.

The Census is in: The 2010 Census results were released yesterday. Virginia continued with double-digit growth, Maryland experienced nearly 10% growth, and DC topped 600,000 for the first time since the 1950s. Neither Virginia, nor Maryland will see any change in their Congressional delegation size. (WUSA)
Census results complicate DC vote fight: After the last Census, DC voting rights advocates partnered with Republican-heavy Utah, who was left just short of gaining another House seat, to fight for a seat for both. This year, Utah got their seat anyway thanks to continued growth and the next state in line, North Carolina, is itself a politically balanced state. (WAMU)
New federal money for K Street transitway: The Federal Transit Administration has awarded DC a $1 million planning and analysis grant to explore new streetcar technology and advance the K Street Transitway plan. (Examiner)
New UMD president gets the Purple Line: It looks like Wallace Loh's rule at the University of Maryland may be a breath of fresh air for Purple Line advocates, after years opposition under C. Dan Mote. Loh has talked with officials at Portland State University about the light rail on their campus. (Rethink College Park, Cavan)
Tax break and much more passes: The DC Council passed a 20-year, $46 million tax abatement for a planned hotel in Adams Morgan. That's one of many bills passed yesterday including ones on rent control, open meetings (though exempting Council committees), and rules limiting homeless shelters to DC residents. (TBD, Post)
BRAC parking cap cut from defense bill: Virginia
Senator Congressman Jim Moran's proposed cap of 1,000 parking spaces at the new BRAC headquarters in Alexandria was cut from the Defense Reauthorization Act, leaving the onus on the Pentagon to take steps to reduce driving to the new campus. Moran says he will reintroduce the cap in 2011. (Dr. Gridlock)

From that table, it looks like Rhode Island is getting the 435'th seat. So the solution would be to give RI and DC each one seat, instead of giving RI two and DC none. That would definitely be doable, since RI is a tiny state that is reliably democratic.
It also looks from that table that if the House were expanded, Montana would be in line to get the 436'th seat. So a second solution would be to give Montana a second seat and give one to DC. That should also be doable since Montana is reliably Republican.

Eleanor Holmes Norton failed horribly. She will be lucky if she keeps her vote in committee, and her chances of getting a vote on the floor are nil.
Anyone who thinks that a Congress that did NOT pass DC voting rights with a big Democratic majority will turn around and pass it next year with an even bigger Republican majority is simply delusional.
I don't know which is the bigger tragedy: the epic fail of Norton and Obama when the opportunity was there, or the coming GOP House majority slamming the door on that hopey-changey feeling that we were finally gonna get a vote.

Maybe you meant otherwise, but it sure sounds like you're saying that Congress should be taking away one of RI's seats so that there's a spare seat to give to DC. My point that last time around we were trying to give someone (i.e., the Republicans) something (an extra seat) in order to get them to agree to give DC a seat ... which otherwise would have posed a threat to them (the Republicans) because the DC seat would be sure to be Democratic ... and be used to vote against them. It was a carrot. Taking away a seat from RI isn't a carrot ... Maybe 'illegal' is too strong a term, but I think you get the gist of what I meant.

Statehood would be great. But the last time it was voted on, it was absolutely destroyed. I think a majority of Democrats voted against it. So you'll have to convince a lot of people that DC, with a population only 85% that of the average congressional district, deserves a rep and 2 Senators. Plus you need to amend the Constitution. I still think it's easier, more politically viable and better to amend the Constitution to allow non-States to have reps and share Senators.
Lance, if DC were given a seat, it would raise the effective population needed for a seat and reduce the number of 'extra' seats to be alloted. That would leave RI with one fewer seat, but it wouldn't really be taking it away from RI. It would be taking it away from the pot of extras and thus indirectly from RI.

Welcome to the real world. We do that all the time. Why do you think we have democratic organizations in place? You only gain and preserve rights ... even basic rights ... when you have something to trade. In the case of democracies, it's the ability to trade self-governance and law and order via our representatives in exchange for the right to enjoy our 'basic' rights. In countries where that isn't possible, you end up with military juntas (think Latin America) or other dictatorships (think Saddam Huessein's Iraq). First and foremost for society to function is law and order. So don't believe for one minute that democratic organizations exist solely to protect our basic rights. The exist because they can trade that law and order for those basic rights for us. And our getting a vote in Congress will require our being able to offer up something in return. Like everything in life, it needs to be earned/traded in some way.
by Lance on Dec 22, 2010 11:04 am • link • report
Disagree: it would not be "illegal" to take a seat away from a state at the bottom of the list and give it to DC. In fact, if you changed how the apportionment worked (to give one seat to DC or treat DC like a state for giving out congressional seats) then one state would by design get one fewer congressperson and DC would get that one.
Agree: If you want to keep pushing this, do it like we did last time. Propose bringing the house up to 437, give one of those seats to DC and one seat to whatever state is next on the apportionment list. It looks like North Carolina is next on the list so you would give them a seat and give DC a seat.
It's not going to happen this time. But I'm not sure we should have accepted a complete and total gutting of our gun laws in exchange for one damn congressional vote. I do think DC's gun laws were too strict but I don't think we should sacrifice our ability to have those laws at all.

But doesn't currently RI have 2 seats? Don't you think they would view it as one of their seats being taken away in order to give DC a seat? irrespective of the 'fine print' of how it was taken away?
Incidentally, I agree with you:
'I still think it's easier, more politically viable and better to amend the Constitution to allow non-States to have reps and share Senators.'
We're lacking basic representation, and there's no excuse for that. But our becoming a state could be counter to our own self interests ... and that of the nation. Because we're not a state, we get a lot or things that states don't get. (For example: museums with no entry fees; special funding for roads (we get something like 95% of all our road funds from the feds vs. something like a 50% match for Interstate roads for the states); a very stable workforce, etc.) Being the nation's capital we'll always have a unique relationship with the feds. A relationship that would have to change if we were a state. There's no reason we can't get a vote in Congress (house and senate) and STILL retain that special relationship with its rights and responsibilities that are different from the rights and responsibilities which states have vis-a-vis the federal government. AND, as you so aptly point out, it would probably be a lot easier to change the constituention to allow that than to change DC into a state.

You would not have to amend the Constitution to make DC a state. You would have to make the "federal district" smaller, say, a strip from the Washington Monument to the Capitol, for example.

Yes to the latter, but not really to the former. Here is the method by which the Census determines Congressional seat appropriation. True, giving a seat to DC would take away from "last place on the list" (North Carolina based on the 2000 numbers), but the extra population argument only really applies to whoever's in "last place".
A correction to an earlier comment of mine. I did the number crunching based on the apportionment formula, and based on my numbers, it's actually Texas that got seat #435 (Minnesota got seat #434). North Carolina is still next on the list, as I mentioned before.

What I was referring to earlier was the federal funding mechanism used for DC vs. states (any state). I remember reading an article (many years ago) where this was given as one of the examples of the many bene's we get. It went something like this: the usual formula for states receiving federal highway funds is that states need to match dollar for dollar any funding from the feds. Hence, if the feds are giving $100 M for road work, then the state has to also spend $100 M for road work. AND that this only applied to certain 'national' roads such as the interstate highways. BUT for DC, the formula was more along the lines that DC only had to match something like $5 for every $95 that the feds put in. AND that because all roads in the District technically belong to the feds, all the roads qualified for this funding ... unlike just the 'national' ones in the states. This was just one of many examples given in the article on how we really did get special treatment from the feds for being the capital. I'm sure it can also be a double-edged sword. It's like when our parents pay for things for us, it doesn't come without strings. It's a trade-off. Yeah, we could (possibly) lobby to get the District shrank down to a fraction in size of what it is now, but then we'd need to be prepared to lose all these benes. In any case, that can be a separate argument than just insisting on voting rights as a district. An amendment was passed allowing us to vote for President ... why can't an amendment equally easily be passed giving us voting representation in Congress. I don't see how anyone could oppose that. It's not like we'd be asking to stop being the national capital (which is essentially what asking to be a state does for all practical purposes.) Yes, short term the Dems might have to make some concession in order to gain those extra Democrat-leaning votes passed the Republicans. But I can't see how other than that there would be any opposition for us getting representation ... provided we were remaining a district.

Add a CommentWhen I first started to explore my paternal genealogy, three decades ago, I envisaged my research according to the following schema:
This village gave name to the Skevingtons, an ancient and noble family, who have continued owners thereof for several centuries; and they have produced many men of note and abilities, who have repeatedly by their lives adorned the historic page. Few families in the kingdom can boast of more ancient and honourable descent, or have more eminently distinguished themselves on all occasions.
For the moment, we have no idea of the identity of the Conqueror's companion who became the progenitor of the people to be known in England, later on, as Skeffington (or a spelling variant on that term). It's quite likely that this Norman patriarch actually left older brothers on the family estates in Normandy… and it's thinkable that descendants of these older brothers exist today, maybe even in Normandy. As a longtime Francophile, I've always imagined that it would be a fabulous thrill to meet up, today, with genetic cousins in modern France… and DNA testing means that this possibility is becoming plausible.
Back in 1981, when I started my genealogical research into Skyvington ancestors, it was a rather bare-bones affair. My grandfather had even assured me that no records concerning his ancestors could possibly exist on the surface of the planet, and that the last traces of his background had been wiped out by the Blitz! This, of course, was sheer nonsense… but I now realize that he may have been intent upon avoiding embarrassing questions concerning his father, mentioned in my article of 3 May 2010 entitled Family-history shock [display]. In any case, my research soon led me back over half-a-dozen generations, ending up with a George Skivington [1670-1711] of Dorset. Throughout this research, I've been constantly on the lookout for events that might enable my backward-pointing green arrow to meet up with the mainstream red arrow. In other words, I've been trying to determine the exact point at which my Skivington/Skyvington branch might have broken away from the mainstream Skeffington line.
Let me summarize rapidly some of the major mileposts on that red arrow… which are presented in detail in my Skeffington monograph, whose chapters can be downloaded from this website. The earliest-known members of the English family were referred to as John de Skefynton [1188], Simon de Scheftinton [1193] and Odo de Scevington [1231].
In the first quarter of the 16th century, during the reigns of the Tudor kings Henry VII and Henry VIII, two knights appeared on the British historical scene: Sir William Skeffington [1460-1535] and his young brother Sir John Skeffington [1470-1525]. Artillery skills had launched William's career, and his nickname was the Gunner. His son Thomas, too, was a soldier.
Today, the tip of the red arrow is John Skeffington, the 14th Viscount Massereene. Concerning this 70-year-old gentleman (who doesn't give me the impression that he's particularly interested in family history), an important point must be made. There would be no point whatsoever in looking for Y-chromosome matches between the viscount and Normans who might be our genetic cousins. Why not? Well, the Skeffington male genetic line was broken through the marriage of Harriet Skeffington with Thomas Foster in 1810. Since then, the male progeny is indeed called Skeffington, but their Y-chromosomes are those of Thomas Foster. On the other hand, illegitimate Skeffington offspring who existed before the time of that marriage could well convey the original Y-chromosomes of the Norman patriarchs. Regardless, I advise all Skeffington males concerned by genealogy to get their DNA tested!
Now, what has been happening concerning my green arrow, and the likelihood of its running into the red arrow? Well, the discovery of the above-mentioned George Skivington in Dorset means that the tip of my green arrow has moved backwards to such an extent that my Ski(y)vington family history could not have been linked to the Massereene lords or Irish Skeffingtons. That's to say, the Massereene dynasty and the Irish Skeffingtons are simply not a part of my personal family history. So, I don't intend to carry on researching in this arena.
The separation between the green and red arrows extends still further back in time. Recently, I've encountered references to rural families and individuals whose name is written as Skevington, who are anterior to the Tudor lords. In other words, the time slot in which my little green arrow might join up with the mainstream red arrow can only be somewhere during the four centuries between 1066 and the Tudor lords. In other words, much of what I have written in my Skeffington monograph turns out to be totally irrelevant as far as my personal family history is concerned. And it's in that sense that I say, jokingly, that I've painted myself into a genealogical corner!
To put it bluntly, I now have every right to wonder who in fact, in this whole affair, is legitimately "mainstream": the noble dynasty that emanated from the Tudor lords, or my humble line of Ski(y)vingtons? On their side, the advantages are significant, primarily in numbers (all those folk named Skeffington), historical celebrity (but let us not exaggerate) and the quality of archives. An advantage on our side, however, is the regularity of generations of modest rural folk, devoid of the crimes, notoriety, legacy quarrels and sheer madness that have often characterized the noble Skeffingtons. And above all, on the Ski(y)vington side, there is still the very real possibility of our direct Y-chromosome descent from the anonymous Norman patriarch who reached England with the Conqueror.

December 8, 2013
Chase Elliott crossed the finish line first, but was soon disqualified after a post-race inspection.
Chase Elliott won the pole, led the most laps and easily took the checkered flag… but didn’t get to keep the winner’s trophy at Sunday afternoon’s 46th annual Snowball Derby at 5 Flags Speedway in Pensacola, Fla. Instead, the trophy went to Erik Jones after Elliott’s winning car was disqualified in post-race tech inspection.
Jones inherited the victory in the 300-lap Super Late Model race when inspectors ruled that the ballast in Elliott’s car was of the proper weight, but wasn’t the proper material. (Rules clearly state it must be lead; the ballast in Elliott’s car was tungsten). It was Jones’s second consecutive Snowball victory, coming a year after his improbable victory over Kyle Busch earned him a job with Busch’s race team.
“A win is a win so we’ll take it,” Jones said after getting the victory despite not leading a single lap. “Sometimes it plays out like this. We all come knowing about the Room of Doom (tech inspection) and everyone has to pass through it. Getting back-to-back wins at the Derby is special to not only me but to Kyle Busch Motorsports and [sponsor] James Finch and everyone at Phoenix Construction. It’s extremely hard to do and puts a nice seal on the 2013 season.”
After starting 17th Jones worked his way to second with 14 laps remaining. The race went the rest of the way without a caution, and Jones finished well behind Elliott, who led 227 of the 300 laps. The victory capped a season during which Jones won a late-season Camping World Truck Series race at Phoenix, an ARCA race at Marne, Mich. and a the 400-lap Super Late Model race at Winchester, Ind.
Grant Enfinger finished second, then Austin Theirault, Hunter Robbins, John Hunter Nemechek, David Rogers, Kyle Benjamin, Ross Kenseth (son of Cup runner-up Matt Kenseth), Derek Thorn and Donnie Wilson.EtherCAT: Essential for Industrial Automation Solutions

So we’re expected to ignore suffering and death because a lot of races are held and the math doesn’t seem so bad to those who look the away – where suffering occurs. People who care tend to show concern for the dogs; not so much on percentages.
The suffering is real, as we see from the following video footage from Gulf Greyhound Park in Texas:
(Warning: The images are graphic and are not intended for all viewers.)
The Herald-Tribune out of Florida reports on a conflict between the Sarasota Kennel Club and GREY2K USA. It seems officials at the racetrack told GREY2K they were going turn over injury records. But now the SKC is withholding the information, because they claim a GREY2K representative was rude on the phone.
The dogs at greyhound racetracks would trade in their suffering, along with the constant risk of death or severe injuries for just “rude” behavior.PACK MENTALITY BLOG: Compassion - teamed with Science and Logic

Posted on 11/04/2012 3:03:30 PM PST by neverdem
The Rockaways have been one of the hardest hit areas of the city following Superstorm Sandy, with lives lost, houses destroyed, crime on the streets. It has also been a remarkably resilient place, with diehard New Yorkers beginning the daunting work of rebuilding. It will be a long time before the Rockaways returns to normal, though, and it turns out that goes for subway service to the area, too..
The Observer asked if the damage might be as severe as to the Port Jervis line, which was damaged during Hurricane Irene, when debris twisted the tracks out of alignment. It was a job that took three months to complete, but one that was also finished ahead of schedule. Mr. Lhota’s answer underscores just how difficult, and lengthy, rebuilding may prove to be.
“I think it’s worse than the twisted tracks,” Mr. Lhota said. “That was at least on the ground. The foundation of what’s holding it up is severely shot, we have to rebuild it.”
There are regulatory issues as well. Because the line travels through Gateway National Recreation Area, as well as a bird preserve, the federal government has some oversight over any repairs, which means the MTA could have to submit to not only state but also federal environmental reviews when it comes time to approve the rebuilding plan.
“There’s some other issues here, but this is going to take quite a long time, this is going to be a lot of intervention from various different entities that have different oversight over environmental issuesEPA, National Parks, National Wildlife, it’s significant,” Mr. Lhota said.
The situation remains dire and vague as of today, according to a release this morning from the MTA about the restoration of service: “The Rockaway branch of the A train requires extensive reconstruction and no timetable has been established for resumption of service there.”
The Rockaways, aka Rockaway & Rockapulco, is the long skinny peninsula south of Brooklyn and Queens. It's about 10 miles long. I lived there for 6 years until 2000. Family and friends have been going there for generations in Rockaways's bungalows. Here's.
Someone oughta call Hank Rearden and Dagny Taggert.
Oh, wait......
“...the MTA could have to submit to not only state but also federal environmental reviews when it comes time to approve the rebuilding plan.”
Environmental reviews? 5, maybe 10 years?
Folks in the Rockaways better hope Obama looses.

FReepmail me if you want on or off my New York ping list.
Without wheels in Rockaway, they're screwed. In normal times it can be almost an hour driving into Manhattan.
Let’s see, they will have to meet yet to be written regulations from EPA, National Parks and others. I think the final train for these folks has already left the station. I’m sure if anyone were to remind BO what he said about cutting red tape he would respond that he was only talking about regulations in place before Sandy hit, not new ones that are being developed while these people wait.
Looks like a good opportunity for some enterprising fairy operators, unless that is controlled also.
I think he’s being a bit dramatic. All applicable environmental documentation requirements were waived by the Federal government when the I-35W bridge was replaced after it collapsed in August 2007. NYC should have no problem getting the same waivers as long as they are basically replacing the bridge “in kind.”
Did you mean ferry operators?
” It can make for a beautiful seen “
Wow! Wirds fayul mee!
Nonsense! That's 3 phone calls, 15 minutes max each, so that's 45 minutes, tops. Obama said so.
It can make for a beautiful seen of families on the beach and fishermen
Who's Obama?
You know, if the folks don’t want non-union crews to get their power on, let them sit in the dark. And if they want ‘free money’ instead of loans like the poor folks in Mississippi and Alabama got, then my sympathy gets close to zero.
Folks are getting the quality of government and services that they voted for.

Whoops. That is what happens when things go from your fingers to the keyboard without first going through your brain. Although I suppose in some states on the east coast fairy operators would be more appropriate.

Thanks for the link. I hope your family is OK. The property losses appear horrific.
Thanks for the ping!
So how did that replacing “in kind” work out for getting the water supply lines rebuilt for Tucson?
Oh, I guess it depends on whose bread is getting buttered.
Nothing against you. It’s just - if these guys get waivers, it is because of where they are and who they know.
I guess that isn’t really a news flash...

The client purchased an existing home and the master bathroom did not have a bath tub. The people loved the location of the house, but the wife definitely enjoys a soak in the tub every night.
There were two closets in the master suite and I knew we could turn one into a spa like tub room for her.
This view is showing the beveled glass tub room doors where a closet use to be in the dressing room that leads into the actual bathroom. Directly across from the doors is their closet. I added an additional closet in the master wing of the home that accommodated the wife much more efficiently than the small closet I omitted.

For further infoAnd after the wedding, we left on our Honeymoon. We decided to go on a cruise to Alaska for several reasons. We chose Alaska because my mother had been on an Alaskan cruise and enjoyed it a lot. We decided on a cruise because I didn't want to have to actually plan much of the trip.
The cruise left from Seattle. We had one fairly rough day at sea, which we spent mostly in bed, napping. Except for the sea sickness, that day was pretty darn enjoyable.
Our first stop was in Juneau. We went whale watching. We saw whales, including one who was breaching. That's when they fling themselves out of the water and crash back down, presumably to impress other whales. It's apparently unusual to see them do that in Alaka. Normally, they reserve that behavior for Hawaii, where they are getting busy with the mating. I didn't take any pictures of whales because, having whale watched before, I knew the pictures would all look like water with little black dots ("Oh look! It's a tail!").
In Juneau, we also visited Mendenhall Glacier. We were going to hike up to the waterfall that can be seen over Mike's shoulder, but the trail was completely flooded out. As in entirely submerged under water. We viewed the glacier from the viewpoint instead. I thought we needed quite a bit more time at the glacier. We didn't have time to go through the visitor center other than watching their 7 minute movie on glaciers.
Our next stop was Skagway. We went on an early morning train ride up into the mountains. Lots of very nice scenery, but the weather was a little overcast, so my pictures are mostly of trees with fog. We did see a bear! It was sort of meandering along beside the tracks. I happened to see it because I spent a lot of time looking down at the ground near-ish to the train looking for squirrels (never saw any). I'm not sure many other people on the train actually saw the bear because they were all looking off into the distance at scenery. The bear was right next to the train and looked up at me as we rolled on by. Closest I've ever been to a bear, by far.
Here we are, on a platform on the train. In the background, you can see trees with fog.
That afternoon, we went ziplining. The zipline people took us up into the rainforest and we went on 5 different ziplines. There wasn't particularly different, exciting things to be seen from the zipline that couldn't be seen from the ground, but we did finally see our first squirrels.
There were also salmon spawning. We saw these from the train, then walked back through the town to find them after ziplining. I was exhausted at the end of this day.
We spent a morning in Glacier Bay. We had a balcony room, which meant that we could hang out on the balcony and admire the glaciers. They were huge and blue and made all sorts of cracking, popping noises.
Here's another glacier off in the distance. There's no sense of scale in Alaska. You can tell that things are "big", but there's really no way to see how big they are. For example, the glacier behind us in the picture above is something like 250 feet tall.
Next stop, Ketchikan. We went on a tour of Totem Bight Park. There were totem poles. The tour guide was very good. After the totem poles, we went to a lumberjack show, which was pretty corny but entertaining. And that was it for Ketchikan.
The last stop was Victoria, BC. We were there at night and saw Butchart Gardens and the Butterfly Gardens. I would totally go back to Butchart Garden to see it in the daylight. It was quite dark by the time we got to the end. All of the butterflies were roosting, which made them easier to photograph, but not quite so exciting to watch. I don't highly recommend butterfly gardens after sundown.
Overall, it was a very enjoyable trip. We ate very well on the ship. I fell asleep every time I stopped moving because the rocking of the boat was just very soothing. We only had the one day of roughish weather and other than that, sea sickness wasn't much of a problem. Beautiful scenery was always just outside our door and could be viewed from bed while reading a book. What more could you want?
Sounds like a wonderful trip! The pics are beautiful. Glad you had fun!Four tetranuclear complexes involving both homo- and hetero-metal combinations, viz. [ZnII2L2(μ4-PhCOO)2ZnII2(hfac)2] (1), [CdII2L2(μ4-PhCOO)2CdII2(hfac)2] (2), [ZnII2L2(μ4-PhCOO)2TbIII2(hfac)4] (3), and [CdII2L2(μ4-PhCOO)2TbIII2(hfac)4] (4) have been prepared following a single-pot synthesis protocol using N,N′-dimethyl-N,N′-bis(2-hydroxy-3,5-dimethylbenzyl)ethylenediamine (H2L) as a primary ligand. Both benzoate and hexafluoroacetylacetonate (hfac−), used here as ancillary ligands, play crucial roles in generating a tetranuclear core with high thermodynamic stability. Oxygen atoms of each carboxylate moiety bind all the four metal centers together in a rare η2:η2:μ4-bridging mode as confirmed by X-ray crystallography. In the homo-metallic complexes (1 and 2), the metal centers are all lying in a square plane, each occupying a corner, and remain connected together by oxygen bridges forming octagonal metallacrowns. These structures remain intact in solution as confirmed by 1H NMR spectroscopy and photoluminescent studies. In the hetero-metal complexes (3 and 4), the metal centers are arrayed in alternate positions of the tetranuclear core. The TbIII centers have eight coordinate bi-capped trigonal prismatic coordination environments with different degrees of distortions. The all oxygen O8 core surrounding each TbIII center is devoid of solvent molecules that make fluorescent emission from these molecules (3 and 4) quite interesting. The hfac−-based 1(π–π*) emissions observed in 1 and 2 are quenched in 3 and 4. These sensitized TbIII emissions [5D4 → 7Fj; j = 6, 5, 4, and 3] are influenced by the local environments surrounding the 4f-metal center. The lifetime for the luminescence decay of 3 (5D4 → 7F5 transition) is about 1.5 times longer than that of 4 in all the solvents studied at 298 K.Billiard Bill Set

TribLIVE Sports Videos
Michael Fulmore had something up his sleeve, bringing in a blast from the past to training camp in order to display the rich history of Wilkinsburg football.
He welcomed former Pitt star and NFL player Darnell Dinkins to speak to his 2013 Tigers, hoping to motivate the group into regaining the form of past championship-caliber teams and grow them into men.
“I have the best job in the world,” Fulmore said. “I help young guys develop into men. I see it as an opportunity to see what they are capable of, and I'm excited to see that.”
Wilkinsburg went 3-6 overall and 2-6 in the Class A Eastern Conference last season.
The Tigers finished strong, winning three of their final four games to give Fulmore and the rest of the Wilkinsburg football staff hope for success this season.
“We finished the season with a big win over Avonworth,” Fulmore said. “I'm really excited to see if my team holds it to that standard this season.”
Fulmore, who also will be taking on the athletic director duties at Wilkinsburg, hopes to see a lot of the close losses from last season turn into wins this year.
“We were in some pretty close games at home,” he said. “... I really am optimistic about this year, and I think we can win some of the close.In the election for the first Congress the federalists were successful. Both the senators chosen by the legislature, Samuel Johnston and Benjamin Hawkins, were federalists. Three of the representatives, Williamson, John Steele, and John Sevier, were also federalists, while their opponents succeeded in electing only two, John B. Ashe and Timothy Bloodworth.
Political interest centered around the financial program of Alexander Hamilton, which appealed to the commercial and financial rather than to the agricultural sections of the country. The assumption of state debts was condemned in resolutions of the legislature which declared that assumption without the consent of the states would be "an infringement of the sovereignty of this state, and prove eventually injurious and oppressive."1 The senators and representatives were directed to prevent the evil operations of such acts in any future assumption. Senator Johnston favored the funding of the national debt, but desired that distinction should be made between original purchasers and speculators. In the meantime the congressmen did not arrive at New York until after the funding of the national debt was provided for, but their vote did prevent temporarily the assumption of the state debts. The objections of North Carolina to this measure were well stated by Williamson; that it would increase the burden of taxation, that North Carolina p48had already imposed taxes to meet its Revolutionary debt, that one of the amendments to the Constitution recommended at the Hillsboro convention was that no state should be interfered with in the redemption of its paper currency or the liquidation of its securities, that no settlement should be made by the Federal Government until the accounts of each state in the United States should be settled, and that if any debt were assumed it should consist of the amount due from the Federal Government to the states. In the end there was a compromise, the national capital being located in the South in return for sufficient votes to carry the assumption bill. However the North Carolina delegation unanimously voted against assumption, and the legislature filed the following protest:
Resolved, That the assumption of state debts by the Congress of the United States, without their particular consent, is an infringement on the sovereignty of this state, and may prove eventually injurious and oppressive to the same, dangerous to its interests, and senators and representatives are directed to prevent evil operation of such acts in future assumptions.2
No less unanimous was the opposition of North Carolina to the excise. Resolutions were adopted by the legislature instructing its senators to oppose the measure. Distant markets made money scarce and price high; hence the surplus grain crop was distilled into whiskey and was peddled by the farmers on their way to market, thus becoming an important money product. John Steele, federalist, declared "a more exceptional mode of taxation could not be devised than the excise. A direct or poll tax would not be so odious. Such was the aversion of the people to it that they would prefer almost any alternative."3 In order to equalize the burden, Williamson suggested that taxes should also be levied on beer and cider, and on the final vote Steele and Williamson, as well as Ashe and Bloodworth, were in the opposition. Resistance to the excise was threatened in the western counties, but the following year the law was revised, exempting the p49smaller stills from the tax, and so relieving most of the North Carolina farmers from its operation.
On the bank bill there was a division among the North Carolina representatives, Sevier and Steele favoring, and Ashe, Bloodworth and Williamson opposing it. The Jay treaty of 1795 was also the source of considerable criticism. The objection on the part of North Carolina was made by Holland, who declared that article nine, which enabled aliens to hold land in the United States, would put in jeopardy titles in the Granville district, which had been taken over by the state during the Revolution, and that if the article was ratified and applied to the lands in question, it would be resisted by force.4 Likewise the provision in the treaty for the liquidation of British debts was contrary to the interests of the commercial classes in Eastern Carolina. On the final vote all the North Carolina congressmen except one, William B. Grove, voted with the opposition.
Interesting also to note was the prevalent feeling towards the act of 1789 organizing the federal judiciary. Davie, staunch defender of the federal system in 1788, wrote that the judiciary act was "so defective in point of arrangement, and so obscurely drawn, or expressed, that, in my opinion, it would disgrace the composition of the meanest legislature of the State."5 Even Samuel Johnston, arch-federalist, wrote from Philadelphia:— "The House have not given up the idea of a reform in the judicial system; I do everything in my power to keep it up."6
The reaction against federalist policies was not confined to speeches and votes in Congress. Within the state there was a strong sentiment against various measures of Washington's administration. In 1790 the House of Commons refused to take an oath to support the Federal Constitution. In the same year also a state court of equity refused to obey a writ of certiorari issued by the Federal District Court ordering a case to be brought before it, and the legislature passed a vote of thanks to the state judges for their action. p50Nor was this restiveness toward centralizing tendencies confined to the opposition. In 1793 James Iredell, who had been appointed a member of the United States Supreme Court by Washington, wrote a dissenting opinion in the case of Chisholm vs. Georgia, holding that Chisholm could not sue the State of Georgia, on the ground that the states were completely sovereign in regard to the powers they had not delegated to the Federal Government. This was the first states' rights opinion emanating from the court; Iredell's theory of divided sovereignty became the working theory of the Federal Government, and was a factor in that public opinion which resulted in the twelfth amendment.
Federalist conception of the relation of senators and congressmen to state authority also played a part in the reaction against the party. Prior to the adoption of the Constitution it had been the custom for the state's delegates in the Continental Congress to correspond with the governor regarding national affairs and to visit the annual sessions of the legislature, and to take instructions from the body that elected them. Gradually under the new regime there developed an aversion to this tradition. First to revolt were the senators; Johnston and Hawkins did not give an account of their stewardship at the sessions of the legislature, and Johnston voted for the excise bill, against which instructions had been adopted. Hence, early as 1790 the legislature adopted resolutions directing senators to use their efforts for open sessions of the Senate, and that they correspond with the legislature when it was in session and with the governor between sessions. On the expiration of Johnston's term in 1792, he was replaced by Alexander Martin. Although the federalist members of the lower house were not yet in revolt against the idea of responsibility to the legislature, the reaction against their party reached its height in 1793 when the republicans carried all the congressional districts save one the Cape Fear, and from then to the end of our early party history the republicans elected a majority of the North Carolina congressmen. President Washington himself was not spared partisan criticism. In 1794 Timothy Bloodworth made an issue of the President's neutrality proclamation, was p51elected to the legislature, and became senator in 1795 in place of Hawkins. In Congress the reply to Washington's last address was criticized by Nathaniel Macon as too adulatory, and Macon, Blount, Holland, and Matthew Locke voted against its adoption. In the presidential election of 1796 Adams received only one electoral vote from North Carolina.
The revolt of the state from federalist control did not escape the attention of republican leaders elsewhere. By 1798 there was a movement to induce North Carolina to join in a revolt against the alien and sedition laws. John Taylor, of Caroline, Virginia, suggested to Thomas Jefferson that Virginia and North Carolina secede and form the nucleus of a new confederation. Jefferson was equally dissatisfied with federalist policies, but he placed union above section. "If we reduce our union to Virginia and North Carolina," he wrote, "immediately the conflict will be established between the representatives of these two small states and they will end by breaking into other simple units."7 Jefferson therefore suggested that a protest only be made against the notorious alien and sedition acts, and that North Carolina join with Virginia in that protest. However, in 1798 there was a strong federalist reaction in North Carolina; hence Kentucky was chosen by Jefferson to join in the protest instead of North Carolina, and the articles adopted were known as the Virginia-Kentucky resolutions.
The cause of the federalist reaction referred to was resentment toward the French government, its perfidy and insult to the United States being revealed in the X. Y. Z. Correspondence. The war fever was aroused, federalists and republicans rallying to the support of the President. In the local elections of 1798 the federalists won a majority in the State Senate, Davie was elected governor by the legislature, and in the congressional elections six districts went federalist. An address to the President of the United States, expressing loyalty and co-operation, was drafted by the legislature. Consequently when the Kentucky resolutions were submitted to the legislature of North Carolina there was no p52response; in the Senate resolutions instructing the state's delegation in Congress to work for the repeal of the alien and sedition laws were defeated, but similar resolutions were adopted in the Commons, where the republicans had a majority. Also Alexander Martin failed to be reelected to the United States Senate on account of his vote for the alien and sedition laws; his successor was Jesse Franklin.
Such was the drift of politics as the presidential election of 1800 approached. The federalists, encouraged by recent victories, hoped to carry the state for Adams. But the issue of war with France was removed by the treaty of 1799. Hence the federalist appeal to loyalty could apply only to the reports of secession sentiment in Virginia. To assure victory a bill was introduced in the legislature of 1799 to place the choice of presidential electors in the legislature. It was defeated by a small republican majority in the House. The early federalist prospects for victory did not mature. The party experienced a loss of leadership. Iredell died in 1799, Samuel Johnston was in his dotage, Davie resigned as governor to accept a mission to France, and was abroad when the election took place. Moreover Spaight and Stone, two of the congressmen elected in 1798, demanded a repeal of the alien and sedition laws and finally left the party. Contemporary with this loss of leadership by the federalists, a new and powerful factor did much to rally the republicans. This was the Raleigh Register, the first republican newspaper in the state. It was established in 1799, its first number appearing on October 22. Its editor was Joseph Gales, an English radical, who had been forced to leave his native country on account of the opinions contained in his paper, the Sheffield Register. In 1795 he arrived in Philadelphia and soon became known as an expert reporter of proceedings in Congress. Realizing the need of a party organ in North Carolina, Nathaniel Macon and other republicans persuaded Mr. Gales to come to Raleigh and establish the Register. The editorials were spirited and readable, and during the campaign copies of the paper were sent to a large number of doubtful voters free of charge. Alarmed by the aggressiveness of the Register, William Boylan, editor of the Minerva, p53moved his paper, which was federalist, from Fayetteville to Raleigh. Thus begins the history of the partisan press in North Carolina. An interesting incident was a physical conflict between the two editors on the streets of Raleigh. Gales brought suit for damages against Boylan. The trial was removed to Hillsboro. The jury awarded the plaintiff damages of £100, and Gales, after paying the attorney's fees, donated the remainder to the Raleigh Academy. The influence of Gales and his paper extended beyond the confines of North Carolina. He secured an interest in the National Intelligencer, organ of the republicans at Washington, and in 1807 Joseph Gales, Jr., became the congressional reporter and in 1810 sole owner of the Intelligencer. In 1812 he was joined in the ownership by his brother, William W. Gales, who p54had for three years been associated with the elder Gales in the Register. On the retirement of Joseph Gales, Sr., the editorship of the Register was continued by his son, Western R. Gales.
The result of the presidential election of 1800 was a victory for the republicans. However, the federalists secured four of the electoral votes, quite a gain over the vote of 1796. This was undoubtedly due to the reaction against France and the strong appeal to conserve the Union made by the federalists.
The election of 1800 marks a revolution in American politics, a decisive victory of the Jeffersonian republicans over federalism, yet as far as North Carolina was concerned there was in the election no guarantee of permanent supremacy. The four electoral votes for Adams suggest a rugged independence when contrasted with the solid vote of Virginia, South Carolina, and Georgia for Jefferson. There were also four federalist congressmen, and until the end of the Second War with England the Salisbury, Fayetteville, and Edenton districts manifested distrust of republican measures. Some of the clergy were also hostile to the recent political change: a minister in Orange County prayed that "God would send the name of Republicanism to its native Hell." Moreover federalistic ideals had attracted men of ability, vision, and character. With the return of Davie from France early in 1801, plans were laid for opposition to the new regime. Consequently Jefferson and his advisors did not rest easy with laurels recently won. A new weapon was found in the federal patronage. Macon wished to make party loyalty the sole test for appointment; instead, Jefferson adopted the policy of offering certain high offices to federalists in order to weaken their party allegiance. Hence Benjamin Hawkins was appointed one of the commissioners to the Creek Indians, and was also consulted concerning other appointments. Davie likewise accepted a commission to treat with those Tuscarora Indians who had not removed from North Carolina. John Steele, first Comptroller of the United States Treasury, remained in office until his resignation in 1802.
The undoing of the North Carolina federalists was not p55accomplished by Jefferson's seductive policy but by their indifference, if not resistance, to the popular will. This was disclosed in their attitude toward the repeal of the Judiciary Act of 1801. By that law the federalists had increased the number of circuits and created a number of circuit judgeships to which President Adams had appointed federalists. One of Jefferson's measures of reform was to have the law repealed on the ground that it was unnecessary. The North Carolina legislature, thoroughly in sympathy with the Jeffersonian idea, instructed the senators and recommended to the representatives, to vote for the repeal. However the four federalist members of the House from North Carolina disregarded the recommendation and voted against repeal. Their explanation was partly expediency, that an increase of circuits and judges was actually needed, and also constitutionality, that the repeal of the law violated the independence of the judiciary. Two of the members defended at length their vote before the House. Stanly declared: "Should this measure pass it will be the first link in that chain of measures which will add the name of America to the melancholy catalogue of fallingº republics." Henderson exclaimed: "If the doctrine intended by the gentleman of the other side of the House should become the settled construction of the Constitution and enlightened America acquiesce with that construction, I declare for myself, for myself alone, I would not heave a sigh or shed a tear over its total dissolution. The wound you are about to give it will be mortal; it may languish out a mere existence for a few years, but it will surely die. It will neither serve to protect its friends nor defend itself from the omnipotent energies of its enemies. Better at once to bury it with all our hopes."8 These remarks clearly indicate a lack of sympathy of the federalists with Jeffersonian ideals. Failure to heed the instructions of the legislature raised the issue of responsibility to the popular will, and in the election of 1804 there was a reaction, the state sending a solid republican delegation to Congress. An interesting incident of the campaign was the contest between Davie and Alston p56in the Halifax district. Alston was victorious and Davie, chagrined at defeat, retired from politics and from the state, spending the remaining years of his life on his plantation on the Catawba River in South Carolina.
The victory over federalism was not followed by unanimity toward dominant republican policies. The same independence that characterized federalism in North Carolina was also a feature of the republican party. Illustrative was the attitude of Nathaniel Macon. As Jefferson was the idealogue of democracy, Macon personified democracy through character. Honesty, economy, simplicity, and the rights of the states as the best protection of the agricultural interests, were principles concerning which he was uncompromising. Elected Speaker of the House of Representatives in 1801 in recognition of North Carolina's loyalty to the republican cause, he soon realized that his ideals did not permit an unqualified support of the administration. With the impeachment of the federalist judges he had little sympathy, believing that public opinion did not demand it. He opposed the policy of the government to recognize the validity of the land grants which had been made and then revoked by the legislature of Georgia in the Yazoo district, which had been ceded to the United States in 1802. With the co-operation of John Randolph of Virginia he was successful in his opposition, for no settlement of the claims was made until 1814, after their validity had been established by the Supreme Court. Moreover, Macon did not favor the rise of Madison to power, who was slated for the presidential succession, but preferred Gallatin of Pennsylvania. How stiff-necked the Speaker might become is shown by his vote on the resolution submitting the twelfth amendment to the Constitution to the states; it lacked one vote to make the required two‑thirds majority. Macon claimed the right, as a member of the House, to cast a vote for the measure, overruled the opinion that the Speaker's vote was limited to tie cases, and thus the amendment was submitted.
Macon was not alone in his disaffection. Of one mind with him were John Randolph, of Virginia, whom Macon appointed chairman of the Ways and Means Committee, and Nicholson, of Maryland. These insurgents were known as the p57"Quids," and frequently voting with them were Richard Stanford, of Hillsboro, Thomas Wynns, of Hertford, and Joseph Winston, of Surry County. In 1806 rank and file of the House became restive over the disaffection of these members. In order to shelve Randolph as chairman of the Ways and Means Committee, there was a movement to take from the Speaker the right of appointing standing committees. It failed by only two votes. Macon, yielding to the desire of the majority, appointed Joseph Clay of Pennsylvania to head the committee of which Randolph had been chairman since 1801. The following year Macon himself lost the speakership; he then became reconciled to the leadership of Madison and also broke with Randolph.
In the meantime foreign affairs became the dominant national problem. In the efforts toward their solution Macon and his colleagues from North Carolina manifested their independence. In reply to England's interference with American trade, Congress in April, 1806, enacted the non-importation law, which prohibited the importation from England of such goods as could be manufactured in the United States. It was criticized by Macon, who feared war would result, by pointing out that any diminution of the customs would require increase of the internal taxes, which would be a burden to the South. However, at the final vote on the measure the only North Carolinian in opposition was Richard Stanford. Non-importation was a failure. It was followed by grave insults over the right of search and a more drastic interference with American shipping by the French decrees and the British orders in council. Upon Jefferson's recommendation Congress adopted the embargo act of 1807, which forbade American ships to engage in foreign trade. Macon did not approve of the measure, and on the final vote five of the North Carolina representatives were among the nays, Blackledge, Alexander, Culpepper, Holland, and Stanford. The embargo forced no concession from Europe and created discontent at home. It was superseded by the non-intercourse act of 1809, which prohibited trade with France and England, but sanctioned it with the countries not under their control. Again p58the North Carolina delegation was divided. Macon favored continuance of the embargo, believing total severance of trade relations to be the best guarantee against war, and of like mind were Blackledge, Blount, and Stanford. When negotiations with England proved fruitless, Macon, as chairman of the special committee on foreign relations, introduced a measure which, if adopted, might have forced England to terms and so have avoided war. Its principle was that of the British navigation acts, closing the ports of the United States to British and French ships and admitting goods of those nations only when imported directly in American vessels. This was an administration measure framed after consultation with Madison and Gallatin. Although it passed the House, it met defeat in the Senate, due to a faction in the party bitterly hostile to Gallatin. Thereupon in April, 1810, Macon reported a new measure, really the work of Taylor of South Carolina. It repealed the non-intercourse act, making commercial relations free, but authorized the President to prohibit trade with England or France in case one of them revoked its commercial decree. The law was known as Macon Bill No. 2. It proved ineffective. Napoleon promised revocation of the French decrees. Madison thereupon suspended intercourse with England, but Napoleon did not fulfill his promise, and the French continued to seize American ships. These results were doubtless no surprise to Macon, for he had voted against the law, and likewise Archibald McBryde, John Stanly, and Richard Stanford.
The demoralization of trade resulting from the failure to adjust foreign relations threatened a party crisis in North Carolina. In 1808 three of the electoral votes were cast for Pinckney, federalist candidate, and in the congressional campaign also the federalists carried four districts, William Kennedy being elected from the Tarboro, Archibald McBryde from the Fayetteville, Joseph Pearson from the Salisbury, and John Stanly from the Newbern district. Moreover there was division in the republican ranks. Willis Alston of the Halifax district showed marked independence by voting for the recharter of the national bank in 1811. p59Lemuel Sawyer, of Edenton, denounced efforts at compromise in foreign relations, and declared that only war would meet the situation, while Richard Stanford often voted with the federalists. Hence as the presidential election of 1812 approached, there was alarm lest the federalists carry the state. To prevent such a catastrophe, the legislature of 1811 transferred the choice of electors from the people to the legislature in order that Madison might receive the full vote of the state. However the measure proved unpopular. In the legislature of 1812 there were sixty federalists, among them Gaston, Steele, Stanly, Grove, and Henderson. Nor was the measure popular with the republicans. James Mebane, the member who had introduced it, was defeated by Murphey, and when the legislature of 1812 met, the federalists and anti-electoral republicans procured the repeal of the law and the adoption of a resolution proposing an amendment to the Federal Constitution guaranteeing popular choice of electors. In the meantime the war fever increased, especially in the Southwest, and war was declared on England on July 18, 1812. However, Pearson, McBryde, and Stanford voted against the declaration, and David Stone, elected senator in 1812, was soon out of sympathy with the policy of the Government.
The war aroused considerable martial response in North Carolina. The call for 7,000 militia by the federal authorities, the state's quota of 100,000 to be detached for United States service, was met almost entirely by volunteers. However the problems of equipment and coast defense were serious and became the subject of controversy. According to state law members of the militia should arm and equip themselves, a task well-nigh impossible considering the unusual number called out. Moreover the kind of arms used in the United States service was not to be had, because the act of Congress of 1808 requiring a deposit of federal arms among the states had not been complied with so far as North Carolina was concerned. Hence equipment for the militia was not secured until the legislature appropriated $50,000 for supplies and $25,000 for arms in 1813, and $55,000 for arms in 1814. Reimbursement for these expenditures became a matter of controversy p60between the state and federal governments, and the matter to this day has not been settled. The coast defenses were inadequate. At Wilmington were half a dozen gun boats, all out of commission. Shortly before the war opened companies of regular troops at Fort Johnston, below Wilmington, and Fort Hampton, near Beaufort, were withdrawn. Thus the state was virtually unprotected from invasion. In May, 1813, citizens of Beaufort and Wilmington petitioned Governor Hawkins concerning defense. The Governor in turn laid the case before the War Department, and Senators Stone and Turner interviewed President Madison.
Anxiety was well grounded, for on July 11, 1813, Admiral Cockburn, with a fleet of one seventy-four, three frigates, one brig, and three schooners appeared off the coast, entered Ocracoke Inlet, landed at Portsmouth and Shell Castle, seized two American vessels,a destroyed considerable personal property, and impressed live stock. Governor Hawkins at once organized a relief expedition, consisting of the militia of the central and eastern counties, but the British sailed southward for Florida without attacking Beaufort or Wilmington. There were no further raids of sufficient import to call out the militia. The only activities of the North Carolina troops during the war were beyond the boundaries of the state. In 1814 a regiment was sent to the Creek country and another to Norfolk, Virginia, and in 1815 a third was ordered for service on the Southern frontier of the United States.
The state's martial association with the conflict was principally through the achievements of three individuals, Otway Burns, Johnston Blakeley, and Benjamin Forsythe. Of these three Burns only operated from North Carolina. When the war began, he was in command of a merchantman plying between Newbern and Portland, Maine. At once he purchased a larger and swifter ship, which he named the "Snap Dragon," took out letters of marque and reprisal, organized a stock company to defray initial expenses, and for two years preyed on British commerce all the way from Newfoundland to South America. The amount of spoils taken is unknown, but one voyage brought in $2,500,000 worth. Auctions of
p62 the booty held in Newbern were attended by merchants and traders and were advertised as far west as Raleigh. In June, 1814, the "Snap Dragon," then under command of a lieutenant, was captured by the British. Other privateers plying from North Carolina ports were the "Lovely Lass," of Wilmington, the "Hero," of Newbern, and the "Hawk," of Washington.
In the navy lasting fame was achieved by Johnston Blakeley. A native of Ireland, educated at the University of North Carolina, he became a midshipman in 1800 and by July, 1813, had risen to the rank of master commandant. In charge of the "Enterprise," he captured the British brig of the same name, and was then transferred to the "Wasp," a sloop built after the war opened, with an armament of twenty thirty-two pounders and two eighteen-pounders. Running the British blockade at Portsmouth, New Hampshire, Blakeley sailed straight for the English channel, and for two months during the summer of 1814 he was the terror of English merchantmen. He also won two naval victories, one over the British brig "Reindeer," for which Congress voted him a gold medal, the other over the sloop "Avon." His ship mysteriously disappeared in August, 1814.
In the army laurels were won by Benjamin Forsythe. A native of Stokes County, he was appointed second lieutenant of the Sixth United States Infantry in 1800, but was soon after honorably discharged. In 1808 he re-entered the service as captain, and in 1813 was promoted to the rank of major, and in 1814 to that of lieutenant-colonel. During the war his regiment was stationed at Ogdensburg on Canadian frontier, and was very active in operations along the St. Lawrence River, notably in the capture of Elizabethtown, in February, 1813, and of Fort George in May of the same year. Forsythe himself was slain in a skirmish near Odelltown on June 28, 1814.
Notable as were the achievements of Blakeley and Forsythe, their most memorable service was to awaken in North Carolina a sentiment of state pride and public spirit. The legislature voted Blakeley a sword; when it became known that the "Wasp" and her commander were lost, the legislature p63also resolved to make his infant daughter, Udney Maria, a ward of the state, by providing for her education. Likewise, the legislature made a ward of Forsythe's son, James N., by providing for his education. Annual appropriations were made for young Forsythe until 1825, when he left the University and entered the navy. Then the lump sum of $750 was ordered to be invested for him, principal and interest to be paid upon reaching his maturity. However the young man lost his life in the wreck of the "Adinet" in 1829 before he received the endowment established for him. The annual appropriation for Maria Blakeley was continued until 1829. The interest and generosity shown by these appropriations were in strong contrast to the apathy toward public causes that had prevailed in earlier years and marked the dawn of a new epoch in public expenditures.
The most important aspect of the war so far as North Carolina was concerned was its political aspects. The conflict opened during a reaction against the leaders of the republican party, caused by the act of 1811 which placed the choice of presidential electors in the legislature rather than the people. Consequently sixty federalists were returned to the legislature of 1812, and in the House of Commons John Steele was defeated for the speakership by a vote of 64 to 59. The obnoxious electoral law was repealed and resolutions were adopted recommending an amendment to the Federal Constitution guaranteeing to the people the choice of presidential electors. Failure of the Federal Government to improve coast defenses was the subject of protest in the session of 1813. Resolutions that were really a censure of the War Department were defeated after a warm debate; a more moderate memorial was adopted expressing disappointment at the neglect of coast defenses in the past and asking protection for the future. The memorial was presented to the President; the only result was an inspection of the defenses by an agent of the War Department. The same session failed to provide for the assumption of the state's quota of the federal land tax.
Criticism and defense of the national administration also p64pervaded federal politics. Secret sessions and curtailment of debate in Congress in the early months of the war aroused protest by a number members, a magistrate whom was Joseph Pearson. In 1812 a public meeting in Mecklenburg condemned his attitude, while another in Rowan approved it and also declared that the war was unwise and should be brought to an end. In the congressional elections of 1813 the issue of direct taxes or honorable peace was raised. Four federalist congressmen were elected, Joseph Pearson, John Culpepper, William Gaston, and Richard Stanford. In Congress they joined with fellow partisans from New England and the middle states in opposing various war measures. Culpepper, Gaston, and Pearson all voted against the salt taxes of 1813, Stanford joined them in opposing the tax on liquor dealers, Culpepper, Pearson, and Stanford fought the embargo of 1813, and Gaston joined them in a demand for non-interference with the coastwise trade and the successful movement for its repeal. Culpepper, Pearson, and Stanford voted against the military appropriation of March, 1814, and all four voted against the loan bill of that month authorizing the issue of $25,000,000 in bonds. The chief spokesman of the group was Gaston. Bitter in denouncing the American policy that had precipitated war, he opposed military operations in Canada while negotiations were pending with England, early in 1814, and held before Congress the spectre of a slave insurrection in the South in case of a British invasion. How strong was the spirit of partisanship is illustrated by an incident of January 21, 1814. Eppes, chairman of the Ways and Means Committee, read to the House the report of the Secretary of the Treasury, laying bare a condition of practical bankruptcy. He then turned to Gaston and said:
"Well, sir! Will your party take the government if we will give it up to them?"
"No, sir," replied Gaston. "No, sir! Not until you will give it to us as we gave it to you."9
Criticism of war measures reached a climax in the discussion of the record of David Stone. Elected to the United p65States Senate in 1812, he opposed the embargo of 1813, the appointment of Albert Gallatin as one of the commissioners to Europe in response to Russia's attempt at mediation, and the direct levies on sugar, liquor licenses, and auctioneers as a means of financing the war. A public meeting in Camden County censured Mr. Stone and demanded that he "retire into merited obscurity, vacate his seat in Congress, forbear to let the sound of his unhallowed voice pollute that patriotic sanctuary." In the legislature of 1813 his record became the subject of debate. Resolutions of censure were indefinitely postponed in the House of Commons, but the question was reopened and similar resolutions were sent down for concurrence from the senate. The report of a joint committee was then adopted by both houses, which declared that Senator Stone had "disappointed the reasonable expectations, and incurred the disapprobation of this General Assembly." A protest, however, against the resolutions was filed by a minority. Senator Stone remained impervious to criticism until December, 1814, when he resigned, giving as his reason for such action the pressure of private business. As a parting shot he declared it unwise to continue the embargo, to use the militia in distant operations, to tolerate short terms of enlistment, and to send peace commissioners to Europe.

Page updated: 29 Jun 14"Power-over is linked to domination and control...[it] comes from the consciousness I have termed estrangement: the view of the world as made up of atomized, nonliving parts, mechanically interacting, valued not for what they inherently are but only in relation to some outside standard...Power-over enables one individual or group to make the decisions that affect others, and to enforce control."-- Starhawk, Truth or Dare, p. 9
This view of power is completely embedded in our culture, to the extent that it is considered self-evident - "common sense is communal sense". It seems obvious to us that power equals control, and those with more ability to control others have more power. In fact, it's often hard to conceive of any other sort of power. However, just by defining power as something which one person has over another is giving legitimacy to the idea that one person should have power over another, or at the very least normalizing it, so that it no longer seems odd to us that people "in power" are given the authority to direct other people and make decisions for them. This is the power of language and ideas to shape our experience of ourselves and our lives. (This is all from a decidedly postmodern perspective, of course.)
Social movements that aim to rectify inequalities or injustices will ultimately fail if they do not challance the structure within which the inequalities are imbedded. This is the failure of most revolutions: the dictator, czar, king, etc is killed because he was abusing his power, and then the revolutionaries set up shop and are soon abusing their power.
Another example is the phenomenon of "Eco-Nazis" - people who are environmentalists but who nitpick other people's shopping decisions or compete to be the most righteously "Green". What they haven't worked out is that the institutions that allow for the exploitation of our planet for profit are inseparably embedded in the systems of oppression that teach us that we are never good enough and that we have to be constantly in competetition with each other for legitimacy, power, money, etc. (This is a basic tenent of ecofeminism and deep ecology.)
But no movement will truly subvert the systems of oppression if it does not also subvert the paradigm of patriarchy and estrangement. Audre Lorde summed it up as "The master's tools will never dismantle the master's house."

Blackberry started out as a business oriented company. In recent years, they have migrated toward the huge growing smartphone consumer market where the iphone of course dominates.
Your right, most smart phones generally do most things that Blackberries do these days. I still think of them as work devices first and play second though so I think that is why you still run into many that can't live without them.
Android, WebOS, and the iphone OS have newer, slicker operating systems for many. Probably a matter of personal taste for many consumers.

A.B.A is more than a pretty skin in Guilty Gear Isuka, introducing entirely new fight strategies in her unique set of abilities. To use her effectively players will have to balance between two modes: Normal, where she has limited abilities, and Power, where she will dish out more damage but will also deplete her health with each attack. To enter Power Mode, A.B.A uses her own supply of blood packets to transform Paracelsus into a more devastating weapon. Since this blood supply is also the source of her self-healing, her health gauge is depleted with each attack in this state. A.B.A. has another advantage in Power Mode in that she can perform a three-hit combination by unleashing her bandages to damage her foes. If executed successfully, the last hit in this combo will bounce enemies into the air and set the stage for stringing in a second combo. A.B.A’s faster health depletion and slower attack recovery are balanced by great agility to dodge incoming attacks or quickly gain distance from her opponents. She also has one of the most dominant Overdrive Moves of any Guilty Gear character. These strategy nuances and thoughtfully balanced abilities make her yet another notable addition to the Guilty Gear roster.
Coming to PS2 in fall 2004, Guilty Gear Isuka promises a leap forward for the acclaimed 2D fighter series, introducing 4-player simultaneous fighting and an arcade-style side-scrolling action game called Boost Mode. The sequel also adds new characters, all-new fight arenas and new sounds from the series’ trademark Rock & Metal soundtrack.Things are tough all over, but Anya Kamenetz, author of Generation Debt, thinks they may be toughest for young people. So much so that Generation Debt carries the ominous subtitle Why Now Is A Terrible Time To Be Young.
In writing this book, Kamenetz understands that others may perceive her (or her generation) as children who whine “not fair” when things don’t go their way. While she occasionally slips into this voice (“those of us between eighteen and thirty-five have somehow been cheated out of our inheritance,” “it’s not too dramatic to say that the nation is abandoning its children”), Kamenetz overcomes this perception by systematically detailing just how tough things are, and how her generation really could be worse off than that of its parents.
Kamenetz discusses many problems facing young people, including the trend toward jobs without pensions or health care coverage, the use of temps and freelancers over full-time employees, rising government deficits and the potential for future cuts in Medicare and Social Security. Many of these issues cut across all age groups, however. Kamenetz is most convincing, and most compelling, when she outlines the problems unique to young people. One of their biggest problems is paying for college.
While conventional wisdom says that a college degree is almost a requirement for substantial career prospects, skyrocketing tuitions are pricing potential students out of the market. Financial supports that have helped students in the past are less often available – grant money has given way to student loans, subsidized student loans (interest is paid by the government until after graduation) are more often giving way to unsubsidized loans (interest charges begin immediately).
As a result, more students work their way through college, with sizable loans to pay off afterward. Others start college but can’t afford to finish – and the loans they took out still need to be paid. (According to Kamenetz, one in three twenty-somethings is a college dropout, compared to one in five in the late 1960s.) Either way, many come out of their college experience to an unstable job market with a mountain of debt.
Kamenetz interviewed dozens of young people from a variety of backgrounds for Generation Debt, and she sprinkles these personal experiences throughout the book to accentuate her points. It’s an effective tool, with interviewees running the gamut from head-in-the-clouds, how-could-you-be-so-stupid money-wasters to highly responsible people who’ve been thwarted in their attempts to get ahead, whether due to lack of job opportunities, inescapable debt, or inability to pay for an education.
With any book that painstakingly details a problem, a reader inevitably gets weary and says, “O.K., so what do we do about it?” One solution — at least a partial solution — Kamenetz offers young people is to live within their means. Resist easy credit and societal pressures toward material comforts.
A second solution is to fight the power – whether that means on a political level, within a university setting, or on the job. Kamenetz makes it clear she is a liberal, and, while she cites some real examples of young people fighting for their financial rights, I can’t help but question whether her calls for organizing and building political muscle are liberal fantasies. Will students ever again muster the clout they had during the Vietnam War? And if they could, are high college costs or lack of health insurance enough to spur them into action? Nevertheless, I suppose it can’t hurt to try.
Generation Debt is an impressive book, especially when you consider Anya Kamenetz wrote it at 24 years of age. It is well-researched, well-reasoned, and interesting enough that I didn’t feel like putting the book down despite the battering ram of depressing news it offers. While one book won’t change the underlying causes that threaten young people’s prosperity, Generation Debt may help older generations understand the young, and help the young realize they’re not alone.

For as long as it has been an elite summer destination, the Hamptons’ iconic shingle-style homes have ranked among the most expensive in the nation. The often centuries-old waterfront bungalows rarely come on the market, and when they do, they move quickly—despite a price tag upwards of $10 million. Now Harbor’s Edge, the area’s first waterside condominium project, caters to those who want to maintain the Hamptons summer lifestyle without the burden of owning a home.
Located at 21 West Water Street in Sag Harbor, the building is a couple of blocks from Main Street and within walking distance of more than 20 restaurants. Water Street Development in Sag Harbor and Halstead Property Development Marketing opened the 15 condominiums—which include three penthouses—for sale in August. Priced from $2.5 to $6.5 million, the two- and three-bedroom residences feature interiors from Nadine Homann of NH Design Studios and are designed like Manhattan lofts: 10-foot ceilings, custom molding, gas fireplaces, and wide-plank oak flooring. Kitchens are outfitted with stainless-steel appliances, dishwashers, and wine refrigerators, and master baths feature glass-enclosed showers with rain showerheads and adjustable body sprayers. The penthouse units have private garages.
Each residence at Harbor’s Edge will have a private concierge, like that at any four-star resort, during the summer season. The building has private terraces and balconies as well as a rooftop sundeck that includes a 50-foot lap pool, a wet bar, and a kitchen and may be reserved for private events. All of the outdoor spaces (except the pool area) have views of the water. ()After three losses in a row the Cowboys of North Lake School ended up with a win during the week of Jan. 28. Unfortunately, they could not earn two and went 1-1 for the week as a whole.
Playing Paisley at home on Tuesday, Jan. 29, the boys from North Lake were able to put together a team effort and show the lessons they have learned through out the difficult season. Beating Paisley 46-20, it showed a clear view of what Head Coach Brian Baker referred to as “putting together a complete game together.”
In their second match up, the Cowboys were even able to increase the spread, which in their first triumph over Paisley, they were only able to eke out a win by eight points.
The victory could only last so long, however as their Saturday, Feb. 2 match up against Hosanna Christian ended in defeat. The Lions bested the Cowboys with a wide spread of 78-42. A bright side could still be found in the loss as the last time the two teams met, North Lake fell by almost 50 points.There was much squealing, chanting and batting of balloons as Jenny McCarthy made her debut on “The View” Monday morning. “I feel like I’ve won Publisher’s Clearinghouse,” McCarthy said after the balloon drop. She added, “I’m grateful to have a job. I’m a single mother.”
McCarthy caused a stir back in July, when it was announced she would be on the talk show, joining Barbara Walters, Whoopi Goldberg and Sherri Shepherd. Joy Behar and Elizabeth Hasselbeck announced earlier this year that they would leave “The View.”

"New York Times Finally Retracts Clinton Story".

She was referring to the Republican-led Congress “” not Democrats…
This is a victory for the progressive blogosphere, particularly Atrios, who first discovered the error, and Media Matters, which kept the story going. Some questions to consider:

— Will right-wing news sites that picked up the story, including Drudge Report and Newsmax, inform their readers?

That being said, he has not earned the honor of being the guy to end takers streak.
I dont consider Punk old either, 34yo in pro wrestling is like 25 in the NBA. Sure theres more wear and tear and concerns over durabilty as wrestlers get towards 40, but he is 6 years away from that. If Punk put together 6 more years at the level he's on now, with takers streak and this long reign on his resume, the he is easily amongst the greatest of all time. Which is what hes being built towards, and Im not talking about the storyling greatest of all time either. I think vince legitimately wants to find deserving icons and HOFers in each era, punk, cena and hopefully DB are the ones we are seeing now. Cena cant have takers streak, it wont go over well. DB possibly if its not punk. I dont think anyone would be angry about DB getting it.
Easy set up too. DB turns on Kane and retires him or just gets over on him big. Taker for the save, setting up the WM match. Only problem is turning DB to vicious heel when he is so over as a tweener.Sarah Palin visit would not be good for the Tories
Some Tory and right-wing bloggers are getting very excited about the possibility that Sarah Palin, the former GOP VP candidate may visit the UK later this year. Apparently she is keen to meet Margaret Thatcher who is one of her political heroines.
There is even talk that she might address the Tory conference. At the very least it is likely were she to come that David Cameron would have to meet her.
I think a visit from Palin would not be good for the Tories though. Of course she would bring with her the glamour and excitement that she has built up in the last couple of years. But she would also bring with her, her complete lack of understanding of many issues as well as pretty extreme views.
The Conservatives who relish the thought of a Palin visit should bear in mind that many people in this country do not see her as a maverick hero with right on her side but a strange woman with some very suspect views on lots of issues. An association with her risks looking like the party is aligning itself with very right-wing elements, not really what I suspect Team Cameron want to see.
They should also bear in mind that even if she gets the GOP nomination for 2012 (and it is surely pretty likely that someone who is actually good comes through before then) she would be exposed and ridiculed during the election she would then certainly lose. I expect Tina Fey is honing her fantastic impression right now.
Do they really want to associate themselves so closely with an extremist who is likely to be such a big loser in a couple of years' time?
2 comments:
Palin isn't even that popular among Americans. In fact, she's very unpopular outside her base of teabaggers. People really do think of her as shrill and stupid.
Part of me hopes she does run in 2012 and go down in flames.
She would be a perfect example of why the right needs to be led from the center not the far right.
On the other hand, Obama needs to be replaced. He is going to bankrupt the country.
For the record, I am British, a Conservative supporter, and currently living in the socialist mecca that is the San Francisco bay area.Join Pollo Rewards to receive special promotions and updates from Pollo Tropical Restaurants. ( Must Sign Up )

Red Hat Inc. jumped into the Microsoft Corp. class-action suits settlement fray Tuesday, offering to provide open-source software to every school district in the United States free of charge. Red Hat encouraged Microsoft to redirect the money it plans to spend on its own software -- estimated at more than US$500 million -- into purchasing additional hardware.
Microsoft said earlier Tuesday that it had agreed to settle the 100-plus class action suits accusing it of using its desktop operating system software monopoly to charge users inflated prices. Under terms of the deal, Microsoft would supply computers and its own software to thousands of the U.S.'s poorest schools.
Red Hat's alternative proposal, outlined in a press release that betrayed not a hint of sarcasm, is to provide its own operating system software, along with applications and online support, to any interested schools. It urged Microsoft to use the money it would have spent on its own software to instead increase the number of computers it will provide to struggling school districts -- with those computers running free, open-source software instead of Windows and other Microsoft products.
Redirecting Microsoft's money from its own software to third-party hardware would increase the number of computers Microsoft can afford to purchase from 200,000 to more than 1 million, according to Red Hat.
Microsoft representatives didn't immediately return calls seeking comment.
Does the offer of free software for interested schools still stand if Microsoft rejects the alternative settlement suggestion? "Absolutely," said Red Hat Chief Executive Officer (CEO) Matthew Szulik, who noted that Red Hat hadn't discussed its offer with Microsoft.
Microsoft's proposed solution furthers its monopolistic grip on the software market and therefore isn't an effective remedy, Szulik said. And although familiarity with Windows and other Microsoft products is virtually a prerequisite for many jobs these days, schools shouldn't be forced to train their students to use Microsoft software, he argued.
"Would you want your son or daughter to come up learning a set of skills, or learning a specific vendor's product?" he asked. "From my experience as a CEO, I'm much more in favor of people with analytical skills."Dallas police have arrested a man after a standoff at his home that prompted lockdowns at four schools in the Lake Highlands area on Tuesday.
Police said the man barricaded himself inside the residence in the 9400 block of Moss Farm Lane after allegedly threatening to kill a woman during a domestic disturbance.
Dallas SWAT officers entered the home after a search warrant was obtained and arrested the man.
Forrest Meadow Junior High, Merriman Park Elementary, Skyview Elementary and Moss Haven Elementary had "soft" lockdowns in place until 2:15 p.m. because of police activity related to the standoff.
Children were dismissed from school as per their normal routine. But children who live along the streets affected by the standoff were held until their parents could pick them, the Richardson school district said.
The suspect, who was taken to a local hospital for evaluation, will be charged with aggravated assault with a deadly weapon.Blair continues to face questioning over expert's death
Posted
British Prime Minister Tony Blair has faced intense questioning over Iraq at his monthly news conference at Westminster, the first time he has faced the media since the death of Government weapons adviser Dr David Kelly.
Mr Blair said he understood why there would be questions about the apparent suicide of Dr Kelly, but said comment would have to wait until the judicial inquiry was complete.
The British leader repeated that he remains convinced that Iraqi leader Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction.
Mr Blair says he has spoken to many Iraqis, including those on the governing council, about the end of Saddam's regime.
"They tell me there is no doubt at all that the vast majority of people in Iraq are delighted that Saddam has gone," he said.
"That for all the difficulties on security and services and all the rest of it, they are overjoyed that their country's been liberated from the rule of Saddam."

Mount Batu Brinchang, or better known as Gunung Brinchang (Berinchang) has 2 interesting sites.
(1) it is the highest point in Peninsular Malaysia where car can drive up.
(2) the famous mossy forest near the mountain top
We have no luck as the mossy forest was under renovation. Workers were building wooden platform to make this place more accessible. So we could only stop by the road side and snap a few pictures. The handheld pictures were challenging as the forest ground was dim.
I remembered my first trip came up to this place was at night (7:30pm) using the mighty Kancil (the smallest Malaysian car with tiny engine).
We climbed up the lookout point at the Telekom station. According to some guide book, you could see Sumantra from here on a good day. I have never seen a cloudless day on Camera Highlands before, so it remains as a myth to me.
I guess we have to come again on the next trip to visit mossy forest. I think it is better to bring a tripod to have steadier pictures. The forest was wet and muddy. I remembered the nice experience taking off my shoe and walked on the soft mossy plants.
If the mossy forest opens again, many campers like to stay overnight at the entrance (it has a camp site). I bet it will be cold at night. The vegetation was wet with dews and the forest was covered in mist.
“I will be back!” to mossy forest.->''"Heaven doesn't always make the right men kings!"''

Usually, the RegentForLife is the bad guy. We say usually, because in these stories the rightful heir to the throne is usually a [[TheWisePrince heroic figure,]] [[NaiveNewcomer a nice if inexperienced youngster,]] [[TheEveryman or at least a decent guy who can actually claim legitimacy.]] While TheUsur [[InadequateInheritor jaw-droppingly incompetent]]? Or [[BreadEggsBreadedEggs a jaw-droppingly incompetent complete monster]]? Even if he is competent, what happens if the kingdom is facing a terrible crisis it would take a much better leader to deal with?
This is the rare SuccessionCrisis [[RoyalBrat a childish charlatan]] or, even worse, [[TheCaligula actively malicious.]] In this situation, the other claimant has all the qualifications but none of the claim, making for a far more complex (and potentially [[BlackAndGreyMorality grey]]) story.
This trope can also extend into the overthrow of an evil or incompetent monarch, but only cautiously, it has to be another monarch replacing it rather than a non-monarchial LaResistanceOverlord or other evil dictatorial figure for the hero to fight. Used as more than a cheap set up for a villain, this tool sets up a [[{{UsefulNotes/PoliticalIdeologies}} RealLife, however, this trope is a mixed blessing at best. True, your current king may be an improvement, but he has set a precedent that the throne belongs to whomever can connive his way into it -- often enough without the excuse that the current king is worse than he is. It can set the stage for decades if not centuries of civil war.

Now he's still a spoiled juvenile brat, he's unkillable (as long as the dragon he shares a heat with lives) and has the political power of kingship behind him. This turns him full-blown sadist, giddily cracking down even harder on the peasantry and personally abusing anyone he can get away with. The alternative would have been his mother, the kind-hearted and sympathetic queen, but she just ''had'' to [[NiceJobBreakingItHero save her child]]. [[spoiler:She quickly realizes what a mistake this was, and spends a large part of the next several years trying to [[SpannerInTheWorks undermine his worst plans]], up to and including hiring dragon slayers to hunt down his benefactor.]]

* ''Literature/{{Discworld}}'':
** In ''Discworld/WyrdSisters'', Tomjon, the true heir to the throne of Lancre, has no interest in becoming king and wants to become an actor instead. The witches put Verence up as an alternative, claiming that he is Tomjon's half-brother, which is true. They see no need to point out that it's not because they share a father, but a ''mother'' - the Queen got lonely while the king was fooling around with the peasant girls.
** ''Discworld/GuardsGuards'' introduces Carrot, who's the rightful heir to the throne, but believes that the Patrician would do a better job and is perfectly happy to work as Captain of the watch.
*** In later books, Carrot demonstrates he's not entirely Wrongful when he uses the implication of his Rightfulness to push the Patrician in certain directions.

* Creator/MercedesLackey likes this one:
** In the ''Literature/BardicVoices'' series, Kestrel was the rightful king of Birnam after his uncle deposed his father. It turned out that the father was taxing the people heavily and wasting it on personal luxuries while the uncle was ruling the kingdom wisely. Kestrel publicly [[AbdicateTheThrone abdicated the throne]] in favor of his uncle because he did not think himself competent to take it.
** Played with in ''Literature/TheBlackSw ''Literature/HeraldsOfValdemar'' series. The throne of Rethwellen is empty. The King's eldest son and designated heir is poised to take it, and he's a right bastard; the younger SpareToTheThrone was an irresponsible philanderer, but matured after running away to avoid being murdered by his brother and is now leading a rebellion to take the crown. The twist comes in with the fact that the Crown Prince is not ''necessarily'' the legitimate heir; the country has only ''defaulted'' to boring old succession because [[spoiler:the enchanted Sword that Sings that's ''supposed'' to choose the king has been missing for a generation.]] If the protagonists can [[spoiler:find the sword in time, and it does indeed choose the younger brother]], then the rebellion will have morality ''and'' legality on its side.
* Damadora in the Literature/BelisariusSeries.
* In Susan Dexter's ''The Wizard's Shadow'', it quickly becomes obvious that the regent uncle is a far better ruler than his nephew the king -- and far too conscientious to do anything but step aside when his nephew is old enough.
* ''ASongOfIceAndFire'':
** Robert's rebellion against King Aerys Targaryen: no question Aerys is the rightful king, but he also has this nasty habit of burning people alive. This ''would'' have been averted in the case of his eldest son Rhaegar, [[GenerationXerox "his father's son"]] in many unfortunate ways.
**.
** Tyrion Lannister spends much of the second book trying to make the kingdom a better place despite Joffrey. PragmaticEvil [[IDidWhatIHadToDo to sacrifice all and everything in Westeros to make sure what he sees as "the right thing" happens]]. His rule would be inaugarated.
** In the backstory, the supporters of Daemon Blackfyre in the Blackfyre Rebellion saw King Daeron II ("Daeron the Good") as this. They were believers in AsskickingEqualsAuthority and preferred a warrior-king to the bookish Daeron.
* In the [[RealmOfTheElderlings Farseer trilogy]], Prince Regal declares the MIA Prince Verity dead in order to have legitimacy for his reign.
* ''TheWarlordChronicles'' by Creator/BernardCornwell has Arthur as King Uther's HeroicBastard son and Mordred as King Uther's legitimate but treacherous grandson. Unfortunately, Arthur is far too LawfulGood to make himself RegentForLife.
* In the VorkosiganSaga, Prince Serg, legitimate heir to the Barrayaran empire, is very much {{the Caligula}}. The succession issue is resolved when Serg is [[UriahGambit allowed to lead]] a [[CurbStompBattle.
* In ''[[TalesOfTheBranionRealm The Granite Shield]]'', the rulers of a fantasy England are entirely legitimate, but also apostates who deny their [[GodEmperor divine status]]. A vicious civil war develops when a RoyalBastard is born and raised in the proper faith.
* The Queen in Tanya Huff's ''A Woman's Work'' is well aware that her son is not up to her standards of Evil Overlordness and is a romantic idiot. After the conquest of a neighbouring kingdom, she notices that the youngest princess of the deposed royal family has a very ''practical'' frame of mind who quickly agrees to a marriage to the Queen's son, after having arranged for her two brothers to die in a failed suicide attack and her eldest sister to have unfortunately become deceased. Queen Arrabel cheerfully expects that her son will suffer a tragic accident very soon after their first child is born, making the daughter-in-law the new heir to the throne, and is quite pleased at the thought of having a competent successor. She's also quite careful not to eat any food given to her by her new daughter-in-law.
* In ''Literature/SummersAtCastleA sees the kingdom's downfall.

* ''Series/GameOfThrones'': [[ReasonableAuthorityFigure Renly]] invokes this trope when trying to convince [[spoiler: [[HonorBeforeReason Ned Stark]] to support his coup for the throne]], pointing out that he's the most qualified heir for the job.
** Viserys Targaryen also proves to be that: After his father was killed for being TheCaligula, he became obsessed with getting his crown back at any cost.
** Joffrey is also an example, of a sort: his mother, Queen Cersei, is his regent, and she is a [[GodSaveUsFromTheQueen bad ruler]], but still better than Joffrey. A subversion, however, because Joffrey is also not the rightful king himself, although he doesn't know it.
* Korean HistoricalDrama ''[[ ''him' ''Series/ThePalace'', though only in a potential sense. In Episode 8, [[ManipulativeBitch Princess Eleanor]] starts a rumour about King Richard's possible illegitimacy so that he will be forced to take a paternity test before his coronation.

* In ''{{Exalted}}'', the Realm is on the edge of civil war with the Scarlet Empress vanished. The Empress' eldest and most powerful child, Mnemon, ''would'' be a shoe-in for the throne (despite the fact that the Realm has no rules for succession; the Empress is supposed to be immortal), except for one thing: she's an absolute bitch at best, and AxCrazy at worst (DependingOnTheWriter). About the only thing the other factions can agree on is that Mnemon is ''not'' the one they want to take the Scarlet Throne, leading to it being occupied by an ''absolutely'' ineffectual Regent until someone decides to claim it for themselves.
* ''TabletopGameDamnHeroes moment.
[[AC:Theatre]]
* This is a very common trope in Shakespeare's history plays, especially the plays dealing with the rise and fall of the House of Lancaster.
** ''Theatre/RichardII'' was also this due to his capricious incompetence, and was eventually deposed by his cousin who would become ''HenryIV''.
** Averted in ''Theater/HenryIVPart1,'' and ''Theater/HenryIVPart2,'' Prince Hal (the Prince of Wales) hangs out with lowlifes and is complicit in a robbery later [[spoiler:defeats Henry "Hotspur" Percy who has rebelled against Henry IV in part 1]] In Part 2 he [[spoiler:reconciles with his dying father then arrests his former companions.]]
** Theater/HenryVIPart1'' Charles VII of France retakes his throne from the minor Henry VI with the help of Joan of Arc.
** Theater/HenryVIPart2" Richard, the Duke of York points out that Henry IV's claim was probably illegitimate, believes that he has a stronger claim to the throne, and conspires to rebel against King Henry. His son Edward completes the job in ''Theater/HenryVIPart3"
** 'Theatre/RichardIII'' used for usurping the throne from his nephew Edward V - the latter was a child and so unfit to rule. The real Richard also cast doubt on Edward's legitimacy.
[[AC:Video Games]]
* {{Exploited|Trope}} in ''VideoGame/LastScenario'', when EvilChancellor and {{Chessmaster}} Augustus arranged the inheritance of the throne by the capriciously cruel and terribly incompetent [[GodSaveUsFromTheQueen Princess Helga]]. He quickly usurped the throne by killing her and was quite popular with the people for a short while - until he was [[TheDogBitesBack killed]] by an own friend, whose life he ruined by [[UnwittingPawn manipulating him into]] killing the former emperor, Helga's father.
* [[spoiler:Subverted]] in the 10th ''FireEmblem''. After spending the first chapter getting the "legitimate" heir on the throne, he turns out (which should have been obvious from the start with his HorribleJudgeOfCharacter stats) to be horribly incompetent, and easily manipulated for the purpose of creating a world war [[spoiler]].
* In ''RuneScape'', a [[RightfulKingReturns returning rightful king]] has done some unpleasant things in his attempts to claim his birthright. The nature of these things suggests that he is perhaps not the most benevolent potential ruler.
* Played with in ''VideoGame/DragonAgeOrigins'', where [[spoiler:Alistair]], the resident HiddenBackupPrince,.
* ''KnightsOfTheOldRepublic'': Your crew has to sort out a crisis on Kashyyyk (the Wookiee homeworld). Turns out [[TheBigGuy Zaalbar]] is the younger son of the local chieftain Freyyr, exiled because he attacked his older brother Chuundar (and using his claws, a ''major'' taboo among Wookiees) after learning that Chuundar conspired with [[MegaCorp.
[[AC:Western Animation]]
* Earl of Lemongrab of ''WesternAnimation/AdventureTime''.
** To make it even worse, he doesn't even want the position. Only going along with it because he feels its his duty to do so.
* Done very interestingly in ''WesternAnimation/AvatarTheLastAirbender''; both of the siblings who are potential heirs to the throne of the Fire Nation believe the other to be this. Azula thinks Zuko shouldn't inherit because he's "weak" (read: sincerely believes in doing what is honorable and right, has a sense of mercy and compassion, and wants to end the century-long war and restore balance rather than TakeOverTheWorld by committing genocide on two civilisations). Zuko thinks Azula shouldn't inherit because she's an unstable sociopath.
* PlayedForLaughs in ''WesternAnimation/TheSimpsons'' episode "Simpsons Bible Stories." King David (played by Bart) is overthrown by "Goliath II" (Nelson) as [[YouKilledMyFather revenge for David killing his father]]. David eventually manages to reclaim his throne, but it turns out Goliath was a benevolent king who built libraries and hospitals. David is arrested and taken to prison.
[[AC:Real Life]]
* A RealLife example from English history would be [[TheHouseOfNormandy King Stephen]], who usurped the throne from his cousin Matilda, the rightful heir, because as a woman she was regarded as incompetent to rule by the standards of the time (the 1100s). ValuesDissonance, anyone?
** Considering the disastrous result-a 19-year CivilWar [[UsefulNotes/HenryTheSecond her son, Henry II]].
** In this case it was really probably more of a no-win situation, since even with the gender issue aside, neither Stephen nor Matilda were particularly nice people, nor did they really possess the temperament to make for particularly good rulers.
* As mentioned above, [[UsefulNotes/RichardIII King Richard III]] cast aspersions as to the qualifications of a young king to rule. Richard's motivation for claiming the throne remain in the dark to this day; was he simply a power-hungry tyrant, or had he simply grown to believe that only he could do the job? We may never know. Richard also) were favor of that particular line of succession. As things would have [[TheKingsSpeech a whole host of problems for Britain's new leader.]]
* [[DynastiesFromShangToQing The "mandate of heaven" ideology]] propagated by the second centrally-administered Empire to conquer and subjugate the Chinese nations (the Han Empire) stated that the realms they'd conquered had become corrupt and had so lost the favour of the spirits, it was by the spirits' will/with the spirits' blessings that the Han had conquered them, and that everyone should now be good Han citizens and pay their taxes and not revolt because that's what the spirits wanted them to do. Unfortunately the same argument was used ''against'' them later on when their empire was on the fritz, and has been used for and against a good dozen Empires which have ruled the region since. Dead and living Chinese historians alike are guilty of picking and choosing facts to 'make' the region's history fit this pattern, together with the usual insistence on terming each new Empire a 'dynasty' (to create the impression that 1) 'China' has always been a country and 2) it's always been culturally homogenous).
* Tsar Peter III of Russia was an idiot who was allowing the country to go to the crapper. His wife, their union an {{arranged marriage}} when he was younger, was Sophia, a German princess from a poor family, and she was a tad more competent and deposed him. She's better known today as UsefulNotes/CatherineTheGreat.
** Most of the stories about Peter's madness were in fact made up by Catherine's spin doctors, but the guy still managed to piss off many influential people in his empire, including the [[PraetorianGuard Life Guards]]. Maybe not an idiot or madman, but definitely not a competent, shrewd ruler.

With the release of My Beastly ABCs in December, Duncan Studio was able to reach a new audience by providing families worldwide with an interactive storybook app that contains captivating animation and striking artwork. The app has received glowing reviews from around the world and USA Today named it one of 2012’s top ten apps for children.
Like other animation studios not part of one of our fine entertainment conglomerates, Duncan is going the New Media route in its quest for cash flow. (Moonbot Studios is another startup doing similar things. Still another is SD Entertainment.)
The reality of today's animation business/marketplace? If you're not a large, vertically integrated entertainment company, you're going to find it tough to get enough work from larger entities to stay in business over long stretches of time. The days when an indie like Hanna-Barbera could own and create shows, then license them to broadcast networks, are long over.
Today's animation independents have to execute multi-pronged approaches to creating and selling animated product. They have to not only sub-contract from the Big Fish, but create internet product, create new media apps, and partner in foreign co-productions. The studios with the most innovative creative teams -- and that make a practice of thinking outside the box -- have the best shots at long-term success.
But it's Indie eat Indie. And the 21st-century marketplace is neither warm, nor fuzzy, nor forgiving.AT&T Supports a Star Studded, Rockstar Lineup at the 2014 Bonnaroo Music and Arts Festival
NASHVILLE, Tenn., June 11, 2014 — With more than 80,000 music fans expected to attend the 2014 Bonnaroo Music and Arts Festival, AT&T is deploying its own stellar network lineup that’s sure to please the crowds.
AT&T has installed two MegaCOWs (Cell Sites on Wheels), three COWs, six CARTs (Compact A/C Radio Telephone Sites) and four, five-beam antennas that will enhance its 4G LTE network already deployed in the Manchester area. Mobile cell sites, covering several musical stages, will provide additional wireless coverage and capacity ensuring that attendees are able to share their favorite festival moments from the 700-acre farm.
The two deployed MegaCOWs are equivalent to seven combined cell sites. Each MegaCOW will be equipped with two five multi-beam antennas, and each five-beam antenna will provide festival goers with as much as five times more network traffic capacity than a traditional, single-beam antenna.
“This music festival is one that is both locally and nationally recognized,” said Mayor Lonnie Norman, City of Manchester. “AT&T’s enhanced network connectivity and solar-assisted charging stations will enrich the overall Bonnaroo experience for attendees, so they can stay connected all weekend long.”
“We are appreciative of the network enhancements this year and look forward to another great year of partnership with AT&T,” said Chad Issaq, executive vice president of partnerships, of co-producer Superfly Presents.
AT&T’s network presence at Bonnaroo is just one example of how the carrier is connecting its customers across the state of Tennessee. AT&T has invested nearly $1.3 billion in its best-in-class wireless and wired networks in Tennessee between 2011 through 2013, driving a wide range of upgrades to enhance speed, reliability, coverage and performance for residents and business customers.
“Bonaroo has continued to thrive in Coffee County because festival goers are getting a one of a kind experience and today that includes being able to share the sights and sounds of Bonnaroo with their friends and family across the country and across the world,” said David Pennington, Mayor of Coffee County.
“Bonnaroo draws in more than 80,000, tweeting, making calls, and utilizing social media platforms with blazing fast 4G LTE speeds.”
In addition to enhanced mobile coverage at this year’s event, AT&T will provide solar-assisted device charging stations for mobile devices.
AT&T is also the exclusive sponsor of this year’s official Bonnaroo Festival mobile application. The app will keep attendees in-the-know on everything related to the festival. Offering a full scheduled list of performers and events; a detailed festival map with all stages, vendors, and retailers visible and a comprehensive collection of all important news stories, video updates, and social posts; fans will be able to navigate their way through Bonnaroo with ease.

Justin Bieber used his appearance on Saturday Night Live this past weekend to address publicly and apologize for his use of marijuana.
In a sketch in which he played the president of the Miley Cyrus fan club…Justin describes himself in the third person as a “douche” before touching on his notorious marijuana incident.
“I also heard he [me] got busted for smoking weed and he’s really sorry about it and people make mistakes and he’s never gonna do it again, ” he said in the sketch.
The pop star made headlines when pictures of him smoking a blunt with a friend at a party surfaced online…sparking accusations that Justin was setting a bad example for his youthful fan base.
In his own defense, Justin sent a message to his 32.7 million Twitter followers saying that he was still a kid and would make mistakes!
“Everyday growing and learning. Trying to be better. U get knocked down, u get up,” he wrote.
“I see all of u. I hear all of u. I never want to let any of you down. I love u. and thank u. #beliebers.”

Do you find a babysitter? Forfeit the theater experience and wait for the DVD?
I didn’t bring my son to his first movie until he was 3 years old, mostly because he was extra sensitive to loud noises and dark spaces. But a friend of mine — the mom blogger behind Nessa Knows Best — has never been afraid to bring her babies to the movie theater, even with two kids under 2 years old. So I asked her for her best tips on how you can bring your baby to see Monsters University.
Here are 10 tips on bringing a baby to the movie theater:
1. Plan ahead: Read reviews, watch the trailers, and ask other parents for their opinion before heading to the theater. (Pay special attention to the length.)
2. Time it right: Conflicting nap schedules could be an issue, so it’s important to know their schedule before buying movie tickets. It might be best to choose a time that’s in-between your toddler’s naps, yet during your baby’s nap. (And hopefully your baby will sleep right through it.)
3. Wear a carrier: Vanessa suggests wearing your littlest one in a baby carrier — freeing up your hands to help your toddler with popcorn, and hopefully encouraging your baby to snooze through the movie.
4. Get there early: Find your seats, take any necessary potty breaks, and get everyone situated before the movie actually starts.
5. Avoid 3D movies: Opt for the regular movie screening with the little ones.
6. Bring small cups or bowls for popcorn: Which will make snacking more manageable for your toddler — especially when/if your hands are full with your baby. You should also make sure your snacks are easily recognizable in the dark, which only helps minimize the fumbles and frustrations. (It’s all about the prepping.)
7. Ask for a booster seat: Most movie theaters have booster seats available, which will help prop up the littlest bodies and weigh down the fold-up seat.
8. Don’t go opening weekend: It’ll probably be too chaotic for a little baby.
9. Stick to kids’ movies: Where loud laughing and occasional disruptions are the norm.
10. Sit toward the exit — and be prepared to leave. Not all movie trips will be a success, but it’s certainly not something to avoid altogether. Especially with a movie as highly anticipated as Monsters University.The.)

interweber.tumblr.comIt was with some shock that I saw numerous Chappy residents had taken out a half-page ad in the August 15 Gazette entreating Comcast CEO Brian Roberts and President Obama to bring high-speed internet to their island. Clearly Chappy needs quality and fairly priced high speed internet, but it is a sad statement about the current state of the telecommunication choices facing many millions of Americans that Comcast is the only option. I have had countless experiences with Comcast in many different locations over many years and not one was positive. Comcast routinely has the lowest level of customer satisfaction among its competitors, of which there are very few.
Where I live (San Francisco) the word Comcast is usually preceded or followed by an unprintable word. I know of no other corporation that has done more to frustrate, anger, mistreat and overcharge its victims/customers while providing unreliable and often misrepresented service. A phone call between a Comcast employee and a customer airing on youtube is worth listening to. The amply compensated Mr. Roberts ($32 million in 2010) seems to care primarily about the expansion of his empire and increasing short-term profits. If Chappy residents succeed in getting Comcast to come over, my sympathies will be with them.

gold)
-- A 31% increase in proven and probable open pit reserves from 11.4 to
14.9 million ounces
-- A 16% increase in global measured and indicated mineral resources to
20.5 million ounces (inclusive of mineral reserves), and an additional
5.1 million ounces in the inferred category
-- Life of mine (LOM) increased to 21 years from 16 years at mill
throughput ranging from 55,000 to 61,000 tpd
-- Initiating economic studies to evaluate an increase in process plant
throughput
"This significant reserve increase
and the high potential of finding more ounces from additional drilling
support our organic growth strategy. The positive impact of the 2010 drilling
campaign extended the Detour Lake open pit further to the west. With 14.9
million ounces, the Detour Lake deposit remains Canada's largest pure gold
play and ranks fourth among the top ten largest gold reserves in North
America. The next step is to proceed with further economic studies to
maximize the economics of the project, including a potential expansion of the
processing plant if gold price exceeds US$1,000/oz at the start of
operations," said Gerald Panneton, President
and Chief Executive Officer.
"Detour Gold has started
infrastructure construction activities at site and will be in a position to
pour concrete for the processing plant by April 2011. During the construction
period (2011-12), there will be up to 1,000 people working at site. The
Detour Lake mine will make a significant contribution to the economy of
northern Ontario, and with gold production expected to commence in early
2013, Detour Lake will be among the largest gold operations in North
America."
Detour Lake Mineral Resources
The database for this update
incorporated new drilling data from the 2010 drilling campaign (98,934 metres of 107,000 metres) and
all the drilling data from the feasibility study for a total of 985,848 metres of drilling in 6,047 holes, of which 435,563 metres is from Detour Gold's drilling campaigns.
The Ordinary Kriging
(OK) block model used for the global mineral resources covers the area
between sections 17,000E and 20,600E, extending an additional 500 metres to the west from the feasibility study block
model. The following improvements were made to the Detour Lake block model:
(1) addition of one mineralized domain, (2) barren dykes modeled (forming
three new domains), (3) vertical extension of block size dimension increased
from 10 to 12 metres (i.e. 10 (E-W) x 5 (N-S) x 12
(vertical) metres, (4) search radius ellipse size
reduced by 5 metres in the vertical direction (i.e.
from 50x30x10 metres to 50x25x10 metres), and (5) maximum search radius reduced along
strike for the inferred category from 200 to 150 metres
(i.e. 150x150x60 metres). The table below
summarizes the global mineral resources at various cut-off grades.

Detour Lake Mineral Reserves
The open pit mineral reserves were
estimated within a detailed engineered pit design by using the measured and
indicated resources at a cut-off grade of 0.5 g/t. In the pit design,
inter-ramp pit slopes vary from 49 to 56 degrees depending on rock type and
structure orientation. The block model was prepared in MineSight
with the kriged block grades that include an
estimated dilution of 11.7%. The estimated proven and probable reserves total
14.9 million ounces, after using a 95% mining recovery rate and an additional
mining dilution of 3.8%. The stripping ratio (waste to ore) has increased to
3.9 from 3.3 as a result of a greater quantity of waste (including inferred
resources) contained within the new pit design due to insufficient drilling
at the west end of the pit. In all drilling programs to date, the Company has
had a very high success rate in converting inferred resources to the measured
and indicated categories (and reducing strip ratio). It is anticipated that
the 2011 drilling program will be as successful in proving the continuity of
the gold mineralization, resulting in a conversion to mineral reserves and a
lower strip ratio.
A summary table of the changes from the
feasibility study is shown below.

The Company's strategy remains, as per
the feasibility study, to develop the mining schedule using an elevated
cut-off grade through the early years for a higher head grade to be processed
at the plant facility.
Capital Costs Status
Pre-production capital costs remain in
line with the feasibility study. The Company has entered into commitments for
approximately C$540 million for the project and has spent approximately C$80
million as of December 31, 2010. The current cash position of the Company is
approximately C$970 million, which is sufficient to advance the development
of the project through mid-2012. Construction progress remains on schedule
and on budget at this time.
Economic Studies to Start
With a solid reserve base of nearly 15
million ounces, Detour Gold is moving ahead with initiating further economic
studies to assess the potential for increasing the annual production profile
once the project has reached production in early 2013. The main opportunities
to be potentially realized are:
-- An increase in mill capacity (processing plant expansion) - initiating a
tonnage rationalization study to evaluate throughput options between
75,000 and 100,000 tpd (note that the purchased gyratory crusher is
already designed for higher capacity);
-- At US$1,000/oz or above and once the plant expansion is completed, the
Company could mine economically at a lower gold cut-off grade and
generate higher mineral reserves;
-- Engineering work optimization (i.e. pit slope improvements, potential
in-pit dumping of additional waste and tailings);
-- Additional drilling to convert inferred resources into measured and
indicated resources in the current pit to reduce strip ratio; and
-- Continue drilling campaign to test the western extension of the deposit
(i.e. 50,000 metres planned in 2011).
For a potential expansion to proceed, the Company may be required to obtain additional
authorizations or permits beyond those currently received or being sought to
accommodate for a larger open pit operation.

The amazing thing will happen, and you will carry on doing whatever you were doing before.
It's not just the most amazing thing mankind has done. It's the most amazing thing, so far as we know, that has ever happened. Better than a Mayor on a zipwire, better than a Queen parachuting into the Olympics, better even than a man with no legs climbing a flagpole.
We're leaving the solar system.
Go on, shrug. So what? We've been tinkering around in space for ages.
Except without you noticing it we've gone 11.2 billion miles from home using computers not very different to a ZX Spectrum. That's the same as travelling the 93 million miles between the Earth and the Sun 121 times, relying on the power of something less advanced than a modern digital watch.
There are two unmanned Voyager probes flying through space at 35,000mph, operating at temperatures so low they're 1/10,000th of those on Earth and surviving radiation doses 1,000 times worse than needed to kill you or I instantly.
They were launched in 1977 - confusingly Voyager 2 set off first - to have a peek at our nearest planets, which just happened to be lined up in a row so that it would take a minimum of power to use the gravitational pull of each to ping from one to the other.
They were only intended to last for five years but have worked seven times as long. They were going to look at just two planets, but NASA got some extra cash and the probes - by this point millions and millions of miles from Earth - were reprogrammed remotely via radio wave to go and look at the rest of the solar system as well.
(Think about that the next time the gonk from IT says it can't be fixed. He'll probably tell you deep space doesn't spill orange juice on the keyboard, but it's worth a try.)
The total cost of design, build, launch and 35 years of operation is £540m. It cost us 17 times more than that to put on the Olympics.
And what did we learn? Well, the big red splodge in the middle of Jupiter is a giant storm so huge Earth could fit inside it three times over. It has three moons we didn't know about, and one, called Europa, has a crust of water ice on its surface floating above an ocean 30 miles deep.
Jupiter also has a magnetic field which, when it passes over Io, strips it of heavy ions which create beautiful auroras more amazing than our own Northern Lights, and which generates 3million amperes of electricity - enough to boil 333,000 or so kettles with every pass.
One of Saturn's moons, Titan, has ethane oceans and loads of organic matter with an atmosphere just like Earth before life evolved. Uranus has a corkscrew-shaped magnetic field because it's on the yang after being knocked on its side somehow, and Neptune should have been named after Michael Fish rather than a god of the sea as it's the windiest place in the solar system, with gusts of 1,200mph.
The probes run on electricity produced by plutonium, and although it's about one-quarter the power needed to run the average American house, over time more of their equipment has been switched off to conserve it and keep the important bits going. Heaters, cameras and scientific instruments have been powered down and about all that's left is a gyro, an ultra-violet light meter and the digital tape recorder used to store data.
Yes, a tape recorder. Google it, kids.
This information is transmitted back to Earth in radio waves which take 17 hours to get here, and the signal is about 20billion times less powerful than your wristwatch.
One of the last pictures Voyager took is of Earth, from four billion miles away. We're that little speck in the right hand band of light.
It's more than twice as far away now, at the edge of our system where the solar winds have dropped to nothing and any day it will leave the protective bubble of charged particles called the heliosphere which covers our sun and all the planets which orbit it. We don't know quite when it will happen, because we haven't sent anything through this frontier before.
When the two Voyager probes pass out of the heliosphere they will be in the gap between stars - the interstellar medium. It is as different to our system as the Atlantic Ocean is to a paddling pool, filled with gas from the Big Bang, dust from smashed planets, stars dying and being reborn, and loads of stuff that is either spooky, scary or entirely unknown.
If ET finds them he's going to have a lot to wonder about, because on board is a gold record - we should be grateful it's not a TDK 60 I suppose, but do aliens prefer vinyl? - explaining a little about human life.
There are pictures of a foetus, a page from Newton, music by Bach and Beethoven. There are photographs of scientists and traffic jams, a handy map of the solar system and whereabouts in it we are, and people saying 'hello' in 55 languages including those now extinct.
There are beeps and clicks from human brain waves recorded while a lady read some philosophy aloud and thought about the man she was in love with, and handy instructions etched on the outside of how to use a stylus to play the record and what speed to do it at.
Once it passes into the turbulent unknown, Voyager has enough power for another eight years or so. Then the plutonium will be used up, and it will drift in the interstellar winds. Scientists reckon it will take about 40,000 years for it to reach the nearest planet, which of course might be inhabited by nothing but methane, bacteria or creatures who have evolved beyond CD players.
But there are two even more amazing things about all of this.
The first is that humans decided to do it at all - to see what is out there, for the hell of it, because it would be interesting, to wave at whoever might see, and just because. It's a lot more inspiring than going to Mars because it has minerals, or closing down bits of the space programme because it's all got too expensive.
We are leaving our own solar system with the technological equivalent of a piece of paper flicked by a rubber band, and whether it quietly disintegrates, sends us new things to amaze or is sucked into a black hole and made sentient by a race of robot beings so it tries to return home and destroy us all, it will always have been the most enlightening thing mankind ever did.
The second thing is that on that record are a series of grooves which, when played correctly by an alien who figures out how to do it and has recently found a hi-fi in some space junk and didn't know what it was for, will boom out Chuck Berry's Johnny B. Goode at full volume.
When summer's over, and you wave goodbye to the heroes of the Olympics and Paralympics while wondering what's left to feel good about, think about little green men bopping around to a 1958 twelve-bar blues riff in 'B' and know that you can be proud of yourselves for at least another 40,000 years or so.

I made a comment in a blog (of course) to answer a question but also gave info on resumes that hopefully will help people looking for a job! Hit send- nut ting!! Obviously, not set up to automatically accept comments! So, here's my comment in my own blog because, it worked for me!
_____________________________________
An ideal resume length is no more than one page in length- with a cover page, we're looking at about 2 pages! That means that some people will automatically have to leave off some of your previous employers- that's a given! This can cause problems too in that, there may be gaps between being employed and not- months in some cases! When asked, I always said that during those months looking for employment, I would explore the idea of self-employment! That was my lie! But, it showed that I wasn't just sitting on my ass, doing nothing- that I was active and using my head for something other than a portal for so much beer, during my unemployment days.
My last position I partially got because I realized that any personnel department is probably looking at 10s if not 100s of resumes each week. I would say that 99%, if not more, show up on their desks in white, 4" x 10" business envelopes! I'm thinking "all that white paper, folded up in 3 folds, has got to be hard on the eyes, all day long!" Has to be a better way!
I came up with the idea of using a 9" x 12" envelope that was a light gray, flecked paper stock with matching standard letter sized (8" x 11") resume stock!
This is the reasoning behind it: first- the resume paper being the same stock as the envelope, shows continuity! The light colored resume stock with black printing on it, is much easier on the eyes! The envelope itself, stands out against all of the boring same sized envelopes! It may be looked at quickly or set aside for a bit but certainly noticed by anyone having to look at resumes all day (first impression- just like meeting someone for the first time- because you are, in a way)! They open your resume and it slides out easily, lays flat and doesn't have to be unfolded to lay flat or be easily held in their hands- saves time! It also shows, you're organized too, among other qualities!
I used clear, press on labels, printed in my printer for the return and send to, addresses! White labels will work but contrasty and the idea was to be different! I know it worked because I got pulled in for an interview, got the job (after 3 fucking interviews over 3 days) and it changed my technical career! She told me that my resume stood out and was a deviance from the usual resumes, she had to look at all day!
So, that's it- long answer but is something to try! I sent out the usual resumes to other companies but for the one employer I really wanted- this is how I did it and it worked! Oh, if you're not sure what type of resume to send for a particular type of job, there are companies on the internet that specialize in writing resumes but there are others, that will allow you to pick the type of resume that is suitable for you in your line of work! There certainly are differences! Some companies will charge you to download an example, some won't! You should be able to import the example into your word processor and re-word it (but following the format) to suit your purposes!
Good luck on your job hunting!

An ideal resume length is no more than two pages in length
Excluding IT professionals, the resume should be one page unless you are mid-level manager or higher. You have eight to 15 seconds of the readers attention. Use this window to succinctly summarize what you offer in your opening.
I have a 16 page comprehensive resume guide that I assembled that I will be happy to share with anyone seeking a new job. Just send me an email address and I will forward it to you.
On the job search, the best Web search tool is indeed.com.
It is awesome. It works like a search engine in that you can enter your zip code and terms. It drills all the way through the job ads. The more terms you enter, the more precise the matches. For example, if you enter "accounting", "QuickBooks", it will only yield the optimal results that match.

It's imperative to make yourself stand out from the herd! Your selection of paper stock and label choices created the desired response from your potential employer. If you had used brilliant orange, it would have received attention, but the wrong kind.
I'm curious about your cover letter. When I apply for a position I always tailor the letter to the specific company and position using key words plus a statement that peaks their curiosity. It's worked every time.

- you're right, it shouldn't be 2 pages (resume itself) one page is preferable! That's info I learned at a resume writing service, years ago! How ever, important information may 'spill over' to a 2nd page and it doesn't necessarily have to
be
two full pages! My resume was 2½ pages,
including
my cover letter!
Also, if someone is already impressed with your resume because of it being 'different' from the get-go, I think they may tend to 'overlook' a half page, with a little more pertinent information to view! But, that's just a guess on my part! It worked for me and for them, obviously! Everyone is different, in how they handle their job!
Dione
- You're also right! My cover letter was definitely tailored to the major corporation (in my field)- to include the position I was applying for and some information indicating, I was knowledgeable about their company, their product's operating characteristics and even their product's model numbers.

“A lot of us have been involved in politics for a long time, maybe since Rockefeller, and it’s the first time that a Republican presidential candidate graced Harlem while running,” said the attendee. (Aside to readers: Can this possibly be true?)
Not that the black vote will be a massive factor in the Republican primary process, but the Sylvia’s appearance does provide a notable symbolic contrast with Rudy Giuliani’s appearance today at the almost exclusively white Harmonie Club.The most recent short interest data has been released by the NASDAQ for the 02, Nike (NKE) has taken over the position of #23 most shorted Dow component, from United Technologies Corp.

Virginia's old guard stood proud at this year's Governor's Cup awards ceremony, with familiar names dominating the “Governor's Case” of the state's 12 highest-scoring wines.
The Williamsburg Winery took top honors, winning the Governor's Cup for its 2010 Adagio, a Bordeaux-style blend of cabernet franc, merlot and petit verdot. The awards were announced Feb. 27 in Richmond by Gov. Terry McAuliffe.
The Governor's Case included six other Bordeaux blends, including the 2010 Octagon from Barboursville Vineyards. The 2009 Octagon won last year's Governor's Cup. The others were produced by Barren Ridge Vineyards, King Family Vineyards, North Gate Vineyard, Rockbridge Vineyard and Sunset Hills Vineyard. Two tannats — from Fabbioli Cellars and Horton Vineyards — made the top ranks, as did Barboursville's nebbiolo and malvaxia, a sweet dessert wine. The only dry white in the Governor's Case was a barrel-fermented chardonnay from Two Twisted Posts Winery, a Loudoun County newcomer scheduled to open to the public this spring.
This was the third year using the case format for the Governor's Cup, an annual competition started in the 1980s by the Virginia Wineries Association. The competition is administered by Jay Youmans, a master of wine and head of the Capital Wine School in the District of Columbia. The Governor's Case is designed to highlight not one but a dozen of the state's top wines, and the collection is sent each year to U.S. and British wine writers. It has helped spark a wave of favorable articles in food and wine publications about Virginia's rapidly improving wine industry.
Such competitions are controversial because several of the state's top wineries choose not to participate. Rather than look at medals and scores as indicators of the state's best wines, I prefer to regard the results as a snapshot of Virginia's wine industry at this point in time. This year's competition had 410 entries, all of which were evaluated by an initial panel of judges who selected 133 wines to proceed to the final round. Fifteen judges — sommeliers, retailers, distributors and writers, including myself — tasted the finalists over three days in early February to determine the winners. Twenty wines earned gold medals, with the top 12 scorers becoming the Governor's Case.
Barboursville's three wines in the case solidify that winery's status as Virginia's finest and most commercially successful, and they confirm Barboursville's Luca Paschina as the state's premier winemaker. Rockbridge's inclusion, for its 2008 DeChiel Reserve Meritage, is a well-deserved accolade for one of Virginia's older wineries that is often overshadowed by newer names.
But the Governor's Cup win is a real coup for the Williamsburg Winery, also one of the state's largest, and its winemaker, Matthew Meyer. A graduate of the oenology program at the University of California at Davis, Meyer came to Williamsburg in 2002 after working at several prestigious wineries in Napa Valley.
“My goal is to make a bold wine, yet retain the nuances of the Old World style,” Meyer wrote in an e-mail. “When blending any of my wines, I always think of three things: my wife, Elena; my late father; and food. If I can create a wine as beautiful as Elena, as complex as my father, and food friendly, then I am on the right track.” Meyer achieved that with the 2010 Adagio ($72 at the winery), which I described in my notes simply as “luscious.”
This year's results confirm that red blends are Virginia's strongest wines. Varietal cabernet sauvignon and merlot did not fare as well, though I thought the various flights of cabernet franc in the final round were quite strong. And I was particularly impressed with how many of my favorites were from the rain-drenched harvest of 2011. Their quality shows that Virginia winemakers are learning to cope with the most challenging conditions.
White wines once again got short shrift, with just two — the Two Twisted Posts chardonnay 2012 and Veritas Vineyard's 2012 viognier — earning gold medals. That's because the judging is done early in the year, when the 2012s are mostly sold out and the 2013s are not yet released. To be fair and representative, the VWA should hold the competition later in the year.
Meanwhile, I'm checking my calendar to plan visits to Williamsburg and Two Twisted Posts.
Inclusion of two award-winning tannats in this year's Virginia Governor's Cup Governor's Case suggests that the grape has a great future in the state, where vintners started planting it because tannat's strong tannins and deep red color could add heft to Virginia wines. Tannat is traditionally from Madiran, in southwestern France, and is also prominent in South America, where it yields pleasant reds from Uruguay and Brazil.

t2A federal appeals court has ruled bloggers and the public have the same First Amendment protections as journalists when sued for defamation: If the issue is of public concern, plaintiffs have to prove negligence to win damages.
The 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals on Friday ordered a new trial in a defamation lawsuit brought by an Oregon bankruptcy trustee against a Montana blogger who wrote online that the trustee mishandled a bankruptcy case.
The appeals court ruled that the trustee was not a public figure, but the issue was of public concern, so the negligence standard applied.
Gregg Leslie of the Reporters Committee for the Freedom of the Press says the ruling affirms what many have long argued: Standards set by a 1974 U.S. Supreme Court ruling apply to everyone, not just journalists.

I can also say, for example, that I believe Pakistan was funneling our own money back to Al Queada, and they probably even used some of it to build Bin Laden's retirement compound. They secretly welcomed him as a "War Hero," and our naive, incompetent political and military leaders fell for it the whole way.
Thankfully, somebody eventually caught on. They know this, and we know this, but for "PC" BS international relations reasons, our leaders still won't come out and say it like they should.
Or I can say that I believe the reason Obama doesn't approve the oil pipeline is because he doesn't want to have a backlash and be seen as the "Democrat who went against the environment," even though he wants the pipeline too; pass the buck to the next guy.
VENDItardEThe Bonnaroo Experience: Experimentation, Self-Discovery, Community
By: Already Alive / Michael Marantz (Director)
"People wanna interact on a higher level than they do in their daily lives," are words spoken by a Bonnaroo festival-goer and a sentiment shared by many who flock to the Tennessean campgrounds each year for the music and arts festival.
Through a montage of Bonnaroo’s many voices and images, this film sheds light on the festival’s many promises: the promise of experimentation, self-discovery, and love.
Discuss
This was so good.
I love how people attending the festival shared these personal stories. It captures the community really well. The blackboard wall "What I Want to Do Before I Die" hit me as the first impactful image of the video. Great work. Crawford, Director of Workplace Fairness, National Partnership for Women & Families
Fairness and equal opportunity are among our nation’s most basic values. They are especially critical in the workplace due to families’ increasing dependence on the wages of both men and women. That’s why Congress has passed landmark civil rights laws designed to protect workers’ right to hold jobs and provide for their families free from harmful discrimination. Yet, just last year, the United States Supreme Court eroded that right with its decision to deny more than one million women the ability to join together to challenge the discriminatory practices of the nation’s largest private employer. Fortunately, Congress now has the chance to undo the damage.
The Supreme Court’s decision in Wal-Mart v. Dukes was a devastating blow to the right of all workers to combat systemic discrimination in the workplace. In short, the Court said that Betty Dukes – a female greeter at Wal-Mart who received lower pay and fewer promotion opportunities than her male co-workers – could not join with other female Wal-Mart workers to hold the company accountable for unlawful widespread discrimination through a class action lawsuit. In doing so, the decision created significant barriers to justice for future victims of discrimination.
Now, workers who seek to challenge the widespread discriminatory practices of their employers must meet stringent new standards to show that their claims are similar enough to be joined together. This makes it more difficult for workers to challenge discrimination that occurs through the subjective judgments that often factor into personnel decisions. And it opens the door for companies to hide behind the existence of written nondiscrimination policies, despite evidence that discrimination exists in practice.
It should not be so difficult for workers who suffer discrimination to combat unlawful employer practices and have their day in court. The Equal Employment Opportunity Restoration Act of 2012, which was introduced today, would reverse the damage done by the Wal-Mart decision and restore the right of workers to join together to challenge systemic discrimination. It is critical legislation that would give workers who suffer from unlawful practices a fighting chance..

info@ACSLaw.orgAt present, we all realize that products that qualify as “green” are usually priced at a premium compared to “non-green” products. Logic would suggest that these higher-priced, eco-friendly products are most appealing to higher income consumers, but that’s not necessarily so. A recent study by the Atlanta-based strategy firm Miller Zell indicates that income doesn’t always indicate a bias toward green products; in fact, lower-income shoppers are most willing to pay a premium for products carrying a green label. Additionally, women are more likely than men to pay for such items. The study concluded that “offering green products and executing related promotions could potentially create positive dimension of brand or product perception, which impacts frequency and purchase behavior.”
Straight from the Report
“Results indicate that disposable income does not always influence the propensity to spend a premium on green products. Data also revealed that lower-income shoppers are more likely to pay a premium for green at a maximum threshold of 10 cents. Overall, women and Gen Y shoppers are more willing to pay extra to help create an eco-friendly environment.”
RFID Technology Tracks Perishables’ Stress
Researchers at the Syngenta Sensors University Innovation Center at the United Kingdom’s University of Manchester are working on integrating sensors with radio-frequency identification to track stress on perishables in real time, from the farm to retail. The economic motivation is the large amount of waste in the food supply chain that results in hidden costs passed on to consumers. Britain alone throws away almost $30 billion in foodstuffs annually.
Monitoring stress profiles will facilitate real-time inventory management based on shelf life on a box-by-box basis. Reducing overshipping and the amount of unfit produce that reaches shelves decreases transportation fuel, labor, shrink at retail and the amount of waste requiring disposal. Employing scientific data also reduces the “human factor” in making rejection decisions. The first generation of sensor tags will be silicon based and should be ready by the end of 2010. The next-generation technology, which should be finalized by 2015, will use plastic printed technology projected to cost about the same as today’s humble bar code.
Can “best if bought by” labeling based on the conditions endured by plants — and not just a projected finish date and shelf life — be far behind? Could the price a grower receives be impacted positively or negatively by the product’s projected shelf life?
“To Tweet, or Not to Tweet?”
One of the oldest adages in marketing is, “If the customers won’t come to you, you should go to them.” If you subscribe to this belief, then employing social networking must certainly be a part — probably a major one — of any marketer’s strategy in the coming years. Social media services are having a profound effect on how millions of consumers shop, obtain information and interact with one another. This can certainly affect (positively or negatively) how they view products and brands and how they make purchasing decisions. If you’re still not convinced of the value of social networking as a marketing tool, consider the following:
Facebook. More than 10,000 websites use Facebook Connect, a service that lets users log in to affiliated sites using their Facebook account information and share information from those sites with their Facebook friends. Facebook has more than 250 million members.
Twitter. Twitter users spend 66 percent more time on the Internet than their “non-tweeting” counterparts. Forty million members tweet daily.
LinkedIn. More than 12 million small-business professionals are members.
MySpace. More than 1 million small businesses and individuals promote their goods and services on MySpace.
Embracing digital tools to brand products, support customers and cash in on the social-media wave are some of the world’s biggest and best marketers like Ford, Chevron and Levi Strauss. In this digital age, consumers don’t search for products and services; products and services come to their attention via social media. And don’t fall into the trap believing that social networking is only for the under-18 crowd, which has little immediate purchasing power. While this group constitutes a large percentage of users, the fastest-growing demographic on Facebook is those 35 and older, who represent enormous purchasing power. A company or product’s best advocates are often satisfied customers. Companies such as Best Buy are building online communities where customers can freely evaluate and critique goods and services. A Nielsen survey of 25,000 consumers indicates that nine out of 10 consumers trust their peers more than marketers.
Generating sales isn’t the only use for social networking. Providing customer service and obtaining instant feedback are two of the fastest growing uses of social media. Comcast was the first to use Twitter to talk directly with customers. In use for almost a year, its Twitter account, @comcastcares, has more than 28,000 followers. Before, if you wanted customer feedback, you had to rely on third-party focus groups that could take months to establish and cost tens of thousands of dollars just to obtain customer reactions during a two-hour session. Now, with social media, there’s instant, 24/7 feedback from a breathing, living think tank of users.
Twitter, blogs and Facebook can also be a forum for top executives to offer candid views to consumers. Having executives and customers talk directly to each other eliminates the middle man and the possibility of meaningful information getting lost in translation. Consumers want honesty, and they want it quickly. With the potential for big rewards come big risks. The ability to reach out nimbly to millions of consumers who thrive in a 24-hour online environment requires courage, a change in thinking and most certainly an investment. Companies, like the general public, fall into two groups: those who understand and embrace social media and those who don’t understand, are intimidated by and eschew it. Most companies are still tied to a traditional marketing approach that uses TV, radio and print as advertising vehicles. It is atypical, avant-garde companies like Nike and Starbucks that have wholeheartedly embraced social media.
Social media should not be thought of as a messiah; it’s just one of the tools available to savvy marketers. Among men ages 18 to 34, 75 percent say they spend the majority of their time in front of a computer screen — just 18 percent say they park it in front of the TV. Can you afford to ignore millions of potential consumers who are devouring media in new ways? If you haven’t begun to develop a social media plan, you have no choice: It’s too risky not to. If you want to be successful, you must go where your customers are going.
Unusual Economics Call for Unusual Action
During tough economic times, business as usual doesn’t apply. Here’s a summary of advice from CEOs of Fortune 500 companies on stepping up as a leader.
Communication is imperative during difficult times. Communicate frequently and face to face rather than in memos or e-mails. Communicate the good and bad news. When bearing bad news, communicate why it is necessary and how the company and employees can benefit from it in the future. Communication is the most important element in maintaining morale, trust and respect.
Conserve cash as long as it doesn’t negatively impact market share or the customer experience. In tough times, these are some of the easiest areas to cut spending from. But don’t be tempted to undo what you spent years building. It will be more expensive and take longer the second time around.
Resist making acquisitions just because the price is cheap. This includes ALL capital expenditures. Make sure any purchases fit your strategic plan and aren’t just attractive financial opportunities. Major acquisitions should fit the mold of medium- to long-term value creation.
Leading a company through an unusual recession can certainly be challenging but also potentially rewarding, both professionally and personally. Maximizing every sale opportunity, “right-sizing” production and staff, eliminating unneeded costs and maintaining employee morale — all while providing superior customer service, order fulfillment and consumer satisfaction — can be a monumental task for even the most seasoned executive. And accomplishing these goals in the present while positioning your organization for future growth can be a Herculean undertaking. Taking a few cues from other experienced CEOs and managers is not a sign of weakness — it’s a sign of an intelligent manager who understands how to benefit from others’ experiences by modifying their actions to meet his or her organization’s unique needs. Here’s a summary of advice from CEOs of Fortune 500 companies on navigating these challenging times.
Reinvent yourself before you attempt to reinvent your company. If you’re a tenured manager, it is often difficult to objectively look at the business with a fresh pair of eyes. Fire yourself on Friday and arrive Monday as if a search firm put you there as a turnaround leader. Be objective, and don’t be afraid of bold change. A company culture that allows or induces mediocrity can’t foster greatness.
Prepare for a fundamental shift in how and why consumers make purchases. Motivation to spend disposable income is sure to change especially if your product is viewed as luxury, excessive or replaceable with a lower-cost item. Realize that the economy may not grow significantly for years.
Leaders and companies who are on the offensive will have a much better chance of surviving and even prospering in a down economy.

[4] Jongno-gu, Seoul, Cheongwadae Sarangchae used to be the official residence of the Chief Secretary to the President and any of the President’s work related to the duties as head of the executive branch took place there. Thus, access by the general public had been restricted. However, in February 1996, Cheongwadae Sarangchae was remodeled as the Hyoja-dong Reception Room to provide convenient services to the public. In 2010, the facility was renovated to include two above ground floors and one underground floor and was once again reopened as the Cheongwadae Sarangchae. In 2014, the area in front of the building was also renovated to include an artificial hill made of stone and about 150 or so types of indigenous wild flowers and grass.
Currently, the building houses a Korean Culture Exhibit Hall, Special Exhibit Hall, Souvenir Shop, Cheongwadae Hall, Haengboknuri Hall, and Korean Food Promotion Hall. Read on to learn more about Cheongwadae Sarangchae and what is has to offer guests interested in traditional Korean culture, craftworks, food, and hands-on programs.
The Korean Culture Exhibit Hall is on the first floor of the Cheongwadae Sarangchae and presents materials that give a glimpse into the lives of the Korean people. Mainly exhibiting the history and changes of Korean clothing, visitors can see exhibits of clothes and accessories worn by Koreans. The exhibits are divided by social class, so visitors can see what the royal family, nobles and commoners wore in the past. Next to the Korean Culture Exhibit Hall is the Special Exhibit Hall, which hosts a variety of exhibits. Currently, the “Wild flowers of Korea, from Mt. Baekdu to Mt. Halla” exhibit will run from May 27 to September 28, 2014.
The Haengboknuri Hall and Cheongwadae Hall on the second floor also house exhibition halls with materials on Korea’s past presidents and the future aspirations of the country. The Cheongwadae Hall presents the history of previous Korean Presidents through exhibitions of their keepsakes, a Gallery of the First Ladies, the heads of state visitor log, and the four seasons of Cheongwadae. Visitors can also see videos introducing the roles and duties of guards who are responsible for the President’s security as well as the security of international events held in Korea.
There are a number of hands-on zones and interactive photo and video exhibits inside the Cheongwadae Hall. Visitors can experience a variety of unique and fun multimedia exhibits, including a photo zone to take pictures with the current President, the Cheongwadae interactive cyber tour, the photo zone of the President’s office, and the Taekwondo experience screen. Next to the entrance on the first floor is a place where visitors can receive a souvenir stamp to commemorate their visit to Cheongwadae Sarangchae.
The Korean Food Promotion Hall organizes a Korean food making program for visitors. Visitors must make an e-mail reservation prior to visiting and the availability is on a first-come, first-served basis. Visitors can watch a demonstration on how dishes like bibimbap or japchae are made before trying the dishes themselves. The cooking class offers English, Japanese, or Chinese translation services and the facility uses multiple screens to show the entire cooking process. The participation fee is around 10,000 won per person and the dishes can vary by season.

"Defense Spending"
One of the most striking things about American politics, is that in the political plane money spent by the defense department just doesn’t count. It’s not thought of as money that needs to be paid for by higher taxes and it’s not thought of as money that needs to be paid for by reduced spending on other things. It’s just magical money such that as long as you keep the annual increases in the single digits, it materializes out of the ether.
In the real world, of course, it doesn’t work that way, but reality hardly matters in politics. To get new dollars spent on helping small children and their parents, you need to find offsets. To get new dollars spent on naval hardware, you merely need to show that the ship in question would have some conceivable use under some hypothetical scenario and will also provide jobs in X number of congressional districts. It’s a pretty screwed up situation. Which is all by way of saying you should ready Justin Logan on defense spending.Slide Contacts Review

When Slide Contacts is first opened, users must allow the app to access their contacts. Users can then start tapping on their favorite contacts if they desire or view all their contacts at once. Tap on any contact and slide to the right to call, slide to the left to send a text and slide way to the left to shoot a quick email. The plus button in the upper right corner makes it easy to add contacts, while the options button in the upper left corner allows users to organize their favorites, set up groups, change color themes and manage Settings.
In addition to the convenient swiping feature, Slide Contacts also has a speed dialer for call, texting, and emailing, a built-in address book manager, a way to sync contacts with iCloud automatically, and a Group text and email option. Furthermore, users can go into the Settings and turn on Call Prompt, sort all contacts by first name, opt to use WhatsApp instead of Messages, and turn on Google Maps to open addresses.
What I enjoyed the most about Slide Contacts is the easy-to-read interface and the ability to customize the look with various themes. The interface is sharp and clean and definitely has an edge over Apple’s native app. The downside is that after switching Call Prompt on to set the app to return to Slide after hanging up, it still went back to the native app. It’s kind of a pain to keep switching back and forth between the two. Additionally, it could use the options to check Voicemail and connect with friends via Facetime.
While Slide Contacts isn’t a complete replacement for iOS and isn't as convenient as Siri, it does provide users with a fun alternative. It gives the iPhone more personality and pizazz, and it makes the daunting task of quickly connecting with contacts a little bit easier. Since it comes in at less than one dollar, anyone interested in looking for an alternative Phone app should definitely explore this one.- About RIC

Bernard Madoff had a lot of clients with a lot of money. Over several decades he took in some $50 billion from his clients and told them he was making them money each and every month.
According to reports, the Madoff operation was only open to investors upon invitation. That is, he didn't have salesmen or brokers. He relied on existing investors at country clubs and in big business to tell their friends and clients about the regular-as-clockwork returns they were getting on their money which was invested with Madoff.
As with the best scams, the marks begged to be allowed in and Madoff, upon the recommendation of existing clients, would permit them to write him a check.
According to Forbes Magazine,
His firm was remarkable for returning consistent gains to investors for years, even in up and down markets, a fact that probably led investors to feel a false sense of security and enticed new investors into the fund...The Hutchinson TV stand for TVs up to 80” offers a warm yet modern design that goes well with many décor styles.

As a new parent I dreamed that our home would be the place where all the neighborhood kids or my kids’ friends would want to hang out. I wanted to be the mom that everyone liked and wished was their mom. I wanted all the kids to like coming to my home and wanted them to feel comfortable here. I hoped too that we’d have some neighbors that we were close to, that we liked and so on, and that the kids would drift from one house to the other to hang out.
Due to a bad thing that happened to me when I was 14 I would not have the home that let’s the young teens drink alcohol, have big parties, smoke cigarettes, smoke pot or use illegal drugs like popping pills. I want to make that clear. I won’t be ‘that type of parent’.
Now that my oldest son is 10 and we are homeschooling this is all a little different than I first imagined that parenthood would be. Due to the nature of this lifestyle we parents have a bit more control over who our children socialize with and which kids we choose to spend more time with and which we intentionally stay away from. With that said some of my children’s closest friends attend public or private school! We are not living in a little isolated bubble and networking socially with only homeschoolers. In fact the homeschoolers are actually busier than the schooled kids sometimes, so getting together with them is not so easy.
A few years ago a center was built in my little town that originally was supposed to be a place for the teens to hang out and be safe to socialize in. In reality it is more like a community center for the entire community (all ages) but they do have a teen area and teen nights.
Things are not as perfect, I don’t think, as the original elderly couple who thought up this idea and benefacted something like a million dollars to help build. One way the center makes money is off of after-school care for children living in dual income families.
I heard some pretty bad stories two years ago about the middle school students. Apparently in the after-school program the kids were going to the woods to smoke cigarettes, to smoke pot and/or to drink alcohol. Others were said to be having various forms of sex in the woods. They would then come back into the center where the care was supervised. This was finally addressed and the rule was made that once someone leaves the door they cannot come back in. I don’t know how this is working out or how they can prevent middle school aged children from leaving the building and just going outside to hang out until the parents show up after they are out of work.
My friend said she didn’t even like going there for the arts and sports classes after school as the middle school kids were cursing so much right at the doors and it was offensive to her. She didn’t want her young children learning new swear words from those kids.
Needless to say I have been thinking, “What kind of socialization will my kids have in their teen years?”
A couple of weeks ago, two families (whose kids are in the public middle school here) were telling me the big thing to do in town is for kids to hang out in a finished basement or in a bonus room of a family’s house. They sit on big couches and watch movies together. However they are drinking vodka in their water bottles, unbeknownst to some parents. Oops. Not so good, eh?
One parent said she is thinking of renovating a room in her house as she wants the kids in HER house for those gathering and she plans to not allow any alcohol drinking. She did also say that now that her daughter is in sixth grade that she is worrying already about making sure her daughter is hanging around with ‘the right’ kids.
More than one article has appeared in our town newspaper in which the police urge parents to not sponsor parties where alcohol is served. As a matter of fact the parents can now get arrested for allowing underage drinking to go on in their house.
My friend said at a PTA sponsored talk about children and drugs and alcohol a psychologist said that a family in town went so far as to grow their own pot for their teen to use. “They said they wanted their children to have a clean source.” The psychologist was not supporting that type of behavior. It was an example of the way some parents look at what their teens are doing and how they feel that using drugs or alcohol is not a problem.
I have no clue if our house will be the house that the kids want to hang out in. What I do know is that for now I am very happy that both of my children are very interested in Cub Scouts and looking forward to being in Boy Scouts. I would be overjoyed if they both spent at least one weekend a month camping with the Boy Scouts instead of partying in other teens’ basements. Go ahead; say my kids will be nerds. You know what? Having nerd or geek kids is actually sounding better than having my kids getting drunk or high with their friends on weekends.
I don’t think that the fact that we homeschool will be enough of a reason that my kids will not encounter any of this typical teen stuff. I can’t imagine how they could avoid all of it unless I carve out some tiny niche of ‘good kids’ for them to hang around with. I have doubts that it would work out entirely that way because the major problem right now even, is that all the kids are so busy with all of their different activities, sports and such and it is hard to just get them together in the first place.
Sometimes I think that parenting is difficult, at the stage we’re in right now. However when I think of the upcoming teen years I actually get a bit nervous and I think things will be even harder then.

I homeschool 2 teens and an 11yo and have done so for 9 years. Interestingly, they socialized with neighborhood and synagogue friends who were publicly and privately schooled when they were younger but now they socialize almost exclusively with other homeschooled teens. This is in part because they had a very active teen group as early and pre- teens that went to the movies at 2pm on Tuesday, etc. Also they just don't share the same interests as many of their schooled friends.
Problems with alcohol and drugs have been rarely, but not never, encountered in our group. My children do not go to the homes of certain families, do not spend the night in certain homes where I am not sure of adequate supervision.
When we have parties, I am in the background. NO ALCOHOL is allowed and they know I will be watching. Next time I may be a bit more sceptical of water bottles than I have been in the past.:) I think I would have noticed extensive sharing, however.
It is hard to parent teens but so worth it. I love my teens. They are very cool people. And they like me, too. You'll do fine.

I had similar visions to yours about ours being the house the kids came to and me being the sort of Jan Brady mom.
With my oldest it did not turn out that way because she ran track. I spent more time hanging out at track meets than she and her friends did at our house. She was not a party girl-type kid. She was schooled through high school, and she was considered a social butterfly at school. At home, she liked to be, well, at home. I did drive kids to track meets, and had a science fair project slumber party so that her group could record fluctations in the earth's magnetic field every hour over night, though.
With N. the vision is even further from where we are. First, he has AS and does not really enjoy socializing all that much. His social interactions occur mostly at Boy Scouts and religious school, Taekwando and such. Secondly, we live out in the mountains, and much of our "down" time is spent with each other. We enjoy that very much, but it is hardly the "teenage" activities I imagined from the maternal point of view.
We'll see how it goes, but since I got through the teen years with my older child sucessfully, albeit unconventionally, I am less worried about it.
>>>Having nerd or geek kids is actually sounding better than having my kids getting drunk or high with their friends on weekends. <<<
I am 100% certain if my children were in an institutional school setting they would be not be part of the 'in' crowd. GREAT! There are lots of cons to being in that world and pretty much no long term positives. As long as a child isn't socially inept, by the time they graduate from college you can't tell, or at least it doesn't matter one bit, who was "popular" and who wasn't.
My kids follow their interests and personal preferences based on what they like, not what their peers tell them to like. They haven't learned to be ashamed of who they are. They have friends, and don't only socialize with homeschoolers, but they have had so little exposure to 'group think' that they have remained pretty true to themselves and are now showing as they grow older an ability to handle what peer pressure they do face pretty easily and make good choices of who they look up to and who they seek out as friends. Contrary to popular belief, homeschooled kids don't 'freak out and go wild' when faced with 'the real world'.
And yes, Christine, parenting teens is hard but the rewards you reap are great. Bigger challenges equals a bigger sense of accomplishment when they are overcome.

This is indeed both true and awesome.
Unfortunately, there's still a month to go before we get the next issue, but the mini looks great so far!
Yeah, Geoff Johns brought him back running in a Kid Flash costume.
This is a great decision on the part of DC. If there can be be an army of GLs, I see no problem in having several speedsters.
I found out via facebook, facebook I tell you!
Right, i'm off to buy the mini this lunchtime.
And he's back as kid flash? that's far better than sombre adult bart.

But now Nicole Scherzinger has finally opened up about her relationship with British F1 race ace Lewis Hamilton, and bravely admits, “I still love him”.
Speaking for the first time about losing the man she wanted to have “beautiful angel babies” with after four years together last November, the emotions are clearly still raw.
“It’s all very recent,” she adds in a quiet voice. “And it’s hard for me to talk about it. But we are good friends. We’re great friends.”
Although Nicole is leaving the door open on her relationship status, feelings don’t disappear overnight.
Fans were hoping for a reconciliation between US X Factor judge Nicole, 33, and F1 star Lewis, 26, after they were pictured in an embrace just weeks after announcing their split in October.
The reasons given were transatlantic work schedules which kept them apart and the fact that Lewis wasn’t ready to settle down and start a family.
Work is now their priority. “Right now, he’s got to focus on his career and I’ve got to focus on mine,” says Nicole.
Lewis added, “Yeah, we’re friends and we can move forward. It’s never easy going through tough times. It’s these kind of times that are sent to try you.”
Not surprisingly, stunning Nicole isn’t short of admirers. She was recently linked to Brit rapper Tinie Tempah, but Nicole knocked back rumours that the couple hit it off when he performed on the US X Factor this month.
“We didn’t even meet backstage,” she says angrily. “It’s the most ridiculous thing that people are saying something went on. I’m not that kind of girl.”
There is one rapper she does have time for, though, and that’s 50 Cent, whom she collaborated with on her single Right There, released back in May.
“I was really happy to have him on the song,” says Nicole. “He made it sound like a classic.”
But it took some time for the pals to get their chemistry spot-on in the sizzling video. “There was one point when we were performing,” she explains, “and I went to go forward and we headbutted each other. We rolled about laughing.”
After a roller-coaster 2011, the new year will be about Nicole finally making time for herself and preparing for her first spectacular solo tour in the UK in February, and the US release of her debut album Killer Love.
“Next year I’ll work on me,” she admits. “It’s a new chapter. I’ve got a new journey I’m going on. It’s amazing. I feel it’s just the beginning.”
She is relishing the challenge of being a solo star on a par with contemporaries Katy Perry and Rihanna, and finally distinguishing herself from the Pussycat Dolls.
“I am so excited for the tour,” Nicole grins. “It will be based on Killer Love and there will be an acoustic element too. The album is special to me because it depicts raw emotions, and a side of me nobody knew. All everyone knew was the Pussycat Dolls.”
Indeed, Nicole is showing a deeper side, especially in her chart-topping track Don’t Hold Your Breath which is a far cry from the bubblegum pop of her Dolls days.
“The words to that are uplifting,” she agrees. “‘If you think I’m coming back, don’t hold your breath / What you did to me, boy I can’t forget’.
“I didn’t write it, but I always choose songs I can relate to. I share the same story as these women. A lot of songs are empowering because everybody who has been through a hard time in a relationship or in their lives can relate to it.”
This has been a milestone year in Nicole’s TV career after she was snapped up to replace Cheryl Cole as a judge on the US X Factor alongside Simon Cowell, LA Reid and Paula Abdul. It is a rewarding job and Nicole’s act Josh Krajcik has made tonight’s big final where he takes on Simon’s act, Melanie Amaro, and LA’s protégé, Chris Rene, for a $5m recording contract.
But there have been many challenges along the way. The feuds between the judges reached fever pitch and Nicole revealed that Simon didn’t speak to her for an entire week after she voted out his teen protégé Drew Ryniewicz.
More recently, Nic suffered a backlash after not saving Cowell’s other child star, Rachel Crow. “X Factor is a massive job, absolutely,” she says.
“But I had no idea how time consuming it would be. People don’t see the work we put into our contestants behind the scenes, and I’m so proud.
“The reason I wanted to be a judge is to mentor other artists and help to bring out the best in them. I also loved working with my contestants LeRoy Bell and Stacy Francis.”
But it’s not easy going up against Mr Nasty. “Paula and I stand up to Simon,” Nicole smiles. “I’m very passionate and I know a lot about this stuff.
"I put a lot of time and work into my contestants so sometimes, if I disagree with what he’s saying, I have to speak up and stand up for myself.
“He’s pretty upset with me, and with Paula, about Drew. He really believes in her and it was hard to watch her go home. But now he knows what it feels like for us. At the end of the day, only one person can win.”
But Cowell had better not freeze Nicole out for too long because Andrew Lloyd Webber has already come knocking. Nicole was thrilled to get her first opportunity to sing opera in front of him when he hand-picked her to perform Phantom Of The Opera at the Royal Variety Show in Manchester in front of Princess Anne earlier this month.
She flew into London for just 48 hours for the opportunity of a lifetime, after revealing it was her dream to work with the musical theatre impresario, and also had dinner with Lord Lloyd-Webber.
So it seems Nicole has plenty to look forward to in 2012. “X Factor next year?” she says. “Hopefully. We’ll see. I’d love to work with Andrew on a TV show. That would be awesome.
“Musical theatre is a huge passion of mine and he is the godfather of it. He practically invented it. Just to be able to work with him is such an honour.
“I got to perform Phantom for its 25th anniversary and it was a dream come true to perform for Andrew and the princess.”

Psalm's 127:1 a 17 years old girl and I've always had clear skin with the occasional hormonal pimple. A few months ago, I started to get really bad cystic acne on my cheeks and chin. I felt horrible and I didn't want to go outside. I didn't want to put make up in either because it just made my face look dry and horrible. I tried so many different face washes and lotions but nothing helped and some actually made me break out worse. I felt like nothing was helping. Then about a week ago I came across a video on YouTube about how Apple Cider Vinegar helped cute acne. So I thought why not give it a shot. I started using the CeraVe facial cleanser twice a day and then apply Heinz ACV all over my face. I also would drink about 2 tbs with a tiny bit of water after breakfast and dinner. I stopped using lotion because I have naturally combo/oily skin and I felt that it helped reduce break outs but maybe that's just me. After about a week, I saw a huge change in my skin. I didn't get any new break outs and my scars were starting to fade. Hopefully after a month or so my skin will be clearer. I think the 2nd main thing that really helped my acne to clear up is competely cutting out sugar from my diet.
I don't usually write reviews but I felt compelled to write this one. I'm a 28 year old (very active) male, who has been dealing with acne for the past 10 years straight. Recently, I've been dealing with big, cyst-like pimples that don't graduate to a whitehead and hang out for awhile. I have used everything to treat it, and have been to multiple dermatologists. Some of the remedies I have used/tried over the years include Accutane, antibiotics (a couple types), prescription topical treatments including creams and dabbers, oregano oil, Proactiv and all all of the over the counter products containing benzoyl peroxide and salicylic acid. The Accutane, and possibly the antibittics worked temporarily, but my skin would return to its tainted form. Everything else was almost pointless as my skin would adapt quickly and become resilient. My skin condition would also really affect my confidence unfortunately and would literally ruin my life. I didn't want it to own me mentally like it did, but I couldn't help it.
So, after years of trying all these things, and not wanting to take the antibiotics that my dermatologist said was the only option I had (medically), I came across people's YouTube videos and posts on this site about Apple Cider Vinegar (ACV). I had already tried other natural remedies like Oregano Oil after some people raved about it, but it rendered pointless for me. But, I thought I had nothing to lose, so I went out and bought the Bragg's brand ACV.
I started by taking one tablespoon orally; either mixed with water, or like a shot and chased it with water. I would also take it topically by using 50% water to 50% ACV and a cotton pad. I would let it sit on my face for 10-15 minutes before bed only. It would sometimes leave a red mark on my face but would go away eventually, definitely by the am. So, it has been almost two months now, and the results have been promising. I don't worry about acne anymore! I got one or two pimples on my face the day after or two days after starting (which were probably on their way anyway as I was going through a rough patch), but besides that the skin on my face is clear!
I will SOMETIMES get one on the back of my neck, or somewhere inconspicuous like my back or chest, but I don't worry too much about those as my face is really what I care about. They are also few and far between. They are probably due to the fact that since my skin has cleared up, I've been having more cheat meals; eating a ton of Ben and Jerry's and what have you (I need the calories).
I don't really know the reason for the success. I've read about how ACV balances your skins PH levels when taken topically. I also noticed when I used it topically on pimples I already had, they would shrink and/or come to a whitehead faster than normal. I also noticed that it helped with my digestion considerably. This led me to wonder if my acne was due to some stomach/digestion problems. This YouTube video sort of corroborates this possibility (https://[link removed] The only precautions I have would be when you drink it, it is probably preferred that you mix it with water. When you swallow, try to get it straight down your esophagus without having it splash around you mouth. Apparently it is not good for teeth enamel. When applying it to your face, absolutely dilute it at least 50/50 ACV to water. Then, if you want a stronger concentration of ACV later on you can add more, but I highly doubt you will need to. I've also read the importance of buying ACV that has the "mother" in it. Bragg's has been the most prominently suggested brand and I just buy it from Superstore (common grocery store).
Anyways, this stuff, for me, has been legit. I still use the exact treatment methods (one tablespoon orally/topically applied at night) as when I started. If you're reading this and you're having a rough go, I'm telling you it is definitely worth a chance. I bet you'll see results in the first 2 weeks but give it a solid month. Not having acne has changed my life. This may sound strange but I feel like I'm finally able to develop into myself. I know most people don't let acne bother them, but I had some bad breakouts, for a solid 10 years. Life isn't perfect, but not having to worry about acne is a huge blessing.
Ok, thats the end of my rant. All the best to everyone out there.
Wow, straight up its been like a month and i don’t even worry about waking up with acne anymore, not only this my skin is well balanced and i think over time i have found a miracle cure
Morning and night after shower i pour maybe 30 mls of my ACV mix – 30% ACV 70% water, into my hand and splash/rub it over my face.... FAST EASY and smell disipears after like 30 seconds
I also take 1 Tablespoon of ACV DILUTED!! in a BIG cup of water before breakfast and dinner
I don’t use facewash anymore, i don’t trust the dodgy chemicals in it. (well thats a lie, once a week i use a commercial facewash)
BEST SKIN EVER cost maybe $1 a week!! AND its natural
This stuff has changed my liiiiiifee, no joke. I'll spare you the 20 min intro where I talk about how long I've had acne, that I've tried everything under the sun, blah blah blah. All that's really important is that there comes a time where you are SICK of dealing with acne and are determined to find something that works. Low and behold, ACV! If you think your acne may be hormonal or diet related I highly suggest you try this.
I started drinking Bragg's ACV (diluted, of course - 1 tbs to a glass of water, 2x a day) a little over a month ago. The first couple weeks, I purged like crazy - it sucked. BUT - if you think about it, it makes perfect sense - ACV detoxifies your blood and organs so all the built up toxins inside your body have to come out somehow - i.e the skin, or waste (which I experienced as well, not fun). After the initial purging phase my skin began to clear, and I got that "glow" that everyone talks about. Don't get me wrong, I still breakout. But they are MUCH less frequent and smaller than what I was used to. The best part is, you know those tiny under the skin bumps which you try to pop and they would then turn into huge zits? I had a ton of those, especially along my jawline and cheeks - they are DISAPPEARING! Slowly, but surely - which gives me hope that in a couple more weeks my skin will be completely clear with no "hiding" acne :) I also started using this as a topical toner, but that will be another review!
Definitely recommend trying this AND sticking it out for at least a few weeks before you decide if it's for you.
One last note - I was initially drinking 2 tbs, 2x a day and I was getting pretty bad stomach pains. I cut down to 1 tbs/2x a day and all symptoms diminished :) play around a bit with the ratios and good luck!
I never usually write reviews however felt I should share my experience.
I was a fortunate teenager and didn't suffer with acne for a long period of time - maybe for a few months on 2 occasions during my teen years but it went away on its own and throughout my early 20s my skin was pretty good.
mid-twenties i started to get acne all around my jaw line and cheeks. it generally been fluctuating over the last 3 years and more recently became worse with a number of red papules and pustules.
I started using organic apple cider vinegar (braggs) 4 weeks ago - 1 tea spoon diluted in water morning and night, and one tea spoon with 4-5 teaspoons of water to apply topically on my skin twice a day. Ive also been using castor oil every day as a moisturiser for the last 2 weeks.
When initially using apple cider vinegar - i definately got some 'purging' - lots of new pustules over the first 10 days which were easy to pop and did not scar significantly. definatley has settled in the last 2 weeks.
Over the last 7 days, I can honestly say my skin hasnt looked this good in ages - i have no new spots, my scars are fading and i finally feel like i have a normal face again and can go out with only a thin layer of foundation to hide the scars.
I would definately recommend at least trying apple cider vinegar out and castor oil for moderate acne.
good luck all.
It's very effective though I need to suffer from "purging" days. Hehehe. It's all in the process after all. I've been using it for almost a month and I can clearly say that it helps. At first, it has this tingling or stinging sensation but it disappear afterwards. I use it as a regular toner at night and sometimes during the day, if I'll just stay at home. :) But when my menstruation week is about to come and/or about to end, 1-2 pimples will appear and I guess it's normal. I tried to drink a glass of water with 1-2 tbsp of ACV, but I didn't last long since I'm not used to the taste of it. But you can try it if you want. :) I feel refreshed whenever I use ACV as my toner. I even use yogurt with a mixture of 1 tbsp of honey and 1-2 tsp. of lemon (after I use ACV toner). I use it as a face mask and I'll leave it overnight. It works for me since yogurt mask also helps in healing pimple marks as well as dark spots. You can try to use my advice but I'know that it won't work for everyone. But you've got nothing to lose since I also experienced in having doubts if these stuffs will be helpful or not. Just try and even better, have a proper and balanced diet. I did not eat too much oily and fatty foods for a week, and honestly, I recognized that I didn't have any pimples for a week especially when I continue to use ACV and yogurt-honey-lemon mask :)
I'll continue doing this and maintain proper health. I hope my advice will somehow help you. :)
so im 17 and about 2 months ago cystic acne showed up covering my cheeks. nothing has worked my next go to was accutane but I decided to try acv before all those harmones. It's been 5 days and my cystic zits are starting to come to a yellow head and I think thats called purging I drink it twice a day and apply it as toner I hope it continues to work!
I've suddenly gotten moderate acne about 3 years ago (i was 22 at the time). I never understoond why this was happening but I think i've figured it out now.
I probably have a candida overgrowth in my body, which can cause acne (and a bunch of other symptoms like dandruf etc). I always thought candida was a genetal thing, but getting thrush is just one of the symptoms (that I'v luckily never experienced). I read that drinking ACV clears the yeast infection from your body so that's what I've been doing for over a week now. I can't tell you how excited I am! It works wonders, all the additional symptoms I had from the candida are getting less and less. My skin is now in the purging phase, which actually gives me hope that it's doing wonders. My skin has gotten better, apart from the few extra zits I've got from the purging.
I drink 2 shots a day, and apply topically only on the pimples. I havent been using it as a tonic since I'm convinced my acne has an internal source. I would recommend anyone on here, to check for other symptoms [link removed] because unexplained acne can mean you have a candida overgrowth just like 65% of America.
...I think acv has contributed to reducing the inflammation of my acne and helped with digestion discomfort, I will update this if it seems to be a placebo. I have been taking it for a week and a half...we shall see :) I take 1 tablespoon of acv with a cup of water most days. A few weeks ago I made a hair rinse with it, my hair was soooo shiney, I personally wouldn't recommend doing this too often particularly if you wash your hair every day, it may be to acidic and dry your hair out, I discovered that for myself, but I am going to do it once a month instead and see how I go :)
Update: I think this may be a good accompaniment to a balanced diet, but I am yet to find something natural that will balance out my hormones, definitely noticed an increase of inflammatory acne around my menstrual cycle (not due to acv, just an observation over the years).1 My soul gives glory to the Lord, all parts.
His arm of strength to all is near;
He scatters those who have proud hearts.
He casts the mighty from their throne
And raises those of low degree;
He feeds the hungry as his own,
The rich depart in poverty..A Look Back at the... Pioneer-Tribune Archives

In a study published in the June 13, 2008, issue of Immunity, Tufts researcher Stephen Bunnell, PhD, describes how cell surface receptors cooperate to generate immune responses in a process referred to as costimulation. To reveal how these receptors communicate, Bunnell, assistant professor of pathology at Tufts University School of Medicine and a member of the immunology program faculty at the Sackler School of Graduate Biomedical Sciences, formulated a fluorescent imaging technique that reveals the dynamic movements of proteins within living T cells.
T cells play an essential role 'talk' to one another," says Bunnell.
First author Ken Nguyen, a graduate student in immunology in Bunnell's laboratory, found that a particular integrin, VLA-4, influences how cellular structures known as SLP-76 microclusters move within the responding T cell. These structures, which were first discovered by Bunnell, are assembled by the antigen receptor and relay information that is," says Bunnell.
Actin filaments are a major component of the 'skeleton' that enables cells to move. In activated T cells, many actin filaments grow at one end and fall apart at the other. These actin filaments 'flow' away from the growing end, much like a treadmill. Nguyen and colleagues," says Bunnell.
"We have known for some time that integrin signaling and T cell costimulation contribute to autoimmunity. Bunnell's images allow us to see that these can be related phenomena: integrins sensitize the immune system to antigens," says Naomi Rosenberg, PhD, dean of the Sackler School of Graduate Biomedical Sciences and vice dean for research at Tufts University School of Medicine.
In previous research, integrins and antigen receptors were thought of," says Bunnell.
Bunnell's future research will examine how integrins alter the mechanical properties of activated T cells. By studying how integrins influence the SLP-76 complex, Bunnell will gain insights into the costimulatory processes that enable normal immune responses, and go awry in autoimmune diseases..MOFAS Resource Directory

Tonight, she is worried she will watch it burn.
VanArtsdalen is the co-owner of Designer Eyes, an eyewear business located near Franklin Avenue on the boardwalk in Seaside Heights. She opened the small business on July 4, months after Sandy destroyed her original store on the northern end of the boardwalk.
Late in the afternoon, all VanArtsdalen could do was watch as flames licked closer and closer to the small shop, as the leading edge of a massive fire that had already destroyed several city blocks spread further and further north.
“We lost our store completely on the north end of the boardwalk during Sandy so we opened this satellite location,” she said. “We’re trying to see if they’ll let us in to save our stuff.”
“We’re very worried and upset.”
Brett Tinstler, a Seaside Heights resident, did everything he could to prevent the fire from reaching his business, Sun King Beach Shop, located on the same block.
“In front of my store I’ve already had to put out two fires and that was an hour ago,” he said shortly before 6 p.m. “Then they made me stop and asked me to leave the boardwalk.”
Business owners like Tinstler were desperately seeking information from emergency officials as the fire raged, but the response he received only echoed the chaos of the situation.
“Right now they’re not able to tell me anything,” he said “They’re saying they’re not sure what is going to happen.”AFFIDAVIT

CHARLESTOWN water polo player Lucas Mackaway returned from the Pan Pacific Water Polo Youth Championships with silver.
The NSW Country under-16s team was defeated 7-5 by NSW City in New Zealand.
The Australian Born 98 Youth team, which Mackaway also represented, finished seventh out of 20 teams in the under-18s competition.
Australia played three test matches at the end of the tournament against New Zealand and won 3-0.
Mackaway was named Australia's most valuable player for the test series.RALEIGH, N.C. -- Panthers forward Evgeni Dadonov caused quite a stir this summer when he reportedly told a Russian media source that if he wasn't playing in the NHL this coming season, he would play in Europe.
Dadonov is currently in training camp with the Panthers and could indeed be sent back to Florida's AHL affiliate in Rochester, N.Y. The 21-year-old forward is having a strong preseason, however, and just might make the big squad.
Either way, Dadonov says he will do whatever the Panthers think is best.
“They were asking me what I was going to do,'' Dadonov said. “All I said was 'maybe Florida sends me back to Russia.' It's not my option. Whatever Florida tells me to do, I'll do. They say go back to Rochester, that's where I'll go. I'd like to be in Florida. I think I'm ready to play in the NHL, but as a forward, I have to score.''
Coach Pete DeBoer has been impressed with Dadonov's work this camp. During last week's rookie games against Nashville, Dadonov was Florida's best offensive threat.
In his first year in Rochester last season after playing three years in his native Russia, Dadonov scored 17 goals with 23 assists. The Panthers didn't call him up until late in the season and he only appeared in four games. Dadonov was held without a point in those four games.
“He's in that big mix and one thing he has is skill,'' said DeBoer. “He has a dynamic element to his game and I give him a lot of credit. He wasn't the best conditioned guy last year, but he's lost a lot of weight, a lot of baby fat. He's made a real statement to me real far that he's serious about being an NHL player. He's not a big guy but finds a way to get to the net.''
The Panthers like the way Dadonov plays. Not only is his offensive talent apparent, but he also plays a gritty game and isn't afraid to battle in the corner for pucks or drop back and play defense. It's a two-way game that may come into play when the Panthers are going through final cuts in the coming weeks.
''I think he's really developed his offensive game,'' Rochester coach Chuck Weber said. “He wants to be a pro here in North America. You see some mistakes, but his general game is impressive. He's going through the process, going up the ladder. He'll appreciate it when he makes it.''
CULLEN HURT
Mark Cullen's training camp ended before it started after he ruptured an Achilles heel during agility workouts during physicals last Friday morning. The Panthers hoped it was only an ankle injury, but Cullen underwent surgery on Tuesday at Doctors Hospital in Coral Gables.
Cullen, brother to Minnesota center Matt Cullen, was expected to start the season in Rochester although he was hoping to have a strong camp and be with the Panthers at the onset.
“I feel bad for the kid. We were looking forward to seeing him and he was looking forward to showing us his stuff,'' said DeBoer. “He trained all summer for this. It was a fluke thing.''
-- Carolina signed Mike Skinner, the seventh overall pick of the 2010 Draft, before Tuesday's game. The Panthers still need to sign 18-year-old defenseman Erik Gudbranson (third overall pick) if it wants to keep him around for a nine-game tryout this season.

As someone who works in a pharmacy I can tell you that prior authorizations are nothing new. The insurance company wants to make sure other alternatives have been tried first before paying for a new drug that is only brand name at the moment. Depending on the insurance company they will also require it for certain controlled substances or many other things. For example we have a patient whose insurance requires a PA for their Adderall because they're over the age of 18. Once PA is given it is only good for a year so you may need to get multiple ones for the same medication over and over.
In regards to generic vs. brand, every generic must be bioequivalent to the brand. If a generic exists a pharmacy is most likely going to dispense that unless the doctor or patient specifically requests the brand. This is due to the fact that the pharmacy will most likely get a larger profit percentage from the generic than the brand. It's also the law to do it this way in a few states.
In conclusion prior authorizations have nothing to do with Obama.
That's odd, but is wherever you work at contracted with either ins company?That's odd, but is wherever you work at contracted with either ins company?

I agree it's not all that common. I may send one or two PAs a day. However it's more than just brand names and expensive drugs. I just had to do one on generic Ambien and the cardholder had either UHC or BCBS. In fact I find most of the PAs I have to send are for generic mental health drugs (trazodone and ADHD meds probably being the most prevalent) along with brand name acne creams. I will say something that annoyed me the other day is when Medicaid completely paid for a 60 strip Suboxone script without even requiring a PA.
Opiods are for acute pain and should not be used for over 30 days.
And new chronic pain they should not be used for over 30 days while phasing in non opiod pain treatments

Pharmacist said this is happening a lot, insurance companies are trying to cut out the Higher Cost drugs... Thanks ##snipped##edit on Fri Jul 12 2013 by DontTreadOnMe because: Reaffirming Our Desire For Productive Political Debate (REVISED)

took a long time to recover but didnt cost me a penny or anything.
have been left with osteo arthritus and severe backache and i get strong painkillers for that which again costs me nothing.
cannot understand why such a nation like America cannot look after its own with free medical aid for everyone regardless of who they are..

I now go to a privately owned pharmacy that actually takes care of it's customers.
I was paying $600+ a month through wal-mart for my meds and I have good insurance.
I found another place.
My new pharmacist called my doctor and they did some swapping of meds. Then they got me some discount cards directly from the drug manufacturers.
Now I pay a total of 49 dollars a month. My meds work. I am using that extra 550 a month to cover some of my gas costs for the 16 hours of commuting I have to do for work now.
I wish they had generic gas.

Thomas Zacharia
Executive Vice President, Research and Development, Qatar Foundation
Supercomputing luminary and long-time Oakridge National Laboratory stalwart Dr. Thomas Zacharia has been a familiar face in HPC for the last 25-years where he’s been a key figure at ORNL, most recently as the deputy laboratory director. He’s recently made a jump to the Qatar Foundation, taking his wealth of knowledge and experience in a new direction.
“I chose to come here because I was convinced Qatar Foundation (QF) was committed to bringing about change for the country and its people,” he said in a recent Qatar Foundation Telegraph newsletter. “I also saw a passion to make that change real. When I look at any world-class research institution, I search for several key criteria – relevant challenges, adequate infrastructure, motivated people, and the leadership committed to making things happen.”
Zacharia explains that the foundation will be incredibly active in bringing their shared vision to fruition. “Unfortunately, [our] researchers do not have the kind of laboratories needed to achieve the ambitious agenda of transforming Qatar from a hydrocarbon economy to a more diversified economy for the future,” he explained. “That’s why we’re building a 200,000 square meter world-class Research and Development complex, at present the right size for our ambition.”
According to Zacharia, the first 40,000 sqm building is expected to open in the next few months adjacent to the Science & Technology Park (QSTP).
Zacharia says that their goal is to emulate major research centers like Berkely, Stanford, and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology – having a world class research university surrounded by equally world-class research facilities filled with bright young students.
“As part of this goal, one of QSTP’s primary objectives is to incubate new companies based on innovative technologies,” said Zacharia. “Ideally, these would be spin-off technologies from our institutes that in turn help small to medium-sized enterprises commercialize research.”
“My expectations for QF R&D are high, and we are still in the early stages,” he says. “In research as in sports, my view is that we shouldn’t brag about our scores in the first quarter. We must let the game play out. I am confident, however, that it is within our reach in five years to have a world-leading research enterprise in Qatar.”
With big goals in mind that will impact the future of Qatar, and perhaps the world, Zacharia is definitely a person to watch in 2014.About Me | About My BlogRSS May 11 2012 at 08:45 Pass the toke... er, torch! On Sky News yesterday morning, presenter Eammon Holmes was told that Lord Seb Coe, head of the London Olympics, would be bringing the Olympic flame back to London on board a plane. “I thought you weren’t allowed to take lighters on planes,” he smiled. You aren’t, Eammon. Nor are you allowed to take sharp objects and the London torch, which has already been christened the “cheese grater” by the Poms, looks like it could do a nasty injury to piece of cheddar. You also cannot take more than 100mm of fluid on board, and the torch is going to need a lot of juice to keep it going, particularly after the designer admitted last year they had failed in their attempts to make it as green and energy efficient as possible. Instead of elephant grass fuel the London torch will run on a mixture of butane and propane gas, which means it is fuelled by both the stuff you light your fags with and the stuff you cook with. For £199 (just over two grand) those taking part in the relay can purchase the torch they run with and take them home. There has been some controversy over this as the torch costs £495 to make, and some of the relay participants think they should have it for free. What are the odds that then 8 000 people who will take part in the torch relay (which is 8 000km long for a torch with exactly 8 000 holes in it), will take it home and when they first get three sheets to the wind, use it as a ciggy lighter? A plumber Pierre Bouchard used his cigarette lighter to keep the flame burning at the 1976 Games in Montreal. A cloud burst put the Olympic flame out. What with it being a day off, there was no one in the stadium save for Bouchard and a few other workers. In an attempt to save Canada’s pride, Bouchard sprinted up the steps and flicked his Bic. He lit some pieces of newspaper and used them to get it going again. Olympic officials were horrified and put out the makeshift flame, re-igniting from back-up torches. The torch won the top prize in “Design of the Year 2012” last month, reported Bloomberg, beating off, er, Kate Middleton’s wedding dress, an opera house in China, and Vivienne Westwood handbags made in Kenya. Shortly before the flame was lit at the Athens Olympics, a friend, Emily van de Pol, SMSed from London to ask how they were going to “fire up that huge joint”. The 2004 Olympic Flame did indeed look like a well-rolled three-blader. The Greeks solved the problem by flipping it over, to the cauldron, skyfing up, before flicking it upwards again. From what I remember of those Olympics, Greeks walked around with happy, beatific smiles all the time. When they came down, they realised they had to pay for the drug of the Olympics. They stillIn Memory of
Joseph J. Maffucci Sr.
June 17, 1921 - January 22, 2013
Joseph J. Maffucci, 91, of Wall, passed away on Tuesday, January 22, 2013 at Ocean Medical Center in Brick, NJ. Born in Montclair, NJ, he lived most of his life in Pt. Pleasant before moving to Wall in 1992.

Day 7 - Took the kids out in search of some Christmas lights. Didn't think we would spot angry birds !!
First page. Used one of Ali Edwards templates. I did a hybrid page again. Cutting out the top scalloped part and placing it on the photo. The added the metal 7.
I added an extra page today. The first one was journaling about our adventure.Used one of the 4x6 cards that come on a 12x12 sheet from Simple Stories and then added the border sticker and the journaling square.
The other side looked like this already so I thought I would add some things that we would like to do this Christmas.
The second page. I used one of Ali Edwards December Daily template.
Day 8
This day was all about the jolly man in red. Santa. We went to a friends Christmas party and the kids were surprised to find Santa there when we arrived. Turned the pictures black and white and very pleased with how they turned out. First I had them in color but there was too much going on that black and white was the perfect choice. I think these might be my favorites so far. Oh and Noah did not want to have anything to do with Santa Claus.
Did another hybrid page. I know big shocker ! I am sure that this will be a trend until the end of the album.
The second page
Still behind in my December Daily album. Have had sick kids the past two days. But I did manage to finish another week in my PL album ! So I will share that tomorrow.

Unlike some compact system cameras (CSCs) the Canon EOS M has an APS-C (22.3×14.9mm) format sensor. In fact it has the same large 18Mp CMOS sensor and DIGIC 5 processor as the Canon EOS Rebel T4i / 650D, so in theory at least it could be capable of matching one of the new Canon DSLRs for image quality.
But as Canon’s first CSC gets a new mount and lens it’s not a given, so we’ve been testing the Canon EOS M vs T4i / 650D side by side to see how they compare.
Because it’s a compact system camera the EOS M doesn’t have a mirror or an optical viewfinder and, as Canon hasn’t given it an electrical viewfinder, images must be composed on the LCD screen.
Consequently, in a Canon EOS M vs T4i comparison, the M replicates many of the features that the Rebel T4i has in Live View mode, including the 31-point Hybrid AF system that was debuted by the Canon T4i.
This system is intended to combine the speed of phase detection with the accuracy of contrast detection AF.
The screen is also the same 3-inch 1,040K-dot touch-sensitive device as is found on the T4i, but it’s fixed rather than mounted on an articulating hinge.
This means that when composing photos on the Canon EOS M vs the T4i / 650D, it’s not quite so easy with the M at awkward angles – low down close-ups or shooting held high over people’s heads – as it is with the T4i.
Canon EOS M vs T4i / 650D: spec sheets compared
Want to know how the Canon EOS M specs compare vs the T4i / 650D? We put together this handy cheat sheet which shows both Canon cameras’ specs in a format that makes it easy to compare the EOS M vs T4i.

99 common photography problems (and how to solve them)When considering tablets, most people consider 7-inch or 10-inch models. No one in their right mind would think about using a 65-inch tablet, but the folks at Ardic Technologies in Istanbul have come up with one.
While this isn’t the first time we’ve seen a big screen multitouch interface, what makes this one unusual is that it uses the standard Android tablet interface. This prototype allows Ardic to showcase the tablet user experience.
I think we’d all like our handsets and tablets to grow to this size and then shrink back into our pockets and bags. While the tablet isn’t that useful for everyday users, it will make an effective presentation tool, kind of like a Microsoft Surface table. Hopefully, the Ardic giant tablet will probably be cheaper than a Surface table, because we all secretely want one.

Stock enough food for your homes, says First Lady
Posted Sunday, June 8 2014 at 01:00
Ibanda.
The First Lady and minister for Karamoja Affairs, Ms Janet Museveni, has called for a return to the traditional practices which ensured food security in homes in the past.
Speaking at the belated Women’s Day celebrations at Nyabuhikye prison grounds in Ibanda District on Friday, Ms Museveni said the cultural standards in the past emphasised families to plan, grow and store enough food that would sustain them to the next harvesting season.
She challenged the residents, especially women, to store enough food for their families before considering selling it for other needs.
Ms Museveni also expressed concern that in most families, members do not plan together on what to grow. She said this role is left to women alone.
She castigated the youth who have neglected work and instead devoted most of their time to leisure activities such as playing pool table.REALTOR® University Speaker Series: Cities & Suburbs Now and in the Future: Full Video

The committee has met twice this July via telephone conferences. An updated logo, scripts for three public service announcements and press releases have been discussed. All these items will be combined to create a new WYLD marketing packet for libraries throughout the state.
New WEB2 slogans are:
WYLD Marketing Committee members include: Patty Myers, director at Platte County Public Library System, and smaller public library representative for the WYLD Network Governing Board; June Cleveland, technical services manager at Fremont County Library System; Diana Oedekoven, adult services supervisor at Sheridan County Fulmer Public Library; Julie Hurd, public relations specialist at Laramie County Library System; Linn Rounds, public programs, publications and marketing manager and Lesley Collins, public information specialist both of the State Library.
Mueller is retired from the Wyoming Department of Education. He is also a member of the Laramie County Historical Society, Laramie County Farm Bureau, and a life member of the Wyoming Alumni Association and Sigma Chi Fraternity. As new board chair, Mueller said his immediate plans are "processing, screening, and recommending a new State Librarian." His plans for the future he said are "securing funds for the continuation of our central system and WYLD (Wyoming Libraries Database) system."
Lovell Middle School Principal Anna Sapp is serving her second term with the WSL Board. She was a board member and former chair of the Park County Library.
A national survey of public library trustees conducted in the summer of 1997 offers some interesting perspectives on library leadership.
The majority of trustees (54%) have three years or less in their appointment. Seven is the most common size of board membership at 33% and five members is second at 17%.
Training in trusteeship was supplied by the local library in 66%, while 25% of the trustees said they received no training at all. Minority representation on boards was only 4.3% of the 762 respondents and women were 65% of those respondents. Forty percent of those surveyed did not work and the most common age ranges were 45-54 (27%) and 65-74 (25%).
The trustees indicated that they stay current on public library issues primarily through discussion with other board members (77%) , attending the state library association annual conference (20%), or reading the library journals such as Library Journal, Public Libraries, American Libraries, or Trustee Voice (the American Library Trustees Association newsletter).
This information is useful but the critical questions for trustees are: How effective are you in understanding issues and creating appropriate policies? Do you anticipate problems or issues rising and proactively plan policy? Do you communicate well with your director, commissioners and the community? Do you advocate for better libraries at the state and national levels?
Board development is an important element of our library community. If your board has a topic of interest or importance to you, please contact the State Library for development of a program for an upcoming board meeting.
Art Ellis heads the team that includes: Jack Mueller and Helen Fitch, representing the State Library Board; Marcia Wright, the WYLD Governing Board and Resource Sharing Council; Larry Stolz, state agencies; Brian Greene and Trish Palluck, the State Library; Charlene Paben and Helen Higby, public libraries; Sherie Monk, school libraries; and Carol Deering, academic libraries.
Sherie Monk, chair of the search team said, "This is a wonderful dedicated group of professionals to work with. We are all committed to finding the best person for the Wyoming State Librarian position."
Responsibilities of the team included defining requirements for the position vacancy announcement, and developing a questionnaire for applicants. The search team will also develop a time line for the search and selection process, create a list of interview questions, review applicant packets and compile a short list of the most promising applicants. Details regarding the interviewing and final selection of applicants have not been worked out yet.
At the suggestion of the search team a subcommitee was formed to get the announcement completed and released for advertising. The team includes Linn Rounds, Brian Greene, and Trish Palluck, all of the State Library. Advertising will include newspapers, library journals, web sites and key library list servs. A tool is also being used by the subcommitee to evaluate how applicants learned about the job opening.
On July 10 the vacancy announcement compiled by the search committee was approved by the Human Resource Division of A&I. The vacancy announcement states the position is open until filled, but eligible applicants are guaranteed consideration if they respond before the closing date of September 14.
The vacancy announcement is available on line at:
Judy Yeo, Library Development officer, is the Continuing Education Committee Chair for the MPLA.
Chris Vanburgh recently received an award from the Wyoming National Guard for her reference assistance.
Andrea Testi, economic and community development librarian, is the new Fremont County business councelor for the Small Business Development Council (SBDC). She will also remain on contract with the State Library.
WEB2, a web-browser interface specifically, will allow users access to information through a web environment. The old PAC system was text-based, but the new software is a multimedia environment including audio, video, and graphics.
Navigating through the new system will no longer require typing skills. Users will be able to easily navigate through databases and the World Wide Web with a mouse.
Access to a graphical web environment requires a greater bandwidth than the current system. Libraries are preparing for the upgrade by expanding memory capacity at individual PCs, and the State Library has directed an increase in bandwidth capacity between libraries.
With the new software libraries are bound to see an increase in computer use. Corky Walters, manager of the WYLD office, said because of the increased usage libraries might consider various PC-based devices, such as replacement mice, privacy screens, and filtering software.
Training will be provided for the new software by State Library personnel and external database vendors at various locations throughout the state.
Seminars for local public library trustees will also be offered late this summer or early fall. The training will provide guidelines to assist in the development of Internet policies.
A tentative schedule for the WEB2 upgrade has been released by the WYLD office. The State Library recently received the Server equipment on which WEB2 will be mounted so the schedule has been pushed back a month.
Despite the delay, the WYLD Network Committee has started WEB2 page designs that will be mounted for a trial period on selected WYLD library staff terminals later this. Comments and suggestions for redesign of the web page will follow the trial period.
WEB2 will be available for public use at several alpha site libraries early this fall. Corky Walters said she hopes to see WEB2 implemented statewide by the end of the year.
Installation of WEB2, a windows interface software upgrade, will require the implementation of a new telecommunications strategy.
With the upgrade and the anticipated implementation of TAOS, libraries will require greater telecommunications capacity.
Access to a graphical web environment requires a greater bandwidth than the current text-based system, and the State Library and State Telecommunications Division have arranged for the installation of T-1 Frame Relay circuits. Frame Relay will give the increased bandwidth needed for larger libraries in the system.
Along with greater capacity the frame relay circuits can easily carry more data traffic. Traditional digital circuits followed the state's backbone network, and were affected by other state traffic.
T-1 Frame Relay is only available in selected Wyoming cities which include: Cody, Powell, Jackson, Lander, Riverton, Rock Springs, Sheridan, Gillette, Casper and Laramie. Nearly all WYLD libraries will eventually need the bigger circuits and will be accommodated.
Oval Meier, former Wyoming State Library (WSL) board chair, was involved in a plane crash in Black Hills National Forest near Spearfish this July 1. Also involved in the crash was the pilot Donald Cluff.
Preliminary FAA reports indicate the engine of the plane was dead when the plane hit Green Mountain at 11 am.
Both men were taken to Rapid City Regional Hospital where Meier was treated for a chipped ankle bone, and Cluff was treated for a broken back.
The two men had taken off from Spearfish Airport in a 1961 Piper Colt two-seat plane and were headed to Cheyenne for a doctor's appointment. The plane cleared a power line, then hit tree tops about one-fourth mile to the west, Meier said. Meier then used his cell phone to report the accident to Lawrence County authorities.

A mini fair, "All About Diabetes," will launch the statewide celebration of the National Diabetes Education Program Awareness Campaign in Wyoming on Monday, Aug. 24. The Fair is from 10:30 a.m. to 2 p.m. and will be in the Herschler Gallery, located on the lower level between the Capitol and the Herschler Bldg.in Cheyenne.
Purpose of the fair is to bring attention to the burden of diabetes in Wyoming which results in an estimated $142 million annually. It affects approximately 23, 610 adults in state. There will be a short program at the fair which includes remarks by Gov. Geringer , Don Rolston and Dr. Eric Wedell. Blood glucose testing will be offered and a number of health care providers with be on hand to provide information.
This marks the official start of a year long program to increase awareness of diabetes in the state and additional programs will be promoted. During the past year Wyoming libraries have been participating in educating residents about the disease through a cooperative program which furnished current diabetes materials to more than 30 libraries. The Wyoming Public Health Association recognized the program at its annual meeting and the Centers for Disease Control nominated the program as a demonstration project. An abstract on the program will be presented at the American Public Health Association conference later this year.
Kaetz Beartusk, diabetes program manager at the Department of Health, coordinates the program and she worked with the State Library to order, distribute and promote the diabetes materials.

Nordstrom’s Anniversary Sale continues through this weekend, including this lovely knit dress from Calvin Klein. We love the royal blue color (it’s also available in a muted gray patterned print) — it’s bright, fun, yet professional. We’d wear it with a boyfriend cardigan (perhaps putting the belt on top of the sweater), or perhaps a long pendant necklace that hits above the belt. The dress is now $78 (from $118) and was available in plus size as well (though only 20W is left). Calvin Klein Belted Ponte Knit Dress
If you’ve recently seen a great work piece you’d like to recommend to the readers, please e-mail [email protected] with “TPS” in the subject line. Unless you ask otherwise, we’ll refer to you by your first initial.
That shape works PERFECTLY on me.
Found your blog via Working Girl. Am going to add you to my reader now!
beautiful, but only in a 12 and 14 now. BLAH. It looks like the patterned one is only available in petites! I really love this shape. Sad!
BUT, since I”m shopping….what do we think of THESE?
or
This is lovely, but only available in 12 and 14.
Just a heads up the Marshalls has been getting some great Calvin Klien dresses including the one featured. They usually sell them for $49.99 or $59.99.
If they don’t have your size online, you can call or go to any Nordstroms and ask them to find it for you at any of their stores. I think if you go to the store and they don’t have it, they will ship it for free also, but I’m not entirely sure of that.
I bought this dress – very comfortable and great fit!! Glad to see it on this site.
HK – I think the first one would be great but not at work – bright color + a couple of inches too short. I think you can get away with one or the other of those elements, but not both at once. Great summer dress outside of work, though. The second one works, though.
HK- I’m not into the first one at all, but maybe all it needs is a nice belt. It does seem a bit too short it may be fine on a non-model. I love the second one, though.
Love this dress. The color, the neck, the skirt. Does anyone know if ponte knit bags out in the behinder after a while?
HK: #1, nice dress but too short for most workplaces. #2, beautiful.
Love this dress, the color, and the fit. I’m a big fan of bright colors and I wish more women would wear them in the workplace. Black/gray/brown is so drab.
I just purchased this dress in black at TJ Maxx for $49.99. It’s nice thick stretchy material – doesn’t wrinkle and flattering fit. The blue is a bit bright for my taste….
Lovely vibrant blue. This dress would look great with black tights. You could even throw on a blazer to break up the color, but still display the interesting pleating at the neck.
I like the Donna Morgan Belted Ponte Knit Dress in the sidebar a bit better, actually. Love the neckline. Too bad both are sold out in my size!
Hah, I ordered this last week even before I saw it on Corporette! Hopefully it fits as well as you ladies say it does. I think it’s a great professional dress and will totally wear it with a black blazer or cardigan through the winter.
Love the Donna Morgan–so Mad Men!
Beautiful! Calvin Klein makes fantastic work dresses.
Kathryn–yes! I love wearing dresses that make me feel like Joan, even if I do lack her assets. Can’t wait for Season 3!
Yea, I was going to buy this one or the Donna Morgan one but they both say fitted through the hips…so I don’t think they will work for me since I am a bit pear. Beautiful dresses though!
Just marked down to $69!
I bought this when it got marked down to $69 and the full range of sizes was suddenly available online again. It came yesterday, and I tried it on this morning. LOVE it. There is some sort of magical quality to it that makes me look longer in the torso.
I bought this dress, in purple, from TJ Maxx for $49. It’s very nice but the belt is cheap. Will need to replace it already, and that’s just from trying it on.Select Other Language
One of my first memories is of my mom taking me to the local library in the summer. The children’s department had been changed to look like Ancient Egypt. I was captivated with the decorations, the crafts, and yes – the books. I was six years old, and was an excited learning sponge. Everything was new to me!
This summer, make the most of that feeling of excitement and love of playful learning by visiting your local public library. Many public libraries offer summer reading programs for many age groups. They may start their reading clubs at birth (as read-to-me clubs) and go all the way up to teens. Parents with young children can often keep track of the books they read to their child at home. They are able to enter book titles either online or on paper reading record cards when they visit the library each week. Child care providers might be able to work with their local community library by signing their children up for the local reading clubs. They can use the books read to children at the child care center to track for their weekly reading.
Need ideas for books to read and share? Try the following lists and resources from the Association of Library Service to Children (ALSC):
While many libraries work with local Head Start programs by offering story times on-site at the centers, it is a nice change of pace to see if your child care program can visit the library as well. Invite parents to attend with you. Ask them to drive their young children to and from the library and child care site, if needed. Ask the library ahead of time for information on how to sign up for library cards. Ask how old a child needs to be to apply for a card. Child care providers and parents can model wonderful habits for young children to learn at the library such as positive habits of borrowing books, treating them with care, and returning them to the library.
Public libraries often offer wonderful programs for young children and their caregivers during the year, especially in the summer. Look at your library’s website to see if they offer drop-in programs. Check to see if there are programs for children that parents or caregivers can attend with a few children at a time. Find out if you need to sign up ahead of time for craft activities or book-based programs. Another way to engage young children is to visit your public library as a community “space." Many have interesting children’s departments that offer far more than books! Puzzles, age-appropriate toys and age-appropriate technology are often available on the public floor for parents and child care providers to use with their young children. Creative play corners, once only found in preschool and kindergarten classrooms, are now making a solid comeback on the public floor space of libraries across the country.
If you are looking to match the experience of story time at home or at your child care center, ask your library if they offer story kits. Some libraries work with families and child care providers by putting together a theme of picture books to pass around in a backpack or canvas bag. These kits might have puppets, early learning activities, activity sheets to copy, nursery rhymes, and other resources.
They are a great way to introduce young children to the early learning best practices of talking, singing, playing, reading and writing. These best practices can be found in the Every Child Ready to Read program model developed by ALSC and the Public Library Association (PLA).
Libraries and child care centers are the perfect partners for early learning. They focus on working with the same age range of children, they have a desire to create life- long learners, and they are often important pieces of their larger local communities. So what are you waiting for? Book a trip to the library this summer with your young child, and open their eyes to a world filled with wonder, play, and books galore.
Happy Reading!

The program is being considered by the Environmental Protection Agency.
The program could be expanded to include drinking water for households with children, the EPA said in a statement.
Puppies who are born with microcephaly, a birth defect that causes babies to be smaller than normal, would be eligible for the program if the testing found high levels of microcephely contamination.
While the program could make it easier for people to get clean drinking water, the measure is likely to spark concern among the country’s largest pet owners.
In addition to concerns about the safety of children, dogs and cats are often the ones getting sick from the water.
“The potential is to have the potential to make it a lot harder for those with chronic illness to get adequate, safe drinking water,” said Tom Smith, a professor of public health at the University of Illinois at Chicago.
If the EPA approves the expansion, it will be the second time it has considered the program.
In 2008, the agency was considering whether to expand the program to cover drinking water.
The agency eventually decided not to because of the cost.
The EPA has been considering expanding the program for about a year, and is considering whether it should expand the testing to include dogs and cat owners, Smith said.
The plan is being held up for further study.
If approved, the program would cover drinking-water for people with a history of chronic illness, including cancer and other diseases, autism spectrum disorders, diabetes, asthma and kidney disease, among other conditions.
The EPA is looking at whether to include more people with chronic illnesses.
At least 10 states already have a program that lets pets and people with conditions like autism, epilepsy, Huntington’s disease, and chronic liver disease get clean, uncontaminated drinking water and have it tested.
In those states, the drinking water quality program is run by a different entity, the Department of Health and Human Services, and the dogs and pets get tested in their homes, Smith noted.snowman kisses printable

Keyshia Cole Is A Hater [#BIGDUMMYFILES]
I know tonight’s BIG DUMMY will probably have a lot of Keyshia Cole fans mad at me but hey what is new ? Keyshia Cole is tonight’s BIG DUMMY because she is a hater. Last night Keyshia Cole took her hate to twitter and picked the most unlikely victim to hate on. She picked the weakest link of Destiny’s Child to critique during the super bowl performance, Michelle Williams. Here is what Keyshia Cole tweeted to her 200k followers.
I think I was frightened to blink for a sec. Then Michell sung and woke my ass up from my daze! She always fuckN the groove up
— Keyshia Cole Gibson (@KeyshiaCole) February 4, 2013
This is pure HATE and many people picked up on this hate and started tweeting messages to Keyshia Cole and she responded by posting this follow up:
And yes my mom uses drugs yes it’s hard. Yes I’m from Oakland and made it damn far without influential biological parents!
—
This is why I think these tweets were based off of HATE. Keyshia Cole was probably at home watching the super bowl with ten bad kids running around, Frankie (her Mom), in the back acting crazy as usual. Keyshia probably thought to her self why am I sitting at home and Beyonce is doing big things at the superbowl and I’m not.
Keyshia knew she couldn’t say anything bad about Beyonce because everyone would pick that up as obvious hate, so she picked the weakest link Michelle Williams. Her rant had nothing to do with Michelle, we all know she is wack, her rant was about her not being happy with Keyshia Cole. Keyshia Cole will never be invited to perform at the super bowl and she knows it. Instead of just enjoying the show and accepting the fact she will never perform at the super bowl she had to ad some negativity to Beyonce’s show. Keyshia Cole knew the only reason Michelle was out there was because of Beyonce’. I’m sure Keyshia Cole was the last thing on Michelle Williams mind. Maybe one day Keyshia Cole can be Beyonce’s back up singer, since she chose to hate on her current back up singer Michelle Williams. Welcome Keyshia Cole the HATER to the BIG DUMMY FILES.
If your going to be a hater just accept what you are. It appears Keyshia Cole isn’t new to this hating thing, here is a throwback clip of her hating on other R&B singers.Joined: 20 September 2005

The Top 10 Ways to Succeed as a Working Attachment Parent
- Focus on the time you DO have together. Nothing is less attachment promoting than a moping mama who sulks about returning to work all evening long. I know from experience :)
- Dine together. Supper is a time to socialize, eat and share about the day’s happenings. Supper shouldn’t always involve the television. Also, supper doesn’t have to be a display of Food Network wonders either. I’m a big fan of freezer meals (prepped on the weekends) and quick dinners like grilled sandwiches, eggs scrambled with meat/veggies and pre-prepped meals from places like Costco and Trader Joe’s.
- Co-sleep. Co-sleeping is a way to connect. If we didn’t co-sleep I think I would feel terribly distant from my baby. At least at night I can snuggle her up, be available for dream nursing and whisper prayers over her as she sleeps.
- Make work, work for you. There is no easy way to be apart from a little one, but as parents we have a lot of control over many details. Can you work part-time or on an odd schedule like four, 10 hour days? Can you telecommute? Can your child visit during your lunch break to nurse?
- Breastfeed. It is not simple for a working mama to find time to pump, manage milk supply and do a ton of pump accessory dishes. But, the benefits are priceless. At night and in the morning (and during lunch if you are lucky) you have the chance to re-connect like no one else can. Emails cease to be important and projects take a pause when your little one latches on and looks up at you sweetly. Breastfeeding is a special connection that hours apart can’t break
- Know your care provider. Know them very well! You are trusting them with your most priceless treasure. Before our nanny joined our parenting team I asked her to read this book. It was important to me that she understood what we wanted to implement as parents.
- Learn how to “be there” when you aren’t. You know those super expensive Hallmark recordable books? Well, I splurged and bought one thinking my daughter might like to hear Mama and Daddy’s voice during the day. Guess what? She loves it! I also whipped up a cute picture book of family photos so she can “see” us throughout the day.
- Reserve weekends for family. It’s too easy to fill up the calendar with silly little things. But, trust me. Keep weekends for family. It’s your time to re-connect and re-energize.
- Find a support system. No one likes to do hard things alone. Being an attachment parent in the traditional workplace isn’t common. In fact, it’s hard. You’re going to be different and THAT’S OK! A support system – whether it be family, friends, La Leche meetings or an online community – is a must.
- Remember, your situation isn’t forever. Children grow up. People change jobs. Life evolves. Being a working parenting is an ever-changing situation. Things that seem impossible now will change in the future. Just take it one day at a time. Love your child the very best you can TODAY. Not tomorrow, leave tomorrow for … tomorrow. Obviously :)
What are some ways you have (or have seen others) succeed as a working attachment.

The Goal
All Alaskans become tobacco free.
Objective: To reduce disparities in tobacco use and secondhand smoke exposure.
There is great disparity in tobacco use among diverse Alaskan populations. For instance, Alaska Natives in general, use tobacco products at a much higher rate than Alaska’s population as a whole. Those living in rural areas of the state have a 36% smoking rate, well above the national rate of 20%, and double the smoking rate in urban areas like Anchorage. Men also smoke at a much higher rate than women. Tobacco use rates are also dramatically higher among low income populations in the state. These are just a few examples of populations at higher risk for tobacco use and tobacco-related health complications.
Current Focus
Promote culturally appropriate prevention and cessation protocols to increase the cultural competence of tobacco programs.
Why Are We Doing This?
Tobacco use is extremely harmful to human health. It is the leading cause of mortality and morbidity in the United States. And is directly responsible for approximately 30 percent of all cancer deaths, 21 percent of all coronary heart disease deaths, and 18 percent of all stroke deaths. The burden of tobacco is not equal. Data show that specific groups bear a greater impact from tobacco use.
- Race, SES, Gender, Age
Alaskan Adult Tobacco Use Disparities: Race, Socio-economic Standing, Gender and Age
- Smoking continues at an elevated rate among Alaska Native adults.
- Non-native adults with low educational attainment and income smoke at higher rates.
- Young adults 18-29 smoke at a higher rate.
- The number of Alaska men who smoke and use smokeless tobacco is on the rise — also likely attributable to industry marketing tactics.
- Race in Youth
Alaskan Youth Tobacco Use Disparities: Race
- Alaska Native high school students who smoke fell significantly from 62% in 1995 to 23% in 2009.
- In 2003, Alaska Native students were almost four times more likely to smoke than white students.
- In 2010, a disparity still exists, with Alaska Native students still twice as likely to smoke as their non-Native peers.
- Gender in Youth
Alaskan Youth Tobacco Use Disparities: Gender
- Alaskan males use tobacco significantly more than females.
- In Alaskan youth, there is a huge disparity between Alaska Native youth and their non-Native peers, a difference of 8% in boys and 13% in girls.
What We’re Doing
- LEAD Group (Leadership in Eliminating Alaska Disparities) work aligns with National DHHS Action Plan to Reduce Racial and Ethnic Health Disparities: A Nation Free of Disparities in Health and Health Care, which is part of a national strategy that includes increasing tobacco policies, quit line promotion, and cessation services in sites such as public housing, community health centers, substance abuse, mental health facilities and correctional facilities.
- The Leadership for Eliminating Alaskan Disparities workgroup and the Southeast Alaska Regional Health Consortium are working together to support local tribes in their efforts to create completely tobacco-free environments. Many tribes have already passed resolutions making their tribal workplaces completely smokefree or tobacco-free. If your local tribe is interested in passing a resolution of their own, sample smokefree and tobacco-free workplace resolutions are available for download.
- LGBT
One Alaska Quiltline campaign targets Alaska's LGBT community, who smoke at a rate double that of other Alaskans.
"We smoke twice as much as straight people."
- Hispanic
One Alaska Quitline campaign targets Hispanic Alaskans.
Translation:
Like father, like son.
Children living with parents who smoke are more likely to think that smoking is OK and they are more likely to become smokers themselves. Your children admire you.
Quit.
Do it for them. Do it for you.This photo was taken while Kristiana and I were doing one of the things we love most: sitting quietly in a coffee shop - in this case it was The Smelly Cat here in Charlotte - having something sweet to drink while writing sweet (or perhaps not-so-sweet) words in our journals.
One day last December, I decided to try taking a self-portrait in our bathroom, standing in front of the mirror above my sink. I took several shots and liked them all. This is my favorite.
The very next day, Kristiana took the camera into our bathroom, stood in front of Steve's sink, and took a few photos of herself. The amazing thing is that she didn't know I'd taken mine just the day before. I guess great minds do think alike.
This is a photo I took while on the trip to Sevilla last October. A gallery of open doorways beneath a small arena (think of the colosseum in Rome) caught my eye as we were making our way out of the little Roman-built village. I loved the interplay between the light and the shadows. What a telling metaphor for my life - Loving the light, but also longing to hide in the shadows so much of the time...
FYI - For those of you keeping score at home... For some reason that I cannot recall at the moment, I gave this photo the label "monastery gallery," but it is from the arena in a small village outside of Sevilla.

New York Int’l Auto Show
NEW YORK – General Motors is in good shape with its manufacturing footprint in the U.S., says Mark Reuss, president-North America, giving little indication the auto maker plans to reopen any idled facilities in the near future.
GM has two major assembly plants on standby in Janesville, WI, and Spring Hill, TN. Much of their tooling remains intact, giving the auto maker the option to bring them back online quickly if extra capacity is needed.
Sales are generally improving, too, leading to an uptick in production. According to Ward’s data, industry first-quarter output grew 15% in the U.S. from year-ago and 16% across North America.
GM’s production was up nearly 18% in the region, pushing its capacity utilization over 100%. Generally, auto makers want to build close to – or beyond – 100% capacity to maximize profitability. Some GM plants operate over that benchmark and some below, depending on the vehicles they build.
Reuss says he’s satisfied running at the current clip, even if it requires creative ways to satisfy demand on products such as the Chevrolet Equinox and GMC Terrain cross/utility vehicles.
To put more in the market, GM ships unfinished Equinox bodies from its Ingersoll, ON, Canada, assembly plant, which operates around the clock, to nearby Oshawa, ON, for final assembly.
“That’s the way we want to run the business, be very agile” he tells Ward’s after introducing the redesigned-for-’12 Chevy Malibu at the New York International Auto Show.
“We have large things happening in the world today and we’ve got some big things from a customer standpoint that can change, and trying to forecast that is very hard to do,” Reuss says, recalling the Japan crisis and rising fuel prices that can abruptly disrupt supply lines and alter consumer preferences.
“But what we can do, though, is have the capacity base and product-development portfolio that is agile enough to handle those things.”
Underscoring GM’s cautious approach, Ward’s forecasts GM will build at 118% of year-ago volumes during the second quarter, while industry output will drop from the first quarter due to parts shortages out of Japan.
Prior to bankruptcy, GM ran its plants even if demand did not exist so it could cover massive structural costs. It would then discount the vehicles to move them off dealer lots, which hurt profitability. And when gas prices spiked in 2008 and its product portfolio was truck-heavy, sales disappeared altogether and helped send it into a tailspin.
Reuss introduces the Malibu here, a bread-and-butter midsize sedan, launch of which was pulled ahead by some four months in anticipation higher demand for fuel-efficient passenger cars.
The new Malibu, due in February, will not receive a 6-cyl. engine option like the current model, and the first version to hit dealers will be the Malibu Eco variant featuring GM’s fuel-saving eAssist start/stop system.
The technology will appear first on the Buick LaCrosse and Regal. On the Malibu it promises fuel economy of 26-38 mpg (9.0-6.2 L/100 km) city/highway.
“We’re sending a message here,” Reuss says. “We’re leading with the Eco model version of this. That’s an important visual move on how General Motors is attacking these segments of cars. We’re going to go at it.”
The current-generation Malibu, which earned North American Car of the Year honors when it bowed with the ’08 model year, has sold more than 600,000 units in North America and a handful of export markets.
The new model will be sold around the world and built at new global locations in addition to Fairfax, KS, and Detroit-Hamtramck, if demand warrants.IT compliance: FAQs about IT operations, regulations and standards
This index links to resources about the relationship between IT operations and compliance regulations and standards, including HIPAA, e-discovery, SOX and PCI.
Applying regulatory mandates to IT operations is challenging, even for experienced security and compliance professionals. The FAQs listed below provide more information organized around specific topics -- each list of frequently asked questions is focused on how a given standard, regulation or law affects IT compliance. As we add more FAQs on IT compliance, you'll find them<<

Complying with the increasing number of regulations has made leveraging IT essential. That's particularly true in the automation of processes to handle the information in an organization's possession. As requirements grow, systems that both facilitate IT compliance and demonstrate to auditors that standards for security and data protection have been met are an increasingly critical area of IT operations.
Computer forensics
Computer forensics is perceived as a science rarely used by compliance officers. Not true. Learn more about how it's useful in a number of ways, including risk management.

Social media policies
Corporate social media policies are designed to protect against employees posting job complaints online, but cases show labor laws’ interpretation of these rules is fuzzy at best.
Sony PlayStation Network breach
The Sony PlayStation Network security breach affected millions of users. In this FAQ, learn how it was done, and its costs and likely ramifications.
SSAE 16
Examinations-based SSAE 16 has become a common tool for service providers to demonstrate risk controls to customers. But does passing an SSAE 16 report actually provide proof of sound regulatory compliance controls?
Target Data Breach

It may be the case that you can add the libs in the ear to a Manifest

support this for WAR files.

This was only my second Mother’s Day as a mother, but I’m just going to proclaim it to be my very favorite of all time anyway.
Last year was awesome because it was my very first time being celebrated as a mom, but this year, I got to spend the day with my completed little family.
I was totally spoiled for the entire weekend with things like flowers, cards, and a shopping trip to Vineyard Vines.
MT even wore the Ergo and pushed Michael in the stroller while we were at the mall, so I could completely relax. I am sure that some people thought that I was a total diva, but I certainly enjoyed my hands-free shopping experience anyway.
We also went to breakfast on Sunday morning, and Michael sported an insane hairdo that he gave to himself using a soapy baby bottle brush as a hairbrush.
My Mother’s Day dinner was a kale mixture with salmon. As you probably noticed, I also had wine which I regretted a bit when those nighttime feedings with Addison rolled around.
It was really fun to be so spoiled. I’m already looking forward to next year!
How was your Mother’s Day weekend?
Happy Mother’s Day!

Mac's was great. Noisy and crowded on a Saturday evening around 7pm. Got a seat at the bar. Had the pulled pork dinner. The pork was awesome, the sauce very tangy.

While the existence of a free, commercial-free radio experience might be hard to believe, Radical.FM offers its ad-free service on a “pay what you can” donation basis. This business model allows Radical.FM to support artists, composers and labels for the music streamed within the app.
“It’s a radical revenue model, and people wonder how we can pay music streaming’s high royalties on a free app without commercials,” said Radical.FM CEO Tom McAlevey. “When I drove my dune-buggy across Africa, I was confronted by Arabic police, spear-wielding natives, and AK-47-toting militia. More often than not, they helped rather than hindered me, reminding me that if treated with respect, people tend to do the right thing. As users discover Radical’s outstanding service, many of them will be proud to support it.”
Radical.FM is aiming for the jugular of its competitors with its “mixer board” feature that allows users to customize their own station with multiple overall genres, as well as targeted sub-genres and eventually individual songs. Once users choose their favorite genres (say, ‘Adult Pop’ and ‘Classic Rock’) they can “tune” their station by placing priority on one genre over another. Feel like rocking out to classics from the ‘80s? Tune the station to prioritize that genre. But what stops the platform from playing songs users aren’t interested in?
McAlevey tells us: “You’ve expressed an interest in a humanly created genre, therefore you will never be totally caught off guard. And if our experts missed an eclectic cut you really want, simply add it manually [via search].”
There’s always the possibility the app will play songs users aren’t familiar with, but users can immediately skip songs, or block songs and artists from reappearing later. On the other hand, “liking” a song adds these tracks to a “My Likes” list, which can be added to the user’s station just like any other genre, and then prioritized in the tuning section.
In addition to this release on Google Play, the iOS app has been updated since launch last summer with better “intuitiveness and speed.” Radical.FM is available to download for free on iOS and Google Play, with a desktop version currently in development.Raiders running back Darren McFadden met with reporters to discuss the six-year contract he signed late Thursday night.
Here’s how the contract breaks down, courtesy two league sources familiar with the this and that of it all.
The deal is worth up to $60 million. About $18 million of that is tied to incentives such as Pro Bowl appearances to Super Bowl performances, etc.
The guaranteed portion is $26 million, though technically, he has to do a few things to fully guarantee all the guaranteed money.
The “hard” guaranteed money is actually $19.685 million. McFadden essentially locks up all that money the first time he steps on a field.
The “soft” guaranteed money comes in the form of what is called the “falling of the log” bonus. It kicks in when McFadden reaches any one of an assortment of CBA-approved minimum stats or playing time once in any of the six seasons.
All McFadden has to do is meet one of the standards in any one season — things like playing 35% time as a rookie or 45% tof the time thereafter, rushing for 701 yards, catching 41 passes, etc.
In other words, if McFadden is remotely close to the player the Raiders expected when they drafted him fourth overall, that extra $6.3 million will be easily his.
Falcons quarterback Matt Ryan’s deal was similiar in that it with $27.3 million in hard guarantees, and $34.5 million in guarantees if he hits the “log bonus.
This way, McFadden knows he gets a big payday in Year 6 if he meets minimum standards, and the Raiders know they have a cheaper way out if McFadden is a bust.
If all goes as expected, McFadden will get all his guaranteed money and the Raiders will be more than happy to pay the man.Soaps Boards

FIRE Jill Farren Phelps....HIRE Kay Alden!
Please register and

There is an article on line with Jill Farren Phelps that was conducted by TV Guide and posted a little over a year ago. I read it then and again this morning. This is why I thought she and Josh Griffin were a package deal. They worked together on Hollywood Heights and (I think) Another World. Josh Griffin was a writer for Y&R during the writers strike several years ago. After that he was let go by Y&R. He only came back with JFP last year. In the article she talks about how glad she was to be able to have him because he knew the "history of the Y&R characters". Well, I'm sorry but he doesn't seem to know much if anything at all about the "history" of any of the characters IMO. It doesn't appear to me that any of the current regime has done their homework at all...So, IMO JFP and JG need to be replaced and ASAP...
Kay Alden is not a producer, she is a writer. So she wouldn't be a replacement for JFP. However, she would be a replacement for JG, who just as much needs to go. That said, even if they were to bring back in the regime from 2006, I think the damage has been done and there is no repairing Y&R to past glory days.
I tried warning everybody. I said that hiring JFP was the wrong thing to do. But, everybody told me to give her a chance even though I knew she was going to fail. If anybody watches GH you know what she has done to other shows.

Number of Runners: 34,000
Elevation: 365
Time: 3:37:27
Weather: 60 degrees, very windy
They call the Marine Corps Marathon, “The People’s Marathon,” and now I understand why. Besides the 34,000 runners, there were nearly 100,000 spectators lining the course. This is a marathon of the People, by the People, and for the People. And what better way to commemorate our independence, to celebrate our freedom, to honor our liberty and the men and women who protect it, than to boldly undertake the challenge of running a marathon through our nation’s capital.
It was a proud moment as I stood at the starting line and they announced to the crowd that I was running my forty-third consecutive marathon. The Marine’s next to me saluted me, which gave me the chills and made me chuckle at the same time. I got the chills because I felt so honored; I chuckled because we were all standing there in running gear.
Many of my friends and training partners are active in the service or have served our country. I am forever grateful to those who have protected our freedom and the rights of freedom loving people across the world. Running the Marine Corp Marathon was my way of saying, “Thank you.”
It was impossible not to feel proud to be an American as you ran past the Kennedy Center, entered the National Mall, ran past the Lincoln Memorial, Washington Monument, and then by our nation’s Capitol. On the return, you pass the Jefferson Memorial, the Pentagon, and eventually finish at the Marine Corps War Memorial. It is truly a beautiful course, a marathon of the monuments.
Conditions today were tough, with a strong wind blowing out of the north. There were also plenty of hills to contend with, especially near the end. My body is still a bit brutalized from the spill I took on Friday, and it showed, not just in the bandages on the outside, but also in the bruises and muscle soreness on the inside, which slowed me down. A few more days of heeling will be welcomed.
The people today were terrific, both the other runners and the spectators. This is the land of the free and the home of the brave, and I saw plenty of heroic efforts during the marathon, especially near the end when people were really hurting. Several runners ran arm-in-arm, shuffling courageously toward the finish. One man apparently collapsed ten feet from the finish, and then crawled across the line. Another limped on one leg through the finish as passersby shouted words of encouragement. Today, we
American’s band together, and although it wasn’t always pretty, we got the job done.
Fifty states, one nation, and lots of sore muscles,
Dean

Dean,
Almost a year and a half ago I read your book and it motivated me to run my first marathon, one year ago today. It was the Silicon Valley Marathon where I actually had the pleasure of meeting you! It was an awesome feeling completing that marathon.
Today, one year later, I stood by and watched my wife complete her first Half-Marathon, The Grape Stomp in Livermore, this was awesome as well. She certainly was thinking of your mantra, one foot in front of the other, as she completed this race.
You have motivated our family in many ways, and brought us closer. I thank you and your supportive family for all you have done, not just for us, but everyone you have touched.
Chad Conyers
PS The fact that today you ran the Marine Corps Marathon is icing on the cake considering 10 years of my life was spent as one of few and the proud!! OOO Rah!

On November 4, I'm running 50 miles to raise money and awareness for juvenile diabetes. My daughter Melissa, was in a diabetic coma last Christmas break and should have died. She's now a type 1, taking 4 shots a day and awaiting an insulin pump. While training for this, I've read your training tips in your book. I've been doing a lot of run/walks and they are helping tremendously. I follow your runs daily and am so inspired by you. Thanks for your training tips and may you be safe as you cross the finish line in NY. God bless you!!!

What a great race to watch this past Sunday! My wife, son and I were there cheering the runners! Hang in there, Dean! You are truly an inspiration to me and my family! Maybe one of these days I'll have the honor of running along side you!
Posted by: Rene | Monday, October 30, 2006 at 09:38:41:42 AM
Oh...I didn't realize you were already running marine corps...otherwise I would not have made that suggestion to you. I thought you were doing the 50 states, full marathons in 49 states and part of a marthon in both DC and Virginia--looks like Virginia and DC are getting gyped! You could have advertised 50/49 and 1/2/50--that would be more accurate. Your current 50/50/50 is misleading to me.
Perhaps if you ran the Marine Corp Marathon--again-as your 51st on November 6 you will do your promise justice.
This country has pains and people are suffering...but we have good spirit and if a leader such as yourself would do that 51st Marathon and go to the Senate floor with a cause (or 2 or 3 :0) ) you could help us all! The respect and charisma you have gathered from this event have given you this clout. Please do not waste it by not completing that last "extra" marathon. You have been all over the country, you know the issues, you know what our people need.
Please...just consider it.
Are you going to leave Virginia out of the pool?

Dean-
My brother inspired me to start running this past August. Despite being very overweight and never having run before, I kept at it. By the middle of September I was barely running at all. It was at this point that my brother gave me your book. I read it in a day, went running as soon as I finished, and haven't stopped running since that day.
Yesterday I ran my first race ever, the 5K attached to the Detroit Marathon. I was slow, but I finished, and it was the best feeling in the world. I have another 5K scheduled three weeks from now, and sometime this week or next I am signing up for the Cleveland Half Marathon in May. My goal is to run the marathon next year in Detroit.
I just wanted you to know that along with my brother, you have been one of the best influences in my life. I am finally getting in shape, and it is mostly due to you. Your determination and courage have inspired me in a way that nothing else ever has. I am eternally grateful to you for getting me back into running. It has become a passion that I simply can't life without. So thank you!!
I look forward to reading about your last week of marathons! I have been reading this whole time, and have enjoyed every single post. Good luck, and have fun! I can't wait to hear what you are doing next.

This year's Marine Corps Marathon was my second full race (Disney 2006, Goofy Challenge). I was excited to be running my first marathon without having run a 1/2 the day before - admitedly not the best way to begin marathon running - and was even more excited to be running in your 43rd of the 50 states. I wanted more than anything to run along side you, or catch a glimps of you during one of the turn-around points, but I was just far enough behind your pace to not be able to catch up, and far enough back to see you pass, several miles ahead of my (my chip time was 3:50). Ultramarathon Man was what inspired me to begin distance running, and gave me the courage to run last January's 1/2 and full marathons at Disney Wolrd. I wanted to thank you for the inspiration, and motivation driving me foward in the sport of endurance running. At only 20, I hope to run my first ultra (with the proper training) within the next several years; and to also complete the 7 continents (and 50 states ? ) before my 30th birthday. Thank you, Dean, for giving me the knowlege and determination to not only lead a healthful, active lifstyle, but also the will power to rise above fear and acomplish my goals.

Sorry I missed you at this race. Only a few minutes apart in finishing time, but I never found you. With so many people I am not surprised! I did however see your crew at the finish line, anxiously awaiting your arrival, and it was great to catch up with them since running with you in AZ and NV.
All I can say is...much respect to you and your E50 experience. The MCM was 4 in 5 weeks for me...and I am pretty spent! Wishing you much success in the final stretch!

Congrats on #43!! I went down to DC to see many of my friends run the marathon and I was lucky enough to see you run by around mile 10.5. I can't wait to run NYC this weekend with you! Although you'll probably be ahead of me the entire time, I am hoping to qualify for Boston. Reading your blog and hearing about other people's story has given me a different perspective on running. Your adventure has inspired me to train a little harder this summer and like you said in your book, "Life becomes a little more vibrant, a little more intense." I look forward to seeing you at the finish line party! Good luck on the next few!

Dean: Enjoyed running some of the way with you at Marine Corps. Sensed you wanted your space during this run so kept conversation to a minimum & tried to draw on the energy around us. However, hamstring injury returned as you passed me by at mile 18. It wasn't pretty but I finished as did my friend "Crazy Marty" who blew up as predicted. Hope you can get to Lincoln again sometime for one of our live Marathon Events to witness National Guard Teams competing from all 50 states & territories. Glen Moss.

WOW - what a great run Sunday! This was my 2nd marathon and boy was it beautiful. I finished 7 minutes faster than my goal time. I was disappointed that I did not get to see TEAM DEAN, but there were several truly inspirational runners out there. At mile 8 I ran past a woman pushing her friend in a wheel chair. At mile 17 I ran past a fether pushing his triplets in a stroller! When I got home I heard the news that a man passed away around mile 17. Devastating to hear. Also, shortly after the start of the first wave a runner had a heart attack, however he is expected to recover. Now back to the positive: I found out about a father who pushed his 17 year old daughter in a stroller who is developmentally disabled. Truly heartwarming. Their article can be found here:
Again, thanks for the inspiration that you instill in all of us.
Kepp it up!!!!

Dean, Thanks for the motivation the last full mile of the Marine Corps..You passed me exactly at the 25 mile point (right at the off ramp) and I was struggling but I picked it up and ran a 7:28 last mile to catch up and sprinted up the last hill at 26 and finished my 1st marathon with a 3:32. Thanks!

Dean-
I was one of the "Wellesley Girls" that jumped in halfway with you two weeks ago (though I am not a student there).
The Marine Corp Marathon was my first full marathon. What a day! You described it well. I was hoping to see you at the finish line, but couldn't find you. You had signed my shirt-sleeve with "Keep Going!" to give me encouragement past the wall. It must have worked - I never hit it! After reading your book in two days, I wanted to finish the marathon feeling like I could have kept going, but I was glad I didn't have to.
I did see you on the race course when it wrapped around next to itself; you were a few miles ahead of me by then. I heard a couple of girls squeal, "There he is!!! There he is!!!"; and saw you across the road. One girl commented to her friend that seeing you was the reason she ran the marathon.
Hopefully, I'll be driving down to NYC to cheer you on to your finish.
Thanks for all the inspiration! Good luck with the final few. Go Team Dean!

I was running the Nairobi Marathon several thousand miles away but the Endurance 50 was my main motivation. This was my 2nd marathon after competing last year but I had lost several weeks of training due to injury this time and had decided to compete in the half instead. At the last minute(during registration!) I decided to do the full. I completed in a 4:48 which was better than last year. Thanks Dean! PS The NY marathon will be televised here and I will be cheering you on to the Finish.

Dean,
While I had no illusions about seeing you along the course, I did run with my copy of your book, just in case, hoping for an autograph. Lucky for me, your book wasn't much longer, as I had a really rough day on the course. However, the great crowds and the reminder of all that our nations armed forces have done for us, made me keep at it.
I first decided to run a marathon after reading another book, 10 Million Steps. It's the story of Paul Reese who ran a marathon a day across the US. What was really inspiring was that he was 72 yrs old when he did it! I figured if HE could do one a day, I could do one :).
Now, after reading your book a few times, my next goal is an ultra. Thanks for getting out there and trying to raise the awareness of physical fitness in the U.S. I find it amazing that in our country's schools, many of them do not have Physical Education (aka "Gym" to us older folks) as a requirement in high school. No wonder we're getting to be a fatter, not fitter, nation.
Run on!

Dean,
I first read your article in Runners World about your goal of 50/50/50. After that I saw coverage on TV about the Marine Corps marathon. Your daughter is answering a question about why she thought you were doing all of this and she exclaims in part..."so that people get off their tushies and MOVE."
I had entered the Marine Corps marathon months before but hadn't followed any kind of training plan and I was thinking of not even running it. To make things worse, I had talked my sister into signing up for that as her first marathon. She followed her plan diligently and told me matter-of-factly that she would run it whether I did or not.
I was feeling a little down and not sure what to do when I saw the footage and thought that if you can do 50/50/50 then I could at least do the one thing that I had signed up to do do. It was extremely difficult for me but I completed the run. (My sister Crystal finished 38 minutes ahead of me.)
Thank you for your efforts and encouragement to all of us and the best to you on your next adventure.

Wine company Vintank has written a scathing review of SCVNGR on its blog; it encourages every small business to stop using the mobile checkin company for their marketing efforts.
"One of our jobs is to find technologies that will help the wine industry succeed," it writes. "Fortunately we have only made two mistakes in technologies that we have strongly supported in our three year history. Our most notable was SCVNGR."
Vintank explains that everything was "champagne and roses" at first. It liked SCVNGR's innovative elements, fair pricing, and the company's growing userbase. SCVNGR, Vintank says, offered cool features that Foursquare and Gowalla lacked, like mapping tools and a way to pair gaming with tourism.
Vintank says SCVNGR broke numerous promises throughout the campaign, such as releasing features Vintank assumed would be exclusive to its program and a Mashable party that never got thrown.
It sounds to us like both SCVNGR and Vintank are at fault. Vintank probably dealt with an eager sales person at SCVNGR who over-promised to gain a new client. We >>Stoke-on-Trent

Built in 1848 by the North Staffordshire Railway Company, this Grade-II* listed station was conceived in the style of a 'Jacobean manor-house', assembled with dark red brick and emblazoned with stone dressings. Designed as the company's headquarters, its grandeur reflected the ambition of the times.
With only three platforms, the station seems far wider than is necessary, but this isn't ostentation, as it was originally designed to accommodate non-stopping 'through trains'.

- By VeloNews.com
- Published Nov. 25, 2013
Tim Johnson (Cannondale-Cyclocrossworld.com) rode to his second victory of the weekend on day 2 of the Supercross Cup Sunday.
Johnson crossed the finish line four seconds ahead of Jeremy Durrin (Optum-Kelly Benefit Strategies) for the win. Kerry Werner (Mock Orange) was third for the second straight day, a further two seconds adrift.
Action took place at the Anthony Wayne Recreation Area in Stony Point, New York.
In the women’s race, Laura Van Gilder (Van Dessel-Mellow Mushroom) beat Arley Kemmerer (C3-Twenty20) by four seconds. Taking third was Emma White (Cyclocrossworld.com).
On Saturday, Kemmerer finished first ahead of Van Gilder and White.
FILED UNDER: Cyclocross / News / Race Report TAGS: Laura Van Gilder / Supercross Cup / Tim JohnsonPros :
Crisp, bright, colourful display; Connecting to tablet dock is simple and offers extra battery life; decent 13-megapixel snapper with plenty of features.
Cons :
Rather dear; Wobbly back when handset is docked; back panel is plasticky.
Verdict:
The Asus Padfone 2 proves to be a powerful smartphone with plenty of desirable features, as well as a useful tablet dock when you want a bigger screen and extra battery life.
The Asus’ Padfone 2 has a dual personality. One minute it looks like your average mobile, the next, you can team it with its own special ‘station’ dock and you’ve got a 10in tablet, with the added bonus of 3G/4G connectivity.
Back to black
A first glance at the Padfone 2 and you’ll see a business-like black chunk of handset that features the usual Asus concentric circles on its reverse and a silver edge. Unlike the Asus Zenbook laptops, which we love, the phone does not have a metal back panel. Despite this it still feels quite solid and weighs a suitably hefty 135g.
You can’t prise off the back panel – instead there’s a pin-hole SIM card slot on the top of the handset and the power and volume keys sit on the right edge. At the bottom of the handset is an odd proprietary USB port into which you can plug your usual Micro USB cables, although we found them rather wobbly. It’s best to use the funky custom USB cable provided by Asus.
The docking station is your average tablet with a black border (it looks rather like the Asus Transformer Prime). Team it with the phone and weight-wise you’re looking at something similar to the iPad. It has a rubber back that helps you to keep a firm grip on it. We only have one grumble – and that’s that when they’re joined, the phone/tablet combination has an uneven back, so if you place it on a table it wobbles rather – you’ll need to hold it to use it successfully.
However, the tablet and phone connect easily and quickly – the tablet fires up as soon as you connect them – and the phone sits safely inside the dock without any fear of falling out.
Two become one
Once the Padfone 2 and the dock are connected you have several benefits to enjoy. First and most obvious you get a bigger display for playing games, watching films and viewing and editing snaps. You can also use the 3G/4G connectivity of the phone to get on the internet – great for streaming TV and movies.
Battery life is extended thanks to the station’s built-in battery – Asus say you’ll get 36 hours of life out of the phone and station together.
On the handset itself we managed to stream video for a decent seven hours – but once it was connected to the station we got nearly a day’s worth of streaming. Even with heavy use with the display brightness cranked up we still got a day of battery life – the power save mode helps with this.
So what happens if the phone and station are connected and you get an incoming call? The Station interrupts whatever you’re doing and lets you choose to reject, answer or reply using a text message. You’ll want to use a headset to reply to calls – otherwise you’ll have to lift the rear of the tablet up to your face to speak into the mic. Or just pull the handset out of the dock and use the handset as normal.
The only pity is that the dock doesn't work on its own – we’d have liked to see it becoming a simple web browser or digital photo frame. But then, as we always have our phones with us, it’s probably not really an issue.
Very jelly
The Padfone 2 runs Android 4.1 Jelly Bean, which has been given some Asus tweaks and looks good. There are custom widgets for weather/clock, battery status and so on – all of them can be re-sized. There is quite a lot of bloatware included but we still found we had usable storage adding up to 25GB – and to be fair it’s easy to delete anything you don’t want. The notification bar has benefited from some nice tweaks – there a quick button to change settings such as Wi-Fi, and a sliding brightness bar.
Under the hood a quad-core 1.5GHz Qualcomm chip ensures the Padfone 2 runs smoothly even if you’re firing up some demanding apps, we did see one browser crash – but it seemed to be a one-off. LTE support and NFC ensure it’s future proof.
Key points
Asus has included an onscreen keyboard that is more complicated than the usual Android one. There’s a full row for numbers and the most used punctuation. It does mean some of the keys are somewhat cramped though.
The keyboard is clever too – start typing in the web address field and .com and @ buttons appear. The keyboard can be exchanged for a handwriting recognition pad – which works well – or your choice of Android board.
On the back of the handset sits a 13-megapixel snapper. To take a shot almost instantly just hit the volume button on either the phone or tablet. Daytime shots proved sharp with good colour reproduction – even when we looked at them on a large screen. Auto-focus works well, although our macros pictures suffered from some blur. In low light our snaps proved too dark to be used, but there is a good flash that manages to light up a small room, without overexposure.
There are lots of manual options for tweaking, along with burst shot and panorama mode. A front-facer takes crisp self-portraits. The photos can be edited and you can add in some fun adjustments should you wish. It’s easier to edit pictures using the station than on a phone – and you don’t have to fiddle about with transferring or cables. You just plug and play.
Pleasure and business
The Padfone 2 is a great business device but is also good for entertainment. The display measures 4.7 inches and is bright enough to withstand glare and has great viewing angles. Games, websites and films look great on the 1280 x 720 resolution screen – zoom in on a website and you’ll still be able to read small text. The extra thin glass also makes it look like the screen is right on the surface.
Our conclusion
The Asus Padfone 2 is rather dear at £599, but if you were planning on buying a tablet and phone, you’d probably spend about the same. The Padfone 2 is a great smartphone and the addition of the Station dock gives you the benefit of being able to view films and surf the net on a bigger screen – and an extended battery life.

Anyway, Steve's onstage at this lovely Washington Square church, in full lovely mumbled roar and magnificent comb-over, cracking familiar jokes, but familiar the way old friends (or exes) are familiar:
"This is for what's her name, wherever she is."
[Plays forlorn love song.]
[Ends song, changes harmonica.]
"Okay, same girl, different harmonica."
[Plays another forlorn love song.]
His crowd is rapt, hooting and clapping and interrupting his ambling spiels about dogs, Italy, Lightnin' Hopkins, Townes Van Zandt, the death penalty. Oh yes. It is an election year, you will recall.
"I'm opposed to the death penalty, whatever the crime, no matter what."
[Applause.]
"That includes Osama bin Laden."
[Less applause.]
"That includes Dick Cheney."
[Relieved laffs.]
And then he plays forlorn anti-death-penalty ballad "Billy Austin," and it's fuckin' devastating. Love this dude. He's got like 500 songs with "Road" in the title, and they're all splendid. A forgivable indulgence, and speaking of which, he rocks out for 2:20 at least, and only really tears into material off last year's so-so Washington Square Serenade in the second hour. This involves special guests, both excellent (current wife/opening act Allison Moorer, harmonizing splendidly on "Down Here Below") and, uh, quixotic.
The DJ. For more than an hour the turntables loomed behind Steve almost like a threat, but here comes the DJ, who looks less like a DJ and more like the guy who beats the crap out of people at Yankees games for wearing Red Sox gear. For the first several tunes the DJ merely drops the beat and plays with the knobs for five minutes or so; emboldened, he eventually tries backing vocals (goes well) and actual scratching (does not). I respect Steve's attempts at innovation, but this does not rise to the artistic level of the R.E.M./KRS-One duet, if you know what I'm saying.
But "Galway Girl" is better, and the newer rabble-rousing, Pete Seeger-toasting "Steve's Hammer" is too. "People say I'm preaching to the choir," Steve announces. "But sometimes the choir needs preaching to." His last two words to us are "thanks" and "Obama."
Steve Earle plays the Judson Memorial Church tonight (September 23), Thursday (the 25th), and Friday (the 26th). Tickets are here.
Sponsor ContentIran will earn four billion dollars less in oil revenues in its next fiscal year if the global oil price slump continues, a conservative MP and economic expert was quoted in the press Tuesday, November 27 as saying.
"If the drop (in prices), which was provoked by the stagnant global economy, continues, the sale receipts of oil for the Iranian state will face a lack of four billion dollars for the next (Iranian) year, said Mohammad-Baqer Nobakht.
Iran, which is the second largest producer in the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC), has a fiscal year that begins on March 21. Oil exports account for some 80 percent of Iran's foreign currency revenues. They generated $24 billion in the last Iranian year, compared with a forecast of $11 billion. The 2001/2002 budget was based on an oil price of more than $20 a barrel. With each drop of one dollar in the price per barrel, Iran loses one billion dollars in revenue.
Nobakht, who spoke at a Tehran meeting Monday on the impact on the global economy of the post-September 11 situation, said the "Iranian year 1381 (2002-2003) will not be an easy one for the state." He said the government must adopt a "crisis plan" if the drop in prices on the global oil market continues, adding that the September 11 terror strikes on the United States had caused some $200 billion in damage to the global economy.
Oil prices have dropped by close to 20 percent since September 11. The price of Iranian oil, which had risen to $24 a barrel during the first six months of the current Iranian year, has fallen to less than $20.
Iranian Oil Minister Bijan Namdar Zangeneh called on non-OPEC oil producers earlier this month to "negotiate and cooperate" to cut world crude production and "avoid a collapse in prices in the months to come." Iran currently produces 3.5 million barrels a day, 2.1 million barrels of which are exported. — (AFP, Tehran)

Sadly, the author decided to make the more recent version of the screen recorder program shareware. However, I consider the program well worth the money. Good news is that the new version of Bulent's screen recorder also supports audio recording.
Besides recording instant messenger or web based webcam sessions, the recorder can also be used to record computer instruction videos (screencasts), for example you can record the installation and usage of a program as an instruction movie for others.
Since the freeware version of Bulent's screen recorder is difficult to find, I mirror this version (1.5a) on this web site. If you download this program from a different location, make sure that the MD5 sum equals: 7892ceded239c854b62ee82b266dcc53. The name of the file is: InstallBSR_v15a.exe.- On-Air Playlist

Series: First Corinthians: Cutting Through the Noise
Description
1 Corinthians
J.D. Greear
10/10/2021
As we continue through the book of 1 Corinthians in our series, “Cutting Through the Noise,” Pastor J.D. explores a topic that is as contentious to us today as it was to the people in Corinth—sex. Our society has a lot of competing ideas about what sex is for and what makes sex good. God has ideas, too. And since sex was his idea, it’s well worth listening to the wisdom he has to share.alone (its orginal thai title is fadd (แฝด) which literally means ‘twins’ in english) tells a story a thai couples (ploy & vee) both working and living in korea. on one night, ploy receives an emergency phone call from thailand notified that her mother just had a stroke. ploy and vee then have to fly back immediately.
after a while, the film starts to tell the audience that ploy is used to be conjoined twins but she had the operation to seperate her and her sister when they were fifteen years old. the result of that operation led to her sister’s death. after arriving at her old house, she begins to feel that she has been watched. someone or something is staying beside her. she’s believing it must be her sister coming back from the dead to reclaim her life.
masha wattanapanich successfully portrays the role of conjoined twins with her exceptional acting skills. background music is just brilliant. special effects used in this film suits are all good, though many scenes are not so originals as many people who’ve seen it told me there’re several scenes that resembling to hollywood film ‘what lies beneath’ and korean film 장화, 홍련 (a tale of two sisters)… fortunately i’ve never seen ‘what lies beneath’ and i remembered turning off television after watching ‘장화, 홍련’ on dvd for 50 minutes because it was so boring. in fact, there’re very few originalities in horror films these days, so i wouldn’t mind watching the same effect which was previously used in other films if they can put it in the right moment like this one. personally i think it’s stupid if we’re going to watch a film to catch if the scenes we just saw were used in other films without really looking into the context of the whole film.
my most favorite scene is the scene where masha walking by the beach alone. it’s so thrilling! i would freak out if i was in that situation. another unforgetable scene is the sound of breathing.
in my opinion, the weak point of this film is the plot. there’re some unexplainable scenes. i believe 50% percent of the audience who constantly watch thriller / suspense / horror flicks would be able to figure out the ending after watching half of the film. there’s nothing seriously wrong with that. i just thought it would be great if they could add something more twisted, more unexpected.
though ‘alone’ can’t surpass their previous work titled ‘shutter’ but ‘alone’ is definitely can be called as a decent thriller film. recommend for all horror/thriller film lovers.

The pain is much more pronounced when out of the saddle and 'giving it some' especially on the descents.

Students, Faculty Embark on Ecuador Service Learning Trip
December 23, 2013
A group of 13 Lasell students led by Environmental Studies Chair Aaron Toffler will visit two communities in Ecuador for an international service learning trip in January.
The group, which also will include Professor Jose Guzman and Associate Director, Graduate Student Services Gillian Stanley, leaves for Ecuador on January 6 and returns January 13.
The students will spend time in Machachi, continuing work started by last year's Ecuador trip participants, and then will travel to Guaranda to work on several different projects.
"It is slightly different this year in that we will be spending more time in Guaranda than we have in the past. There is the possibility in the future of a long-term partnership with a university there," said Toffler.
The students will work with several schools while in the two different locations, following up on projects in Machachi where last year's group built a greenhouse out of plastic bottles and planted a garden at the school. Then the group will begin new work in Guaranda.
The trip to Ecuador is part of the Shoulder to Shoulder Program at the College, a cultural immersion and service-learning program in which students learn about various social justice issues within a global context.
Preparation for the Ecuador program occurs in the Fall semester as a part of the Environmental Service in Ecuador course. This course is required for all participants and covers the climate, ecology, history, and culture of Ecuador, in addition to addressing pre-trip travel administrative details and some language study. Participants are selected each spring through the Shoulder to Shoulder application process. Friday, 4 September 2009 17:41:30 UTC

This was a fast-paced, fact-packed workshop by three industry professionals. Steve Laube, with the Steve Laube Agency,covered land mines which may give agents heart attacks, such as an author quoting a copyrighted song in a book. Never assume anything you quote is free! Always check first.
Next, Laube, Rick Acker, and Cara Putman, covered the main items in a contract, such as:
- The Option Clause: Which gives the publisher the right of first refusal to your next work and how to limit this right to the author’s advantage.
- Basket Accounting: Where all books in a contract must earn-out the author’s advance on royalties before any more royalties can be paid.
- Author’s right to audit the publisher’s sales and royalty statements (costly).
- Author copies:The negotiation over the number of author copies provided (as many as possible).
- Terms of reversion (make sure this is clearly delineated) were also discussed.
Even though I’ve signed book contracts, this workshop provided a good review for me. Well done.Now Playing

Which is less than four months away.
Oh. My. God.
So that's lit a real fire under me. I cleared off my desk, located folders that have been AWOL since the move, and I'm ready to write. (So of course here I am, blogging away.) Truth is, I've been dawdling a bit of late and blaming it on family responsibilities or the mountains of papers we all grade. And blogging (by which I mean both reading and writing) has been a terrific way to procrastinate, although a relatively productive one, emotionally and psychologically speaking.
I've been photo blogging quite a bit this past week because I've been working instead on my posts for BlogHer. In case you haven't checked out "my" section, Research & Academia, please do stop by. Also let me know if you'd like to be added to the blogroll. I'm a bit behind on it, so you may already be on my list, but a nudge won't hurt a bit. :)

Let the fire burn, baby. (Just don't get too crisp.) You're almost there. Nothing like a deadline. Remember if you push up hill, it's all coasting down from there.

Nationals beat reporter Bill Ladson answers questions from fan
Should the Nats be worried about sending their pitchers to the World Baseball Classic? Will there be pressure on them to pitch too many innings too soon?
-- Paul F., Arlington, Va.
The Nationals are not worried about Gio Gonzalez or Ross Detwiler. They are pitching the right amount of innings to get ready for the regular season. However, manager Davey Johnson expressed concern about outfielder Eury Perez, who was optioned to Triple-A Syracuse on Thursday and is currently playing for the Dominican Republic. Perez is not getting playing time in the Classic, and Johnson would like for him to get at-bats once he returns to Minor League camp.
Who are going to be the lefties for the Nationals by Opening Day?
-- Ian R., Bethesda, Md.
Outside of Detwiler and Gonzalez, Zach Duke will be the only lefty on the team. Most of the lefties -- other than those three -- have not been productive. Johnson said he is not worried about not having enough lefties in the bullpen. He believes Rafael Soriano, Tyler Clippard, Ryan Mattheus and Drew Storen can handle left-handed hitters.
With Tyler Moore on the big league roster, what do you think will happen to Chris Marrero?
-- Norm P., Syracuse, N.Y.
Unless he gets traded -- and I don't think he will -- Marrero will spend most of the season with Triple-A Syracuse and will likely get a callup in September. It's too bad, because he should be set in the big leagues. The hamstring injury really hurt him last year.
Would the Nats ever consider adding Kyle Lohse to the roster?
-- Derek C., Stittsville, Ontario
At this time, the Nationals don't have interest in Lohse unless one of their starting pitchers gets hurt. If they are interested in Lohse, I don't see the Nationals giving him a three-year deal that has been reported. It would be no more than a one-year deal.
Please find out where Cole Kimball is in his rehab. I would like to know if he's anywhere close to pre-surgery velocity.
-- Dave C., Arlington, Va.
I wouldn't say he is in a rehab mode. I would say he is close to throwing the 95-mph fastball that he once threw. Kimball is having a solid spring, allowing two runs in 6 1/3 innings. The chances of him making the team are slim, however..
-- Patrick S., Chantilly, Va.
A trade will not come, not this year anyway. Let's say Espinosa gets hurt and needs to go on the disabled list, who is going to play second base? Lombardozzi is the obvious choice with Zach Walters as the backup.
Considering he had a very good year with Triple-A Syracuse in 2012, what are the chances of outfielder Corey Brown making the team?
-- Alex C., Montreal
Unless someone gets hurt, the chances of Brown making the big league club are slim. If he isn't traded, I expect him to be a September callup:Roberto Orci Will Direct Star Trek 3

Content:
Francisco Suárez (1548-1617) is today regarded as a very prominent figure in the intellectual landscape of the later sixteenth century and the beginnings of the seventeenth century. Thanks to the renewed attention to his work throughout the twentieth century, it has become increasingly clear that the magister Eximius holds an original, sometimes even revolutionary position in between many of the dualisms that seem to mark this complex era, between natural rights and the legislator for example, or between ethical objectivism and voluntarism.0
Suárez work points in innovative ways towards future thought in fields as diverse as metaphysics and ontology, legal theory, constitutional thought, the law of nature and of nations and just war. In this framework, a number of contemporary debates crystallise around Suárez’ legal and political thought and centre on key notions, such as obligation, or focus on the broader interconnectedness of De legibus and Disputationes metaphysicae. These debates furthermore display a variety of diverging or opposing ideas and interpretations that concern a vast panoply of themes. The role of contract, the concept of natural law, the relation between contingency, history and law, or the subjective meaning of ‘ius’ are just a few examples in this respect. At the same time, research uncovers new fields and sources with respect to Suárez’ influence and intellectual impact, as for example the increasing interest in his legacy in protestant countries shows.
This conference aims to bring together contributions from different backgrounds in Suárez Studies that focus on the various aspects and subfields of Suárez’ multifaceted legal and political thought. Within this framework, papers are invited on any subject of Suarez’ political and legal thought, including his relation to contemporary scholars, his intellectual sources as well as his own later influence and reception.Scientific Coordinator

When I was 13 years old, I had a sudden revelation that eating animals was wrong and cruel. I would hear stories about the unethical treatment of them, and my heart would melt. Thus, I became a vegetarian.
Becoming a vegetarian is not for everyone, especially those who are devoted to meat. However, it doesn’t hurt to try. Some may say they don’t have enough will power or dedication, but I was the same when I first started.
The first few weeks were difficult since my family eats meat, but after my mother realized that I was not going to change, she started preparing separate meals for me.
The whole process of becoming a vegetarian takes some time to get used to. It will not come instantaneously. You have to be strictly devoted to the vegetarian mindset. If you just want to change your eating habits for fun, chances are that you will not last very long.
There are many reasons for becoming a vegetarian. An important one is the increase in nutrients and decrease in fat. Typically, vegetarians substitute meat with healthier foods such as fruits, vegetables, beans, and whole grains.
If you eat the right foods, you will still get the necessary nutrients. Although you are relinquishing meat, you must figure out how to maintain protein intake, or else you will become sick.
To replace the protein in meat, you can substitute a variety of foods, including imitation meat, soy products, and nuts. All of these are great sources of protein.
While meat provides a lot of protein, it also carries a ton of saturated fat. By cutting out meat, you’ll be cutting out a lot of bad fat and replacing it with healthier substitutes.
I hope this article has given you some insight into the benefits of becoming a vegetarian. You may be reluctant to give up all the tasty meats, but after realizing the positive effects on your health, I hope you will consider this dietary change. ♦

The goal of this project is to mitigate racism and bias-influenced outcomes in health professions education programs through interprofessional collaboration. Participation in this project can empower all faculty, instructors, and other interprofessional health professions educators (HPEs) to act as upstanders, or someone with integrity and courage who recognizes when something is wrong, acts to make it right, and hopefully prevents it from happening again. To assist in this process, the following will be developed and implemented: 1) develop an educational toolbox, including a training manual, and 2) conduct workshops using didactic education, trigger films, and simulation. Trigger films are short educational video vignettes that illustrate a specific theme and focus on social guidance themes that engage the affective domain. Newly created scenarios will present a social or practice issue intended to trigger a response by the viewer, and initiate participant reflection and discussion by highly trained facilitators. These tools will guide standardization and sustainability of a proposed educational program.

Orient Technologies released the new OrientDB-ETL component in beta version to easily pump data into OrientDB database without writing a line of code. So far the available extractors are:
Most of DBMSs support JDBC driver. All you need is to gather the right DBMS’s JDBC driver and put it in the classpath or simply in the $ORIENTDB_HOME/lib directory.
All yo need is to write a JSON file containing the ETL process. Create a new file dbms2orient.json somewhere. With the configuration below all the records from the table “Client” are imported in OrientDB from MySQL database. Start from this one.
{ "config": { "verbose": true, }, "extractor" : { "jdbc": { "driver": "com.mysql.jdbc.Driver", "url": "jdbc:mysql://localhost/mysqlcrm", "userName": "root", "userPassword": "", "query": "select * from Client" } }, "transformers" : [ { "vertex": { "class": "Client"} } ], "loader" : { "orientdb": { "dbURL": "plocal:/temp/databases/orientdbcrm", "dbAutoCreate": true } } }
After installed the component execute the command:
$ oetl dbms2orient.json
That’s all. To improve ETL by using Transformers look at the documentation.Abstract
Motivated by applications to probability and mathematical finance, we consider a parabolic partial differential equation on a half-space whose coefficients are suitably Hölder continuous and allowed to grow linearly in the spatial variable and which become degenerate along the boundary of the half-space. We establish existence and uniqueness of solutions in weighted Hölder spaces which incorporate both the degeneracy at the boundary and the unboundedness of the coefficients. In our companion article (Feehan and Pop [12]), we apply the main result of this article to show that the martingale problem associated with a degenerate-elliptic partial differential operator is well-posed in the sense of Stroock and Varadhan.

2)
With the 'Taunt' button are you aloud to use it to random people on the street or only in a situation where you’re killing thugs?
You can taunt anyone in the game – most will give you Balls (Balls builds Blind Rage – Blind Rage turns you into a UNSTOPPABLE ******* KILLING JUGGERNAUGHT who can not be stopped – not to mention it also heals you every time you kill someone). We have tons of taunts on our taunt button (or more colorfully put – our “**** You” button). There are no restrictions on when you can use it – you can do it shooting at people or driving a boat or car and use it. You can use it to taunt people out of vehicles when you raise your Rep (they just get out and give you their car – you don’t attract cop heat this way and you get major balls for doing so).
3)
Will the game have DTS surround sound capabilities?
We support:
Dolby Pro Logic II on PS2
Dolby Surround & Dolby Pro Logic on Xbox
In addition to that we did all of our remixing w/ Skywalker Sound w/ Randy Thom and his amazingly talented Academy Award-winning sound team on a THX-calibrated sound stage – our sound is AMAZING and will be fun for those who have a great sound system who will be happy to find the best sound in any open world game to date – its no ******* joke – it rocks.
Round 7
1. Does the game really have that much of a storyline? Or will it be more like just walking up and talking to someone on the street rather than an actual cut scene that progresses the story?
Big time storyline written by Hollywood script writer David McKenna (who also wrote Blow and American History X). Lots of cutscenes to progress the story featuring the VO cast.
2. Do your rivals attack your warehouses occasionally?
No. They attack your fronts.
3. Are there thieves that will try to steal your ride?
Like, carjackers? No. But rival gangs will notice you as you drive around the city and attack you on foot and also from opposing vehicles.
4. Tony doesn't always wear the same clothes, so I was wondering will there be any cloth shops in the game?
You can unlock the ability to choose your clothing options.
5. Will there be any "small" side missions in the game that have no connection with the main story?
Yes. Drug Dealing and Distribution missions come to mind. Also the small little side missions that unlock these drug missions.
6. Roughly how many different pedestrian models are in the game?
Hard to say – hundreds of uniques.
7. Can Tony hire goons to protect his mansion if so does it mean the mansion will be attacked just like his storefronts?
No. the mansion is off limits.
8. Are there any mini games to play?
Lots of minigames – especially gambling. There’s blackjack, poker, video poker, video blackjack, slot machines, blood sports and more.
9. Are there other things that you can purchase to improve your storefronts other than cameras and henchman?
More storefronts and warehouses.
10. What gangs are present in Miami and how do you go about reducing gang heat or cant you?
There are gangs that are aligned with all each of the main bosses for each turf, so Gaspar, the Diaz Brothers, etc. You can reduce your gang heat by completing good drug deals, intimidating gang members or just paying down the heat with cash through your Empire menu.
11. Is the islands only purpose to buy drugs?
Not sure I totally understand this question, but the Islands is full of additional missions. You have to go there to secure contacts to keep the cocaine flowing into Miami. There are enemies out there too that you have to defeat. It is the place from which you run major drug supplies into Miami, but there’s more to it than just going and getting drugs.
12. What obstacles will Tony face when running drugs from the islands to Miami?
In the Islands – pirates – not the Jack Sparrow type, the drug-running type with speedboats with big machine guns on the bow. In Miami – the Coast Guard. Drive fast.
13. I read somewhere about a Respect System how does it work?
When you escape the mansion, you lose everything. You become the lowest rung again. All of your reputation is gone. There are 8 reputation levels – one for each letter in the word Scarface. As you complete missions, complete drug deals, buy exotics and many other activities, you receive reputation points. Eventually, you will level up your reputation to the next letter, unlocking more exotics, bigger drug deals, etc. Also, people you talk to who disrespect you at the beginning of the game will change as your reputation climbs. You won’t have to throw someone out of a car later in the game, just walk up and demand the keys and they will gladly hand them over to Mr. Montana.
14. Can Tony’s Driver actually do the driving for Tony without having to change characters?
No.
15. Can you choose weapons for Tony’s henchman or do they all have default weaponry?
You can choose.
16. Will Tony be able to purchase Aircraft such as Helicopters?
Only the sea plane – this vehicle will take you to any dock in the world instantly – in Miami or the Islands.
17. The majority of the things that you can buy from the exotics catalog, can you use it or is most of it decoration?
Kind of a split. You can buy a ton of things to decorate your mansion, for sure, but you can also buy cars, trucks, boats, etc. You can buy weapons and weapons upgrades from your arms dealer, but that’s not through the exotics menu. Each item you buy in the exotics menu will give you a reputation bonus, however, so they pay off in other ways, even if it is just a stuffed tiger.
In addition, later in the game, when you are able to buy Investments from the exotics menu – these change the game dramatically for Tony’s benefit. They are expensive, but not only upgrade reputation, but also alter his in game performance and statistics to make him a better Tony. Awesome stuff in there.
Round 8
1.
can you change from country like u'll could play in bolivia to and stuff but how will this work then ?
You’ll go there for storyline missions multiple times and you also go there to run large shipments of cocaine. You can go there at any time and do some of the random missions on the islands as well – just take a boat and cruise there or purchase the seaplane and warp to any dock in the game, in Miami or the Islands.
2.
When you finished of Sosa , will there still be shoot outs and stuff with other gangs and drugslords?
If you want to complete the game to 100% -- you’ll need to go back and clean out all the gang nests, complete all 250 NPC conversations, etc.
3.
Is the game-world unlocked right away? Because it's kinda boring when You start the game and every place is unlocked right away...You know, it's nice to put some effort on missions so You can unlock new places, like in GTA.
The entire city is unlocked from the get go, but you work your way towards actually running missions and taking over different sections of the city. I think it’s MORE frustrating to have a so-called “open world” game where have the city is blocked off by concrete barricades for no real reason.
4.
Does Tony go back to his job flipping bugers at the beginning of the game for a while?
No. Tony is still Tony Montana and he knows he can rebuild his empire from the ground up. He still has some contacts left to help him get back on his feet, so there’s no need to go make minimum wage somewhere. He starts small and builds from there.
5.
Will Locations such as Montana Travel and Management, Ginas Hair Salon and the restaurant where Tony said goodnight to the bad guy be present in the game.
All of Tony’s possessions are gone. All of his business are completely wiped away. However, through the exotics menu, you can reinvest in businesses that will build up your abilities.
6.
Do Pedestrians talk to each other?
Yes.
7.
How do you gain respect?
Completing missions. Doing good drug deals. Wiping out gangs. Buying exotics.
8.
How long does it take on average to complete a story mission?
Really depends. From a few minutes to a bit longer.
9.
Can Tony later on in the game purchase the Sun Ray Motel and the bar at Coconut Grove?
Sun Ray – yes. That is a purchasable front. The Coconut Grove is not purchasable, but you’ll be there pretty early on.
10.
Can Tony have guards at a Storehouse?
No. Storehouses do not get attacked. They are already reinforced.
11.
can tony get hurt by fire?
No.
12.
can you take the top down on a convertible?
Tops are already down.
13.
will tony show when he's low on health, like blood on his clothes and him holding himself
14.
can you go into blind rage mode when you're inside a vehicle?
15.
Will you have to play through the story mode more than once to unlock all the extra content in the game?
16.
Are there any alternate endings in the game?
Yes. Finish the game to 100% complete – lots involved in that.
ROUND 9
1) I would like to ask what are going to be the PC requirements to run the game. The reason why is so I know if I need to upgrade my PC a bit to play the game.
MINIMUM:
* Windows(R) 2000/XP
* Pentium(R) 4 1.8 GHz or AMD(R) equivalent
* 256 MB RAM
* DirectX(R) 9.0c-compatible video card (ATI(R) Radeon(R) 9200 or NVIDIA(R) GeForce(R) FX 5500 with 128 MB RAM) or higher
* DirectX(R) 9.0c-compatible sound card and speakers or headphones
* Microsoft(R)-compatible mouse and keyboard
* 16x DVD-ROM
* 2.9 GB of uncompressed hard drive space
* DirectX(R) 9.0c-compatible sound card and speakers or headphones
* Microsoft(R)-compatible mouse and keyboard
* 16x DVD-ROM
* 5 GB of uncompressed hard drive space
2) Could you take cover in the game during a shootout like leaning against the wall and when you aim you shoot and return to the wall automatically after you stop shooting? Are you able to crouch on the floor and shoot? Could you also walk while you’re crouching?
Yes. If you approach a wall, you can press a single button (X on PS2) to “wall hug.” You can then slide along the wall to a doorway, for instance, and use the camera to look into the room on the other side. When you find a target, lock on and fire to swing out and shoot. When you release the lock on, you go back behind the wall. You can also take cover behind shorter items like bars and short walls by crouching or using the X button. You can move while crouched.
3) Could you jump? Could you also climb over fences or walls?
You can not jump in the game. There is never a need for it. Tony’s not much of a jumper anyway. J
4) About the pilot-henchman-assassin etc... your gonna be able to switch them on the go? You can bring a henchman in a mission and control him to do some part of it, or watch a door or something? Will they be driving Tony's car or just be passenger? Will they say something when they kill their target example:" Tony send is regards" or something a little bit like the Godfather.
No switching on the go. You can switch to a henchman and then do missions for Tony – this is a great way to make more money in the game besides just dealing drugs as Tony. Tony’s missions are Tony’s – rebuilding the empire – while the henchman have their own missions to do for Tony. You can not switch in the middle of a mission.
5) Can you take over the turfs in any order you want?
No. Each turf is unlocked as you progress through the game and acquire reputation points and conquer a previous turf. Difficulty levels and cost to purchase fronts escalate as you go along.
6) Will the DEA be present in the game at all?
7) How many Rooms are there in Tony’s mansion?
A lot of rooms.
8) When your heat is in the red will SWAT and Police Helicopters be Present?
When you are in the red – move fast. The cops will be after you the ambition of killing you. They put down roadblocks and spike strips and chase you all over the map.
9) When the pirates are hunting you, can you choose which character you want to play? (I mean the boat driver or Tony?).
No, because Tony runs his yayo into the city himself. It’s too important.
10) I know that there is a health circle for the cars, but when you're running on high speed and crash into a tree or a wall, will Tony lose energy from his health circle?
No, the car will take damage. The car acts like another layer of armor for Tony. That’s why it’s important to choose carefully when selecting a car to call in before a big combat mission. The more you use the car to shoot FROM, the less damage Tony takes. Of course, if the baddies get close, they’ll rip you out of the car and then you’re on your own!
11) What happens when you lose a front how do you get it back?
Once a front is purchased, you won’t lose it later in the game. However, it will be attacked by gang members and can be destroyed if you don’t defend it. If this happens, you will have to pay a fee to have it rebuilt and put back into operation. Depending on the front, it can be somewhat affordable (like $20,000 for smaller shops like Pedro’s Pawn Shop) or it can be very expensive, like $4 million for some of the pricier fronts later in the game. This is another layer in the strategic gameplay inherent in SFTWIY that you won’t find in other open world games – Say you’re on a distribution mission earning millions of dollars per drop and one of your fronts gets attacked by a rival gang. If it’s a lower-tier shop, you might choose to sacrifice it to be destroyed instead of defending it, since in defending, you would be risking the loss of a few million dollars if you die while the cost to repair might be only $20,000. On the flip side, if it’s one of your top-tier, more expensive fronts and your hired goons at the store are dropping like flies, it might be worth risking the $10 million in your pocket to run over and save the shop to avoid paying $4 million in repairs.
That’s one of the beautiful things about Scarface -- it’s all up to how you want to play it, really. And no decision is entirely wrong.We believe quality always speaks itself….!!!

FAMM praises Tennessee Senate passing drug-free school zone reform
Senate has taken the important first step of mitigating the devastating burden of Tennessee’s drug-free school zone laws
NASHVILLE – FAMM Vice President of Policy Molly Gill released the following statement today following the Tennessee Senate’s passage of a bill to reform drug-free school zone laws (SB 2734). The bill now moves to the House, where a similar bill (HB 2517) has been advancing through the committee review process. FAMM urges the House to pass this reform and bring needed change to Tennessee.
“Drug-free school zone laws are a perfect example of ideas that sound great on paper, but fail spectacularly in execution,” Gill said. “While this law was created to keep drugs out of the hands of children, its overly broad reach has led to lengthy sentences for people the law was never intended to apply to — like Calvin Bryant, who received a 17-year sentence for a first-time drug offense at his home, not near a school and children.”
Since 2018, FAMM advocated for drug-free school zone reform in Tennessee. Stories like those of Calvin Bryant, Terrance Davis, Wayne Potee, and Sara Moore illustrate how the school zone law can dramatically increase sentences for drug offenses that are not in close proximity to schools and involve only adults.
If the bill is passed, six.Special Events

The rector, indeed, had married his first wife for the sake of a child, and his second for the child's sake. He had thus achieved a younger family so numerous that it had kept him from providing properly for Jane. It was what Tanqueray called the "consecrated immorality" of Jane's father that had set Jane free.
Tanqueray's father was a retired colonel. A man of action, of rash and inconsiderate action, he regarded Tanqueray with a disapproval so warm and generous that it left the young man freer, if anything, than Jane.

Change the way you view employees' talents, and you'll better appreciate their value
Does your organization focus too intensely on employees' weaknesses -- or worse, use belittling terms to speak about their strengths?
In the corporate world, managers routinely subject employees to performance reviews that emphasize their "areas for improvement," not their talents. The problem with this approach is that by focusing on weaknesses, organizations fail to capitalize on their employees' strengths.
To inspire exceptional performance, organizations must reverse this lens so they can better see, understand, and more effectively deploy every individual's innate drives and abilities. This means focusing on each employee's natural and unique ways of thinking, feeling, and behaving: his or her talents.
When organizations begin to emphasize talents -- and adopt a positive language to identify them, such as the 34 talent themes measured by the Clifton StrengthsFinder -- they transform conversations, relationships, and most importantly, performance, all for the better. Rather than denigrating a hard-charging employee by labeling her as "impatient," we can understand that she has powerful talents in the Activator theme. Instead of mocking Juan as a "schmoozer" or a "phony," we can recognize his talents in Winning Others Over (the Woo theme). Is Sally "bossy"? Or does she simply possess exceptional Command talents?
Terms such as "impatient," "phony," or "bossy" are what we'd call "barrier labels." They are barriers to understanding -- and to developing and celebrating -- what people naturally do best. Juan's Woo talents or Sally's Command may be untapped assets for your company. Juan very well could be your next sales star, and Sally might be management material. But are barrier labels preventing you from seeing and tapping their potential?
Try to understand barrier labels through your own experience. Jot down one of your top talent themes, or write down words or phrases that others sometimes use to compliment you, such as "He's so inspiring" or "She's a great source of information." Now, think about barrier labels that people have used to give a negative connotation to the same qualities, such as "He has his head in the clouds" or "She's such a bookworm." You'll probably find that many of your greatest talents are often negatively labeled -- and those labels don't help you make the most of your talents, do they?
The "workaholic"
Jerry, a participant in a recent strengths development program for salespeople, is a very talented Achiever. But he explained that he was also burdened with a barrier label: "workaholic." Indeed, Jerry said that even his wife, Anne, often used that negative term to describe him, especially when she felt that he wasn't spending enough time with her or their two children.
With this label in place, the only solution either of them could imagine was for Jerry to spend less time at work, which can be very difficult for an Achiever. For Jerry, less time in the office would mean fewer opportunities to accomplish things. That would make him miserable, and eventually, he would go back to working long hours. But that would, in turn, make his family miserable. Obviously, this solution was no solution.
At home after the workshop, Jerry sat down with Anne to talk about this problem. As Jerry described how his Achiever talents naturally make him think, feel, and behave, Anne experienced a revelation: Jerry's Achiever talents represent not only an exceptional ability to achieve, but also a need to achieve. He is internally driven to do more and accomplish more, and he invariably feels fulfilled by those achievements. Jerry's talents are an undeniable part of him. They cannot be "turned off"; they pull him toward opportunities to achieve.
Enlightened by this discovery, Jerry and Anne forged a plan. Jerry would now look for opportunities to achieve at home. How? For starters, two nights a week, he would help get the kids bathed and ready for bed -- no small achievement. And each week, the couple would make a list of at least three family activities for the weekend, such as bike rides or trips to the grocery store. Jerry's assignment was to make these activities happen. This arrangement was perfect for him; checking off the items on his family's "to do" list gave him a real sense of achievement as a father and a husband.
Jerry has applied an additional tactic. By starting his day an hour earlier and answering crucial e-mails before the family gets up, many mornings he can have breakfast with them. And now that Anne sees Jerry's Achiever talents as an asset, she is much more understanding and flexible and more interested in Jerry's work. She no longer sees him as a "workaholic." Instead, she sees him as an Achiever -- both at home and at work.
It's no coincidence that Jerry reports being more productive and engaged at work. With the balance between home and work restored, he now sees a long-term future with his company, and he no longer feels pangs of guilt when he has to work extra-long days.
The "gossip"
Claire is another example. During a management program, she realized she had been dealing with a barrier label. Claire's manager, Sue, had long ago labeled her the "group gossip." It was a running joke at the office, and Claire had fun with it as well. Then the group took the Clifton StrengthsFinder and discovered each of their top five talent themes. For Claire, Communication is number one.
When Sue learned about Claire's top theme, she said, "Now I understand why you are always talking with others -- and more importantly, I see how I can use that to help all of us stay connected." After their discussion, Sue started briefing Claire every Monday on key messages that needed to be shared with the group. Both Claire and Sue love this arrangement, and the team is more informed than ever.
Looking beyond barrier labels allows managers to tap a vast amount of underused potential in their employees. So the next time you place a barrier label on an employee -- or on yourself -- ask yourself a couple of important questions: "What is really driving that behavior?" and "How could that behavior be used in a positive way?" That is the first step to inspiring greater performance.Where a prisoner of Cambodian origin has brought suit over his dismissal from an institutional employment program, a defense motion to dismiss must be denied as to an equal protection count and allowed as to claims of due process and cruel and unusual punishment.

VTI test data on the behavior of the heated rod temperatures in the partially uncovered VVER-440 core model were simulated with RELAP5/MOD3.2.2GAMMA to assess the code, especially its heat transfer models for modeling phenomena in the partially uncovered core under Small Break LOCA conditions. This problem addresses the phenomena of high importance to VVER-440 safety.
Series of the experiments have been carried out in the VVER-440 loop model at the VTI Test Facility which are directly related to this issue. Two tests conducted in the stationary conditions with the transition mode of a steam flow in the core channel were chosen for the assessment calculations with the code.
Experimental VVER-440 loop model includes the models of all the main elements of a reactor, loop's hot leg model and cold leg simulator, and also a steam generator simulator with an active heat removal. The fuel assembly model consists of 19 electrically heated rod simulators of 9.1 mm outer diameter and 2.5 m heated height. The rod simulators are composed in the rod bundle in a hexagonal array with a pitch equal 12.2 mm (P/D=1.34).
First a study of the effect of the hydraulic nodalization to the code results was performed using different number of hydraulic volumes for the core model. After the choice of proper nodalization and maximum user-specified time step, the base case calculations were done for the tests. The differences between the code predictions for the behavior of rod's wall temperatures and test data are described and analyzed.
Sensitivity studies were carried out to investigate the influence of an increase in the calculated coefficients of heat transfer from the heated rods to a steam flow on the axial distribution of rod's wall temperatures in the uncovered part of core model.The Vampire Killers

Authorities have confirmed there were no life-threatening injuries to any of the 53 passengers, but the driver has been arrested for reckless driving.
Virginia State Police are still calling the investigation "ongoing," but so far the crash is being blamed on driver Qilong Xiao of Flushing, New York putting the hammer down a little too hard.
"Due to the road conditions we're looking at speed as being the main factor," said Sargent Les Tyler of the VA State Police. Apparently the police were having trouble finding an English speaker among the passengers, which was slowing their interview investigations.
WUSA9 reports that the crash took place around 4am today, around mile marker 137 in Stafford County, Virginia shutting down the southbound side of I-95.
The bus was a 2005 Van Hool, on a run from New York City to Doraville, Georgia.

Not very good, it's just not funny.
Also forgot to mention: the two cops in the photo montage were played by Bill Lawrence and producer Randall Winston (who was the hook-handed security guard on Scrubs).
I haven't seen the pilot yet, but I liked this episode. The slightly desperate undertone gives it an edge that's unusual and makes it stand out a little.
I'm intrigued, and Courtney's vulnerability is appealing.
I liked the pilot, but gave up on this one at the first commercial break. Don't know if I'll be back.
I found it enjoyable enough. It had me laughing out loud once or twice. It also made me a little hopeful for the future of the show - it isn't just about Cox cougaring it up, but instead about trying to recapture her lost youth.
You can only have so many plots in which she bangs a 20 year old, but having that just be a symptom, for her, of something she missed opens up a lot more doors.
I liked this episode MUCH more than the first. She became someone I can root for -- someone who missed out on her youth and is now trying to make up for what she missed. Not in a sad way, but in the way of an underdog who is not great at it but tries anyway.
The title is still awful. And Bill Lawrence's wife is still awful as well. But better than the first.
My beef is completely unfair, but I was distracted by the fact that the sets and locations were different - different street, different house, different office. Otherwise, I liked it, and I loved seeing Bill and Randall as cops. I wonder if Ellie's baby is the youngest Lawrence child?
I like this show. While I'm completely different demographically from the title character (27, m, asian), there's definitely something about the character that can resonate. This isn't a sad character - as Alan notes in his review, this is a self-aware character who is trying to sort out ... well, I can't think of the right way to put it now, so the meaning of life, basically, for her. There's a lot of stuff they can explore.
I haven't read BL's updates on the show, but yeah, I did think this show seemed slightly geared towards a male's take, so it'll be interesting to see what the influence of the female writers are to the show.
The son seems alright, but there's really a lack of something there. HE's too similar to Courtney Cox in mannerism, imo, and the problem is, with Cox, there's an inherent reason that has been clearly stated and explained - a middle-aged woman trying to find herself. They need to spend some backstory on the son.
I'm not sure I really care for the purpose of Barb's character, which seems, right now, like a warning sign for Jules to not go down that road. Busy Phillips character could show a bit more work as well - she is working, and she should have other interests than being the raging party girl. This is, though, only the 2nd episode.
Ex-husband needs some background depth. I thought the war stories would give us a peek perhaps, as he was off partying 45 days while Jules was pregnant? There's a lot that can be explored there without veering into Jay Mohr/Paula Marshall Gary UnMarried cheesy (and I sorta like that show, but it is quite cheesy at times).
I like Christa Miller. I fear, though, like Callie Thorne, that both women are somewhat typecast, which makes this worse, since BL is her husband. But whereas Callie Thorne seems to be the sexed up milf these days (she had a guest stint on Royal Pains where she was the horny older lady), Christa has sort of been playing the crazy cougar for awhile that I hope they give her character more than just a sidekick role, more than Robin to Batman. They can explore a middle-aged married woman's pains and concerns without delving into crazy cougar persona.
If there's a concern I have, it's that the show will throw Grayson and Jules together at some point. It just ... feels like there's a shot that can happen, and I hope it doesn't. They need to find that banter in b/w, of two people who eventually share a similar (divorcees), but far different, journey. Would love to see them add Grayson's ex-wife into the mix as well.
Okay ... do I have a problem with this show? Yes. I love Bill Lawrence. I think he's great. But ... he really doesn't do much with minorities that aren't somewhat stereotypical in some fashion. Even Turk and Carla had some stereotypical traits. There's a lot of interesting dynamics they could put into Cougar Town (not much they can do about the name anymore) involving minority middle aged people without getting ridiculous.
But overall, I really like the tone and direction of the show.
Out of the 4 new ABC Wednesday comedies this is the one I like the most.
I see potential for it if it does not concentrate on the whole "cougar" thing.
I like her crazy lazy ex-husband. Like the neighbor - paper buddy. Never been a fan of Busy Phillips but she is not too annoying.
The one thing that does distract me is her best friend (w/the baby)... what is wrong with the movement in her face?
Mostly the lower part of her face around the mouth. It just does not look natural. When she speaks it looks off. Maybe bad botox or lip injections?
cancelled it from my DVR after last night.
MONSTER!! Dang, that was awesome when they got the hubby in the garage.
Last night was the first time I watched. I thought it was funny. If I can remember to watch it next week, I might.
I think the show has potential, which is why I will keep watching for awhile. I also hope it succeeds and that they expand Barb's role because anything that gets Carolyn Hennessy off the total suck that is "General Hospital" is okay by me!
I am really enjoying this show. To me, it feels fresh-many sitcoms are so predictable. I don't feel like I know what is coming next, which is fun. Also I do have a soft spot for the actor who plays the "paper buddy", I loved him in Swingtown.
I like Cougar Town and can relate since I had a child at 20 and missed my 20's....
CC is a bit over the top as usual but I think BL can pull this sitcom off...just give him time
I almost wonder if this show would have been better off on HBO, Showtime or FX. It seems artificially toned down for its premise (the whole 10-date rule thing), in an effort to not be too controversial or offensive. Still good though.
I liked the show! I thought it was fun to see someone trying to relive their twenties. You just can't do it, once you hit your thirties and beyond. If you look back at the heart of your twenties, aren't you surprised that you actually lived through those times? I am! They were fun, but trecherous! I liked this episode!
I'm loving this show so far. Granted, I am pretty much the target audience, but it makes me lol, and that's what I want from a comedy.
Liked this one less than the Pilot, which wasn't that great to start with. But I do feel that the show has potential and I'm not yet giving up on it.
I just hope that Courteney Cox will tone it down a bit in future episodes and play it a bit more natural instead of over-the-top sitcom-y like she keeps doing now.
I watched about two minutes of this. Courtenay Cox is too hyper for me, just too much and I can't stand what's her name? you know, Dr. Cox's creepy squeeze/wife, I don't even know 'cause I record Scrubs so I can fast foward her acting. Won't be watching this at all.
I don't know what's wrong with everybody. It's not the best thing in the world, but if you're not laughing four or five times per episode I don't know what to do with you. If Busy Phillips's delivery in the pilot of "You left this at the bar, bitch!" didn't sell you, and you were impervious to "Monster!" you should probably just go watch Leno.
Of course, all you hater's needn't worry, since it's going to be cancelled because of its AWFUL name. Good one, ABC.
Am I the only guy on the planet who caught the homage to "The Truman Show"?
When Ellie's husband shows up pretending to befriend Grayson with pizza and "Penn Pavels" beer (the same fictional brand from "The Truman Show"). He even adds Noah Emmerich's tagline: "That's really good beer!
Was the 2nd episode originally shot as the pilot? Crista Miller's character was referred to as the 'best friend' rather than sister as was the case in the first episode shown (she also referred to HER aunt who broke the hip - wouldn't have been THEIR aunt) and she seemingly slept with the 20 year old (among other things) in the first episode. Now she has a 10 date rule?
No, second episode. I don't remember any sister references. And Jules says at the start of this one that she's re-instating the 10-date rule because she feels she went too fast with the young guy from the pilot.
The only way Courtney could explain her over-acting is that she's trying to make up for her (and her neighbour's) immobilized faces. Lay off the botox ladies!
She's way overdoing it and it's coming off as crazy-Monica. Which is too bad, since I think it could be good otherwise.
I would cancel it from the pvr but my husband actually likes.
I like this ok. At least it is nice to have something light and funny on. One thing that is distracting me: Cox's character is a real estate agent who doesn't seem to own her own business, with a kid and husband who earns little to nothing (and takes rather than contributes support, in any case), and she lives in virtual mansion. Does that seem off to others?
Is Jules supposed to be 40? And she had a kid at 20, yet the kid is still in high school?
she had him at 22, which still doesn't explain it. And her Paper Buddy! is still too John Dorian to me. It doesn't fit.
I'm recording it cause Bill created it, Crista's in it (she's toned Jordan down enough, but I still know it's her) and my brother circled it on the fall grid.
I need to make him watch it.
I know Once & Again was not a comedy, but the kids were only slightly embarrassed, not totally humiliated. (although I liked that the kid had the posters all over his room)
Also, comments about how awful you will look at 50... well, once you're 50, network TV doesn't care if they insult you anyway.Deaf customers filed a lawsuit against coffee giant Starbucks this week, alleging they experienced discriminatory treatment at a NYC location on multiple occasions in the last year.
Starbucks spokesperson Jaime Riley says the company is treating the allegations very seriously, and points to a blog post detailing the global coffee chain’s policy on providing a deaf-friendly environment at its locations.
Employment lawyer Derek T. Smith says small business owners don’t always establish a clear policy for workers on customer discrimination – as they spend more time focusing on discrimination and harassment within the workplace – but they should.
“Not only is discrimination illegal in the workplace amongst employees,” says Smith, “but it’s also illegal between an employee and a customer.”
Smith says most state laws provide that any place of public accommodation that discriminates against a protected class (such as race, gender, sexual orientation, age or disability) can be found liable for discriminatory behavior.
Abrams, Fensterman employment lawyer Eric Broutman agrees business owners should not overlook the issue.
“To the extent possible, you need to make accommodations to customers to allow them the free use and enjoyment of your store,” says Broutman.
Here are five tips from Smith and Broutman on how to best educate employees about discrimination.
No. 1: Formalize training.
Smith says most training focuses on internal discrimination, so make sure any formal training includes discussions on employee-customer discrimination.
“There needs to be more of a focus, because I get inquiries every week about discrimination lawsuits,” says Smith.
Broutman adds, “It needs to be discussed with every new hire, or once a year.” He says policy manuals should also be printed out and made readily available.
No. 2: Teach them what discrimination looks like.
Any training should clear up for your staff what discrimination looks like.
For instance, sexual harassment from an employee to a customer looks very different than disability discrimination. Make sure your employees understand which classes are protected, and what different scenarios might look like.
“Any time an establishment calls someone a racial slur when they get into a fight,” says Smith, it is discrimination. “Or if they treat people differently – I’ve seen cases in stores where racial profiling has occurred. African-Americans have been followed around the store, whereas white patrons have not,” says Smith.
Smith adds that employees making comments about a customer’s physical appearance can be grounds for a sexual harassment suit. By going through various scenarios and teaching employees the different faces of discrimination, Smith says employers can go far to prevent it from happening in their establishments.
No. 3: Provide reasonable accommodations.
“If anybody has a disability, they need to be accommodated in a reasonable fashion,” says Smith. “If a person in a wheelchair has difficulty getting into your store, you need to get off your [butt] and walk over, and help the person into the store.”
No. 4: Consider installing cameras.
Smith says video footage can be crucial in catching discrimination on tape – or proving that it didn’t happen. Employers who want to make sure that all customers are being treated fairly and in a way consistent with company standards may want to consider installing cameras and periodically reviewing footage.
No. 5: Enable customers to give feedback.
If an employee mistreats a customer, the best-case scenario is that the customer reports the mistreatment to the manager, who then appropriately and quickly deals with the situation. Broutman says it’s in employers’ best interests to provide opportunities that facilitate that type of communication.
“It’s important to have managerial oversight to make sure there’s compliance [with rules regarding discrimination],” says Broutman. “Allow customers an avenue to make complaints, so if there are rogue employees, you can make sure to take necessary action.”
Broutman suggests installing a call-in number, or using social media to gain feedback.

Colored popcorn is a quick & easy gift giving idea that kids can help make in the kitchen to share with family friends. Perfect for teacher gifts, scout leader gifts or Halloween party favors, they are one of the simplest candy corn crafts to create. It’s very fun!
Supplies:
3/4 cup popcorn
red food coloring
yellow food coloring
2 Ziploc lunch sized bags
1 Decorating bag used for icing (can be purchased at your local craft store)
Ribbon
Place 1/4 cup of popcorn in one bag and add 30 drops of yellow food coloring. Seal the bag, squish it around until all of the kernels are covered and let it set over night. In the other bag, place another 1/4 cup of popcorn and add in 25 drops of yellow food coloring and 8 – 10 drops of red food coloring. Seal the bag, squish it around and let it set overnight.
In the morning, open each of the bags so that the kernels will air dry; typically only a couple of hours.

What clever takes on traditional holiday foods have you made lately? Who would you gift these candy corn crafts to on Halloween?Chicken Parmesan
My husband and I are both extremely lucky to have a lot of Italian in our blood, and you can see it everyday not only through our skin tone but by our tastes in food! Last year we had gone out to eat and had the worst Chicken Parmesan we had ever had in our lives! For our anniversary that year I surprised him with this amazing Chicken Parmesan meal and we have been hooked ever since! This is another one of those meals that I just will not order out to eat anymore. It is a little time consuming, but it is worth the extra effort that it takes!
Ingredients:
- Chicken Breast - 1 pound
- Large Eggs - 4
- All Purpose Flour - 2 cups
- Salt - 1 tablespoon
- Black Pepper - 2 tablespoons
- Garlic Salt - 1 tablespoon
- Paprika - 1 tablespoon
- White Pepper - 1/2 teaspoon
- Cayenne Pepper - 1/2 teaspoon
- Seasoned Bread Crumbs - 1 to 2 cups, Panko works too!
- Butter - 2 tablespoons
- Fresh Parmesan Cheese - As desired
- Tomato Sauce - 1 jar, or homemade
- Mozzarella - As needed, shredded
- Angel Hair Pasta - 8 oz. cooked, drained
Instructions:
- Grab 3 large plates to start setting up your breading station.
- Using a hand mixer, beat eggs seasoned with a little salt and pepper until foamy. Pour into the first plate.
- In a mixing bowl combine; flour, salt, pepper, garlic salt, paprika, white and cayenne pepper. Pour mixture into second plate.
- Pour Panko or season bread crumbs into the last plate.
- Preheat your oven to 425. Add butter to casserole dish and let it melt during the preheating process. Browned butter adds a lot more flavor to this dish!
- Begin coating your chicken into each of the seasoned plates starting with the flour, next the egg mixture and lastly the breading. I like to press the breading in deep using either a fork or using gloves. My husband LOVES the extra crunch!
- Pull your casserole dish out of the oven and place the breaded chicken directly into the hot pan. Coat all of the chicken and then bake for 15-18 minutes.
- While the chicken is baking, start to warm up your spaghetti sauce and start to boil some water for the angel hair pasta.
- You'll want to put the tomato sauce directly on top of the chicken when it comes out of the oven.
- Next top with fresh mozzarella and place back into the oven for another 3-5 minutes and bump up your oven temperature to 450 or 500 so you get a nice crunch on the chicken and the mozzarella.
- Drain your pasta and serve 2-3 tenders or one chicken breast on top of the pasta. Serve with veggies of your choice!
This Chicken Parmesan recipe may seem a little time intensive, but after making it once or twice it takes no time at all!W
Not sure if trolling or trying to keep the gullible away from the punk scene. Maybe it's both.!© Josh Sager – May 2013
Since the arrest of Bradley Manning for his release of classified military cables and files, there has been a great deal of discussion over whether Manning is a traitor or a whistleblower. Many in the government and media would label Bradley Manning a traitor, simply due to the fact that he released documents that the military had labeled classified. On the other hand, numerous reporters and activists have staked the position that Manning is anything from a patriotic whistleblower to a national hero and candidate for the Nobel peace prize.
Personally, I find myself firmly on the side of Manning and those who believe that the release of the videos and cables to the press served a greater purpose. If we simply let our government label all of its crimes as “state secrets” and brush them under the rug, there is no real possibility for accountability—the public will never be told about the crimes perpetrated in their names.
In my mind, Manning is a whistleblower who, while he does deserve a discharge from the military for his actions, does not deserve to be criminally charged. His actions broke the military’s rules, but they improved the public’s knowledge of things that had been hidden to avoid embarrassing the powerful and have exposed war-crimes.
To illustrate just what separates Manning from an actual traitor, I will use the example of William Colton Millay, a US army MP who attempted to sell secrets to the Russians in 2011. Through comparing and contrasting the cases of Manning and Millay, I hope that I can make clear to those who would condemn Manning just why they are wrong in calling Manning a traitor to the United States.
The Traitor: William Colton Millay
Labeling somebody a traitor is a loaded term but, in this case, it is one that is both entirely factual and entirely fair. William Colton was caught attempting to sell military secrets, confessed to his crimes, and has been sentenced to 16 years in jail—given this, there is no doubt that he is, in fact, a traitor to the USA.
William Colton Millay, 24, was stationed in Alaska as a military police officer (MP) with the 164th Military Police Company when he attempted to contact Russian officials with an offer to spy on the United States.
Millay is a white-supremacist, as proven by literature recovered from his possessions and the fact that he had several tattoos associated with neo-Nazis. While we don’t know many specifics of his personal grievance with the USA, he openly displayed disgust with the US government during his meetings with the FBI and stated that he had no problem causing the deaths of American soldiers, just as long as he receives money.
During the summer months of 2011, Millay made several attempts to contact Russian officials, at least one of which was noticed by the FBI and acted on with a sting operation. In September of 2011, FBI agents impersonating Russian intelligence agents set up a meeting with Millay, during which they recorded his discussing terms to sell US military secrets to the Russians.
In exchange for monetary compensation, Millay offered to sell technical secrets of the Warlock Duke anti-IED system for military vehicles and the F-22 Fighter Jet, as well as confidential information about base personnel (easily accessible for him due to his MP position). While Millay openly displayed his dislike of the US government, he even offered to re-enlist for five more years if the Russians agreed to pay him a significant sum.
After this meeting, the FBI set up a drop point for money and information. Still unaware that he was part of a sting, Millay dropped classified technical information about the Warlock Duke system and picked up $3,000 in cash and a disposable cell phone.
The FBI arrested Millay in October and held him for 10 days before formally charging him with a variety of crimes, including: attempted espionage, soliciting another to commit espionage and communicating national defense information. Just these crimes—disregarding the other lesser charges Millay was facing—could carry a sentence of life in prison.
In April 2013, Millay was sentenced to 16 years in a military prison, stripped of his rank, and forfeited all monetary compensation for his military service.
The Patriotic Whistleblower: Bradley Manning
Bradley Manning is a US Army Private who released a tremendous number of classified documents to the press and to the site Wikileaks in 2010. Manning’s document release led to his arrest and detainment by the US military, under a variety of charges.
As an intelligence analyst with access to massive quantities of confidential information, Manning had easy access to the information that he would later leak to the press; he simply loaded the cables onto a removable SD card for his personal camera and walked off of the base with the information.
After leaving the base with the information, Manning attempted to contact numerous print publications, including the New York Times and the Washington Post. For unknown reasons, both of these publications declined to accept the information and Wikileaks was the only one to take an interest in Manning’s documents. We simply don’t know what the exchanges between Manning and Wikileaks consisted of (or even if he talked to Assange), but the result of these discussions was Wikileaks’ posting of the information on their site.
While many of the documents released by Manning were benign, some exposed extremely embarrassing exchanges between world governments and a few included evidence of terrible misconduct by the United States government.
Of the more egregious things exposed by these leaked documents, videos of American attack choppers killing unarmed civilians in Iraq (the “collateral murder” videos”) and communications discussing the torture program of detainees were probably the most embarrassing to the US government. These files had been covered up by the government because of their damaging nature and nobody knew about the true extent of this misconduct.
Manning’s access to confidential information led him to be exposed to facts that made him extremely disenchanted with the Iraq War. He believed that the revelation of crimes that were hidden from the public—like the American Air Force’s killing of civilian reporters or the Iraqi president’s use of American military power to suppress his political opposition as terrorists–would better allow Americans to assess the war in general.
In his online discussions with his friend Adrian Lamo (a hacker who would later turn him in), Manning discussed his reasoning for leaking the information to the press. Manning was directly asked by Lamo why he wasn’t selling this tremendously valuable information and was simply offering it to the media. In response, Manning stated that selling the information would make him a “slimy intel collector” and that “if its out in the open… it should be a public good.”
Rather than selling this extremely damaging information to interested groups to make huge amounts of money, Manning gave the information away because he believed that it would be a social good; people would be able to see the true actions of their government and would be better able to make choices in public policy.
At the time of his arrest in 2010, Private Manning was detained in the brig at Quantico. For 11 months after his arrest, Manning was held in solitary confinement under “suicide watch,” despite the fact that nobody thought that he was suicidal. Manning spent these 11 months in a 6×12 windowless cell, barred from exercising, stripped of his clothing, and denied any contact with the outside world.
The conditions endured by Manning are classified by our government, as well as civil rights groups, to be forms of “non-touch torture” that are banned by international agreements. In March 2012, the UN confirmed that their investigation indicated that Manning was suffering from “cruel and inhumane treatment” at the hands of the US military.
After months of being held, Manning was arraigned in a military court on 22 different charges in February 2012. Of these charges, the most serious is that of “Aiding the Enemy,” which carries a potential death sentence.
In February 2013, Bradley Manning entered a naked plea (a plea without a sentencing deal), confessing to 10 of the 22 charges alleged against him. Despite this plea, the military is going along with the trial and is attempting to convict him under the Espionage Act and of Aiding the Enemy. At this point, it appears that Manning will not be given the opportunity to plead out and will be facing either life in prison or the death penalty.
What Separates the Two?
Now that we have gone over the basic facts of both the Bradley Manning and William Colton Millay, we can start comparing and contrasting the two. I don’t think that anybody argues that Millay isn’t a traitor, and I seek to use this agreement to illustrate the case as to why Manning is nothing like a common traitor—he is, in fact, a patriotic whistleblower.
The differences between the Manning and Millay cases are extraordinary, not just in what the individuals did, but also in the government’s response to the two leakers.
The Offenses
A superficial view of the cases of Manning and Millay might lead some to conclude that they committed similar crimes—they both distributed classified material to foreign nationals, in violation of secrecy laws and their orders from superior officers—but, in reality, the cases are actually very different.
First of all, the material released was dramatically different in both cases. Manning released diplomatic communications and videos of American soldiers killing civilians, while Millay conspired to release technical documents for the US Army’s anti-IED measures. Revealing evidence of war crimes serves a vital societal interest (ensuring that the government isn’t covering up violations of the laws of war), while selling one government’s weapon specs to another is simply espionage.
The information released by Manning may be embarrassing and a threat to those in command of the soldiers who killed civilians, but it is not a danger to the troops on the ground; in fact, this information had no legitimate reason to be classified and is simply a case of the military covering up war crimes (killing civilians). To this day, not even those trying Manning in court are able to point to a single death caused by his actions.
In contrast with the information that Manning released, Millay was intending to expose to foreign powers the technical specifications of life-saving military technology. If information about the Warlock Duke anti-IED system were leaked, it would be much more likely that terrorists and foreign powers would be able to counteract the system and deliver IEDs successfully onto our vehicles. Such a leak puts the lives of innumerable soldiers in danger and has no purpose beyond enriching the leaking party.
Second, the motives of Manning and Millay couldn’t possibly be more different: Manning leaked his information in an attempt to improve government accountability, while Millay attempted to leak his information to get rich quick.
A person who sells secrets for a profit is a spy, while a person who gives secrets away in furtherance of exposing a crime is a whistleblower.
Manning put himself at dire risk, with no hope of a personal gain, just to expose the terrible things happening in Iraq and he is a textbook example of a whistleblower—in any fair system, he would be shielded from criminal consequences (but not discharge from the military) by the Whistleblower Protection Act. Just as Daniel Ellsberg exposed war crimes during the Vietnam War with his release of the Pentagon Papers, Bradley Manning exposed war crimes during the Iraq War.
In fact, Daniel Ellsberg himself is a supporter of Bradley Manning and an advocate for his classification as a whistleblower.
William Colton Millay attempted to sell secrets for cash—there is little to say to this other than it is both illegal and a violation of his oaths to our military. In exchange for a payday, Millay was willing to put his fellow soldiers in danger by leaking information that could be used to harm them. Unlike Manning, Millay is the textbook example of a traitor.
Third, the recipient of the leaked information was different: Bradley Manning attempted to leak his information to numerous news sources, while Millay attempted to leak his information to a foreign power.
Providing evidence of military crimes to press organizations, whether the organization is the New York Times or Wikileaks, is the exact opposite of leaking secrets to another country’s military.
Giving the US military’s technological secrets to a foreign power gives a strategic advantage to the foreign military and risks leaks to non-governmental enemies. Such leaks don’t serve to improve accountability and serve no societal good that makes them protected under the law.
On the other hand, whistleblowers who leak evidence of the government’s wrongdoing to the press are providing a societal good and are protected under the Whistleblower Protection Act. The press exists to increase accountability to the government and a free press depends upon sources like Manning in order to report on the true actions of those in power.
Actually, the most amazing thing about this situation is not that Wikileaks published Manning’s leaked documents, but that the New York Times and Washington Post refused to. These leaks were incendiary, but they were also highly reputable in their provenance (there is no doubt as to the legitimacy of the information) and they represented a very large news story. The refusal of these “reputable” news sources to report on the crimes revealed in Manning’s leaks speaks volumes about how far the media has fallen from its station as the thing that keeps government honest.
Pre-trial Detainment
After being caught disseminating classified information and being accused to traitorous activity, both Manning and Millay were held in the custody of the United States Armed Services on military bases. Given the similarities in their supposed crimes and the fact that they were being accused by the same administration, one would assume that they would have been held in similar conditions and for similar amounts of time—this assumption would be wrong.
William Colton Millay was taken into custody in late October 2011 and was charged after ten days of uncharged detainment. He was afforded every right of an American service member accused of a crime and was held in the brig at Joint Base-Lewis McChord in Washington State.
As previously mentioned, Bradley Manning was arrested in 2010 and had his rights severely violated by the US military. Originally held at the military base in Kuwait, Manning was transferred back to the USA in July 2010 to await trial. While at Quantico, Manning was held in solitary confinement for 10 months and was subjected to inhumane treatment (nudity, isolation, constant light, etc.).
In addition to being subjected to inhumane treatment, Manning was detained before being charged for over 400 days—the military’s own regulations mandate that all accused soldiers must be charged in fewer than 120 days, as they have the right to a “speedy trial.” When the Manning legal team attempted to have the charges dismissed based upon this violation of Manning’s rights, a military judge rejected the argument and offered a sealed judgment (a legally binding ruling by a judge, where the public has access to the ruling but not the reasoning behind the ruling) that allowed the charges to be sustained.
Disregarding the argument that Manning is a whistleblower rather than a traitor, the military clearly treated him in a manner that is unusually harsh even for those accused of treason. After all, Millay was accused of treason by the very same military that was persecuting Manning, yet Millay never suffered in solitary or got stripped down every night.
Manning was treated far worse than others accused of similar crimes and it is important that we question just why this happened.
In my opinion, Manning was treated so badly by the military for the simple reason that he exposed their crimes to the world and embarrassed the powerful. Millay may have tried to sell secrets that could kill soldiers on the ground, but his leaks did nothing to threaten or embarrass those giving the orders—it is this key distinction that led those in power to throw the book at Manning, while they simply treated Millay as a simple criminal.
The Trials
The Bradley Manning trial has been an exercise in government secrecy and abusive over-sentencing by prosecutors.
Bradley Manning is facing numerous charges, the most severe being an “Aiding the Enemy” charge that could carry a death sentence. The use of this charge is the very definition of prosecutorial overreach, as there is no way to argue that leaking information to the media can be considered leaking it to an enemy force. The media is an instrument of accountability, not an enemy entity, and the simple fact that they may report on leaked information of crimes—thus informing everybody, including enemies of the USA—does not allow the military to charge leakers with this capital offense.
In support of this charge, the military is seeking to introduce evidence from the Bin Laden compound that Bin Laden read press reports from our media about the Wikileaks. In introducing this evidence, the military is trying to say that the fact that an enemy of the USA was able to read about the leaked information in our press is equivalent to Manning giving the information directly to Bin Laden. This argument is patently absurd and has huge accountability ramifications.
Charging Manning with aiding the enemy under this justification is the exact equivalent to charging Daniel Ellsberg with the offense, simple because the Viet Cong may have had access to a copy of the New York Times. Unfortunately, the country’s security apparatus is far larger and more powerful now than it was then, and leakers have begun to face charges that would have been inconceivable in previous generations.
If an investigator or leaker can be charged with a capital crime for providing information to the press about war crimes that have been covered up by being labeled classified, then the military can simply annihilate accountability. They simply need to classify all of their crimes, and charge anybody who dares report them with a crime that can send them to the death chamber.
Like Manning, Millay faced numerous charges, but nobody ever considered charging him with an “Aiding the Enemy” offense. This disparity is particularly telling because Millay fits the offense of aiding the enemy far closer than Manning ever did—he leaked documents that compromise vital technology to a foreign power, while Manning released evidence of crimes to the mass media.
If you are willing to charge somebody who leaked evidence of war crimes to the media with aiding the enemy, what possible justification is there for not charging a man who leaked technical information to a foreign power? Put plainly, Manning released things that embarrassed the government and they want to punish him in order to set an example for future leakers.
This is supported by the fact that, after several months of trial, Millay was allowed to plead out on lesser offenses while Manning attempted to do the same and was blocked. Manning has actually admitted to his “crimes” and has entered a naked plea (an admission without a sentencing deal) that could result in his imprisonment for decades, yet the government is still pursuing the top charges. The fact that they won’t let him plead to lesser offenses and go to sentencing indicates that the military wants to make an example of Manning and send him to jail for life or to kill him.
If Millay, who sold out his country for money, can plead down to 16 years for his offense, what justification is there for pursuing life without parole of death for Manning? The military’s prosecution of Manning is not only wrongheaded, but it is unusually harsh even if one considers Manning a traitor—as demonstrated by the disparities between the treatment of Manning and an actual traitor.
Conclusion
If there were any justice, Manning would receive a full pardon from the government and be let free today. Unlike the traitorous William Colton Millay, Manning risked everything to become a whistleblower in an attempt to better inform all of us as to the conduct of our government. He may not be able to stay in the military after his leaking of classified information, but he does not deserve to rot in jail simply for exposing the inconvenient truth that our government committed war crimes.
Ironically, while Manning is on trial for his leaking of evidence of war crimes, none of the people who committed those crimes, tortured detainees, or lied us into war have ever seen the inside of a jail cell. Apparently, we can “look forward, not backward” for all crimes, but the terrible and capital crimes of embarrassing the powerful and exposing government misconduct.

Colorado state lawmakers, their staffers and the journalists who cover them at the Capitol received early access to COVID-19 vaccines this month.
The state sent 240 doses of COVID-19 vaccine to UCHealth to vaccinate legislators and their staff, although the governor’s office does not know how many actually received the shots, said Conor Cahill, spokesman for Gov. Jared Polis.
“The legislature is very much part of our COVID response and the legislature’s ability to safely conduct the legislative session as soon as possible is necessary to our state’s successful COVID response and recovery,” Cahill said in an email. “The United States Congress in Washington, D.C., was similarly offered the vaccine.”
The state health department again revised its phased rollout out of COVID-19 vaccines Friday, creating and expanding another subgroup within Phase 1. Educators were moved up in prioritization as were people aged 65 to 69. They will begin getting vaccinated Feb. 8.
The state created a Phase 1B.2 that includes those people in their late 60s. teachers and some members of the executive and judicial branches of the state government, who are included in this subgroup as they are considered essential for “continuity of state government.”
But state legislators already received access to the vaccine, ahead of resuming their session next month. State officials decided in December to go ahead and inoculate lawmakers after guidance from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to “ensure continuity of state government in their vaccine planning,” Cahill said.
Across the U.S., other state lawmakers also have received early doses of COVID-19 vaccines, including in Missouri and Texas.
House Speaker Alec Garnett, D-Denver, said “the No. 1 priority is nonpartisan staff” when it comes to vaccinations at the state Capitol because they do work that puts them in contact with others.
The vaccine also was offered to 22 journalists covering the legislature, including two reporters from The Denver Post, the week of Jan. 11, Cahill said.
Tim Regan-Porter, chief executive officer of the Colorado Press Association, said those reporters work inside the Capitol and are around a large pool of people, which puts them at risk of contracting the novel coronavirus.
“The work journalists do is essential,” he said. “A lot of that work requires journalists to be in close interaction with people in public spaces. That includes getting information out about the virus and the vaccine.”
However, other frontline journalists won’t receive the vaccine until Phase 1B.3, along with other essential workers, such as grocery store employees and manufacturing workers. That’s expected to happen in March.
“From our standpoint, the sooner we can get our journalists vaccinated the better,” Regan-Porter said.

The senior insisted he has learned another life lesson and his focus will be on his final year of football with the Gamecocks.
"I've just got to be smarter. That's the bottom line," Garcia said after practice Thursday. "Last time I got in trouble was three or four years ago. It was a bad decision on my part down in Atlanta. Nothing bad is going to happen again -- that's guaranteed."
Gamecocks coach Steve Spurrier suspended the senior for the first three spring practices because he broke team rules before last season's Chick-fil-A Bowl loss to Florida State. It was the third time in five springs that Garcia has missed at least part of offseason drills.
"Every single thing I've done has been my fault," Garcia said.
Garcia admitted his relationship with South Carolina fans and Spurrier has been bumpy. The quarterback learned he was suspended through a voice mail the first day of spring practice. He said he was so distraught that he couldn't call his coach back for several hours.
When he finally decided to face Spurrier, the coach gave him about a dozen suggestions on how to be a better quarterback and teammate. Top of the list was to cut his hair, and Garcia promptly went to the barber.
Garcia refused to share the rest of the list with reporters and declined to detail what he did to get suspended.
"I don't really want to get into that. It was kind of an in-house deal. I'm just going to leave it at that," Garcia said. "It was three months ago, and it is kind of distracting talking about it still."
Garcia threw five interceptions in South Carolina's final two games of 2010 -- a 56-17 loss to Auburn in the Southeastern Conference title game and a 26-17 defeat in the bowl game against Florida State. Garcia said whatever got him suspended didn't affect his performance against the Seminoles.
"I need to sleep, drink and eat football -- nothing else but football," Garcia said. "That's what I am doing. I started as soon as that game was over. That was a tough game to swallow."
Garcia has started every game the past two years, and is a candidate to be preseason all-Southeastern Conference quarterback, but he doesn't know if he'll still be the starter when the season opens Sept. 3 against East Carolina.
Spurrier has four quarterbacks taking significant snaps in spring practice, including sophomore Connor Shaw. But he said Thursday he hasn't liked how any of them looked.
"I cut practice five minutes short today. The offense basically surrendered. They couldn't make a first down against the defense," Spurrier said Thursday.
Quarterbacks coach G.A. Mangus wasn't as tough on his QBs, especially Garcia, who he said had a good offseason.
"Handle it and move on -- that's what we're doing," Mangus said of Garcia's suspension. "He's out here practicing. He paid his debt to society, whatever you want to call it, and it's time to play football and get better."Florence + the Machine is the recording name of English musician Florence Welch and a collaboration of other artists who provide music for her voice. This biography ‘the machine’..The political arm of the Florida Medical Association (FMA PAC) is supporting Rep. Shevrin Jones as he attempts a move to the Senate in 2020.
Jones is one of six Democrats competing in the Senate District 35 primary. Jones has represented House District 101 for eight years and is term-limited from seeking that seat again.
“The FMA has worked closely with Rep. Jones over his eight years in the Florida House on healthcare issues,” said Doug Murphy, president of the FMA PAC. “He is a true friend of medicine and we are honored to endorse him for Senate District 35. We look forward to continuing our work with him in the Senate on critical medical issues in our state.”
The FMA is one of the state’s largest pro-medicine groups and represents medical and osteopathic physicians throughout Florida. The group’s political arm was set up in 1974 and offers endorsements to members of both parties.
The newest endorsement isn’t the only assist Jones has received from the health care sphere as of late. Earlier this month, Jones announced he had tested positive for COVID-19. On Thursday, more than two weeks later after that diagnosis, Jones said he had recovered and tested negative for the novel coronavirus.
“This ongoing public health crisis underscores the important role our health care providers play in keeping communities healthy, safe, and strong,” Jones added in a statement.
“I’m honored to have the support of the hardworking doctors who are putting in long hours on the frontlines to provide high quality care for Floridians.”
Jones is competing for the SD 35 Democratic nomination against former Sen. Daphne Campbell, former firefighter Wilbur Harbin, Miami Gardens Councilman Erhabor Ighodaro, former Rep. Cynthia Stafford and outgoing Rep. Barbara Watson.
That primary contest will take place on Aug. 18. The winner will be heavily favored in the Democratic-leaning district. Write-in candidate Darien Hill has qualified, but no Republicans will appear on the ballot.
SD 35 spans parts of Miami-Dade and Broward counties including Miami Gardens, West Park and Miramar.The view out of Gorham's Cave in Gibraltar, where traces of the last known Neandertals have been recovered. Image: Kate Wong for Neandertals for thousands of years when climate change rendered the northerly parts of their range uninhabitable. But eventually they could no longer hang on and Neandertals as a distinctive human group went extinct.
I had spent the day exploring the Neandertal stomping grounds along the coast of the southern tip of Iberia with a group of paleoanthropologists, archaeologists and ecologists who had come to Gibraltar to attend a human evolution conference, and Gorham’s was our final stop. After viewing the cave’s archaeological deposits we were treated to a live performance. Ecologist Doug Larson of the University of Guelph pulled out his guitar and performed a song he wrote about the last Neandertal, called "Last Man Standing." It was incredibly moving to hear this song while at the Neandertals' final outpost looking out over the turquoise sea to the north coast of Africa, to think about the demise of our cousins who endured longer than our own kind has existed. Filmmaker David Valentine spontaneously captured the moment on video, which you can watch below.

Beg the sun to warm my back

the last man standing
wonderin, wonderin,
I can recall the land was ours,
I can recall the many hours
I spent chipping at the stone,
now there’s nothin left nothing left but bones
We were hundreds just last year,
then the cold came and the fear
We saw Africa across the straight

See our mark upon the land, see my footprints in the sand

I don’t know what to say.
Loved the original, thought the sequel was so-so and hate the idea of someone other than Russell playing Snake but it could work out depending on script.
I’m hoping for Olyphant. I can’t think of one movie I haven’t liked him in.
Of the names mentioned, I am with you.
Didn’t we already have a remake of sort of Escape from New York with Lockout?? Don’t get me wrong, I loved Lockout, and thought it was great. If Guy Pierce played Snake, it could work. Less wise cracks than Lockout, but he can play a good tough guy.
The Rock would be a good choice, or Jason Statham. Please no Vin Diesel or Jeremy Renner.
I never saw Lockout but I thought it resembled Fortress more than Escape From New York.
@ Dazz
Check out Lockout if you get a chance. Pierce makes the movie go. It’s a throw back to 80’s action flicks to some degree. I really enjoyed it. Very “Escape from New York” like.
I think I’d prefer a new face to the actors you named. But I’m totally with you in selecting against Diesel and Renner: Diesel’s too stiff/wooden and Renner’s way too diminutive.
@ Royal
That’s a good idea, a new face would be good.
Timothy Olyphant is a good choice! Put an eye patch on him, lenthen his hair, and you’ve got Snake Plissken all over again!
Does John Carpenter have a say in this?
Not a ‘say’ exactly, but he has given his blessing to seeing another actor in the role.
He should at least be the producer.
He should at least compose the score.
Um, so what would the title be; ‘The Pre-Escape From New York’??
How about ‘Prison Max-New York’ or ‘Prison City’ or ‘The Big Apple Prison’?
Wait I know ‘Prison-verse Center’ no.. ‘Gotham Prison!’ No, Silver Pictures signed a deal with Universal for distribution. Pity it wasn’t Warner Brothers…
Made that Post-Obama US instead of Post Apocalypse US.
It would be interesting to see.
Snake angry that the Republicans wouldn’t let Obama fulfil his promises and stupid people rioting and mad at Obama like he’s the only voice in the Senate and House of Representatives?
That what you meant?
LOL
All States are evil and achieve their goals through violence, no matter what form they take or who’s in charge of them. Hypocrites, all of them.
As soon as I saw this story, all I could think of was Josh Holloway. He seems to be a younger version of Kurt Russell anyway, so why not?
I see it. Holy cow! Visually, Holloway’s got the look. And based on his performance on LOST, he’s got the right swagger too. Good call.
I think manu Bennett or scott adkins would be perfect as snake.
If it doesn’t follow Snake, not interested. I think a ton of these remakes are useless, but this idea is fine. I own and still enjoy the “Escape” movie, but we are not on sacred ground here. This could improve on the original in most every way.
Except the starring role. Sorry, Mr. Today’s Actor, but there are very few actors who can carry a role and chew up a scene the way Kurt Russell can.
Escape from New York is one of my favourite films ever, cant Hollywood not just leave a classic alone. I suppose it’s all about money, I’d watch another sequal / prequal but Snake has to be the right actor – for me Tim olyphant is not that man, renner and diesel would be massive error of judgement. Bale and butler would also be mistakes and hardy is already in mad max so options are limited, if the duke is in a prequal that’s got to be Jamie fox!!
Dude, they’re not gonna go back and change the originals like Lucas and Spielberg, so just don’t even start with that whiny “ruining the original” s**t. Okay?
And you know this how??? Are you an insider?? Why would they remake or prequel a movie that most people have never heard of that is a ‘cult classic’?? Cult meaning that it has a handful of hardcore fans. Oh, and I can say what the f**k I like and yes this is ruining the original BIG TIME but Hollywood already tainted the original with a awful sequel.
Norman reedus would be the perfect snake!! That has to happen
Wasn’t Lockdown the prequel?
And Guy Pierce is definetely the guy to be new Snake!
Josh Holloway for Snake, think about it??..yea your welcome
Jeremy Renner, he’s awesome in everything
As cringe-worthy as all most of these reboots sounds I fear the day I read about a Twilight reboot……….
How many more John Carpenter movies are left to remake? He’s one of my favorites. Keep them coming.
Big Trouble in Little China!! Who’s with me?!
Everybody relax, I’m here. You know what Ol’ Jack always says……what the hell.
Your comment. I liked it.
God bless you!
Assault on Precinct 13, Halloween, The Fog, The Thing “reboot” (which itself was a remake), and now Escape from New York. Next comes Big Trouble in Little China, and Prince of Darkness (with Alice Cooper)!
The Thing was prequel, so they are almost done except for Big Trouble In Little China and They Live. Problem with making those movies today is that they lose context because the climate is different and people don’t get some of the subtext of Carpenter’s films.
They do live…. Put on your glasses, Obama is an alien…
The Thing was definitely a “remake-prequel” hybrid.
Big Trouble in Little China! Oh, yeah! Always wanted a sequel to that.
Oh no they can stay away with that one
i loved the old movies….i wouldnt mind seeing a modern interpertaion of the movies, i think gerard butler wouldve been a great choice given how well i liked his action movies….also maby the actor who played conan the barbarian in the new remake would be a grat choice also
To the dude who said Norman Reedus: As cool as that sounds, that character would be too close to Darryl on TWD
definitely true, but it shows he can play that type of character and people like it. he can still change the character so that its not the same. do a little of that..acting thing they do. its almost like practice. i would rather see him then jeremy renner.and i think he coud use a killer break out roll… besides, tons of actors get cast in similar roles because they are good at them. that kid from chronicle is playing basically a higher profile roll of the same type of character in amazing spiderman 2…everything bruce willis, sam jackson, or jason statham has been in haha …among others…
Eddie Murphy?
How about pay me $5 million cash for the first movie, I’ll play Snake.
I know this is a bad choice but when I was watching John Carter for the first time a few weeks ago (such a terrible movie), I thought his voice was a little similar to Snake’s.
That sort of gruff, badass voice that you#d need for an ex-military man like Plissken.
How about Taylor Kitsch as Snake
Yeah that’s what I was saying, I forgot the actor’s name though when I posted.
It could work, right?
Who is asking for a trilogy of this. Leave the classics alone!
As long as they don’t remake Big Trouble in Little China, I’ll be okay.
Ha ha, or Tango & Cash
I can’t wait to find out why they thought he was dead
Enough with the re-boots and remakes already… Is that the only idea the exec’s have at te moment, are they so risk averse that no new ideas are getting through?Homespun Happy Traum's Guitar Building Blocks: Fingerpicking 3 (DVD)

Recently, I read an article in Forbes that states that one of the reasons why companies lose their top talent is poor annual performance reviews. It sounds not so surprising because many companies do not perform their annual performance reviews effectively. Typically, organizations follow the formal process where an HR would spend a month or more to get the feedback from employees and do the performance reviews just as a formality.
This makes the organizations’ talent pool feel disrespected and dishonored. Sparks a feeling that the company is not bothered about their career or future?
I strongly feel that it is better to keep away from annual performance reviews. Follow a performance management system, which constantly keeps your employees in touch with managers or coaches. Communication between them should be a continual and an ongoing process; it should not be just meeting or discussing once in a year. Review meetings need to happen regularly and the progress, failures or any obstacles that is hindering the employees’ performance needs to be discussed. The Performance Management System should be such that employees’ performance and their interests are monitored on a regular basis.
In order to implement an effective performance management process at your workplace, train your managers along with your employees. This performance management is a collaborative process between the employee and the manager. For example, it is the employees’ responsibility to ensure a review meeting happens and it’s the mangers job to conduct it. Employees and managers need to know their roles and responsibilities in this collaborative process. Training on performance management lets your employees’ goals and objectives align with those of the organization. This can greatly contribute to retain the talent pool.
Such training may not need huge investments. The online learning mode can keep the costs low. Moreover, training via eLearning does not take your employees away from productive work hours; this method is always available and can be used to train large numbers of employees within a short time frame.

Have a math, science, or engineering degree? NASA's posted a job listing you should really have a look at. Oh, and I almost forgot: you should also be open to the idea of space travel.
Every 2-4 years, NASA recruits a new crop of astronauts to add to its corps of highly trained spaceflyers, who prepare to conduct missions on the International Space Station. On Tuesday, the Agency began accepting applications for its 21st class of astronauts.
And according to NASA chief Charlie Boden, individuals selected in this pool of recruits will not only get to spend time on the ISS (getting to and from the station via new models of commercial spacecraft); they'll also be among the first spaceflyers to leave low Earth orbit since the Apollo program:
"Some of the astronauts we're recruiting today will be pioneers in our missions to make the first footprints on the surface of Mars," said Boden in a briefing on Tuesday.

were born to run. One prominent Nairobi resident attempted the Standard Chartered
Marathon last Sunday after a night of merry-making and conquered the 42km course
in six hours.
He celebrated
his achievement at his local pub after the race and reported to work on Monday.
His biggest quarrel with the organisers of
the marathon is that there is no record to show that he completed the course.
Nobody timed him, or declared his final position.
He
has, however, vowed to be back next year.
The
field next year will be well well over 10,000, up from the 4,800 who took part
in the inaugural edition.
The
Nairobi Marathon was a spectacular success. The young and old, including legislator
Danson Mungatana, braved the chill and shower to compete in the full marathon,
the 10km road race and 2.5km family fun run.
The
top runners totalled 100. Their presence spiced up competition and the eventual
winner, Philip Kirui, who earned Sh500,000, also earned a ticket to one of the
big summer races – London, Boston or Rotterdam.
However,
the top runners are not the essence of a marathon. A city marathon is a carnival
that brings out the determined, cheered on by millions.
The
New York City Marathon, held a few hours after the Nairobi Marathon, saw 34,703
athletes take to the streets, passing through the five boroughs of the city. The
last finisher was Eliza Moloka, 49 who completed the course in 9 hours 43 minutes.
She was number 34,703.
The oldest
man, 92-year-old Fauja Singh of Britain, clocked 7 hours 34 minutes, the same
time as his grand daughter Avtar Singh Tinma, 53. The oldest woman, Vivian Lowery,
79, posted 7:42.
The New York
race had 152 runners in the first race. This year there were 60,000 applicants,
26,000 were turned away.
Inquiries
on the Nairobi race from the Netherlands and Sweden were encouraging. With some
people running away from the cold weather in Europe, many fun runners will attempt
the Nairobi race next year.
Top
runners could also be interested, not because of the prize money, which compares
poorly against New York where Margaret Okayo won Sh7.8 million for finishing first
in the women's race plus Sh4.6 for breaking the course record.
They
could attempt the race simply because of Nairobi's high altitude. The city, at
1,670 metres above sea level, is the second marathon recognised by the IAAF held
that is held at high elevation after the one in Mexico.
Kirui
clocked 2 hours 15 minutes 40 seconds, but without an altitude best marathon time,
it will be hard to rank him at sea level.
His
time is 10 minutes behind Paul Tergat's world marathon record of 2:04.55. Tergat
set the record at sea level Berlin on September 28.
If
Nairobi is to attain international standards, a few flaws must be corrected. There
was not enough water for runners. Some good samaritans provided water dispensers
outside their houses along James Gichuru road.
When
people have been on the road for more than one hour, there is usually need to
answer a call of nature, and many runners stopped by the roadside, too tired to
care about their privacy. The organisers should have provided mobile washrooms
along the route.
Big city
marathon races are one big carnival. In places like Turin, church goers skip mass
to cheer on the runners with choirs and drums, if the course is next to their
churches.
Cyclists also follow
the leading runners to provide security and relay progress of the race through
two-way radio system. In Nairobi, one cyclist decided to keep Kirui company without
permission. He could have been up to no good.
Comedian
Walter Mongare also tried his antics as Kirui was only 6km from the finish by
trying to race him. Despite meet director John Velzian telling police officers
to remove Mongare from the course, they turned a blind eye.
This
is unacceptable in an international marathon run under strict IAAF rules.
Some motorists defied traffic police directives
to keep off. They misbehaved along Ngong and Mombasa roads. Such action, Velzian
said, could jeopardise the future and reputation of the marathon in presence of
independent observers.
Will
the race ever attract big names like former world record holder Khalid Khannounchi?
Opinion is divided. First, money is the motivating
factor. Alice Chelagat, a former winner of Milan marathon won Sh500,000. In New
York on the same day, Margaret Okayo won Sh12 million. But New York draws a substantial
amount of money from entry fee, which at Sh2,300 per person fetches Sh78 million.
Much more is derived from television rights sales and title sponsors. In Nairobi,
participants paid Sh200, which amounted to less than Sh1 million.
Standard Chartered Bank invested Sh27 million
and an extra 6 million was raised from co-sponsors in cash and in kind. Sh2.5
million went towards charity. Prize money in Chicago alone is 38 million.
But with an expected increment in prize money
next year some athletes would prefer running in Nairobi instead of some events
where prize money is about Sh1 million.
The
Nairobi marathon would be more lucrative for locals who must pay federal taxes,
agents commissions, meet cost of their tickets and meet ground expenses if they
compete abroad.
While Kirui
is not expected to pay taxes. Okayo surrendered 60 percent of her earnings to
the federal government (45 percent) and agent (15 percent) plus meeting the cost
of the air ticket and accommodation if she extended her stay beyond days paid
for by the meeting director. She had also stayed abroad to condition herself.
In the end her millions ended up being lose
change.
Spare a thought for
Great Lake Marathon in Kisumu. It is here Delilah Asiago clinched her first local
marathon victory last year. It is also a breeding ground for future champions.
Scheduled on December 6, meeting director
Peter Angwenyi is struggling to make ends meet. He has only Sh50,000 from a local
sponsor.
Yet in terms of potential,
Kisumu Marathon, held at a lower altitude compared to Nairobi (1,670 metres above
the sea level), could attract more foreign athletes who would boost the profile
of the race.

I've been working on an exhaustive ansi test suite for gcl. I've got
it to run under ecl. It's reporting 1542 test failures on
10785 tests.
To run the test suite, download the gcl/ansi-tests module from the
gcl cvs repository (see for directions).
Go to the ansi-tests directory, start up ecl, and enter (load "gclload.lsp").
This will load (some with compilation) various files, the execute the
tests. In at least one test the debugger is improperly invoked; just
enter :c to continue.
Instead of submitting bug reports to the sourceforge site, it's more
convenient for everyone if the maintainer(s) download and run the
test suite themselves.
This test suite is being used by various CL development teams besides
gcl to bring their lisps more fully into ANSI compliance. The test suite
does not yet cover all of the spec, but that parts that are covered
are covered in great detail. As a result, the test suite has been
finding problems that previous public tests have missed. I estimate
the test suite is about half done.

The latest additions to cvs:
* The changes to CLOS which I mentioned long ago are now in CVS. Further
improvements will probably have to wait until I come back from holidays.
* I have fixed a bug in FLOAT-DIGITS: the number of _decimal_ digits would be
output. It still remains to be fixed FLOAT-PRECISION. Does anybody know how
to retrieve this information in a portable way?
* I have ported CMUCL's FORMAT to ECL. It can be selected using
--with-cmuformat at configuration time and it shows as :CMU-FORMAT in
*features* I warn you, though, that this implementation is LARGE. It
currently adds over 60k to ECL. It is there because it is slightly better
than ECL's old routine, and because I would like to work on it making it
smaller and faster.
* A dumb FORMATTER has been implemented. It produces just a function which
calls FORMAT, and it works with and without --with-cmuformat.
I noticed that ECL no longer builds on CYGWIN. I currently haven't this
environment in my laptop and cannot check it. The problem seems to be related
to the header <inttypes.h>. Could somebody have a look at the problem?
Regards,
Juanjo
* System design:
- The bytecodes compiler now works with character arrays. Bytecodes
are thus 8 bits large, while their arguments are 16 bits large.
Lisp objects referenced in the code are kept in a separate array
to simplify garbage collection. This strategy limits the size of
bytecode objects to about 32000 bytes and about 32000 constants,
but reduces the use of memory by about 25%.
- Macros are implemented in C as functions with two arguments.
Argument checking is thus left to funcall() and apply(), saving
space (3k).
- AND, OR and WHEN are now just macros, without any special
treatment in the bytecodes compiler.

I have uploaded some changes before I go on holidays for a couple of
weeks. They are the following:
+ The GMP library and the Bohem-Weiser GC are now renamed as libeclgmp.a
and libeclgc.a, to avoid conflicts with local libraries when building
ECL. Hopefully headers will not interfere.
+ Some fixes in the compiler. I am still working on some major issues

release this summer.
+ The inliner for EXPT now produces safer code.

Definitively. First I thought there were only minor issues, but I have
discovered that the old compiler, which was thought for a very
straightforward compilation ala GCL (i.e. all functions are closures,
and there is only one class of environment), does not handle well
situations as the following one:
(lambda (a b c)
(flet ((f1 () a))
(flet ((f2 ...
(flet ((f3 ...
(f1)))
(mapcar #'f2 ...)))
The compiler, as of now, finds F1 and decides that it needs no closure,
because the variables it accesses are just "lexically" closed and they
can be accessed via a pointer that the function receives. However, after
processing the second flet, the compiler should notice that F1 is
invoked from within a closure (F2), and thus the references to the
variables A, B, C, etc, cannot be done by a mere "pointer", but rather
these variables must form part of a real full-fledge environment.
Your tests, fortunately, is full of funny code like this ;-) Thanks a
lot for your work on it.

* Backquote, comma, comma-at, and comma dot (` , ,@ ,.) are now implemented
using a common macro EXT:UNQUOTE. By default, the reader produces forms
using this macro, which print as they were read
(format nil '`(foo ,@a)) => "`(foo ,@a)"
and it is at evaluation time that they are expanded into calls to LIST,
LIST*, APPEND and NCONC.
* The previous implementation seems to solve a problem with the interaction
between #n# and backquote. For instance, the following form
`(foo #1=(faa ,a) #1#)
now produces the right expansion.
* In pathnames, all strings are converted to simple strings without
fill pointers because otherwise routines like probe-file, chdir, etc
which deal with the C world, become too complicated.

I was about to ask about this :-) This IMHO would significantly boost
the usefulness of ECL.
I am amazed at the quick response, thanks for all the fixes.
--J.
* Fixed configure.in: --with-system-* did not always set the right flags.
* Implemented slot-definition objects. This is an important part of the
MOP which allows one to query the slots of a class and alter their order
in an structured way.
Hmm... Funny how a horrible change with lots of bootstrap problems ends
up described in such a small paragraph :-)
Juanjo
P.S.: I will be away in the following two weeks, with maybe ocasional
access to the internet.
These are the latest fixes committed to CVS:
+ Some bugs in the Mingw32 build fixed (TCP sockets still broken)
+ DEFMACRO accepts again lambda lists of the form (arg1 . arg-rest)
+ ADJUST-ARRAY now works with strings and remembers the element type of
the array.
+ Several fixes in the C code generator for closures.
Regards,
Juanjo
+ Version 6.5 of the Boehm-Weiser garbage collector imported.
+ (FLOAT n/m) works even when "n" and "m" are extremely big integers
which cannot be represented as floating point numbers.
+ COMPILE now always outputs three values, even when building the binary
file succeeded.>
+ COMPILE now honors the value of :OUTPUT-FILE, including the file name
extension. To comply with this, whenever LOAD finds a file name with an
unknown extension, such as "fasl", "bin", etc, it tries first to load it
as a binary file.
+ VECTOR-PUSH-EXTEND and ADJUST-ARRAY now use recursive functions to
traverse multidimensional arrays and do not cons when copying the
content of the original array.
+ Functions ecl_copy/reverse_subarray abstract some destructive
operations on arrays, much like BLAS abstracts handling of vectors in
FORTRAN. The sequence functions and ADJUST-ARRAY are now based on these.
+ The inliner expansions for ROW-MAJOR-AREF and (SETF ROW-MAJOR-AREF)
have been fixed.
Please notify any problem with these changes.

The point is not that. ECL always stores L+1 characters in a string,
where L is the expected size and the last character is enforced to be zero.
The problem is that there are strings in lisp which seem to have less
characters because they have fill pointers. Take, for instance this example
> (progn
(setf *a* (make-array 4 :element-type 'character :fill-pointer 0
:initial-element #\Space))
(vector-push #\h *a*)
(vector-push #\i *a*)
(vector-push #\! *a*)
*a*)
"hi!"
Well, the output string seems to have three characters but it has 4! So
when you pass it to the C world, it sees "hi! " and not "hi!" because
the terminating zero is after the fourth character, not after the #\! as
some people would expect. This problem is not so artificial: it may
happen when you call FORMAT to produce a string, when you concatenate
sequences, etc. I do not remember many functions which are forced to
output simple-string.
My question is not so much as to whether we should protect users or not.
I just want to come up with a solution which is compatible with UFFI and
with people's expectations. If the solution is to set the zero after the
'!' then ok, I can fix the function that takes pointers out of strings
to produce copies when required.
[...After some thinking...]
I think I have found the right fix. Reading the UFFI manual, C-STRING is
expected to be some type of string that can be passed to the C world. If
one expects to have some "buffer" which can be written to by a C
routine, then one has to create a C-STRING. Ok then the solution is to
enforce that these C-STRING be a lisp simple-string . In other words, a
string which has no fill pointer and has as many characters as the user
expected. Then ECL's rule that all strings have a null character at the
end will be enough.
The fix has been committed to CVS. Please raise your hands if I am
allowed to close the associated bug report in Sourceforge.

Hi,
a major reorganization of the compiler is taking place. Roughly, the old
{K,G,E}CL lisp-to-C translators were designed as three layers, called
T1, T2 and T3, which do
(T1) Process each top-level form and translate it into some internal
representation (C1FORMs).
(T2) Process the C1FORMs, removing unreachable code and finally
producing C/C++ code for each form.
(T3) Similar to T2, but for each of the local/global functions which
were created in each of the toplevel forms.
The major problem is that, as you see, everything is organized around
the notion of toplevel form. For each of these, there is a processing
function which compiles it. However, many of the lisp forms can appear
both as toplevel and non-toplevel: for instance PROGN, SYMBOL-MACROLET,
or even DEFUN. This leads to a horrible duplication of code and with
time it has meant that the improvements for non-toplevel forms have not
been propagated to the toplevel compiler.
Right now I am working on reorganizing/redesigning the compiler so that
there is no notion of toplevel form, but just of lisp form. The idea is
that in a near future you will be able to write code as follows
(with-compiler-environment
;; Process all forms into C1 intermediate representation
(let* ((*compile-toplevel* 'T))
(c1forms (mapcar #'lisp-to-c1form myforms)))
;; Finally output the code.
(with-compiler-output (:c-file "foo.c" :h-file "foo.h")
(mapc #'compile-c1form c1forms))))
Of course few people are going to use this, but the idea is that the
compiler should have a very clear, very simple structure, where the fact
that a form is toplevel is signified only by a global variable.
As of now, the code duplication in the T1 phase has been eliminated, and
this has resulted in several fixes for the EVAL-WHEN forms. Furthermore,
there is no longer need for special processing of DEFUN forms, and
CLINES is implemented now as a very simple macro. There's still quite a
lot to do, such as simplifying everything down to the LISP-TO-C1FORM and
COMPILE-C1FORM interface, introducing new macrology, using the condition
system for signalling errors/warnings, and unifying the environments for
toplevel and nontoplevel forms.
Although I am conducting extensive testings before each minor commit, I
expect some instability in CVS. If this is a concern, please stay with
code before 3th July 2005.
Regards,
Juanjo
Latest changes. Notice that the new code for processing command line options
introduces incompatible changes, but allows for compilation of multiple files.
* Design:
- Simplified the structure of the frame stack, removing redundant fields.
- Reworked the structure of the lexical environment to accelerate access to
variables.
- New hash routine, similar to SBCL's one, faster and leading to fewer
collisions between similar strings.
* Visible changes:
- The code for handling command line options has been redesigned. Now multiple
-compile options are allowed; the -o/-c/-h/-data options have to come before
the associated -compile; we introduce a new -rc option to force loading
initialization files; errors during initialization are intercepted and cause
ECL to abort.
I am working on a closification of the compiler code. Maybe after that I will
find some time to review the callbacks code.

Juanjo
Hi,
I have commited several fixes to the reader, plus a fix to the type
subsystem which makes all complex types equivalent to (COMPLEX REAL).
With this, other minor fixes, and a correction to the ANSI test suite,
the number of failures drops down to 43/21344 (0.2%), which is not bad,
I think.
In any case, I will be traveling next week so that means I will not be
able to read emails, solve bugs, etc.

_12<<.What is Run Cadence?
Run cadence is the number of steps per minute an athlete takes while running. Cadence is typically measured by the number of times ONE foot hits the ground over a minute. Similar to cycling cadence, as you run, you should strive for a cadence of about 90. You may have noticed many elite marathoners appear to float along as they run, barely touching the ground, and at a cadence in the high 90s this is no surprise.. Anyone can have a high cadence when sprinting or running fast, but most cannot sustain that pace. The trick here, is learning to increase your cadence (or turnover) when running slow or at a comfortable pace so that your heart rate does not spike. This takes practice and patience, but if you are diligent it WILL PAY OFF. Not only will your body thank you, but if you can increase your cadence by five while holding your heart rate steady, you'll be able to knock off 2 minutes (or more) over 10K.
You can easily check your cadence by counting the number of foot falls over 15 seconds and multiplying that number by four. Manually counting is a great place to start, but I often find this to be a misleading way to check your cadence. When athletes count their steps manually, more often than not they'll hit the target of 90 even if they'd normally never come close. As a result, I do believe this is a good method of training yourself to run at the proper rate, but in terms of checking and monitoring cadence I prefer using Garmin's foot pod, which counts for me. This way there's no cheating.
Another great tool to use while learning to run at a 90 cadence is a metronome. You can set the device to beep at 180 beats per minute. Each beep will represent a foot fall. I recommend running with it on first a few times and then alternate turning if ON and OFF throughout your run to "check in" to see if you're holding a 90 cadence. Remember, it is important to practice this while running at a slow comfortable rate. You must avoid increasing your pace in order to hit the proper cadence. The more you practice, the easier it will become.

Initially available in LG’s home market of Korea only, the range include a fridge with a camera, a washing machine that responds to chat messages, and a microwave/oven with NFC and WiFi baked in.
Quirky? Yes. Useful? Maybe. The fridge camera can send photos of its contents back to you so you know what items you need to buy when you’re out shopping. The washing machine can be remotely activated Line, the popular messaging app with over 400 million registered users. LG says that HomeChat “makes communicating with LG’s smart refrigerator, washing machine or oven much like chatting with a close friend” — it’s certainly unique.
The chat service includes a Quick Button that pulls up commonly-used features for each appliance, and there are three different modes to help you use your appliances while you are on vacation, away or returning home. Line wouldn’t be Line without stickers — HomeChat doesn’t disappoint on that front, offering 40 stickers to add “an enjoyable and personal component” to interactions with your home appliances.
LG says that it is planning to introduce these chatty appliances in other countries, including the US, but there’s no timeframe for when that might happen.Nice to meet you here at Audiko, where you may search for free ringtones for your Android smartphone.

Top ringtones by StudioSmashburger as a company is ubersmart about social media. I have been hearing about them for years solely through blogs, Twitter and Facebook. I honestly don’t know a single person in real life who I have known to talk about them. Yet for several years I have been dying to try a Smashburger.
So imagine my excitement when I rounded the corner to the main road near my house and saw a Smashburger was about to open. I literally squealed to my husband. THEN, my friend Melody let our local group of bloggers know that we were invited to a media event there the day before it opened. Needless to say, I was the first person to RSVP.
And oh. my. word. I was not disappointed. First of all if you get asked to go to a media restaurant event, I am just going to say go. I don’t care what it is for go. Because they will give you a chance to try so many things on the menu (of course you should wear your stretchy pants).
The burgers completely live up to their reputation. I got a simple burger with ketchup, mustard, mayo and pickles and it was still one of my favorite burgers. The fried pickles were so delicious. The shakes are made with Haagen Dazs ice cream so I don’t even need to say more about those.
So lets just talk about the fries. The fries deserve their own paragraph. I tried both the sweet potato and regular fries. They are called Smashfries and I figure if the company is going to put their name on them they better be spectacular. And they were. Oh my word they were. They are seasoned with rosemary, olive oil and garlic. And I don’t know what the magical simple combo does to French fries but me likey.
But what honestly impressed me most is that while part of the restaurant was filled with “media” the other half was filled with friends and families of the employees. I loved that the company valued its employees like that.
I am a little nervous that the new restaurant is so close to home. But I am also a lot grateful they don’t have a drive thru. However I feel as though I need to take my family back there. It would be wrong to not share all that goodness with others.
Have you ever had Smashburger?

But wait, there’s more: Now there are web videos that provide excellent rundowns for voters trying to decide what to do about candidates and ballot issues.
We’re taken with a new project the Washington Secretary of State and TVW (Washington’s C-SPAN) has started, with the useful example of an I-1033 point-counterpoint.
This one, running about 10 minutes, pits initiative backer Tim Eyman against Washington state AARP Director Doug Shadel; after a brief description of the measure – which seeks to cap government spending in the state – each has about four minutes to pitch the case for or against. Both of them get down to the heart of the matter, and you can imagine either of them delivering a somewhat similar argument if you bumped into them on the street.
But this is better: Both Eyman and Shadel know that their opposition will be seen right there, right next to them, so that anything they say that can be challenged, will be challenged. They have enough time to get into the details, to make a comprehensive argument rather than reel off a few soundbites – in fact, because of the time allowed, they effectively have to make comprehensive arguments. Both do a professional job. (As a matter of review, Eyman may come across better to a larger audience; he has a real everyman appeal on video.)
These kind of videos, which could be attached to state campaign guides like those Washington and Oregon issue, could be excellent helps for voters. They’re all a candidate or an issue advocate need to make a personal appeal. And they may begin to make clear the limitations and flaws inherent in all those 30-second commercials we’re accustomed to seeing.Share on FacebookVideo shows developer's BlackBerry 10 style QWERTY for the Apple iPhone
Octopus Keyboard has its own completion engine and learns new words as you use them. There are some issue with the beta version with auto-punctuation and auto-capitalization and a full release is penciled in for May 20th. There is one little problem and that is that iOS, unlike Android, doesn't allow users to change the default QWERTY. That means if you want all eight tentacles of the Octopus Keyboard, you will have to Jailbreak your iOS device to grab up the app from the unofficial Cydia app store.

But again because android allows multiple keyboards you can have keyboards like SwiftKey and it's no space feature or swipe and its fast shipping input or a split keyboard for tablets.

I still prefer dictionary modeRutgers Quick Predictions0 Comments Published on 10.12.2012 by Brian Harrison
The only thing photoshopped is the football.
Syracuse won their Big East opener at home against Pittsburgh last Friday. Now they head on the road to Rutgers as they take on a ranked Scarlet Knights team that is undefeated. What will happen?
Rutgers is a team that gets it done on the ground. The Big East's leading rusher is Jawan Jamison, with over 600 rushing yards. But that's not to say that RU's QB Gary Nova has been a slouch either. He had a great day against UConn. Then again, who couldn't against UConn at this point. Anyway, Syracuse is ripe with confidence after taking down Pittsburgh a week ago and after not scoring a point after the first quarter. The Syracuse defense managed to hold another stud rusher in the league to close to 60 yards. If Jamison can spring loose of the Syracuse run stop on a consistent basis, Syracuse will lose, and probably lose badly. Honestly, I see Rutgers having the kind of game Pittsburgh had against Syracuse. Nova will make 3rd down conversion, but Jamison will be hung up. The question is if Syracuse can again score more points. Throwing picks in the end zone will not help. Playing a turnover free game is the only thing Syracuse can do. And keeping the chains moving through smarter play selections and quarterback protection. Both secondaries can be broken down by these quarterbacks. The team that wins will be the team that's secondary makes the timely play or stop. I think the odds are it will be Rutgers' secondary that has that kind of day, despite what will probably be a valiant effort on the part of Syracuse. Being on the road I just think the chance for calamity on the part of Syracuse is raised. Therefore, pending a perfect offensive effort I think Syracuse falls short in this one. I'm picking Rutgers over Syracuse 24 to 17.
Syracuse is playing the Big East game of the week. That means we're on regional coverage on TWCS, SNY, and ESPN 3 in the nooner. I'll be out of the home office so that means it's a grab bag as to what John and I will be doing during this thing. But either way, it's Rutgers fans that lose.

Links to this postEarlier this month we learned that Ashlee Simpson was planning to make her Broadway debut in the NYC production of Chicago (the same show she performed in on the West End in London, England last year) after she was unceremoniously fired from her gig on Melrose Place … and last night was her premiere night! Here are a few photos of Ashlee on stage in the role of Roxie Hart last night:.”
Welp, if you can’t make it on TV it makes sense that you heed the call if Broadway comes calling. Ash is very lucky that she already played the part in London because, I’m sure, it make her transition to Broadway all that much easier. Even still, I’m sure all the supportive folks in the audience helped her out immensely. After the jump, check out a photo of hubby Pete Wentz and big sis Jessica Simpson chatting with one another during the show’s intermission last night and see a couple pics of Ashl33n on their way to the afterparty …
I have yet to find a review of Ashlee‘s performance last night but I understand she did a great job in London and I have every reason to assume that she did a great job last night as well. Here’s hoping Ashlee has a nice, long run on Broadway with this gig … it’d be a shame if she got axed after 12 performances like she did on Melrose Place, wouldn’t it?

good for ashlee, im happy to see her doing good.
YAY for her black hair! I hope she does well… Good luck Ashlee!
She actually looks the part! I am sure she did a great job!
Congrats to her! I wonder when Jessica’s big break will come…even for her personal life.
-meream
Is it me or does Pete look like Jeremy Piven from the side in the first pic??
i saw her in london on my 18th birthday she was brill
wish i could see her in America!!
She looks great! I bet she did really well.
She’s too thin to make the outfit look sexy.
I don’t get why everyone makes it sound as if it’s a bad thing – like Asslee didnt succeed on TV so she has to do broadway – hell she is doing broadway! That’s harder than TV!
Did she lib sync it?
I love Ashlee! I hope she gets good reviews…I’d like to see it for myself, though.Nasty Note-Writing War Breaks Out on Flight 'Bachelor' producer Elan Gale sends angry woman the 1st note By Neal Colgrass, Newser Staff Posted Nov 30, 2013 3:14 PM CST STORY COMMENTS (20) (Newser) – Ah, the spirit of the season: The producer of ABC's Bachelor and Bachelorette apparently engaged in a bitter note-passing war with a woman who complained about their flight being delayed, Business Insider reports via BuzzFeed. "Today is Thanksgiving!" she cried, according to producer Elan Gale's Twitter feed. "I'm supposed to be with my family. NOT with you people I barely know!" Miffed, Gale sent her a glass of wine (and later two vodkas) with a note saying, "Hopefully if you drink it, you won't be able to use your mouth to talk! Love, Elan." Well, the notes got worse from there. A few excerpts, courtesy of photos on Gale's feed: Diane to Elan: "The wine wasn't funny. The vodka wasn't funny; you're an awful person with no compassion. I'm sorry for your family that they should have to deal with you." Elan to Diane: "Thank you for your lovely note. The person who lacks compassion is you. ... Next time you're in a bad mood, stay home." (This note suggests that she eat something we'd rather not mention.) Diane to Elan: "This is inappropriate beyond belief. I will be speaking to the authorities when we land." Gale claims that after they landed he tried to give her yet another note, and she slapped his face. Gale declined to have her arrested but later said he was "overjoyed" to hear she'd missed her connecting flight, the Daily News reports. Gale later posted a blog admitting that he can seem abrasive or harsh, "but what I've never done is be unkind to a person in a service position. My first job was in a video store." Elan Gale.

3) אל (El), the shorter version of Elohim, meaning God:

The name Michael is commonly translated with Who Is Like God?, but, more accurately, the name denotes an inquiry after

Across North America, 2005 was a watershed year for the supply community, punctuated with significantly more pain than gain. The top two U.S. suppliers – Delphi Corp. and Visteon Corp. – teetered on the brink of insolvency, and dozens of others big and small went broke, continued bleeding money, struggled with too much capacity or landed in bankruptcy court.
Related document: Selected Supplier Earnings
The biggest to seek Chapter 11 shelter from creditors was Troy, MI-based Delphi, which ended the year with delisted stock and the threat of a United Auto Workers strike in protest of drastic pay cuts the supplier was demanding.
In the spring, Visteon unloaded its weakest plants – 23 facilities in all – on former parent Ford Motor Co., which has set out to sell or fix the operations under a new temporary entity, Automotive Components Holdings LLC. Massive restructuring was in store for both Delphi and Visteon.
Transplant Suppliers Thrived
The darker the days grew for suppliers reliant on Big Three volumes, the brighter the prospects became for a handful of transplant suppliers more closely aligned with Japanese and Korean auto makers ramping up production in the U.S.
Denso Corp., partially owned by Toyota Motor Corp. and its No.1 supplier, celebrated in November the grand opening of its new plant in Osceola, AR, to manufacture vehicle heating, ventilation and air conditioning (HVAC) modules and radiators for Toyota and Honda Motor Co. Ltd. vehicles.
Osceola, a Mississippi Delta town decimated by massive losses of manufacturing jobs for two decades, was more than eager to welcome Denso. The starting wage at the plant, which employs nearly 400 people, is just under $10 an hour.
Throughout Japan, component manufacturers enjoyed record sales and profits in 2005 and were upbeat about the future.
Even Bridgestone Corp. posted earnings in excess of $1.5 billion in 2005, despite having paid Ford $240 million in October to settle the Explorer tire recall dispute.
Other Japanese standouts, particularly Toyota-affiliated suppliers, included Aisin Seiki Co. Ltd., Toyota Industries Corp. and Koyo Seiko Corp.
Analysts credited the strong performance to the solid fundamentals and sales of their customers, including Nissan Motor Co. Ltd. and Honda Motor Co. Ltd.
"In the current fiscal year, nine of Japan's 12 vehicle manufacturers will report record profits, 11 of 12 are profitable, and even Mitsubishi (Motors Corp.), the only company expected to report a loss, will make money in the fourth quarter," said Koji Endo, auto analyst at Credit Suisse First Boston (Japan).
In some cases, foreign suppliers bought their way into the Japanese market with varying degrees of success by way of acquisitions. Among them: Robert Bosch GmbH (with Zexel Corp.), GKN plc (with Tochigi Fuji Sangyo K.K.), Goodyear Tire & Rubber Co. (with Sumitomo Rubber Industries Ltd.) and Johnson Controls Inc. (with Ikeda Busan Co.).
Severe Turbulence
Despite a bustling industry in Asia – bolstered in no small measure by explosive growth in China – the scene in the U.S. was quite different.
David Andrea, vice president-business development at the Original Equipment Suppliers Assn. in Troy, MI, said he will remember 2005 as one of the most turbulent years he has ever observed.
"There are really two auto industries, both at the OEM level as well as through the supply chain," Andrea said. Even through the recent travails, Andrea still perceived the auto industry as "a good place to generate good cashflow and return on investment."
But the turbulence became severe for those suppliers heavily tied to General Motors Corp. and Ford as their production schedules unraveled in 2005.
"You look at all the uncertainty around all the significant suppliers – Intermet Corp., Tower, Collins & Aikman, Delphi," Andrea said. "They were looking at both their supply contracts as well as their sourcing contracts and their labor contracts."
For OESA and its 390 supplier members, Andrea said the biggest challenge at the end of 2005 was addressing "how financially fragile the entire supply chain is right now."
About 225 of those 390 members reported sales under $250 million, and most of them were Tier 2 and 3 suppliers selling to the larger Tier 1s.
"These guys are concerned about a customer that potentially could go into Chapter 11, or a sub-tier supplier that they are counting on to go into Chapter 11," Andrea said.
Watching for telltale signs and safeguarding against supply-chain disruptions is part of OESA's mission, as well as helping suppliers manage cashflow.
Survey Charted Profit Skid
Some suppliers did a better job than others in protecting their profitability in an intense marketplace in 2005, according to a survey released in December by IRN Inc., a Grand Rapids, MI, consulting and forecasting firm.
IRN conducted its fifth biennial Supplier Survey in tandem with a companion study in Europe. Some 170 component suppliers in North America, Germany and France participated.
Survey respondents reported experiencing, on average, a 12% decline in their profitability due to increases in raw-material prices. Auto makers and Tier 1 suppliers demanded an average of 6.2% in price reductions from their North American suppliers – down slightly from 6.3% in an IRN survey two years earlier.
Overall, the survey found pressure abated slightly on component suppliers to give price reductions to their auto maker and Tier 1 customers, but the overall environment remained extremely challenging.
Delphi and Visteon’s struggles were merely the tip of the iceberg.
Collins & Aikman filed for bankruptcy May 17 and spent most of the year embroiled in legal disputes. David Stockman, C&A's former chairman and CEO, was forced out by the company's board of directors shortly before the filing. In July, former Federal-Mogul Corp. CEO Frank Macher took over as CEO.
The C&A bankruptcy was the subject of a tirade at the 2005 Frankfurt auto show by Delphi Corp. CEO Robert "Steve" Miller, who used a speech at the show to describe the C&A bankruptcy as “an embarrassment” and to assure that a Delphi bankruptcy would be well financed and not interrupt the delivery of parts worldwide to customers.
Delphi filed for Chapter 11 Oct. 8, but the case immediately was frought with controversy, as the company demanded massive pay cuts of more than 60% from its unions while sweetened severance packages and bonuses were offered top management to keep them on the job.
The United Auto Workers union, which represents 24,000 Delphi employees, banded together with five other unions to form the Mobilizing @ Delphi coalition, which recruited community leaders and Delphi’s investors and others to oppose Miller’s cost-cutting methods.
“This is not just an attack on union people or unions,” UAW President Ron Gettelfinger said. “This is an attack on communities, on our nation, and it shows corporations will go anywhere in a race to the bottom to find the lowest wage. It is a national disgrace that a company should be able to file for bankruptcy here and continue to operate offshore.”
Also late in the year, Dana Corp. announced it would eliminate about 800 jobs at three of its facilities in Canada and Australia as production contracts at the plants expired.
By December 2006, approximately 500 jobs were to be lost at the company's Thorold, Ont., Canada, Structural Products plant (truck frames). By mid-2006, Dana was to axe about 300 positions from its Traction Products facilities in Salisbury, Cheltenham and Yennora, Australia (rear-axle modules).
The Toledo, OH, supplier spent part of 2005 restating financial performance for 2000-2004 and the first half of 2005. The restatements resulted from improper accounting of customer pricing and transactions with suppliers in Dana's commercial-vehicle unit.
Financial restatements served as a precursor for Delphi’s bankruptcy. The same ultimately would be true for Dana, which filed for Chapter 11 protection in early 2006.
If bankrupt suppliers expected sympathy from auto makers, they were sorely disappointed. In a series of interviews with Ward’s, Big Three purchasing executives said they would help bankrupt Tier 1 suppliers as much as possible – and even would step in to pay their debts on occasion.
But they ultimately denied responsibility for their suppliers landing in bankruptcy court because of a prolonged bare-knuckled pricing environment.
"To say we are responsible goes way too far," Peter Rosenfeld, executive vice president-procurement and supply for Chrysler Group, told Ward’s. "I don't force one supplier to take business with DaimlerChrysler – it is the supplier's choice."
Economic pain for U.S. suppliers, because of the nation's free flow of financial information on public companies, is readily more visible here than in other countries, Rosenfeld said.
 said.
Bo Andersson, GM's vice president-worldwide purchasing, said the auto maker typically does not source business to companies in bankruptcy.
“If you're in bankruptcy for two years, you don't get any new business for two years,” Andersson said. “When you are out, it's more or less getting out of jail, right? Why should you hire a guy who has been in jail for two years?"
Tony Brown, Ford's senior vice president-global purchasing, dismissed the notion that auto makers bear responsibility for supplier bankruptcies.
"If they had streaming profits over the moon, would they declare me responsible for that?" Brown asked. "It doesn't connect for me because in the end, it's a 2-sided transaction. There's an offer and an acceptance (to do business). So I struggle with it."
Big 3 Revised Purchasing
Still, the Big Three appeared to be reaching out to suppliers for greater collaboration, as each auto maker in 2005 announced new purchasing strategies designed to focus less on piece price and more on product development and engineering.
“The realization is, that is where the cost saving comes in at the component and system level,” OESA’s Andrea said. “That is progress there.” The new purchasing strategies also recognized suppliers are wrestling with exorbitant price increases for raw materials, and the auto makers said they planned to work more closely with fewer suppliers.
“I think suppliers generally welcomed the chance to improve the working relationships and the methodologies of working on overall cost reductions,” Andrea said.
GM said later in 2005 it was crafting new cost-reduction targets for suppliers, effective in 2006. Likewise, Ford began assembling a pool of “preferred” suppliers it intends to tap for “high-impact” commodities as part of its “Aligned Business Framework.” By the start of 2006, Ford had identified 27 such suppliers.
– with Roger SchrefflerOn July 11, Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) announced a realignment of its company along the lines of function instead of product line. Microsoft hopes that these functional teams can collaborate on developing products that can compete with the likes of the Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL)’s iPad and iPhone, as wells as the Google Inc (NASDAQ:GOOG) Nexus tablet and Android smartphone. Unfortunately, it seems that Microsoft may be waking up too late.
Way behind
Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) resided in an embarrassing sixth place in tablet shipments during Q1 2013, owning a dismal 2% of the market. Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) maintains market leadership with a 39% market share. In an act of desperation Microsoft cut the price of its Surface RT by $150 to spur consumer interest. In fact, Microsoft had to take a $900 million charge in its most recent quarter stemming from inventory adjustments on its Surface RT.
In the most recent quarter, Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) experienced an increase in revenue of 10% due to its new product cycle, versus Apple’s 11% increase. Google Inc (NASDAQ:GOOG) blew past both of them with a 19% increase in revenue. Over the long-term it will most likely be a fight between Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) and Google in terms of tablet and smartphone market leadership, with Microsoft in last place as a fading tech name.
Currently, Microsoft’s chief core competency still resides in operating and productivity software on PCs. With PCs on the endangered species list and the world moving toward a cloud-internet-app consuming marketplace, Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) not only needs new products but a new way of thinking in order to move the needle on its place in the new tech paradigm.
Cultural shift
Based upon the restructuring announcement, you could infer that Microsoft’s product divisions kind of operated on their own without much interaction with other divisions. Each division even sported its own procedures and financing. This created too much bureaucracy.
Steve Ballmer realized that he needed to re-invigorate Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT)’s mojo by encouraging entrepreneurial drive among employees. An entrepreneurial culture seems to work for other big companies such as The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO) and Starbucks Corporation (NASDAQ:SBUX) as they encourage stakeholders to develop product ideas of their own. His statement in the most recent quarter serves as proof of his belief in this new approach,.Popular Applications:

Frederick Ellis Dashiell Jr. | 2/11/2009, 4:30 a.m.
The Boston Red Sox recently opened Fenway Park’s State Street Pavilion to host their seventh annual celebration of the life of Jackie Robinson, the Hall of Famer who in 1947 broke through the so-called “gentlemen’s agreement” that propped up Major League Baseball’s color barrier.
Jan. 31 would have been Robinson’s 90th birthday. He died in 1972.
The Red Sox use the annual event as a teaching opportunity. This year, they hosted about 150 children from citywide after-school programs affiliated with the Boston Centers for Youth and Families as well as students from the Red Sox Scholars Program. At the pavilion, they treated the children to food and drinks — as well as a history lesson.
Dressed in a Brooklyn Dodgers uniform, circa 1947, Gregory Gibson Kenney — a professional actor and member of the National Baseball Hall of Fame Education and Advisory Board — re-enacted scenes from Robinson’s life. He described the trials of Robinson’s youth in California, growing up as part of the only black family in an all-white neighborhood. He also talked about Robinson’s athletic achievements in college, running the gamut from varsity football, track, basketball and baseball.
Kenney then spoke about Robinson’s time in the Negro Leagues, traveling by bus to each game for very little pay. Moving through the crowd, Kenney shook hands with many of the students, then finished his re-enactment by acting out Robinson’s first hit in the big leagues, as well as his first two stolen bases.
The actor said he plays Robinson about 75 times a year as he tours the country with the Hall of Fame Education and Advisory Board.
“It’s incredible to step into Jackie’s shoes for a half-hour,” Kenney said. “I’m overwhelmed by the response of the kids each time.”
After the re-enactment, Kenney was joined on the stage by Tommy Harper, a former Red Sox outfielder who is now a player development consultant for the team; Ted Spencer, vice president and chief curator of the National Baseball Hall of Fame; and current Red Sox pitcher Manny Delcarmen, who played his high school ball at West Roxbury High School.
Harper, 68, was 7 years old when Robinson broke the color barrier.
“The same things that happened to Jackie happened to me,” said Harper. “Like Jackie, I kept moving forward.”
Spencer spoke about moving Robinson’s Hall of Fame plaque for the tribute event. According to Spencer, at Robinson’s request, his original plaque only reflected his on-field achievements. A new plaque, installed in 1997, reflects his status as Major League Baseball’s first black player and also honors his work in the civil rights movement.
Delcarmen gave a current player’s perspective on Robinson’s achievements, as well as his lasting impact on today’s game.
“Jackie Robinson changed a lot of peoples’ thoughts about ethnic players,” said Delcarmen. “We players complain about things that bother us these days, but it doesn’t compare to what Jackie Robinson had to go through.”
At the end of the tribute, the children were given baseballs bearing Robinson’s number 42, which was retired by every MLB team in 1997.
Tairina Diaz, 15, of Roxbury said she was impressed with Robinson’s ability to walk away from the poor treatment he received.
“If it were me, I would have fought back,” said Diaz.
Kervina Alexander, 13, of Roxbury said she was inspired by Robinson’s story.
“If we follow our dreams and work hard, we can be successful like Jackie Robinson,” Alexander said.BOSTON -- Scientists are using genetic studies and natural chemicals, such as plant-derived triterpenoids, to further our knowledge on how genetic and early molecular interactions can lead to cancer, and how those early interactions can be manipulated to stave off a variety of cancers. The latest studies with new and promising chemopreventive agents were presented at the American Association for Cancer Research's Frontiers in Cancer Prevention Research meeting today.
Trterpenoids and the rexinoid LG100268 prevent lung tumors induced by vinyl carbamate in strain A/J mice
New synthetic drugs called triterpenoids which owe their origins to plant molecules have demonstrated their effectiveness in slowing the growth of lung cancer tumors, a research team from Dartmouth University has found.
Following up on previous work showing strong links between inflammation.
"Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer deaths in the United States," said Liby. "Since the mortality from this disease is significant, and prognoses are poor once a patient has been diagnosed, prevention may provide the only avenues to combat this particular cancer. We think this study shows a promising role for triterpenoids and the drug LG100268 in stopping lung tumor growth."
The scientists knew that the compounds had anti-inflammatory properties and that LG100268 in particular could stop certain types of breast cancer in animal models. The compounds inhibited inflammation in a number of ways: halting nitric oxide production, blocking cyclo

The word Deuteronomy means “second law.” Do you remember when the Law was first given? What happened to the original tablets? Why? This book is a historical review of Exodus, Leviticus, and Numbers – with the benefit of hind-sight. Moses is able to receive the Law a second time with the backdrop of the story of the preceding 40 years.
Remember the 12 spies? Ten said no and two said “go.” Imagine how Joshua and Caleb felt as they entered the promised land. Though they were totally ready 40 years earlier, they have remained faithful and ready within the promise!
What do you pick up about Moses’ attitude regarding his journeys? The outcome of being denied access to the Beautiful Land? How can “the humblest man on the earth” be denied the promise of the promised land?
I love these verses:
Veteran actor Kofi Laing popularly known in showbiz circles as ‘Kohwe’ has been reported dead.
According to reports reaching Ghnewsonline Entertainment sources, he died on Thursday at his Accra residence.
Sources say the veteran actor suffered from a stroke recently and was receiving treatment.
The jovial actor during an interview on Adom FM’s Work and Happiness in 2019, called on Ghanaians to support him and other actors.
Kohwe bemoaned the appalling conditions of veterans who worked hard to bring smiles to entertain Ghanaians.
The ace actor disclosed that he did not make money from acting stressing his love for comedy kept him in the industry.
Kohwe also revealed that he had to quit his job at the Foreign Affairs Ministry for acting.
“I don’t regret acting comedy because I would have died long ago like some of my colleagues died out of depression, sorrow and as paupers,” he said.
Following his call for help, a few individuals extended a hand.
Ablekuma West MP Ursula Owusu-Ekuful promised to support him.
She visited Kohwe while on tour in the constituency ahead of the December 2020 elections.
Kohwe featured in the popular Akan Drama as well as the “Kaneshie Odorkor” TV series.
His use of the British English Language and Fante in “District Colonial Court” captivated the hearts of many Ghanaians.

I cannot imagine what you have been through Christina, but I sincerely hope that everything goes exactly as you wish and hope this time for you and for the baby. I know that it is good to be flexible in planning, but I am a great believer in planning as at least then you know what you are hoping for and where you are starting from. Take care. xx
Thank you Amy. Here's to plans coming to fruition. :)
Oh my! You have to request that the door be shut? Seriously?? Oh my again.
One of the midwives at a pregnancy class (when I was pregnant with Joe, my first born) said to me that I had been quiet during the class & I didn't ask any questions at all... was I ok & what was my birth plan. I told her that my birth plan was to get to the hospital (that we had booked into) with my husband! She laughed & said that was the best plan she had heard! I was spoilt though, I went private hospital, with a great Obstetrician the first time & the nurses were fab. They didn't ask me if I wanted a pain killer, instead they asked my hubby if I did (he knew when I went beyond the coping stage). But geesh, I'm still in shock that you need to ask to have the door shut!
Good luck with it all, I hope that all the plans go well. Will you guys be collecting the cord blood for storage?
I can't even remember now if the door was shut with Cohen's birth. I know people just came and went as they pleased. But often the door isn't shut. The lights certainly aren't dimmed. This time around I want to know the door is shut. I want only the necessary people there with me, without disturbances. Just positive support.
Last time I donated the cord blood. This time I will be delaying the cord cutting so bubba gets the blood.
I am so glad that you have Elissa on your side this time! I really, really hope that you get your dream birth.
I think that visualising your best birth is so important…you need to have a birthing goal.
And like you said, if things start to deviate, then it is you and Dave who need to be in control of the decision making. You should be treated with respect and the decisions you make should be informed and involve what is best for you and for your baby!
Best of luck!
I am sure you will be amazing!
Thanks so much Caitlin,
I hope so! There are so many disappointing statistics surrounding birth. We've been doing it for so long, you'd think we would have gotten it right by now?!
What!? The door is open?? Geez. With all my health concerns I probably fall into the "if I ever got to take a healthy baby home I would be happy" category but maybe if I ever get pregnant I will be writing a birth plan just to request the door being closed and no glary lights.
Yes, often the door is open and people come and go as they please. I think the staff become a bit numb to it all, they are so used to it. You've probably noticed that yourself in hospitals? But studies have shown that how you birth your baby affects how you bond with them and how likely you are to suffer post natal depression etc. So I think it really is important and women should be informed and make conscious decisions and not just do what is easiest for the staff!
wishing you a healthy happy baby and birthing process, naturally if possible :)
Nothing went to plan for my first born either. Despite having been well informed, having attended yoga throughout my pregnancy and having all the plans in place etc I had an emergency c section and a sick baby in special care unit. Second and third time round I didn't have a formal birth plan but I followed my heart and against my obs suggestion, I went on to have two wonderful vbacs. Both very different-one induced, one natural labour. I'm so happy I followed my heart but I would have done whatever was medically necessary had there been any complications. So much is in our hands but so much isn't as well. Every babys story is so unique and is simply that..their story. I really just wanted you to know that vbacs can and do happen and I hope you get the birth you are hoping for. It sounds like you are well informed and supported so fingers crossed. Sending much love and good vibes your way.Dan Rather did not make it to his scheduled Bill O Reilly appearance this week, but he did manage to make it to a book signing in Washington, D.C. on Thursday night.
Rather, who is 81-years-old, has covered some of the most intense and profound events of US history such as Martin Luther King, the assassination of JFK and the Watergate scandal.
Rather subsequently sued CBS for $70 million, claiming he was the scapegoat for the scandal. However his suit was dismissed by several courts, which led to the publication of Rather’s tell-all book “Rather Outspoken.”
Rather was in DC Thursday to promote the book, which hit stores Monday.
When Rather was asked why he ran the story even after he had already been labeled a partisan journalist, he simply said, “Because it was true.” He also said, “You are what your record is.” After explaining the timeline of his life since he was a small child he said, “Does this sound like the record of a communist, socialist, liberal?
“I didn’t realize this was the beginning of the end for me,” Rather recollected. Four producers involved were fired, and Rather retired shortly after what many refer to as “Rathergate.” During his book talk Rather blamed CBS for the affair instead of taking personal responsibility for his mistake, saying, “they did not want to own the story,” and that, “CBS News was unprepared for a campaign altercation.”
He went into further blame game mode by claiming Bush “couldn’t attack the basis of the truth of the story.”
“They took the emphasis off of if the story was true and focused on the documents,” he said.
Partisan people will attack news that they don’t agree with, Rather accused.
Rather also attacked the entire television news industry claiming “entertainment values have overthrown news values.”
He said he thinks that if someone were to “suggest to cover Afghanistan or Sudan for the primetime news, you would either be sent to a mental institute or asked what you’re smoking.”
It is clear Rather holds resentment towards his former vocation.
“Large news corporations need things out of Washington and Washington needs things from the news corporations,” he told the audience.
Rather advised reporters covering presidential campaigns to ask, “Who is giving what money to whom in expecting to get what?”Shaken and embattled during its completion phase, and carrying the memory of Natalie Wood's death Brainstorm is a high-tech $18 million movie dependent on the visualization of a fascinating idea.

Can a well-connected New York bank convince lawmakers on Capitol Hill to make a tweak to the Dodd-Frank financial overhaul law?
- Bloomberg
- Howard Milstein in 2008
Emigrant Savings Bank, a privately held bank run by Howard Milstein, a prominent real estate investor and backer of New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo, is trying to do so.
The bank is seeking a four word-change to the 2010 law, arguing that it will soon be unfairly ensnared by regulations intended for bigger institutions.
Without the tweak, the bank says it will be forced to count fewer assets as loss-absorbing capital. With a smaller buffer, bank officials say they will be less able to make loans.
The House Financial Services Committee is scheduled to consider the measure on Thursday. It has the support of a bipartisan group of six House members from New York and no public opposition thus far.
However, lawmakers in the Senate have shown little interest in making even minor tweaks to the sweeping overhaul of regulations for the financial system, so Emigrant could face long odds there..
The bill “will allow Emigrant to continue to fulfill its important mission as a portfolio lender of residential and small business loans in the New York City boroughs,” Mr. Wald told lawmakers. The bill was introduced by Rep. Michael Grimm (R., N.Y.) and Reps Carolyn Maloney, Peter King, Gregory Meeks, Nan Hayworth and Carolyn McCarthy.
So far, there do not appear to be objections to Emigrant’s push – although some lawmakers might not favor legislation that would only impact one institution.
“You took steps basically to enhance your finances, the flexibility and the capital to be able to have a greater financial firewall in light of the uncertainty of the times,” Rep. Maloney, a Democrat. told Mr. Wald. “It seems like an appropriate example here that no good deed goes unpunished.”

Ernest W. SHAHID and Margaret P. Shahid, individualy and
d/b/a Shoreline Hotel and Cottage Clony, Appellants,
v.
GULF POWER COMPAY, Appellee.
No. 18177.
United States Court of Appeals Fifth Circuit.
June 6, 1961, Rehearing Denied July 19, 1961.
Walter B. Fincher and Joe Salem, Atlanta, Ga., for appellants.
E. Dixie Beggs, of Yonge, Beggs & Lane, Pensacola, Fla., for appellee.
Before RIVES, CAMERON and BROWN, Circuit Judges.
RIVES, Circuit Judge.
This appeal is from a summary judgment in favor of Gulf Powr Company, defendant below, and against Ernest W. and Margaret P. Shahid, plaintiffs below. The plaintiffs sought $500,000 damages from the defendant for its alleged negligence in the destruction by fire of the plaintiffs' Shoreline Hotel on April 16, 1956. The questions presented are whether there was any genuine issue as to ay material fact as to the defendant's alleged negligence, and whether the defendant was entitled to judgment as a matter of law. Rule 56(c), Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, 28 U.S.C.A.
The salient facts were these: Plaintiffs' hotel was situated facing Highway 98 and the Gulf of Mexico about fifteen miles east of Fort Walton Beach, Florida, and a little less tha a mile west of a substation maintained by the defendant. At the substation the current which was conducted to plaintiffs' premises from the east was reduced to about 12,000 volts. Plaintiffs' hotel was serviced by wires passing through a transformer situated justed off of plaintiffs' premises where the current was further reduced to 208 and 120 volts.
On the morning of the fire, between three and four o'clock, plaintiffs were awakened by loud shouting of a guest accompanied by continuous blowing of his automobile horn. Upon arising they found that the hotel was in total darkness, and upon looking across the road they saw that lights wre burning in a nearby establishment, from which they knew that the trouble was upon their own premises. Dressing quickly, they went towards the point where the guest was giving the alarm and found sparks, which they took to be electrical sparks, being emitted from a ground floor storage room through a louvered door. In this room wre located the fuse boxes and circuit breakers connected with the hotel's electrical system. The room above, from which some evidences of fire were observed, contained the main switch by which the electrical current into the hotel could be cut off. The electrical equipment on the hotel premises and belonging to plaintiffs led to a goose-necked mast on top of the hotel where defendant's service wires wre connected. Soon after plaintiffs arrived downstairs, bright flashing and arcing were observed at and nearby this mast and along defendant's wires where they were connected with the wiring system of plaintiffs.
As soon as they had been able to size up the situation and before much evidence of actua fire had appeared, plaintiff Ernest Shahid, finding all telephones in the vicinity inoperative, drove to Silver Beach, about seven miles away, and caled defendant's emergency serviceman Ratliff in Fort Walton reporting the situation and asking that he come promptly and disconnect the electrical wiring. After Ernest Shahid had returned, his wife carried their children to Silver Beach and there by telephone reported the fire to several fire compaies in nearby towns.
Ratliff, immediately upon being caled by Shahid, telephoned his co-worker Barfield and the two hastily dressed. Barfield drove defendant's service truck to Ratliff's house and picked him up, and they proceeded to plaintiffs' hotel. When they arrived, the arcing at and around the service mast had ceased and the wires to the hotel had been severed and were lying on the ground.
The issues framed by the pleadings and further evidence developed by depositions and affidavits are stated in the opinion of the district court granting the defendant's motion for summary judgment, which opinion is reported in 23 F.R.D. at page 245.
Before rendering summary judgment the district court must determine both (1) 'that there is no genuine issue as to ay materia fact' and (2) 'that the moving party is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law.' Rule 56(c), Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. Requisite (2) does not automaticaly follow from requisite (1).
In Palmer v. Chamberlin, 5 Cir., 1951, 191 F.2d 532, 540, 27 A.L.R.2d 416, we said:
'* * * before rendering judgment the Court must be satisfied not summary judgent until the facts and circumstances have been sufficiently developed to enable the Court to be reasonably certain that it is making a correct determination of the question of law.'
In Demandre v. Liberty Mutual Insurance Compay, 5 Cir., 1959, 264 F.2d 70, 72, we stated that:
'* * * whether the 'facts' stated in the complaint present a 'genuine issue as to ay material fact' as F.R.Civ.P. 56 requires is really to be measured by whether no evidence could be offered to support the plaintiff's theory.'
In Alabama Great So. R. Co. v. Louisville & Nashville R. Co., 5 Cir., 1955, 224 F.2d 1, 5, 50 A.L.R.2d 1302, we recognized 'that as a general proposition the issue of negligence, incuding the related issue of wanton conduct, is ordinarily not susceptible of summary adjudication.'
In Dyer v. MacDougall, 2 Cir., 1952, 201 F.2d 265, 269, Judge Learned Hand pointed out the necessity in some cases of an examination of a witness in open court, 'that the immediate presence of a judge in a court-room was likely to make him tell more.'
In Subin v. Goldsmith, 2 Cir., 1955, 224 F.2d 753, 758, referred to approvingly by this Circuit in Alabama Great So. R. Co. v. Louisville & Nashville R. Co., supra, Judge Frak stated that:
'Particularly where, as here, the facts are peculiarly in the knowledge of defendants or their witnesses, should the plaintiff have the opportunity to impeach them at a trial; and their demeanor may be the most effective impeachmet.'
As to whether the first requisite for summary judgment-- 'that there is no genuine issue as to any materia fact'-- has been met,
'* * * the court should take that view of the evidence most favorable to the party against whom it is directed, giving to that party the benefit of all favorable inferences that may reasonably be drawn from the evidence. If, when so viewed, reasonable men might reach different conclusions, the motion should be denied and the case tried on its merits.'
Ramsouer v. Midland Valley R. Co., 8 Cir., 1943, 135 F.2d 101, 106; see also, 6 Moore's Federal Practice, 2nd ed., p. 2114.
The evidence showed that the defendant furnished the electric power to plaintiffs' hotel. The district court found that:
'Admittedly, the fire was of electrical origin. The depositions of plaintiffs establish that the fire started on the ground floor of the hotel building in a room housing the electrical equipment of the plaintiffs. Plaintiffs state that they saw arcing and sparking in this room, and later on the service lines running from the defendant's transmitter pole to the service mast on top of the hotel, and that, therefore, there must be an inference at least that the fire might have started from some negligence on the part of the defendant.'
Shahid v. Gulf Power Company, N.D.Fla.1959, 23 F.R.D. 245, 246.
Mrs. Shahid testified that after all evidences of power over the main switch of the hotel were gone, 'it was evident that we were still being fed current and yet there were no lights on. Q. What was the evidence that you were still being fed current? A. Seeing the electrical arc through from their transformer into our building.' R. L. Pulley, defendant's vice president and operating manager, testified by affidavit:
'* * * that any short-circuit or failure between the customers main fuses and the transformers would be protected against by the fuses of the power company on the pole with the transformers; that these fuses upon disintegrating ordinarily cause the hinged holder or 'jack' to drop down, giving a visual indication from the ground that the circuit is open, but the dropping of the holder or 'jack' is not essential to the opening of the circuit, the protection being afforded solely by the distintegration of the fuse; that it would be possible for the holder or 'jack' to fail to drop after the 'blowing' of the fuse due to corrosion or other cause but this rarely, if ever, occurs.'
Ernest Shahid testified in part:
'Q. In the first count of your complaint you state that there was a dangerous overload of electricity where the defendant's lines entered your premises. On what do you base that allegation? A. On the basis of the arcing and sparking I saw before I left to call Gulf Power Company up.
'Q. Do you base it on anything else? A. On the shooting coming through that storage room next to room No. 5.
'Q. Do you base it on anything else? A. Not unless it would be on the trouble I had been having with my light bill and the lights dying down and coming up instantly.'
Mr. Dawkins, defendant's District Engineer, testified that, 'ordinarily arcing on the secondary lines will blow the transformer fuses.'
The defendant's lineman, emergency serviceman, Ratliff testified:
'Q. Is there anything at the pole at the Shoreline Hotel which would cut off the current to the hotel in the event of trouble? A. They have jacks there.
'Q. How do those operate? A. They have a fuse in them and when the fuse blows they drop out.
'Q. What would cause a fuse to blow out? A. Shortage on the low side of the fuse would cause them to blow.
'Q. In other words, if there was a short on the Shoreline Hotel side of the transformers it would blow the fuses? A. That's right.
'Q. What would it take in the way of a short to blow a fuse? Can you tell us what sort of condition would have to exist before the fuses would blow? A. No. I could not. There would be lots of different things that would blow a fuse. Just a shortage inside the switch or anywhere in his place would blow our fuse.
'Q. Would you say that would afford some protection to the Shoreline Hotel, then? A. Yes, on a shortage it would.
'Q. You say on a shortage it would. Is there any other thing that would blow a fuse in the jacks? A. Did you mean other things besides a shortage?
'Q. Yes, what I mean, are there other things besides a shortage which would cause the jacks to blow? A. Yes, overload or a lot of things can cause the fuse to blow.
'Q. Assume that there happened to be an overload on the line on this night, at what stage would the jacks function in order to cut off the current, on the overload? A. The same as the other.
'Q. Would the fuses blow in time to save the hotel from a dangerous overload of current? A. They are supposed to.
'Q. If there were arcing between the pole, which I understand is located right outside the Shoreline Hotel, if there were arcing from the pole to the hotel, would you say there was a condition of overload or shortage involved? A. Well--
'Q. What would cause the arcing? A. I could not tell you what would cause the arcing between the hotel and the pole. It would blow the fuse also.
'Q. It should blow the fuse? A. Yes, it would blow the fuse that went to it.'
The defendant's other lineman and emergency serviceman, Barfield, testified:
'Q. Are there any means whereby the current would cut off automatically in the event of trouble? A. On the transformer pole.
'Q. The jacks they referred to? A. Yes.
'Q. What sort of trouble would it take for the jacks to operate? A. An overload.
'Q. Assuming there was a dangerous overload coming into the Shoreline Hotel, would those jacks, if they were functioning properly, cut off the current? A. Yes, sir.
'Q. Did you make you statement to any one at the scene concerning shooting the transformers with a shotgun or any other kind of gun? A. No, sir.
'Q. You made no such statement? A. No, sir.
'Q. Did you make a statement to any one else concerning the use of a shotgun or some other type of gun? A. No, sir.'
Mr. Shahid had testified:
'A. * * * Mr. Barfield made this statement to this Brent Neilson, 'Two well-placed bullets could have ended all of that.'
'Q. Could have ended all of that?
'A. It could have severed their current from out building.
'Q. How did he happen to make that statement?
'A. Mr. Neilson is noted for his fancy guns, and he saw him there, and he asked him where one of his fancy guns was, and he said 'Why' and he tole him.'
District Engineer Dawkins testified:
'Q. A statement has been attributed to one Gulf Power Company employee, Barfield, to the effect that he could have shot out the transformers. Is that possible?
'A. Shot out, what do you mean?
'Q. Shot them out.
'A. It is possible.'
Ernest Shahid testified that:
'* * * Mr. Ratliff told me the night of the fire when he came out there after Mr. Barfield left me, he came over when I was on this end, and I was talking to Mr. Ratliff, and he told me he could not understand why those jacks didn't kick off, and he said something about using some kind of long thing to get those wires on, but he said he could not understand why those jacks didn't go off. Mr. Ratliff made that statement to me.'
Ernest Shahid further testified:
'A. * * * At a later time I asked Mr. Barfield I wondered why those jacks didn't work on the hotel, and he said, 'I truthfully don't know why those jacks didn't work, but if your jacks and worked your hotel would never have burned down.'
'Q. Mr. Barfield said that?
'A. Mr. Barfield made that statement to me the morning of the fire.
'Q. When he serviced the pump?
'A. Yes.'
Appellee argues that the purported declarations by Ratliff and Barfield are not competent evidence. We quote from appellee's brief:
'Even if these purported declarations might otherwise present an issue, they are not admissible in evidence.
"Competency of the agent to make admissions on the subject is not alone sufficient; the admission which it is sought to use must have been made in connection with the discharge of the agent's duty, and must be a statement of fact, rather than an expression of opinion.' 31 C.J.S. (Evidence 343, p.) 1115
'The sole duty of these two employees was to render emergency repairs. They were not authorized to make statements or express opinions binding on the defendant. The statements do not relate to any repair work done by them but to a supposed condition existing before their arrival and with which they had nothing to do, and which required no work or repairs on their part.'
If the question be considered as involving merely a procedural rule as to the admissibility of evidence, then, under Rule 43(a), Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, the rule, whether federal or state, which favors reception of the evidence governs. New York Life Ins. Co. v. Schlatter, 5 Cir., 1953,203 F.2d 184, 188; Hambrice v. F. W. Woolworth Co., 5 Cir., 1961, 290 F.2d 557. If, on the other hand, the question turns upon substantive law as to the scope of the agent's or employee's authority (see IV Wigmore on Evidence, 3rd ed., Sec. 1078, p. 119), then the state law would control.
In a recent case involving injuries sustained as a result of falling on stairs immediately inside the door at the service department entrance of a Montgomery Ward & Company store, the District Court of Appeals of Florida, Second District, held that a statement of the assistant manager concerning a sign on the door at the time of the accident was admissible, and discussed the Florida law as follows:
'The courts of this country are somewhat in conflict on the question of whether an agent's statements, which are vicarious admissions against the interests of his principal, are admissible in evidence in an action against the principal by a third party. If such an admission were made by the principal himself, it would be clearly admissible as an exception to the hearsay rule. This question, therefore, turns upon the rules of agency and whether the agent was acting within the scope of his authority.
'We think that in their many conflicting opinions the various courts of this country have developed three different rules. One of these rules allows the evidence if the agent was authorized by the principal to make statements for him concerning the subject matter of the statement. A second rule will allow the agent's admission if the statement cncerned a matter within the scope of his agency and was made before the termination of the agency. A third rule adds to the former two rules the requirement that the statement be a part of the res gestae. It is very obvious that the first rule is far more strict than the second because it requires the agent to have express statement-making authority. The second rule does not require such authority to have been expressly granted but implies it from the agent's authority or employment with the subject matter of the statement. It is this second rule, in view of the Florida holdings, with which we are concerned.
'In Myrick. v. Lloyd, 158 Fla. 47, 27 So.2d 615, 616, we think the Supreme Court of Florida has answered one phase of the defendant's question. In that case a father was being driven on a business trip by his son, who was also his employee, when the son ran over a boy. After the accident the father directed the son to take the boy's parents to the hospital. While en route to the hospital the son tole the parents of the injured boy that the accident was his own fault and not the fault of their boy. The Supreme Court held that the son was the agent of the father and the statements of admission made to the parents was admissible against the father. The court said, in part, as follows:
"* * * The best authority, to our mind, is found in Wigmore on Evidence, Vol. IV, Sec. 1078, page 119: 'He who sets another person to do an act in his stated as agent is chargeable in substantive law by such acts as are done under that authority; so too, properly enough, admissions made by the agent in the course of exercising that authority have the same testimonial value to discredit the party's present claim as if stated by the party himself.'
"We recognize a conflict of authority on this question; however we have chosen the above as the more practical and liberal rule. The purpose here was not to prove agency. That fact had already been established. When this statement was made the status of principal and agent continued. It is a fact that the agent was acting pursuant to express authority and direction of the principal when the statement was made. It is also a fact that the statement had reference to matters occurring within the scope of his employment. When so acting the agent was acting for the principal who might have made such an admission himself against his own interest. If is our conclusion that in this case the statement was admissible * * *.'
'The court held in accordance with the second rule stated above, and its opinion is ample authority for admission of the statement with which we are concerned, notwithstanding the fact that the statement in the instant case was made nine days after the accident.' Montgomery Ward & Co. v. Rosenquist, 2 Cir., Fla.App. 1959, 112 So.2d 885, 886, 887.
Applying the italicized 'second rule,' supra, held applicable in Florida, it is not disputed that if the statements were made at all, they were made before the termination of the agency of either Ratliff or Barfield. Ernest Shahid testified that Ratliff's statement was made the night of the fire, and Barfield's the morning of the fire when he serviced the pump. A prima facie case for admissibility has, we think been made. The scope of the agency of Ratliff and of Barfield may be more fully developed upon the trial. Summary judgment should be refused until the facts have been sufficiently developed to enable the court to be reasonably certain that it is making a correct determination of the question of the scope of agency of Ratliff and of Barfield. See Palmer v. Chamberlin, 5 Cir., 1951, 191 F.2d 532, 27 A.L.R.2d 416.
The defendant rests heavily on the extensive affidavit of its vice president and operating manager, R. L. Pulley, an expert electrical engineer, and emphasizes the fact that the plaintiffs produced no opinion from an expert and announced that they did not 'intend to use an electrical engineer or expert at the trial (other than Wallace Dawkins, an employee of the defendant, to be called as an adverse witness. His deposition taken by plaintiffs is also submitted for consideration in connection with this motion.)' Expert Pulley's affidavit concluded:
'That based on his years of experience and knowledge in the field and the testimony given in said depositions the affiant finds no evidence whatever indicating a failure on the part of the defendant to provide protection to the plaintiffs nor is there any evidence indicative of the transmitting of current in a quantity or a manner that would have contributed to the destruction of the plaintiffs' hotel.'
We think that there is applicable here the principle announced by the Supreme Court in Sentilles v. Inter-Caribbean Shipping Corporation, 1959,361 U.S. 107, 109, 110, 80 S.Ct. 173, 4 L.Ed.2d 142, to the effect that the members of the jury, rather than the expert witnesses, are the ones sworn to make a legal determination of the question of causation. The plaintiffs are, of course, not bound by their expressed intention not to use an electrical engineer or expert at the trial.
We conclude as we did in Chapman v. Hawthorne Flying Service, 5 Cir., 1961, 287 F.2d 539, 541:
'Without intimating any conclusions on the merits, and * * * snot inconsistent with this opinion.'
Reversed and remanded.
CAMERON, Circuit Judge (dissenting).
I am unable to agree with my Brethren who have decided that the summary judgment entered by the court below should be reversed and this case sent back for a hearing on the mertis. I think that a directed verdict will inevitably ensue and that, under the circumstances appearing in this reocrd, the long and tedious hearing upon such a procedure ought to be avoided.
The case is a close one, But I think that is as important to see that the salutary summary judgment procedures are utilized in proper cases as it is to protect litigants from their employment in cases where the record shows that the party appealing is entitled to such a hearing.
It should be understood that the testimony of every single person who knew anything about the fire was takne by deposition and full right of cross examination offered, except for the affidavit of appellee's vice president, Pulley, which was not controverted or challenged by the appellants even though they had employed experts with the view of using them if their statements had been favorable. The court below, therefore, had before it everything which would be developed in a trial upon the merits, and it found taht no negligence had been shown by appellants. This being true, I think we should affirm the conclusions reached by it.
It is helpful to consider at this point exactly what the lower court did say about the failure of the appellants to sustain the burden resting upon them in the presentatin to it.1 It will be found helpful, too, to set forth the summary of the argument advanced before us in the brief of appellants.2
It is well to recall also that the case was heard by the court below on the second motion for summary judgment in which the appellee relied upon the pleadings, the depositions of the appellants, the affidavit of R. L. Pulley, appellee's vice president, and a list of witnesses furnished by the appellants pursuant to pretrial order, including the statement taht they did not intend to produce as a witness any electrical engineer or other expert; and upon the written opposition of appellants to this motion in which it was stated that appellants would rely upon the pleadings, the depositions of the two appellants, and the depositions of four of appellee's employees, including the two serviciemen Ratliff and Barfield who were called to the fire.
It is undisputed in the record that the servicemen arrived well in advance of the fire fighting equipment, that the west end of the hotel was generally in flames, that the arcing at and around the servince mast had ceased, and that the wires to the hotel had been severed and were lying on the ground. The testimony of appellants that the servicemen came onto the scene slowly and stood around doing nothing is lacking in probative value for the reason that the severance of the wires they had been called upon to effect had already been accomplished.
Soon after the two servicement had arrived the desire was expressed that the hotel water pump be reconnected so that the water from it culd be used on the raging fire. One of the servicemen mounted the pole upon which the transformer was situated and, finding that all of the fuses had disintegrated, re-fused one of the lines and connected it up with the pump, which immediately began discharging water in a normal way.
I deal, first, with appellants' contention that the servicemen did not proceed with reasonable speed in cutting off the electrical current after being advised of the emergency. I think that the court below was correct in holding that there was no issue of fact on this point. I pass over the settld principle taht estimates, especially under circumstances of stress such as were present here, are not highly probative, Illinois Central Railroad Co. v. Underwood, 5 Cir., 1956, 235 F.2d 868, 873, and cases cited. Disregarding the estimate of time given by the two sercicemen and accepting that of appellants, and relating it to the other testimony given by the two appellants, I do not think that there was any substantial evidence that the servicemen were guilty of any unreasonable delay which contributed in any way to the starting of the fire or its spread.
By appellants' own proof, the current serving the lighting system of the hotel, both inside and out, had been cut off by the operation of safety devices before appellants were awakened. Assuming that the testimony of appellants that they discovered arcing and flashing at and near the entrance mast after they had gone into the yard of the hotel tended to prove that current was still being delivered to that point, appellant Shahid testified that, after he had driven to Silver Beach and 'phoned serviceman Ratliff and had immediately returned at high speed to the hotel, the arcing at the entrance mast had ceased. There was no evidence, therefore, that the current had not then been cut off entirely, which was considerably before the servicemen could have arrived; since the appellant Shahid did not have to stop to dress after he telephoned Ratliff, and his return journey was less than half that which the servicemen had to take. This, coupled with the undisputed proof that the wires had separated and fallen to the ground by the time the servicemen arrived, and that when, shortly thereafter, one of them mounted the pole to the transformer, he found taht all of the fuses had disintegrated, eliminated the time it took the servicemen to arrive at the scene of the fire after notice, as a significant element in the proof.
Much is made by appellants over statements the appellants claimed to have elicited from Ratliff and Barfield sometime after their arrival to the effect that 'had the 'jacks' worked on the night of the fire, the hotel would not have burned.' This statement, attributed to Ratliff and Barfield by one or both of the plaintiffs, was described in appellants' brief as 'by far the most damaging evidence against appellee.'
In describing these jacks, Pulley, who had been chief engineer for appellee for more than thirty years, used these words in his affidavit: '* * * these fuses upon disintegrating ordinarily caused the hinged holder or 'jack' to drop down, giving a visual indication from the ground that the circuit is open, but the dropping of the holder or 'jack' is not essential to the opening of the circuit, the protection being afforded solely by the disintegration of the fuse * * *'
These statements attributed to the servicemen were not, therefore, of any probative value in the court's consideration of the case because, by introducing the depositions of Ratliff andBarfield unconditionally, the appellants made them their witnesses;3 and, moreover, the servicemen were not asked about these alleged sttements when appellants' attorney was examining them, so that the predicate was not laid to impeach these witnesses. This is so even if, contrary to the Federal Rule, appellants would have had the right to impeach their own witnesses. 4 Moore's Federal Practice, 2d Ed., pp. 1204-1205, and 5 ib., pp. 1348-1349. Finally, opinions given by the servicemen outside the scope of their agency (which involved only emergency work on the appellee's equipment) would not, if entitled to any consideratoin at all, have any effect towards establishing as fact the truth of the matter dealt with in the opinions. Cf. 31 C.J.S. Evidence 343, pp. 1113, et seq.
Appellee filed the affidavit of its operating manager, a graduate electrical engineer dyly registered in the State of Florida. Substantially five months elapsed between the filing of this affidavit and the hearing of the motion for summary judgment, and appellants failed to avail themselves of the right to cross examine this witness, and failed to offer any evidence contravening what Pulley stated. They admitted that they had consulted and reports from one or more experts, but they did not offer their testimony. Pulley was acquainted with appellee's equipment at and near the hotel and the installations on its premises. He swore that the transformers, fuses, lightning arrestors and other items of equipment serving appellants' property were all standard equipment which was designed to protect, and did actually protect, appellants from overloading, short circuits and like occurrences which might endanger the electrical system maintained by appellants and their property upon which it was situated. Having heard the testimony of all of the witnesses whose depositions were offered by the parties and being acquainted with the room from which the sparks were said to have emanated, as well as all of the equipment in and around the premises, electrical and otherwise, he gave as his expert opinion that the sparks in the storage room were produced by the gas hot water heater and gas lines within that room; that the arcing and flashing at and near the service mast were the aftermath, and not the cause, of the fire, being the product of fire damage to the insulation of the service wires sufficient to cause short circuits, which in turn blew the fuses on the transformer pole. What he said was not disputed, but on the other hand the testimony of appellants tended to corroborate him.
They had, since the original wiring was installed in the hotel premises, added a walk-in freezer unit and air conditioning equipment, which latter gave them so much trouble taht they had installed three additional towers to make the equipment work more efficiently. The trouble they experienced with bulbs burning out and fuses blowing on the hotel premises was, without dispute, attributable to their own overloading of the electrical wiring in the hotel. Without question, the trouble began within the hotel premises; and its own protective devices had operated to shut off all of the lighting within them; and the fire had been in progress some time befor there was any arcing or flashing near or upon the wires of appellee.
From the whole record it is clear that appellants failed to introduce substantial evidence of negligence to make a case concerning which reasonable minds might reach different conclusions. They have produced no proof which tends to establish that any negligence on the part of the appellee caused the fire or contributed to its spread. In a long line of cases this Court has held that 'speculation cannot supply the place of proof.' Theriot v. Mercer, 1956, 262 F.2d 754, 759; Smith v General Motors Corp., 1955, 227 F.2d 210; McNamara v. American Motors Corp., 1957, 247 F.2d 445; E. I. duPont De Nemours & Co. v. Kissinger, 1958, 259 F.2d 411, certiorari denied 359 U.S. 950, 79 S.Ct. 736, 3 L.Ed.2d 683; and Nashville Bridge Co. v. Ritch, 1960, 276 F.2d 171.
In this case no such proof was made and no circumstance points to the probability that further proof will be turned up. Substantially a year elapsed between the time of the fire and the beginning of this action, and two years between the time the action was begun and the time of its submission. The parties have developed their respective contentions by taking the depositions of both appellants and of all of the employees of appellee who had any knowledge of or dealings with appellants' and appellee's electrical installations at and near the damaged premises or of the facts attending the fire. Under these circumstances I think that the curt below was justified in disposing of the case under summary judgment procedures in the manner and for the reasons set forth in Footnote 1 supra. Cf. Chambers & Co. v. Equitable Life Assurance Society of the United States, 5 Cir., 1955, 224 F.2d 338, 339; Whitaker v. Coleman, 5 Cir., 1940, 115 F.2d 305; King v. California Co., 5 Cir., 1955, 224 F.2d 193; Inglett & Co. v. Everglades Fertilizer Co., 5 Cir., 1958, 255 F.2d 342; and Dyal v. Union BagCamp Paper Corp., 5 Cir., 1959, 263 F.2d 387.
I am not unfamiliar with the fact that there is a disposition on the part of some courts to rule summary judgment out as a remedy in negligence cases. I do not see any justification for such an attitude. Indeed, a large proportion of the cases coming before us involve negligence. If, from the depositions and affidavits placed before a court, it is clear that those claiming negligence have not proven it according to legal standards, I think that summary judgment ought to be entered in a negligence cae to the same extent that it is in any other case.
Nor do I adhere to the concept sometimes found in court opinions that summary judgment ought to be denied because from the whole record it looks as if the party opposing it might be able to find some evidence to raise an isue of fact. On the other hand, I think it is clear from all of the authorities that the duty rests upon one against whom summary judgment is sought to bring forward competent proof developing an issue with the facts which have been adduced, under legal standards, by the person seeking summary judgment. The Rules themselves, in my opinion, make such an attitude mandatory.4
In this case both parties have 'milked the cow dry.' The case has been pending a long time. There is, in my opinion, no indication that the appellants can ever improve upon the testimony they placed before the court. In my opinion, the testimony justifies the granting of a summary judgment, and the opinion of the majority tends to emasculate the summary judgment rule as a mechanism for shortening the tedious proceedings by which justice is methed out. I therefore respectfully dissent.
'* * * Plaintiffs' complaint consists of three counts. * * *
'The material allegations of the First Count are that defendant Power Company negligence failed to cut off the current after it was notified of fire at plaintiffs' premises, resulting in the destruction of plaintiffs' property by fire.
'The plaintiffs do not charge the defendant with any responsibility for the origin of the fire in this Count.
'The depositions and affidavits relied upon by defendant in support of its motion in this regard are in no way disputed by any of the documents relied upon by plaintiffs. It affirmatively appears in regard to this issue as to whether or not the defendant negligently failed to cut off power promptly after notification by the plaintiffs that the facts are not in dispute. The plaintiffs in their depositions aver that the defendant's servicemen were slow in arriving at the scene, but it is not disputed that the power was already off, and there is no showing that the defendant could, or should, have cut off the power sooner than was accomplished prior thereto by safety mechanisms. This being so, there is not even the possibility of inference that the exertion of more diligence by defendant would have prevented or mitigated the damage. * * *
'Even placing upon the defendant, as the law does, the duty of extraordianry care in the operation of its business and considering the matter here on motion for summary judgment most stringently against the lmvant, the court concludes nevertheless that there is not even the modicum of evidence necessary to submit a material question of fact to the jury and that defendant's motion for summary judgment should be granted.
'In reaching this conclusion, the court has considered most carefully the case of Yelverton v. Adams, decided by the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit and reported in 262 F.2d 146. (Here the court below quoted from the decision in the Yelverton case.)
'In the case before this court, we do not have merely strained evidence in support of plaintiffs' contention, we do not have merely weak evidence in its probative force, we simply do not have any substantial evidence of any nature which could give rise even to an inference, from substantial evidence, conjecture or otherwise, that the fire here was due to the negligence of the defendant. In Yelverton there was at least some proof of a jumper wire or other specific condition that the power company in that situation was charged with having failed to detect upon inspection, or having failed to remedy after complaint. Here plaintiffs and their witnesses merely describe certain electrical phenomena from which they wish the jury to be permitted to infer that some unidentifiable dangerous condition existed, further infer that the defendant was responsible for the condition, and still further infer that this condition caused the fire.
'The entire burden of all the evidence before the court in this case compels the court to the view that there is a very obvious distinction between the two cases. To hold otherwise would be to submit to a jury conjecture, inference, speculation without even a jumping off place ot reach some kind of a verdit. The mere fact that premises are burned to which electrical current is supplied, standing alone, cannot be the basis for an action in negligence against the supplier of the current thereto. * * *'
'The appellants are unable to pinpoint the exact cause of the fire, except that it can be reasonably inferred from their testimony that there were some defects in Gulf Power Company's equipment which caused dangerous amounts of electrical current to come into the hotel, starting the fire and preventing the appellants from extinguishing the said fire. There is also evidence that the Gulf Power Company delayed unreasonably in cutting the current off, and closely connected with that theory of recovery is the proposition that the power company was negligent infailing to provide the consumer an adequate protective devise which would operate to cut off the current in event trouble such as this developed.'
E.g., Rule 56(c) providing.'
Rule 56(e) provides:
'Supporting and opposing affidavits shall be made on personal knowledge, shall set forth such facts as would be admissible in evidence, and shall show affirmatively that the affiant is competent to testify to the matters stated therein. * * *'
And Rule 56(f) provides:
'Should it appear from the affidavits.'Review: Nexus 10 tablet is a solid choice for the price

Abstract
Endothelial cells respond to hypoxic changes with resultant accumulation of several metabolites and switch over to angiogenic phenotype. Although certain intermediates of glycolytic and oxidative metabolic pathways have been known to affect angiogenesis, the effect of citrate, which accumulates in certain tumors, on angiogenesis is not known. Therefore, the effect of citrate on angiogenesis was studied using different model systems. Increased vascularization in chorioallantoic membrane assay, increased endothelial sprouting in rat aortic rings, and increased expression of CD31, E-selectin in endothelial cells suggested a possible proangiogenic effect of citrate. Upregulation of angiogenic factors such as vascular endothelial growth factor and fibroblast growth factor suggested that the effect of citrate involves modulation of expression of angiogenic growth factors. LY 294002, an inhibitor of PI3K–Akt pathway, and wortmannin, an inhibitor of Akt pathway, reversed the effect of citrate in human umbilical vein endothelial cells. Citrate induced significant upregulation and activation of Akt in endothelial cells. Rapamycin, an inhibitor of mTOR, also reversed the effect of citrate in human umbilical vein endothelial cells and sprouting of aortic rings suggesting that the angiogenic effect of citrate involves activation of PI3K–Akt–mTOR pathway.

worked with 6.1 would now fail on the first pass because it could not find

If I ran the make file with clean and then tried to compile it would fail
again on the first try and succeed on the second. I verified that the
headers were there.
I then added the path to the make file ( /usr/include/cpp). Now it compiles
properly the first time. It seems that some internal setting with the
compiler is not being set properly. Has anybody else seen this problem?

Sure, the stock is up over 20% since announcing Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) guru Marissa Mayer as its fifth CEO in five years, it’s up 32% from its late August lows while the market is basically flat since then, and it’s at its highest levels since early 2010.
But why?
Trading China Growth for an EPS Boost
Yahoo! won a big $4.3 billion after-tax payday by selling half its stake in Alibaba … but as Jonathan Berr wrote back in May, the deal is akin to selling the family silver to make your monthly bills.
I find it hard to understand why Yahoo! has a better outlook now that it bailed out of this fast-growing market to mainly fund a big buyback. Bigger earnings might be in store for 2013 simply thanks to a trick of math — with earnings constant but fewer shares, the EPS number naturally inflates.
That’s hardly a strategy for growth.
No Fundamental Improvement
The Alibaba sale might have juiced profits, but the fundamentals remain ugly. Through Q3, Yahoo! has seen quarterly revenue decline year-over-year in seven of the past eight quarters. You simply can’t make more profits if you aren’t growing sales.
Well, that’s not true. You can slash and burn, and sell your big-ticket assets. But with Alibaba gone and the money earmarked for buybacks, CEO Marissa Mayer better figure out how to move that top line higher in a hurry, or she’ll need to add actual job cuts on top of pay cuts.
Content Is King
The lack of revenue comes from a multifaceted problem: Namely, the decline of “portal” pages as a destination and the importance of content as a driver of traffic.
Fewer web surfers are going to portals like Yahoo! and AOL (NYSE:AOL) as their default destination for news or messaging. For proof of this, consider that Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) has had a commanding lead over Yahoo! in the display advertising market for a while.
To replace this lost baseline traffic, both AOL and Yahoo! both have been forced into the content business with results that are mixed at best. And unfortunately, while there is some good original content on both Yahoo and AOL’s Huffington Post, there also is a painful over-reliance on third-party content.
That’s a bad long-term plan for two reasons: One, advertisers always have the option to target this content elsewhere; and two, content creators can only be assuaged by the intangible “compensation” of exposure for so long as they enrich these larger sites.
Yahoo! admittedly has some good content; I personally love.
The biggest question in the mobile age is how to monetize mobile users, and thus far, nobody has a good answer for display advertising on tablets and smartphones. That means even if Yahoo! can figure out how to get more traffic from mobile devices, it still won’t result in a net gain for earnings because the profitability isn’t equal across the two platforms.
Countless articles point to the fact that scale and revenue have been the goal of mobile advertisers, but profits remain very elusive. (Here’s a good one by Business Insider’s Jim Edwards that points out continued big-time revenue growth at Millenial Media (NYSE:MM), but a continued lack of any profits.)
What Strategy?
Here we arrive at the hardest truth of all: A lack of real strategy. ‘double-digit million-dollar’ acquisitions.”
Mayer is going to save Yahoo with a $50 million buyout of … what, really? That’s like saying you’re setting off with a $20 bill to find parts for your broken-down space shuttle.
Furthermore, a buyout craze could smack of desperation — Hewlett-Packard (NYSE:HPQ), anyone? — but I guess in the absence of a real strategy, buyouts are as good a smokescreen as any.
On the Other Hand …
There are positive headlines to be sure. So, for balance, it’s worth noting that:
- Yahoo! has spent almost $1 billion on buybacks so far in 2012, and many are enthusiastic about future buybacks boosting the stock. As I mentioned, I’m skeptical … but as the recent rally shows, you can’t fight the tape.
- Yahoo!, of course, didn’t wholly sell out of Alibaba … it still has upside in its remaining stake.
- Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) just upgraded the stock with a price target of $24 partially because of this fact. Though you have to wonder why a smaller stake is good, but a bigger stake didn’t boost shares earlier this year …
- As for the buyout plan, there admittedly might be value in so-called “acqui-hires” where Yahoo! basically snaps up an upstart company for the talent — not the practical use of the actual company. This is common practice in Silicon Valley.
-.
Still, I remain convinced that the cons ultimately will outweigh the pros.
If you’ve ridden Yahoo! up lately, good for you. But I think it’s time to get out before the music stops.

Two Score 2013-14 Box Breaks
I guess they didn't want to have to deal with all the players changing teams after the free agent frenzy began...
The first thing that struck me was its price tag: at $55, it was nearly double what I was used to spending on their 36-pack box in previous seasons; on the other hand pack sizes increased by 40% (as is clearly stated on the front of the box), going from 7 cards per pack to 12. I decided to get two boxes anyway, as that was my habit. Also, after not getting a single autograph card last year in two full boxes and some 70 extra single-purchase packs, I was more than happy that they went back to ''guaranteeing'' a signed card in every box.
This year's regular set contains 550 cards, plus 30 ''Team Leaders'' cards, 10 ''highlights'', 60 Hot Rookies (last year's rookies AND this year's), 59 Hot Rookies autographs (with a different design from the regular rookie cards), 25 ''Check-It'' hard-hitters cards, 20 of the First Goal variety, 10 ''Team Score'' and 15 ''Future Team Score'', 20 Net Cams, 20 ''Recollection Collection'' autographs of past legends on old designs, 39 Score Signature autograph cards, 48 Team 8s jersey cards, as well as 30 The Franchise and 10 The Future Franchise cards. View the complete checklist here. No ''Award Winners'' this year, but then again, there wasn't a ceremony. An action shot of each player would still have made for a nice card, though.
The wrappers are foil, reminiscent of the very first Upper Deck packs in the early 1990s:
Here are the backs:
Here is how the first box broke down:
36 packs, 12 cards per: 432 cards
Regular cards: 349
'Gold' parallel: 40 (including two Hot Rookie, one Season Highlights and one Team Leaders)
Hot Rookies: 23 'normal' ones plus the two 'gold' versions, four big names (Viktor Fasth, Vladimir Tarasenko (regular and gold), Dougie Hamilton and Emerson Etem), and two Habs - Jarred Tinordi and Nathan Beaulieu (regular and gold).
The Franchise: 2, Patrick Kane and Shea Weber.
Net Cam: 2, Cory Schneider and Carey Price.
First Goal: 1, Alex Galchenyuk.
Team Score: 1, Claude Giroux.
Season Highlight: 4
Team Leaders: 9
Autograph: 1 (will feature soon!)
Montréal Canadiens (my home team): 10 regular ones, plus both recent acquisitions Daniel Brière and George Parros, plus the two/three rookies, the Net Cam, the Team Leaders and Galchenyuk's First Goal.
------------------------
Here is a breakdown of the second box:
36 packs, 12 cards per: 432 cards
Regular cards: 348
'Gold' parallel: 40 (including two Hot Rookie, one Season Highlights and one Team Leaders, and 9 wearing a Canadiens uniform)
Hot Rookies: 23 regular ones (plus the two gold), no Habs, but four big names: Nail Yakupov, Filip Forsberg, Mikhail Grigorenko, and Mikael Granlund.
The Franchise: 2: Taylor Hall, and new retiree Miikka Kirpusoff.
Net Cam: 2, seemingly taken in the same game:
Team Score: 1, Alex Pietrangelo.
Check-It: 1, Dougie Hamilton.
Season Highlight: 4 - the exact same four as the first box!
Team Leaders: 9
Montréal Canadiens (my home team): 14, including two departed players (Michael Ryder and Tomas Kaberle), plus new tough guy Parros in his Florida Panthers garb.
Hot Rookies Autograph: 1 (featured soon!)
---------
Panini guaranteed a black variant in every box, but I got none - in two. Don't mind at all.
This remains my favourite product of the season, slightly ahead of UD's Victory. The number of players available is only surpassed by O-Pee-Chee, but the pictures and multitudes of sub-sets (rather than multitudes of parallel cards) rank it far higher.
Of course, this is all regarding the lower-end products, affordable to all, but I feel these are the most important products on the market, first because they can introduce kids to the hobby with a large number of cheap cards, but also because you can afford to keep up with the set's evolution throughout the years without busting your budget. Lastly, because I don't mind shelling out $30-60 bucks for 400+ cards and an autograph I view as a bonus, compared to spending over $100 for less than 10 cards and ending up with 'hits' of guys who'll never play 100 games in the NHL (or when they do, will never score 20 goals in their careers); I don't mind getting those as commons, but HATE getting them as 'hits'.
Posted by Sébastian Hell at 10:44 AM
those were retail boxes you got... hobby boxes sell for around $100-$105 and have 12 packs with 52 cards in each pack. Each hobby box has two autos and a 8 player relic card.
I'm assuming you're keeping all of the Habs, if not I'm interested. I'm also interested in any Blues you got.
Thanks for the info. You've been emailed!
If you're still interested in the stuff from my boxes, shoot me an email (jonkatje at hotmail dot com) and let me know, I have it all set aside. Sorry it took so long to get back to you, I went on a quick vacation.

As far as goals go I did finish the anniversary dress, and I got as far as cutting out the fabric of my skirt. I was going to try to finish that as well, but I thought I might send my mother over the edge since (as I said before) I just started packing this evening. I should have started awhile ago, but I was determined to finish this dress. I also had many other things I had to attend to before I left. Loose ends to tie up and people to see, I was a very busy lady, hence no posts or finished goals.
Since I did not finish three of my goals, I now have to pay the price. I must give up some of my stash. Luckily for me, Laurel is on vacation. But, when she gets back she has my permission to pick two pieces of fabric and I think one pattern. These I will post (with her pics) and have someone state-side send them out.
Although....was all this inevitable? Should I give myself a little leniency? Was it lunacy at the start to think I could do all that before moving to Rome?! I will leave my stash's fate in your hands. I know at least one piece should go, I do think that is fair. But three...?! Now faced with parting, it is so hard. What do you think? Am I being too hard on myself? Or do you all just want free fabric? ;)
If you want in on a piece of the action, at least in the running for the first piece, leave a comment on this post before September 5 before 11:59 pm EST. I will randomly choose someone that will inherit some fantastic new fabric. That is this coming Sunday, which should give me time to mourn my fabric ;) But, I guess if it is going into the hands of someone who will use it, that is better!
Right?
I do feel bad that you're giving up some of the stash, but on the other hand I'd love to win a piece of it...I hope I win!
Well, as of right now, you are the only one in the running! I will give it until midnight, but this might be the easiest win for you ever :)
Hey don't feel bad, I hosted a giveaway on my blog and no one entered. I've never won anything on a blog contest so this would make me very happy...besides I have no nice fabric most of it is from the walmart dollar bin1:33 minutes

Marriage, Sex and How to Work with the Creative Forces
Dear Disciple:Dear Disciple:
Married Disciples who have achieved the exercising of the sexual functions as a sacred act or as a religious operation in their matrimony have obtained a great advantage since both beings in this way can mutually help each other.
In general each one of our Disciples must have a spouse in order to perform the duties of marriage but up to now they have done nothing but squander their values and even life itself when they could have gained eternal youth.
Let us not forget that the sensation of coitus is much too short enough to lead the performer to boredom apathy and annoyance like a form of sickening sadness and often we must force ourselves to become magnetically charged in order to feel the romantic attraction for each other.
Ovid has already said: “Post coitum omnia animalia tristia” [“All animals are sad after intercourse”].Ovid has already said: “Post coitum omnia animalia tristia” [“All animals are sad after intercourse”].
Animals only seek this instant (for the final goal of impregnation) at the precise time in which the female is in heat and demands to be fertilized but man (the sublime animal, the angelic-being) is the only one who repeats this function every day in order to go about slowly draining himself of his values and he does so without consciousness…
Catalysis is what we call an accelerating action that exercises certain substances upon other substances in order to increase or decrease the speed of their chemical reactions and if we transfer this idea of catalysis to the field of parapsychism then we can already begin to count on the verification of the sexual functions as an exchange of their forces.
The Pelvis in women pours feminine currents while the breasts give masculine currents. In a man the radical feminine current is in the mouth and the masculine current is in his virile member.
All these organs as a consequence must be excited with the purpose of giving and receiving transmitting and collecting and then one should provoke the currents more and more that are now flowing looking for quantity and quality.
Dancing and kissing (which put the couple in intimate contact with each other) are none other than an intuitive manifestation in order to achieve this Magnetization between man and woman.
Here in Germany and in many other countries there have been societies which cultivated nudity and even nude dancing. This has served many times for immoral excesses and it is good that it has been prohibited..
Before in the Initiations of ancient Mexico young people of both sexes united for months completely naked who were allowed to mutually embrace each other without ever reaching the carnal act or orgasm.
The awakened passion must be dominated so that once all the glandular juices are in their zenith, they can be transmuted into spiritual strength.
-Paraphrase from Zodical Course (1931) by Arnoldo Krumm-Heller
available in Gnostic Rosicrucian Astrology
Scorpio, the Magical Key, and Divine Magnetization
In our book “the ROSE-CROSS” we said that in this instant the Semen is cerebrized while the Cerebrum is seminized… the key to which lies in what we have already explained.
Our Disciples who are in Rose-Cross marriages should ignore what others do and keep this secret so that we are the privileged, the supermen and women, those of character. This seems to be a selfish act, but certain Keys should not be disclosed to people who are going through a purely materialized life and have not done the Rose Cross practices.
Instead of coitus which reaches orgasm one should reflexively lavish one’s partner with sweet caresses amorous phrases and delicate touchings maintaining the mind constantly separated from animal sexuality sustaining the most pure spirituality as if the act were a true religious ceremony.
Nevertheless the man can and must introduce the Penis and maintain it in the feminine sexual organ so that for both of them a divine sensation full of joy ensues (which can last for hours) withdrawing at the moment in which the spasm approaches in order to avoid the ejaculation of semen. In this way each time they will have a greater yearning to caress each other
This can be repeated as many times as one wants without ever becoming fatigued because on the contrary this is the Magical Key in order to be rejuvenated daily to keep the body healthy and to prolong life since it is a source of health with this constant Magnetization.
We know that with ordinary Magnetism: the Magnetizer communicates magnetic currents to the subject, and if the first has these magnetic forces developed then they are able to heal the second.
The transmission of the magnetic current is ordinarily done via the hands or via the eyes but it is necessary to say that there is no more powerful conductor than the virile member and the vulva which are a thousand times more powerful a thousand times superior to others as organs of reception.
If many people practice this then they spread strength and success to all those who are put into commercial or social contact with them.
But in the act of sublime and Divine Magnetization to which we are referring; both man and woman magnetize each other reciprocally being one for the other as a musical instrument which (when being plucked) gives off or starts prodigious sounds of sweet and mystical harmony.
The strings of this instrument are spread over the whole body and their principal buttons are the lips and the fingers provided that absolute purity presides over the act and this is what makes us Magicians in that supreme instant.
Obtain a good accumulation of forces at their boiling point and say:
“I AM STRENGTH, I AM STRENGTH, I CAN HAVE EVERYTHING THAT I WANT”
[“YO SOY FUERZA, YO SOY FUERZA, YO PUEDO TODO CUANTO QUIERO”]
and then direct the Mind towards whatever it is that you want to achieve.
Let us repeat, as we did in our other Works, that we have the right to comfort wealth and power, provided that it is not to the detriment of others and, on the contrary, that it is to the benefit of others. The general utility is above the particular.
Keep this secret and work according to what your Inner Being advises you to do.

The Door of Triumph and the Great Fecundator
We have arrived at the last Glands of the Septenary which we have followed. We started with the Epiphysis or Pineal gland and by recommending the path of LIGHT, LOVE, LIFE, LIBERTY AND TRIUMPH and if the Disciple has consciously done the practices then they have been able to find the final door that of TRIUMPH.
We also recommended concentrating oneself upon the Source of Light upon one’s interior source repeating each time “I AM, I CAN” [“YO SOY, YO PUEDO”]. This was the Fighter in the practice corresponding to Aries dominated by Mars.
Today we reach (from the opposite direction) the dominion of the same planet Mars but in Scorpio who rules the sexual parts. In the ancient Initiations they called the Scorpion THE GREAT FECUNDATOR.
The terrestrial current comes from the sexual parts which only has slight opposition in the knees and in the joints of the feet before colliding and mixing itself with those heavenly currents which have gone through so many screens until finally reaching the testicles and ovaries
Now we are looking after the great laboratory where the fate of everything is determined. All of Creation is governed by two forces that from above (positive) and that from below (receptive).
Based in Love one repeats the same activity emitting and receiving the two poles represented here by the man (positive principle) and the women (receptive principle).
There is an intimate secret then in the mental plane through our action the woman converts herself into the positive principle and the man converts himself into the receptive principle, this transformation transcends sex.
That is to say an androgynous tendency in us where both principles fight each other which makes us comprehend the Laws of the Biorhythm.
We have already seen that in our Liquid Nervous System we consist of masculine and feminine Glands (see our book “Biorhythm”) which vibrate in a constant cycle of action and reaction ascent and descent augmentation and diminuation and that Mars operates in this fight and that within us its outpouring is in the constellation of Scorpio.
-Paraphrase from Zodical Course (1931) by Arnoldo Krumm-Heller
available in Gnostic Rosicrucian Astrology
Life, Death, and our Glands
In Astrology Scorpio is the 8th House. This is the House of Death and statistics prove that the majority of beings die when the constellation of Scorpio is acting. This is because we have lost the Key to managing Scorpio.
Let’s remember that in Scorpio is the action and function of the sexual organs whose passional power can only be compared with a lively steed who pulls the chariot of our life.
While we have our hands firmly on the reins of this steed we can dominate it while hopping and jumping and infuriating the proud but the day that these reins are gone, the animal runs wild and goes off at a full gallop: turning our chariot around and dragging us through the rocks and the mud of the road until we are exhausted and dead. Behold the cause of many deaths in this Constellation.
But Death and Life are intimately linked and depending on whether we can overcome the evil effects of Mars in Scorpio we can thereby emerge triumphant in Life attracting new Life and new vigor the Key is this.
Throughout our whole body a portion of Little Glands are distributed which are more or less large or small such as the sweat and sebaceous glands that are in the skin by the millions each one of them is of a masculine or feminine character.
These Little Glands (in their intimacy) are individual accumulators of Magnetic Forces with their respective currents seeking in every instant for the masculine collision with the feminine and vice versa as if they were in a constant exchange of positive and negative principles.
This exchange which is prolonged until a divine sublime state is reached is nothing other than Love. But these forces are dormant, sleeping and it is our duty to wake them up and to excite them or provoke them and unite Man –as the positive principle– and Woman –as the receptive principle– in a mutual agreement and harmony so that both can realize the Great Operation of Sexual Magic.
We do this for 22 erotic points on our organism.
I observed that many women are copiously excited if one touches the edges of the ears; others are excited by touching the nipples, however the excitement is not local but includes the entire body. It is the same in man, who also has his erotic points. The latter is excitable by touching the chest which is his feminine part, while women have their clitoris as their masculine excitable part.
In this letter we have exposed a lot putting every word clearly and accurately in place so that our Disciples comprehend and take charge of what this practice is and so that they take care to do it as best they can.
We only desire that the comprehension is correct between everyone and that you do things properly to our wishes.
I insist that this letter should not be desecrated and that nobody should teach it to another.
It is strictly personal and one commits an indiscretion an evil action which never goes unpunished karmically if one were to share it.
In addition it is not complete. In the course about Magic we will return to this subject

The Rose-Cross Fraternity, White Tantra, and Gnosis
Although Huiracocha says this secret should not be shared with just any body, in the 1950s, the key of White Tantra was given to the public by Samael Aun Weor. Let’s look at how this “secret” passed from Huiracocha’s FRA to Samael Aun Weor’s Gnostic Movement.
Sometime between 1906 and 1912, Huiracocha published “No Fornicarás” [“Do not Fornicate”] with a simplified presentation of some of the themes of tantric sexual magic. The book was referenced in the Revista Rosacruz [Rose Cross Magazine] of June 1930:
“If the Rose Cross brethren seek gnostic works in libraries, provided that the caretakers of the books have not followed the example of St. Jerome (burning everything that smacks of sexual issues) they will find true wonders, as I have found, because the Gnostics were those who gave me my key of Sexual Magic.
Some theosophists have called me a black magician because I occupy myself with these studies, but in this field all can agree that in terms of sexual magic I am an authority, and that I have occupied myself for many years with that discipline, publishing more than twenty years ago, my first book ‘Do not fornicate’, which at that time attracted much attention. Today it is only found in libraries.”
Then between December 1932 and March 1933, Huiracocha published a number of articles in this same Magazine discussing some concepts about the ‘Astral Light’ (called Light and More Light) and ‘Tantra’ (see the articles of the same name Parts 1 and 2).
Samael Aun Weor studied at an FRA school in Columbia, where he received the Key of Alchemy and, starting in 1950, he began publishing information about the sexual mysteries, in his book El Matrimonio Perfecto [The Perfect Matrimony] (1950).
Huiracocha’s Practice for Scorpio
The practice given for this sign is to practice White Tantra with our spouse. If we do not have that luxury, then we can perform a single’s transmutation practice, such as Pranayama or Ham-Sah.

Halloween ranks second behind the Fourth of July in the number of pets who escape due to doors opening and closing for trick-or-treaters.
Also, Halloween treats can be deadly for pets, especially the sugarfree and chocolaty ones.
Here are some tips that all pet owners should follow to ensure their pets' safety:
1. Make sure all pets are wearing collars and are micro-chipped. This service is available at the HSSA Spay and Neuter Clinic for $20.
2. Make sure Halloween costumes don't cover your pet's eyes. A costume must never be binding and should only be worn for a short time.
3. Halloween treats are for humans only. Chocolate and sugarfree candies can be toxic. Keep all candy out of your pet's reach.
4. Dogs can have lethal tails, wagging all over the place. Don't leave any lit candles or jack-o-lanterns where they could be knocked over.
5. Pets should be kept in a separate room during trick-or-treat hours. Not only will this keep them safe but it will also help reduce your pet's stress.
6. Don't leave your pet out in the yard on Halloween. There are plenty of stories of vicious pranksters who have teased, injured, stolen, and even killed pets on this night.
Frightened pets can end up miles from home in a very short time. If your pet becomes lost, immediately file a lost and found report with the HSSA.

Aarhus is situated on the East Coast of Jutland and combines a blend of Scandinavian charm, European style and Jutlandic humour. Retaining its status from the 70s as Denmark’s “City of Music”, Aarhus has continued to grow its well-deserved reputation for nurturing and supporting the arts with theatres, museums, galleries and music venues popping up throughout the city.
The picturesque streets of the inner city have a tempting café scene, while there is also an array of good restaurants and an opportunity to relax in some of the cosiest pubs in Europe. Whether you go shopping in the city’s main thoroughfare or in the narrow, winding alleys of the Latin Quarter, you are sure to be spoilt for choice.
If museums are more your thing than shopping, you will be impressed by Aarhus’s recent and most impressive development, the Aros Museum of Modern Art. Opened in 2004, this striking modernist white building has put Aarhus firmly on the map as a city of art and culture.
One of the largest and most architecturally impressive museums in Northern Europe, Aros Museum of Modern Art houses the largest collection of art in Denmark outside Copenhagen. The collection spans some 300 years, from traditional Danish to contemporary international works of art. Ever evolving, the museum’s newest installation on the roof, “Sky Space” by the Danish artist Olafur Eliasson, is due to open within the next year or two.
In addition to this art powerhouse, Aarhus’s smaller modern galleries and handicraft workshops, showcase an inspiring collection of works from world-renowned to young contemporary artists. Covering everything from paintings, ceramics, glass and textiles to handmade jewellery, many are run and owned by the artists providing the unique opportunity to meet the person behind the works of art.
However, if less static art is more to your liking, you won’t be disappointed. Resonating throughout the various concert halls, music venues and local cafes, Aarhus caters to a wide variety of music lovers with everything from opera and jazz to rock and hip-hop.
Building on its standing as the “City of Music”, Aarhus also plays host to a number of internationally acclaimed festivals including the popular SPOT festival in June, Aarhus International Jazz Festival in July and Scandinavia’s largest hip hop festival ‘Aarhus Took It’ in October.
Once your thirst for music has been quenched, why not check out some of the theatre action that Aarhus has to offer? Choosing what to see could be your biggest problem though, as there are more than 30 theatres in the city offering a greatly varied and colourful theatrical programme. From classical performances at the Helsingor Theatre— Denmark’s oldest theatre—to more experimental acts from Teater Gruppe 38, there is something to suit all tastes and ages. For a real treat, book a prime seat in the lavishly adorned Aarhus Theatre, with its extravagantly decorated interior, or in one of the eight auditoriums at the city’s sparkling palace-like glass Concert Hall, Musikhuset Aarhus.
With so much to see and do, an excellent way of experiencing all the arts is to stay during Aarhus Festival Week. Running from mid-August to the first week in September, the festival is themed differently each year and covers everything from theatre performances, concerts, opera and ballet to sport. Alternatively, in October, a condensed version, aptly named the “Night of Culture”, offers visitors the unique opportunity to visit buildings and institutions, which are normally closed to the public, to see a selection of musical and theatre performances, poetry readings and art exhibitions all in one night.
Complemented by an excellent range of restaurants, cafes and bars, Aarhus is the perfect
weekend escape to have your fill of art in a city that is sure to satisfy the hungriest of appetites.

His 88 steered New Zealand to a resounding six-wicket win with 7.2 overs to spare, making 203 for four in the opening ODI against Bangladesh.
The squad for the first test against Bangladesh will be named on Sunday. He missed the two tests in South Africa a few weeks ago but despite an ordinary test record, averaging 14 in six tests, he deserves another chance.
Yesterday he drove impeccably and, as he gained in assurance, his strokeplay flourished. On other days he might have gone leg before to the second ball of the innings from Mashrafe Mortaza, missing an attempted pull, but got better as he went along.
How's innings of 90 and 76 in South Africa during the ODI series attracted attention but he lost his way in Australia, although he wasn't alone in that.
Yesterday there were good partnerships, including one of 90 with Brendon McCullum - full of rumbustious strokes until inexplicably spooning a full toss back to the bowler Farhad Reza - and 67 with Peter Fulton, who got to 35 comfortably before holing out to deep cover.
But How wasted a royal opportunity for his maiden ODI hundred, slicing left arm spinner Shakib Al Hasan high to long off.
There were some untidy moments in the New Zealand innings, and wickets were conceded softly, but the important point was that it was a win, and batsmen had a chance in more comfortable circumstances than they've enjoyed recently to feel the bat on ball.
The innings of the day, however, in terms of splashing colour all over Eden Park, came from Bangladesh's captain, Mohammad Ashraful. He shared an excellent 97-run stand for the third wicket with 18-year-old opener Tamim Iqbal which threatened to put some real heat on New Zealand's batsmen.
It took only 91 balls, and was easily a Bangladesh record against New Zealand for any wicket. The pair had the wood on New Zealand's bowlers before falling in quick order to poorly judged shots.
By the time Iqbal, having just completed his third ODI 50, sliced to third man, they had taken Bangladesh to 136 in the 27th over and were toying with the New Zealand attack. A target well in excess of 250 beckoned.
Iqbal was circumspect early but tucked in later on. But Ashraful is this team's standout performer. Short but fearless, he averages only 22 in ODIs, but clearly believes backward steps are for ballroom dancing.
There's a degree of hit or miss to his batting, but when he's on he is well worth the admission, and yesterday he arrived at the crease with his team's hopes squarely on his shoulders.
Based on what followed from the Bangladeshi middle and lower order, this is a situation with which he's not entirely unfamiliar.
In what seemed no time, he had flown to 25 off his first 12 balls. He pulled ferociously, drove with class and on a couple of occasions produced audacious flicks high to the fine leg boundary from outside offstump, shots requiring nerve and skill.
Much of his strokeplay had a dismissive quality to it. But the departures of Iqbal and Ashraful in quick succession had the effect of pulling the bathplug.
Ashraful, having completed his 12th ODI 50, was aghast to find he had swung Oram straight to deep mid wicket, his 70 having taken only 57 balls.
Five wickets fell in the space of 33 balls. And what's more, the runs dried up.
New Zealand's bowlers, largely - and worryingly - ineffective when the big stand was in progress, did stick at the job.
But Martin, Mills, Oram and Gillespie all had good patches. Patches, however, don't always win matches.CULTURE BLOG
ADVENTURE BY BIKE®
This is the fourth in a series of posts about a group of Fort Lewis College students attempting to ride self-supported a portion of the Arizona Trail over their Spring Break in early March…
Click here for Part One. Click here for Part Two. Click here for Part Three. Click here for Part Four.
With another day of blue skies overhead, a suitable route to reconnect with the trail found, and a new of burst energy (from the junk food). All of the members of the team except for two decided to push on into the unknown. Besides Katelyn, Devin decided that he had received what he had wanted from the experience and was content to end his trip at that point. The remaining six members of the group were eager to get riding and finish the journey. Within minutes of the decision we topped off our water supplies, refilled our bottles of denatured alcohol, ate a few more snacks, and then were pedaling north on a gravel road paralleling the San Pedro River. We were on the road again.
With the decision made to continue—it was mini-resupply time...
Our map showed a gravel road that would take us to the Gila River and then intersect the AZT at a bridge over the river in the small community of Kelvin. From there we would get to ride the final 40 miles of singletrack to the Picketpost Trailhead. This section of the AZT, known as the Gila Canyons, was supposed to be particularly spectacular and bike friendly. As we rode north, the viability of our route choice started to come into question. First, there was the gate and sign that stated that our road was going to dead end in eight miles. This was a few miles short of Kelvin. After double-checking the GPS to make sure we were on the correct route, we opened the gate and proceeded on down the road. Four miles later we encountered another gate with another sign stating that the road would end in four miles. Too stubborn to be denied or turn around we pushed on. Before long we were paralleling the Gila River and could see the town of Kearney on the opposite side of the river from us. Passing through numerous gates, our road slowly began to deteriorate. It truly was going to end. A change in plan was needed. We needed to find a way to get across the river to Kearney where we could ride on Hwy 77 for a few miles before dropping down another gravel road to Kelvin.
At the top of a little bluff overlooking the Gila, I spotted a woman on an ATV fording the river from Kearney. That would be our crossing point. Five minutes later, at what would be our final gate, we met the ATVer. She said we could easily cross the river and make our way into Kearney. Wahoo! Within minutes I was pedaling into the chocolate muddy waters of the Gila hoping I could make it across without having to swim. Needless to say, I didn’t make a successful landing on the other side while still pedaling, but the just above the knee wade was refreshing and easily doable. It was lunchtime and we had covered just under 20 miles for the day. Yea!

After a brief stop at Buzzy’s to fulfill our urge for ice cream, we were riding west in a paceline on the small shoulder of Hwy 77. Within a few miles we were off of the busy highway and descending on a gravel road to Kelvin and the AZT. Once at the trail we began climbing on some of the most beautiful and pleasant singletrack we had encountered on our journey thus far. It was super sweet as it climbed up and contoured above the river. The trail flowed among the giant saguaros standing as sentries along the mountainsides. The views into the carved out river valley combined with the trailside blooming flowers made our late afternoon ride the most enjoyable of the trip. We rode into the sunset relishing in the decision to continue on. It would have been a real shame to have missed this section of trail. After riding 17 miles of very enjoyable singletrack and covering 40 total miles for the day, we made camp near the river where the AZT turns north leaving the Gila behind to head towards Superior. The crew was exhausted, but everyone was in good spirits. Tomorrow would be our final day on the trail. The light at the end of the tunnel was beginning to come into focus.
The best singletrack of the trip...
At midnight I was awakened by a couple of big fat raindrops. As the rain began to fall in earnest, we scrambled to string up our two tarps and find a dry space in which to get a few more hours of sleep. As the rain poured from the sky for the next several hours, our sleeping bags became soggier and soggier. Shortly before 6 AM the rain faded to intermittent drops and the team began to rally for an early morning start to the day. As light emerged from the darkness, gone were yesterday’s views of rocky buttes and summits to be replaced by storm-threatening clouds with many hues of grey and blue. It was going to be a wet day of riding…a character-building day.
Packing up in the rain and preparing for a “character-building” day...
Immediately after departing camp we began a long climb up to the inner canyons of the Gila. The hanging low clouds and cool weather were in stark contrast to our previous riding days of eternal blue skies and energy-sucking heat. The desert landscape was vibrant and alive with color. The riding was amazing as our trail snaked ever upward towards a lofty horizon. As we climbed rain showers would come and go and hence, rain jackets would go on and off. With such big country it became a game to anticipate when the approaching rain shower would douse us causing us to reach for an already soaked rain jacket.

Lunch came early, as after several hours of climbing in such soggy conditions we were all ready for a much-needed break. We timed the stop well as the rain abated for a bit and we were treated to more stunning views. Before long though, it was time to continue upward as resting was not getting us any closer to our much-anticipated finish.
Though soaked, our spirits were high at lunch...
Crack! I nervously flinched as lightning and thunder began to add to the foray of the weather we were experiencing. As morning transitioned into afternoon our weather became more severe. At one point, with marbles of ice unabashedly pelting us and causing welts on any exposed skin, Josh looked back at me and simply said, “This is character building.” I laughed and replied, “Yep, this is what this entire experience has been about…building character.” From dragging themselves out of bed for early morning workouts, ripping yet another seam to fix a sewing mistake on a frame bag, pulling cactus spines from skin and clothing, pushing a heavy bike through an unrideable section of trail, enduring all of the unknowns the trail presented, pushing through the leg-searing pain of seemingly never-ending climbs, the feelings of exhaustion yet the mental fortitude to push on, the ability to deal with the unexpected and not let it be demoralizing, to riding in a torrent of rain and ice with quickly deteriorating trail conditions—this is what this experience had been about.
Riding in the rain...
It never rains in the desert...
As we rode our final slippery miles to our end point in a torrential downpour, I took a few moments to reflect on the past couple of months. I am so proud of these students—Beau, Courtney, Devin, Sam, Jared, Josh, and Katelyn. You each committed to attempting to do something seemingly impossible in your own minds. You each believed in the process to making the impossible a reality. You each sacrificed your own aspirations to work together and achieve something as a team—not as single individuals. You each persevered through all of the challenges presented to you. You did it! Congratulations!
After a group hug at the Picketpost TH, a soggy Team AZ walks the final few steps to our waiting van...
Note: Team AZ rode a total of 213.5 unsupported miles over the course of six days. Wahoo!
-------------
All of us at Salsa thank Team AZ for letting us share their story. But more importantly, we congratulate them on their effort on this trip. It is wonderful to see students choosing a less common path. -Kid.

Absolutely fantastic, congratulations!
David | April 8th, 2013
Fantastic work team!
Curious to hear your reflections (now that the trip is done) on gear & equipment choices. What worked? What didn’t? What could you have lived without? And what do you wish you’d brought along for the ride?
Jim Davis | April 24th, 2013
Great trip made possible by a great leader. Way to go Brett and Team AZ.

The Paulding History House was the home of Arroyo Grande’s first resident medical doctor, Dr. Ed Paulding. He came to Arroyo Grande in 1882 and married Clara Edwards; together they bought the house in 1891. A grand old oak tree believed to be 250 years old still dominates the front yard today. Dr. Paulding, also a talented wood worker spent many hours working on carvings which can be seen in the house along with countless other artifacts, among them the only authentic Chumash Indian basket in the County.
The Pauldings had a daughter, Ruth, in 1892, who became a schoolteacher in Arroyo Grande for many years. The Paulding Middle School across the street from the house is named for her. Ruth passed away at in 1985 in the same house. She generously left the house and its contents to the San Luis Obispo Historical Society and in 1998 the property was passed on to the South County Historical Society.
The house is open and free to tour the first Saturday of most months, call (805) 489-8282 for dates and hours. It is located at 551 Crown Hill Road in Arroyo Grande.

The most essential aspect to consider when choosing the new countertop of yours is definitely the price. On top of the cost of the supplies, you have to give some thought to the expense of installation of the material you pick out for your kitchen countertops. Custom glass countertops can give a kitchen a great contemporary look. Among the newest countertop supplies to be introduced to the kitchen style market are the cup countertops.

Professional kitchens have a tendency to choose stainless steel countertops as these're hard wearing and easy to maintain, nonetheless, they're a lot more costly than granite, and they are not quite pleasing to look at, so they're unlikely to boost the homely feel to your kitchen. For individuals who actually do not want the brief lifespans of laminate or Formica kitchen countertops and are not restricted by small budgets.

Sandoval was suspended for the rest of this season, despite a lot of protest and pleading from parents and his players. Many of the parents claim Sandoval is being treated harsher than other coaches in similar situations. At a hearing on June 8, arranged by the Parks & Recreation Department, that suspension was upheld and extended until next May, according to Sandoval.
Sandoval asked for the council’s help in getting documents from that hearing before his day in court. That’s right, a dispute with a baseball umpire has become a criminal matter. Sandoval got a letter on Monday, June 22 ordering him to appear in Burbank Superior Court on July 2, 2009 to answer to a misdemeanor charge of battery, Section 242 of the Penal Code.
The city council members and City Attorney Dennis Barlow said they were unaware that Sandoval was being prosecuted for his involvement in that altercation. Still, the beleaguered coach was assured he would receive the documents he requested by tomorrow.
Also, speaking during public comments, long time Burbank resident Mike Nolan, who demanded to know, “how much money,” is being spent on lawyers and investigations and “how many claims” are there against the city. Nolan has asked these questions before. However this time, after some discussion about “preserving the integrity” of the investigations, the council and city attorney grudgingly agreed to provide Nolan with some information.
Later in the meeting, the council voted 4-to-1 to include an addendum to the police commission application. That addendum would include three items requiring applicants to reveal if they have been convicted of a felony, a crime of moral turpitude or have been on probation. Councilman Gordon, who voted against the addendum, pointed out the police commission application never asked these sort of questions before and, “… I don’t think the city has suffered for it.”
Council Member Anja Reinke argued the addendum would help “… protect the city.” When Gordon suggested the answers to the questions by the candidates could taint “…their reputations.” Reinke led the charge to have the addendum classified as confidential, something the city attorney said he would have to check to see if they could do legally.
Gordon opposed the confidentially, saying it sends the wrong message when the council should be about providing transparency, especially in light of the council’s controversial removal of John Brady from the police commission. Council Member/Mayor Gary Bric countered by saying he has received, “…very positive feedback” to the way the council ousted Brady from the police commission. Applicants are now being sought for consideration to fill that vacant seat. It will be interesting to see who steps forward and volunteers to go through this dubious process.
Confidential questions for confidential purposes. Again they have learned nothing.
On the coach, it really looks to me like something more is going on than any of them are saying. Could there be even more confidential documents waiting to be found in the park department ? Something tells me there are.
Mayor Bric obviously doesn’t read this blog if he received “positive feedback” on how they handled Brady. Feedback from who…the Chief of Police?
The rest is as usual. A lot of questions and no answers!
The vice mayor slipped last night and let it out who is on this Youth Task Force Board. SURPRISE! It’s the same groups that have their hands out for money. She didn’t say when or where they meet and she didn’t say how they got on that board.
Sure after a few drinks at the Mayors bar the chief couldn’t say enough about his happiness with the councils vote.
If Reinke is still serving on an organization board for which she votes city funds, it’s a legal conflict of interest for her, and the complete council decision can be vacated. Because of this possibility I doubt she serves in any official capacity any more with the Family Service Agency. But who knows…?
Interesting thing about that group– a dozen years ago the news came out that they refused to provide abortion or birth control counseling to their clients, and would not refer anyone to Planned Parenthood. It created quite a stir with Ted McConkey and others on the council back when they were asked to approve funds.
Here’s some more on the Sandoval situation. We apparently have some loose cannons in our city government:
This whole coach deal with Sandoval is outrageous! The Parks and Rec Dept., just don’t like him and want him out. They will do anything and back up anyone to do this. We understand a few games suspension but to make it go all the way to next season until May!! What reason is that for, so he does not come back or he won’t have his teams together! So bad, so bad, so bad. This is not the end of the fight. Jose Sandoval is the nicest person ever! People cannot judge how a person looks on the outside. Sooner or later the truth will come out about the Umpire who started all this. The Umpire is lying about him pushing him. The umpire followed him to the dugout and when Coach Sandoval turned around the umpire was in his face and they bumped each other!! The umpire knows this and his second umpire that was at the game did not even see anything but told him that he would put whatever he says happened on his report!! Unbelievable. I hope someone is able to get this all straightened out!!
Sandoval Dodger Fan you’re going to find things don’t get straightened out in Burbank. What happens in Burbank is people are friends with each other or related to each other and they lie to cover for each other. Unless lots of people get mad and really let them all have it what they will just do is stick together and tell whatever lie it takes to protect each other. It doesn’t seem right what they did to Coach Sandoval to me but what else is new in Burbank. Maybe Coach Sandoval can coach someplace else and the kids could all go with him.
Does anybody know when the fight with Coach Sandoval was suppose to have happened and where it happened ?
I don’t know this coach Sandoval but I do know Burbank. It looks to me like first they wanted him gone because someone else wants those teams or they want those teams gone so some other kids can win. The whole thing with that appeal set of a date months too late gave me that view.
The guy came last week asking for the papers from his appeal. So they said they would get them to them and isntead they send him something about charging him with a crime
So the guy comes back this week and the city attorney pretends he didn’t do anything until the guy pulls out the paper he sent the guy. This would be funny if it wasn’t all so messed up.
So did the guy get the papers from the appeal ? NO what he got was charged with some crime but no papers they promised him.
Sorry but it’s so messed up it tells me the guy is innocent and that park and rec department is up to something. I hope it’s not the kids they want to get rid of and he is just the way to do it. Maybe they want to use it for people with more money. That wouldn’t surprise me at all.
The guy needs to demand a jury and let the jury see all the things they did and all the times he begged for some justice. I think most juries will convict park and rec and let the guy go. He just needs to file a suit against the parks and rec department.
If Sandoval had said nothing to the council and had not appealed the initial ruling, he would only have suffered an end-of-the-year suspension.
Instead, he complains to the council, seeks a city appeal, and then– according to news reports– he suffers an ADDITIONAL penalty of a following year suspension as well!
Talk about retaliation. There’s also the interesting legal question of whether the second appeal body has the right to levy an added un-noticed punishment in response to Sandoval’s merely taking advantage of his appeal rights.
Legally, a governmental body must lay out all of the charges, evidence and possible penalties ahead of time, before any hearings, so that the defendant has the ability to know what he or she is facing. That’s just basic due process. And they cannot sanction any individual with additional penalities merely for making use of their appeal rights.
But it doesn’t stop there. After Sandoval goes to the council a second time and complains about the adverse action hearing results, he is then told that he is now going to be facing CRIMINAL charges for the allegation– months after the original event.
This is all clear reprisal– and if Sandoval levied any charges of possible ethnic discrimination against the city, to either its agents or the hearing officer, then the case can easily be made (and won) that it was agency reprisal for a complaint of discrimination.
It’s bad enough that the city let this thing go this far. But to now misuse the police department to punish an individual who took advantage of his due process rights is gross malfeasance, as well as a criminal act in itself.
It’s truly time for the county D.A to step in. We’ve all had enough of this rank abuse of power. It’s a clear attempt on the part of Barlow and the city to intimidate people into staying quiet.
A little background on Jose Sandoval.
Jose has had a rough past. This is true. It is imperative that it be known that this is his past.
He has volunteered his time and is coaching 5 teams. Where can you find someone willing to devote that kind of time? Most of the kids he has on his teams are children from low income and/or parents who work full time and are not able to make it to practices. Jose have devoted his time and energy and giving these kids something to do other than hang around in the streets. Doesn’t that account for anything? Isn’t that what Parks and Rec is all about? Certainly, they can all go to another organization outside the city. But why? This is their city!! Why should they be driven out like outcasts. Do they not fit the profile of the average “Burbankian”. This is about the kids they just want to play ball!
Burbank politians are a tight knit group of individuals and for a person like Sandoval who doesn’t have the means to pay for an attorney strong enough to go against the city, it’s tough! The city is fully aware of this. They continue to pursue this frivolous law suit because they know he is not going to be able diligently defend himself. The witness letters and letters of support were thrown out because they did not match what their Umpire (employee) stated. There is no way Jose can win this case unless it is dropped. The only way for that to happen is by pressure from the City Council. They appointed this Federation and they can influence them. At the last City Council meeting “our council members” one by one gracefully washed their hands of it.
I guess these kids are so unimportant that “our city” is willing to take the chance and let these kids go a year without a coach. How many will we loose to the streets? Who is being punished Jose Sandoval or the kids on 5 teams?
Jose made a mistake, he questioned the actions of a bunch of self very important politians. The very act of seeking justice was an attack on the on their absolute authority. This will not be tolerated in the kingdom of Burbank. My advice would be to seek forgiveness or a public beating may be the next step.
The city knows most people don’t have the ability to just hire an attorney to challenge what they do and they take advantage of that.
If the person does hire an attorney the City will hire a few extra attorneys and try to out money the person and drag it on so the person runs out of money.
Some council members don’t care who get’s hurt by what they do. For them it’s about being important, picking who and what they like and forcing the rest of us to both pay for it and suffer from it. In the end there is no justice in Burbank whether your a coach or a cat named kitty pants your fate is based on who likes you and who does not.
i am shockedat what is happening to this coach are we not passed discrimination and racism already it seems this man is not being judged by his action but by his race and skin color i cant believe we the people are just standing here and watching this man get lynched right in front of us and no will speak on his behalf what this man has done and is doing for this community is great he has kept all these what is it 80 kids in and around possitive activities i wish we spent half the time he does on those poor kids but when it comes to it i am real busy i know that ends up being all of our excuses we speak out but when we are counted on it we are busy that day or that moment i mr sandoval am truly sorry for what my community is putting you and the kids through if only we can all stand together as a community and get jsutice for this man dont just blog or write stand up if you can and say we have had enough here now do something. mr sandoval i will try and be at your hearing next thursday and show my support and please continue what your doing i see the good you are trying to do for those kids “let he who has not sinned cast the first stone”
Come on people! Do you think the City cares about a coach? People have had thier civil rights violated and nobody, except Gordon cares.
Its bad when the police are all saying its bad. This coach is a small example of “protect the city” mentality that the current council uses as a measure of justice.
There are scandals everywhere, in the police, fire, city attorney, organized sports, etc… People need to write letters to a congressman or someone outside the city. It is the only way to get change!
It’s worst then just scandals everyplace and Coach Sandoval is anything but the biggest criminal in Burbank. They just like to go after the little people and if the little people are minority members thats even better for them. Burbank arrests all the wrong people they did that for a long time.
I care about peoples CIVIL RIGHTS getting trashed all the time. I did write to the congressman one time and you know what ? He didn’t even answer me back. I don’t think he cares about people just like they don’t. I didn’t vote for the bad people but somebody did and the congressman was maybe one of them that did.
Here’s some more on the Burbank Parks and Recreation. It looks like they want to get rid of the nasty roller hockey players along with Coach Sandoval. They are making room for something, maybe an exclusive chess club? Watch them on YouTube
Everyone,
I share your concerns for Coach Jose Sandoval’s situation and what that says about Burbank and its politics.
City officials have to be aware that having all of these things come to light at the same time, the police lawsuit, the cat caper, the police commission controversy, and now Coach Sandoval’s case —creates all sorts of suspicions in the community.
Someone asked when and where did Jose have the altercation with the umpire. It was at McCambridge Park field #2, on North Glenoaks Boulevard in Burbank, on May 18, 2009.
You are so correct there are so many people saying what has happened to them it’s impossible to think that they are just liars.
Personally I feel that the Park Department has had very serious issues for a long time, now I am starting to wonder what hasn’t had serious problems for a while.
We should be taking better care of people and working much harder to establish fairness in everything. It troubles me when everything seems to indicate our leaders just don’t care.
all of you need to back off already the verdic is in was was in the minute coach sandoval walked into council for the first time he is guilty i dont know why he is still trying to styr things up. just do your sentence andgo on with your life im sure the kids will be fine without you as you and many others have and will be replaced. their are coaches out there that will take on your 5 teams or 80 kids. so what do you have to prove now that you care for the kids we know hooorahh! we know now set them free and go on with your life. no one cares about one individual we have bigger issues to put our time into. face the truth coachyour not wanted here anymore you seem to of overstayed your welcome and now you face this. if you really want to coach then do what other bloggers are saying and coach elsewhere.yes we know you have been doing this for 16 years and you have 80 kids,wheres your support from them all we ever see is two or three parents im sure you have some kids that their parents work for the city and i bet they are not their for you right well they chose their jobs before they choose you and i understand i would do the same if i was in their shoes. understand this you can and will be replaced but their jobs wont so for their sakes and the kids just quit or surrender the fight is over you have lost just go elsewhere and leave our city the way it is and has been
Bob I think you are onto something. So long as people are quiet and smile at the autority figures in Burbank everything is A-ok but if they dare to question or even worse complain look out.
Take Brady as an example. Brady was their pet but hey he dared to question what’s up with racism and civil rights and BAM public lynching of Brady.
The Roaches were cute so long as they didn’t push for their cat back. Push and the city just might need to admit another mistake. Good bye Roaches.
Coach Sandoval, great to have him coaching the kids so long as he did what he was told. Stand up about what’s going on and BAM another public lynching.
Anybody else see a sinister pattern behind these people yet ?
For those who didn’t see it here is the exchange regading Coach Sandoval and the City Attonrney’s denial that he ad any information about the city prosecuting him. Real convinining there city attorney.
jjones,
So I guess we know what you are all about. Giving up!! You right, why don’t we all lay down and get screwed. Let’s just give up on life. We should all just take things and never excercise our rights. According to jjones we don’t have rights! Bigger issues! Its just 80 kids. Leave them to the streets thats what we should do.
I watched the video on Youtube. So Coach Sandoval has to stand up and pass them their own letter ? Gheesh they really know what they are doing if someone has to pass them their own letter so they know what they did.
Who the hell is running this place anyway ?
This thing with the coach doesn’t smell right. Why would it take them so long to file some charges and who filed them. I don’t believe for a minute what that attorney said. In front of the cameras they might pretend to have nothing to do with this but I bet behind the scenes the likes of that Vice Mayor and some of the council people tell the attorney exactly what they want him to do.
Some city officials don’t know how to take any criticism. Watch council meetings and watch how they resent the fact they are required to listen to the people. Some of them would put an end to that if they could and we should not re-elect those people.
dont worry coach most of us here support you and cant imagine what you are going though please hang on we the people will stand up for you if needed i know we all can find it in our hearts and busy schedules to help a falling friend if its alright we call you a friend after all that you do for our community its actually the least we can do and thank you
Jose Sandoval is the victim of a modern day lynching. Myself and at least 100 other supporters asked the city council to just do their job and make sure that the Parks and Recreation Board had all the facts before they made this dreadful decision. The city is wasteing tax payer money to go after a coach, when nobody is asking why this umpire is still being an umptire. What was needed here, at most, was mediation. Instead, the umpire knew somebody, and then somebody else knew somebody. So much so that the first night we spoke as a group, a representative under Mike Flad, City Manager, got up and read a letter that the umpire was going to file charges against the coach. WTH!!!! how do you publicy announce criminal charges at a city council meeting–unless you intent is to slander. Jose has a wife and family. What he once was is not what he is today, but since Burbank perpetuates nepotism in the worst way, I am sure the umpire is related to somebody, who is related to somebody . . .
I call out to the people of Burbank to cast your next vote against any and all city elected officials who will not stand up and call this blatant act of discrimination and unprejudice and cowardness.
The children and their families deserved better representation than misleading and abuse of power.,
Take a look at this clip from the council meeting on May 19 and think about what is being asked/said about the Burbank Police Commission and then think about the secrecy with Brady and Sandoval.
Hey Jjones . . .who ever you are–in deed a male, and probably the umpire if I have analyzed your hatred that is within your email . . “go back to where you came from”. . . you sound a little pissed. NO!!!We are not going away. Come out and fight like a real man . . .we have all seen Jose, but where is the the UMPIRE. Come out, come out whereever you are . . .

You are spot on about not re-electing Anja Reinke or David Golosnki. Both of them are arrogant and so full of themselves they treat our city as their own private business. I have had enough of them.

ANSWER:
I wonder what would happen right about now if a vote of confidence were taken in the City Council and City Attorney ?
just a moment to say Rest in Peace to Michael jackson. The music will live on forever.
Everyone,
Good discussion. It will be interesting to see what happens with Coach Sandoval’s court case.
Arman,
Thanks for the kind thoughts about Michael Jackson and the video link. Also, check out my post, “King of Pop Michael Jackson dies at 50.”
Coach Sandoval got screwed by the system. He is a good coach and that’s not what parks and recreation wants. Those people want their chosen teams to win at all costs and that is what this is all about.
Hello and i just want to thank all of you for lending me your ears on what is happening to me i honestly wanted to just give up and let the city win another one but theirs too much at stake here and thats the children to me its always been about the children. their is too much negativity going on in this world that i just want to take them all away from that for a few hours a day and concentrate on a possitive event which is baseball these kids are always willinbg to be at practices up to an hour before they are suppose to be their they press on their parents that they dont want to miss practice or be late thats the respect they give me and return it by standing up for them and fighting this is by far the toughest fight i have been involved in and i know the city always wins but until the kids tell me to stop fighting for them i wont stop mr./mrs. jjones i even thank you for your remarks everyone has the freedom of speech and everyone has their own opinion but i am not ready to pack up and run yes thats what you call what you want me to do is pack up and run im a big man with bad knees i dont run because i run real slow you will catch me. once again i want to thank you all and i want to let you know i will fight for the kids and i will fight for everyone so this doesnt happen to anyone ever again
Yo Coach
Burbank ain’t fair they beat and abuse minorities but yo they smile and have fun doing it. Stand up and fight the bitches cuz the Park and Rec people do this stuff on purpose. If you weren’t brown coach none of this stuff would be happening and the kids they get treated bad everyday in Burbank schools you know it and we all know it. Go coach te respeto.
A few corrections as I am someone who has played in our city’s sports leagues for a long time. The Burbank Athletic Federation is not appointed by the City Council it is appointed by the park and rec director. If someone doesn’t like the ruling of the BAF then they can appeal it to the park and rec director. That’s what mike flad said two tuesdays ago. I think but, IM NOT SURE, that there is a Park and Rec. Board. You can take it to them I’m almost positive that was stated in our coaches meeting.
Frannie Q.,
It is my understanding that the Burbank Athletic Federation is set up by the Parks and Recreation Department.
A lot of citizens bring their problems to the city council when they are having difficult getting what they believe is fair treatment from other city agencies or departments.
In Coach Sandoval’s situation, the city council got him an earlier hearing date than had been previously scheduled. Also, the city council got involved when the coach was having difficult getting minutes and other documents from that hearing.
Frannie Q If the Burbank Athletic Federation is appointed by the park and rec director then its probably the park and rec directors friends and cousins in the Burbank Athletic Federation so what good could it do to appeal it to that person ? Couldn’t that be like appealing the behavior of the worst kid on the team to his little league mom ?
The “Good Ol’ Boys Club” that is under scrutiny in the Burbank Police Department extends much further than just the BPD. It trickles down to all of the long-time City Employees within the City’s wide-spread departments and programs.
As the daughter of a Burbank Police Officer, I was brought up in a household where my father would not tolerate any form of contact with Jose and his family. We were brought up to believe that the Sandoval family was bad and unworthy of being Burbank citizens.
After my father left our household, I began to play co-ed slowpitch softball for the Burbank Parks and Rec. league. This is where I met Jose for the first time. He played for one of the teams that my team played against. Within a year I was playing for his co-ed team as well as a woman’s fastpitch and slowpitch team that he got together for myself, my friends and fellow teammates from our co-ed team.
Jose is one of the most self-less people that I have ever met. By coaching all of his young teams he creates a fun and safe outlet for the children of the community. It is a place where the children learn great life lessons in responsibility, good sportsmanship, dedication, teamwork and leadership skills. The Sandoval Dodger’s keep 80+ young kids off of the streets of Burbank, preventing them from find less constructive means of entertainment throughout the city. In my opinion, I thnik that the BPD should be extending a hand in gratitude to Jose for these efforts.
I played softball for the Burbank Parks and Rec. Department for 16 years of my life. It is a department that many people have watched deteriorate over the years. Much like the rest of the depratments and programs within the City.
It is unfortunate that Jose is still being discriminated against for his rough past as a teenager. He has done more good for this community than many of it’s own officials.
I am so glad that I was able to think for myself and allow Jose and his entire family into my life. I am honored to say that he is my friend and an extended family member.
It’s pretty amusing the D.A. gets to spend the City’s tax dollars on cases that he doesn’t even know are crossing his desk. I’m so fortunate to not be living in Burbank anymore. It looks like I got out just in time!
frannie Q. the baf is set up by the parks and recs exactly so do you think you have a chance with them no! its just a way for the parks and recs to clean their hands of and say they had nothing to do with that decision if you were in the baf would you disagree with 6 other members and take the heat from parks and recs no! you would be cut from the BAF. besides the BAF is established of umpires x coaches that say they have never lost their tempers or argued a call now if you believe that then you have never coached every coach that spends time out their with the kids get emotionally involved so when they get a bad call they will argue and complain. coaches are humans too and they have a right to argue if needed but dont go too far also it is said that coaches have got to know all of the rules for whatever division they are coaching but for some reason these new umpires are not properly trained you all need to go to some games next season and watch how umpires walk as if they are kings and if you dont kiss their butts look out im sure not all umpires are bad but the majority do this as a job and dont care about the sport itself and thats a shame you need people that understand and appreciate the game they are umpiring or refereeing.
This Burbank Athletic Federation sounds like a good ol boys club. Whats the racial and ethnic mix on that thing ?
Reposnding to the comment above I would say you are right. Remember Brady. Pose a question they don’t want asked and they pull out every weapon they have to smear you and remove you. Who wants to tell me they won’t do the same to any BAF member that dares to disagree from their parties line ?
A small elite group has destroyed all that’s good in Burbank and taken the public hostage.
Think about it like this. If the cops get harrased what you thinking happens to a coach or even some kid at some park ? Maybe this coach was teaching them kids morals and the ring leaders in the parks said we can’t have no morals we just want the brainwashing and the control so get lost coach you bad for business as usual.
I’m sure that someone will ask me if I ever went to a park board meeting or something to ask them, but here go some questions anyway.
If the umpires are paid and it is just a job to them just how are they supervised and by whom ?
Who pays the umpires and refs ?
In a way this is an important question because if the comment that it is just a job to these officials that could mean they do whatever they are told to keep their job. Who it is that gives them orders becomes the question and what orders are they given. Next is what is the oversight over them and the one who writes their check.
Why won’t I be surprised if the answer is they are paid by the city, trained by the city and beholding to the city. Next if they do something wrong you get to go to this baf which is hand picked by the city and answers to the city. If that is how it all works it sounds like a really stacked deck to me.
What a wackadoo system. Kids who want to play go on a list and if no team picks them their parents need to report to the office. Hand picked players on hand picked teams is how this looks.. source link below
the umpires are trained by the city and they are unfortunately paid by the coache s or teams they are officiating and its tax free money that is why most of these umpires do it for the xtra money coaches and parents have made complaints on umpires but those letters somehow disappear and you never see them. umpires are given too much power tolie on their reports and say what ever it takes to get rid of someone weather it is true or not as you see with that coach. that list you mentioned is true because i heard this coach takes kids that have never played or that no one else wants from this list and turns them into champions how is that wrong. how do you think he has 5 teams i cant even coach 1 team now thats a hero if i ever saw one. he deserves to be awarded not punished and humiliated. i walk around the parks and hear people mentining this very situation, and i heard the field supervisor that was at that game the incident occured is also an umpire so you think he is going to say something different than the umpires story. i wouldnt doubt they copied the same story now is that justice and for who. people really if your fed up we need to support this coach he cant do it on his own and they know it your voices are heard in numbers dont just blog like someone already said join together and help this man as if it was your brother or sister look at mals comment her dad was a burbank cop and it seems they didnt like this coach much before now do you think these two organizations are joining forces to get rid of him and possibly put him in jail for a while to me it looks like its headed in that direction what do you think their is an article on THE BURBANK TIMES about this mans life story you connect the dots
I have witnessed Coach Sandoval coach his teams many times. This coash is amazing and is gifted with great coaching abilities! My son played against his team a few times. We always lost. I wanted my son to play on coach Sandoval’s team—Some special technique this coach has with kids. My son learn and played the best he had ever before. I will be the first to admit, Coach Sandoval is one of the few best coaches out there. Has anyone ever looked into his winning records? That’s a major reflection on his coaching abilities with the kids. It’s a shame this is happening.
As for the confrontation, burbank empires…..let’s pull their complaint records and face the fact that they too, make mistakes everyday on calls and inappropriate behaviors.
I will stand by Coach Sandoval’s side. We Shouldn’t lose him.
Peace to all!
A little info. I am a parent of an 8 year old girl. She plays pitch-tee and loves it. I play womens fast-pitch and love it, my husband plays men’s fastpitch and loves it…What we do not love are some of the umpires that are out there. On my husbands team there was recently a differnce of opinion on a call during a game, the umpire was not too pleased with this, so he made a very derogetory comment aimed directly at a persons handicap, this person the team manager who I might add is a very well known and respected person in the softball community, along with just about every other person present at the game heard the comment, exept who you may ask??????The second umpire…This is just an example of the way things work out on the fields….As a player I have been witness to the way some of these umpires operate….One umpire makes a call and that call is appealed the umpires meet and in the meeting of the two and usually the catcher right in the middle of it, I am a catcher…..the play is not verbally reviewed instead, the one umpire says to the other…..I’ll go with whatever you say….If they do this in a game, which we as the players and coaches, pay them to officiate, what makes anyone think that they wont do it elsewhere…Coach Sandoval, keep your head high and keep on fighting, truth always prevails, it may not come for a long time but it will eventually, if the fight is seen all the way through….Come on people if we don’t stand up for this now what else will they take from us….I know to some it may seem like something small, after all it’s just a coach, in some little leauge team, but it represents way more than just that,,,,It represents the unity and the will to fight for what’s right in our community……Perhaps it’s not letters that are needed anymore to show our support, perhaps it’s a demostration, that we as citizens of burbank will no longer stand for this type of unjust treatment…..
Can anyone explain what exactly happened at this game – what is Coach Sandoval accused of doing to this umpire?
A criminal charge of battery I believe means he is accused of hitting the umpire – is that what happened?
More information I think is needed – for me anyway – to get a picture of what should happen.
No coach Sandoval did not hit the umpire…..This is the alligation made only after Coach Sandoval decided to appeal his suspension from coaching…..If the umpire would have been hit the BPD would have been at the field within minutes…..parents, park officials, and fellow umpire would have called the offense in….This is just a way to try and bully someone to not go against anything that burbank city officials say…..
Here’s a question: do Coach Sandoval’s teams win a lot of games?
That might be an explanation for at least one reason why he’s being harassed.
Any small town that takes its sports teams as seriously as Burbank does these days is going to go ballistic when they don’t always get their way. From much of the current talk in the council chambers about “our youth” and our “wonderful sports activities,” it’s pretty obvious that there is an element in town that invests a lot of emotional and psychological baggage into the mix.
Combine that with a Latino guy making waves, and it’s no surprise that their reaction will be hamfisted and ugly. So just consider the caliber of the people involved– this is not the old Burbank any more.
While you are all at it pull the prosecution records of the City Attorney I don’t believe they normally prosecute assault cases. So why wasn;t this case referd to the district attorney, or was it and it got rejected so the City Attorney decided to do the job all on his own ? It doesn’t add up the date of incident, date of charges and everything inbetween mixed with the city attorney as the posecutor ? An assault is normally a Distric Attorney prosecution not one done by the city attorney.
If what you are saying is true Krey then they are making a story up as they go along. That is a horrible thing for officials to do. Has the Park Board stepped in to look at this mess yet ?
Krey,
I agree that a demonstration is in order with some media coverage. You have to remember that this is a little league coach. There are so many major scandals right now, involving police officers are going to jail. Why would the Burbank City officials care about one Hispanic Coach.
They don’t care because he is going to sue the city and they will do everything to discredit him.
Just like “Kitty Pants” Just like police discrimination and corruption. Just like the Fire Chief defrauding the city. Just like the girl who was beat by a Captain and covered up. Just like the immigrant who was beat and covered up. Just like the sexual harassment at the animal shelter. Just like John Brady!
Nothing will change because everyone forgets! Wait till the next scandal…it will be coach Sandoval…who???
I never played baseball but I sure know the valley sk8 rink blows chunks and the way they run it sucks. They charge you for nothing at that place. Why don’t they charge people to sit on teh grass and kick soccer balls all around ? No they just charge sk8rs they suck.
Carma you are correct they don’t care about all the corruption, they are the corruption and maybe a protest could become a kick off to recalling the 4 of them. Replace them with people who give a dam.
sk8sk8sk8 i have seen this park your talking about on valley right. yes i too think it is wrong to charge the youth for using this facility what is it with this city the youth cant do something they like or love without problems i use to work in orange county and my co worker took me by his old high school in huntington beach they have a small caliber sk8 park on the high school campus actually in front of the school now that is cool. why do you kids have to go to vacant lots to enjoy your activities i have also seen some of you guys sk8ing through olive park and a cop car behind you guys puling you over and giveing you a ticket for sk8ing in the park. i thought the parks were for the kids your first step has been taken by you writting on this website. we all need to say to our council and say what about our kids. enough is enough this isnt that little town from the movie footloose where you cant do anything they dont want you to do. but if you let them now just wait and see what else they wil try and get away with so yes everyone tell a friend and lets do it together and support this coach and the youth programs and lets demand changes. start from the top we need new council members and we need them now.
Everyone,
Rightly or wrongly, the Coach Sandoval situation has come to represent the perception that there are shady dealings going in Burbank.
It may be a small issue compared to the lawsuits, investigations, and allegations of misconduct swirling around the city right now. Still, I think city officials should reconsider their handling of Sandoval’s case and clear up the matter before it becomes a big legal mess.
Also, check out the mailbag on The Burbank Leader website. There are three letters/opinions about the police commission brouhaha
The letter about Mayor Bric is so inspiring. Mr Brady just got probation ? I think Mr Brady got probation for driving drunk. The mayor also drove drunk. The difference between them is the mayor still denies he ever had a drinking problem while Mr Brady admited the problem and got help. What a city where we punish the person who gets help and reward the one in denial by making him mayor.
Sure we have a mayor with a DUI but we also have people being abused all over town welcome to Oz.
They charge the kids to use the park programs ?
Councilman Talamantes was expressing his concern about obesity in youth and pushed for money for obesity programs. Maybe he should push for the money to make park activities free for our youth. Programs don’t stop obesity, exercise does. Who else remembers President Kennedy and his emphasis on youth exercise and fitness ?
It seems we spend so much money on programs and neglect the simple solutions that are proven to work.
Add my voice as an objection to charging for park programs.
Everyone,
Warning! Comments on this blog have to be professional and civil.
From reading comments here someone please let me know if I have this correct. For a kid to play baseball he/she needs a team that will take him or her. If no team takes him or her someone needs to volunteer as a coach to coach him or her on a team ? The coach is a volonteer and the kid has to pay and then the umpires get paid ? Let me know if I understand how this system works or not.
Concerned parent this is that small minded town from footloose complete with it’s share of bad cops to enforce the dress code, speaking code and you got next the officials will restrict dancing in public.
In honor of Michael Jackson and summing up Burbank more or less.
Jim Carlile,
Dropped by your blog Semichorus over the weekend, very interesting reading. Especially the post, “Does Gary Bric have a ‘moral turpitude’ crime in his past?”
Everyone,
I hear there have been problems posting comments on my blog. Sorry about that. We’ve had a few glitches, but I’m hoping they will be fixed soon.
So thanks for your patience. And please check back later and try to leave a comment.
Feel free to e-mail me through link at the top of the page about any technical problems.
Hi, It’s always difficult to stomach our friends who are in trouble. We watched coach Sandoval at the City Council meeting do a good job of showing where his heart is. The Sandoval group does a great job of bringing kids and families together for baseball events and teaching kids how to play baseball well. We have always been impressed by the Civitan day participation and barbeque. Competing is something most of us do, whethere we are playing ball, umpiring, driving a car, dressing up…most everything can become competitive. So let’s keep the main thing the main thing. This blog can go a long way in supporting Coach Sandoval if we stay focused on the many strengths that coach has shown over the years…many years that far outweigh the intensity of a game situation, the pressure on the umpires to make many difficult calls, and who knows what. We can all be moody, have a bad day, etc. Let’s not call names or put down other organizations. Let’s try to build up support for Coach Sandoval and put together a blog of letters of situations we know about. LEt’s not get distracted from that. We’ve played several of the Sandoval teams over the years. Their participation, and Coach Sandoval’s participation is something that will keep Burbank sports healthy. Happy 4th.
Jose, you are in my thoughts and prayers every day. You are in contact with my daughter and she keeps me informed of your situation. I know these charges are taking a toll on you and I know that the process you have to go through is so time consuming. It is a good idea that someone had to schedule a community gathering in your support, mainly so you would see how highly so many people in this community think of you. I doubt that it will have any influence on your court appearance but you will surely know that a whole lot of people are standing with you and care about you! You and your entire family are wonderful, responsible and caring people. There is no question in my mind that you have more integrety than so many of the people employeed by our city. My daughter and I think of you as a special family member and a true friend. I just want you to know that we admire your fight with the city and agree that the charges are completely out of line in relation to the incident. Always feel good about standing up for yourself as this is another lesson you are teaching your own children as well as the children on your teams. I read the comment above stating that this should have been resolved by mediation could not be more true. Have a big support party in one of the parks, I will be there!
Fine blog. I got a lot of effective data. I’ve been following this technology for awhile. It’s fascinating how it keeps changing, yet some of the core factors remain the same. Have you seen much change since Google made their most recent acquisition in the area?
Keep on keeping on. This post is proof of why I keep coming back to your site.Melt butter; add onion, celery, and green pepper, and cook, about 5 minutes, occasionally stirring. Add tomato sauce, chili powder, sweet basil, and oregano. Place a tortilla in bottom of buttered casserole; add a thin layer of turkey and cheese, then sauce. Repeat for all. Bake 20 to 30 minutes or until hot.BRIDGEWATER, N.J.—The United States could save more than a billion dollars over five years if 15 percent of all dialysis patients used peritoneal dialysis, according to a study in the April issue of Clinical Therapeutics.
Peritoneal dialysis has been reported to be a less expensive treatment than conventional in-center hemodialysis and could save Medicare money if it is used more. However, PD's use has declined steadily, peaking at 15 percent of all dialysis patients in 1993 and falling to 8 percent in 2005.
To understand PD’s financial impact on future Medicare spending, the researchers performed a five-year budget-impact analysis using data from the 2007 U.S. Renal Data System report.
They found that if PD use decreased to 5 percent over the next five years, Medicare spending on end-stage renal disease patients would increase by approximately $401 million, according to the study. However, if the percentage of PD patients increased to 13 percent over the next five years, then Medicare would save nearly $826 million.
Furthermore, savings would increase to around $960 million if PD use increased to 13 percent over the next four years. And if its use increased to 15 percent by the end of five years, Medicare could see savings equaling more than $1.1 billion, according to the study.
PD is less expensive than in-center HD, which is the most-used form of dialysis. In 2005, Medicare spent $69,758 a year on each HD patient and $50,847 a year on each PD patient, according to the USRDS. Part of the savings, according to the study, is due to lower drug spending, less hospitalizations and the fact that PD patients tend to be younger.
“The magnitude of the potential savings alone provides sufficient justification for further research into the factors that may be impeding greater use of PD (or home dialysis in general) in this country,” the authors wrote.Sexy Dresses
