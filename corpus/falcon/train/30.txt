I don’t even know what a crumpet is. Some sort of scone-type thing? Who knows. It sounds like crump, as in crump dancing, which is cool but probably doesn’t go too well with tea. In fact, I don’t think I know anyone who eats crumpets. It’s a British thing — along with the accent, the red double-decker buses and that sport named after an insect.
That’s why I am completely gobsmacked and off my trolley whenever I hear Americans obsess over and adore perhaps the most British thing of all: the royal family. I just want all the headlines, news coverage and fascination to bugger off and be left to those American oppressors — does the Revolutionary War mean anything to you people?
Just look at the media mania surrounding the marriage of Kate and William and the birth of their little royal nugget. Seriously, people in freaking Nebraska stayed up all night to watch that parade of who could wear the goofiest hat — otherwise known as the royal wedding. I’m sorry, but I am already very susceptible to getting bags under my eyes from a lack of sleep. I can’t afford to be off my handsome A-game (A for American) the next day due to a televised wedding of people I have never met.
Whenever I’m waiting in line at the grocery store to pay for my 10 boxes of macaroni and cheese and I see some blown-up headline and picture on the front of a magazine that has to do with some dumb rumor about the royal family, I get the insane urge to grasp the magazine, jump on a table and scream “Don’t give me Kate or give me death” as I rip it page by page. Honestly, who cares what these rich people thousands of miles away are doing?
First off, the royal family legitimately hasn’t done anything to become the royal family. They were suddenly conscious one day and realized they had to never work in their lives and are able to take rides on ponies whenever they want. They’re nothing special. It’s not like they were magically instilled with superhuman qualities while in the womb — although Harry Potter is indeed British, so I guess we can’t completely eliminate this possibility.
Americans obsessing over the British royal family is like Brits obsessing over some American dude who suddenly became rich because it turns out he’s the great-great-great-grand-nephew of James Madison and has been left a huge inheritance, allowing him to quit his job at Kellogg’s and become a public figure. It just doesn’t make sense. It’s completely unwarranted and completely inconsequential.
Not only did these people receive their positions based on zero merit, but they also have zero power. Beyonce probably holds more power than the royal family. Actually, Beyonce most definitely has more power. She and Jay Z could smash Kate and William into bite-sized pieces and eat them like a crumpet, if they wanted to. The royal family is full of mere figureheads who are not the rulers of the United Kingdom but are the designated faces of the country, balding and all. Their decisions aren’t important — no matter how important the media tries to make the fact that Kate decided to take a bus one day and went with a dashing red dress. Although some would argue that Elizabeth has significant influence, the royal family can’t directly implement critical political policies in the world. They’re normal people who have mass wealth and luxury showered all over them just for shits and giggles.
Most importantly, as we are Americans, they have absolutely nothing to do with us. At all. No connection, no relationship. Again, it’s not like they are important, influential figures who have the power to dramatically affect our country through politics, economics or warfare. The only power they have in America is whatever power the media and public imagination try to bestow upon them.
I understand why British people would care about them. They are part of their tradition and are the people who represent their country in the public eye. They’re a source of pride, a source of intrigue and a subject of adoration. And I do see how they can send a flutter through the hearts of romantics and wishful thinkers, as they seemingly give concreteness to fairy-tale idealism.
But the royal family should be left to the British. If you need your princess fix, just turn on “Princess Diaries,” a truly quality flick, and let Anne Hathaway whisk you away.
We Americans don’t need any more people to idolize or to be the objects of our daydreams about what it would be like to have their lives. We’re a culture that loves looking at incredibly wealthy and popular people with a yearning wonderment. But this serves no purpose except for making us “commoners” — so Queen Elizabeth scowls at the noisy couple eating dinner in her vicinity — feel even less satisfied with our lives.
By all means, the British royal family can do their thing in England, but I apologize: I don’t think I will ever be able to quite restrain myself from yelling an emphatic “Who cares!” whenever they surface in mainstream American media.

Since the bill, S. 444, failed to move past the subcommittee level, it faces dwindling odds ahead of the May 1 legislative deadline.
Good riddance.
Sen. Brad Hutto said he found it difficult to imagine any judge in South Carolina turning to Islamic law when deciding a case. We can’t either. Which is why it’s so puzzling that this bill would come up in the first place.
Our legislator’s time is better spent on far more pressing, tangible issues that face the growing population of South Carolina, rather than hypothetical scenarios and issues that have never once arisen in the Palmetto State.
Instead of pandering to voters whipped into hysteria over an imagined threat and a handful of incidents, our state representatives wisely chose to return their focus to the issues actually facing South Carolina.
South Carolina’s unemployment rate is at 9.9 percent. The Palmetto State ranks ninth in the country in the number of women murdered by men, according to the Violence Policy Center. Teen pregnancy continues to be an issue. In 2007, 10,754 girls in South Carolina ages 10-19 became pregnant, including 321 girls from Beaufort County. The health of our rivers and waterways are constantly under pressure and threaten to be jeopardized. The list goes on.
These are the issues actually facing South Carolina. And readers, they are legion.
To have spent even a moment of time wringing hands over a hypothetical situation was a waste of resources and we’re heartened to see lawmakers apply their time to more worthwhile endeavors.
A similar bill, H. 3490, is currently in the works and has yet to clear its originating body. Here’s hoping to that clearer heads prevail in that case as well, and lawmakers can return to addressing real problems and ignoring imaginary ones.Question
In my Bible Class we are going to study a lesson on Satan. To a Christian, Satan is a Fallen Angel who seeks to bring destruction and ruin to mankind. I just wanted to know an Islamic and Judaist viewpoint of Satan. I was surprised to learn that in Judaism Satan is seen as an agent of God, used to test believers. What do Muslims think of Satan? I would appreciate any help you could give to me. I like to study what people of other religions believe.
According to the Qur'an (the basic source of Islamic belief), when God created Adam (pbuh) and directed the assembly of angels to prostrate before Adam (pbuh), Iblis - a Jinn - was also present in the court. All the angels obediently prostrated before Adam (pbuh). However, Iblis - the Jinn - arrogantly refused to do so. This, obviously, was a transgression on the part of Iblis. It was this transgression of Iblis that made him deserving of the name 'Al-Shaitaan'[1] (the Satan). As a result of this transgression, God turned Iblis out of His court and sentenced him to punishment. However, Iblis asked God for respite till the Day of Judgment and declared that because God had turned him out of his court and had sentenced him to punishment because of man, he would therefore always be an enemy to man. He, and those who become his agents, would do all that they can to turn man away from the path of God and as a consequence, suffer the everlasting punishment of hellfire..
Thus, according to the Islamic belief, Iblis - the Satan - is neither a fallen angel, as the Christians believe, nor an agent of God. Islam introduces Iblis as a Jinn, who by his freewill opted to disobey God and transgress. God allowed Satan respite from punishment till an appointed time and gave him the authority only to the extent of suggesting evil to man. Iblis and his agents[2] - from among jinn as well as men - cannot force man into evil. They, however, can incite man to do what is against God's commandments and thereby lose the path of eternal success.
It should be kept in mind that the basic scheme of things in giving man life, according to the Qur'an, was to test him by giving him authority to choose between 'good' and 'evil'. It is, in fact, the incorrect use of this authority, which results in evil. It seems that the Jinn are also given the same authority. Iblis became 'the Satan' for no other reason except for using this freedom of choice for the wrong end.

This time last year the azaleas, forsythia, and daffodils were all in bloom. I was posting signs of spring. Though we didn't get the forecasted snow today, we did get sleet and lots of cold rain. It's bleak out there. They're forecasting another storm for Sunday-Monday, maybe through Tuesday. Predictions of much rain, wind and cold temperatures for Monday, the day of the Boston Marathon, our official first day of spring around these parts. The runners might prefer cool temps to warm or hot, but high winds and sopping rain can't be good. The hearty marathon supporters will come out to cheer the runners on, I have no doubt of that. But it's just, well, yucky.
At least Saturday is looking good - partly sunny and around 50ºF. I'll be sure to get outside for a good long walk. Friday night, tomorrow after work, I have another GNO (girls nite out) in Boston that should be lots of fun. And Saturday it appears I'll have some dinner plans.
In Paris, it is already printemps it seems - in the 70's. Hopefully that will continue when I'm there (just a little over two weeks now!).
Sorry to hear that. Spring seems late for you in the East this year - almost as if winter, which started late, wants to stick around full term. Hope it gets warm soon!
After a short spell of dry weather and some sun, we're back to cool and rainy, with a heavy rainfall warning! So Paris and much of Europe does sound inviting with their summery temperatures.

So I have a habit of being behind on both catching up and sharing news. The news I'm still aware of is probably as old and outdated as the news these folks are reading in this picture.
Alas, better late than never so the saying goes. Anyway, here's some past and coming happenings I'd like for all of the blogworld to know:
Orla from Old Market Gallery at Rotherham, UK is starting a zine library and amassing quite the international collection as I write this! Orla contacted me via the great online zine network We Make Zines to submit my zine Let's Be Happy (shameless plug here!). Here's an article about Orla's efforts to spread the awesomeness of DIY self-publishing worldwide.
Next news: The Twin Cities Zine fest is making way! Here's local coverage on the event by the Metro highlighting a zine raffle where I donated FruitYoga for the cause.
Well, that's all folks!!!:
Students at West Newton Elementary School recently completed reading fair projects, part of a "Paws for Literacy" competition.
The students created colorful summaries of fiction and nonfiction books they had read. WNES media specialist Keisa Gatewood said students have been working on the projects — which were part of their studies of reading, language arts, science and social studies — for a couple of months.
Gatewood said class winners were chosen at each grade level; a school-wide winner will be named Dec. 12. The overall winner will receive an Atlanta Falcons Package that includes four tickets to a game plus food and parking vouchers.
This was the first year for the Paws for Literacy program.BusinessWeek Investor -- Inside Wall Street
Why Pioneer Could Get Ambushed
Take a battered stock, figure in some industry consolidation and a 63-year-old CEO with no heir apparent, and it adds up to a company that is a potential takeover target.
That's how things appear at Pioneer-Standard Electronics (PIOS), an electronics distributor, says Edward Shadek of Putnam Investments, the second-largest institutional investor with a near $19 million stake as of Sept. 30. The Cleveland electronics company stocks about 400,000 items--computers, circuits, and semiconductors--which it ships to resellers, manufacturers, and corporations worldwide. IBM, Compaq, and Intel alone account for about 60% of sales.
Two Big Board-listed Pioneer rivals--$2.7 billion Arrow Electronics and $1.9 billion Avnet--have a lock on about 50% of the market. That makes third-ranked Pioneer, with its $300 million market cap, a likely buyout candidate, according to Shadek. "I don't think it's a stretch to think you'd get 20 [a share]," he says. Pioneer currently trades at 11 5/8, down from its 52-week high of 18 3/4 on Mar. 1. While the cyclical in tech is a concern, says Shadek, there are more pluses for Pioneer than minuses: First Call's consensus earnings forecast of $1.46 per share for the fiscal year ending Mar. 1, 2001, for a stock that trades at seven times earnings, "doesn't have a lot of downside," says Shadek. "A lot of the bad news is built in." Robert Damron of Tucker Anthony agrees that the stock has at least 100% upside in 12 to 18 months.Der Hovanesian Covers the Markets.; Gene Marcial Is on Vacation.; By Mara Der HovanesianReturn to top
Return to topMarathon day started out by getting up at 3:30 a.m. so I could leave at 5 a.m. for the team bus. Even though I had put all my running clothes, food, etc., out the night before I wanted time to have coffee, shower and make sure I had everything. The bus was pretty full and I sat up front with my friend Mary. It was her first Boston too. It was fun being with everyone and chatting along the way.
We reached Hopkinton around 7 a.m. and parked with a bunch of other buses. My wave wasn’t set to head out until 11:25 so we had some time to kill. I got off the bus a couple times to walk around and use the porta-potty. I also ate my breakfast of oatmeal and banana. Later I had a peanut butter sandwich, some Cliff bar and pretzels. It was hard to figure out how much to eat because of the long wait. We headed over to the Athletes’ Village around 9:30 and had to go through a check point where they ran a wand up and down our bodies. The village was full of runners and many were resting on blankets. Most of the people I was with were in the wave ahead of me so when they departed I was by myself. I headed over to the porta-potties to wait in line and ended up talking to a guy from Florida who had run Boston 5 times, along with several other Cape Cod races. When my corral was called for the 4th wave I followed the runners where we filed through different cordoned-off sections. We seemed to be walking for quite some time when I asked another runner how far it was to the start. He said it was 7 tenths of a mile! As we got closer the other corrals broke off to the side. Since I was in the first corral I felt like a VP as we went right up to the starting line. As we waited a young woman beside me wished me good luck and I wished her the same. After a short ceremony we were off and running exactly at our specified time of 11:25. Yup, I was running the Boston Marathon.
I was excited but also struggling with the fact I had 26.2 miles to go and I had already been up for 8 hours. When I should have been taking it all in, I was instead fighting demons in my head . I wanted to go home! The only thing that calmed me down was knowing I had run from Hopkinton to Boston College two weeks prior and knew I could do it. I calmed down a bit and focused on enjoying the spectators; there were the guys at the biker bar, people dancing to loud music, a guy playing drums on his porch, kids sticking their hands out for high-fives, humorous hand-held signs, etc.
The weather had warmed up and I decided I should hit most of the water stops rather than go to every other. After drinking some Gatorade I noticed it was causing some cramping in my stomach. I caught up with Kevin Petrovek (owner of Hanlons and the one who gave me the waiver) and told him about my distress. He told me to dilute the Gatorade with water but try not to drink too much of it. He actually carries flat Coke in his fuel belt. Then I spotted my friend Hilary, who was walk/running the course due to an injury. We ran together for a few minutes before she stopped to walk. In Natick I spotted my friend and former co-worker, Ken, and his wife Kate. I gave him a hug, chatted for a minute and then asked his wife to take our photo. When I reached Wellesley I started looking for my family (mom, sisters, niece, husband, step son). It actually gave me a lift knowing they were close by. When I spotted them I ran over and chatted for a minute before taking off.
My stomach was still bothering me and my legs were starting to feel the effects of running downhill (the first half of the course is all downhill). By mile 15 my legs got worse. I was able to run the first hill in Newton but couldn’t manage the other three so I walked instead. I was also feeling the 70-ish-degree heat so I wet the bandana I had around my wrist – another runner saw it and said it was a great idea. I also put it around my neck to help cool me off and filled it with ice that was being handed out on the course. Spectators always seem to know what runners need: Kleenex, wipes, orange slices, Vaseline, candy. My bandana really was a lifesaver.
After cresting Heart Break Hill at mile 21 we headed downhill. It bothered my legs but at least I could run again. One great comfort was knowing there was a medical tent every mile after that. As I struggled with dizziness, nausea and leg cramps I contemplated quitting but soldiered on. At mile 22 I felt someone come up beside me and put their arm around me. It was my friend Lori, who trained with our group this winter. She walked with me for a couple minutes and gave me words of encouragement before taking off. That was the lift I needed.
As I passed more medical tents I was tempted to stop and ask for salt tabs but I was afraid they would want to assess me and not let me run. I knew I wasn’t in the best condition, but felt I wasn’t in immediate danger. I just wanted that medal so badly. Surprisingly the miles went by quickly throughout the race. When someone shouted we had four miles to go I knew I could do it. When it was down to two – I pictured the 2-mile loop I had run in my neighborhood. As I got closer to the finish the crowds grew thicker and louder (weird how the Wellesley girls didn’t seem loud at all to me earlier). I ran as much as my legs could take before walking. Once onto Boylston Street I vowed to run the rest of the way. I could see the finish, and wow, it looked so far away. I kept running only to feel like I wasn’t making much progress – was the finish line moving?! I finally crossed over and managed to raise my arms up in victory. From there I was intent on finding the people handing out medals. As mine was placed around my neck, I reached down and tilted it up so I could see it. Then I cried – and still get teary-eyed when I think or talk about it.
As luck would have it my friends and training buddies, Lori and Christine, spotted me. They gave me hugs and I told them I wasn’t feeling well and needed something to eat. We got our blankets and were handed food bags. My legs were still cramping and they nearly seized as I stepped up onto a sidewalk. The walk to the hotel where our club had rented a room was about a mile away due to detours. When we got there a small group was heading out and one woman told me I had to get my things and head right to the bus. I told her there was no way I could do it, so Christine said she would drive me home. Thank God. Back at the hotel I drank a Pepsi to settle my stomach and had something to eat, followed by a shower. That got me well enough to walk to the parking garage and head home with my friends.
Since I was feeling so badly I didn’t think I could write a positive blog about the race. But eventually the pain and suffering was replaced by many positive memories. The runners, volunteers and spectators were the absolute best. So many thanked us for running. Strangers were so helpful and kind. The support was incredible. It was an experience of a lifetime. I still can’t believe I ran and finished the Boston Marathon. Me!![PaizoCon 2015] What's New with Legendary Games - Friday afternoon, 3:00-4:00 pm,

Search this Thread:
Rownig and Mazrim were walking ahead of the remaining members of the party.
Helgen - You cannot tell how many prints there are, and they have to be pointed out to you for you to see them at all (they are faint, and drying as the afternoon sun shines down). They do look like boot prints, and not foot prints, I should have been more clear about that.
Someone might be able to track them
Everyone
Do you have a plan?
"keep t'gether and keep yer eyes open. Weapons out. We're takin' th' detour."
Hal begins to move down the trail where the tracks lead.
Helgen will follow Hallister, his hammer at the ready.
Rowning pulls off his shortbow and grabs an arrow as he heads down the path. Since Hallister took the lead, Rownig will walk five feet behind him.
Mazrim waits at the edge of the road waving everyone else forward. Speaking quietly while watching the two spears behind the rocks "I'll take the rear, everyone else follow Hallister"
The path that leaves the road, on the south side, just before the gorge, is step, but not difficult. There are loose rocks, shale, and gravel, but there are also large rocks embedded in the ground that are placed almost as if they were put there on purpose. The path is five feet wide, and runs downward for thirty feet where it turns to the left, at about a forty five degree angle, and forks. The path continues to curve, eventually turning southward and following the river, at a height of eight to ten feet above the water, but it also forks to the right and curves toward the underside of the bridge.
Hallister is in the lead, followed by Helgen, Rownig, Moralane, Atharessa, Azram, and then Mazrim bringing up the rear. When Mazrim steps off of the road, behind the line of the others, he hears a shout from the other side of the bridge. He can’t make out the word, but it sounds like, “Hey!”
Just at that moment, Hallister sees a dwarven man step out from under the bridge, followed by three others. They are moving quickly, but they are surprised to see you’ve come this far. They stop, in a space just ten feet by teen feet, just to the south of the bridge, and at the bottom of the trail you are following. There is fifteen feet of open trail between Hallister and the dwarven men. The dwarf in the lead is older, wearing leather armor, and carrying a long sword. He wears a leather cap, with a short brim, that looks more like a driver’s hat than any kind of armor. The other three dwarves are not wearing armor and their clothing is ragged and worn. Two of them are armed with clubs, bu the third has a loaded crossbow (it is difficult to tell from the crowding and the angle if it is a light or heavy crossbow).
The old dwarven man in the lead of the group below shouts, “Hold on thar pilgrims. Where is it tha’ yer thinks yer going, eh? This is private property, and yer tres pass inin. It’s terrible dangerous terrain down this way, not safe for men and women like yerselves, so go back the way ya came, and be good fellows and pay the nice men at the bridge yer toll. Don’t make trouble and ya won’t get none from me.”
(Technically you have the initiative and a surprise round to act, before he finishes what he is saying. You can roll for your initiative in the discussion thread. If you mean to act first and ask questions later, do not roll initiative, and instead, just list what action you would take, and any very specific things that could happen that might change your mind.)
"Wait, wait." Hal says with a disbelieving stare and a stifled laugh. "Did ye jus' tell us where t' go so yer boys could extort money from us, but tell us ye dinnae want trouble? Pal, ye got a real strange way o' not lookin' fer trouble."
"Tell ye what, how's about ye give us a hand wit' our little errand, an' then we pay ye fer yer services? What d' ye usually charge fer yer 'bridge toll'"
Helgen will move up to the front of the line even with Hallister, but say nothing for the moment.
Can these people not count? We outnumber them seven to five and we're all armed.
Mazrim keeps an eye behind them just incase there are more that he hasn't noticed.
Rownig notches his arrow and ready's his acton.
Scanning the faces and the he looks over the terrain for any additonal bandits.
Perception: 1d20 + 7 ⇒ (20) + 7 = 27 Apparently his eyes are honed in this day.
The old Dwarf has a confused look on his face, and says, “We’re not looking for trouble, but you are if you’ve come this way. Are you lost, is that it? Where’re ya tryin to get to anyway? If yous a mind to cross the river, the bridge is the only way, less than you be thinking of swimmin, and the waters mighty fast, so that’s never a good idea. So just go back up the path, pay the toll, and cross the bridge, Eh? What’s this you’re say’n? You’re on an errand? What kind of Errand? Look’it it’s not safe to be fool’n around on this path, so let’s all go back to the road, and talk there.”
Rownig draws his bow string and shoots near the shadow at the bottom of the path. Not attempting to hit the person, or creature, just a warning shot to call it out. "Ye don't need t'be, if ye mean us no harm."
Bow Shot: 1d20 + 2 + 2 ⇒ (2) + 2 + 2 = 6 The additional +2 was for higher ground, if that applies. As the arrow stick in the ground a good distance way fromthe shadow.
"Are ye daft? We aint lost, we ain't crossin' the bridge, an' we're def'nitly not payin' you a gods damned thing jus' fer th' privilege o' walkin'. So yer either gonna help us out an' make some money or yer gonna leave us be an' go on yer merry way."
Wattching Rownig's shot he says "An' ye c'n tell any friends ye got they c'n come out an' say hi. We ain't in any mood fer this s@*+."
"You've got some stones old man. Drop your weapons and hit the dirt. NOW!" Helgen says with a loud growl.
Intimidate 1d20 + 3 ⇒ (19) + 3 = 22
So much for the pleasantries
Mazrim will raise his weapon and take a defensive posture.
Declaring a ready action to trip any enemy that steps into his reach (and will use any attack of opportunity to trip as well)
Hal looks at Helgen with undisguised aggravation on his face.
F$*@ing dammit, kid!
Looking back at the older dwarf and his band, he waited.
Let's see what they do.
Rownig notches another arrow. Glad I was aiming to miss on that one. Me finger's a pick lazy on that last draw.
When Helgen growls, the Dwarves below on the path take a small shuffle backward, and the old Dwarf says, pointing to the long reach of Mazrimn’s weapon, “Alright, we understand each other, well and good, we want no trouble, and you want no trouble, Tanner, come out of there.” The person, who steps out of the shadows, is not a dwarf, but is a small green skinned gnome (a half Dwarf, half Goblin). You can’t tell if it is a boy or a girl, but the gnome is young, and wears clothes much too large. “Tanner won’t do you no harm. Now please, leave us alone. We don’t mean to trouble you good folks. Go on your way. But I still don’t know why you came down here. I am telling the truth that there is no way across the river here. If it’s help you’re looking for, there is little to nothing we can offer you, we don’t mean to harm travelers. We ask a toll, and only what a traveler can spare, to buy food, and goods. Listen stranger, we were once soldiers, like yourselves, and by the look of you, and your determination, you're working for one of the wealthier nobles, unlike us, we’ve been discharged. We’ve no place to call home. No land to farm and nearly nothing left to sell. If you’re lost, we’ll help you find your way, but there is little else we can offer you.”
"Ah c'n unnerstand bein' down on yer luck. Ye have t' recognize tha' t' us this looks like common banditry. Yer all armed, ye had ambushers waitin' under th' bridge an on th' other side o' it. Yer all armed. That don't send a friendly message, ye know?"
Tapping his chin, he thinks a moment. "But it sounds t' me like you lot aint got much. Ah got an offer fer you an' yer boys. We're tasked t' find out whatever we can 'bout th' attacks commin' outta Witch's Valley. Ah think we're walkin' inta some bad business an' there ain't 'nough o us. We got a bit o' coin fer our expenses. Ah'm willin' t' feed the lot o ye an pay ye t' boot if'n yer willin' to join us an' watch our backs. If'n ah'm wrong, ye jus git paid t' walk out there an' back wit' us. If ah'm right, it's gonna be bad, but anyone who makes it back 'll be a hero o' th' kingdom."
Helgen frowns, but allows them to respond to Hallister's offer.
Mazrim will relax a little but still keeps his weapon at hand.
"Hallister is right, we could use extra men on this journey and if you're willing to join us I'm sure you'll be in a better position than you're in now."
Rownig simply listens and watches the crowd's reponse. Doubt they want a death march.
“Witch’s Valley, you say. Well now I understand why you came this way after all. You intend to follow the river southward into the valley. That’s not very wise, it’s a rough way, but it will be shorter than going the long way around, I suppose. You say you’ll pay us to watch your back, alright let’s talk about that. I’ have, well, let’s say I have contacts up this river, people I know, who might make trouble for you and your friends, so if the money’s good we’ll take you as far as Witch’s Valley, and try to keep you out of trouble on the way. There are six of us, and Thomaz and Ulan have wives and children. We can’t all go with you, but I will go."
"My name is Turrand, and Tanner will come with me, I’ll explain along the way why. Galana, Voranzil! Get down here!” He shouts. “Pack your things, we’re taking a trip up river. These two will go with us, and Orson here,” he points at the Dwarf holding the crossbow, “will come as well. Thomaz and Ulan will stay and keep our camp here. It will take us well past dark to reach the village near Eight Fountain Springs. It’s not far, but it is all up hill, and we’ll have to climb a few short cliffs. There could be danger along the way. So, stranger, I’ve told you our names, and I’m willing to hear what you’ll offer. We’ll show you the safest way up the canyon, and take you to Eight Fountain Springs, but not for less than five silvers each. Once we reach the village, I’ll talk to the head woman there, she might not want to see you folks hang around, but I’ll see what I can do. She’s a tough one, but she’s fair. The village is small, and they don’t like, well that don’t like strangers. What do you say?”
Hal nods, not quite ready to offer his name yet, but definitely willing to negotiate.
"So the five o' ye, fer no less'n five silvers each. Sounds fair. I'll even do ye one better. Ye'll each git one silver now, two silvers at the halfway mark, and four at th' end o' the trip. Tha's seven each in total. In addition when we're some place we c'n buy meals an' rooms, we'll cover 'em for ye. Other'n that yer in charge o' yer own supplies. Sound fair?"
Rownig stands back watching, listening as Hallister negotiates with the Turrand. Trying to ascetain Turrand's trustworthiness. Sense Motive: 1d20 + 6 ⇒ (14) + 6 = 20
Rownigs's impression is that Turrand is sincere when he is speaking of how they (Turrand's little band of mercenaries) are living at a poverty level, but he is definitely being evasive when it comes to his offspring.
Now Tanner is obviously a gnome, and in this campaign setting Gnomes are not a race unto themselves, but are half-breeds (being half-dwarf and half-goblin, but otherwise have all of the racial characteristics of Pathfinder gnomes, generally speaking). Now if Turrand admits that Tanner is his child, then Turrand has had a relationship with a Goblin woman. Normally, that is among most Dwarves, this kind of relationship is frowned upon, but not treated harshly. Dwarven miners, living in remote areas where it is difficult to keep a Dwarven family, one accustomed to a certain quality of life anyway, often engage with goblins in this way. It is a social taboo, but one that is quietly ignored.
Turrand accepts Hallisters offer, with a nod and a smile, and says, “Let’s be on our way. There is a foot path here that follows the river, southward, it is narrow at times and we should go single file. I’ll lead, if you’re comfortable with that. It’s a steady uphill walk for about two miles, and then we have to climb about fifty feet up a rocky escarpment to another trail above. That trail is a treacherous one and follows a ridge line that we’ll have to take slowly, after that it is another three miles to the valley, and the village near Eight Fountain Springs. The place where we’ll need to be on our guard is just after the climb. There are some goblins in some caves along that ridge, and they are not the kind of goblins we’ll be able to negotiate with. Our best hope is that if we do encounter them, we’ll out number them by enough that they’ll just shout a few insults our way, and leave us be.”
Two Dwarves appear at the back of the party. They do not approach in a threatening way, and announce themselves well in advance. The two of them say, “Excuse us,” as they make their way through your ranks, and down toward the camp under the bridge. Both of these Dwarves wear leather armor, and carry spears. One of them wears a large helmet, this one is probably Voranzil, and he is a middle aged male Dwarf. The other Dwarf, the one called Galana, is a young Dwarven girl, with red hair, cut very short. She looks to be younger than Atharessa, and is perhaps barely out of her teens.
Rownig notices the leather armor on two dwarves working their way through the ranks. He asks one "Ye know where a dwarf can git 'imself some leather armor for a fair price?'
Helgen unhappy about the new additions to their ranks, but unsure of anything he can reasonably do about it simply follows the other dwarves silently. He keeps his hammer ready and avoids conversation for now, making sure to keep behind the newcomers to the group.
"Ah'll be right b'hind ye."[b] Hal says. [b]"The name's Hallister, by th' way. we appreciate your help."
Mazrim will follow along afterwards within easy speaking distance of Turrand, "So Turrand, what can you tell us of the area we're heading to?"
As the two Dwarves pass by Rownig, he asks, “Ye know where a dwarf can git 'imself some leather armor for a fair price?” and Voranzil replies, “Oh, aye, we’ve a bit of leather armor here in the camp. But a fair price, now what is that, today, does anybody know. Have you anything to trade? I need a new pair of boots, and in the city they want forty silvers for a pair built tough enough to last more than a season. If Turrand agrees I could sell you a leather tunic, for ten silver, I suppose, but soft leather scraps would be more welcome.”
Turrand disappears back under the bridge, he talks, without trying to lower his voice or cause you to be suspicious, to the others in the camp as he collects a backpack, a water skin, and some fresh fish on a line. He hands the line to Galana, overhears Voranzil talking to Rowning, at just about the same time he is headed up the path to the fork, when Mazrim asks him, "So Turrand, what can you tell us of the area we're heading to?"
“The gorge, or Witch’s Valley? Well let me tell you, oh just a moment, you say you need armor. I can fit a few of you with leather, and I’ve one suit of chain that’s too large to fit any of us, we traded a haul of salmon for that, seemed like a good trade at the time, but haven’t run across anyone who would pay or trade fair for it. We need tools, a saw, hammers, shovels, and a pound of nails would do us more good than you know. We’ve been thinking of moving down river and building a lodge close to the shore. I have a resource upriver who will fell us a few good sized trees and float them down to us, but I’ve been putting it off until we have all the material we will need. Oh, and an adze, a few chisels, that would be nice as well. I don’t like to bargain for coin, really, it seems that we can’t get anything in the city for a fair price, and trade always does us better.”
“The gorge is beautiful, the water runs fast and tumbles over several rocky drops, the spay keeps it cool, but sometimes the rocks along the path are washed, after a hard rain, and it can be slippery. We’ll take it slow, stay close to the canyon wall, where we can. We'll eventually get to Patterman’s Falls, that’s a fifty foot drop, it’s not straight down and the salmon make it up the channels, we’ll climb up the cliffs on the east side, but there are caves in those cliffs, and a tribe, they call themselves Red Throats, sometimes they camp there. The salmon aren’t spawning, so I wouldn’t expect to run into them, now, but you can never know. There is a small lake below the falls, just an acre or so in size, but the fishing is good. After that is a steady incline to the valley, and the river has three switchbacks. Now we can try and cross, if you’re good swimmers, we can even get a rope across, but if we don’t, it’ll add a few hours to the trip. Up that way you might see wild goats, and there have been trolls, but not for a few months, they seem to have migrated to the east, higher into the mountains.”
“The valley, Witch’s valley is just about the prettiest place I know. It gets a lot of rain, and there are streams and creeks all over. It’s rolling country, perfect for farming, and there are a lot of villages, Dwaven and Goblin alike. The villages are small, and not friendly. The King’d put some noble down in those lands and tame them, but for two reasons. It’s damn near impossible to get anything grown in the valley out of the valley until someone tries to put a sturdy bridge over the gap in the west, or worse, cut this river down to size. I’ve heard stories that the humans have built things called locks, that raise and lower boats along rivers like this one, but to tell you what I think, there’s no money in the King’s treasury to pay for that kind of work here. The second reason is this, and I’ll be damned if you’ll find anyone who will admit to it, but the valley, it’s good and fertile, and populated by a lot of folk who don’t want to pay taxes, even if they could grow enough that it won’t be nothing to them. But what I’m trying to say is this. Any noble going into that valley will be fighting the locals every step of the way, and there just ain’t no money in that. Hell’s Dead Winds boy, why do you think we’re free men, because some noble ran out of money to pay us.”
Turrand walks at a steady pace zigzagging up the trail, around boulders and piles of rocks as he talks. There are short hardy trees growing out of the ground in places, and small patches of grass and wild flowers, where the sun shines. Mostly you walk in a cool shadow, and feel a light mist from the water tumbling over rocks ten to twenty feet below and to your right.
“Once we get near the valley, the river will turn west, and actually breaks apart into several streams. There are more than eight of them, and sometimes they change, one’ll dry up, or the water will find a new way down out of the mountains, but up those mountains, to the west, there are springs, and some people say that up there are eight fountains built by folk who lived on these islands thousands of years ago. I ain’t never seen them. We won’t follow the river, but we’ll go south, we should be able to see a village set between two low hills once we get to end of this gorge. That village is called Eight Fountains Village, and it is run by a Goblin headwoman. They got all kinds living in that village, so if you’ve a mind for looking down on people who don’t look and act like yourselves it’s going to be a shock for you. And they don’t like strangers, well they don’t like strangers coming into their village and telling folks how to live their lives, so keep your mouths shut, and let me do the talking. I don’t think there’s an inn, the kind you folks are used to, but there are barns, dry and warm, and we can find a place to sleep for the night. Maybe even get a meal. It’ll be full on dark by the time we get there. The moon’s will be in half and half so we won’t be coming into the village in the dead dark night, still, it will be touch and go there, so keep you wits and weapons under control. A little display like that arrow back at my camp will get us all killed for sure.”
“There’s one more thing. Folks don't use this gorge to travel to the valley for another reason. At the second switchback of the river, before the valley, is a little clearing. It’s a good sized piece of land, and there was once a mining camp there, but the mine ran out. Now there are bandits, real bandits that live in that camp. These are hard folks, and they will not want to negotiate or listen to your boasts and growls, they’ll want to cut us down and take everything we have. I’ve not got enough men to challenge them, but if we work together I think we can drive them off long enough to get by their camp. I know they have friends in the mountains, so if we do drive them off, we ain’t coming back this way, and it will be the long road back for us. Where you folks decide to go after we reach Eight Fountains, is your business. But if you agree to stand with me and challenge these bandits for the camp, I’ll make sure you get what you need in the village. I’ve seen enough of my kinsmen’s blood spilled over the years, I’ll make a show of force, or make a run for it, but if we stand and take them on to the last man, and I ain’t saying we are sure to lose, but if it comes to that, it will be the real thing.”
Turrand comes to a short rocky obstacle, and he climbs, hand over foot, up about eight feet, turns and looks down at the whole group of you and says, “From here it’s going to be a hard climb, and it will take something out of us. We’ll build a fire here, eat something, and rest for a bit, then you folks, all of you, can decide if we are going to do this thing or not. Take the long road, all the way around, or face what is sure to be a hard fight. Think about your friends, loved ones, family, and be ready to decide after we’ve finished off the fish and smoked a pipe.”
"I personally can't abide people that prey on others. I think we should get rid of that group of bandits, all of them."
"I agree with Mazrim," Moralane says. "Times are hard all over, but you don't see everyone turning to crime. Some work the land, or the sea, to make their living. It may not always be a life of luxury, but it is honest work. In my father's house, we have tried very hard to keep everyone fed and in a dry home. You don't see as many bandits in our county as you do in others.If there are people who use violence to take from others, they should be stopped, and since they use violence, that is what they should get."
Edit: Bah! Double ninja'd....
Helgen listens to everything that Turand has to say while walking along with the group. "Agreed, bandits need to be dealt with. We can't afford to waste time anyways." He drifts back to walk along next to Moralane. "Glad to hear we agree on this one, I was just about to ask your opinion."
"Aye Voranzil, fair price is a matter of point of view. Don't have boots to trade, but that'll b eon the list for the next time I'm coming this way from the city." Pausing, "A leather tunic would help, two if ye got 'em - me an me companion there." thumb pointing towards Azram.
Hearing Turand, "Got an extra hammer I could give, and pound of marbles, and a pint of oil that's about all the extra goods that I've got on me person."
"As ye can see I'm a bit lean for dwarf's standards, so the chain won't work for me."
"I won't shoot no arrow in the village." Nodding towards Turand.
Azram has much the same equipment as Rownig, so a pint of oil. We could spare 100 ft of hemp rope and one grappling hook between the two of us.
"Dealin' with local color ain't our mission." Hallister growls, looking around at the rest of his group.
Turning to Turrand, he shrugs. "You want 'em dealt wit', an' need our help t' do it, well, that sounds t' me like another business negotiation. We're payin' you t' watch our backs to the valley, but we didn't intend on pickin' fights on the way there. It's one thing t' drive 'em off so we c'n git through. It's another t' endanger our mission t' rout 'em fer good. What c'n ye offer us that'd make it worth the risk?"
“Um, what?” Turrand stammers from above. “Look, lad, we’ll help you find your way, get you to the village, and keep our eyes and ears open for the dangers we know about, but I’m not asking you to do anything you don’t want to do. Seems like your friends and you have a difference of opinion on the matter, so why don’t you take the time while we eat to agree, among yourselves, just how much of a risk you’re willing to take. We’ve enough show of force to put those bandits on the run, I hope, but if they stand and fight, well, all I’m offering is that we won’t abandon your people and I hope you won’t abandon us, together we are stronger. I’m not even going to offer to pay you or any of your friends to stand with us, if you won’t stand, should they decide to fight us instead of take to the hills, then we’ll just make a run for Eight Fountains, once we are within sight of the town wall, any bandits chasing us will be sure to give up. You can try to keep up, or choose to run some other direction, that’s your choice. But the matter is simply this, we try and run ‘em off long enough to get far enough away that they won’t consider coming after us with reinforcements, or, if they don’t run away and choose to face us head on, we either run for our lives, apart, or stand, together.”
Rownig steps up to Hallister, Mazrim, Azram, and Helgen gathering them together. Then he begins to speak, "me vote is to 'elp these folks out. Banditry can't be tolerated, I know it's not part of the group mission but I've been asked to look for a particular bandit. Maybe he's in that group, if so I have a job to do."
Looking at each members eyes.
Helgen nods. "It's the most expedient route to our destination, and who's to say that we wouldn't just encounter more bandits if we had to travel the long way around instead? I'm not proposing we hunt down all the bandits and kill them, simply that we do what we need to do to get past the ones in our way. Turrand has the right of it." He looks at Hallister. "Believe me, our mission is my number one priority."
Hal sighs. "Fine."
Damn kids an' their bleedin' hearts.
"Sure hope this 's worth th' extra risk."
"You're quite the mercenary Hal. Can you give us any reason aside from the fact that we weren't ordered to stop bandits to convince us that we should let them continue plaguing the people living here?"
Mazrim finds a spot to rest and turns to Antheressa "You've been very quiet, what do you think?"
"Ah ain't a mercenary. Ah also ain't a soldier or a sheriff. Ah've stuck mah neck out for more people Ah didn't ever know than the whole lot o' ya put together, but Ah never did it needlessly." Hal scowls.
"Ah just know how t' look at the bigger picture. If'n one o' us gets dead on th' end o' some bandit's spear that's one less person when we git t' the Valley. That's mah concern. A few bandits are way lower on may list o' priorities than the plague o' creatures we're supposed t' be dealin' with."
Atharessa steps close to the group,and says, "It sounds dangerous, but look around. There are a lot of us, and we are armed. Unless these bandits number as many or more of us, I think we'll probably scare them off."
"I have to agree with Hallister, somewhat," Azram says, "But then again Rownig makes a good point. I just don't know. Look at if from Hallisters point of vies. We don't even know what we'll be facing, and it doesn't sound like these people are interested in searching for the Palace, and I don't even know if we should mention that at all, until we get to the village he is talking about. But Rownig is right, we can't just ignore them if they are hurting other good folk."
"Hallister is right," Moralane moves in close keeping her voice down. "We can't forget that the people who sent us on this mission are expecting us to fail. I've already told you that. So why take a chance to make that happen. I say we make a show of force, and run the bandits off, if the stand to fight, we make a run for it."
"No," Azram shakes his head. "That puts all of us at risk. If the bandits fight, we should fight back."
"We can take them. I know we can," Atharessa says, and smiles at everyone.
"It's settled, Moralane. Wish they thought like ye, but Ah can't really disagree with their reasons. Sometimes the good thing aint th' smart thing." Hal says with a shrug. "Mosta these boys ain't never seen a real fight anyways. They wanna do a good deed, an' we might as well git alla you blooded now rather than later. This 's as good a way as any."
"How many o' ye 'ave actually killed a man b'fore?"
"I've fought but I've never killed." Helgen says looking at the ground uncomfortably and kicking a stone.
"Pretty soon, yer gonna. Make peace wit' th' idea now. That goes fer alla ye. People are gonna die, an yer gonna be th' ones that kill 'em. The right reasons fer doin' it make good armor against the weight o' th' notion, but in th' end you gotta come t' grips wit' the fact that yer killin' people because you can. Everythin' else is just rationalization."
Hal looks around at them. "An' that's the hardest part. Ye gotta admit t' yerself that ye can, an' be willin' t' live wit' yerself after. The fight can be avoided, so yer choosin' this. In effect, yer killin' 'em right now. It ain't self defense. It ain't murder either. It's jus' killin', an' once ye get past the idea that shouldn't is really the only reason that most folk don't, you have t' face the fact that it's easy an' it don't actually change ye at all. Yer still jus' you livin' in a world wit' one less them. Only it's yer fault. Takin' responsibility is th' hardest part o' anythin'. Once it's yours an' ye own it, yer a killer, an that's that."
"So ye better get used t' the idea now, cause if it makes ye freeze up in th' moment, well, then th' other guy's th' killer an the world has one less o' you."
"I won't hesitate. The gods can sort them out." Helgen replies.
"I doubt anyone will hesitate when the time comes, after all we are all out here ready to face death itself."
Hearing the group's decision Rownig turns away and heads towards Turrand, pulling him to the side for a private..- The Archdiocese of Washington received good news this morning as Pope Benedict XVI announced that he is appointing Monsignor Barry Knestout to serve as an auxiliary bishop for the 580,000 faithful in the region..- The Archdiocese of Washington received good news this morning as Pope Benedict XVI announced that he is appointing Monsignor Barry Knestout to serve as an auxiliary bishop for the 580,000 faithful in the region.
With the addition of Bishop-elect Knestout, the archdiocese, which serves Catholics in an area that includes the nation’s capitol, will have four auxiliary bishops to meet the needs of a diverse flock.
Bishop-elect Knestout was born in 1962 in Cheverly, Maryland, just southeast of Washington D.C. According to a biography on the Archdiocese of Washington’s website, the bishop-elect is one of nine children and grew up in Bowie, Maryland, with the exception of a four-year stint in Ankara, Turkey.
The newly appointed bishop attended St. Pius X elementary school and Bowie Senior High School before receiving a bachelor’s degree in architecture from the University of Maryland in December 1984. He entered Mount St. Mary’s Seminary in Emmitsburg, Maryland in 1985 to study for the priesthood and was ordained a priest in June 1989.
He currently serves as moderator of the curia and vicar for administration, a position that is best described as the “chief of staff” for the archdiocese’s central offices.
Bishop-elect Knestout was also involved in the planning for Pope Benedict XVI’s visit to the U.S. this past April. While serving as co-chair of the Planning Committee for the papal visit, he utilized his architectural background to help run the contest for Catholic University of America architecture students, who competed to design the altar and chair used by the Pope at Nationals Stadium.
In addition to being named an auxiliary for the Archdiocese of Washington, Msgr. Knestout has been appointed titular bishop of Leavenworth. Bishop-elect Knestout will be ordained a bishop on December 29, 2008, the Monday of Christmas week.Release: 08/29/2013

It's hard for me to sit down and watch a TV show or movie for long periods of time. But every now and then, I come across an actor or actress who knows how to grab my attention and keep it.
1. Hyacinth Bucket, played by actress Patricia Routledge. If you haven't ever seen an episode of BBC's "Keeping Up Appearances", you haven't been entertained. I don't know if this sitcom was meant to be the British equivalent to "I Love Lucy", but in my opinion, it totally supersedes. What makes Hyacinth a great character? She's ambitious, quirky, and a gentle-hearted snob! Hyacinth makes watching a train wreck fun! I love her facial expressions!
2. Sir Percival Blakeney, played by actor Anthony Andrews. I didn't much care for the old black-and-white version of "The Scarlet Pimpernel", but when I saw the movie staring Anthony Andrews, it was all over. What makes Sir Percy a great character? Just everything. He is an English aristocrat who uses the cover of a flaky, shallow-minded dandy to hide his heroic ambitions to save the lives of French aristocrats during the French Revolution. Plus he's super romantic. Sink me, he's one of the best male characters ever.
3. Susan Vance, played by actress Katherine Hepburn. "Bringing Up Baby" is my all time favorite movie, and not because the story centers around a leopard (although that certainly helps). What makes Susan a great character? She's a both a charming, ditsy heiress, and a schemer capable of crazy impulse. She's willing to steal clothes and dinosaur bones to keep an awkward paleontologist close to her.
4. Miracle Max, played by actor Billy Crystal. "The Princess Bride" is one of the best movies you will ever watch, because its a great romance/comedy packed with memorable, unique characters. It was hard to pick one character that made the movie for me, but I decided that Miracle Max was the most unique and memorable (plus Billy Crystal is a pretty talented actor). Miracle Max is a witty and grumpy old man. He loves MLTs and can't stand the name "Humperdink".

I love Hyacinth!
I watch something called Larkrise to Candleford on PBS. All of the characters are unique and interesting. Larkrise is the poor village and Candleford is where the well off live in the late 1800's.
The story is told from the point of view from a young woman who was raised in Larkrise, and goes to live with her cousin in Candleford.
I guess the show is taken from semi autobiographical novels published in the 1940's. It's a great show with many interesting characters.
Late 1800's plus unique characters? I'm surfing through my TV guide right now...thanks for the heads up, Loree!
I've seen each and everyone of these - great picks, all characters that I've loved too. But Hyacinth...that woman cracks me up. I begrudgingly watched that show with my brother while on vacation years ago and laughed my fool head off.
oh, and Cary Grant - I have to give him a shout out. One of my favorite actors, he did so well with Katherine in Bringing up Baby.
Susan -- Hyacinth cracks me up too. Out of all of them, she's probably my favorite.
I agree that Cary Grant played a great character in "Bringing Up Baby". It was hard to pick Hepburn's character, because I loved them both! :-)
Nice to know someone else has the same issue with television. Even if I want to watch a show, I find I can't just sit there until the program ends. I walk around, go into the kitchen, pick up dog toys, etc.
I love Katy Hepburn! Her quick wit and quirkiness have stood the test of time!
Laughing at #4. I agree. Humperdink is an awful name, lol!
Brandi! *gasp* Don't tell me you've never seen "The Princess Bride"!!!! If you haven't, you must -- in fact, you have Christmas break homework: watch this incredible movie. :-)
LOLing at you picking up the dog toys while watching TV...what is it about watching TV that makes writers restless?
Great PICKS! Love all of them, but I have to agree with Susan about Cary Grant. King of the Double-Takes! Merry Christmas!
Okay, now y'all are totally snubbing Katherine, LOL! No, you're right, Marji, Cary Grant is awesome. He totally rocks the screen off a TV,(which makes "Bringing Up Baby" such a great movie -- great actors and great characters :-) Merry Christmas to you and yours! Be blessed my friend!
I'm sure it sounds awful but I still laugh when I think of the show Seinfeld. All throughout my regular, everyday life I have Seinfeld moments where I wish someone where filming so I could document the hilarity of the event!
Not at all, Shannon! Great example! Seinfeld is a hilarious show with memorable characters. I also love those moments that bridge real life with sitcom humor! If only we could capture them on video ;-)Systemwide Events Calendar

February 2011 Crab Trap Removal Marks 10th Anniversary
Decade-long Cleanup Removes 29,053 Wire Traps from Texas Bays)A federal judge upheld Louisiana's same-sex marriage ban on Wednesday, delivering a victory to traditional marriage supporters after more than two dozen losses in both federal and state courts in the past 14 months.
Gene Mills, president of Louisiana Family Forum, responded to the ruling on the organization's website, calling it a win for "the people's vote on marriage."
"It is our belief that this Louisiana legal team and their compelling argument should be the defining case that settles the question of whether a state has the right to define marriage as between one man and one woman, or whether the courts will take that right from the people," he said.
In 2004, 78 percent of Louisiana voters approved an amendment to the state constitution banning gay marriage, according to the Associated Press.
Gay rights advocates said they would appeal the case to the 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, which already has before it an appeal by the state of Texas of another federal judge's ruling that struck down that state's gay marriage ban, AP reported.
Freedom to Marry, a lead organization supporting same-sex marriage, described the ruling as a reminder that its work is far from done. In a blog about the Louisiana case, the organization's founder and president, Evan Wolfson, was quoted as saying, "We've won nearly all of the 40 state and federal marriage cases this year. This loss is why couples should not have to fight state by state, case by case, year by year. It's time for the Supreme Court to rule nationwide."
U.S. District Judge Martin Feldman upheld Louisiana's ban, as well as "the state's refusal to recognize same-sex marriages performed legally in other states," AP reported. Feldman agreed with the state's claim that the Supreme Court's Defense of Marriage Act decision in June 2013 empowered "state voters and legislatures to define marriage."
Feldman is the first federal judge to uphold a gay marriage ban since the U.S. Supreme Court last year struck down a federal ban on recognizing gay marriage, according to Reuters.
"Since the June 2013 Supreme Court ruling nearly 30 federal and state courts have ruled against bans on same-sex marriage at the state level," Reuters reported. "Nineteen U.S. states and the District of Columbia allow same-sex marriage."
While Feldman is the sole federal district judge to rule for traditional marriage, a state judge in Tennessee last month also ruled against same-sex marriage in a case that involved two gay men who were married in Iowa and sought a divorce in Tennessee. Scotus blog reported that Roane County Circuit Judge Russell E. Simmons Jr. concluded that "neither the Federal Government nor another state should be allowed to dictate to Tennessee what has been a state's responsibility," namely, defining marriage.
Feldman ruled Louisiana had "a legitimate interest in linking children with intact families formed by their biological parents, and by ensuring that fundamental social change occurs by social consensus through democratic processes." The judge was also concerned about "inconvenient questions" that have yet to be addressed by legal authorities in the midst of widespread support for same-same marriage.
"For example, must the states permit or recognize a marriage between an aunt and niece? Aunt and nephew? Brother/brother? Father and child? May minors marry? Must marriage be limited to only two people? What about a transgender spouse? Is such a union same-gender or male-female?" he wrote. "All such unions would undeniably be equally committed to love and caring for one another, just like the plaintiffs."
Feldman discussed his departure from the recent trend in rulings at several points within his opinion, The Huffington Post reported.
."
Feldman's nod to the Supreme Court's eventual involvement calls attention to a shared sense in the legal community that the same-sex marriage debate will not be resolved unless the Supreme Court takes up one of the many appeals on its doorstep from lower courts.
"Three cases already are pending at the court that the justices can choose from, involving fights over the bans in Virginia, Utah and Oklahoma. Whichever one they choose would likely be the most momentous civil rights case in years," Reuters reported.
Feldman explained in his opinion that the Supreme Court or 5th Circuit Court would need to define gay people "as a protected class in discrimination cases" before he could feel comfortable overturning a ban, the AP reported.
"In light of still-binding precedent, this Court declines to fashion a new suspect class," Feldman wrote. "To do so would distort precedent and demean the democratic process."But, back to my ditsy-ness. I made this 'cheesecake', which is a frozen pie, and somehow missed the part about it needing to freeze. I left it in the refrigerator overnight and was insanely perplexed as to why it was STILL incredibly runny the next day. Cursing the directions for not telling me to freeze the pie, I served it anyway. What a drippy mess. Only then, did I realized it was probably supposed to be frozen. So, I stuck it in the freezer, a couple slices missing, and sure enough, it hardened up nicely.
Luckily, even as runny goop, it tasted great. If you like coffee and chocolate, you're going to really, really like this pie. Just don't forget to freeze it.

Sunday, 01 March 2015
With the release of the NAWAC's Ouachita Project Monograph, we thought it might be good to revisit the 1997 Six Rivers Expedition field report from Greenwell and Meldrum. We originally included this report on our website in 2007 and it seemed now was a good time to bring attention to it again. Greenwell's team was in the field for three weeks and made some observations and recovered some evidence that would later share commonality with the observations and evidence years later of the NAWAC in the Ouachita Mountain Ecoregion. Greenwell's team may have made many more observations and recovered key evidence had they remained onsite for 60-120 days. It's a brief but nonetheless relevant report. - Daryl ColyerHello and Welcome to my Blog! I’m Yvonne Richards and I am a Spiritual Development Coach.

Jessie Steinberg, 28, filed a police report against Thurman, 58, following an encounter at Pazzo Pazzo on Wednesday, saying he slapped her after she rebuffed his advances. Police said on Friday Thurman was not charged with a crime.
One witness claims Thurmnan never did such a thing.
Tim Dolan, 43, of Bloomfield, NJ, told The Post he was sitting with two friends at a nearby table and did not witness any unnecessary roughness.
“I am a lifelong Giants fan, but am speaking out because this accuser is wrong,” Dolan said.

“The woman’s friend then asked us, ‘Did you see him slap her in the face?’ If I had seen something I would have said or done something, but he didn’t hit her.”On this week's episode of the ABC comedy SUBURGATORY titled 'Friendship Fish,' Malik leaves Lisa for two days, so she decides to spend every minute with Tessa.

My favorite part of this opening set was the cover of Robyn’s song “Dancing On My Own”, which to my surprise no one in the audience seemed to know. Carousel, I promise Atlanta has decent taste in music!
A Silent Film took the stage shortly after, and all I can say is this band needs to be owning a bigger stage with their incredible energy and powerful sound. Perhaps, Center Stage next? Slender men dressed in skinny jeans and button downs with their UK accents to match, I was in heaven. Opening with “Reaching the Potential” from their newest album Sand & Snow, you couldn’t help but dance, sing along, and have a smile on your face. Lead singer Robert Stevenson’s energy was incredibly infectious. He was practically in the crowd singing and has that amazing power to make it seem like he is only singing to you (a gal can dream right?) Their sound reminded me of an 80’s Coldplay. A highlight for me was their adrenaline pumping tune, “Driven By A Beating Heart” which you could picture playing during the climax of any primetime TV drama. Other memorable moments from this uplifting show included, “Thousand Mile Race” and current hit “Danny, Dakota, & the Wishing Well”. You certainly didn’t feel like it was a cold rainy Wednesday night after this captivating show. Sand & Snow is available now.

Make!The injured firefighter, whom the Menlo Park Fire Protection District did not identify, spent a night in Stanford Hospital for observation and is expected to fully recover from the first- and second-degree burns to his hands, Fire Chief Harold Schapelhouman said in a statement.
That the firefighter was wearing protective gloves at the time the fire flashed over and caused his injuries is significant and will be investigated, the chief said. The district had checked recently to ensure that the firefighters weren't using gloves a manufacturer had recently recalled.
"Any time we have one of our personnel injured we take that very, very seriously and conduct a comprehensive post-incident review of the emergency," Chief Schapelhouman said in the statement. "While what happened is certainly unfortunate, I'm glad that it wasn't worse, given the difficult conditions that firefighters can face on the fire ground when they are combating an active fire. We got lucky on this one."
Firefighters responded to a 6:44 p.m. phone call from a neighbor reporting gray smoke coming from the roof of the house at 1058 Oakland Ave., the chief said. One company of firefighters arrived four minutes later; that number grew to about 20, including two battalion chiefs to manage the incident, the chief said.
By 7:15 p.m., the fire was under control, but did $400,000 in damage to the structure and $100,000 to the contents, the chief said. Five renting tenants lived in the 2,000-square-foot home but have been displaced, as the house is not safe for occupation.
This was not a simple fire to extinguish, and several holes had to be cut into the roof, the chief said. Complicating factors included super-heated gases and smoke, an enclosed and elevated area where the fire might be when trying to fight it from the inside, and not knowing exactly where the flames were, the chief said.
"... Extinguishment was difficult and took more time and much more effort by crews working the fire," he said.
Prior to his injury, the firefighter, who was wearing his mask and other safety equipment, had left the roof to get a fresh chain saw. He resumed his work but had forgotten to reattach the air-regulator to his mask "when the fire ball swept over him," the chief said.
The flames burned through his gloves, but he came through with his respiratory tract only irritated — a "miraculous" outcome, the chief said. When the flames leapt up, the firefighter had the presence of mind to hold his breath and back away as fellow firefighters pulled him away from the ventilation hole.
The fireball having subsided, the injured firefighter went on to finish his assignment before leaving the roof, Chief Schapelhouman said.Sorry!

‘It is advised not to increase your mileage for these runs by more than ten per cent each week and to vary the surfaces you run on. Also, rest and recovery are essential but often overlooked. You should be aiming for two days’ rest after your long run. This rest period can be replaced with cross-training if it is low impact, which avoids any overuse injuries.’
Kathryn Freeland
‘Anyone preparing for April will now be kicking up the weekly mileage,’ says personal trainer Kathryn Freeland ( fitness.co.uk). ‘This is necessary to get the cardiovascular system used to the marathon distance and to get the leg muscles strong enough to withstand the repetitive pounding. Remember to keep working on the stomach muscles as well. Exercises for transverse abdominus, obliques and lower back provide core strength. Exercises such as the plank and side plank are essential.’
Freeland advises including speed sessions in your training. ‘Do one speed session a week where you are running at 80 to 100 per cent effort and then a good speed endurance session where you run 300m at 80 to 100 per cent effort. Do this six times with a three-minute rest in between. These sessions will help increase fast-twitch fibres in your leg muscles, which can also be activated in a marathon.’
Nicki Waterman
‘Running hills is one of the most basic and beneficial sessions for marathon training,’ says fitness expert Nicki Waterman. ‘But it’s hard on your body, so don’t do more than one per week. Warm up with a 10-14minute run and then do a set of intervals on a steep slope – anywhere from 30 to 250m long. Run at an intensity that is slightly harder than your best 5K race pace. Jog back to the bottom and, when you’ve recovered, run up again. Start with four or five intervals and gradually build up. Hill runs will boost leg-muscle power, giving you quicker, longer strides.’Capital Markets

Desperated need some advice
Hello everybody :)
Thanks for the warm welcome on this forum.
I'm training for almost 2 years now.
And i made some progress (little) but not enough.
That has more then 1 reason.
My diet was not good enough,
I was continu switching from routine to another routine and so one and one.
The more i was searching on the internet,the more i swichted from routines.
Now i have done some good research about food first,and now i understand that part of training.
But now i have some trouble with finding a good,basic routine to get me strong and big.
There are maybe a 1000 different routines on the internet,and now i don't know anymore wich one to pick,and to follow that routine.
Can somebody please help me in the right direction???
My goals are:
Being bigger and strong.
I don't want to be big without being strong :)
Now i have read al the articles and routines on this main page for probely 10 times or more.
And i don't know where to start now :confused:
The gym where i'm training now has all the barbell's and stuff to get the job done.
So that's no problem at all.
I can train 3 days,monday,wednesday and the friday.
Optinal is the sunday for a fourth day.
*Sorry if there are some spelling errors

Check out the MAB Classic Challenge. If that is not your desire, I would recommend a basic 5 x 5 routine. Work on form and be patient. Learn the exercises, build your strength, the big will come.... in time.

MAB Classic Challenge will be a great starting point because there is already a group of guys who are doing it and there a also many who will be help you out if you have any questions about the program.

Welcome to the forum/site.
Congrats on researching food first. Its very important for making gains.
Don't over think it or get fancy. Keeping it simple you can consentrate on details better. Like form, nutrition, timing. Plus you get to fancy starting out you can't pin piont what works and what doesn't for your body.
Before getting to deep into this, how fast your body recovers is the big thing.
If you recover fast a full body 3 days a week would work.
BUT if your body don't heal/recover quickly, then you may have to do compound large muscle group once a week with a small muscle group isalates with each work out.
How fast do you recover?

Well, I won't quite say it doesn't matter what routine you use but I would say that consistency with whatever you pick is more important. I'm guilty of switching routines too frequently as well, but I still make gains because I always work out at least 4 days a week, and it always includes squat, deadlift, bench press, and overhead press. The other question I would ask you is whether you prefer full-body or a split? I did the full body
York Barbell and Dumbbell Training System - Muscle and Brawn - Bodybuilding and Powerlifting
and it was great, I had less success using
You Asked for It, and You've Got It- Exercises in Extremity, the 1st Official C&P Workout Template | Chaos and Pain
full body, had some great gains with an upper-lower split, and right now I am using and loving a variation on
Bill Kazmaier Training Routine | Muscle and Brawn Bodybuilding, Powerlifting and Muscle Building.
which I expect to stick to for the foreseeable future. I hope that helps at least a little bit.

Seppe,
Welcome aboard! There are many roads to being and looking strong. You will get some different answers even from those of us on this forum. That doesn't mean we disagree, but that we've each found our own way. Fortunately, we're all very happy to share with you what we have learned and maybe let you take that knowledge and forge your own way.
My first suggestion is to find something basic and stick to it for a while. Two weeks is not enough. Two months is better, but still not enough. After three months or more you should be able to make a fair judgement if a particular template or program is working. My standard suggestions would be one of these options:
StrongLifts 5x5: The Ultimate Strength and Muscle Program | StrongLifts.com
or
Bill Starr (MadCow) 5×5 Intermediate Routine
they are both well structured and fairly easy to follow after the first couple of weeks. They both focus on building a strong foundation on the major compound lifts. You will find that focusing on the big lifts will indeed benefit you the most especially from the very beginning, because these compound exercises call upon all of the muscles in your body to work together in concert. Your body will grow as a unit, and you WILL look and feel strong and powerful if you apply yourself to smart and dedicated training, a bountiful and balanced diet, and plenty of sleep.
Again, those are
MY
suggestions. Others on this board may tell you differently. My very good friend, glwanabe, is an advocate of fullbody routines. I'm sure he will see this thread and chime in with his opinion. You would do well to consider all he has to say. He's quite a bit older than me, and also slightly wiser. Regardless of the differing opinions, we all want to see you succeed.
I wish you well.

@Trevor lane:
I tried the typical splits,like:
Monday: Chest and triceps
Wednesday : Back and biceps
Friday : Legs and shoulders
And i was continuous switching exercises the more i read on the net.

Theres two rules you have to stick to 100% to be successfull imo:
1, Do Squat, bench, deadlift and ohpress. This should be the fundament of your training program.
2, Always strive for progression! Lift heavy!
BendtheBar

Hi Seppe.
The first thing you need to focus on is
exercise selection
. Routines aren't as important as using the proper lifts. You want to focus on mostly basic, compound lifts for a long time. Only add lifts for a reason. Evolve your training based on what you learn, and your individual needs. And only when you are confident you know how to add muscle.
Once you are in a groove building muscle, and your eating plan is spot on, then you can worry about tinkering with your exercises and workouts.
Second, understand that routines aren't magic, but
progression of weight
is. Progression is this...using good form, push yourself on every set. When you can reach the "rep goal" for that set, add weight the next time in the gym. This is how a beginner to intermediate will maximize gains. Start with a simple workout. Complexity is overrated, but hard work yields gains.
Third,
diet
is a huge part of the equation. Eat about 30 to 35 grams of protein very 2.5 to 3 hours. You also want to eat enough calories so that you are gaining about 1-2 pounds per month your first year of training. If you are young you may need to start eating at 3000 to 3500 calories per day. If you are 35+ you may need to be at 2500 to 3000 to gain muscle.
Pick a number and watch the scale. If you're not gaining weight, add 300 more daily calories. Continue this pattern until you are adding your goal weight each month.
Outside of protein, make sure you eat some healthy complex carb sources such as oatmeal, rice, and potatoes. You also want veggies and fruit of course.
Workouts
Stick with a 3 or 4 day training approach. A 3 day can be a fullbody workout, or a split like:
Day 1 - Chest, shoulders and triceps
Day 2 - OFF
Day 3 - Legs
Day 4 - OFF
Day 5 - Back, biceps and Abs
Day 6 - OFF
Day 7 - Repeat or OFF
A 4 day split:
Day 1 - Chest and biceps
Day 2 - Legs
Day 3 - OFF
Day 4 - Shoulders and triceps
Day 5 - Back, traps and Abs
Day 6 - OFF
Day 7 - Repeat or OFF
Remember
Fancy, complex workouts might be needed by advanced lifters, but simplicity and hard work yield results.
Exercises
Stick with exercises like:
Squats, Romanian deadlifts, calf raises, bench press, dumbbell bench press, dips, overhead dumbbell or barbell press, upright rows, barbell and dumbbbell rows, deadlifts, pullups, barbell and dumbbell curls, barbell shrugs, closegrip bench press.

Family and I (and a couple of extras) are heading for the beach. To do nothing at all. A quiet beach hopefully, one we haven't been to before. This year so many of us are having to plan our beach days around that dreaded oil. So sad, all of it.
And so, as I try to do each year around this time, I will leave you with a few posts including some photographs that are my own. And some words that are not.
These first words special, because they come from a man who delivered his most famous speech a couple of days before I was born. Special words from a man who 'was the change he wanted to see' in the world. I still cry when I read that speech.
"Justice at its best is love correcting everything that stands against love." { martin luther king jr }
Oh may I always choose to stand on the side of love...!

Alternative BritDave asked my opinion on Giambi. What he’s saying is accurate and needed to be said, and said by a high profile player. Then again, it was easy for him to make those comments because his usage was already known.
To many high profile players don’t want to get involved. I once asked Derek Jeter his thoughts and he said since he didn’t take them that it wasn’t for him to say. Wrong. It’s your sport and you should care.
But, that’s Jeter and he’s not one to get his hands dirty.
For all things Yankees, “check out the Yankees blog by my colleague Peter Abraham”:
5 Comments
Hi John –
I remember you mentioning Jeter’s remark about steroids, once before, and he said very much the same thing to someone who asked him about Giambi recently. It makes me see Jeter a bit differently, particularly since his own father – who helps manage his Turn Two Foundation- has a PhD in drug and alcohol counselling.
Jeter should take advantage of the reputation he has and the platform he gets as Yankee Captain to be much more of a spokesman about the dangers of these illegal drugs particularly to kids and their health. Here in Connecticut there have been some terrible stories about kids, coaches and steroids being used for High School Sports.
Professional athletes using drugs is one thing, kids stealing money from their parents to go to Mexico and buy steroids for high school sports is another. It’s all illegal, but more lethal for the youngsters.
Ordinarily I’d agree with you both because as a Mets fan there’s no one I like to criticize more than Jeter. However, with the Yankees in a state of disrepair, the less people that open their mouths in their clubhouse, the better. Jeter is being a captain in trying to get a less than formidable squad back on track by focusing on the games. No need to give the media any more fire for the back pages.
OK Matt – that’s a point well taken.
oh my, a member of the media criticizing derek jeter? How dare you!! i am reporting this blog to espn right now.
John,
I agree with you on both points. Jason is opening a can of worms MLB wishes would just go away. Selig was dragged by congress into confronting this thing but never really fully addressed the issue.
Jeter is being diplomatic. He does not want to get dragged into a war he cannot win. The right thing to do would damage his image.
DaveChris Dorner and the Star Trek Solution to Illegal Executions

What would Captain Kirk do if ordered to fire burners into the cabin supposedly occupied by Chris Dorner?

On February 24, 2013, the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences has thrown down the Gauntlet to Congress, the President, the corporate oil vultures and the Military Industrial Complex by presenting the Best Picture Award to Argo, a movie showing that peace is the way to save lives in response to an act of war.
On November 4, 1979, Iranian students stormed the American Embassy in Tehran and took Americans hostage. This was a violation of U.S. Sovereignty. America was attacked where it was supposed to be secure under international law. But Jimmy Carter refused to take up the sword. Instead, he took up the dove and got everyone home, alive and safe.
The takeover of the American Embassy was effectively an act of war – unlike any current actions of Iran involving the United States or its citizens. Iran has not taken over any of our embassies since 1979. It has committed no acts of war against the United States. Its peaceful nuclear energy plan (albeit an unhealthy and unsafe energy plan) is peaceful. In fact, if asked their opinion, most Americans living near nuclear power plants would gladly encourage the U.S Government to dig up and ship all 104 of our operational nuclear reactors to Iran as a belated Christmas present. I live near San Onofre Nuclear Generating Station (SONGS) and Californians have been trying to get rid of that plant for decades as it is the most unsafe reactor in America.
In 2013, Congress has been besieged with lies about Iran by hawks, eager to attack the country with the fourth largest oil reserves in the world, after “Venezuela, Saudi Arabia and Canada.” Congressional warmongers are eager for war.
In the face of all this genocidal drive towards another future wasteland of dead babies and innocent civilians as a ritual sacrifice to the U.S. Military Industrial Complex, the Motion Picture Academy of Arts and Sciences has boldly stood up and reminded the blood-thirsty Congressional and Executive Branch hawks of the success of Jimmy Carter’s path towards peace.
As shown in Argo, while peace saved lives in 1979 and 1980, it did not save Jimmy Carter’s Presidency. Heroically, he put the lives of others before his own career. He could have taken credit for the rescue of six American from the Canadian Ambassador’s home instead of letting the Canadians have the credit. However, that would have risked Canadian lives in Iran. Carter was not about to risk lives to save his Presidency.
Also clear from the movie was the attempted undermining of Carter’s peace plan by a shadow government with ties to the Pentagon. Movie goers see that Tony Mendez, the CIA rescuer who conceived and carried out the plan for the Argo rescue, actually had to go against CIA superiors in order for the plan to succeed. If he had listened to his CIA bosses, the six Americans would have been captured and they and the Canadian diplomats could have been killed. This betrayal by the intelligence community is no surprise as a helicopter rescue plan was sabotaged by people in the Military Industrial Complex working against Carter and the hostages. The helicopter rescue idea was ridiculous, given the terrain and weather conditions in Iran. The military advisors had to know the helicopter plan would fail and embarrass the President even as they were working to sell the plan as a likely success scenario. Going against his bosses, Argo’s Mendez proved that he was one CIA officer who cared more about saving lives than about bringing down a President.

The Twilight Saga: Breaking Dawn-Part 2 should be required viewing for all government officials, particularly Barack Obama and Benjamin Netanyahu.
It establishes that the only way to win a war is not to fight it in the first place. Even the winners lose when wars are fought.
This concluding chapter of the Twilight Saga may remind some of Mathew Broderick’s 1983 movie, Wargames. Who could forget the NORAD computer running through all possible scenarios of the game of “Global Thermalnuclear War” with the Soviet Union and then announcing that, ” the only winning move is NOT TO PLAY?” This movie teaches a similar lesson.
In Iraq and Afghanistan, millions have died. The soldiers massacred are far fewer than the numbers of innocent civilians (especially little children) slaughtered, but there was no need for our servicemen to die and even less reason for innocent civilians to die. What gives us the right to go into somebody else’s country and murder their children?
Yet, in addition to Iraq and Afghanistan, we have slaughtered innocents in Libya and Pakistan and now some Americans want to slaughter more in Iran.
The same could be said for Netanyahu and his slaughter of innocent children in Gaza. In preparation for an election, he slaughtered children and babies in Palestine. These innocents never did anything to him. Bibi’s behavior is reminiscent of that of the Twilight’s Vulturi family who have already killed too many innocent children and are willing to do lots of collateral damage, just to murder one more.
Breaking Dawn-Part 2 should be shown on the floor of Congress before the next vote for even one more dollar of war funding or before sending one more weapon to Israel. It should also be viewed at the ICC as Netanyahu is being brought in handcuffs before that tribunal for his crimes against humanity.
Even the bad leaders in Twilight had higher morals than the leaders of the United States and Israel. In the movie, the leadership of both sides of the conflict was on the front lines of the battle and willing to lose their heads (literally) for their respective causes. Why are Obama and Bibi sending others to do their dirty work while they hide far away from the massacres? Are they cowards? Shouldn’t all of Congress be out on the plains of Afghanistan and other battlefields, engaging in hand to hand combat with whomever they want to kill. That would be the honorable thing. Maybe we should enact a Constitutional Amendment requiring our leaders to be the first ones to line up on the battlefields when they vote for war. That instantly gives us up to 535 willing and eager troops in addition to the President and his/her cabinet, who must also be eager and willing or they’d decide against war before it started.
Chris Hedges has stated, “Elites Will Make Gazans of Us All.” As the people of the world joined in spirit to oppose and boycott Israel over the last week, Twilight’s Vulturi family found that the best of their kind were gathered to oppose their terror and oppression. In Twilight, lifelong enemies from different families/cultures/breeds/species(?) choose to put aside their differences and unite to save a child and bring about peace. Imagine what would have happened if the leaders of the United States had gone to Israel and demanded an end to the slaughter before the first Palestinian child died in the recent conflict.
Twilight teaches some other important principles lacking in our society. The main characters are constantly willing to sacrifice and put their lives on the line for their family and friends. The series teaches that true love is about being willing to give up what you want most to protect those you love. American society has become very selfish. Divorces are at an all- time high and the once-strong family structure support system is broken. A return to the values demonstrated in Twilight could both save the economy and increase longevity in the United States.
In addition to being the best anti-war picture of 2012 and a movie that teaches about values, this final chapter is also full of action that will keep audiences eagerly entranced and watching the screen. In theaters, the audiences are so enthralled that you can listen to the vocal manifestations of the alignment of their hearts and minds with each new development in the plot.
There are also surprises and twists that actually improve the story for those who have read and loved the book series. It is loaded with action and suspense. The actors and actresses turn in award-quality performances in this segment. Lovers of the series will be glad they caught this movie and will find the final outcome to their liking. Most audience-goers are saying this is the best of the Twilight films. So if you haven’t caught the other four, at least watch this one.
Of all the films this holiday season, Breaking Dawn-Part 2 is the one you will be most glad you saw. It will leave you with a good sense of what life, love and peace are all about. If everyone got the messages in this film, we just might end these wars and save America’s economy..
Spielberg’s Lincoln and the Resilience of Historic Myths
By Ruth Hull
Think about the word “history” — his story. History is always told by the victors. Victors have the money and power to acquire spin doctors to come up with created history so these winners will sound so good that they are unrecognizable.
Some popular myths (as in not true):
Some even cooler myths that I had never heard can be found at: Debunked Myths about the U.S. Presidents.
With Thanksgiving approaching, some people want to re-create the early days of the early settlers.
Remember Plymouth, a place where the Pilgrims did not land on a rock. There is a commemorative rock there now. Jamestown was founded first.
In Jamestown, one of the more interesting dishes was human beings. Yes, check out Howard Zinn’s “People’s History of the United States.” Many of us were descended from cannibals. Now, while known cannibals like the Jamestown settlers were white, there are no documented instances of non-white cannibalistic societies. Such non-white societies are myths. So maybe a white Thanksgiving isn’t a good idea if you want to keep your body parts.
If you wish to eat like the Pilgrims, make sure you use your fingers. Howard Zinn calls Thanksgiving, “the celebration of the friendly dinner that came before the genocide.” So, in keeping with tradition, have dinner with your neighbors and then slaughter them.
The Lincoln movie by Spielberg also played into historical myths. Sometimes myths are fun. In the case of Lincoln, they were very entertaining. It’s easy to get lost in these myths and some believers are willing to fight against anyone trying to provide them with facts. Though Lincoln scared the South into seceding, he was at best a reluctant abolitionist, preferring an intact Union to freeing even one slave. Occasionally, he would say something to appease abolitionists and then go back to statements expressing his belief in inequality of the races. His letter to Horace Greeley is consistent with this as were his statements in the Lincoln-Douglas debates and the Emancipation Proclamation, which could have freed slaves in the Union territories but specifically did not free even one slave in the Union. The Proclamation was designed to demoralize the South, against which the Union was fighting while giving the appearance that it actually stood for something. Lincoln opposed interracial marriage. He spoke of deporting the Blacks to Africa and he supported fugitive slave laws. An African-American scholar named Leone Bennett, Jr., wrote a book in 2007 calling Lincoln a racist and documenting his claims directly from Lincoln’s speeches. Mr. Bennett ignored the myth-writers and therefore stirred up a lot of anger among whites who insisted their white President freed the slaves single-handedly. The book is called, “Forced into Glory: Abraham Lincoln’s White Dream.” Regardless of your feelings about Mr. Bennett, Lincoln’s own words in the Lincoln-Douglas debates and elsewhere show he did not consider himself an abolitionist. While we may wish Lincoln had been a stronger opponent of slavery, we are stuck with the facts as they were. It is hard to think our leaders were so ignorant that they didn’t get that even debating before ending slavery was itself an abomination.
In the Lincoln-Douglas Debates, this is one of the most repeated of Lincoln’s statements. Here in the sixth debate, he is quoting his anti-abolitionist position to prove his consistency on this point.
“After reading I added these words: ‘Now,.'” (source)
The Lincoln movie does have a certain amount of charm. The favorite part for Israel’s Likud Party is undoubtedly towards the end. Why would an 1865 Abraham Lincoln be reminiscing about wanting to take off to Israel? The Israeli plug was silly at best. Robert Lincoln refuted the false historical claim that his father was Jewish. The timing of the movie’s opening to coincide with the attack on Gaza was likely something Spielberg didn’t expect, but those in the Israeli leadership, who met with Spielberg, before the filming started, did have choices and they chose to massacre children on the opening weekend.
The movie also diminished the contributions of African-Americans and women in getting the 13th Amendment adopted, making it look as if the Amendment was a gratuity granted to them. In Lincoln, the physical handing of the 13th Amendment document to the African-American love interest of Thaddeus Stevens symbolizes the idea that it was a gift handed down from the Whites as opposed to something the Blacks inherently deserved.
Embellishing to build up our leaders as role models is sometimes considered useful, but not when the admission of teens to college depends on their getting 5’s on their Advanced Placement U.S. History exams. Fortunately for this year’s AP students, there is half a year to dispel the myths of this movie and get top scores. The best prep for that particular AP exam is Howard Zinn’s People’s History of the United States.
Now, while the Spielberg movie mixed myths with history, it left out Lincoln’s opposition to corporate rule and also the special holiday he gave America: Thanksgiving.
Lincoln was theoretically (though this could be another myth) inspired by editorials and letters written by Sarah Josepha Hale, the New England editor of Godey’s Book, to create the occasion. In 1863, after the Battle of Gettysburg, he declared the National Thanksgiving Holiday.
So have a Happy Thanksgiving. If you want to see a movie over the holiday weekend, a good choice is the final chapter in the Twilight series. Breaking Dawn, Part 2, may well turn out to be the best anti-war movie of the year. See it and you will find out why..Description

The Chief of Army Staff had alleged that the General Isa had all the information about the attacks, but refused to act until the attacks were successfully executed.
The Army General who was forcefully retired from active service denied the allegation that he had prior knowledge of the bomb blast.
According to the ex-commander who spoke through his lawyer, Mr. Yahaya Mahmood (SAN) said, he had written several letters and complaints on security challenges at Jaji.
Mahmood, in a letter addressed to editors of four national dailies including LEADERSHIP, said that his client had written to Army Headquarters complaining that the Barrack was not fenced and that there were civilians living within it.
"When our client wrote to the army headquarters requesting for Money to construct 25 watch towers and perimeters fence, he was directed to refer the request to HQ 41 DE and NAE which he did," he added.
The retired General also denied knowledge of those responsible for the media campaign against perceived discrepancies in the recruitments, promotions, postings and retirements in the Army.
In relation to the bomb blast and the commander's compulsory retirement, he narrated that "on Sunday, November 25, 2012 he left for Asaba for Chief of Army Staff Conference in company of a co-commandant in Jaji, AVM Umaru (rtd) and as they were approaching Okene, he received a call that there was bomb blast in Jaji."
"As I arrived Asaba I briefed the Chief of Army Staff, took permission and returned to Jaji. On November 27, 2012, I issued a Convening Order, constituting a board of inquiry, to investigate and determine the circumstances that led to the bomb blast. On the same date, the COAS also constituted a board of inquiry.
"On November 30, 2012, an Order was issued to me that I should hand over by 8: 50 pm the following day, which I did. On the December 14, I was asked to forward my notification of retirement or face compulsory retirement," he narrated.Popular Searches

The mega-jam started as a result of road damage caused by a truck on a newly constructed portion of road and has been exacerbated by heavy use from truckers hauling goods into the capital city plus various accidents. This is the second such mega-jam this summer and the underlying problem is China's growing love affair with automotive transport.
Whether it be the ubiquitous small trucks piled almost to tipping with various goods or the car showrooms sprouting like mushrooms after a rain in all the major and minor cities of the People's Republic, the Chinese want to drive. More than 2,000 new cars are added to Beijing's streets every day. That Chinese desire to drive could prove a problem for the entire planet.
That's because transportation such as cars make up the fastest growing source of emissions of CO2 and other greenhouse gases. Those gases wrap the Earth in a heat-trapping blanket, ultimately changing weather patterns. And we all know what weird weather does to traffic.
What's worse, the world's worst traffic jam may have been caused by the world's other worst offender when it comes to climate change: coal. Specifically, trucks carrying illegally mined coal to the capital. If both these trends keep up, climate change is a foregone conclusion.

Simplifile’s growth this year strongly shows that eRecording is no longer a new concept, but rather something that counties are actively pursuing.
“When new counties begin eRecording today, they are no longer diving into uncharted waters,” said Paul Clifford, president of Simplifile. “eRecording, without question, has become a mainstream service adopted by recording jurisdictions throughout the U.S. and has been proven to securely enhance the entire recording process.”
eRecording has introduced dramatic improvements to the recording process throughout the U.S., enabling organizations such as title companies, law firms, and banks to electronically submit land documents to county offices in a more cost-effective, time-efficient manner, according to Simplifile.
“Not only do we have 800 counties now e-recording with Simplifile in 40 states, but we also have more than 6,000 companies across the nation who entrust us to securely submit their documents to and from those counties,” Clifford said.
The rate of growth in adoption of eRecording throughout the country continues to increase as both submitters and recording jurisdictions embrace this technology.
“Morton County was happy to partner with Simplifile to offer our constituents an e-recording service,” said Sally Akers, the Morton County register of deeds. “This will not only speed up real estate transactions but also streamline oil and gas transactions in our county.”Don't bail out out our state!
The Commonwealth Foundation has joined with 58 other groups (led by the NTU) sending a letter to Congress on why a bailout of state and local governments is a bad idea, and only encourage more misspending of taxpayers' dollars. The full letter is below, or click here. For more on why federal bailout of states are a bad idea, check out South Carolina Governor Mark Sanford's testimony to Congress or op-ed in the Wall Street Journal
NTU's Andrew Moylan also has a roundup of bailout-related links - beginning with a clip comparing the bailout to a Family Guy joke that isn't funny, except that it goes on too long - including a new site, BailoutSleuth which has been tracking where the $700 billion is going and all those sorts of minor details.
One recent applicant for the bailout money is Americans for Tax Reform head Grover Norquist - who applied for the full $700 billion. He wants to use to to cut the corporate income tax from 35% to 15%; cut the top individual income tax rate from 35% to 15%; eliminate the death, capital gains, and dividend taxes; and allow companies to fully-expense capital assets purchased the first year. If that last one doesn't seem nearly as sexy as the others recall - it takes that many tax cuts to equal $700 billion. No chance he gets the money of course, it makes too much sense.

My thought is if the Federal Government provides tax dollars to bailout cities or states, I should be able to vote in those cities or states. Otherwise, it is taxation without representation.Here's some bad news for anyone who is hopeful that five Ohio State football players will get their five-game NCAA suspensions reduced on appeal:
Based on recent precedent, and given the criticism the NCAA has received recently for several of its decisions, a reduction is far from a given, and may be termed unlikely.
Ohio State is expected to soon have its day in court, so to speak, when the NCAA's Committee on Student-Athlete Reinstatement has a conference call with Ohio State officials and the five players.
On Dec.22, the NCAA announced the suspensions of offensive tackle Mike Adams, running back Daniel Herron, receiver DeVier Posey, quarterback Terrelle Pryor and defensive end Solomon Thomas for selling memorabilia and accepting discounts on tattoos, a violation of the NCAA extra benefits rule.
A sixth player, linebacker Jordan Whiting, received a one-game suspension for accepting a discount and is not involved in the appeal.
The appeal is basically a rehash of the same information that Ohio State presented to the NCAA in December. According to the NCAA, no new information is allowed to be presented at the appeal.
The difference is that the committee is not the same body that initially ruled the players ineligible - that group was made up of full-time NCAA staffers, while the committee is composed of various school or conference officials.
The players must all be involved in the conference call. The NCAA will present its original reasons for the suspension, followed by time for Ohio State officials and players to make their case, and then time for the committee to ask questions.
All parties then are allowed to make final arguments.
One factor working against Ohio State is that in each of the three other football appeals to the committee in the 2010 season, the NCAA rejected the appeal.
A look:
• Sept.17: Georgia receiver A.J. Green's appeal of a four-game suspension was rejected. Green sold one of his game-worn jerseys for $1,000 to a man later determined to be a runner for a sports agent. Green claimed he was not aware of that connection.
After the hearing, Georgia president Michael Adams told reporters, "There's just not much that somebody in a position like mine can do on something like this. You can spend the money, you can get the best counsel and get the best advice you can get and make the appeal. I will say I think the university did everything to help (Green) that the university could."
• Sept.23: The NCAA upheld a four-game suspension for Middle Tennessee State quarterback Dwight Dasher, who had been given an impermissible loan of $1,500 from a community member.
• Oct.1: The NCAA upheld the suspensions of two North Carolina players, safety Deunta Williams (four games) and cornerback Kendric Burney (six games) for receiving improper benefits such as free travel and expenses.
Ohio State has said it will have no comment on the appeal until the process is complete.
One former NCAA official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, calls the appeal a long shot.
"It seems like right now the committee is pretty much sticking (to the suspensions)," the former official said. "There doesn't seem to be a lot of deviation."
He also said the NCAA might be affected by the storm of criticism it received for its decision on Auburn quarterback Cam Newton - who was suspended and immediately reinstated - and for allowing the suspended Ohio State players to play in the Sugar Bowl.

• IA-04: Democrat Jim Mowrer is one of the few challengers to hold more cash on hand than the person he's trying to unseat. Mowrer, who is taking on unhinged Republican Rep. Steve King, is taking advantage of his financial edge to air his third spot of the cycle. Mowrer describes how he lost his father at a young age, and the family only survived because of Social Security. Mowrer then declares he'll defend Social Security.
While Mowrer has the privilege of running against one of the nuttiest members of Congress, his spots have been all positive so far. Mowrer has heavily played up his local roots and his military service in his first and second spots. So far, King and his allies have not been on the air at all. Romney won this seat 53-45, and King turned back a well-funded challenge last cycle by a similar margin. King may feel he has nothing to worry about: We'll see if Mowrer's spots make him feel any differently.

Gubernatorial:
• AZ-Gov: With the Aug. 26 Republican primary almost here, former Mesa Mayor Scott Smith has two last minute positive ads (here and here). We also have a very rare sighting: An ad for Secretary of State Ken Bennett. Bennett has long been an afterthought in this contest, with his opponents and their allies not even bothering to attack him. Bennett's own ad is pretty dull, with him just talking to the camera.
• FL-Gov: Next Gen Climate ties Republican Gov. Rick Scott to big polluters. In what's become a big theme in anti-Scott ads, the spot throws in a clip of Scott evading questions at a hearing over his then-company's alleged Medicare fraud.

TSN has set the stage for a fun filled evening in Springhill, open to everyone, beginning with a free barbecue at 5 p.m.
A spinoff from being one of the communities chosen in the Kraft Celebration Tour to receive $25,000 to upgrade its park and vying for another $75,000, TSN rolled into the community Monday to start preparing for the 7 p.m. airing of Sprotscentre from the Lions Park.
Filming, however, began yesterday and will continue today for highlights of Springhill and its people during the live broadcast. All the while, the community has been showing its spirit with businesses painting their storefronts and the youth getting involved in a poster contest at the teen centre. Volunteers met inside the CIBC Common Room to address last minute preparations.
The fun begins at the Lions Park at 5 p.m. with a free barbecue, Kraft product "activations," entertainment, roller derby, baseball, games and much more.MINNEAPOLIS (AP) -- Allen Iverson broke into song, Linas Kleiza joked with Anthony Carter, and two other players were discussing underwear styles.
Yes, the Denver locker room was a happy place on Friday night. And it might stay that way for a while if the Nuggets keep playing like this.
Iverson scored 33 points, Carmelo Anthony added 26 and the Nuggets beat the Minnesota Timberwolves 118-107.
The Nuggets showed little hangover affect from Thursday night's victory over the defending champion San Antonio Spurs. Denver led 12-0 before the game was three minutes old and took a 61-52 lead into halftime.
"The season has games you're supposed to win and should win and all that stuff," Nuggets coach George Karl said. "But what it comes down to is they're all difficult. I think this was a very good win for us."
Minnesota has lost a season-worst seven straight and is off to the worst start in franchise history at 4-28. Reserve Rashad McCants led the Timberwolves with a career-high 34 points, and Al Jefferson had 24 points and 15 rebounds.
"We played hard but we just gave up too many easy points," Wolves guard Marko Jaric said. "Fast breaks, alley-oops, lobs, they definitely cost us. We did play hard but it's hard to win when you allow that many easy points."
Carter, a former Minnesota guard.
"We all know that Minnesota is struggling right now," Carter said. "We wanted to come out with the same intensity and energy that we did against San Antonio. The win last night wouldn't have meant anything if we didn't come in here and win.".
"When you're not winning games, things tend to go wrong at the end of games," Iverson said. "We were just fortunate that they couldn't make the plays at the end of the game."
Looking for some offense to complement Jefferson, Minnesota coach Randy Wittman started Jaric and Sebastian Telfair in the backcourt. The duo struggled, shooting a combined 5-for-20, but McCants provided a spark off the bench.
The third-year guard totaled just 15 points on 6-for-19 shooting in his three previous games before looking sharp on Friday.
"He came out and he was playing aggressive tonight," Wittman said. "He had his motor going, playing at a higher energy level. That has to be a constant. I'm not talking about just the points, I'm talking about the effort and the energy."
Kenyon Martin, who recently returned from an injury and is being worked back into the rotation, finished with 11 points for Denver and looked sharp during a stretch in the third quarter where he scored seven points. Kleiza added 17 off the bench.
"The thing with everyone healthy on our team is that we have a lot of versatility, a lot of different ways we can play," Karl said. "I think right now we are just starting to feel who we can become and what we can become. Hopefully we will keep a mental focus of getting better every night and winning the games and if we lose, making sure that teams beat us."
Ryan Gomes had his third straight solid game for Minnesota, finishing with 15 points.
Game notes
Anthony notched his 1,000th career assist and became the sixth-leading scorer in Nuggets history. ... Carter had 10 of his assists by halftime. ... Wolves injured guard Randy Foye will have his knee re-evaluated on Monday. ... Jefferson celebrated his 23rd birthday on Friday.Other Stuff

"I encourage landowners to consider the role pollinators play when developing a pasture or CRP weed management plan," he said.
The term 'pollinators' Bauman said, typically," he said. "I remind folks that along with honey bee decline has come the dramatic decline of local butterfly species, including the iconic monarch butterfly."
Pollinator's survival depends on what we plant
Much of our success in food production can be attributed to technological advances. "For instance the advent of chemicals for weed control has made farming quite different than it was decades ago. Along with the cropland chemicals, advancements in chemicals formulated for broadleaf plant control in pastures also continues to develop. These chemistries can be a great tool, but they can also be detrimental," Bauman said.
He explained that as with any tool, the tool itself cannot be heralded or demonized - it is the appropriate application of the tool that creates successes and failures.
With this in mind, Bauman said there are many factors that play a role in the overall decline of pollinators. "Use of herbicides and insecticides in crop production and conversion of native grasslands to farming are viewed as major contributors," he said. "However, we cannot overlook the critical responsibilities of pasture managers in this discussion."
On one hand, Bauman explained, if it were not for our remaining native pastures many of our pollinator species would be in worse peril than they currently are.
"Our ranchers should be applauded for their efforts in protecting grasslands," he said.  'cleaned up.' Simply stated, Bauman said," he said. "Often, this leads to weed problems."
With spring upon us, Bauman said," he said.
Both are non-native exotic grasses that, although palatable early in spring, can indicate poor range health, he explained. "Look closer and these are the same pastures that are prone to wormwood sage, leafy spurge, thistles, and mid-summer browning due to lack of native warm-season species," he said.
Bauman explained that," Bauman said. "Managers who consider pasture production and diversity as a top priority have a much different 'weed management' program philosophy than those focused solely on cleaning up the pasture."
Plants signal health of grassland
Cattle will include a great many broadleaf plants in their diet if given the opportunity, up to 20 percent or more, said Bauman.
"These broadleaf plants play a critical role in the overall function of rangeland nutrient cycles and soil health," he said. "Infestations of common plants such as ragweed, goldenrod, gumweed, buckbrush, prairie coneflower and other less desirable native broadleaf plants may indicate a need for a shift in grazing management rather than a three to four year spray rotation."
Although judicious use of chemicals for targeted control of certain species may have a place in a well-managed operation, Bauman encourages producers to ask themselves if their own management methods are the primary cause of the weedy infestation and thus the need to apply broadcast chemicals in the first place.
"Careful evaluation of targets may indicate that emphasis asking 'why' weeds persist rather than simply focusing on the weeds may lead to more efficient distribution of input expenses (labor and chemicals), resulting in improved and long-term rangeland health and profitability," he said..

Product code: 060626YOUNGSTOWN, Ohio (WKBN) — Several policies on the campus of Youngstown State University are coming under fire by a national First Amendment advocacy group. the university could use it to restrict speech that is actually protected by the First Amendment.
Students on campus Thursday had differing opinions on the issue.
“To me, personally, not really. I mean, people should have as many rights as they’re supposed to have and not be impeded upon,” said junior Jaclyn Sampson. “People are pretty much open to saying whatever. It’s pretty decent around here. I don’t feel like I am being judged too much.”
But she is concerned about some university policies that could affect her First Amendment rights.
“Sometimes they go a little bit too far and they make you a little worried about what to say and you’re afraid to say stuff,” Sampson said.
Sophomore Zach Gibson doesn’t have a problem with the policies.
“I feel like there should be no harassment because bullying is a big thing nowadays and I think that’s wrong,” Gibson said.
University spokesman Ron Cole said YSU makes a point of allowing students to speak freely.
“I think if you come on campus, you’re going to find very quickly that we have a very open environment,” Cole said.
But, he also stressed that limiting speech that might offend is important to the university climate.
“We want to make sure the exchange of those ideas are done within the confines of respect and integrity, and those kinds of things. So it’s kind of a balance,” Cole said.
Sampson said she sees where Cole is coming from, but also wants to make sure her First Amendment rights are protected.
“There should be some middle ground where it’s like putting some rules into play but not so far that people are afraid to say what they want to say,” Sampson said.Heidi Montag & Karissa Shannon Girl On Girl Sex Tape

Looking for the best apps available for your iOS device? We've rounded up the finest around, including free and paid for apps.
Apple's App Store is one of the biggest success stories of the iOS operating system and there are now over a million apps available for download.
With hundreds, if not thousands of apps, released every month, it can be tricky to find the real gems hidden among the deluge of releases. Fear not, because we've rounded up our favourite apps and games that put in an appearance in 2013, to provide you with a list of top quality titles to download for your iOS device.
Modern Combat 4: Zero Hour
Modern Combat 4 is essentially a mobile take on the Modern Warfare series of console games. This fourth version is by far the best, with sumptuous graphics, a suitably ludicrous back-story and surprisingly capable controls. If you're looking for a good quality first person shooter to play on your iPhone or iPad, this is the game to get.
Get it now for £5 from the App Store.
Cubasis
Cubasis is the cut down version of Steinberg's Cubase audio and midi sequencer. It supports unlimited tracks and has plenty of built-in synths, drum machines and audio samples, so it offers a great way to sketch out tracks before importing them into Cubase on your PC. The price is high, but for those who use Cubase as their main sequencer package, Cubasis is worth the hefty outlay.
Get it now for £35 from the App Store.
FIFA 14
The last version of Fifa was already perhaps the best sports game you could get for your iPhone or iPad, but with this update EA has made it even better. It's bigger than before, as there are more licensed teams, leagues and players, and the controls have been refined too, making it easier to show off your skills. The graphics are beautiful, with high frame-rates and crowds that cheer you on with chants and footy songs.
Get it now for free from the App Store.
Dubble
Like many of the best iOS apps, Dubble takes a very simple idea and executes it to perfection. It's a photo sharing service with a difference, as it takes a photo you've uploaded and mixes it with one from another randomly chosen stranger to create a new image. Often the results are strikingly beautiful and you can easily share them via services such as Instagram.
Get it now for free from the App Store.
My Muppets Show
My Muppets Show is a simulation and music game aimed at children. It lets your child take on a managerial role where they have to recruit and reunite the all-star cast and coax them into putting on the best show ever. Along the way there are extra tasks to perform, such as clearing the stage of rubbish and building concession stands to keep the hungry Muppets happy and performing at their best.
Get it now for free from the App Store.
Djay2
The original Djay was already the best DJing app on iOS, but the developers have managed to improve on it with this update. It's been rewritten from the ground up for better performance and also has a number of new features such as the handy waveform view, a built-in sampler and the great looking virtual-vinyl screen.
Get it now for £7 from the App Store.
Google Play Music
It took a while, but Google has finally released a dedicated Play Music app for iOS. It allows you to access Google's paid for music service, but perhaps more importantly you can use it to store your own music on Google's cloud service for free, so you can access it from pretty much any devices at any time. You can store up to 20,000 tracks, so all but the largest libraries are supported.
Get it now for free from the App Store.
Where’s My Water 2
This offers more of the same great puzzle gameplay from the original game, but adds new challenges, including themed ducks to collect through achievements and over 100 levels to solve. In most respects it's a fun and worthy sequel to the original, but be warned that the game's freemium model is annoying.
Get it now for free from the App Store.
Real Racing 3
Real Racing 3 delivers the most realistic racing experience available on a touch-screen device. Everything from the car models and textures, to the lifelike physics as you speed around real-world tracks, fully immerses you in the racing experience. Its freemium model is slightly intrusive, but it still holds the crown as the best touchscreen racing game.
Get it now for free from the App Store.
Adobe Photoshop Touch for phone
It's been available for the iPad for a while, but Adobe only got around to producing an iPhone version towards the middle of this year. Creating a decent photo editor on a small screen is no mean feat, but despite a few cracked eggs, Adobe has got many of the ingredients here right. So, if you're looking for something beyond simple photo retouching and filtering for your late-model phone, Photoshop Touch hits the mark.
Get it now for £3 from the App Store.
Infinity Blade III
Its game play formula hasn’t changed much -- you still do an awful lot of swiping and tapping on the screen as you take down jumbo-sized baddies -- but this update has even more sumptuous graphics and tonnes more content than the previous games. It's also the ideal title for showing off your new iPad Air.
Get it now for £5 from the App Store.
Mailbox
Mailbox is an alternative email app for people who use Google's Gmail service. It has a minimalist interface, lets you file away messages to revisit later, and makes organising emails swift and seamless. If you want an uncluttered, low-maintenance email client that will help keep your inbox organised and empty, Mailbox is the app for you.

Mr Potato Head Create & Play
Kids will love this digital update of the child's toy, as Mr Potato Head is surprisingly addictive in the way it lets you create and customise your spud using over 200 mix-and-match parts. Once you've built your own unique creation you can take him on spud-tacular interactive adventures or just capture pictures to share with friends.
Get it now for £2.49 from the App Store.
Angry Birds Star Wars II
The first Angry Birds Star Wars game was a smash hit and this sequel ups the ante by adding new characters from the prequel movies, such as the younger Obi-Wan, Padme and Anakin, along with dark-side characters like General Grievous, Count Dooku, and Darth Maul. The classic slingshot play mechanics haven’t changed much, but this game is just as addictive as ever, and is still a great download for all ages.
Buy it for 69p from the App Store.
Badland
Badland was a worthy winner of an Apple design award, as its graphics are not just original, but also beautiful to look at. Imagine Rayman as a shadow-puppet show and you'll be pretty close to how good this game looks on a retina display. The gameplay is simple -- you guide a weird looking puff ball through an obstacle-filled landscape -- but it's very engaging and addictive.
Get it now for £2.49 from the App Store.
Device 6
Device 6 is brilliantly original and quite difficult to describe. In a way it's a strange combination of a novel and a room-escape puzzle, but it executes its concept so masterfully that it adds up to much more than the sum of its parts. It doesn’t take all that long to play, but once completed it sticks in the mind for some time after.
Get it now for £2.49 from the App Store.
Google Maps
Apple's Maps app just isn’t up to scratch, so every iOS user should have Google Maps installed on their device. Google Maps for iOS has a brilliant interface, supports turn-by-turn navigation and also has the company's excellent Street View feature. Simply put, with this app Google has set the standard for what mobile navigation should be.
Get it now for free from the App Store.
Moves 2.0
Moves 2.0 is one of the first apps to make use of the iPhone 5S' M7 motion processor. At its simplest the app is an activity tracker that can log activities such as walking, running and cycling and then present a record of them to you via its futuristic looking user interface. And thanks to the M7 processor it's able to do this using as little battery power as possible.
Get it now for £1.49 from the App Store.
Oceanhorn
It may be a rip off of Zelda, and it's far from the cheapest game on the App Store, but Oceanhorn is still a must have thanks to its mix of sumptuous graphics, engaging narrative and quality gameplay. It's not quite as good as the game it draws its influence from, but it comes pretty close.
Get it now for £6 from the App Store.
Tweetbot 3
If you're a Twitter user, but aren't overly keen on the official client it's well worth trying Tweetbot 3. Thanks to its well-polished interface and rich feature set it makes browsing your timeline a lot of fun. This latest update of the app has been redesigned to look better under iOS 7, and includes gesture-based browsing for your timeline, customisable buttons, and tons more useful features.

When you're playing in front of almost 20,000 people -- as Metallica did at Nashville's Sommet Center Monday night -- it's important for most performers to make a flashy entrance.
Earlier this year, AC/DC took the stage joined by a super-sized flaming locomotive, and just last weekend, Taylor Swift rose out of the ground decked out in a glittering marching band uniform.
Metallica, as you might expect, is a different beast. As the opening heartbeats to "That Was Just Your Life" -- the leadoff track for their new album, Death Magnetic -- echoed through the Sommet Monday night, the band was nowhere to be found. A wall of laser beams signaled their eventual entrance, and even when the riffs kicked into high gear, the band stalked the stage, planted in the center of the arena, in darkness. As frontman James Hetfield approached any of the multiple microphones planted at all corners of the stage, he'd be lit from underneath like he was telling a scary story -- but that was about all the illumination the concert got for the first five minutes.
Then, during a climactic break in the song, every light in the house was switched on, and the real spectacle was revealed: the metal vets, in all their human glory, with their stage on the brink of being swallowed by thousands of ravenous fans.
On the latest leg of the band's "World Magnetic" tour -- of which Nashville was the kick-off date -- the band appears to be hammering home the fact that they're a band of the people. And they’re a surprisingly positive one, at that.GamesBeat Sony’s milestones: 50M PlayStation 3s sold, 8M PlayStation Moves shipped April 15, 2011 1:07 AM Dean Takahashi 0 Sony said today it has sold more than 50 million PlayStation 3 consoles to date and shipped more than 8 million PlayStation Move motion-sensing controllers. Those are astounding numbers for any consumer electronics products. But in the video game business, they still mean that Sony is in third place among the Big Three. The good news is that all three major console makers are enjoying a robust and profitable business in this generation of consoles. By comparison, Nintendo has sold more than 86 million Wii consoles and Microsoft has sold around 53 million Xbox 360s. And Microsoft has shipped more than 10 million motion-sensing Kinect systems since November. Sony marked the milestones at the end of its fiscal year, as of March 29. The PlayStation 3 went on sale in 2006, while the PlayStation Move went on sale in September. Since sales continue to be brisk, Sony isn’t expected to launch a new video game console anytime soon. Nintendo, by contrast, has seen a significant slowdown in the past year for the Wii, and it is now rumored to be announcing a new console at the E3 game show in June. Sony also said that the PlayStation Network now has more than 75 million registered accounts in 59 countries, across both the PS 3 and the PlayStation Portable. The PlayStation Store on the network has a total of 105,988 downloadable items, including games, movies and TV shows. Sony and its partners now have 155 Move titles on the market, while the PS 3 has 2,128 games available. Those games have sold more than 480 million units worldwide. In the U.S., more than 80 Move titles will be available by the end of the year.Product Information
What It Is
The Uglydolls are getting dressed up for Halloween, and they're going as iconic monsters from Universal Studios movies. The new collection, called Universal Monsters Uglydolls, features Wedgehead as Frankenstein, Ice-Bat as Dracula, Ox as Wolfman, Tray as Bride of Frankenstein, Big Toe as the Creature from the Black Lagoon, and Babo as Mummy. Like the original Uglydolls, the Universal Monsters Uglydolls each come with a hangtag that tells a little bit about each character's personality and why he or she chose to dress as his or her monster. For example, Ice-Bat has always been drawn to Dracula's smooth style and nothing beats a cape with a popped collar. Each Universal Monsters Uglydoll is sold separately.
Is It Fun?
These new Uglydolls are just as funny, soft, and collectible as the originals. They make a great Halloween gift or décor item as well as a fun themed addition to an Uglydolls collection.
Who It’s For
Universal Monsters Uglydolls are for ages 1 and up.

When I tried to connect, it would give and error that it was not able to activate the adapter. A quick Google search and I had the answer. It looks like the installer puts some bum data in the DisplayName registry value so you need to open that key up and remove the bad data.
Open the following key:
HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\vpnva
Change the DisplayName string to “Cisco AnyConnect VPN Virtual Miniport Adapter for Windows x64″

[edit] Consolation prizes
I know that Jiml likes to award lots of ribbons, and I approve of that, but I think that the MNB Geohash ribbon is not appropriate this time. The page for that award says that it should be awarded when the adventurers "only just fail, due to mother nature's impediments" [bold type as on the award page]. I think "it was raining so we didn't want to go" is not in the spirit of the MNB ribbon. I'm also not sure about the Prize poultry ribbon - the page for that one says that one "most certainly may not take this achievement for sitting at home, too chicken to even try geohashing". That would seem to rule this out as well. Looks to me like it was simply a planned expedition that didn't happen. You don't have to get ribbons for everything. — Benjw {talk} 13:50, 21 November 2012 (EST)You might think that the holiday season is ending, but, in fact, we’ve got another holiday coming up in a couple of weeks — Martin Luther King Jr.’s birthday.

MOVEDManuel's thoughts on the handling of the rotation in the playoffs
Posted by Mandy Housenick | September 20, 2011 at 09:00 AM
Charlie Manuel likes giving his starters a chance to go deep into games.
Roy Halladay was the latest to do so. He lasted eight innings in the final game of the Phillies’ four-game set against the Cardinals.
Halladay wasn’t in danger of coming out sooner, mostly because the Phillies never found themselves in a threatening position until the bottom of the ninth inning.
But Manuel’s strategy may vary a little come playoff time, especially if the Phillies are down by a run in the seventh inning with a couple guys on base. AKA: starters may be yanked before their pitch counts or fatigue become an issue.
“There’s times when you look up there and you think of our starters and how good they are,” Manuel said. “But when you’re losing a game in the seventh inning , more than likely, you’ve gotta try to win it. You can do anything. But the biggest thing you’ve gotta do is catch up and tie the game up and win it. How can you win it in the seventh inning? You’re nine outs away from losing the game. You’ve gotta do something.
"Depends on how you feel (about) the bullpen. At the same time, more than likely, I’ve always tried to win the game."
DINGERS: The Phillies lost their first four-game series of the season since Aug. 23-26, 2010. They had won each of their first eight four-game series this season. ... Polly is hitting .381 (8-for-21) in his last six games. He's hit .333 (19-for-57) over his last 16 games. ... Jimmy Rollins hit his 100th career triple in the 9th. ... Monday's game marked the 200th consecutive regular-season sellout. ... Ryan Howard had an injection in his left foot in the hopes it helps the bursitis he's been battling. He's expected to be back Thursday, he said on Sunday. ... The Phillies scored their runs Monday in the second and ninth innings. In the second, Polly singled and scored on Chooch's RBI single. ... In the ninth, Chooch doubled and scored when Rollins tripled. Rollins then scored on Shane Victorino's groundout.

Make your way down to the door on the bottom level, north side of the building. The Mk. III will start to unlock the door, but it's a long process in which the Mk. III cannot be interrupted. Lucky for you, a Gekko comes out from the elevator and into the 1F building. You'll need to keep the Gekko distracted while the Mk. III opens the door, but that's a task easier said than done if you're trying to avoid alerts.
Quickly run under the platform that the elevator exits to and hide in a dark corner behind one of the support beams (we suggest full cammo here). When the Gekko jumps down to the lower floor, fire one of your noisy guns to get the Gekko's attenion. If you press up against the northern wall under the elevator, you should achieve a cammo index of 99, which makes you all but invisible.
Wait for the Gekko to waddle over to your location and then waddle away before popping out to do more shooting. The Gekko will go into caution, but these don't count as alerts on your record. When the Mk. III finally opens the door, wait for the Gekko to face away from you (facing the east) and then pop out to shoot it in the leg. You'll cripple the Gekko long enough to run out and exit through the northern Notes: This was inspired by a slaw-like salad that accompanied my croissant at Cafe Le Soleil in Madison, WI. It was bright, with just a hint of sweetness. I knew there was apple, and probably maple syrup. It was also inspired by the purchase of a julienne peeler. Raw vegetables are delightful when sliced into lovely thin ribbons! - Tallgrass Kitchen
Serves 4
Haystack Salad
- 2 medium carrots
- 1 small zucchini
- 1 large apple (preferably a sweet, crisp variety like Honeycrisp or Fuji)
- Shred each vegetable and fruit into long ribbons with a julienne peeler. Alternatively, you could shred them with the shredding disk of your food processor, but the shreds won't be as long or pretty. If your carrots are sweet and thin-skinned, no need to peel. Definitely don't peel the apple, as the peel adds some lovely color to the salad.
Maple Vinaigrette
- 1/4 cup apple cider vinegar
- 1 tablespoon dijon mustard
- 1/2 cup neutral vegetable oil
- 4 tablespoons pure maple syrup
- 1 juice from one small lime
- 1 pinch salt
- Either add all ingredients to a jar and shake vigorously, or whisk everything together but the oil. Whisk the oil into the liquid in a steady stream.
- Generously drizzle dressing on salad and toss well. You will have leftover dressing - it keeps great in the fridge for at least a week.

posted on BF on the touring, and vintage, and mechanics section. I asked him what his longest
tour was prior to this one, ( He said 3 days ), I asked what he was averaging a day, around
70 miles, but yesterday 90 due to finding some where to stop. I was so inspired by this guy,
I drove back home, and got my bike and returned to the store, and have a new respect for what
can be achieved if someone wants it bad enough..I was just to lazy to push the bike up
my driveway, and thinking on saving my energy for when my son got home from school to
go on a ride with him, ( I NEED to get out and put on MORE miles. ) and start getting
stronger, than being content with my rides....RichardWillow Smith

Denis, do you suggest that translations are split into several files, or just ordering the big file to have the most "important" strings (indeed, the most important or most widely used prgrams or pieces of source code) at the beginning? > * Dpkg is being translated via Rosetta, how are you going to merge > translations? I can't speak for Scott's way to handle things with Rosetta for dpkg in Ubuntu (though I'm pretty sure that Ubuntu's dpkg is the same than the one in Debian), but at this moment, the translation handling for Debian's dpkg is indeed done by myself in my own arch branches of the two devel branches used by Scott. I have not looked at things in Rosetta recently, so I don't know if new translations have been added. When he releases a new version (either 1.10, targeted at sarge, or 1.13 targeted at etch and currently uploaded to experimental), Scott merges his branch with mine first. 1.10 is under string freeze while 1.13 may get string changes. Up to now, I haven't called for translation updates for 1.13 in order to avoid confusion. At this moment, there are very few changes between both branches, when it comes at the programs output (only 2 fuzzy strings for languages which are complete in 1.10).Travel Bars We Love – Liberties, Cambridge, OH
What if you are traveling I-70 in East-Central Ohio and need a cocktail?
What if you find yourself in Cambridge, OH and the only bar you see is inside of Ruby Tuesdays?
Well you head to Liberties Tavern/Bar inside of the local Days Inn.
Sure it is not much of a bar. Heck, we think it even doubles as the free breakfast location for overnight guests. We are not 100% sure because we stayed at a nicer hotel down the street.
But this bar is fun.
Sure it only has 1 tap.
But that tap spits out $1.50 beers.
This place is hard to explain. Once inside you feel welcomed. Maybe it is the bartender giving alcohol whipped cream samples. Maybe it is the diverse crowd made up of world travelers. Maybe we were just drunk.
This place deserves a stop. Just don’t be surprised at the limited hours. We also think that local Ohio liquor laws do not allow them to be open on Sundays."Nobody who works full-time should ever have to live in poverty" —Obama on why it's time to #RaiseTheWage: go.wh.gov/tpNRsK #ActOn1010—

OMG. Shonda Rhimes retweeted me!!! This is like the fourth time she’s done so and I still go “WHAAAAAAAAAAAT?!?!”
Tuesday, you like me. You really really like me. :)
:) :) :) That’s fantastic NW! She’s obviously as huge a fan of yours as you are of hers. Ping!
All ex-players except Kareem.
confused w/ your comment….. Lebron and D-Wade are current players…..here are some more:

“I’m just thrilled with what Commissioner Silver did. He got on the case immediately and got to the bottom of whatever mysteries that there were involved in this, and figured out what the truth was and his actions and focus were so on the mark. It was unbelievable,” he said in a press conference following the NBA’s announcement.
I really appreciate Mayor KJ’s tweet.
I think this Commissioner Adam Silver is gonna do just fine, yup, just fine. He looked plenty pissed when he laid out Sterling’s punishment. And I’m glad it’s the new commissioner who’s handing out this punishment. So, David Stern was deaf and blind to Sterling’s actions, but there’s a new sheriff and he has no loyalty to anyone or anything except the truth and fairness in the NBA.
For those who missed the press conference.
My recommendation …
Thanks for the excellent selection of #RaiseTheWage tweets, NW!!
LOOKS LIKE STERLING REALLY GOT SHAVED WITH THE CLIPPERS………….PUNN INTENDED. I ALWAYS TELL RACISTS THAT WHEN THEY PASS GOD WILL PUT THEM IN A ROOM FOR ETERNITY WITH EVERYONE ELSE WHO IS A DIFFERENT COLOR!,,,RACISM IS A CRIME…STAY HOME STERLING..YOU’RE BANNED FROM GAME TIME!!!!!…FOR LIFE OR EVERY 10,000 MILES WHICHEVER COMES FIRST!

Oh no!!!!! 2 things were said!!! What to do, what to do as a reporter!!!!!
He’s disgusting ….
…. and completely misses the synchronicity of the issues being addressed by Senator Reid and Adam Silver.

Stephen A. Smith puts the blame squarely on the L.A. Chapter of the NAACP for undercutting the public outing of Donald Sterling’s past racists acts when they awarded him a lifetime achievement award.
Again, the cover-up proved just as bad as the crime.

The chairman of a local chapter of the Illinois Republican Party called President Barack Obama an “a**” and said if the media focused about the offspring of a zebra and a donkey there would be two “living creatures” getting plenty of attention that is partially white and partially black.
The joke, by Winnebago County Republican Central Committee (WCRCC) chairman Jim Thompson, came in a regular newsletter sent out to supporters. It came at the end of the newsletter.

Paging Justice Roberts……paging Justice Roberts…..
Hey knoller, here’s a great timing issue for ya!
Should I print out and send to that Chait guy, so he can check to see if Clinton endured same? Nah, waste of paper. I take no joy in the thousands of examples of how wrong he is, but I would like him to know it and admit it. Not holding my breath.
Linda, this county chairman needs to be publicly shamed and excoriated by every Democratic leader in the state–no exceptions. Every mayor, every state rep, every Democratic county chair, every state and national level official in Illinois has to work together to make sure this man’s remarks are rubbed into the faces of every Republican. This kind of thing cannot and must not be tolerated.
I have much love for KJ!
Me too and I see a Governor’s job in his future. Just sayin….
I wonder if Silver was inspired by President Obama’s statement that he was a decent man and would do the right thing, All it takes is for decent men and women to keep standing up and saying “NO, that’s not acceptable. We won’t look away”. Sometimes we can go for years and years when it seems the decent voices are too soft or too easily drowned out. But then the moment comes when people are repelled enough that a voice finally pushes through the noise, a line is drawn and we move forward –one small step–toward justice. It happened with Rush Limbaugh and Sandra Fluke and it happened today. Some cleansing wash passes over the ugly and we what the world could be like if we let love overcome hate.

Happy happy day to you!! You don’t look a day over ##!!

It looks like Van der zee’s work but I did a google and came upon this from pininterest. It’s captioned as “Easter Sunday in Harlem by Weegee the Famous.” I’m not familiar with that photographer.

hahahahaahahahaha. I loooovvveeee Ride or Die Joe
Joy Reid had some sports reporter from The Nation on named Dave Zirin…..who she praised as MSNBC’s go to guy for sports right after he attacked Kevin Johnson and said Johnson’s comments praising Silver made him very angry……and that Johnson should have DEMANDED a timeline for trying to get Sterling ousted as an owner.
That’s because Robert Mason, Jr., Miami Heat player and VP, Players Union, made a much stronger statement that called for a timetable and accountability in Silver’s efforts to broker a sale.
Shockey Dockey………Donald Sterling has spoken already?

HA! …well aren’t you the lucky one with all these extra mats. :) I’m not calling names, but you may very well have to share the mats with one or two other individuals, so try to not use them all up!
I’ll try but no guarantees. Y’all may have to make your own arrangements with our Yardarm to have extra supplies on hand. A girl has to be prepared for the unexpected cuz sometimes Chips and NW springs surprises on us. Ya know :)

Yay! President Obama is back.
YAY! He landed ahead of schedule, and he seems in great spirits! :)
Oh, oh, oh … I am so glad he is home! I love you Mr. President! I loved all the pics of him on his Asian tour (thanks TOD); I loved the outpouring of love and respect for this man abroad. The world loves our President! God has blessed us so very much with the honor of having Barack Obama as our President, leader, and Commander-in-Chief. But, I am so happy to know tonight he will be at home in the White House, maybe sipping some wine and hot soup (to dispel the cool rainy weather) and hugging our beautiful First Lady and Malia and Sasha and Mrs. Robinson. Oh, and the puppies too!
Yes, I hope he’ll have a toast to the progress made today with NBA and voting rights in WI and PA.
I saw on Twitter that he plans to watch the Bulls-Wizard game tonight.
GOOD for him!
Is he attending or watching at home?
I’m not sure, but sounds more like he plans to watch it from home.
Wouldn’t that just break all the COOL-O-METERS if he showed up in person to an NBA game tonight? I think I’d lose my voice!!
It would but the game is in Chicago tonight. If Chicago wins, the series comes back to DC Thursday night and I would almost guarantee that he will be there.
Ah, I see. That would be so great to see him at a game after all that’s happened.
PERFECT.
WAIT!! POTUS wasn’t due back for another hour!!
Well, welcome home, Mr. President. Soooooo happy you’re back to us.
Why are my flights always LATE?! :-)
Seriously. NICE to have AF1 with no speed limits!!
I’m just going to have to become President Meta, that’s the only solution I can see here.
I’d vote for you in a heartbeat and volunteer on your campaign and register voters and and…well you know. Whatever it takes :cool:
I vote YES. I think the TOD takeover of the WH would be complete.
I am a little (well, more than a little) weird; I kind of like the weather for tonight there as long as he makes it safely to the White House, cause then I can envision him having a hot bath, warm hugs, furry puppies, maybe cold wine, hot tea and soup. Sounds so good I may go home to the same unless the tornados get me first.
Report: President Obama told press pool on AF-1, he plans to watch the Bulls-Wizards game tonight.
This is perfect weather to sit in front of the teevee watching your favorite team play b-ball with your sweetie by your side and some good snacks.

I was on a work assignment several years ago that went to every state.
So I've seen a few … places. And it seems like every place has something unique about it.
I was thinking about this when I was looking at the 49th Legislative District in Vancouver.
No one would disagree that it's likely the most liberal place in our county.
It has continually re-elected Democratic state Rep. Jim Moeller. No further proof required. In other words, my buddy Jim isn't your average "let's move closer to the center" kind of Democrat.
If this were poker, he'd be all-in on the far left. He'd make filmmaker Michael Moore look normal.
Thus my fascination with where Jim hangs his hat in the 49th District. Who lives in this place? I know, I know, they're just regular folks like me and you. I'm sure that's true.
Still, I suspect there are a few pockets of my all-time favorite groups: Beatniks, hippies and governmental workers.
(I strive to have a little of all three in me! They're the best!)
Clearly, Jim knows how to keep his constituency happy. Spread the wealth.
This year, Jim is running against Republican Carolyn Crain.
Now, let's be honest. Jim has about as much chance of losing this race as I do of having a landslide of voters writing my name in for president. (I don't think there has ever been a president with Italian DNA. Whatsamatta u! )
Still, Carolyn is very well-informed, has likely been to more public meetings than most public officials, and knows — really knows — the issues.
But like Jim and me, she's far from perfect. I suspect someone has told her more than once she "doesn't play well with others." And she can be a little more than rough around the edges. Just a wee bit combative. To her credit, if you're looking for someone to hold the line on taxes, she's for you.
But I just don't think that's the 49th District's cup of tea.
So say good night.
• • •
Speaking of taxes, when we had both Carolyn and Jim in for a discussion with our editorial board, I couldn't resist putting Jim on the spot.
I asked Jim this question:
"If this election were only about saving taxpayers money and you had to vote, would you vote for you or Carolyn?"
Now let that question settle in a little bit. This is a tough question for most Democrats, but it should have been a backbreaker for Jim.
After all, I don't think Jim has ever — ever — seen a tax hike he didn't cuddle up with.
Back to this question. Most politicians likely would have pivoted away from it and answer this way:
"Look, this election isn't only about saving taxpayers money. It's about making tough choices in a tough economy and assuring we continue to protect those who are most vulnerable among us."
So I give Jim huge props for not pivoting. Instead, he answered the question directly:
"I'd vote for me."
Well, maybe he should have pivoted. I mean, huh?
Come on, man! You'd vote for you if the only issue was saving taxpayers money? Cavallo sterco!
Since I didn't believe it, I had to go back and look at a short video I took of the exchange. Check it out on our website.
And good luck, guys. Love ya both!

842 Pastors Prayer Partners
This past weekend at Cascade Hills Church we signed on 842 people to the Pastor’s Prayer Partner ministry. What a blessing! I am humbled by the tremendous response of our people. 842 Pastor’s Prayer Partners devoted themselves to praying for me and my family daily. They will then gather in teams to pray each week prior to our 3 weekend services in private rooms on campus. Their teams will also join me publicly on the platform to kneel and pray for me and the church in every service this year. My prayer partners also provide my wife and I a list of their prayer requests and we personally pray for each one of them throughout the year. We take that very serious. Every year our Pastor’s Prayer Partners see the favor of God in their lives. This year, with the increased number of Pastor’s Prayer Partners it should be our greatest advance into the areas of our lives where God can do His best work. I love my prayer partners. We meet quarterly for breakfast or lunch to fellowship to discuss our needs and progress. I attest that my life has been an answer to prayer, our ministry is upheld by prayer, & the highest priority of our marriage has been to seek God through prayer. When I became a new Christian at the age of 18, I read that if I’d enter my prayer closet and pray that my Heavenly Father would meet me there. I began that process back then. When God sent Debbie as my life partner, I discovered her to be more devoted to prayer than I was. Our 3 sons, now grown and married, say the greatest comfort they had growing up was knowing that not one time in their entire life did they ever wake up and not find their mother in her study or the living room praying. Not once! In over 30 years of marriage, I can say the same. Never have I seen her go a morning without serious praying. I have been challenged by the pace she set in prayer more than anything else. We’ve recently assisted 3 other churches in the past 8 weeks to start a Pastor’s Prayer Partner Ministry. We will lead 2 more churches this month to do this. In one church they’d baptized only one person the year prior. After they began a Pastor’s Prayer Partner ministry, they baptized 20 people 2 weeks later. The disciples were taught to pray. Jesus modeled prayer, He said His Fathers house is to be a house of prayer. Ministries built on past traditions or new trends, though opposite in methods and worship, still end up empty in real life transformation. Prayer provides God’s power. Prayer unites the people, prayer opens the heavens with conviction upon the lost and strength for the Christian. Last weekend I met a new convert after our services who had never been in a church in his life. His friends were crying and shocked that he was converted. His words to me were, “I was drawn here, I feel like I’ve been blind all of my life, I’m clean now and at peace with God”. That’s what happens where people pray. I am often asked, if I could start my ministry all over again, what would I do differently? My first response is that I would have begun a Pastor’s Prayer Partner ministry from day one. I’m personally tired of seeing churches up for sale, fighting, splitting, or “new church plants” with gimmicks to attract the already “churched” and “vision” that never builds a holy life or Godly church. There is no substitute for prayer. God can do in 5 seconds what we couldn’t pull off in 50 years. My hope and passion is to kindle a fire in a life that finds the fellowship of God in prayer as rewarding as I have discovered. Pursue Him. He is and can provide all you need.

Church Search
I’m often asked by friends who are moving away, “Is there a church you can recommend in such & such city”? Two of my three sons and their families live in other places and they went through this experience also. For those with such questions, my answers are not always the name of a specific church, but rather the principles that I’d use to guide me in finding a “good church”. Here they are: (1) Doctrine. The content of what you receive is more important than the package it comes in. Now I believe in being relevant, seeker-sensitive, and providing new methods of delivery and presentation as a means to connect with the unchurched & the next generation. It’s highly effective. But at the root, if the doctrine is not Biblical and sound, the end result is a life built on sand. When tough times come, and they will, a life without a Biblical foundation will not survive. (2) Example in Leadership. Check out the personal life of the leaders. How do their children live? How’s their marriage? How do they manage their own finances? Do they pay their bills? How long have they been in this place and how did they leave the last place they were in? Do they seek only those who don’t attend a church or do they attempt to take members from other churches? These are ethical questions. Regardless of talk, remember, “Facts do not lie”. (3) Purpose. What’s the mission of this church? What are they called to do, and are they actually doing it? It’s hard for me to “buy in” to a church that says it cares about people and travels hundreds of miles to do “missions” for those of other races, when those same people would not be accepted in their church if they moved here and wanted to attend. Look at things like how many people are being baptized, are growing in their faith, are serving others, if they give financially (that’s a fact that doesn’t lie). When a church actually knows and does it’s purpose it “weeds” out some and attracts people serious about faith. A mark of a church doing its mission is that it will be a blessed by God and despised by the devil. One of my sons goes to a church that is often criticized for its size. He says, “The devil hates that church so that affirms to me that Gods using it”. Now remember, there’s no perfect church, because there are no perfect people. If you find one, don’t join it because since you are not perfect you’ll mess it up. But that’s not what to look for. Follow those simple guidelines and you’ll narrow your decision toward one that helps you grow and develop.
In closing, here’s our own story. I’ve been pastor at Cascade Hills Church in Columbus Georgia since Easter (April) of 1983. I celebrate my 30th wedding anniversary in July to the one and only woman in my life, Debbie. We raised 3 son, all married, love God, have good careers and know their purpose in life. Cascade Hills Church is devoted to reaching the unchurched for Christ and has been for the 27 years I’ve been there. Not once in 27 years have I ever asked a person attending another church to leave their church for ours. Not once. God loves other churches too and those attending there are needed there. I am a friend to pastors and other churches, not by words but by example here. Every year for the past 18 years we’ve led our city and the region in baptisms of those that come to Christ. We give generously to missions at levels that are surprising and our people serve our local community with genuine care for others. Our church isn’t the church for everyone and it doesn’t have to be. I only say this because that’s our story. I sincerely hope this information helps you in you if you are ever in search for a church.

Treating obesity and Type 2 diabetes
Weight loss surgery as a standard of care for Type 2 diabetes and obesity has taken a major step forward following the release of a landmark position statement from the International Diabetes Federation (IDF).
Figures from IDF state that there are currently 285 million people with diabetes worldwide, which is set to rise to 438 million by 2030. This astounding figure, driven by the global problem of growing waistlines, has led to a detailed review of the role of bariatric or weight loss surgery – a series of procedures such as adjustable gastric banding (Lap-Banding) and gastric bypass performed on people who are obese.
Monash University’s Associate Professor John Dixon and Professor Paul Zimmet, also from Baker IDI Heart and Diabetes Institute, were part of the four global leaders who chaired the consensus group.
Supported by a group of public health, diabetes, health economic, obesity and surgical experts, the group found that clinically severe obesity is a complex and chronic medical condition which can be substantially improved with conventional bariatric surgery.
Professor Dixon said, “Type 2 diabetes is a varied and complex disorder and, while all its causes have yet to be fully explained, weight gain and obesity are considered the primary risk factors.
“The dramatic rise in obesity and diabetes has become a disastrous global public health crisis and demands urgent attention from governments, healthcare systems and the medical community,” said Professor Dixon.
The expert group combined the available evidence for efficacy, safety and cost-effectiveness of the established bariatric procedures, comparing it to current standard therapy for people with obesity and Type 2 diabetes.
After exploring the effects of bariatric surgery, the consensus group found that the procedure could improve glycaemic control and other obesity-diabetes related conditions.
“In the majority of patients treated, the Type 2 diabetes appears to remit completely. Although we see no active clinical evidence of the disease we do not call this a cure but a remission,” said Professor Dixon.
The research findings indicated that bariatric surgery can provide an appropriate treatment for people with Type 2 diabetes and obesity who are not achieving recommended treatment targets with medical therapies, especially in the presence of other major cardiovascular risk factors and obesity related diseases.
“Bariatric surgery should be incorporated into standard Type 2 diabetes treatment programs. The establishment of national bariatric surgical registries is also recommended,” said Professor Dixon.
The position statement found that various types of bariatric surgery, originally developed to treat morbid obesity, constitute powerful options to improve diabetes in severely obese patients. This often normalises blood glucose levels, reducing or avoiding the need for medications and providing a potentially cost-effective approach to treating the disease.
“Continuing research is essential to prevent the onset of obesity and Type 2 diabetes. At the same time, effective treatment must also be available for people who have already been diagnosed – for many surgery is the most effective therapy,” said Professor Dixon.
Over his 13 years at Monash Professor Dixon has had a major role in research into the effects of bariatric surgery on health, including conducting the first, and to date the only, high level randomised controlled trial comparing conventional therapy with surgery as a treatment for diabetes. Monash University has led the world in this area of research.6 Ways to Increase Your Creativity
Creativity is usually an aspect of a business that is overlooked as it’s difficult, if not impossible to quantify.
Owners and managers often place a value on “thinking out of the box.” But if creativity is so important why do large and small companies often leave it to chance?
Entrepreneurs such as Richard Branson have always been keen to use creativity at the workplace to help innovate. – “At Virgin, we encourage and reward creativity in our employees and we have enjoyed the success of empowering other people’s good ideas.”
1. Artwork
Replace the standard corporate posters in the office with a piece of art that is a talking point such as contemporary art or a sculpture.
Try some websites like×200.com and for some affordable art that’s different from the norm.
2. Plants
A study by the Texas A&M University research team showed.
Your local plant & flower nursery.
3. Notepad
Taking notes increases retention of ideas and it also gives you ideas to build on later. Sometimes a keyword can jog your memory about a place, a conversation or an idea you had. We all have sparks of inspiration which can be lost forever if they aren’t noted down.
A pen and paper shouldn’t be hard to find.
4. Exercise
Creativity improves when you exercise. It’s true. The type of exercise doesn’t matter, and the boost lasts for at least two hours afterward. However, there’s a catch: this is the case only for the physically fit. For those who rarely exercise, the fatigue from aerobic activity counteracts the short-term benefits.
Open door, run around.
5. Make mistakes
Edward de Bono once said that “It is better to have enough ideas for some of them to be wrong, than to be always right by having no ideas at all.”
Don’t fear failing.
6. Talk to children/strangers
It sounds odd, but we tend to talk to people who are either in the same workplace or who have similar interests, it’s human nature. However, we tend to not question the way things are done because we have a similar mindset to those around us. By listening to other people who have different mindset to us, we open up new possibilities of the ways things are which enables us to look at things from a different perspective.
I know it’s fictional but watch a film like BIG. A classic example of a ‘child’ in an adult society giving a new spin on ideas.
Gavin Smith is the founder of, a new site putting a creative twist on the art market.

Initial tester expectations:
I really had no idea what I was getting when I applied for this test. The
Hardrock Boots are not available on the website yet, but after viewing the Hardrock shoes
I was hoping that I was going to get a mid height trail running shoe of some sort. For me,
this meant that the Hardrock boots were probably going to be a tight fitting trail shoe
with a mid-height boot top slapped on for fun.
Tester's Description:
The Montrail Hardrock Boots appear to be a cross between a trail running shoe and
a hiking boot, with a lot more of the shoe's bloodline being apparent. There is no leather
present on this boot, it all appears to be synthetic rubber and plastic. Besides
the height and speed lace system, the sole seems to be the only other boot-like feature
that I have discovered on the Hardrock Boots.
The Hardrock Boots are an attractive gray and orange color scheme
with black highlights on certain portions of the boot. The Hardrock Boots utilize normal
bootlace guides on the first four lacing points, but the top four (two on each side)
utilize speed lace hooks which are bright orange and easy to see and use. The laces
connect to the tongue of the boot for several of the lacing points, then separate and go
back to normal lacing points on either side of the tongue.
Overall, I have to describe this as a light weight mix of boot and trail running shoe. The
design looks interesting after my initial inspection and I am rather excited to see how
well it performs in the field.
Initial thoughts:
I normally wear a size 10.5 shoe, but I always buy size 11.5 hiking boots to accommodate
my hiking socks and liners. When I saw that the Hardrock Boots were only a size 11, I was
a bit worried. After slipping into my hiking socks and then putting on the Hardrock Boots,
I was more than mildly surprised. The arches of the boots hit my foot arches perfectly and
they were really comfortable right out of the box. The toe box on the boots was also
large. In fact, the toe box is much larger than I ever expected. The toe box is very
definitely boot-like for me with tons of room for my feet. Not too much room, but
plenty for foot expansion on the trail. Whereas I had expected a tight fitting
shoe/boot mixture, this was a pleasant surprise. I also discovered that the Hardrock Boots
seem to be cut a bit larger over all. I have never found a boot that I can
comfortably fit my foot and hiking socks into that was smaller than a size 11.5, but I
have absolutely no difficulty in the size 11 Hardrock Boots.
So far I have worn the Hardrock Boots for three full days (8 hours +) to see how they feel
and if they need to be broken in. I always wear after market insoles in my hiking boots
and shoes, but so far, after 24+ hours in the Hardrocks, the Montrail insoles feel good
and my feet and legs feel even better. I don't know if this will hold out after some
serious trail use, but it is a good sign that I can stay on my feet all day in these boots
at this point without foot or leg pain. If these boots use the same Integrafit system that
the shoe version does, then this may explain why they feel so darned good on my feet.
According to Montrail the ." From where my feet are sitting/standing, this system
works great, especially considering that I very seldom feel great with straight off the
shelf shoes/boots of any sort.
Another thing that I have enjoyed so far is the way that the boots/soles feel. The
Hardrocks seem very stiff in the soles/bottom of the boots and I like this. Once again, if
the boots are similar to the shoe version, then they utilize a special TPU plate. Montrail
says that the "Full length TPU plate
protects the foot from rough terrain and provides support during long periods of running,
hiking and walking." Once again in my view, it appears that Montrail has done
their best to make a very comfortable and supportive boot.
Here are some questions that I plan on using as a guide for my
testing of the Montrail Hardrock Boots:
1. Can I put my own insoles into these boots?
2. How comfortable are these boots with and without my own insoles?
3. How water/element resistant is the boot?
4. How well do the Montrail Hardrock boots breathe? Hardrocks "Gryptonite GT sticky traction" sole?
Final thoughts:
The Montrail Hardrock Boots are very interesting at this point in the test. They seem to
combine all of the attributes of running shoes with a smaller, yet well chosen set of
hiking boot attributes in an attractive package. Best of all, at this point, they appear
really comfortable and supportive of my feet.

Putting on the boots:
The laces are good on these boots. The regular lace loops and speed lace loops are easy to
adjust. The boot strings are a little long, but the narrow rounded shape is great for
getting under the speed loops and staying put. After the first two months though, I
am going to have to burn the tips of two of lace ends because they are coming unraveled. I
don't think this is a lace durability issue, but more of a length issue. I have spent a
lot time stepping on the extra long laces so it is no surprise that the tips are wearing a
bit.
My aching feet:
For the past twenty years I have had to use after market insoles in every pair of shoes I
wear. This is everything I own from dress shoes all the way down to my hiking boots. If I
don't use after market insoles I get sore feet, sore knees, and a lower back that makes me
want to burn the shoes in question. The first thing I always do is try shoes/boots with
the stock insoles and then after a day or two of suffering, I drop in my real insoles.
At this point I have worn the Hardrock Boots for at least 30 days (some was casual
street wear) and I have yet to put in after market insoles. I did pull the Montrail
insoles out and found that they were normal, thin, stock insoles; in other words, nothing
special. With that in mind I have to rave about these boots. They are made in such
a way that my body loves them. There are no abnormal aches or pains to report and I am
really amazed after all the wear I have been putting on them.
The Montrail website lists these features for the Hardrock shoes (lows vs. the mids that I
have) "Dual density midsole for
midfoot support and pronation control and full length TPU plate protects the foot from
rough terrain and provides support during long periods of running, hiking and
walking."
I have more to say about
the TPU plate later, but right now the only thing I can figure is that the combination of
these two things are what make my feet love these boots. Apparently Montrail has designed
footwear that I can use without suffering or using after market insoles. I am stunned, but
appreciative.
Rocking in the Hardrocks:
One thing that became very apparent with these boots was the stiffness of the sole/boot
interface. I attribute this stiffness and lack of flex (mainly of the sole) to the full
length TPU plate. My first few days in these boots were either street wear or at the
ropes course where I work. At the ropes course I do a lot of climbing, belaying of
climbers and rappelling. The steps and staples are narrow metal that I normally feel
really well through soles of boots. The Hardrock soles were stiff and I didn't feel a
thing as I climbed or stepped steps, staples, or cables, which I really liked.
The TPU plate (and related sole stiffness) really impressed when when I was belaying
climbers. In regular hiking boots my feet have a tendency to roll side to side as I work
with lowering climbers. This is uncomfortable and rather dangerous because I constantly
have to watch my footing. The Hardrocks don't have the roll issues for me. The soles
are so stiff that the boot tends to rock front to back more (not bad, I really like this)
without any tendency to roll from side to side. That means less foot and ankle strain for
me.
I have done a few days of trail running (more to come) along a stretch of trail in the
local state forest. The trail varies from hard packed dirt to sand, with rocks, roots, and
sticks thrown in for fun. The heel to toe rock is noticeable to me when I am moving
quickly on varied terrain and once again I really like the feeling. The Hardrocks haven't
show a tendency to roll side to side in these situations either, which really makes me
feel better about my ankles, which always suffer when a boot or shoe lets my feet roll and
do bad things to my ankles. This heel to toe roll makes me feel almost as if I am gliding
along when I run in the Hardrocks. I have noticed that I spend a lot less effort
worrying about terrain and foot placement because the boots provide good and predictable
stability when I moving at a rather quick pace.
If I had to say one thing and only one thing about the Hardrocks at this point it would
probably be "The TPU plate rules." I just don't feel that I am doing justice to
how well these boots feel on my feet and how well they handle on the trail.
Fit and heat:
The temperatures have been rising here in Texas and as the mercury has risen the Hardrocks
have still been cool and comfortable. I requested a size 11.5 to accommodate my
hiking socks, but so far, the 11's have done just well with my normal hiking socks. The
toe box has plenty of room and the boot seems to breath really well. My feet don't get
squished or overheated. One thing that I am paying close attention to is that after
a few weeks of not washing hiking socks (don't ask) there was a nasty funk coming from the
Hardrocks. I washed socks and aired the boots for a couple of days and the stink has
gone, so hopefully that was just a sock/tester issue and not a Hardrock problem.
The sole of the matter:
One thing I have noticed about these boots is the fact that the soles haven't started to
wear too much. As a professed heel dragger and a general abuser of boot soles, I can
honestly say that the Hardrock soles have held up pretty darned well for as much as I have
worn them. I have also been impressed by the traction that the soles have provided.
With the stiffness that the TPU plate provides a sole that was too slick would have
cause me some serious traction issues, but as it stands, the soles are just the right
consistency for these boots.
Final thoughts:
I am impressed by these boots. They fit well, they wear well, and best of all they make my
feet feel really comfortable. The toe box has plenty of room for when my feet
expand, the arches hit my feet in just the right place, and the list goes on. I am
planning on putting many more miles on these boots and I am hoping that my initial results
are upheld by further use.

weight
Belaying/Rappelling: 3 days
Socks or not:
Over the last portion of this test I have spent at least 19 days in these boots doing a
wide variety of activities. One thing that I have varied as much as my outdoor activities
are the socks that I have used. I have used wool socks, synthetic socks, and cotton
socks. I have used liner socks and gone without. My goal was to make sure that I
hadn't lucked into a 'magic combo' with the Hardrocks and my favorite hiking socks that
resulted in the perfect comfort that these boots present to my feet when worn. No
matter what type of sock I wore with the Hardrocks, the boots were still comfortable.
The heat is on:
The temperatures have been horrible this summer. Almost every day has topped 90 F (32 C)
and I am happy with how well the Hardrocks vent no matter what type of socks I am wearing.
My feet do sweat, but they don't overheat in these boots and this is important. On a
side note, despite all the hot sweaty days, the boots have not picked up any nasty
odors. They do need aired out after a hot day on the feet, but other than that there is no
stink that has become permanent.
Comfort:
What I have really enjoyed about the Montrail Hardrocks is the fact that they are
comfortable. I realized that the lacing point that tightens the boots is directly over the
arch of my feet. The speed lacing points that are high up on the foot seem to be for
securing the laces and keeping debris out, but the real work takes place directly over the
arch. Being able to make the boots fit at that point on my foot lets me get the
laces tightened just right so that the boots don't slide around on my feet.
They are also the first boots or shoes in the last 15 years that have not required me to
use after market insoles because of my feet. I find this really amazing and as the test
progressed I just knew that I was going to eventually have to pop my after market insoles
into the Hardrocks, but that day never came. In fact, when my knee started bothering
me (hiking injury), it did curtail some of my planned usage of the Hardrocks, but they
were the only pair of shoes, boots, or sandals that I had that actually felt good to wear
when my knee was hurting. They were not a miracle cure by any means, but my feet liked
them and the beating that my knee seems to take when the injury flares up seemed to be
a lot less with the Hardrocks on my feet.
Final thoughts:
I put a lot of miles on the Hardrocks and if my knee hadn't given me problems I probably
would have put a lot more on them. I loved running on the trails in the local state park
in them and they provided a stable and reliable foundation for my feet on the trails.
As backpacking boots they were equally durable and comfortable. I usually carried
about 18 pounds (8 kg) in my pack when I wore the Hardrocks on extended hiking trips and
they were always comfortable and a pleasure to wear.
They have also turned out to be very durable. After four months of serious wear, they look
almost as good as the day they arrived. They are dusty, but other than that, they do
not appear to have been worn as much as they have. If I could just find a way to get
all the dust off, they would look brand new.
The stiff sole of the boot is one thing that I have really come to love. It makes running
and moving quickly in the Hardrocks very easy and I have not suffered through my feet
rolling side to side because the stiffness of the sole keeps this from happening.
The outer sole has also shown a great deal of durability. I am hard on soles because I
tend to drag my heels, but the Hardrocks actually seem to show what I consider to be less
than average wear on the heel area of the soles. I also like the way that the soles
shed mud/dirt. I encountered some mud and wet dirt during this test and the Hardrock soles
had no problem shedding excess material without gunking up. I never had to clean the soles
in order to improve traction or to get excess gunk off.
The laces also work great. The main pressure point for the
lacing system falls directly over the arch of my foot and the speed laces on the neck of
the Hardrocks tighten things up and keep debris out very well. I still think the
stock laces are a bit long, but that is nothing that be cured with scissors and a quick
snip.
Overall, these are boots that I will keep on wearing. They are comfortable no matter what
socks I wear, how hot it is, how fast I am moving, or how much of a load I am packing.
The toe box is just roomy enough without being too big and I think that a half
size larger than my normal shoe size is a better choice than the normal full size larger
that I normally wear in hiking boots.
The only thing I didn't get a chance to find out about is how well they handle water.
I am sure that at some point I am going to get them wet, but I wish that I had more
a chance to do that before this test series was over.

1. Stiffness of the sole
2. Comfort of the boot

There are some really bad children’s book covers out there. But most of those books aren’t exactly best-sellers…the real tragedy occurs when the cover is an insult to the text inside. Off the top of my head, here are two books that really don’t deserve their disastrous cover art.
First up: The Chosen by Chaim Potok. A character-driven story about friendship, fathers-and-sons and something you don’t often encounter in YA literature: in-depth discussions of Judaism.
Alas, the cover promises much boredom. You can’t go duller than brown on brown, and the kid doesn’t even look angsty. He just stares, slightly dreamy and contemplative, like a surveyor of mediocre art.
I’m a huge fan of the His Dark Materials series, so imagine my surprise when I saw the revamped Amber Spyglass. The original (American) cover captured the mystery and beauty of the kids’ journey. This one looks like a cheap thriller.
That spyglass resembles nothing so much as a sewage pipe—and why is Dust (the glittery bits) painted in psychedelic colors? Perhaps it’s an attempt to create “adult” covers for children’s books so commuters don’t feel ashamed about their subway reading. They did it with Harry Potter, but those were at least serviceable.
What do you think? Are there other great books cursed with shockingly bad covers?
How about the first two editions of LOTR? Trippy!
This one for I Capture the Castle has been bothering me for years:
Charming English romance, or shocking expose of a 1960s psychiatric facility?
Every edition of Fire & Hemlock, by Diana Wynne Jones. Story has love, heroics, mystery, and is awesome. The most recent cover appears to be for Jane Eyre. An old, unlikely to be read edition, at that! Previous covers were blah at best (tho better than current).
One of my favorite books as a kid was Buffalo Brenda by Jill Pinkwater. But the cover is TERRIBLE! In fact, when I picked up the book at the library, it was precisely because the cover was so ridiculous that I intended to learn more about the book in or to scoff at it (yes, I was snarky even as an 11-year-old).
Here’s my full review of the book, including a brief lament over the cover:
I have to nominate the hard-to-find book by Zilpha Keatley Snyder Below the Root as having had a terrible cover with its 1990’s reprint. I loved it when I discovered the 1970’s edition… that had an ink drawing of tangled forest. But the copy I just bought online looks awful! It is so terrible that I have not yet been able to convince my sons to read it, and that’s why I bought it :(
I added the cover at the end of my review so you can see the cover in its full pastel-and-lavender glory
Have you considered gluing a better picture over the cover? Or covering it in brown paper?
Thanks for all the suggestions! They’re indeed painful…we’ll be posting more terrible covers soon.Roger Ratcliff Gail McKoon Northwestern University
An important concept championed by Tulving ( 1974, 1983) is the notion that retrieval conditions are critical in assessing memory: Memory cannot be assessed independently of retrieval, and a theoretical description of memory cannot be formulated without specification of the retrieval environment. In this chapter, we illustrate the profound influence that this view has had on the development and testing of memory models, and we show how the cue dependent view has begun to have an influence on research concerned with text processing.
There is a new generation of memory models that are more ambitious than models that were developed in the 1970s (with the notable exceptions of HAM [ Anderson & Bower, 1973] and ACT [ Anderson, 1976]). The new models attempt to deal with a range of phenomena across experimental paradigms at a level of detail that in the past has been found only in extremely limited models designed for a single task. In this chapter, five models that vary in their commitment to cue-dependent retrieval are considered and evaluated on the dimension of encoding/retrieval interaction. In models dealing with recall and recognition, the treatment of results from the recognition failure procedure is described because these results provide serious problems for superficial accounts of recognition and recall. In the models that do not deal with recall and recognition, the treatment of cue-target interactions is discussed.
In the recognition failure procedure, pairs of words are studied and then the second member of a pair is tested; in one test, the second member is presented by
-73-SAN ANTONIO – Players and coaches have been instructed not to talk about it, so they could not comment on this, but former NBA referee Tim Donaghy’s book ‘Personal Foul: A First-Person Account of the Scandal that Rocked the NBA’ has found a publisher and is out just in time for Christmas.
Of note to Nuggets fans will be this passage, in reference to a Nuggets 93-67 loss in San Antonio in the last game of the 2003-04 regular season that was officiated by Donaghy along with Dick Bavetta. It is part of a longer excerpt posted on Deadspin.com not too long ago:
‘Two-game.’
MOE ON KIKI
On Friday night, Doug Moe watched a New Jersey Nets-Charlotte Bobcats game with a ton of interest and with knots in his stomach.
On one side he had his good friend Larry Brown. On the other he had a former player, Kiki Vandeweghe.
“I wanted Kiki to get a win,” Moe, the former Nuggets coach, said. “But I didn’t want Larry to lose.”
Brown did lose, and it was the Nets’ first win of the season after 18 straight losses to open the season. It was also Vandeweghe’s debut as coach of a team he has had a large hand in building. And though Vandeweghe has described himself as hesitant to take the job, Moe said don’t look for the former Nugget to look to jump back into the front office at his first chance.
“I don’t think so,” Moe said. “I think he is embracing the coaching job, and I think that he would like to stay in coaching if he does well enough. I think he’s kind of excited about it from the standpoint of seeing what he can do and see how things would work out.”
Vandeweghe played for the Nuggets from 1980-84. He was Nuggets general manager from 2001-06.
“I think Kiki will do well,” Moe said. “He knows the game, understands the game. I think his temperament is good. I think he’ll do good. It’s a very tough situation watching the game.”
Moe does not plan on giving coaching advice.
“No. Not in any capacity,” laughed Moe. “I won’t even talk to him and distract him. Those are things that he’ll… You know, you got to get your own feel for things. He’ll handle it.”
Chris Dempsey: cdempsey@denverpost.comBy been misunderstood, she said
“I’m not disappointed in it. I feel there’s going to be ups and downs in the market as we’ve all seen in the last year,” she said Friday. “I have faith in my advisors and I have faith that they’re doing the best for me that they can — faith in what they tell me.”
Baker handles the county’s investments at her sole discretion.
The county commission is responsible for approving contracts and serves in an advisory capacity, but has no authority over investments.
“We can’t tell the treasurer how to invest the county’s money,” said commission Chairman Bobby Sandoval. “The people elect her, and they elect her to do that job.”
Rob Burpo, the county’s investment advisor and owner of Albuquerque-based First American Financial Advisor Inc., is overseeing the account for the fund manager under contract with the county.
Burpo said even though the account statement, obtained Friday by the CNJ, shows a market value decrease, there wasn’t really a loss. Burpo said the account’s performance is being taken out of context.
And as of Thursday, Burpo said the account showed an $11,000 increase.
Burpo said there has been a lot of misunderstanding about the investment the county entered into in August and he hopes to clear it up at the special meeting.
“If you look at the portfolio on any one day, you see investments (fluctuate),” he said, explaining that is merely a snapshot of the account’s performance.
“That’s great if you’re a day trader, and that’s great if you’re trying to besmirch someone.”
Commissioners want answers
For months commissioners have been asking for updates on the fund.
“I have had concerns, from the onset, about the volatility of the Allegiance Capital Account and the amount of the management fees for this fund,” Commissioner Caleb Chandler wrote by e-mail Saturday.
Chandler has been the most vocal of commissioners on the subject since July, asking for information about the fund and its fees.
“I have not been satisfied with the information we have been receiving about the fund. I continue to have concerns and expressed those at commission meetings on Oct. 20, Dec. 1 and Dec. 15,” he said.
In four out of 4 1/2 months, the account showed a value decrease and paid 81 percent in management fees on its returns.
Traditionally, the county has taken a conservative approach to investing, holding its money in state and federal bonds and in certificates of deposit with local banks.
What’s in the fund
The portfolio, based on December’s statement, consists of almost $2.1 million invested in a combination of Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, U.S. Treasury notes and about $45,000 in a J.P. Morgan money market fund.
Burpo said the portfolio with Macquarie Allegiance was designed to beat the rate of return on a one-year treasury note, and he said it has done that.
Though Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac were certainly not a good investment in the recent past, Burpo said the government has guaranteed them and they are no longer risky.
Friday, U.S. Rep. Barney Frank, chairman of the Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac oversight committee, announced he will recommend doing away with the companies and has yet to decide what to do with the $5.4 trillion in mortgage bonds held by investors.
Market fluctuations
December had the largest rise in interest rates since 2004, bringing down the value of bonds, Burpo said, which led to the decrease.
Burpo said he is frustrated by skepticism about the account.
“It is worth more money that it started out. You can’t say that it has lost value … it was just a really bad bond market,” Burpo said.
Even though the December statement shows a total account value of $2,291,259, Burpo said there is accumulated interest held on bonds amounting to just over $11,800. He said if the bonds were sold, the accumulated interest would amount to a more-than $3,000 gain on the county’s investment.
But it’s money, Burpo said, “you don’t own until you get the check in the mail.”
County analysis
County Finance Manager Mark Lansford’s recent analysis concludes the county would have earned more money by investing in traditional CDs with local banks.
But Burpo said based on what he shows as an $8,000 gain thus far in January, Lansford’s report was “obviously wrong.”
“I’m anxious to hear Mr. Burpo’s explanation and if we cashed out today, what would we get,” Lansford said. “That’s the true value. Anything else is just paper; anything else is not actual value.”
The contract and fees
In July, Burpo said, the county commission approved a contract with Macquarie Allegiance Capital with the understanding the fund would keep money liquid. Burpo said this meant the county could capitalize on market improvements when they came about.
When Burpo was asked about the fees charged by the fund manager in July, he told the commission they would pay .26 percent of the account’s value to Macquarie Allegiance Capital, according to the July 7 meeting minutes.
Friday, Burpo said he acts as an intermediary for the account, overseeing it and working with the county, though he is not handling the money directly.
For that, he receives .40 percent of the account value in quarterly fees. Macquarie Allegiance Capital receives .26 percent quarterly for managing the fund, he said.
The fees being charged on the account are standard, Burpo said.
But commissioners said when they approved the contract, they were not aware Burpo would be paid a fee in addition to one charged by Macquarie Allegiance Capital.
“We were told 26 (basis points) at the commission meeting,” said Chandler. “I have asked to see a copy of the contract signed by the treasurer but, as far as I know, the commission has not been given a copy. I have not seen one. I had not been told that we were paying Burpo an additional 40 (basis points).”
Sandoval, too, said he does not recall there being a .66 percent management fee.
“I would question whether we really want to continue doing this, which I’m questioning anyway at this point,” he said.

Nope. The owner sure can be though. The rainbow sticker is a bit of a giveaway. Never put one on my bike, no place one would really fit.
These things matter in Utah.
Woman tend to display there preferences quicker than men, That stuff doesn't matter here. I personal wouldn't put stickers on my bike.
I think if you have a sticker that says "punk rock," it isn't.

A federal court judge has thrown out former Olympic figure skater Oksana Baiul’s $45 million libel and defamation lawsuit.
According to the New York Daily News, the “Queen of Ice” filed the suit against NBC Universal and Disson Skating for allegedly promoting her appearance in two ice shows that she did not participate in.
Baiul claimed that the use of her image at the shows in 2011 and 2012 damaged her reputation.
The New York Post reported that Manhattan Judge Katherine Forrest did not buy that argument and threw out the case on Thursday.
“To call Baiul’s arguments as to damages speculative is indeed charitable – she offers no credible evidence whatsoever that she has suffered or will suffer any compensate damages as a result of defendant’s alleged conduct,” Forrest wrote.
Baiul’s name was listed as participating in a press release to the media that’s used for TV listings after she backed out of the performances. However, both the network and Disson Skating deny promoting her appearance on the shows.
The 36-year-old Ukrainian figure skater won a gold medal in the 1994 Winter Games. So far, she is the only skater to win gold representing her country at the Olympics. explores the origins of the contemporary mass schooling models and redefines school learning in terms of labor, with special reference to genesis of education and to the history of childhood in its connection with schooling. Schools are described as islands of non-market, semi-feudal economies in the midst of the sea of markets, which explains some of the most common worries about learning motivation. The book offers several critiques of the most influential thoughts on schooling today: Progressivism, the Human Capital theory, the belief in intrinsic motivation, the voucher movement and the accountability reform. And finally, it outlines two alternative solutions for educational problems which stem from the essential lack of learning motivation. This book is an invitation to resurrect the tradition of asking fundamental questions about education. Improving what is essentially a flawed institution can take us only so far; the author is inviting the reader to go further.
Product DetailsSonography Principle and Instrumentation (SPI) test is a standardized test conducted by American Registry for Diagnostic Medical Sonography (ARDMS) for credentialing of sonography professionals. The sonography professionals who desire to get ARDMS credential require passing SPI examination and one of the specialty exams.
Eligibility-
This test is taken by sonography professionals and students for earning ARDMS credentials. They have to pass one of the specialty exams within five year period after passing SPI. The specialty exams of abdomen, breast, fetal echocardiography, neurosonology or obstetrics and gynecology lead to Registered Diagnostic Medical Sonographer (RDMS) credential. The specialty exams of adult echocardiography, fetal echocardiography or pediatric echocardiography lead to Registered Diagnostic Cardiac Sonographer (RDCS) credential. The specialty exam of vascular technology heads toward Registered Vascular Technologist (RVT) credential.
Test Overview-
SPI test examines knowledge of basic physical principles and instrumentation required by the ultrasound professionals. The content of this exam includes patient care, safety and communication (5% of test), physics principle (20% of test), Ultrasound transducers (20% of test), Pulse echo instrumentation (30% of test), Doppler instrumentation and hemodynamics (20% of test) and Quality assurance / quality control of equipment (5% of test).
The topics covered in patient care, safety and communication are “patient identification and documentation”, “patient interaction”, “emergency situations”, “universal precautions”, “verification of requested examination” and “Bio-effects and ALARA”. “Properties of ultrasound waves”, “Power, intensity and amplitude”, “interaction of sound with tissue” and “units of measurement” form the content of physics principles section. The Ultrasound transducers section covers topics like “transducer construction and characteristics”, “transducer types”, “special resolution” and “transducer selection”. The pulse-echo instrumentation section is based on knowledge of “display modes and their formation”, “transmission of ultrasound”, “reception of ultrasound”, “beam former”, “post processing of ultrasound signals”, “pulse-echo imaging artifacts”, “tissue harmonic imaging”, “recording and storage devices” and “real time ultrasound instrumentation”. The Doppler instrumentation and hemodynamics section tests ability to acquire color flow image, Doppler spectral image, take measurements from spectral waveform and knowledge of hemodynamics. The quality assurance/quality control of equipment section is based on know-how of preventive maintenance, malfunctions and performance testing with phantoms.
Test Format-
There are 120 multiple choice questions in test. The time allotted for administering SPI is 2 hours. This exam is administered in computer based testing mode. It is a criterion referenced exam, so the candidates are examined in respect to a set standard instead of, in respect to performance of other candidates.
Marking Scheme-
The examinees are awarded scaled scores ranging from 300 to 700. It needs a score of 555 or higher to pass this examination. Some of the questions in test are not scored, however these items are indistinguishable.
Schedule-
For taking this test, candidates have to apply online and create a password protected account. The applicants have option to pay examination fees online or send by mail. They require mailing all supporting documents to ARDMS. ARDMS verifies the documents and checks eligibility of a candidate to take the test. It sends a confirmation letter within two to four weeks from receiving documents and notifies 90 days period in which SPI test can be scheduled and taken. The candidates who fail in exam can retest after waiting period of 60 days.
Exam Fees-
The fee of SPI is $200 which includes non-refundable processing fee of $100. There is additional charge of $50 for international testing. This additional fee has to be submitted at the time of examination and could be changed without notice.Best Buy Fashion #9160

The reviews are in (“Amazing!”). The box office is off-the-charts good (108 million!). The trailers are stunning (Even his eye reflects bullets!). Bryan Singer has done it again! Superman Returns carries the industry on its back through the 4th of July weekend! You’ve GOT to see it!
So, here you are, on the delicate “second weekend.” Sure, sure, blockbusters are made or broken on the opening weekend. You don’t have to be a movie analyst or a filmwhore to know that these days. So, Superman is an unqualified success in industry terms...but now we have to see if it has legs. This baby cost over two hundred million (and that’s just what they’re reporting), and if it doesn’t carry its weight into the next couple of weeks you're gonna see a lot of money men paging through Variety for the International section. “We just made $20,000 in Manila!”
So, before you haul ass to the cineplex, the question is...is it THAT good? Let me preface this by saying that I love Bryan Singer. (You can see where this is going...) Not just because I think he handled both lofty expectation-filled X-Men movies with grace but with flair. They weren’t just “give me my bang for my buck!” spectacles but thoughtful with enough dimension that you felt you could justify eating your Frosted Flakes because basically they were sugar-coated Wheaties. It’s also because Bryan fought for his films and that quality. Rumor has it that Mr. Singer was fired numerous times on BOTH X-Men features because he refused to back down from what he thought they needed. No one surrounding or working on those films will tell a simple tale of grace and ease on the set (unless they are on Access Hollywood or they are Hugh Jackman who is unfazed by ANYTHING!). It was work and it was tense. Plain and simple.
He’s also remarkable because in person his demeanor is understated, unassuming, and present. Not the brazen ring-leader so many young directors feel they need to be to remind you of their “star quality” (see Bret Ratner references below). Bryan knows what people like to see because he has a fan's eye. He obviously loves movies. The Usual Suspects and its cinematic referential style should confirm that. SO...that being said...the answer is, unfortunately, no.
I’m not here to bring down Superman. Not the Lex Luthor of Kryptonian critics there to gouge the fatted hog of Hollywood. I think it’s great the box office is still muscling forth behemoths...it gives me hope. But it feels discernably like a step back for Mr. Singer and his grace with mega-expectation. (Even with going over budget again here...keep it up, Bry!) The movie feels oddly uninspired, all the while its fantastic images and score pound and shake the theater. The most striking moment in the film, for me, happened in its first few minutes, and it rarely if ever captured it again. The slightly mumbly, lispy and iconic voice of Marlon Brando as Superman’s father permeates the darkness. Brando...from beyond the grave, from childhood, from the original...here again, to herald in a new version. My goodness, I was stunned and I even knew it was coming. He had me. Bryan is no fool, he needed that gravitas to get us on board for what is to follow. Yet the very brilliance in using this gift is at the core of what’s wrong with the film.
Superman Returns is neither a re-invention of the franchise nor a continuation. It is an homage whether intended or not. Its cinematic predecessor is more Gus Van Sant’s re-enacting of Psycho than last year's inspired Batman Begins. One has the feeling that Mr. Singer “really liked” the Superman movies growing up and didn’t want to change them but “sure did want to make one.” Which, at its very essence, is what cuts this film down from its great heights of possibility and makes it more a cinematic wax museum of good intentions. It is the laborious honoring of its predecessors that mires the heart of the film in languid pictorial detachment.
Much was made of the casting of the young lead, Brandon Routh, as the Man of Steel. Simply because he had few credits that would merit such stunt casting. Apparently, Bryan hand-picked the kid for greatness. So much so, he reportedly had to buy him clothes so that he would be suitably dressed for interviews. Having seen the film, there can be no question on how/why Mr. Routh booked this role. There are many uncanny moments when you can eerily feel Christopher Reeve just seeping through his delivery. I would not hesitate to doubt that Bryan had Routh glued to his DVD player watching Reeve's moments and absorbing the very lilt of his voice. None more evident then in his guise of Clark Kent. Even the goofball grin and adjustment of his glasses is to the point precision of Reeves. So much so, one has to admire Routh for such a thorough study. Yet, again, where the homage falls short is locating the actor's or director's own voice in all this nostalgia.
The reference to last year's parallel comic book re-invention is unavoidable again: Batman Begins, with all its Joseph Campbell and dark, Nietzschean heart, thrives because it dares to have its own voice. Damn the consequences. Yet, even it hobbled at times when it came to the protagonist's counterpart. For some reason comic book adaptations struggle to find a woman equal to the task of her own ferocity of conviction, yet tender-hearted enough to need saving (regardless of the amount of qualified actresses out there). Katie Holmes struggled against baby-faced precociousness to be taken seriously as a determined, philanthropic lawyer. (Hey, if Elizabeth Shue can invent cold fusion in The Saint, I guess we can wash this down with the same stupid juice.) Not to be outdone by Kate Bosworth as Lois Lane, all pouty and stammering that she won the Pulitzer (yes, the Pulitzer) on an article she now regrets titled, “Why the World Doesn’t Need Superman” (also a surname for this article, apparently). Again, I like Kate Bosworth, but I do not think she’s Cate Blanchett, either.
The movie is not without its considerable merits. The action sequences are seamless in their execution. Gone from the original is any feeling of blue screen or the sense that this guy is being elevated by wires into the air. They are fast and abrasive and as honest as you could hope for in a movie about a guy in tights. But, more importantly, it is here that Singer tries to infect the film with some vision and depth. One can see the visual sculpting and care the director has put into telling the story and why Singer isn’t just gifted with characters but with storytelling finesse. The references to Greek mythology are numerous in these sequences. Superman falling from the sky like Icarus. Superman, like Atlas, carrying the world on his back. Or, when Kevin Spacey as Lex Luthor, starts his pursuit of power by comparing himself to Prometheus and his desire to steal the fire form the gods. Points for style, again, but without the heart pumping beneath them they are simply ideas.
One wonders how much of the decision to shoot this film came from Mr. Singer's constant fights with the studio over the X-Men franchise. Apparently, with more success comes more friction rather than the opposite (go figure). I have not yet forced myself to see the third installment of the mutant franchise since it changed hands with Bret Ratner at the helm (emphasis on the second syllable). Something seemed rotten from the get-go when Singer signed off on a successful run and then, in similar fashion, Matthew Vaughn mysteriously removed himself after being hired from the job. Matthew Vaughn was the first-time helmer of the Brit-indie Layer Cake and X3 would have been a huge step for the film-maker who had “undisclosed reasons” for leaving the job vacant. Enter the director of Money Talks, Rush Hour, and After the Sunset. Okay. He, too, didn’t want to disrupt the already successful franchise and the great work Singer had already done. Fantastic. One wonders the motivations, besides youthful endearment, Singer had for taking on this pre-conceived Super-franchise. It is well known that the project had been lingering in desperate development for years with rumored connections to Nicholas Cage starring to Kevin Smith writing and directing. One wonders if it was a convenient place to hide.
Before the movie opened I was on an island (not figuratively...) shooting my own epic disappointment. The director, who knew my fascination with Mr. Brando, rushed over to me upon arriving to set with this “great Brando story” (I sort of collect them). Apparently his friend is a visual effects animator and was working on Superman Returns for some time. His job? To recreate Marlon Brando as accurately as possible so that he seamlessly fits into the film as another actor. This man studied and recreated Brando’s performance from original using unused out-takes and footage never seen. The result is supposedly startling and, according to him, disturbing.
“Doesn’t that scare you? As an actor that they can do that?” No. Why? Because somewhere a group of people probably spent millions of dollars and hundreds of hours recreating the performance of a man who was working at best at a fifth of his talent. Yet, the indelibility of his presence is profound. Which is at the source of where Superman Returns stumbles over its own weight of potential. A lot of talented people honoring something that is gone while leaving their own legacy behind.

Todd,
Nice review. I haven't been able to force myself to go see this movie, and will likely hold off until it comes out on cable.
I have been able to hold off, despite the onrushing Hollywood Hype Machine leading up to its release (the same Machine that snagged me into seeing Pirates this past weekend--so I'm by no means immune to the powers of the Machine), primarily because I did like the performances of Christopher Reeve in his first couple of Superman movies--as a kid.
Now the appeal of Superman as a character is also lost on me. Perhaps it is simply growing up and realizing that the character of Superman is too perfect, that there is no real challenge to him, since his only weakness, his only fault, lies in his vulnerability to a simple element-Krypton.
I guess my heroes now have to have a few more flaws in them to be all that appealing anymore. The more those flaws are based on quirks of personality and reflect the struggles of basic human existence, the better.
I've seen and admired both of the first X-Men movies, a franchise and a brand that both harder to capture on film and yet more interesting to film than the Superman franchise can ever be, so I do like Singer's work there.
I am glad to have read your review prior to seeing the movie, and will now do so with far lower expectations in the comfort of my home in a few months, if I ever do see it.
Finally, glad to see your work here on the Ionarts blog.
Take care,

Good to hear from ya, D. Thanks for the feedback. It's fun, ain't it?
-TIt would be a crime to waste this fine weather, so there was nothing for it but to get out on the water. Living here in Limerick, we have so much beauty on our doorstep, it’s never more than an hour’s work to get out there and enjoy the wonders of nature.
Today’s plan was to head for the Cliffs of Moher, but unfortunately, due to mechanical problems, we had to cut the journey short. Feckin mechanical problems are a pain in the arse, but not to worry. Let’s launch the boat at Tarbert instead. We’ll head for Scattery Island, have a stroll around and on the way home maybe catch a few mackerel for the dinner if this fancy new fish-finding gadget works properly. We might even bump into some of the many dolphin who inhabit the estuary. Who knows?
Here we go. There’s Scattery Island coming up. The last resident left in 1969 and now the homes of the old families are falling into ruin. Not only that, but the ancient monks who built the original monastic settlements are as dead as disco. I bet you don’t know that this uninhabited island in the Shannon estuary still has a bishop.
Yep. Scattery Island is a titular diocese and its titular bishop is Frank Caggiano, an auxiliary bishop of Brooklyn.
Frank’s parents moved to Brooklyn from, of all places, Caggiano, Salerno. He joined the priesthood and now he’s the bishop of Scattery.
Who knew?
Bada-bing, bada boom.
How did its name come about? Like almost every placename in Ireland, it’s an anglicisation of the original Irish. Inis Cathaigh was transliterated to Inishcathy. That in turn became Iniscattery and eventually Scattery, losing all its original meaning.
It has an interesting history: this is where the Shannon estuary pilots lived, the people who safely guided ships past the treacherous shoals, sandbars and rocks that threatened the lives of many an honest sailor. The old families made a good living from this ancient trade, and it’s said that even during the awful events of the Great Famine, nobody on the island went hungry. The old graveyard is testament to this: as we wandered around among the graves from the 1840s, it struck me that these were not the burials of poor people, but of the well-to-do, by the standards of the time. Hand-carved headstones, family vaults and a general feeling of prosperity through the generations. But nothing is free of tragedy. Every fourth stone records some young man lost at sea, or a few children who died “at a young age”.
Life might have been more secure on Scattery than it was on the mainland, but it was still hard.
There’s an ancient monastic settlement on the island, founded by Saint Senan in the 5th century. Senan is still a common first name in the locality, all the way from Kilrush to Labasheeda (Leaba Síoda — the bed of silk). The tourist people have painted up a couple of the cottages and built a visitor centre which was closed when we got there, but they seem to keep the place nice and tidy. All the grass is close-mown, something the ancient monks would hardly have done, given the acute shortage of petrol lawnmowers and electricity in the 5th century.
They built one of the first round towers with a fatal design flaw, though of course they could hardly have known that the Vikings would come charging up the river in their longboats four hundred years later.
What was the flaw? Well, most round towers don’t have a door at ground level. This one, for example, not too far away, in North Clare. See the height of the door? That’s to keep Vikings out and hopefully keep pillaging to a minimum.
Senan, I’m afraid, being a trusting sort, built his tower like this.
Not great for keeping the Vikings out. By the way, have a good look at that picture. Notice how the quoin-stones, the carefuly-cut cornerstones of the walls have been removed.
Was that the Viking? No.
Was it the evil English landlords? No.
Who then?
Why, none other than the Irish parish priests of the 19th century, stealing them for their new churches.
Isn’t the colour nice? That’s not a characteristic of the stone, I was informed by my infinitely-knowledgeable companion, but a kind of of lichen that thrives in clean air.
What a lovely place.
Inis Cathaigh was part of the Viking settlement of Limerick, and this was where the legendary king Brian Boru killed the tyrant Ivar, last Norse king of the city-state of Limerick in 977, together with his two sons. All very Game of Thrones.
No other invaders sailed up the Shannon, apart from the Normans and the English, but in the late 18th century the British administration became extremely nervous about Napoleonic forces and created a number of artillery batteries to pound the hell out of intrusive flotillas, much as the Turks did to the British forces at the Dardanelles in 1915.
They built gun emplacements at six locations: Kilcreadaun Point, Doonaha, Kilkerrin Point, Carrig Island, Tarbert Island and Scattery.
The Scattery position is extraordinary. It’s a massive redoubt , built of clean-cut ashlar stone with a moat all round it twelve feet deep. The walls are battered to deflect cannon-balls and it’s reached only by a bridge, formerly a drawbridge, with a portcullis to keep out attackers. There are six gun emplacements outside it, heavily dug-in, and in the one that’s been exposed, you can see the channel carved into the stone base for traversing the cannon.
These were huge 24-pounder guns. In the absence of any photography from the Napoleonic Wars, due to the fact that there were no cameras and no photographic technology, here’s an example from the American civil war. This is one seriously dangerous cannon. You didn’t want to be out there in the narrow river with people firing this thing at you. Even more, you didn’t want a fort firing six of them at you, simultaneously.
The block-house is described as bomb-proof and besides its killing loop-holes, it had mounted two howitzers on its roof.
Even today, you would not lightly decide to storm this thing, unless you had air support, which didn’t exist in the 18th century. You might even call it impregnable, unless the attackers were prepared to expend unlimited resources, which is never an option in warfare.
Look at this.
Happily, the Scattery battery never had to kill anyone, since the Napoleonic forces found more pressing errands, much to the disappointment of some locals who hoped to benefit financially from their intervention. Meanwhile, the labouring man continued breaking rocks and cared not a jot which wealthy individual, whether Irish, French or British, oppressed him.
Time to go, boys.
This has been a great day out. Sadly, the fish finder fails to reveal great shoals of mackerel, so there’s going to be no delicious freshly-fried fish.
Will we catch this fellow on a line with a rod? I think not. Nor would we want to.

You know, your occasional posts about history and places are so interesting, that I would like to read them in a book.
Apart from finding a suitable publisher, unfortunately writing for printed media usually takes out the fun of a story and often the fun of writing it. Too many people with too many commercial demands involved etc.
Know that from own experience (I write travel books, among others…).
But thank you all the same for these insights in lesser known histories and places. Great pics, too, with an eye for details.
Good article Bock, thanks. Did something similar a few weeks ago and visited Clonmacnoise, 40 years after my last visit. Sometimes we forget how lovely parts of this island are.
Scattery Battery Flattery!
Bishop Frank looks a bit of all right.. is he happy in his role I wonder?
Silly question here, but if “the last resident left in 1969″, who is Frank bishoping to? The birds?
I don’t know if a bishop needs to bishop to anyone.
Oh right, just as well really I suppose..
I wonder is Scattery island like Tony Soprano’s retired uncle’s farm?
Great post, your High & Mighty Bockness.
Thoroughly enjoyed your trip, Bock. : )
Loved reading this and seeing the pictures..well done
Outstanding piece Bock, I learned more in the 10 minutes reading this, than I have in the last couple of days. (oh, that sounds a bit sad doesn’t it lol)
Being local I knew this but you have put across the info in a really entertaining wAy and I really enjoyed reading it
Very well done, Bock. FYI: this Caggiano fellow just got himself appointed (31 July 2013) as bishop of the diocese of Bridgeport Connecticut.
At least the diocese of Scattery Island doesn’t have to worry about its children getting touched…A drop request must be made over the phone or in writing

So what does this experienced mom say about hospital births versus home births?.
What do you think of home births? Has your family ever experienced one?
26 Comments: Click Here to Add Yours:
I LOVE home births. I had a home birth in August of 2010. After having delivered my first child in a hospital delivering my second in a home birth was AWESOME! It was the most AMAZING experience ever! So awesome to see my body perform in the way God designed it to. Such a beautiful thing!
I truly believe that most women are being cheated out of this wonderful, beautiful experience of birth the way God intended when they go with the flow of society and give birth in a hospital with all of the drugs and forced "positions" and forced deliveries. Most women simply do as their Dr. says without asking questions and educating themselves.
I desire to see more women educate themselves on pregnancy and birth and to realize that they have options and that they do not have to do everything the doctor says or recommends.
I desire for them to see and know that their bodies were wonderfully and beautifully made to give birth and that there is nothing to fear. They CAN do this! And they can do it without drugs, without fear and even without pain!
Our first baby was born at home six weeks ago. It was amazing, as Michelle said I was up and about a few hours later and my recovery was so easy! Our baby is so alert and healthy from having a totally natural birth too. We will definitely have the rest of our babies at home if possible.
My three children were all born at the hospital, and I'm very thankful for that. All of the births had complications, and being at home would have been life-threatening in two of the three cases. I'd have any future babies at the hospital because of that. If I'd had a number of straight forward births, then maybe I'd attempt it. I'd love to be able to relax at home with out all the hospital noise and interruptions.
I think home births are a wonderful option for low risk moms! After a hospital birth with our first baby last year, my husband and I plan to deliver our second baby at home in a few months =)
Homebirths are always awesome for those for whom everything turns out fine. For those who have a life threatening situation for mom or baby and have a sad ending, it's not awesome. I think it's up to each woman along with her husband to make an educated wise choice. The majority of home births turn out well.
I had six children, all in a hospital setting. The hospital we chose is known for a home like setting with as little intervention as possible yet with all modern medical technology steps away. For us, that made the most sense.
We had our first home birth last year after 4 c-sections. Before we decided to have a vba4c, we took time to educate ourselves, took a vbac class, and then found a midwife who was willing to help us. Most importantly, we prayed for the vbac and felt total peace about it. It turned out amazing! It was a 2 hour labor, so the midwife didn't make it in time and my awesome husband had the honor of delivering our daughter. It was peaceful. It wasn't an emergency. It just happened. We knew God was there leading us through it all and we rested in that.
If any one was ever considering doing a vbac, especially at home, I would recommend taking a vbac class first. We know several doulas that hold these classes. Also, know your legal rights. A good place to start with that is.
Lastly & most importantly, PRAY! Go with what Jesus is telling you.
We are 17 weeks pregnant with our seventh child. We are excitingly planning a second home vbac after 4 c-sections. We humbly give all the Glory To GOD!
Blessings,
Jerene
I love homebirths! After 5 hospital births, including a c-section for a transverse baby, and a "forced" unnecessary repeat c-section due to a VBAC ban at the hospital, I had our 6th baby at home.
It was a few hours of labor when I delivered 10 lb 9 oz Oliver James at just shy of 42 weeks.
I am pregnant again, and unfortunately, the new midwife licensing law has made it illegal in the state of Idaho for a midwife to attend my birth. I am likely going to utilize a CNM in neighboring WA to attend my birth, God willing.
The only other choices are driving an hour away for a VBA2C hospital birth at a VBAC supportive hospital in WA as I did with our 5th, or unassisted. A c-section is out of the question, since it is not necessary for me.
Love the blog and the post..I'm a new follower.
God Bless!
My husband and I have 4 children. The first two were hospital births and the 3rd and fourth were born at home. While my hospital births were fine and uneventful, my homebirths were absolutely amazing. Of course if anything were to be risky I would opt to go to the hospital. I would never want to risk anyones life just to get my own way but as long as everyone involved is healthy I plan to deliver any future babies at home too. It was wonderful to be at home in my own clothes and my own everything with no strangers or rules. It was great to be able to allow my body to go at it's own pace and do what God designed it to do all on it's own. I know there are always exceptions and Drs and Hospitals have saved many lives but I really think the majoritay of women are being cheated because they are made to doubt their bodies and their own strength and unfortunately many modern interventions that are offered to help women cause more problems than they help. God has given us amazing bodies that are capable of more than we imagine:)
I had a natural birth in the hospital...thankfully I had an awesome nurse to support me. With my second, I had the same plan, but, unfortunately, didn't have such an awesome nurse, who by the way, actually encouraged me (in not so many words) to get an epidural. (Holly...I agree w/ you)
I think a home birth would be great in the sense that you can take your time with everything and labor however you want, however, I did like the "safe" feeling of the hospital in case something were to go wrong (monitors, equipment if necessary, etc.) It can be a tough decision!
I feel sorry for Anna. She didn't just have a homebirth, she gave birth on her toilet with cameras rolling. That is NOT modest, it is actually offensive to watch this young woman in pain on the toilet. Before that she had to go to New York 9 months pregnant to babysit Michelles kids then she had to travel across with world with a newborn and a toddler and march in a parade. It makes my back hurt just watching her.
I was enjoying these comments and blog post until I came upon Long Time Viewer's view. =/ Cheer up. :)
Anna gets paid.
Anna didn't HAVE to allow them to tape that.
Anna didn't have to go to New York.
For pity sakes, Anna didn't have to marry a Duggar that goes on tv.
Anna chose to do all these things.
:)
I agree on one thing, I was surprised the modest Duggars showed the toilet birth as I was how they showed Anna's first birth so graphic. Little children watch the Duggars. Bad decision. However... it's their choice to air it on tv and not mine. I may not agree but if I watched it.... what can I really say?
Long time viewer...I can relate to your comment (it seems like the episode of Michael's birth has been somewhat controversial because of the reasons mentioned), and although labor & birth are definitely "real" moments, a part of life and how God made it, personally I think it could've been edited a little better (maybe not actually showing the "toilet scene")...at any rate, in my opinion, Mackynzie's birth was very well done-I think if Michael's would have been filmed in a similar way it would have been better received.
I followed Josie's birth and your family's struggles with her.
My daughter's step granddaughter gave birth to a tiny little one 2 weeks ago.
She did really well until this past Friday.
Little Jozalen weighed 1 lb 12 oz and was 13 in long at birth.
This morning they operated on her and found she had 2 holes in her bowels. They are continuing massive antibotics but do not give the family a lot of hope.
Please keep them in your prayers
Thanks,

Hi Pat!

All of my bio kids have been born at home. We're planning another water birth for blessing #8 in six weeks. It's such a peaceful way to give birth.
I am 5 weeks pregnant with my first baby!!! I am planning on a homebirth with a local midwife. I am so excited beyond words. I am also filled with other emotions, but it is so encouraging to hear the positive comments about home birth. I actually have never met someone who had a home birth and didn't like it. Holly, your comment boosted my enthusiasm for a home birth! I CAN do this, without drugs, without fear, and without pain! My home birth will be around early next July!
My Mum had 3 home births in the UK then moved to Canada in th emid 60's where it was not an option-she HATED the hospital births!
When we had our 3 kids it wa snot an otpion where we lived(lots of scary threats about prosecution). If I knew then what I know now I might have taken my chances! I had 2 awful Dr led births and a wonderful midwife birth! Plus 2 out 3 kids came home with a cold and neither my Dh nor my family had one in the 2 weeks before the birth nor after so someone in th enursery gave colds to my kids!
You said something about Anna's birth not being "modest" I know the Duggars are all about modesty but, you can't have a baby and be wearing a dress down to your ankels. I do think they should have cut that scene out but, your right, it was her choice to be filmed, and I totally respect her for that.
Oh! I hope people are reading my comment! I HIGHLY recommend watching The Business of Being Born. It is an incredible documentary that explains why home birth is such a beautiful, healthy and NATURAL way to go! Lilly and Ellie, PLEASE pass this word along to Jim Bob and Michelle, and Joshua and Anna. Although I'm sure they already know the joys behind home birthing, this documentary is so incredibly insightful.
Hi Duggars!!!!!
I'm writing from Puerto Rico and I love all of you in the love of God!!!! Right now I'm expecting my second child and I want to know what is the name of the method Michelle used to prepare for the labor. during my first child pregnancy I took a prenatal course to handle my labor pain, but didn't work. I want to try something different so my labor experience could be much easier and to enjoy the greatest give God can give to a woman and husband, to born a a child. Thanks a bunch and God bless you all!!!!!
Hi Duggars:
I'm writing from Puerto Rico and I love you all in the love of my beloved God!!!! The reason I write to you is because I'm pregnant of my second child and I want to know the method Michelle used to minimized the pain through the labor process. I saw in some episodes of your reality show when practice and i want to do it so i can have a better labor process. I remember when I was pregnant of my first child I took some prenatal courses on how to manage the pain and the whole process, but didn't work and i want to try something different to have a more enjoyable process during the most wonderful experience God can give to a woman and husband, the born of a blessed child. Thanks a bunch and God bless you all!!!!!
Edith...Michelle and Anna used the Bradly method.
that's cool
I have had both of my babies with midwives at a birthing center on a hospital campus. I really enjoyed the security of knowing my baby and I had quick access to all medical care, while also having the calm, homey feel.
I am always a little sad for the moms who describe their birthing experience at hospitals as victims. It has been my understanding that medical staff encourage communication, including accepting a written birthing plan (drawn up by the mama) to help communicate the mama's expectations before, during, & after the birth.
Sometimes surprises happen, and so changes to the plan have to be made for health of mama and baby.
But, truly, there's loads of options than just 1. A happy birth at home and 2. A manipulated and forced birth at an uncaring hospital. Sheesh. Just communicate, be honest, and be grateful for this modern world of medicine we have access to! :o)
Heidi, where did you birth? City and state please. South Carolina and Pennsylvania (the states I've lived in) as well as many others in the US have made birthing centers illegal or enacted laws too strict to follow. I too had a horrifying hospital experience. My birth plan was scoffed at, I was verbally abused... it was very damaging. But I thank the Lord for my healthy baby boy most of all!
Hannah Bliley, Pennsylvania has birth centers? I don't know why you said they are.In 2006, the City University of New York kicked off an effort to double its number of science, technology, engineering, and mathematics graduates by 2015, dubbing the ten years to follow its “Decade of Science.” Pursuing this ambition, the university tapped KPF and Flad Architects to design a new multidisciplinary research facility with laboratories, classrooms, faculty and administrative offices, and a cafe on its south campus in Harlem. Now nearing completion, the Advanced Science Research Center (ASRC) features two glass-clad facing towers connected by a below-grade space that is topped by an intensive green roof. Altogether, the complex comprises 400,000 square feet. A future phase of construction will add another 200,000 square feet.
KPF, which also designed the master plan of CUNY’s south campus, arranged the two towers on a north-south axis, maintaining the college’s main circulation corridor and maximizing the ridgetop site’s spectacular views of Manhattan. This arrangement also allowed the designers to orient the buildings toward St. Nicholas Boulevard and keep a 200-foot distance from the existing structural biology building—a necessary step considering that excavating and driving piles for the new structures threatened to disrupt the sensitive equipment involved in that program’s ongoing experiments. As it was, digging out the foundation, an operation that involved carving through bedrock, took an entire year to complete.
The structural steel-framed towers themselves are each laid out on two distinct plans: rectangular volumes based around an ideal flexible module for lab spaces and more fluid, curvy volumes that house social spaces, offices, and meeting and break rooms. The curvy volumes, which are expressed by the building’s facade, look out onto the complex’s central green. The shared space below the green contains the facility’s more sensitive, vibration-prone equipment, including a vivarium, imaging facilities, and a loading dock.
Materially, the two towers relate to each other. Each building’s base is clad in rusticated gneiss stone. Though it comes all the way from China, the designers picked this material because it most closely resembles the Manhattan schist that makes up the majority of City College’s historic Gothic Revival campus. Manhattan schist itself is no longer available as a building material.
Above this green-gray-white stone base, the towers are clad with a unitized low-e glass, structurally glazed curtain wall. The curtain wall has three distinct expressive zones. The curving sections that shelter the offices are made up of modules, 2 feet 6 inches wide by 16 feet high (the buildings’ average floor-to-floor height is 16 feet), that simulate the sinuous form without requiring the cost-prohibitive measure of curving the glass itself. Half the height of each module is vision glass, while the remainder is a medium-gray shadow box spandrel. The vision sections feature 10-inch-deep vertical glass fins that protrude from the wall’s 4-inch aluminum mullions. The fins feature vertical white line fritting that helps cut down on glare and heat loading. The tips of the fins are cut like prisms to catch the light and create a rainbow effect across the facade.
The orthogonal lab blocks are clad with 5-foot-wide modules that feature a gradient of white line fritting that goes up the vision panel from 30 percent to 50 percent to 80 percent. These sections of wall also feature the shadow box spandrel with a reveal expressing the floor line. At the north and south ends of the towers, the cladding shelters meeting rooms and vertical circulation spaces. Here the curtain wall features a 50 percent white line frit. The architects designed the glazing in close collaboration with the engineers, Cosentini (MEP) and LERA (structural). Lab buildings are notorious energy hogs due to the massive amounts of ventilation required to maintain a healthy, sterile environment. In order to achieve the building’s LEED Silver target, KPF kept upping the density of the curtain wall’s fritting, cutting down as much as possible on the solar heat gain. Their efforts were not in vain, as the facility is now on track for LEED Gold.
At the top of the towers yet another facade system takes over, a painted aluminum louvered cladding system. It conceals the buildings’ robust exhaust fans and features acoustical properties that cut down on the noise produced by these workhorses, a neighborly gesture that will help the residents of the campus’ nearby dormitory catch some much needed shut-eye, whether by day or night.news

The Legislature is now on recess for two weeks, and by the time lawmakers return, it will likely be too late to approve and organize a new vote.
Sens. Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama also would have to sign off on the plan.
Obama's camp had expressed concern with the proposal, and Clinton blamed him for holding up the revote.
Michigan and Florida held primaries in January, but the Democratic National Committee stripped them of their delegates for scheduling their contests too early.

“Why truly, brother—my lord, if one there be can twang a lusty bow and hath a cool and soldier-like head ‘tis Jenkyn o’ the Ford, and after him Walcher, and after him—”
“Jenkyn, do you henceforth look to our archers. Are these matters heard and known among ye?”
“Aye!” came the thunderous answer.
“’Tis well, for mark me, we go out to desperate doings, wherein obedience must be instant, wherein all must love like brothers, and, like brothers, fight shoulder to shoulder!”
Now came there certain of the citizens to Beltane, leading a great and noble war-horse, richly caparisoned, meet for his acceptance. And thus, ere the moon rose, equipped with lance and shield and ponderous, vizored casque, Beltane, gloomy and silent, with Sir Fidelis mounted beside him, rode forth at the head of his grim array, at whose tramp and jingle the folk of Belsaye shouted joyful acclaim while the bells rang out right joyously.
CHAPTER XXXVIII
OF BELTANE’S BLACK AND EVIL MOOD, AND HOW HE FELL IN WITH THE WITCH OF HANGSTONE WASTE
It was very dark upon the forest road, where trees loomed gigantic against the pitchy gloom wherein dim-seen branches creaked and swayed, and leaves rustled faint and fitful in the stealthy night-wind; and through the gloom at the head of his silent company Beltane rode in frowning thought, his humour blacker than the night.
Now in a while, Sir Fidelis, riding ever at his elbow, ventured speech with him:
“Art very silent, messire. Have I angered thee, forsooth? Is aught amiss betwixt us?”
Quoth Beltane, shortly:
“Art over-young, sir knight, and therefore fond and foolish. Is a man a lover of self because he hateth dishonour? Art a presumptuous youth— and that’s amiss!”
“Art thou so ancient, messire, and therefore so wise as to judge ’twixt thy hates and loves and the abiding sorrows of Pentavalon?” questioned Fidelis, low-voiced and gentle.
“Old enough am I to know that in all this world is no baser thing than the treachery of a faithless woman, and that he who seeketh aid of such, e’en though his cause be just, dishonoureth himself and eke his cause. So God keep me from all women henceforth—and as for thee, speak me no more the name of this light wanton.”
“My lord,” quoth Sir Fidelis, leaning near, “my lord—whom mean you?”
“Whom should I mean but Mortain Helen—Helen the Beautiful—”
Now cried Sir Fidelis as one that feels a blow, and, in the dark, he seized Beltane in sudden griping fingers, and shook him fiercely.
“And dare ye name her ‘wanton!’” he cried. “Ye shall not—I say ye shall not!” But, laughing, Beltane smote away the young knight’s hold and laughed again.Popular Christian rock band MercyMe resumed their touring schedule Monday evening nearly three days after a car hit into their tour bus, killing two teens and the fetus of the pregnant driver.
Before beginning the concert at the Wisconsin State Fair in West Allis, Wis., seven miles east of Milwaukee, MercyMe frontman Bart Millard addressed the crowd on behalf of the band, expressing their “heartbreak” for the families in Ft. Wayne, Ind., and their desire to pray for the families and for the young lady who still remains hospitalized.
“The crowd joined the band in prayer specifically praying for healing, comfort, peace and understanding,” the award-winning band reported Tuesday. “We thank all of you for continuing to pray.”
According to The Associated Press, police in Fort Wayne were told by witnesses that MercyMe’s tour bus was going through a green light around 1:15 a.m. Saturday when a car carrying 18-year-old Kara Klinker and her passengers – 19-year-old Dario L. Boutte and 17-year-old Barbara R. Schmucker – made a left turn in front of it.
Fort Wayne police officer Liza Thomas told AP that the two passengers in the car died and that the driver, who was 35-weeks pregnant, was in critical condition after losing her baby.
On Tuesday, MercyMe said they have been in continued communication with the chaplaincy programs at the Ft. Wayne Police Department and Parkview Hospital, where Klinker remains in critical condition. The band said their thoughts and prayers continue to be with everyone affected by the situation.
“MercyMe would like to thank everyone for the overwhelming support and prayers that have been said not only for them, but for the families affected by this tragic accident,” the six-man group stated.
The band will next be performing at the Indiana State Fair in Indianapolis Wednesday before heading over to Cypress, Texas, where they are slated to appear on Aug. 21.
Their appearance in St. Louis, which they skipped Saturday as a result of the accident, has been rescheduled for Sept. 5.- Fund Type: Open-End Fund

Trade Show Leads: The Essential Ingredient A fishbowl filled with business cards is what most companies bring home from trade shows. The sales people may go fishing in the fish bowl to find a recognizable name or two, but for the most part the business cards are worthless. They are worthless because they have no meaning. How do you value one business card over the other? If you have 100 business cards should you call every one? If you are a busy sales person chances are about 100% that you have better things to do than cold call names from a fishbowl. What salespeople want are qualified leads. A qualified lead generally means that the lead represents a real sales opportunity. The lead shows interest, has money, is ready to buy, etc. However, in order for a lead to be qualified it first has to be qualifiable. A qualifiable lead is the essential ingredient for a lead. It is the 5-10 attributes that will allow you to rank-order the lead in terms of potential sales opportunity. I used to work in the college admissions industry. We sold lead-generation services to colleges. The best potential customer was the dean of admissions at a mid-size, private liberal-arts college in the Midwest that already used the Internet for recruiting students. The worst potential customer was a lowly admissions counselor at a very large, public college no matter where they were. So, the attributes that were important were: • Title of contact • Tax status of the school (public or private) • Location of the school • Size of the student body • Their use of the Internet for recruiting With these five simple attributes I could assign a score to each lead and rank order it. When I was at this company we staffed our booth with Trade Show Samurai and brought back literally thousands of lead cards per year—far too many to handle with our small sales force. It was no problem, we simply rank-ordered them and gave our top potential leads to the team. The others we included as part of our lead-nurturing program and we called them when they showed interest. The difference between a business card and a highly qualified lead is the qualifiable information you collect. With it you have a sales feast for the sales team, without it you have fish food.

Immersing the audience in the world of cinema and music, the performers use the entire space -- Los Angeles' DBA Club -- to bring Tarantino's most famous works including Kill Bill, Pulp Fiction and Django Unchained to life.
Rumer remarkably plays multiple characters from Tarantino's films in the two-hour show, most notably Uma Thurman's roles in Pulp Fiction and Kill Bill.
Pics: 'Pretty Little Liars' Welcomes Rumer Willis
"Our knees don't look that pretty after we're done with the show," Rumer tells ET's Rob Marciano about the physically demanding performance, which includes handling guns, knives and even swords. "I mean, it's fun. That's the best part of it. Because not many people get to go and take some of their favorite movies and then sing the songs, or do the scenes. I mean, I love watching Pulp Fiction and watching Uma Thurman doing the twist, so to be able to recreate that ... is so much fun. And people love watching it. It's cool."
Rumer's famous parents Demi Moore and Bruce Willis -- who memorably played Butch Coolidge in 1994's Pulp Fiction -- are definitely supportive of Rumer's exciting new role, with Demi even giving her eldest daughter some pointers.
"It's not a critique, but more so, she just gives me advice and she's got a great eye for this stuff anyway," she explains.
But is Bruce an overprotective father, especially when it comes to some of Rumer's racier scenes?
"He probably won't notice anymore -- he'll just think I'm a bad ass for fighting with a sword," she laughs.
And as for scaring off her boyfriends in real-life?
"No, he's such a goofball. He's a really cool guy," she surprisingly says.

On the upper middle left of the flag there should be a white hand figure like a Hamsa, which is obliterated from this picture for some unknown reason. The flag is in light emerald green color with white characters.

The red sandjak of the Ottoman sultan Selim I represents again Zulfikar. This flag carried to Egypt by Selim I [1466-1520] can be seen in the Topkapi Museum. During the 16th and the 17th centuries the Zulfikar flags were widespread in Ottoman army and numerous red Zulfikar flags left in the battles in Europe are shown in museums and one can even see a red, triangular Zulfikar flag in the Doge Palace in Venice.
Baris Kilicbay,
It might be noted here that the Zulfikar on flags were commonly misinterpreted by mediaeval European painters (and flag authorities) as (tailor's) scissors!
Zeljko Heimer, 20 August 1999
Such a flag can be found on several old flag charts. It is reported on Dutch flag charts as Moorse vlag (Moorish flag); later it became 'Moroccan flag'. An example of the mistake is on Bellin's chart, 1756 - reproduced on the cover of Sierksma's book [sie63].

North Fork St. Lucie Aquatic Preserve provides valuable habitat and protection for a variety of rare and
protected species. Currently 33 listed species (11 plants, 2 fish, 5 reptiles, 13 birds, and 2 mammals) and
three commercially exploited plant species have been documented in and adjacent to the preserve.
The West Indian manatee is the only listed mammal (endangered at both the federal and state level) found
within the preserve. They have been observed using historic riverbends, which are shallower and less traveled
than the main channel, as breeding grounds. The Sherman's fox squirrel, listed through the state as a SSC, can
be found adjacent to the preserve within Savannas Preserve State Park.
Several listed bird species utilize the preserve. The wood stork, both federally and state-listed as
endangered, and several Species of Special Concern (SSC), including little blue heron, osprey, snowy egret and
tricolor heron, use the preserve as breeding grounds from February through July each year. Most of these
species are regularly seen foraging within the preserve, even outside the breeding season. The brown pelican,
a SSC, uses the mangroves for roosting but have not been observed to build nests along the North Fork. The
loss or degradation of wetlands in central and south Florida is the primary threat to wood storks and other
wading birds.
The American alligator and Florida brown snake are the only listed reptiles that inhabit the preserve.
Alligators are a federally-listed threatened species and a state-listed SSC because of their similarity in
appearance to the endangered American crocodile. Alligators are most common in the major river drainage
basins, such as the tributaries to the IRL and large lakes in central and south Florida. They are tolerant of
poor water quality and are commonly seen in local drainage canals, retention ponds and ditches. The Florida
brown snake is threatened at the state level and resides in the marshes and uplands adjacent to the preserve,
but feeds on fish in the North Fork.
The mangrove rivulus and opossum pipefish are the only two federally-listed fish species in the preserve.
These species have a very limited distribution within the continental United States and have unique
habitat requirements that should be protected to the greatest extent possible. The mangrove rivulus is a
tropical killifish that is widely distributed from Florida to Brazil but locally rare as it reaches the
northern extent of its range on both coasts in central Florida. This species was listed by NOAA National
Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS) as a SSC in 1997.

The final product sold to consumers is quite literally, water – drops of which are dried on sucrose or lactose tablets. The fact that:
Hyland’s Homeopathic Canada (Hyland’s), a division of Standard Homeopathic Company, in consultation with Health Canada, is voluntarily recalling its Hyland’s Teething Tablets from the Canadian market because they may pose a risk to children, according to U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) testing. This recall has been initiated in both Canada and the U.S. as a precautionary measure due to the FDA’s ongoing inspection of Standard Homeopathic Company’s manufacturing facility in the U.S. Hyland’s Teething Tablets are manufactured in the U.S. and distributed throughout North America, including Canada.
Hyland’s Teething Tablets are manufactured to contain a small amount of belladonna, a substance that can cause serious harm at larger doses. For such a product, it is important that the amount of belladonna be carefully controlled.
The FDA has received reports of serious adverse events in children taking this product that are consistent with belladonna toxicity but conclusive links have not been formally determined.
Let’s look at the ingredients. The product is listed in Health Canada’s Natural Health Products Database as “Hyland’s Kinder T” (search NPN/DIM-HM 01956485 here)
The ingredients, as approved by Health Canada, and as listed on the manufacturer’s website, are:
Calcarea Phosphorica 3X HPUS – supports dentition.
Here’s a translation from the homeopathic bafflegab:
Calcarea Phosphorica Calcium phosphate, diluted 1 part in 1 thousand.
Chamomilla German chamomile, diluted 1 part in 1 thousand
Coffea Cruda Coffee, diluted 1 part in 1 thousand
Belladonna Deadly nightshade, diluted 1 part in 1 thousand
In a base of Lactose (milk sugar) NF. The diluted liquid is dripped on sugar tablets and dried.
So under normal circumstances, when prepared according to the label, each tablet may give trace amounts of calcium, chamomile plant, coffee, and a highly toxic alkaloid. None of the ingredients have any demonstrated efficacy for teething. But if you give a non-homeopathic dose of belladonna, here’s what the side effects could include:
Fever, rapid pulse, dilation of pupils, hot and dry flushed skin, headache, dry mouth, difficulty of swallowing, burning of the throat, hallucinations, convulsions. Highly toxic, may be fatal if eaten.
The recall raises more questions than answers, from my perspective:
- What evidence exists to demonstrate that Hyland’s Teething Tablets have effectiveness superior to a placebo? There does not appear to be any public information that demonstrates it is effective. Health Canada has approved it as a “homeopathic remedy”. So why is it advertised for teething, and what is the basis for this approval?
- Given belladonna has been associated with severe adverse effects, and has not been shown to have any beneficial effects for teething, why is it being permitted, at any concentration, in a product given to infants?
- There is no infant dose approved by Health Canada: only an adult dose is listed. Why is the marketing for use in infants permitted by Health Canada?
- Health Canada warns users, “Contact a health care practitioner before use if pregnant or breastfeeding, or if symptoms persist for more than 7 days or worsen.” If health care consultation is required if someone is pregnant or breastfeeding (and apparently teething, too), why is it felt to be acceptable to give this product directly to infants?
Conclusion
There’s no clinical rationale for the combination of ingredients in Hyland’s Teething Tablets, nor is there any scientific information to support its use in infants. The product is essentially a sugar pill, possibly with a few molecules of ingredients, some of which have been demonstrated to be toxic at higher concentrations. There is no benefit that one can expect from Hyland’s Teething Tablets, recall or not, and it has no place in the science-based pharmacy.
Update: 14 Nov 2010: Dilutions corrected
10 thoughts on “Hyland’s Teething Tablets: These sugar pills may be toxic”
I may be mistaken, but I thought 3x is one part per thousand, not per million. Wouldn’t 3c be one part per million?
Yes – thank you. It’s even more concerning that a 1:1000 dilution of a toxic alkaloid would be permitted for use in infants.
The 1% dilution of mercuric chloride is also a little unnerving (NPN 80006703). Of course, without a starting concentration the “1CH” potency is not the most useful information.
Health Canada’s action with regard to reported products that are not complying to the regulations is to manage the risk to Canadians.
()
Unfortunately, if the risk is perceived as being low (which is the case with pretty much any homeopathic product), this may translate to inaction.
This would be one of the problems with specialized programs; I have trouble finding fault with an inspectorate that feels that their budget is best spent addressing issues with the greatest amount of risk. That’s logical, and not spending valuable employee time forcing companies to adjust their claims relating to sugar pills and water would seem at first blush to be a sensible stance. After all, the harm caused by sugar pills is likely to be very low. This overlooks the effect that SCAM has on other forms of treatment, the cost associated with people failing to get proven treatments in favour of placebo.
How about putting a baseline dilution level, say 12C for example, that is required for receiving a DIN-HM number?
There is need to have a 3X or 2C dilution because 1) there may contain toxic substances in there, 2) stronger dilutions will only create stronger effects anyways, to follow homeopath’s twisted logic, 3) would prevent products like this from being marketed to the general public.
Typo: ” There is NO need to have a 3x …”

Hey who wrote this? You people obviously have no clue about quantum physics, or science in general. People who write this garbage have clearly not tried homeopathy. Too many people out there are busy interfering with other people’s lives, assaulting their ethics and principles, when really they haven’t event tested those principles. I have been using homeopathy for years, it has worked for me and many of my friends and family. It is used by over a billion people in India. It’s cheap and effective, and does not line the pockets of pharmaceutical fat cats

Steps to ripping out acrylic shower stall enclosure and covering with tiles?

Steps to ripping out acrylic shower stall enclosure and covering with tiles?
I really am just guessing here so please help, lol...
1. Remove drain plate and unscrew shower spicket
2. Cut all caulk with a blade
3. Somehow (really need help here) remove the enclousure
4. Install cememt board with special screws
5. Latex caulk between cement board seams
6. Appy thinset and v-notch it
7. Install tiles with spacers
8. Grout (not sure what type to use)
9. Possibly spray on sealer to just the grout or the entire surface?
Just thought of a few more things...Going to need a "hump" on the floor to keep water in, Frame it with 2x4s and cover it with cement board?
Blah, another thing I just thought have, I already have a tiled floor, I assume I have to keep the same tile design as the floor?

Do you want to change over from an acrylic base to a mortar based shower ? From the post questions and scenario you plan out, this is not something you should do. Have someone who has experience do the base. You can prep and tile the walls with some changes in methodology.
You need a vapor barrier behind the cement board. The seams are sealed with thinset and fiberglass tape designed for cementboard. No latex caulk in the shower area at all. If you pick wall tiles for the wall, they have lugs that build in the spacing. If you want to alter the designed gaps, then use the spacers. If the grout lines are 1/8" or less, use unsanded grout. Over 1/8", use sanded grout. Seal just the grout. If sealer gets on the glazed tile it needs to be washed off.
The surround will be glued to the walls. Use a flat bar or crow bar to remove it. If it's resistant, cut the sheetrock and remove it in pieces.

.I just wanted you to know that I passed on your advice to "fuck first" to one of my best friends. She got married this past weekend. In a conversation a few weeks before the wedding she expressed some concern about "wedding night" sex. Not that she was a virgin, but she seemed stressed about it. I suggested that she find some time after the rehearsal dinner to make it happen. On the day of the wedding, she confessed that she had taken the advice, and she seemed quite happy about it—and was much more relaxed the whole day of the wedding. Turns out your advice applies to all kinds of situations!
Matron Of Honor
My response after the jump...
Thanks for sharing, MOH, and while my "fuck first" advice does indeed apply to all sorts of situations (birthdays, weddings, visits to the DMV, and obviously funerals), it was intended for Valentine's Day—which is tomorrow. Remember, folks, fuck before that big romantic V-Day meal because you're going to be too bloated, too drunk, or too gassy to fuck after. Fuck first, then go to out to dinner. If you feel like fucking again when you get home, Yahtzee. If not, no big deal. Curl up in bed and watch House of Cards instead.
Happy Valentine's Day, everybody!

Tim Keifer has a beef ranch north of Forsyth and says that since the first of April, he's had just two inches of rain, and that means pastures that yielded 1,200 round hay bales last year couldn't muster even one this year. With little forage, he weaned his calves and shipped them to sale yards five weeks earlier than normal.
Keifer isn't alone. The number of cattle moving through Billings and Miles City auction yards was up more than 1,000 head a sale compared to the same dates a year earlier.
That means they're selling with less weight and that's less money for ranchers.

I read this great piece a while back.
It's stunning how people like Gary sick and Daniel pipes are allowed to run amok like rabid dogs to decide the fate of our country.
Gary sick did meddle in the manufactured Devolution of 1979. He just has a knack to be wrong about Iran all the time.
parham
"Gary sick ... just has a knack to be wrong about Iran all the time."
That is so true. I met him in 1985, I asked him why he thought the US media had not said anything about the recent scattered demonstrations that had taken place in Tehran in favor of Bakhtiar (there had been a demo in support of Bakhtiar in Tehran that year whereby a good number of people had turned on their car lights during the day to show their backing). His answer was that he didn't think the Reagan administration would have stopped any such news from being published had they been able to anyway, and that in any case, he didn't think the Regan admin. had any sympathy for the IR, neither were they trying to establish any inroad into the Iranian establishment.
Just a few months later, the whole Iran-Contra affair broke out and it became clear that Robert McFarlane (Reagan's National Security adviser who actually replaced Gary Sick himself at that position after Reagan was elected) had traveled to Iran with presents for the ayatollahs in order to establish a "connection"!
Sick actually even wrote a book about the whole thing afterwards and became a proponent of establishment of ties between the US and the Islamic Republic thereafter! So indeed, he has practically always been wrong about his very subject matter...
P_J. – An Iranian!
These people, the so called” experts”, are intentionally myopic in order to expand their influence/hegemony throughout the world. Using this gimmickry enables them to rationalize and justify their intended robbery, spearheaded by the so called “experts”.
We saw that in 1953 coup against Mossadegh, and I am sure that some IDIOT(s) like the mentioned duo had advised them, the US government, against having the democratic Iran, and had proposed the establishment of a vicious bloody dictator and the SAVAK as its secret police, or henchman, turning Iran into a police state for the next 24 years, and ransacking our wealth.
That outrages behavior resulted in culminating the roots of hatred and revolution and its reverberation brought us another dark and vicious, this time, group of religious monsters!

Dear Parham: I think the overarching goal of the democratic faction of the CIA/Pentagon/Realists/Hawks, has been to liberalize the secular monarchies in Islamic countries, regardless of Presidents. The policy hopes that the Islamists will learn how to navigate the democratic process without resorting to terrorism. So far, their experiment in Iran has failed and has not produced the results intended either for the US or Iran. However, in the long run, it may prove to be actually the right course for changing these islamist societies from bottom up where the masses realize that Islam or Islamists in power are incapable of governing their country or improving their lives or the lives of their children; as it is happening in Iran right now....just my 2 cents.
amirparvizforsecularmonarchy – I Love Waterfalls and Find One of the most humorous things in the world; is the notion that Americans are a greater force for good & more civilized than Nazi's, Mullahs and Communists.
You are wrong on the USA's aims and the reasons for it. This is how they portray their own actions to deceive the public, the USA's game is to hide their own real agenda so no one can read their hand and they can continue down their path. After seeing your optimistic comment I know for sure you don't see the picture at all from a scientific stand point. If the USA cared for the ground up approach they would be helping that and they are not.
parham
Sure, why not. I don't rally know if that is the case --pertaining to hawks, I think they're more inclined to the "bombing into democracy" doctrine-- but I could be wrong.
faraway
I meant the hawks in the democratic party and the realists (Gates is one of them) in the Republican party.

-- MICHAEL FORNABAIOWe think it's time for someone to read Texas governor Rick Perry his last rites. Why? Well, if you missed last night GOP debates, Mr. Death Penalty suffered another epic gaffe on live television. Thereby removing one of the legs beneath his already-wobbly presidential campaign, Perry lost control of his own destiny, and his awkward exchange with Ron Paul will forever live on in the memory of the Internets.
The Michigan audience watched as Perry couldn't remember the last agency he would cut from the federal government—instead choosing to name only two. "Commerce, Education, and the - what's the third one there? Let's see," Perry said before his rivals begun to volunteer answers like the Environmental Protection Agency, which regulates pollution and is very unpopular with conservatives. Going blank on an answer after stammering for 43 seconds is not very presidential, Mr. Perry. Capping it with an "oops" only lets the American public see how mentally deficient Perry can be.
Mitt Romney may have finally knocked out the last of his competition, as Herman Cain continues to fight against allegations of sexual harassment, and Perry proves he has a short-term memory problem. Is it too early to count Bush's favorite Texan out for the GOP nomination? He does have a lot of money in the bank, which can keep him going and allow him the opportunity to right his ship. But is Perry riding on the Titanic or a conservative yacht? You be the judge.
Speak your piece in the comments section below.ALICE IN WONDERLAND was a box office failure despite the all-star cast on it’s release and most attributed it to the excellent makeup that made most of that cast virtually unrecognizable. It also cast doubt that a fantasy peopled with weird characters would ever be a success. That notion lasted all of six years until THE WIZARD OF OZ was released in 1939. The script was taken from both Alice in Wonderland and Through The Looking Glass with a heavy dose from the recent stage presentation.
An all live action film but for a short animated sequence during one of Tweedledee’s stories, it was a rather odd film I thought. It ran last week on Turner Classic Movies. The original running time was ninety minutes which was cut to seventy-seven when television bought the rights in the late fifties. One wonders if that cut footage was lost as it wasn’t included on the DVD release and the Turner showing was that cut length. One noticeable bad cut involved Alice and the Griffin leaving the Mock Turtle sobbing, then Alice
fleeing along with the Red Queen the next instant.
As for the all-star cast, most of them I wasn’t familiar with at all. Not a film buff and most stars probably faded in the intervening years. Notable exceptions were W. C. Fields as Humpty Dumpty(and the face of Humpty looked to me a duplicate of Jabba The Hut from Star Wars), Gary Cooper as The White Knight, Charlie Ruggles as The March Hare, Cary Grant as The Mock Turtle, Richard Arlen as The Cheshire Cat, Edward Everett Horton as The Mad Hatter, and Sterling Holloway as The Frog. None of them were recognizable in that fantastic makeup and only W. C. Fields’ voice was caught by me.
And of course Charlotte Henry as Alice.
The film opens as a bored Alice is stuck in the house during a snow storm. Looking out one window, she sees a white rabbit hopping across the yard and begins to make up fanciful tales. She soon climbs up on a chair to the mantle over the fireplace where she stands in front of a mirror and wonders about the reverse room she sees, finally stepping through and beginning her grand adventure.

Florida Democrats touted their `Countdown to Accountability’ campaign on Thursday, a grass-roots crusade that accuses state Republicans of corrupt leadership in Tallahassee.
The strategy is an attempt to shift the focus of the anti-incumbent mood from Washington to Tallahassee, where Republicans have been in charge for many years. It also is an attempt to put the onus on Republicans for the state’s sluggish economy.
Democratic volunteers will be knocking on doors and holding rallies to deliver this message and try to get their candidates elected up and down the ballot.
“Democrats are ready to take back our state,” Congresswoman Debbie Wasserman Schultz, a Democrat from Weston, told reporters. “For far too long, Republicans have run amok in our state.”
She cited charges that Republican leaders improperly used party funds for personal expenses, and she tried to tie Republican gubernatorial candidate Rick Scott to charges of Medicare fraud.
Wasserman Schultz derided “the same tired old Tallahassee leaders who have put our economy in the ditch.”
In response, Dan Conston of the Florida Republican Party said: “You know you’re desperate when you bring in Nancy Pelosi’s Washington right-hand to try to build enthusiasm for flailing campaigns. There is a reason why Democrats are hindered by such an enthusiasm gap this November: their candidates support and helped create Washington’s agenda of double-digit national unemployment, runaway spending and trillions in debt.”
Most political analysts say the anti-incumbent spirit this year is directed primarily against the president’s party and that voters are focused on the economy and jobs. Democrats are testing that theory by stressing the corruption theme and the fact that Republicans have run state government.
The accountability campaign is also a form of grass-roots politicking to shore up the Democratic ground game to turn out voters.
“We put the fertilizer in grass roots, and we are going to show them on Election Day,” the congresswoman said.News Archives

"I just tagged you in Christmas tag! You need to write five wishes to Santapaws in your diary, then give five bones to the doggy who tagged you, then tag five other doggies. Merry Christmas!"
1. I wish that Mommy and Daddy would win the lottery so they wouldn't have to leave me every day to go to work.
2. I wish that I could figure out how to go pee pee in the center of the wee wee pad so that it doesn't trickle off the side and upset everyone.
3. I wish for more helpings of wet food. Every dog worth his salt loves wet food!
4. I wish for more trips to the park where I can fun free and sniff lots of stuff.
5. But most of all, I wish for more TREATS for everyone!!!!!! Did someone say TREAT? Where are the TREATS????. Mom and Dad like to make up silly songs about my chubby rolls all the time. It's really degrading.
2. I like to lick the couch from time to time.
3. I see dead people! I often like to growl at a random corner of the room.
4. I can't walk in a straight line. I like to constantly walk in circles and tie Mom or Dad up with my leash.
5. I hate when Mom dresses me funny! I prefer to be a nudist.
6. I don't like to get locked in the kitchen. I try to run away and hide when I see Mom and Dad getting ready to go out.
7. I love Mommy most!

My Mommy took me on a special trip to my Aunt Daria's house on Saturday. I've only been there once before, but I LOVED it because it's the place where I learned how to swim. Of course, nobody was ready for me to swim that day! The inground pool wasn't up and running just yet. The water was still black and murky. That didn't stop me! I jumped right in to everyone's horror! Luckily, my little head popped up and I started doing the doggie paddle. The rest of the day was spent trying to keep me from jumping in again.
Since that day, Mommy has been dying to take me back to Aunt Daria's for a proper swim. We finally got a day all set and Mommy packed up the car, threw me in the back seat, and started on our hour trip to Aunt Daria's house for fun and refreshment. We weren't too far into our trip when Mommy started to notice the signs. I was dying! The air conditioner in Mommy's car was not working properly and I just couldn't take the heat. I had my head lying on the armrest in between the two front seats and my tongue was hanging out. Mommy was so scared and not sure what to do. She was on a highway and didn't have too many options. She decided to pull into a gas station and ran into the store to buy me some water. She bought a big bottle and doused me with it. She then filled up what the cup holder in the back seat with water. That was a good idea. I took a long drink. I was starting to look better, but I still wasn't completely back to normal and the car just wasn't cooling down. Mommy drove a little further, but continued to look back at me the whole way to see how I was doing. I was lethargic, but hanging in there. She then pulled the car into the shoulder, reached back to get me, and held me in front of the vents for a while. The air wasn't really cold, but it felt good all the same. That was another good idea. Once Mommy thought I was cool enough, she put me back in the back seat and continued on her way. She was a little more than halfway there at that point, so she decided to put the petal to the metal! We finally got to Aunt Daria's house and Mommy breathed a sigh of relief. She was so scared!
Mommy started to relax once we got inside the cool house. She set out a bowl of water for me and changed into her bathing suit. She couldn't wait to get me in the pool!
A few minutes later, Mommy and I walked over to the pool. I was a little unsure about that place. I love bath-time, but this was a bit different. I inspected the perimeter for a while and then I decided to hop in. I went under at first and then my little head popped up while I doggie paddled. Thank goodness, my Aunt Heather was there to help me! Mommy came rushing over and then scooped me up. She then went back into the deep water with me. She would let me go for a few seconds at at time to watch me swim, but she saw that I wasn't having too much fun so she didn't leave me for long. Aunt Daria brought a raft over. They decided to put me on the raft and push me around. I wasn't sure what to make of the raft. It wasn't very stable, but it was better than sinking in the deep water, so I endured it. Mommy and Aunt Daria snapped a bunch of pictures of me on the raft. They thought it was cute or something. I didn't think it was very funny! Eventually, Mommy let me out of the pool. Here and there, she would try to coax me back in, but I wanted nothing to do with it, THANK YOU!
Later that night, they decided to take me for a walk through a little beach town. Didn't they know that I was completely exhausted? It was a big day for me! We walked around for about 30 minutes when they noticed that I was panting hard again. That Mommy really needs to be more considerate of me! Luckily, she redeemed herself by scooping me up and getting me into Aunt Daria's car. The AC in Aunt Daria's car actually works, so I perked up pretty quickly.
I have spent the last two days trying to recover from all of these brushes with death. I am completely exhausted. I have been walking around in a daze and haven't been especially interested in food or playing. I still like TREATS, I'm not crazy or anything! I just don't scarf down my food like I normally do. I few runs at fetch has been more than enough. I really need to get my rest! It was a long weekend!

$12.95There's that image of the happy gardener taking to the beds come spring with a wide straw hat, some floral-print gloves and a big old silly grin, eager to spend countless hours in the peace of nature.
But friends, that's the Hallmark Hall of Fame version -- the real deal is a lot more HBO prime time. Sometimes, especially during this promiscuous season, Cinemax. Spring reminds us, at least those of us who don't cover our eyes with flowery hands, that it's all about sex and death.
Look to the parasitic wasp, the ichneumon wasp and all the rest, who are such boons to the gardener for preying on caterpillars and other pests. And they're effective: The wasp attacks the caterpillar, sometimes paralyzing it, before injecting its eggs into the body of the host. Those eggs then hatch and proceed to systematically devour the caterpillar from the inside out, eating the digestive tissues while saving the heart and other organs for last, so that the critter will live as long as possible.
Their methods are so inhuman, literally and figuratively, that they stirred up debate amongst 19th-century theologians, who tried to reconcile the existence of such awful traits with the existence of a benevolent God. Which is really hard to believe in if you're a caterpillar.
The late scientist Stephen Jay Gould wrote about all this in a 1982 essay, "Nonmoral Nature," arguing that nature does not subscribe to ethical concerns. Theologians and scientists of the day, trying to find a purpose for such behavior, weighed in on the issue, including none other than Charles Darwin himself.
Here's what Darwin had to say: "I cannot persuade myself that a beneficent and omnipotent God would have designedly created the Ichneumonidae with the express intention of their feeding within the living bodies of Caterpillars." So in the garden, you can attract handy critters at the expense of a deity who may not care about you. Unsettling, true, but anything for unnibbled bulbs, right?
Maybe theology has no business in your bushes, in which case has some advice for luring parasitic wasps to the garden: ."
Because we want the wasps to be safe, after all.
Don't think that the animal kingdom is the only one responsible for what the garden pacifists might call cruel. Consider the black walnut tree, which wages chemical warfare on other plants to prevent competition in the immediate vicinity. The tree emits juglone, a compound that inhibits growth in other plants and leads to wilting and death. If it could poison people, no doubt it would. But if you have well-drained soil, the Pseudomonas bact eria can flourish. The bacteria feed on the juglone, and your tree is suddenly manageable.
But none in the garden is more savage than the grinning madman with the flowery gloves: pruning, uprooting, poisoning, mulching, trapping, creating a world that might cause even the most malevolent God to switch from HBO to Lifetime. Now, especially, gardeners are laying down the weedkiller, carefully engineering the aesthetic population.
Suppose you do want nature to have a presence and decide to go with a wildflower garden. Virginia Cooperative Extension gives all the grisly details: "Early spring when the first weeds begin to emerge, is the time to make your first application of a broad spectrum herbicide (e.g., Glyphosate). Ten to 14 days after your application, shallowly cultivate the area, allow weed seed to germinate, and apply herbicide again. Ridding the bed of annual and perennial weeds and their dormant seeds will enhance establishment and greatly lessen the problem of weeding during the summer."
It's all sex and death, sex and death, which is what's selling on the networks these days anyway. But let's leave the last word to Darwin, who traveled far and wide in pursuit of greater scientific meaning and found, sure as Cinemax, sex and death: "What a book a devil's chaplain might write on the clumsy, wasteful, blundering, low, and horribly cruel works of nature!"US construction figures on the rise
Construction spending rose in the US in September, official figures have shown
The Department of Commerce estimated that investment during the month hit an annualised and seasonally adjusted rate of $851.6 billion.
This was up 0.6 per cent on the revised August figure, and 7.8 per cent higher than the rate for September 2011.
Construction investment in the year to date is now 8.9 per cent higher than in the same periods last year, fuelling talk of a recovery.
While public sector construction continued to slow in September 2012, this was outweighed by a rise in private building.
Private residential construction rose by 2.8 per cent from August to $285.9 billion; private non-residential work was virtually flat to $294.6billion.
Last month there was also an additional 17,000 jobs created in the construction sector - the most since January 2012.
The overall recovery mood is tempered by the current election uncertainty
Falls in public office and commercial spending were the most stark, while there was also a smaller drop in the substantial education sector.
Experts have been divided over the state of the US architecture market, with different sectors and locations seemingly reacting in very different ways.
Buro Happold North America managing director David Herd told AJ in October that it would be spring 2013 before a way forward became clear.
‘The overall recovery mood is tempered by the current election uncertainty, debt ceiling uncertainty and tax uncertainty,’ he.It has been clear for a very long time-- at least since I was a student in the 1970s-- that simple possible-worlds treatments do badly at accounting for EPISTEMIC modality of the sort in question. (This despite the fact that, not long after the beginning of modern possible-worlds semantics in the 1960s, Hintikka described a possible-worlds semantics for epistemic and doxastic notions in his influential book "Knowledge and Belief." I think he was explicit in saying that the theory was an idealization, not applicable to mathematical ignorance without refinement.) (((Vocabulary: "Epistemic" logic is often construed broadly, as covering knowledge and a variety of related notions. When knowledge is being distinguished from (mere) belief, "doxastic" refers to the belief operators.))) It is, I think, much harder to model MATHEMATICAL ignorance in a possible-worlds framework than it is to give an account of the sense in which, e.g., water MIGHT (have turned out) not (to) be H20. Kripke ("Naming and Necessity") pointed out that the latter is an epistemic "might" (and not the "metaphysical" possibility he was primarily concerned with), but it seems possible to define THIS kind of epistemic possibility: roughly It is metaphysically possible for their to be someone whose evidence for a statement of the same logical form as "water is H20" is similar to our evidence (before modern chemistry) for "water is H20" even though their statement is false. This won't work for mathematical statements if the "evidence" is allowed to include knowledge of the truth of axioms from which the statement follows logically. Many approaches to this problem have been suggested; none to my knowledge have been worked out in adequate detail: (1) Early workers in RELEVANT (or relevance) logics often gave, as a motivating hope, the possibility (so to speak) of developing an epistemic logic based on them which would tolerate ignorance of mathematical and logical truths. (Since the Routley-Meyer semantics for relevant logics makes use of "worlds" -- they preferred to call them "set-ups" in their early papers -- in which logical truths fail, this suggestion could be seen as connecting to the idea of partial worlds, though their set-ups could be inconsistent as well as incomplete.) (2) Other suggestions about the use of partial or inconsistent structures instead of full, classical, models as possible worlds have been made. One of Hintikka's compatriots (sorry, I've forgotten the exact reference and will try to give it in a supplementary post if no one else beats me to it) published a paper in an early (1970s) volume of the "Journal of Philosophical Logic" proposing that "surface" models be used. This is a notion derived from Hintikka's work on Distributive Normal Forms: it would allow "possible worlds" in which sentences inconsistent by First Order Logic are true, provided that the proof of their inconsistency exceeds some measure of quantificational complexity. (Sorry to give such a vague account of it, but this letter is long enough as it is! If you are not familiar with Hintikka's work and are wondering whether you would be interested enough for it to be worth following up, think "Herbrand expansions, complexity of.") (3). I think the problem is an open one, and perhaps-- given the use of epistemic logics in AI-- an important one. Note that approaches (2) and (3) above, and probably even (1) (though Meyer and Routley themselves were not Platonists) are consistent with quite extreme forms of Platonism. I would expect a satisfactory solution to be so consistent. --- Allen Hazen Philosophy Department University of MelbourneSearch:

Further Progress On CAA Repatriation Flights Following XL Collapse - 3.15pm, 14 September 2008
Date: 14 September 2008 announced that at midday today, 14 September, it has arranged a total of 94 repatriation flights, which have carried or will carry 22,090 customers of the failed holiday company XL.
The XL customers who have been repatriated to date are those who had completed their holidays and were due to return to the UK on Friday (the day of the XL failure) and this weekend. The CAA’s priority has been to organise the return of these passengers and this repatriation exercise should be substantially completed by the end of Monday.
The CAA is also working to replicate as closely as possible over the next couple of weeks the XL flight programme, to enable the approximately 30,000 people who are still on holiday to continue their holidays in the knowledge that their flight home will take place as close as possible to the original planned time. So that XL customers can complete their holidays, the exercise will continue for the next two weeks.
The flights are organised by the CAA for the customers protected under its ATOL protection scheme, and the CAA is also offering capacity to enable those passengers who had bought only a flight with XL Airways and so are not ATOL-protected to fly back to the UK at a reasonable price. These ‘flight only’ customers who are not ATOL-protected and so paying for their flight back to the UK are not obliged to use the CAA arrangements.
Richard Jackson, CAA Director of Consumer Protection, said: “The CAA, with extensive help from the travel trade, has been working very hard to look after XL’s customers. Our immediate challenge has been to repatriate holidaymakers due home in the days immediately following the company’s collapse. We are also working to ensure the timely return of those who are continuing their holidays over the next couple of weeks.
“No one who is an ATOL-protected customer should feel stranded. Whilst we’ve had some problems, including adverse weather conditions in the Caribbean making it difficult to position replacement aircraft, all customers will be able to return from their holidays, and as close to their planned flight times as possible. This is a massive logistical exercise, and its cost will be covered by the CAA’s ATOL funding arrangements.”
The flights currently organised by the CAA are from Alicante, Malaga (Spain); Athens, Corfu, Heraklion, Kalamata, Kavala, Kefalonia, Kos, Mykonos, Preveza, Rhodes, Skiathos, Zante (Greece); Bodrum, Dalaman (Turkey); Cagliari (Sardinia); Faro (Portugal); Hurghada, Sharm El Sheikh (Egypt); Grenada (Caribbean); Paphos (Cyprus); Las Palmas, Tenerife (Canaries); Mahon (Minorca); Orlando, Sanford (Florida); and Palma (Majorca). The aircraft are being provided by Astraeus, BA, bmi British Midland, First Choice Airways, Jet2.com, Monarch Airlines, Thomsonfly, Virgin Atlantic and a number of overseas airlines.
Thomson, First Choice, Thomas Cook and Virgin Holidays staff are continuing to provide essential support on the ground in resorts, with cooperation from other tour operators and the Federation of Tour Operators (FTO), which is helping to coordinate this operation.
People can consult the CAA website under 'failure of XL Leisure Group' and 'more information for passengers in resort' for up-to-date information on all repatriation flights that have been arranged. The call centre numbers are +44 (0) 2891 856547 for customers abroad; and 0870 590 0927 for customers in the UK with advance bookings. Customers are asked to check the ATOL website before telephoning as the information they need is likely to be found there.
Notes to editors:
ATOL (short for Air Travel Organisers’ Licensing) is managed by the CAA and gives comprehensive protection from losing money or being stranded abroad to.

Last year the theme of the conference was just sheer size. Oracle had ramped up the scale of the conference to cope with all the acquisitions. The number of attendees went from 29,000 to 41,000. This year's projected attendance of 45,000 is a smaller increase (although it will still be mad).
In 2005 the theme was Fusion. There's recently been some upheaval in the Fusion programme, with slippage in both the scope and the delivery schedule, so it'll be interesting to see what the message will be. They'll have to say something. Let's hope senior executives are hot-pluggable too.
In 2003 the hype was all about 10g: The Grid Has Landed. Even though the actual software was still several months from delivery. Obviously there will be a lot of noise around 11g at this conference. The difference is the database has been available, at least in Linux flavours, for several months now. A large chunk of the audience will be in a position to rebut any wild assertions. So whilst there will undoubtedly be a lot of noise about the new software there will have to be less hyperbole. At least I hope so.

Carlos Zambrano’s game has been as consistent as his temper. Alfonso Soriano’s career has taken him from Superstar 2nd Baseman to cancerous Left Fielder. Outside of 2010, Aramis Ramirez has been a stud, when healthy. However, “outside of 2010,” and “when healthy,” are quite the qualifiers. Marlon Byrd has been solid, but before him there was Milton Bradley. And Milton Bradley was replaced by Carlos Silva. That’s right; Milton Bradley and Carlos Silva are the honorable mentions. That’s how bad things have been for the Cubs.
But alas, new ownership will bring a deep-rooted, philosophical change to an organization that has been putting the pedal to the floor and spinning its wheels for far too long. The Cubs are starting over, and in time, they’ll be back on top. In their wake, they will leave a vacancy for the title of King Albatross. But which team will take their place? Who will be the heir to their overpriced throne? This off-season may have provided some clues.
The Washington Nationals
Early in the offseason, the Nationals had been rumored to be have made Prince Fielder an offer. Since then, the Nationals have vehemently denied interest in Fielder. However, some reports continue to link Fielder to Washington. If the Nationals sign Fielder, they will have one of the best teams in the NL. They will also have one of the most expensive future payrolls in all of MLB.
Fielder would mark the second top client of Scott Boras that the Nationals have signed in as many years, as they signed Jayson Werth to an enormous contract last season. After years of cellar-dwelling, and top-5 draft picks, the Nationals have a tremendous amount of young talent. Ryan Zimmerman is arguably the league’s best 3rd Baseman. Stephan Strasburg is arguably the league’s scariest Starting Pitcher. Drew Storen is the closer of the future. Bryce Harper has the potential to be an all-time great power hitter, while Wilson Ramos, Danny Espinosa, and Michael Morse fill out a solid lineup. Jordan Zimmerman has shown promise, and the Nationals have just bolstered their starting staff by trading for Gio Gonzalez.
The Nationals would love to sign Ryan Zimmerman to a contract extension, and if they want to remain competitive, they absolutely must keep Strasburg around by paying him sooner than later. But with Ryan Zimmerman, Stephen Strasburg, and Jayson Werth making $10-$20 Million for the next 6 years, the Nationals payroll could be on the verge of ballooning.
A Prince Fielder mega-deal will not just hinder Washington’s efforts to extend Zimmerman or Strasburg, but it could prevent them from retaining players like Ramos, Espinosa, Morse, and Harper further down the road. Combine the idea that their mega deals could prevent them from retaining their younger players with the possibility that a player gets hurtor has a decrease in production, and the Nationals could quickly become a future-day version of the Chicago Cubs.
The Los Angeles Angels
In a day, the Angels added the best free agent hitter and the best free agent pitcher on the market. In a day, the Angels became better on paper than the 2-time defending AL champion Texas Rangers. What was the cost, though? Pujols is going to make a lot of money over the next 10 years. But for the next two years, he’ll only make $12 and $16 million. That’s an incredible value for the Angels, as those should be the two most productive years of his contract. The Angels were able to get such good value in those first two years by severely back-loading his deal. In 2014, his salary will jump from $16 to $23 million, and will increase by $1 million each year until he is making $30 million in 2021.
Obviously it’s impossible to project the makeup of the Angels ’21 squad, but we do know one thing: A 42 year old Albert Pujols will be earning $30 million. So, while the Angels are getting Pujols’ best years for cheap, they’ll be paying a premium for his worst years.
As if a $250 million contract wasn’t enough, the Angels also signed left-handed pitcher, CJ Wilson to a 5 year, $77.5 million back-loaded deal that will pay him $10 million in 2012, and incrementally rise to $20 million in 2016. That means that in 2016, Pujols and Wilson will be able to pay the 2010 Marlins.
The good news for the Angels’ future, despite carrying several other large contracts (Vernon Wells, Dan Haren, Ervin Santana, and Jared Weaver), is that they just negotiated a new TV deal with Fox that will be worth $3 billion. $3,000,000,000! That’s like a century’s worth of Marlins teams!
The new TV deal means that the Angels should have no problem paying their players. However, when you backload long-term deals like this, you run the risk of having a team full of aging players that are either injured or underperforming. The Angels are going to look great for the next 2-3 years, but things could change very swiftly after that.
The Miami Marlins
Those Marlins jokes you just read aren’t exactly applicable anymore. I had to get them in while I could because the Marlins are no longer a joke. Or, at least they’re not the same kind of joke. The Marlins were so notoriously cheap that MLB had to intervene last season, forcing them to spend more of the revenue sharing money that they receive each year.
As the Marlins open a new stadium in Miami, they’ve decided to open their pocketbooks. They overpaid Jose Reyes and signed Mark Beurhle to a 4-year contract. They even made a far-too-serious offer to Pujols. Miami has been spending like there’s a Mayan calendar hanging on Jeffrey Loria’s wall.
The Marlins are already paying a lot of money to Josh Johnson and Hanley Ramirez. They will soon need to pay a lot of money to Logan Morrison, Gaby Sanchez, and Anibal Sanchez. The money can’t continue to come out of nowhere, can it?
Obviously, the Marlins are putting a lot of stock into the new stadium’s ability to create revenue. The days of 7,000 fans per night are over. The new stadium is in a much better location, it’s actually a baseball stadium, and there will be a competitive product on the field. It will certainly create revenue, especially in its inaugural season.
The problem becomes whether or not the stadium can create a sustainable amount of revenue. Florida fans have been historically apathetic, so even if there is a huge influx of fans in 2012, it seems foolish to bet as much money as the Marlins bet this offseason on attendance remaining high in a city like Miami. At least when the Angels decided to increase payroll, they had an actual contract stating that revenue was going to increase for the next 20 years. The only guarantee that the Marlins have is that there are plenty of other things to do in Miami.
Despite spending all sorts of money that they’ve never spent before, the Marlins managed to maintain one sliver of sanity. The Marlins still refuse to offer no-trade clauses. Just like the little red button that we all like to imagine the President has, the Marlins have the ability to blow it all up if things get out of hand.
Are the Marlins the most likely team to become the newest version of the Cubs? That remains to be seen, but the odds might not be in their favor. The Angels have worse contracts, but at least we know they can afford them. The Nationals could be on the verge of doubling their payroll, but their owners are incredibly wealthy, and they have plenty of young talent to back it up. The Marlins, on the other hand, just have a whole lot of question marks.'If I had known how wonderful it was I'd have booked sooner.'

Panel: Advertising Needs Bigger Dose of DM
After all, marketers try to reach audiences of one regardless of the media used, he told attendees at a recent roundtable organized by Y&R's Wunderman Irvine unit.
"We're still locked in silos: online versus offline, general versus CRM," he said.
To that, a senior executive from Ford Motor Co.'s Land Rover division challenged agencies to adopt a more consumer-centric, integrated marketing model.
"I think agencies should realign themselves," said Natalie Bow, relationship marketing manager at Land Rover.
Y&R might listen. It has all four parts of the prestigious Land Rover business -- direct, interactive, general and retail advertising. But in keeping with most automakers' corporate structures, disparate communications exist for, say, the finance, retail or after-sales functions.
A major issue, even for an established online brand like Yahoo, is to get marketers and ad agencies to test new tactics or marketing tools.
"It's how to get agencies to get their clients to think out of the box," said Lisa Nash, vice president of consumer and direct marketing at Yahoo.
That said, many of those who had gathered at the Four Seasons in Newport Beach, CA, acknowledged the DM challenges they face in the cluttered media environment.
"The mass-market advertising model has come to find itself without a mass market," said Dan Olson, senior vice president and managing director of Wunderman Irvine and the roundtable host. "Consumers live and communicate in different and specific channels now more than any other place in history. A lasting recession has brought new pressures on advertising to be more accountable, to deliver better results on ever-increasing sales goals. Relationship marketing also has many challenges with issues such as cost and privacy."
For some of those assembled, the problems were basic. For others, they were more complex.
Take Mazda. The company has 700 dealers nationwide. Each runs its own direct marketing programs. The challenge is to get the company and its retailers to view DM as a strategy, not a tactic.
"We have to continue to educate both our management and dealers about the fundamentals of direct marketing and how to track," said David Sanabria, group manager for CRM and Internet at Mazda.
His colleague, Mazda interactive marketing manager Bill Ewing, was equally keen to know when to talk with customers and prospects, the appropriate offers and recognition and what to communicate.
"We want to know what dialogue will trigger future communications ... what can we deliver at the right time to change their behavior?" Ewing said.
A senior executive at Ford's Lincoln Mercury worried that her division still relied on television.
"We need to internally focus on where to spend our marketing mix," said Linda Perry-Lube, e-business and CRM manager at Lincoln Mercury. "But the reality is we need to be talking to our customers more one-to-one."
Wunderman Irvine management supervisor Jason Maloney agreed. He stressed using direct response print and TV for their measurable qualities. The challenge is "maintaining that customer focus where it's so product-centric," he said.
Even if that is achieved, there is always a tussle to balance the control that consumers want with the marketing persuasion to lead them to the desired action.
"Products become services if properly delivered," said Lester Wunderman, founder of his self-named agency and chief guest at the roundtable.
For Erik Nielsen, vice president and management supervisor at Wunderman Irvine, the question of the moment is clear: "Where does the purchase decision lie?" he said.
Telemarketing usually thrusts people into making decisions. But with that tactic increasingly out of favor with consumers, marketers need another medium that offers similar, albeit slower, response to action.
"That decision space has migrated to the Internet," Wunderman's Olson said, "so we need to better manage the information process."
Ditech.com, a lending subsidiary of General Motors Corp. and not a Wunderman Irvine client, finds that the customer relationship is influenced by interaction with company staff. Essentially, Ditech's call center employees affect the next sale, said Sandra Ballard, director of marketing for direct response.
"When there's a lot of calls," Ballard said, "it's more agents on the phone, and they become selective. When it's slower, customer service improves."
Like many manufacturers, toy maker Mattel's issues are complex. Retailers control data on consumer purchases and often do not share information. Then there is optimization of the marketing budget: how to split the ad spend among product lines, media channels, tactics and markets?
Even more troubling, TV does not deliver as it did in the past, as a widening credibility gap is appearing with children and their parents.
"We're seeing a much higher level of skepticism in mass advertising, and this skepticism develops even at ages 5 or 6," said Bob Aniello, a senior director of new media at Mattel.Reported.”

EU politics: the way the world works
Richard North
,
03/01/2013
Follow @eureferendum
Not many people could bring to mind the treaty which the UK has signed on Antarctic krill, but the fact that we have provides a fascinating insight into how this modern world of ours works.
The treaty itself is known as the
Convention on the Conservation of Antarctic Marine Living Resources
(CCAMLR) which, according to
this site
came into force in 1982, as part of the Antarctic Treaty System.
The aim of the Convention, we are told, is to conserve marine life. This does not exclude harvesting as long as such harvesting is carried out in a rational manner, but it has spawned a huge raft of regulations to which signatory countries (Contracting Parties) are required to enact.
The interesting thing here is that, while the UK is a signatory, we have made no regulations to implement the convention, even though we fully comply with it. The reason for this is because the EU is also a signatory. Rather than producing our own national regulations, therefore, we have relied on the EU making them, which we then implement.
A typical example of this process is Council Regulation (EC)
No 1721/1999
of of 29 July 1999, laying down certain control measures in respect of vessels flying the flag of Non-Contracting Parties to the Convention on the Conservation of Antarctic Marine Living Resources.
This regulation came into effect after the 16th Annual Meeting of CCAMLR in 1997, when the signatories adopted a conservation measure on a "Scheme to Promote Compliance by Non-Contracting Party Vessels with CCAMLR Conservation Measures".
The objective was to ensure that the effectiveness of conservation and enforcement measures established by CCAMLR is not undermined by Non- Contracting Party vessels. It required of the signatories to impose an inspection regime on vessels flying the flag of non-contracting parties, which had been sighted engaging in fishing activities in the Convention area.
Such vessels seeking to land or transship produce in an EU member state could only do so in a designated port, whence an inspection would be carried out to ascertain whether the produce had been caught in accordance with the Convention. If the master cannot prove this, then entry has to be denied.
Largely, this and many other similar regulations are entirely unobjectionable. The EU does not originate the regulations – it merely transcribes the wishes of the CCAMLR signatories, and turns them into actionable law. Interestingly, Norway is a signatory, which takes an active part in the proceedings and thus, effectively, has a hand in dictating what eventually becomes EU law.
Now, should the UK leave the European Union, without an agreement which covers the CCAMLR, the EU regulations would no longer apply to the UK, and there would thus be no mechanism for enforcing the Convention in the territories of the UK, or in respect of UK-registered ships.
Since that would mean that the UK was then in breach of the Convention, the British government would then be faced with the prospect of drafting and enacting a mass of regulations top replace the defunct EU legislation or, more likely, it would chose to re-enact the EU law.
However, it is not that simple. The UK would also have to redefine its designated ports – those which are permitted to carry out inspections - which must then conform with EU requirements, if the produce was then to be allowed into the EU, either directly or as ingredients of processed foods.
This may be a minor problem in the grander scheme of things but it is not insignificant. Much of the krill fished is used as fish-farm feed and to produce Omega 3 oil and other health supplements. And according to the loss-making
Guardian
,
harvesting is an expanding industry.
Although the UK does not have a major interest in the krill fishery, unregulated imports could have a significant effects of the Scottish farmed salmon industry, where krill is regarded as an important and growing
feed source
.
If the UK no longer had the EU regulations in place, the EU could quite legitimately ban the imports of all Scottish salmon unless the suppliers could prove that the krill in any krill-based feed had been fished in accordance with the CCAMLR regime. Other countries, such as the United States, might also apply a prohibition, on the basis on non-conformity with EU rules.
Furthermore, loss of this trade would be only one possible effect of a unilateral withdrawal from the EU. Crucially, there are thousands of different conventions, agreements, protocols and other arrangements which might be affected by our withdrawal and make it more difficult to export. Individually, they might not be too important, but collectively the effect could be massive, so they all need to be examined and any effect neutralised.
Thus, before we leap, we need a good hard look. Withdrawal from the EU is by no means impossible. But it is difficult, and pretending we can walk away without a carefully negotiated settlement already in place is irresponsibility bordering on criminal stupidity.

Are you joining me today?I seen Tivo2Go on the Mac…perhaps they’ve been developing a different application for OSx?Â Tivo also started hiring Mac programmers last summer, and, again…no Tivo2Go…so what are they working on?
Here’s the part that really raises my DOUBTS about this rumor…
the name iTV has changed to Mac Media Capsule
Ain’t no way.
“Mac Media Capsule” is just about the worst name I’ve ever heard for a device…period.Â Much less an Apple device.Â It’s only slightly worse than the name Wii…but still terrible.
There is NO WAY that Apple is renaming iTV to Mac Media Capsule.
So…there you have it…another wild Apple rumor.
With Macworld just around the corner, I doubt this will be the last one that we see…
I doubt that they will be partnering, but if Apple decides to go the DVR/PVR route, then I guess they will have to go by TiVo to license all of their patents.
And why would Apple name the iTV a capsule? Its a flat Mac Mini-like shape, not a cylinder. I wouldn’t even claim that this rumor has a 5% chance of being valid.
capsule is a container like a box
Look at the names of the new products Apple has been releasing as of late: mac book, mac mini, mac pro. It is clear that they are attempting to rebrand themselves as the “Mac” provider with regards to their computers. Which leads me to the conclusion that the Mac Media Capsule would only be likely as a name if they were going to make it a full fledged Mac. That seems unlikely to me, possible, but unlikely. I think a far more likely product is a joint venture with TiVO where TiVO becomes enable to read video streams from any Mac in the house.
Re: Branding.
Mac…xyz = computer products (mini, book, book pro, imac)
i…xyz = lifestyle products (iLife, iPod, iPhone, iTv, iTunes, iDVD)
Apple doesn’t need to go through TiVo for any licenses for hard drives to record TV.
If they decided to act indepently, there is a device that allows you to access/watch your TV shows from any computer called Slingbox, which they’ve most likely modeled the concept on. If you could buy shows via iTMS AND record local TV and be able to watch those shows from a remote location… that would be the ultimate device. Regardless of dreaming, this device will allow you to access your computer and use it in a way that’s more like conventional TiVo/DVR. I think, if anything, you’ll be able to choose whether or not you want to download the shows to your local computer, iTV or both.
Ironically, the Mac Media Capusle makes me think it is true, as that is exactly the kind of internal name Tivo would give a project like this.Statistical mechanics and thermodynamics

Introduction[edit]
The properties of a macroscopic physical systems ultimately derives from the properties of its fundamental constituents. Since an exact solution for many particle systems with nontrivial interactions is out of the question, one is forced to resort to statistical methods to make progress. Statistical methods can, of course, only be used when we know the probabilities for finding the system in a particular state. The fundamental postulate of statistical physics is that all accessible states of an isolated system are a priori equally likely. Here "state" means the exact quantum state of the system which thus provides for a full microscopic description of the system. This postulate can be motivated by Liouville's theorem and Boltzmann's H-theorem which we'll discuss later in this course.
A macroscopic property of a system is, in general, obtained from the exact state after a coarse graining. Properties such as the internal energy, temperature, pressure etc. are examples of such macroscopic properties and they all have to be understood as (derived from) coarse grained variables. In principle, however, one can make any arbitrary choice for the macroscopic properties. For any choice, one defines the so-called "macrostate" of the system to be the set of these variables. Thermodynamics is the study of the relations between the macroscopic proprties of the system. In thermodynamics, the word "state" is often used for "macrostate". To avoid confusion, it is customary to call the exact physical state of the system the "microstate".
A system is said to be in thermal equilibrium if its macrostate is time independent. A major part of statistical mechanics is the study of systems in or very close to thermal equilibrium. It follows from the fundamental postulate that lacking any information about a system, the most likely macrostate is that state for which the number of microstates that corresponds to it, is maximal. Any initial macrostate should thus evolve to such a macrostate, which is thus the thermal equilibrium state. This conclusion is known as the Second Law of Thermodynamics.
In the next section we'll apply the methods of statistical mechanics to isolated systems characterised by their total energy.
The Micro-Canonical Ensemble[edit]
Since the total energy of an isolated system is conserved, all accessible microstates have the same energy. The macroscopic variable corresponding to the total energy, E, has to be understood as a coarse grained variable corresponding to the total energy of the system. We define this as follows: When E is specified, the total energy of the system can be in the range between E and
, where
is assumed to be small on a macroscopic scale. We'll see later that the value of macrosopic quantities per unit mass or unit volume in the limit of infinite system size do not depend on the choice of
.
We define the function
to be the number of microstates with energies with an energy in the range between E and
. All these states are equally likely in thermal equilibrium. One can then compute macroscopic properties of systems by averaging over all the
states. Put differently, one can imagine the so-called "microcanonical ensemble " ensemble of of systems with microstates in each of the
states. Averaging over this ensemble yields the macroscopic thermal variables.
Definition of temperature[edit]
Now consider two such isolated systems in internal equilibrium, but isolated from each other. They have internal energies of
and
. The number of microstates the systems can be in are then
and
, respectively. Suppose we bring the two systems into contanct, such that energy can flow between the two systems. The total internal energy
of the combined system will then be conserved. The total number of accessible states the combined system can be in, is clearly given by:
Here the summation variable
increases by a steps of
. This then means that the coarse grained internal energy variable E for the combined system determines its exact system's energy to be in the range between
and
. Obviously, the most likely energy distribution over the two systems is such that the product
is maximal. When we start with any other energy distribution and bring the two systems into thermal contact, energy will flow until that particular equilibrium state is reached. While there is then still a small probability for the energy distribution to deviate from this equilibrium state, it turns out that this is exeedingly unlikely, because the product of the two omega functions has a very sharp maximum.
We can formally compute the condition for thermal equilibrium between the two subsystems by maximizing the function
. It is convenient to take the logarithm of this function and equate the derivative of that w.r.t.
to zero. This gives:
In the derivative of
we can change variables by putting
. By the chain rule, we then have:
Note that the l.h.s. of the equation only refers to the property of system 1 and the r.h.s only to the properties of system 2. For any arbitrary isolated system with internal energy E, we define the so-called temperature parameter
as:
The condition that two isolated systems in internal thermal equilibrium are also in thermal equilibrium with each other (i.e. that when they are brought into thermal equilibrium no energy will flow between them), is thus that the two temperature parameters of both systems are equal. The thermodynamic temperature T is defined by:
where k is a arbitrary constant that fixes the temperature scale. If we choose to measure the thermodynamic temperature in Kelvin, then this constant is fixed to be Boltzmann's constant. We'll see later that this definition of thermodynamic temperature implies that energy flow between two systems as a result of thermal contact is from the high temperature system to the low temperature system.
While the Omega functon is not accessible at the macroscopic level, the entropy, defined as:
is a thermodynamic variable that can (indirectly) be determined from the macroscopic thermal properties of the system. From the above definitions, it follows that the temperature T can be expressed as:
Now, this equation is only valid for isolated systems that don't perform any work. I.e. when the energy is added it goes into the internal thermal energy of thre system. In general, we deal with systems that can perform work. In general this can be described by so-called external parameters, such as the volume of the system. The energy change due to the change in the external parameters is called work. Thermal energy that flows into a system that is not due to work is called heat.
The fundamental thermodynamic relation[edit]
We will now show that in general, when heat is added to a system so slowly that it remains in internal thermal equilibrium (such slow processes are called quasistatic processes), we have:
i.e. the change in entropy depends only on the added heat to the system and not on changes in internal energy due to work.:
The first part of this equation, which can be written as:
(1)
is called the fundamental thermodynamic relation. It is more general than the equation
, as the former is also valid when the changes in the system are not quasistatic. This is because the internal energy in thermal equilibrium will be completely determined by when S and X are specified. So, we can consider E to be a function of S and X (we say that E is a thermodynamic state function) and we always have:
The fact that (1) is valid for quasistatic changes then allows us to concclude that the partial derivatives in the above equation are given by:
The equation (1) is thus always valid, albeit it that for non-quasistatic changes we cannot identify the two terms as heat added and work done by the system anymore. Also we don't always have to intepret the infinitesimal changes as a change that actually happens in a system. E.g. one can consider two copies of the same system but with slightly different thermodynamic variables. Then dE, dS and dx can refer to the difference in internal energy, entropy, and external parameter between the two systems. These changes will satisfy (1).
Canonical Ensemble[edit]
Often, the system we want to study is not isolated, but instead is in thermal contact with an environment at some fixed temperature. Now, for a large system a system kept at some temperature will fix its internal energy with negligible energy fluctuations relative to the total internal energy. So, we could just as well treat such systems using the microcanonical ensemble. However, it turns out that doing computations in the microcanonical ensemble is rather inconvenient.
Since a system kept at constant temperature is in thermal contact with an environment, usually called a heat bath, it is no longer true that all microstates of the system are equally likely. We can find the probability to find the system in some microstate as follows. We imagine that the system is kept at constant temperature by a heat bath such that the system plus heat bath is an isolated system. The accessible microstates for this combined system are then all equally likely. Suppose that the combined system has a total energy of E. If the system is in some microstate with energy
, then we can express the total number of states the combined system can be in, in terms of the omega function of the heat bath as
. Since all states are equally likely, this is proportional to the probability
of finding the system in the microstate with an energy
:
for some constant C. Here one has to define the omega functon by chosing the energy resolution
smaller than the spacing between the energy levels of the system. For the Omega function to be well defined we have to choose
to be much larger than the spacing between the energy leles in the heat bath. These conditions can be satified because the heat bath will have to consist of far more degrees of freedoms than the system in order to be able to be able to absorb heat from the system and yet stay at (almost) constant temperature. The more degrees of freedom a system has, the smaller the spacing between the energy levels will be.
The above expression for
can be simplified as follows. We can write:
for some constant K. Here we have used the definition of the temperature parameter given in the previous section and that in the limit of an ideal heat bath, the higher order terms in the Taylor expansion tend to zero as they involve the change in temperature due to change in the system's energy. It thus follows that:
where the normalization constant Z is the so-called partition function which is given by:
The canonical ensemble is a hypothetical ensemble of copies of a system whose microstates are distributed according to
.
Computation of thermodynamic variables[edit]
The system's thermodynamic variables can be computed by averaging over the probability distribution
. It turns out that a knowledge of the partition function suffices to extract all of the system's thermodynamic variables. In this section, we'll derive the equations for the internal energy, generalized forces, and the entropy in terms of Z.
The internal energy is expectation value of the system's energy. This can be expressed in terms of the partition function in the following way:
If the system is in the state r, then the generalized force corresponding to an external variable x is given by
The expectation value of this is the thermodynamic generalized force of the system and this can be written as:
Suppose the system has one external variable x. Then changing the system's temperature parameter by
and the external variable by dx
where
is the ground state degeneracy. The partition function in this limit is
where
is the ground state energy. We thus see that
, therefore:
The Helmholtz free energy F can thus be expressed as:
Grand Canonical Ensemble[edit]
In this ensemble we attach our system to a heat-particles reservoir in order to fix the temperature and the chemical potential of our system. The chemical potential is defined as
. In previous ensembles we fixed number of particles
in the system. Now we let it change, so now we should rectify the expression of the energy and all its derivatives.
![ \begin{matrix}
&dU=\tau d\sigma-pdV+\mu dN \\
&dF=-\sigma d\tau-pdV+\mu dN \\
&d\sigma=\frac{dU}{\tau}+\frac{p}{\tau}dV -\frac{\mu}{\tau}dN
\end{matrix}]()
We start by defining the probability of a certain state as:
where
Directly from
, the Grand Partition Function, we shall derive the definition of the Grand Thermodynamical Potential,
.
Another form of
is:
. The differential form of
is:
There are other possible ensembles, some of them we shall see in this course.
Gibbs Potential[edit]
We should now elaborate a specific characteristic of physical parameters of a thermodynamic system. An extensive parameter is a parameter whose value is proportional to the size of the system (number of particles), an intensive parameter is a parameter that is independent of the system size.
Let's summarize the thermodynamic potential we have seen:
- Energy
- Free Energy
- Enthalpy
- Grand Potential
We have expressed all of these potentials in a differential form, where the number of elements depends on the number of ways to change the system's energy. Each term involves one extensive parameter and one intensive parameter. The pairs we have encountered so far are
, (
), (
), (
), where the first element of each pair is the intensive parameter and the second is the extensive one. The parameters under differential sign have a special meaning: when they are fixed, this thermo potential tends to minimum/maximum. For example:
const.
or
min when
= const.
In order to get from one potential to another one we simply need to add the proper pair of parameters to the first potential. For example, let's construct an ensemble where we fix the temperature, the number of particles and the pressure of the system. Like in the previous ensembles we'll look for a matching potential for our new ensemble and we shall see that our matching potential tends to a minimum.
![ \begin{matrix}
&G(\tau,p,N)=U(V,\sigma,N)+pV-\tau\sigma=H(p,\sigma,N)-\tau\sigma=F(V,\tau,N)+pV \\
&dG=-\sigma d\tau-Vdp+\mu dN
\end{matrix}]()
We attach to the system a heat-particle reservoir and will show that Gibbs potential is minimum at
,
and
- constant.
The total entropy
increase since
is a closed system.
We use Taylor expansion:
![ \begin{matrix}
&\sigma_{R}(U_{0}-U,V_{0}-V)+\sigma_{R}(U,V)\ \uparrow max \\
&\sigma_{R}(U_{0},V_{0})-\frac{\partial \sigma_{R}}{\partial U}|_{U_{0}}\ U-\frac{\partial \sigma_{R}}{\partial
V}|_{V_{0}}\ V+\sigma_{S}\ \uparrow max
\end{matrix}]()
Using Maxwell relations we get:
![ \begin{matrix}
&\left(\frac{\partial\sigma_{R}}{\partial U}\right)_{N,V}=\frac{1}{\tau}\\
&\left(\frac{\partial\sigma_{R}}{\partial U}\right)_{N,V}=\frac{p}{\tau} \\
&\underbrace{\sigma_{R}(U_{0},V_{0})}_{constant}-\frac{U}{\tau}-p\frac{V}{\tau}+\sigma_{S}\ \uparrow max
\end{matrix}]()
Now we multiply by
, so the expression should tend to minimum:
We call this potential Gibbs Free Energy.
Intensive Potentials[edit]
All of our potentials so far are extensive quantities. Sometimes we want to characterize the system by an intensive quantity with a meaning of thermodynamic potential. The easiest way define it is to divide the potential by an extensive parameter. If we divide the potential by, for example, N we'll get the potential per particle, which is an intensive size. We shall see now that in the special case of the potential G we'll get:
i.e.
is Gibbs free energy per particle
We start with the Energy (U):
The above equation simply states that the energy of a system is equal to the number of particles times the energy of one particle.
The same can be done with the Free Energy (F):
(The temperature is an intensive quantity so it's the same for every particle) Now we do the same to Gibbs Free Energy:
From the differential form of G we calculate the Chemical Potential:
From here we receive:
![ \begin{matrix}
&G=F+pV=U+pV-\tau\sigma=\mu N \\
&\Omega=F-\mu N=F-G=-pV
\end{matrix}]()
Phase transitions:[edit]
(example of liquid-vapor transition)
Consider vessel which contain water vapor with volume
and at low pressure so that the gas is an ideal gas. We start decrease the volume so the pressure increases:
.
In a certain point a small layer of water will appear and from this point, the following decreasing of volume wil not change the pressure, it will be constant. So what happens in the system? If we continue to reduce the volume, the water level will rise, but the pressure will remain constant. When all the vapor turn into water, reducing the volume will increase the pressure drastically and the proportion between the pressure and volume will change. In range of constant pressure we observe coexistence of two phases: liquid and gas.
The process we described above is done at a constant temperature. If we raise the temperature, the range of phase separation will shrink. But, if we raise the temperature high enough, we will have only a point of constant pressure. This temperature is called critical temperature, and for a phase transformation process at this temperature we don't have phase separation, we have everytime coexistence of gas and liquid, this named - fluid.
Theory of phase transition[edit]
Despite the complicated mathematical description like for example the BCS theory all known phase transitions like superconductivity, superfluidity or ferromagnetism are the result of the competition between the ordering interaction and the thermal fluctuations and they are similar to frequent attempts of falling out of the ping-pong ball in the hemispherical bowl or the box excited for example by the stream of air with the cooling fan or the vacuum cleaner. After exceeding the certain excitation intensity i.e. for the true case the critical temperature with the sufficiently strong stream of air the ball will stop randomly bounce from the walls of the bowl and it will fall out i.e. its order parameter which is its localization in or outside the bowl will undergo the phase transition. It is therefore the result of strong nonlinearity of motion which shows up when the system is randomly excited. The similar mechanism is responsible for "melting" of the ferromagnet i.e. for its total demagnetization with the thermal excitation above the Curie temperature when the interaction with the thermal reservoir is causing that the spin from small oscillations around the parallel direction of other spins starts randomly oscillate averaging to zero and ignoring the other spins around or when the thermal oscillations cause the ionization of Cooper pairs in the superconductor. For the Heisenberg model for example it is the pendular cosine scalar product interaction between the spins and the separatrix between two types of pendular spin motion in the external field which is responsible for the transition between the oscillatory (ordered) phase and the demagnetized or rotational phase with the critical temperature
or the energy between the pendulum up and down, close to its exact value from two dimensional Ising model given implicitly by
or
. Considering the spin as pendulum with the potential of the interaction with two other spins (with one above in the third dimension) one gets
close to its numerical value
obtained from the numerical Monte Carlo calculations and generally as interacting with one more for extra dimension
for four dimensions close to numerical
and
close to Bethe-Peierls-Weiss theory in
dimensions where it is

War on 'The Way We Live'
The June 30th edition of the left-wing Detroit Free Press carried an editorial titled "A war on climate change." Like most mass-media copmmentaries on the subject, it's a full endorsement of all the global warming hysteria and nonsense of the government-sponsored climate-change scam. The article starts with: Climate change is surely the looming disaster of our time. Scientists say it's inevitable that sea levels will rise 2 1/2 --6 1/2 feet--sufficient to endanger of wipe out many cities. One scientist believes that, in the long term, 69 feet of sea level rise is inescapable. This idea of disastrous sea level rise has been debunked many times in the past at sites like Watts Up With That by Anthony Watts among others. The article continues: And the source of the swelling oceans -- rising temperatures -- will stress the nation's food system while the increasing number of devastating storms will place an economic burden on a nation reeling from disaster to disaster,...(Read Full Article)COMEDY

mine aim is path contains a.txt it have to renamed to a_1.txt and have to delete the a.txt and a_1.txt have to rename to a.txt bt happening is
1) if that path contains a.txt
2) it is named to a_1.txt
3) its not deleting the a.txt and a_1.txt is not renamed to a.txt.
please suggest me by checking the above code.

Can you edit your post (click on the paper and pencil icon) and put your code into code tags. This will make it much easier to read.
It's difficult to read your code but the only code i could see that you might be using to delete a file is a call to deleteOnExit. This will not delete the file until you exit the JVM (i.e. your program finishes). Try using the delete method instead and see if that fixes your problem.

I dont think deleteOnExit works since the file is deleted only during the virtual machine termination.
More information can be found
here
you can try something like
delete
.
file is not renamed because a file with the same name already exists.

Hey, I have some suggestions/queries
1. Is this a standalone program? If yes then deleteOnExit should work since
your jvm will exit once you are done with your program.
2. If you intend to only renmae the file then why you are not using only
renameTo method in File Class.
3. I think variable newname should be reset in each iteration
4. Also its not clear what is to be done in case directory have all files
already renamed.
I have modified your code below with assumption that if both old and new file you wanted to create already exists then new file will be over-written.
import java.io.*; import java.util.*; public class renameFiles_1 { /** * DOCUMENT ME! */ public void Fliesrenamed() { String Path = "D:\\self\\pdf"; String newname = null; String newfilepath = ""; File f = new File(Path); try { if (f.exists()) { System.out.println("DEBUG -> Path Exists"); String[] fileslist = f.list(); System.out.println(fileslist.length); for (int i = 0; i < fileslist.length; i++) { newname = ""; System.out.println("DEBUG -> File Name: " + fileslist[i]); if ( + "::: ld path:::" + newpath + //":::new path:::"); File f1 = new File(oldpath); File f2 = new File(newpath); //If File with new name exists then try to delete that file boolean isDeleted = false; if(f2.exists()) { isDeleted = f2.delete(); } //If unable to delete then copy content of old file to new file if(!isDeleted) { System.out.println("DEBUG -> Trying to Copy Content"); BufferedReader br = new BufferedReader(new InputStreamReader(new FileInputStream(oldpath))); FileOutputStream out = new FileOutputStream(newpath); String temp; while((temp = br.readLine()) != null) { out.write(temp.getBytes()); } out.close(); br.close(); //Deleting original file f1.delete(); } else { System.out.println("DEBUG -> Renaming Original File"); f1.renameTo(f2); } } } } } catch (Exception e) { e.printStackTrace(); } } /** * DOCUMENT ME! * * @param args DOCUMENT ME! */ public static void main(String[] args) { renameFiles_1 ef = new renameFiles_1 (); ef.Fliesrenamed(); } }

Some suggestions to improve/simplify your code:
Use fileslist[i].endsWith(".pdf") instead of
(fileslist[i].substring(fileslist[i].length() - 4, fileslist[i].length())).equals(".pdf")
Use
File f1 = new File(f, fileslist[i]); File f2 = new File(f, newname);
instead of
String oldpath = Path + "\\" + fileslist[i]; String newpath = Path + "\\" + newname; File f1 = new File(oldpath); File f2 = new File(newpath);

- Carey Kinsolving Columnist
- 2003 19 Dec."
Richard is on the right track because an angel warned Joseph in a dream to flee to Egypt. Herod, the Jewish king, wasn't exactly thrilled when wise men from the East showed up asking, "Where is he who has been born King of the Jews?"
If Jesus had come with great fanfare, King Herod could have sent his soldiers to a specific house in Bethlehem. Instead, he ordered the massacre of all children in Bethlehem 2 years and younger.
"God sent our Savior as a baby because he wanted to show us that God is our Mighty God and that even a baby could lead us to the right path," says Karly, 11.
"The mystery of godliness" is a biblical phrase used to describe the ultimate paradox. Who can comprehend the depth of the descent Jesus experienced when he left the glories of heaven where angels continually praise God to enter a world dominated by people who live apart from God?. And, of course,. The Bible pulls back the curtain on another realm where an angel announced the birth of the Savior to shepherds watching over their flocks by night.
The greatest drama in all history unfolded that night in Bethlehem, yet VIPs were conspicuously absent. The Roman emperor probably had never heard of Bethlehem. Even for the majority of residents in this small, obscure town, it was just: "Christ himself was like God in everything. He was equal with God. But he did not think that being equal with God was something to be held on to. He gave up his place with God and made himself nothing. He was born to be a man and became like a servant.
"And when he was living as a man, he humbled himself and was fully obedient to God. He obeyed even when that caused his death -- death on a cross" (Philippians 2:6-8).
Thanks be to God for his indescribable gift.
Merry Christmas!
Point to ponder: Almighty God sent his Son to this Earth as a baby born into humble circumstances. Scripture to remember: "He gave up his place with God and made himself nothing" (Philippians 2:7). Questions to consider: If God's Son humbled himself for us, shouldn't we be more concerned about His reputation than our own? Are you embarrassed to let people know you are a Christian?

You’ll remember that the Rose and Crown menu went through an overhaul last Spring, and this year there are a few more changes and updates.
I boycotted last year after they took away the Roast Dinner and Yorkshire Pudding, but I figured it was time to throw in the towel and head back for another visit!
We’ll highlight some of the menu changes in a bit, but first let’s take a look around and get a feel for this cozy spot.
Atmosphere
Step up to the Rose and Crown, and you’ll experience some of Disney’s most authentic themeing. This place truly does feel like it’s on the corner of the High Street in an English town — at least in my experience!
Here, you’ll find a pub fronting the establishment, and a full restaurant in the back. You can stop into the pub for a simple menu (like the English Bulldog and Scotch Eggs we highlighted previously…be still my heart), or choose the restaurant for a more robust meal.
To the side of the entrance, you’ll find the dining check-in area as well as a kiosk to get a draft beer as you’re passing by.
Head into the pub area and you’re treated to an authentic set-up complete with a few pub tables and seating. Order your eats and drinks from the bar here.
And if you’re lucky enough to go to the pub on a weekday, you might get the chance to say Hello to Carl the Bartender — one of our favorite Disney cast members!
If you choose to dine in the restaurant, prepare for old-fashioned charm and coziness. Dark wood lines just about every surface in the place and guests are seated at tables and banquettes.
Stained glass emblems make sure you remember where you are, and bubbly leaded window glass elsewhere delivers an old world feel.
Should you choose to go after one of the most epic Disney dining experiences in the World, the outside front patio is your destination!
With one of the best views of Illuminations in the World Showcase, the Rose and Crown front patio is a veeeery hot ticket during the fireworks. You may be able to see the fireworks a teensy bit from the inside tables…but outside is your goal.
Here are the coveted front patio tables. There are a few more situated down below (see the striped umbrellas), which give an even better and broader view of the fireworks.
How do you get one of these tables? Perseverance. Book an early reservation, request a front patio table when you check in, and cross your fingers. (I’ve practically seen people come to blows over these tables, so bring your A-game or choose to dine at La Hacienda de San Angel for the show instead.)
Note that you can see some of the fireworks from this side patio, but the view isn’t nearly as incredible as it is from the front patio due to the awning stretched over the area.
This is why I recommend you don’t just request “patio” seating; instead, make sure you request a fireworks-view table on the front patio.
BUT, if all you want is some fun British-y food in a themed restaurant, definitely go for lunch to avoid all the crazy that happens at night with the table battles and what not!
Eats
As we mentioned, the Rose and Crown restaurant menu seems to change up regularly; but the pub menu has stayed relatively consistent for the past year or so. Here are a few of the eats you can get (with no dining reservation) in the pub section of Rose and Crown!
We do LOVE that Trio of United Kingdom Cheeses and the English Bulldog, as I mentioned!
A strong menu of beers, ales, lagers, stouts, Scotch, and more makes up the rest of the Pub menu; but the place is a full-service bar so you can get anything that strikes your fancy.
On my recent visit, however, we headed into the restaurant for a full lunch meal. As I said, the menu was similar to last Spring’s incarnation, with a few changes and updates. The vegetarian pie has replaced the Salmon dish from last year; and the steak is slightly different.
They also changed out the Pub Burger for an “English Breakfast Burger;” more on that later!
The day had been a bit rough up until this point for us, so we started out with a (truly lovely — don’t you want to just dive in?!?) Irish Coffee!
Smooth, mellow, and topped with a generous helping of whipped cream, this was a great way to relax and rejuvenate in the middle of a hectic Disney day.
And though the menu now lists a very vague and general “Seasonal Soup” in the appetizer section, it turned out to be the Potato and Leek Soup…which is what I’ve always had at Rose and Crown.
(More and more I’m starting to realize that when Disney ever lists a “seasonal soup” on the menu, it’s pretty much the same one all the time. Chicken and Wild Rice at Sleepy Hollow, Vegetable at Rosie’s, and now Potato and Leek at Rose and Crown. I mean, MAYBE it switches up from time to time, but it’s rare. Interesting observation we’ll have to watch…)
Sadly, this is still the “new” version of the Potato and Leek Soup and not the 100%-Cream-And-Butter version they used to have at R&C…which I was in love with and wanted to marry. But this version isn’t bad, and it did hit the spot on this cold day in Epcot! It’s creamy, savory, and would be just fine if I wasn’t comparing it to its former glory.
Now, on to that English Breakfast Burger I told you about!
Another Disney food trend seems to be burgers-with-eggs-on-them. We recently had the Bacon and Egg Burger from the new menu at Whispering Canyon Cafe, and now we see this version on the new R&C menu.
It’s described as an Angus Beef Patty with Applewood Smoked Bacon, Cheddar, Fried Egg, and Homemade HP Sauce. Fun, right?
I wanted to take a few close-ups for you, because the burger really was appealing to look at! The bacon was very thick-cut and hearty, the cheddar had a gorgeous color and bubbly, melty look, and the veggies seemed fresh and colorful.
And the burger was pretty good! I’m not a huge fried egg fan, but the flavors and textures all mixed together really did offer an intriguing and unique experience. And the homemade HP sauce was a great accent!
Overall, it was quite a good burger in and of itself (patty-wise), and the added flavors made it something special.
Now, alongside the burger was this thing…
What is it? you ask. Well, it’s a fried pickle, of course! (I actually had to ask our server what it was…I had no idea. Just goes to show I’m clearly not Southern…or English, I guess!)
Pickle lovers will adore this!
The next entree took us back to classic Rose and Crown! I remember Cottage Pie being on the menu when I came to Disney World with my family during my childhood.
In fact, my family’s experience with Cottage Pie eventually got me reprimanded and sent to bed with no dinner at one point…but that’s a different story for a different day!
For those who haven’t had it, Cottage Pie is a big ol’ mixture of ground beef, onions, mushrooms, and occasionally other veggies all topped off with creamy mashed potatoes and cheese. Here’s an inside shot!
The Cottage Pie was a relatively small portion for what I typically expect from Disney, so note that if this is on your menu to-do list!
We couldn’t head back out into the cold without dessert, so we requested the menu… (I still have never gotten the Jaffa Tarts here; if anyone has had them and has a pic, will you share it with me? I’m dying to know what they look like “homemade.”)
We went for an old classic — the Sticky Toffee Pudding, and a new recommendation from our server — the Queen’s Cake.
The Sticky Toffee Pudding was just as good as it always is. I was pleased with the amount of sauce we got here, too! The cake is spongy and pudding-y — very moist; and the combo of the Butter-Rum and vanilla custard sauces creates a warm, gooey, butterscotchy goodness.
The Queen’s Cake is apparently Rose & Crown’s version of the “fancy desserts” Disney’s been adding to menus hither and thither.
I always love Flourless Chocolate Cake, because it’s usually very moist and dense…and uber chocolatey! This version was good, but I’ve taken to rating World Showcase desserts based on a scale of how much I’d rather go have a No Way Jose Sundae at Beaches and Cream instead of this, and the Queen’s cake didn’t cut it.
The eggnog shooter (yep — that’s how much came in the shot glass…was it supposed to be full do you think?) was interesting. Thick and creamy with a slight alcohol taste. A slight milkshakey feel. Nothing I would write home about.
My favorite part of the trio was that little tiny bit of cherry compote there at the end, believe it or not! I’m a huge sour cherry fan, and this hit the spot. Wish I could have gotten a big bowl of cherry compote and vanilla cream. Yummo!
(UPDATE! Thanks to reader Robin S. for sharing a pic of the Jaffa Tarts with us!! See below!)
Overall
Rose and Crown — despite constant menu changes — remains one of my preferred restaurants in the World Showcase.
The place is so cozy and welcoming, and the food is rarely too pretentious. It’s good comfort food in a great atmosphere, usually accompanied by decent service and enjoyable cast members. When you find relative consistency like that in a Disney restaurant, be sure to relish it!
And while the prices do keep creeping up, you can still get a very generous table-service meal here for under $20 — and that’s a recommendation in itself.
I’m looking forward to hearing your thoughts and experiences from Rose & Crown in Epcot!
Have you been to Rose & Crown Pub or Restaurant? Let us know your thoughts in the comments below!
I am from England and I have never seen a deep fried pickle either !!
Can’t wait till next week when we will be there for Flower and Garden festival and all things Disney.
I also remember the cottage pie from the early 90’s. I loved it so much that it has been a staple meal in our home all these years. Back then you received a decent portion. I was thrilled when it returned to the menu and tried it last year. I thought it was a tiny portion for the price and I found it a bit too sweet. It could have been overly sweet carrots as the cause but I didn’t care for the meal at all. My husband got fish and chips and received one smaller sized piece of fish and a couple fries. (The meal was 1/2 the size of the meal he received before they changed the menu). Luckily we are not big eaters at all but based on our last meal normal eaters would have left hungry.
I love Rose and Crown but it makes me sad that the prices keep going up, portions and quality have gone down in my experience.
I was excited to see this article! We’ll be celebrating our 15th anniversary while we are there. If I go early enough to put in that request — and let them know it’s a special occasion, I wonder if we’ll get a good table? When you mention that people fuss over the tables, how can that be? Don’t servers take you to your table? If seating is assigned, how could someone battle over the table? (Just trying to be prepared!)
Thanks!
I went this past September and LOVED the cottage pie! We tried to get one of the coveted Illuminations-view tables but were sadly seated inside. To my surprise, they have a special section they rope off for indoor guests to go out and view the show. Even though it was standing room only, it was still a spectacular view and much better than trying to fight for a spot elsewhere. Plus, since the show occurred in the middle of our meal, we were able to go out and watch the show then come back and enjoy our desserts instead of rushing to finish before the show started.
I was there last September with my family and we unfortunately got an inside table for Illuminations. We were a bit bummed but our Server told us that they have a special section roped off for diners that are in the resturant and still want to see Illuminations. The only “problem” was we had to stand the whole time. We were able to eat our main course, walk down and watch Illuminations then go back in for dessert. It was a great experience!
This is our favorite WDW restaurant! Always a first night tradition!
Ohhh thank you for this! I am heading to Disney tomorrow night and that breakfast burger is now on my list!
I want my Mushrooms back…. But the Cottage pie looks good. Do you know if they still do candied pecans with the Cheese Tray?
As a local, I love to drop by the Rose & Crown at the end of an evening at Epcot. It’s so charming, and you nailed the point about comfort food! I have encountered 3 different seasonal soups there within the last year: a tomato bisque with croutons, a squash soup (butternut, I believe?) and the potato and leek. All 3 of them are quite delicious! I regret that I don’t better remember which “season” is which, though.
I remember waaaayyy back when, at least 8 years ago it must be, when they had a lamb soup that was to die for! I wish it was still there!! Sadly I went here two days ago and was kind of disappointed. The scotch egg was good but the salad served with it was so salty it felt like they had over seasoned it. The fish and chips came with a pretty good size piece of fish but most of my breading was mushy, as were the other servings at the table. I loved the flavor of the pudding but we all remarked that the plating didn’t have much flair. However, props to the drink menu, and especially the signature cocktails with fun Irish names and tasty combos!
Have there been big changes to the dinner menu? We have ADR for April and hoping to be able to get a front Patio table. Is 7:50 pm too late to get a table?
Clara — Ha ha! Have so much fun in Disney World next week!
Tracy — I was pretty surprised at what seemed like a small size on that cottage pie. Thanks for sharing your experience!
Chris — Yay! Happy Anniversary! Definitely arrive for your reservation early and put in the request with the note that it’s your anniversary. When I say they “battle,” I mean that the line to check in for the restaurant can get very long at around 7:30-8:30pm with people hoping to get those patio tables; and I’ve seen folks elbowed and cut in line to get up to the podium faster. I’ve also heard nasty comments made to those who have taken up patio tables for extended periods to make sure they see the fireworks. There seems to be a lot of stress that goes along with wanting those coveted tables.
Elyssa H. and Lauren — Thanks for sharing your experience! From what I can tell, that area where they direct inside guests is a small private event space so it may not always be available for viewing if there happens to be an event. I’m so glad you were lucky!! That’s awesome!
Christa M. — That’s great! Let us know some of your favorite dishes for next time!
Rachel — Yay! Enjoy, and safe travels!
Tricia — Not sure on the candied pecans! I’ll have to get the cheese tray again and check it out.
Ellen — Awesome! Thank you for the heads’ up on the soup schedule!! I would enjoy any of those!
Julie — So glad you enjoyed the drinks, but bummer on the rest! Maybe you’ll have another chance to check it out while you’re in Orlando…Disney restaurants are so inconsistent, so I’d love to hear your thoughts on a return visit if you go.
Jess — I didn’t get a peek at the dinner menu on this visit, but you can check it out here:. You never know on thost patio tables. Arrive about 30 minutes early and request a front patio table.
I love their original Pub Burger. I told hubby that we had to go back for lunch just so I could get a burger – now they changed it? It now sounds unbelievable! I HAVE to go back for this. I also adore fried pickles!
The staff and service are always BRILLIANT. But what is that menu about? Even the Brits don’t eat Scotch Eggs (not since the 70’s anyway) and a battered pickle??!! I’m nearly 50, British, and have never heard of that ever. Battered Mars Bar, yes, in Scotland, but never a pickle. Thank you so much for your wonderful review. I LOVE them. Very informative. What a wonderful job you have.
On behalf of vegetarians everywhere – I have to say I am glad to see the vegetable curry go to recipe heaven. It was by far the most disappointing thing I ate last year on our DW trip. A “vegetable stone pie” sounds promising though!
The waiters here are great ALWAYS though – Make sure to get a beer flight – then ask what their favorite “and black” beverage combination is… By the time we were done, I didn’t care about the “meh” curry.
That looks like a perfect fried egg. Yum!
I don’t think of fried pickles as particularly English, but they are delicious when washed down with a pint!
What time would be a good reservation time if you are hoping to be there for Illuminations?
Just ate here for the first time after the princess half marathon, we loved it! I got there and requested and sit outside and we were front and center the front row! They even came over to my daughter and request that she “start” the fireworks! It was a great night! Oh we all had the soup and I had the chicken curry which was so delicious and a huge portion!
Josephine we went at 730 and the fireworks were at 9. The waitress even asked us if she should go slower so we could watch them!
Grand Floridian Cafe used to serve fried pickles with the Grand sandwich. Back before the GF sandwich changed from being an open-faced boursin and onion-straw topped wonder to being enclosed in that awful, too-thick focaccia bread. Those were the days (early 90s).
To Jo, Scotch Eggs are a big, big deal at the moment in Britain, they’re probably one of the most fashionable items on menus at the moment. I challenege you to find a gastropub in the uk that doesn’t have a variation of a scotch egg on it’s menu.
Just a bit of trivia here.
Our waitress at BOP told us that Cottage pie is always hamburger and shepherds pie is always lamb. I didn’t know that just thought some called it shep. some called it cottage.
The Veg. Stone pie is like a very dense savory cheesecake / quiche served cool with a small salad on the side. not bad I was just expecting something warm. Was pretty good once I got over that it was cold.
Are here in June for the first time. Went back a second time on this trip. Loved the Scoth Egg, Bangers and Mash, Corned Beef Sandwich and especially the Sticky Toffee Pudding! Friendly service, fun atmosphere and great food!To the Editor:
Scandal. Corruption. Fraud. Sex Crimes. No, this is not a new segment of "Keeping Up With the Kardashians." This is everyday life in Albany, home of pay to play politics. We need to clean up state government and we need to do it now. That's why I, along with my fellow elected District Attorneys across the state of New York, support the Public Trust Act (the "Act") proposed by Gov. Andrew Cuomo. The Act addresses a number of areas where weak state laws have allowed public corruption and fraud to flourish in our state. State government has become a joke and public confidence in Albany is at an all-time low. In the last seven years alone, 32 New York officials have been involved in some kind of corruption or other criminal offense.
The Governor's Public Trust Act strengthens the offenses of bribery and bribe receiving, and creates tough anti-fraud laws. This legislation sends a strong message to Albany that it's time to address the public's desire for reform. We can't and won't accept "business as usual" in state government any longer. Here in Onondaga County, we are fortunate to be represented by public servants with integrity. Sens. John DeFrancisco and David Valesky, and Assemblymen Will Barclay, Gary Finch, Bill Magnarelli, Al Stirpe and Sam Roberts work tirelessly and represent this community honestly in Albany. But they can't do it alone.
This new law amends the bribery statutes, making them higher level felonies, and punishes offers to bribe as well as actual bribes. In other words, it treats an "intent to influence" as seriously as an actual bribe. For the first time, this law also makes failure to report a bribe offer to the district attorney a misdemeanor criminal offense.
Currently under New York state law, there is only one degree of Official Misconduct, an A misdemeanor. The governor's proposal elevates the Class A misdemeanor to a Class E felony, even where there is no benefit to the perpetrators or when the benefit can't be valued. It also proposes two new degrees of felony official misconduct: a D felony where the benefit grained is more than $1,000, and a C felony where the benefit gained is more than $3,000. This law also creates a new crime of Corrupting the Government. This new offense would apply to ongoing, systematic schemes to defraud the government, regardless of whether the perpetrator is a public official. Four degrees of this crime would be created, ranging from an E level felony to a B level felony, depending on the value of the benefit the perpetrator received.
This legislation (PDF) also creates the crime of Public Corruption. The thought behind this offense recognizes that crimes committed by public officials or against public entities have a far-reaching impact and should be penalized accordingly. Public Corruption would also apply regardless of whether the perpetrator was a public official, or a criminal targeting a public entity. This section of the law will also tighten the penalties associated with public corruption-related crimes. It increases the maximum level of fines that can be levied up to three times the amount of the defendant's gain for the crime of corrupting the government.
Finally, the Public Trust Act would bar an individual convicted of any crime involving bribery, official misconduct, or corruption from registering as a lobbyist or serving in a civil office. It also disqualifies individual and corporate offenders from bidding on and obtaining state contracts when convicted of crimes set forth in the Public Trust Act.
I applaud Gov. Cuomo's initiative and his efforts to clean up Albany. I, along with my fellow District Attorneys, are calling on all of our legislators to pass the governor's Public Trust Act swiftly and without compromise. The citizens of this great state are sick of the scandals. They are disgusted by the depth of corruption and fraud. They yearn for good government and honest public officials who look out for them and the public good, not line their pockets, defraud taxpayers, and reward themselves with opulent gifts paid for by other people looking for favors.

A direct mail piece dropped in early March targeting 54,000 students. It contained a pitch letter and a detachable request form with three options: Students who said "yes" could obtain a CD-ROM about the academy; a "maybe" option included a request for an admissions officer to contact the student; and checking the "no" box would remove the student from the list. An online response option also was offered.
With the letter was a photo-packed, two-sided insert touting the "Academy Introduction Mission -- A Summer Program for Juniors." Testimonials appeared on both sides of the insert with the academy's requirements, benefits, application information and details regarding an average week.
"When a prospective student hears about the Coast Guard Academy, they might not have thought it was an opportunity," said Sabra Fiala, direct marketing executive at Stamats, Cedar Rapids, IA, which created and executed the campaign for the Coast Guard Academy, New London, CT. "When you think of a military academy, they might have thought there is a congressional appointment needed or other hoops to jump through."
Images on the outer envelope included a helicopter and crew members on a ship hoisting the U.S. flag.
"When we were thinking of how we would position this, we really had to be very specific about one thing -- this academy plays a crucial role in homeland security," Fiala said.
Campaign results were broken down between male and female respondents. The U.S. Postal Service returned 2,500 pieces with incorrect addresses, which were not counted in the results. Males who said "yes" or "maybe" reached 720 out of 35,166 for a 2.05 percent response. For females, 463 of 16,334 said "yes" or "maybe" for a 2.83 percent response. Of the 1,297 students who responded, 1,095 said "yes," 88 "maybe" and 114 "no." The Web option drew 409 responses while the request form generated 888. The response goal was 2 percent.
"Having the 'no' option on the tear-away was significant because it's important for us to get them off the radar if they are not interested since we don't want to devote any additional resources if they are not interested [because of] the expense involved," Fiala said. "The Web option was important because a lot of these kids are on the computer constantly, and you may be talking about kids who have never turned in a handwritten term paper in their life."
Four lists were used:
· Students taking the PSAT with A-plus to A-minus grades with an engineering major indicated for their college selection.
· A list obtained from the College Bound Selection Service that included juniors with an A-plus to A-minus grade range who indicated the selection of Advanced Placement courses in high school, were interested in an International B.A. or had been involved in advanced or honors programs and had indicated future majors of military science, engineering or military college/academy/ROTC.
· Those who took the ACT Plan test.
· A list from the National Research Center for College and University Admissions.
"We're playing on the fact that their achievements make them a qualified candidate," Fiala said. "At the very beginning, the letter talks about unexpected opportunities which are life changing. It also pointed out the free tuition and room and board. We're trying to make them understand that not just anybody can get in."
The piece targeted male and female students differently. The letter to females read: "You're probably saying to yourself, 'Wow, I didn't think very many girls would go there.' Most young women don't think of us right away. ... In fact, 30 percent of our cadets are women."
Supporting the effort was a postcard mailed a few weeks earlier to 5,000 parents of the targeted juniors. Those parents were selected randomly as part of a test.

So far, no one has been hurt.

Sorry, no cute pictures, coffee or funny links ... just your basic dailies.
I'd rather be back in the dream I was having about an incredible new house DH and I were moving into, with multi-level rooms, huge gardens and more. But instead, I'm getting ready to head out into the cold for 16 miles this morning. The plan calls for the last 30 minutes to be at "moderate effort." Wish me luck!
Have a great Saturday, runners!

Supp Shari! The only thing required is a title so you're good!
I have a tempo run on tap later this morning, and I would really like to nail it as my last one gave me all kinds of crap.
Right now though, I am enjoying the pre-dawn silence of the world. It is my most favorite time of the day, and it will get better once I pop a k-cup into the machine!
Know thyself
Go figure
Step...Glad you were liking your dreams. I, on the other hand, was on a plane that was continually being diverted and making repeated, harrowing emergency landings! Have a great run, and enjoy that moderate effort portion. So far with my Hudson training, I've found that those segments are a lot harder in my head than in reality.
LRB...Good luck with today's tempo. Just for me, the biggest thing I can do to make a tempo run better is to not be too fast on the first interval. Usually, if I control that, the rest is pretty good. Now if the weather wants to be crappy or something like that, then what I choose to do really doesn't matter much.
As for me, I'm off to meet the running group for 9 miles. Then, we're doing a 5k prediction run that's actually being held for a RWOL member as a secret fundraiser. I'm hoping the turnout is good.

Me - don't know if I'll get a run in today or not, but if I do, it's just going to be 3 or 4 easy miles. I'm visiting family and sometimes, my brother in law makes plans but doesn't tell everyone until the last minute. Today is his day off, so I suspect that he'll have something up his sleeve. It'll be fun though.

Morning! I have a shakeout run tonight. 5 miles with strides. Off to the expo at 10am and then to watch Die Hard 5 with my husband. The cold front is coming! The cold front is coming! Feels like of 37F at start time! I am waiting for somebody to pinch me and say: "Gotcha! Your marathon is in the 80s!"
Shari, enjoy your 16 miles and sorry about the dream. Hope it comes true.
LRB, enjoy your tempo run.
SIAR, hope your 9 goes well.
D2, enjoy your 15 miles.
flarunner, nice 12. Did the cold front arrived over there. We'll be freezing tomorrow morning. I cannot wait!
Shirfan, enjoy the 10+ tempo miles. DH and I also do not go on V Day. It's too crowded everywhere. Best time to go is before or after, IMO. Glad you guys had time to enjoy each other.
Sparker, enjoy your 4.

Good Saturday Morning, porkchops! Same old stuff today. If I was running, I reckon I'd take to the treadmill today due to the snow we got last night. I'm not running though, so it don't matter. Maybe I'll hop in the car and venture out in the snow. I'm getting a little stir crazy here.

The Four Corners region could be facing a hazy future. A massive, new coal-fired power plant planned for the region is undergoing review, and the public is being asked to comment on the proposal.
The $2 billion plant would be the third coal-burning plant in the San Juan Basin. It would be built on the Navajo Nation roughly 20 miles south of Kirtland and has been tagged the Desert Rock Project. It's estimated that the plant would generate enough energy for 1.5 million homes.
"It's a very large plant at 1,500 megawatts," said Dan Randolph of San Juan Citizens' Alliance,
A fourth, smaller plant, named the Mustang Project, is also seeking approval to begin construction between Farmington and Grants, N.M. Originally, the plant was expected to be operational by next year, but there have been delays. Mustang has categorically refused to consider alternative and environmentally friendly technologies, yet recently received a $20 million subsidy under President Bush's so-called Clear Skies Initiative.
While these plants are not within La Plata County's viewshed, they are well within its airshed, according to Randolph. Plus, local air quality is already significantly impacted by the two existing power plants in northern New Mexico.
"A good respiratory health study for the basin has not been done at all," Randolph said. "Before we put more smoke up in the air, we should know what the impacts already are."
The Bureau of Indian Affairs has invited the public to submit written comments through Dec. 17 on the Desert Rock plant. There is also one public hearing planned in the region and it will take place Tuesday, Dec. 7, at the Farmington Civic Center.
"At this point, there is only one public meeting scheduled locally," Randolph said. "We're pushing for an additional meeting in Shiprock."
Randolph concluded that this scoping period is an opportunity for locals to raise issues they would like to have addressed during the review process. Written comments can be sent through Dec. 17 to: Eloise Chicharello, director, Navajo Regional Office, Bureau of Indian Affairs, P.O. Box 1060, Gallup, N.M., 87305.
Buena Vista voters repeal RGI
One of the poster children for Durango's proposed Responsible Growth Initiative has gone away. On Nov. 2, Buena Vista voters repealed an initiative that required a popular vote for large annexations. It had been in existence for five years and touted as a success story by proponents of Durango's similar measure, which was also rejected by voters Nov. 2.
Buena Vista resident Randy Loback told the Denver Post that easing development restrictions was the only way to keep the town from dying. Loback noted that residents, "used to be concerned about what's affecting them now. I think a lot of people have turned their thoughts to the long term. What's good for their kids?"
In particular, Buena Vista residents were interested in boosting sales tax revenues by attracting commercial properties. The Post noted that residents have realized that the summer tourism economy is not enough for Buena Vista.
"We have young people graduating who have to move because there's very little here in terms of finding jobs that can pay for you to live," said Mayor Sharyle Solis.
Public lands "passport" in works
Bikers, hikers and all users of public lands may have to start carrying a "passport" when they recreate. An Ohio congressman has successfully pushed a measure through Congress that would require members of the public to purchase an "America the Beautiful" pass to recreate on all land managed by the Forest Service, Bureau of Land Management, U.S. Fish & Wildlife Service, and Bureau of Reclamation.
Ralph Regula, R-Ohio, succeeded in attaching his bill as a rider to the giant Omnibus Appropriations Bill recently enacted in the lame duck session of Congress. The bill was never passed by the House and was never introduced, given a hearing or voted upon in the Senate. Omnibus bills are considered "must pass" legislation because of the potential for a government shutdown.
Regula's bill, HR 3283, allows the federal land management agencies to charge access fees for recreational use of public lands by the general public. The bill has been highly controversial and is opposed by hundreds of organizations, state legislatures, county governments and members of the public.
"This was a victory of pork over principle," said Robert Funkhouser, president of the Western Slope No-Fee Coalition. "Ralph Regula is responsible for the first tax increase of the Bush administration."
The Regula bill will go into effect when Fee Demo expires at the beginning of fiscal year 2005 unless the new congress acts to derail it. Failure to carry the pass will be a criminal offense punishable by up to $5,000 and/or six months in jail. The America the Beautiful Pass is expected to cost between $85 and $100 annually.
"This is an abuse of position by Congressman Regula" according to Funkhouser. "Changing public land policy in the middle of the night via a rider is despicable. Once again the congressman has proven to be hostile to rural and Western values and will stop at nothing to push his agenda."
Fugitive pot grower nabbed
Members of the Southwest Drug Task Force recently concluded a three-year investigation with the arrest of former La Plata County resident Edward Pole. Pole was arrested on Thursday in Humble, Texas, after evading officers since December 2001. Pole was involved with a "sophisticated" marijuana cultivation operation located at the La Plata County home of Lynn Crandall. Crandall and Pole had been charged in U.S. District Court with charges related to conspiracy to manufacture marijuana, conspiracy to distribute marijuana and money laundering.
According to investigators, Pole is believed to have traveled to Canada, Panama and Costa Rica after learning about the December 2001 bust. The task force was able to locate Pole in Texas after he re-entered the United States several months ago.
The Southwest Drug Task Force is a multi-jurisdictional investigative body comprised of the La Plata County Sheriffs Office, Ignacio Police Department and the Colorado Bureau of Investigation. The Southwest Drug Task Force routinely files criminal cases in both Colorado State Court and the U.S. Federal Court System.

New mortgage-lending rules take hold Friday that federal regulators say will guard against the risky lending practices that fed the housing bubble, which led to the greatest collapse in U.S. home prices since the Great Depression..
Impact Analysis
For most home loan borrowers, the change will have little or no impact on whether they can actually get a mortgage, experts say, but they may have to show even more proof that they can afford one.
Many analyst are saying that these rules makes it more harder to consumer to get loan which is already tough right now. The real estate and mortgage industry, the CFPB, and others will watch implementation of the new rules closely to determine whether they make it more difficult for borrowers to qualify for mortgages.
These new rules makes it even more difficult for borrowers who have fluctuating incomes or self-employed individuals to validate their incomes like myself. It was more difficult and now it got to the point of near impossible. I am sure they need tons of papers to qualify for self employed. The 43 percent debt standard also may prove a hurdle for some borrowers who find they can’t qualify for the loan they need to buy the house they want, and some borrowers may find they need larger down payments to keep within that 43 percent rule..”
In conclusion, changes are inevitable and they are always difficult but if the change is made to make certain thing better and safer, than there should be no harm following it. CFBU was created for the main purpose to help and protect consumers and if these rules are set out to protect consumer from getting caught in bad debt, it is a good thing. It surely make different for consumers to go thorough more hurdles to get their loan but if they are really serious and legitimate they will persist and go for it. That’s surely the motive to avoid bad loans to bad consumers which will eventually avoid big crisis.
If you are home buyer, better work with educated mortgage broker or lender to get the processing started ahead of time and avoid any last minute surprises and give more time than usual to get your loan processed.Pharmaceuticals

Audio accessories maker Skullcandy is boosting its quarterly dividend by 9% to $0.12 for a new annual yield of 3.9%. At just 9.3 times this year's earnings, and with plenty of merger-related benefits from store closures in the Office Depot/OfficeMax merger, Staples still appears to be an exceptional value.
Also in the news...
You're probably tired of the faux soap opera, "Dell's of our Lives," but the news streaming out of this leveraged buyout continues to get more interesting by the week. We learned yesterday, according to CNBC, that activist investor Carl Icahn has taken a 100 million share (or 6%) interest in Dell. Known for his hands-on approach to investing, Dell investors like myself are excited that he may team up with Dell's other large shareholders to seek out a better deal. Unless Dell is willing to sweeten the pot with a special dividend, it's looking increasingly likely that it'll need to organize a heftier bid if it wants shareholders to tender their shares.
Speaking of investors taking large positions, a 13G filing with the SEC and brought to light by MarketWatch notes that Citadel Investment Group, which is run by Ken Griffin, owns a 4.6 million share stake, or 5% of outstanding shares, in QLogic . I would like to think that Griffin's fund sees the same value and growth blend that I see in QLogic, including its $5.45 in cash per share with no debt, and clear signs from the fiber-optic sector that telecom service providers are boosting their capital expenditures. QLogic was able to boost its EPS and sales estimates well beyond Wall Street's last quarter and I'll be looking for a repeat in the upcoming quarter.
Finally, struggling international mobile service provider France Telecom received some analyst love on Monday in the form of an upgrade by Morgan Stanley from underweight to overweight. Morgan Stanley believes that France Telecom's costs are flattening and that a French price war in mobile is already priced into its shares. With big mobile subsidies on the horizon, Morgan Stanley projected 20% near-term, and perhaps 50% longer-term, upside to France Telecom's shares. With a yield over 10% and more than $3 billion in free cash flow expected this year, it's hard to argue with Morgan Stanley's analysis.

At this time is an interesting bit of provenance about El Bulli. In 1961, Dr. Dennes Schilling and any wife visited the town of Rose bushes located near Cala Montjoi in Catalonia, Spain and fell in love with the area. They subsequently purchased a piece off land at Cala Montjoi, and decided to set up a mini-golf system. The Schillings owned various French bulldogs of most a breed informally referred to in "bulli"--thus the identity for their business, "El Bulli," happened to be derived.

I think Black Elk summed up things well below. Chancellor knows enough that should horrify him & that he should write openly about. But if he truly steps out of his safe zone & castigates the Family, he will be removed from 'most favored' theologian status & not have access . . . & as an aloof & 'fair-minded' academic 'impartially' chronicling the Family & recording history, continued access is paramount, if he wants his name attached to theirs as the expert who gave his expert opinion on a controversial NRM.
But what dear Mr. Chancellor must know in the troubled conscience below his exterior is that in the process of 'expertly' presenting their history, he is wittingly or unwittingly expediting their acceptance & expediting the whitewash coverup of their sordid past.
No,no, he says to Jules, if ever my day in court comes, I will speak the truth even of the bad stuff I have seen and been told.
Yeah, right.
In the meantime, let's see about being a big expert who wittingly or unwittingly helps cover up their past in the media. Funny that a Baptist theologian can be so fair-minded & impartial about the horror he must read of victim's testimonies on MovingOn.
Oh. He doesn't read them.
But to balance all this, I admire Monger who is willing to point out that Chancellor is trying, in his own way, to be fair. I don't see Monger's opinions as a 'tile' put out, & I think it's ridiculous to chide someone for giving a contrary opinion, whether I fully agree with him on every point or not.
Chancellor has not (to my knowledge at least) sunk as low as Gordon (slip-me-some-cash) Meltdown.Two-thousand years of biblical history lay buried 14 meters beneath the Lutheran Church of the Redeemer in Jerusalem. German archeologist Dieter Vieweger led the excavation of the site.
A Herodian quarry, the remains of Golgotha, buildings from the period of the Roman Emperor Hadrian, mosaics from the Church of Saint Maria Latina: At the end of 2012, the Archeological Park was opened under the Lutheran Church of the Redeemer in Jerusalem, giving visitors the chance to take a tour of these locations and understand the city's colorful past. German archeologist Dieter Vieweger spent three years building the park together with a team of students and experts.
DW: Mr Vieweger, as a professor of biblical archeology at the Ecclesiastical University Wuppertal you were unable to spend Christmas vacation in Jerusalem. Did you miss it?
Dieter Vieweger: Yes, because it's very nice to celebrate Christmas Mass in Jerusalem and then walk into the night and arrive in Bethlehem, Jesus' birthplace, in the early morning and then to take part in a prayer service. I always imagine that that was the hour of Jesus' birth. I've done that a number of times over the past few years and it was always a very meaningful Christmas celebration for me..
Herod also played a central role as a child murderer in biblical history. Shortly before the birth of Jesus, he is said to have ordered the murder of all male babies. Does the biblical figure correlate with the historical facts?
Herod was actually a security fanatic and persecuted people relentlessly. He murdered his wife and his son. Anyone who became too dangerous to him personally or could pose a threat to his status as "Herod the Great," was eliminated. Whether or not the murder of babies, as it is described in the Bible, is historically accurate, we don't know, but it fits his personality.
The era of Herod is just a part of the Archeological Park. What fascinates visitors most about the project?
When they come to the Church of the Redeemer and go 14 meters underground, then they see that the over-ground city of Jerusalem with its city walls from the 16th century isn't really that old. Also, that the most substantial part of the history of the 4,000-year-old city is buried under layers beneath the earth. To be able to walk through history is really fun for visitors because it's something entirely new. There's never been anything like this in Jerusalem before.
Was it difficult to realize the project in light of the rapid pace of political developments and the conflict between the Israelis and the Palestinians?
Alongside the archeological concern of how the excavations under the Church of the Redeemer should be carried out without damaging the structure and the question of how to finance the archeological park, was the primary problem that all archeologists in Jerusalem have. We are not allowed to carry out research excavations because a part of the city is occupied territory.
We can continue with existing excavations, so that they are accessible or carry out rescue excavations when houses collapse. Then we can investigate. And that's exactly what we did with this project. Unfortunately, however, there were a few questions we weren't able to pursue. We would like to have known how the second north city wall, built by Herod just a few meters from the Church of the Redeemer, actually looked. We could have dug up some very interesting things that, unfortunately, we had to leave buried in the soil.
To what extent is your work affected by the conflict?
Actually, the security situation is a lot better than is often communicated in the German media. But naturally I witness the tension in both Palestinian and Israeli society. There are always demonstrations in Jerusalem. There are clashes.
But as a foreigner I have to stand back. Of course I can try to mediate between the two sides, but the conflicts have to be resolved by local people. The place where I live, wonderfully situated on the Mount of Olives, provides a welcome retreat for me. The students who assist the excavations, and also live with me for a short time, are often astounded by how calm it is at our institute on the Mount of Olives.
A few years ago you published a book titled "Streit ums heilige Land" ("Battle for the Holy Land"), something you continually witness first-hand. What in your opinion has to happen in order for peace to be restored in the region?
I think that Israelis, like Palestinians, need to pull back their demands to about 20 percent. If both sides don't stop demanding everything then at some point they'll be a big crack and it'll be World War Three. For me, the two-state solution is a chance for peace. It would mean that both parties would really have to take care of their own problems, and that each party has to come to grips with what it demands and what it may demand under UN law. Two separate, sovereign states could bring peace to the region.
Archaeologists have long been drawn to Turkey as a center of human civilization for thousands of years. The Turkish government has launched an aggressive policy seeking to bring back Turkish artifacts housed elsewhere. (26.09.2012)
With Syria engulfed by war, the destruction of numerous archeological excavation sites may appear insignificant. But important historical evidence of ancient civilization is threatened with destruction. (27.08.2012)All year we see commercials about "the race to the FedEx Cup." The Golf Channel anchors are forced to talk about it like it's the World Cup, and we are made to believe that every golfer on the PGA Tour circles this weekend as their one last chance at glory.
Obviously none of that is true. None of it. If the FedEx Cup mattered at all, we'd at least get live coverage of the stupid thing. Nope. The final round of the final tournament, where a handful of guys have a chance to walk away with the $10 million prize won't even be shown live.
The reason for the early start is thunderstorms in the Atlanta area, but if all these outlets are going to shove this thing in our face for nine months, they better find a way to give us at the edge of our seat a chance to see who can actually do this in real time. Instead, we can read about it, and then watch the "drama" unfold on NBC later that day.
It's ridiculous, but it's a perfect example of just how incredibly pointless the FedEx Cup really is. The players care about four events called majors. They want to win the other big tournaments, like the Memorial and Bay Hill, and anyone would love to snag an extra eight figures before the season ends. But it isn't really that important. It obviously isn't.
I have an idea for 2011. Since the FedEx Cup really "heats up" during football season, why not have the events end on Monday. Sure, people are at work during that time, but it would at least give these tournaments a chance to shine without interference.
This is the point where I write something like, "things need to change ... something has to be done," but really, does anyone care? It's an attempt to make post-major golf interesting, and it has failed. Whatever changes they make won't help. Tiger Woods being in the field wouldn't help. It just isn't that interesting.
We root for Tiger in majors because it is a chase against history. The FedEx Cup will never be relevant to the history of golfers because none of the people before them had a chance at it. It's merely a failed project that needs to go away, much like the XFL experiment.
Someone wake me up when the Ryder Cup kicks off.

The Peres is part of an Indiegogo fundraising campaign, but you can preorder from the regular site, with projected delivery in July 2014.

Delhibirding at Okhla
A particularly hot Sunday morning, the stench of the Yamuna and the recent disquiet from yesterday's tragic blasts did not deter the Sunday outing of Delhibird to Okhla Bird Sanctuary, geographically in Uttar Pradesh, but only about half hour drive from the national capital.
A chance meeting with Gopi Sundar who studies Sarus Cranes and a co-incidental phone call from Anshu of Delhibirds regarding the outing made it possible for me to join the group to Okhla. We left Delhi at 5.40 AM and reached Okhla at 6 AM. The twitching of the Lesser Whitethroat and the ammoniacal odours of the Yamuna welcomed us (For those who think I am overstenching the Yamuna, see quote of the day below). We parked within Okhla and walked down the trail with agricultural fields on one side and dry marsh land with tall grass on the other with the 'pie' of male bushchats every few metres apart. A lone Common Babbler on the trail ahead excited me quite a bit, we southerners not having this 'common' cousin of our babblers.
We reached the end of the trail overlooks the Yamuna waters with tall grass, a few settlements and stray cattle separating us from the water. Somebody pointed out a large bird perched at a distance and the day started. Even as the scope was being set up, several binocs went up and a tentative diagnosis of a hepatic female cuckoo was announced. The barring on the upper tail, its
large size and the very fine nature of the barring on the underparts was bringing Eurasian Cuckoo in my mind. The scope brought some clarity - the yellowish bill and the plumage indicated that it was a juvenile. The throat had relatively lesser streaking and the underparts were also quite dark with the fine barring. With a lingering doubt in everyone's mind, we settled for juv. Greybellied Cuckoo. A few record shots from the photgrapher friends will settle the id soon perhaps.
A courageous group of delhibirders turned waders and waded through some water, vegetation and whatnot to reach the water. They were rewarded with Blacktailed Godwits, Ruffs and several other waterbirds. Just then, we all had seen a female Marsh Harrier and even as I was about to mention Migrantwatch, KB Singh informed me that he would be logging it into MW
today! The other group which stayed put were witness to an Rufousbacked Shrikes, an oriole in flight, red munias and black drongos. On the other bank, meanwhile were over a hundred terns, mostly whiskered with some river terns fishing. As we returned, Gopi scoped a few Spotted Owlets roosting in a Banyan tree nearby. A Greater Spotted Eagle and a Pariah kite circling
together as we walked back was another highlight of the morning.
It was a great opportunity to meet some birders from Delhi. It's amazing how many of them have heard so much about BR Hills. The recent photographs from BR Hills had made it even more of a top destination for many of them. Between the harriers and the munias, the conversation moved from Migrantwatch to the top-ten photographers announced by Kolkatabirds and slowly strayed away to idlis and dosas, and at some point, we all dispersed
to Sagar restaurant in Noida, where I gulped down the most expensive idlis of my life. As all breakfast convos go, this one too was unmatched in its width of topics - conservation policy, judiciary, ethics, choice of 'spirits' and what not!
A morning well spent with delhibird members and I look forward to birding again with them whenever I visit Delhi.

1. Buy Kringle Candles – These new candles are made with only 100% pure food-grade paraffin. Paraffin wax is refined from naturally-occurring crude oil, the product of animal and vegetable matter that has been locked inside the Earth for millions of years and refined into more useable products including fabrics, plastics, etc. Virtually all of Kringle’s paraffin is domestically-produced. Check out the selection at their store in Bernardston.
2. Patronize a “green” restaurant – Several Pioneer Valley restaurants “go green” every day by serving their patrons menu items that have been prepared incorporating fresh fruits, vegetables and assorted produce from local farms and purveyors. Some examples are Carmelina’s at the Commons in Hadley, Sylvester’s and Roberto’s Restaurants in Northampton, Chandler’s Restaurant in South Deerfield and The Federal in Agawam, just to name a few.
3. Support “green” companies – There are many Pioneer Valley businesses that are committed to implementing environmentally-friendly business practices. The Economic Development Council of Western MA lists several of them here.
4. Flag a Green Cab – This terrific hybrid cabs service Northampton, Amherst, Holyoke, Westfield and surrounding towns 365 days a year. The Green Cab Company features Ford Escape Hybrid vehicles, the most fuel-efficient SUV on the market.
5. Use public transportation – Peter Pan buses can get you where you’re going with ease and comfort, King Ward coach lines are ideal for chartering trips and group events, and the Pioneer Valley Transit Authority (the largest regional transit authority in Massachusetts) has buses running all through the Valley.

Nothing is more frustrating than being greeted with a nasty Service Bulletin, and have no history behind it. Therefore, here’s the rationale behind the required inspection:
In late January, I received a report from an Acclaim owner in Poland that they had experienced a separation of the Empennage hinge assembly from the Empennage bulkhead. It happened shortly after takeoff. The pilot reported that at about 200’ AGL, he encountered some magnitude of vertical shear, heard a loud bang in the tail, and the aircraft pitched nose up. With the assistance of another pilot in the right seat, the two of them managed to push the nose down enough, with throttle control, to land the airplane safely. My hat is off to these two pilots to say the least. Upon examination, it was found that the rear hinge, filler plate, and Jack screw lug had pulled apart from the Empennage bulkhead, Huck pins and all. The collars were found inside the stinger. I had the hardware shipped to me for investigation. I had pictures of the empennage sent too. The pictures revealed that the filler plate had been installed on the wrong side of the hinge. In the correct stack up, the hinge has a .032” surface milled above the hinge pivot. The hinge is then installed with a .040” filler plate that sits between the hinge and the bulkhead. The purpose here is twofold: One, it holds the hinge pivot off the bulkhead .008” to allow rotation of the hinge plate without galling the bulkhead. Second, it keeps the hinge parallel to the bulkhead, minimizing shear forces on the Huck pin. Our working theory was that without the filler plate between the hinge and bulkhead, the installed pins would not pull up perpendicular to the bulkhead, and the collars would not swedge properly. Also, with the .040” filler still in the stack, there was now an added .032” gap added to the lower row of Hucks, changing the grip length. Our theory was that this had allowed the hinge to “work” on the bulkhead, thereby allowing the Huck pins to loosen in their holes. Add a vertical gust load, and the lower Huck pins and collars would have failed first, then pulling the upper pins loose due to the lever action.
This was done in conjunction with FAA Engineers, whom I contacted immediately after receiving the hardware and pictures from Poland and determining there was more to this than wind shear. I am required (and would do it anyway, ask anyone who knows me) to report a failure such as this to the FAA within 24 hours of determining that the failure was one that is covered by FAR 21.3.
Mooney and FAA agreed that an AD should be issued, and due to the failure mode, it should be an immediate Emergency AD based on our Service Bulletin M20-313. With that accomplished, it was discovered that the next sequential S/N produced after the Polish airplane was incorrect also. Service Bulletin M20-314 was issued to put the airplane(s) back to Type Design. This new result was not like the previous, as there were no signs of movement in the assembly, it was just put together improperly. The only common factor we could find was that the same assembler has assembled both tails on the same day, and the same inspector had signed off on the installation. So we set the effectivity at the beginning of this installer’s tenure in the Empennage shop, and went back from there 10 airframes, just to be sure. We also made test coupons and tested our Huck guns for proper pull and swedging. All passed.
Weeks went by, and the Confirmation cards flooded in. All were reported inspected and proper, with good collar swedges on the Huck collars. I was starting to thing we had caught the only two, when another TN was reported to be found incorrect. This one was built by the same assembler, exactly one year to the day before the original two were produced. I have no idea what that tells us, but the confident feeling was leaving me. Two days later, an Eagle eyed mechanic at one of our Service Center’s called me to tell me that he was doing an Annual on a 1990 J Model, and thought he’d just take a look at the hinge. It was incorrect. This airplane had 1400 hours on it. I visited the airplane, and found no movement of the hinge, and good Huck bolt installations. My feeling is that it would have flown forever in that condition, no problems. However, it wasn’t right, it wasn’t to Type Design, and it had to be corrected. So, yet another call was made to FAA, their Engineers came out again, and we now had to try to isolate an effectivity once again. Inspection records from 1990 showed that another assembler had built the J Model’s tail. That means we had lost the common denominator used to set the original effectivity. Next stop was the Stinger assembly drawing to see if there was a change in construction in the past that would allow us to point at a specific time when we knew that all was well. Turns out that the hinge mounting hasn’t changed since 1961, with the introduction of the M20B.
This is where my job gets hard. We have nothing to correlate the improper assembly to. We still do not know the root cause of the failure in Poland, or why the others that have been identified have not loosened up like that one did. I have nothing that I can set an effectivity to after the initial design that is in use today. Therefore, I have decided that ALL airframes need to be looked at. The design is better than good, calculated to withstand 10 times ultimate load, and actually tested to 1.8 timed positive and negative gust Ultimate load. There has NEVER been a reported failure of this assembly, until the one in Poland. Even that one was flown to a safe landing. The chatter about the Empennage falling off is incorrect. The primary attach points are the Empennage pivot point and the elevator control rods. The hinge’s primary job is to allow for longitudinal trim, and to stabilize the Empennage laterally.
I have had to do this before. But I did it without hesitation, because it was the right thing to do.
Inspecting your airplanes is also the right thing to do. We absolutely have to know that this issue does not exist anywhere else. YOU absolutely have to know that this issue does not exist anywhere else. It’s going to cost you an hour of labor to have that peace of mind. You may curse me for making you do it. But at least you’ll be around to curse me, and that’s what matters most to all of us here at Mooney.

Where to go in Northern Mexico?
My friend and I are considering a trip to northern Mexico sometime in late July or early August. Could anyone recommend a good place/places to visit? We probably would only be there for a couple of days. We live in Texas and haven't every really been to visit the neighbors so to speak. She's been to Nuevo Laredo but that's it. It will take us about 8 or 10 hours to get to the border so we wouldn't want to go TOO far into Mexico. I looked at some info about Monterrey but its a bit far and a bit...big city. What would you recommend?

The super-block is built when the file system is created (\c .I newfs (8)) and never changes. The super-block contains the basic parameters of the file system, such as the number of data blocks it contains and a count of the maximum number of files. Because the super-block contains critical data, .I newfs replicates it to protect against catastrophic loss. The .I "default super block" always resides at a fixed offset from the beginning of the file system's disk partition. The .I "redundant super blocks" are not referenced unless a head crash or other hard disk error causes the default super-block to be unusable. The redundant blocks are sprinkled throughout the disk partition. .PP Within the file system are files. Certain files are distinguished as directories and contain collections of pointers to files that may themselves be directories. Every file has a descriptor associated with it called an .I "inode". The inode contains information describing ownership of the file, time stamps indicating modification and access times for the file, and an array of indices pointing to the data blocks for the file. In this section, we assume that the first 12 blocks of the file are directly referenced by values stored in the inode structure itself\(dg. .FS \(dgThe actual number may vary from system to system, but is usually in the range 5-13. .FE The inode structure may also contain references to indirect blocks containing further data block indices. In a file system with a 4096 byte block size, a singly indirect block contains 1024 further block addresses, a doubly indirect block contains 1024 addresses of further single indirect blocks, and a triply indirect block contains 1024 addresses of further doubly indirect blocks (the triple indirect block is never needed in practice). .PP In order to create files with up to 2\(ua32 bytes, using of different block sizes to be accessible simultaneously on the same system. The block size must be decided when .I newfs creates the file system; the block size cannot be subsequently changed without rebuilding the file system. .NH 2 Summary information .PP Associated with the super block is non replicated .I "summary information" . The summary information changes as the file system is modified. The summary information contains the number of blocks, fragments, inodes and directories in the file system. .NH 2 Cylinder groups .PP The file system partitions the disk into one or more areas called .I "cylinder groups". A cylinder group is comprised of one or more consecutive cylinders on a disk. Each cylinder group includes inode slots for files, a .I "block map" describing available blocks in the cylinder group, and summary information describing the usage of data blocks within the cylinder group. A fixed number of inodes is allocated for each cylinder group when the file system is created. The current policy is to allocate one inode for each 2048 bytes of disk space; this is expected to be far more inodes than will ever be needed. .PP All the cylinder group bookkeeping information could be placed at the beginning of each cylinder group. However if this approach were used, all the redundant information would be on the top platter. A single hardware failure that destroyed the top platter could cause the loss of all copies of the redundant super-blocks. Thus the cylinder group bookkeeping information begins at a floating offset from the beginning of the cylinder group. The offset for the .I "i+1" st cylinder group is about one track further from the beginning of the cylinder group than it was for the .I "i" th cylinder group. In this way, the redundant information spirals down into the pack; any single track, cylinder, or platter can be lost without losing all copies of the super-blocks. Except for the first cylinder group, the space between the beginning of the cylinder group and the beginning of the cylinder group information stores data. .NH 2 Fragments .PP To avoid waste in storing small files, the file system space allocator divides a single file system block into one or more .I "fragments". The fragmentation of the file system is specified when the file system is created; each file system block can be optionally broken into 2, 4, or 8 addressable fragments. The lower bound on the size of these fragments is constrained by the disk sector size; typically 512 bytes is the lower bound on fragment size. The block map associated with each cylinder group records the space availability at the fragment level. Aligned fragments are examined to determine block availability. . For example, consider an 11000 byte file stored on a 4096/1024 byte file system. This file uses two full size blocks and a 3072 byte fragment. If no fragments with at least 3072 bytes are available when the file is created, a full size block is split yielding the necessary 3072 byte fragment and an unused 1024 byte fragment. This remaining fragment can be allocated to another file, as needed. .NH 2 Updates to the file system .PP Every working day hundreds of files are created, modified, and removed. Every time a file is modified, the operating system performs a series of file system updates. These updates, when written on disk, yield a consistent file system. The file system stages all modifications of critical information; modification can either be completed or cleanly backed out after a crash. Knowing the information that is first written to the file system, deterministic procedures can be developed to repair a corrupted file system. To understand this process, the order that the update requests were being honored must first be understood. .PP When a user program does an operation to change the file system, such as a .I write , the data to be written is copied into an internal .I "in-core" buffer in the kernel. Normally, the disk update is handled asynchronously; the user process is allowed to proceed even though the data has not yet been written to the disk. The data, along with the inode information reflecting the change, is eventually written out to disk. The real disk write may not happen until long after the .I write system call has returned. Thus at any given time, the file system, as it resides on the disk, lags the state of the file system represented by the in-core information. .PP The disk information is updated to reflect the in-core information when the buffer is required for another use, when a .I sync (2) is done (at 30 second intervals) by .I "/etc/update" "(8)," or by manual operator intervention with the .I sync (8) command. If the system is halted without writing out the in-core information, the file system on the disk will be in an inconsistent state. .PP If all updates are done asynchronously, several serious inconsistencies can arise. One inconsistency is that a block may be claimed by two inodes. Such an inconsistency can occur when the system is halted before the pointer to the block in the old inode has been cleared in the copy of the old inode on the disk, and after the pointer to the block in the new inode has been written out to the copy of the new inode on the disk. Here, there is no deterministic method for deciding which inode should really claim the block. A similar problem can arise with a multiply claimed inode. .PP The problem with asynchronous inode updates can be avoided by doing all inode deallocations synchronously. Consequently, inodes and indirect blocks are written to the disk synchronously (\fIi.e.\fP the process blocks until the information is really written to disk) when they are being deallocated. Similarly inodes are kept consistent by synchronously deleting, adding, or changing directory entries. .ds RH Fixing corrupted file systemsOrder Arava With No Prescription, Arava Over The Counter, Purchase Arava Online No Prescription, Buy Arava No Prescription, Buy Cheap Arava, Canada, Mexico, India, Where Can I Find Arava Online, Arava Samples, Fast Shipping Arava, Order Arava From Mexican Pharmacy, Buy Arava Without Prescription, Buy Arava Online No Prescription, Buy Arava Without A Prescription, Buy Generic Arava, Buy Arava No Prescription, Australia, Uk, Us, Usa, Comprar En Línea Arava, Comprar Arava Baratos, Arava Samples, Where Can I Buy Cheapest Arava Online, Order Arava Online Overnight Delivery No Prescription, Where Can I Find Arava Online, Buy Arava From Canada, Kjøpe Arava På Nett, Köpa Arava Online, Buy Arava From Mexico, Arava From Canadian Pharmacy, Ordering Arava Online, Order Arava From Mexican Pharmacy, Arava Trusted Pharmacy Reviews, Buy Arava Online Cod, Arava Over The Counter, Buy No Prescription Arava Online, Where Can I Buy Arava Online, Arava Gel, Ointment, Cream, Pill, Spray, Continuous-release, Extended-release, Purchase Arava Online No Prescription, Buy Cheap Arava No Rx, Buying Arava Online Over The Counter » Trusted Online Pharmacy

French president Francois Hollande said Sunday, after declaring a nationwide terror alert in France, “"We've already held back the progress of our adversaries and inflicted heavy losses on them...Our mission is not over yet.” A French pilot was killed Saturday when his helicopter was shot down. More than 100 people, both rebel and government troops, were killed Saturday - most in the army’s re-conquest of the key town of Konna with French support. Cote d'Ivoire President Alassane Ouattara, ECOS chairman, has decided to deploy some 3,300 African soldiers, starting Monday. The multinational force is expected to be headed by Nigerian Maj. Gen. Shehu Abdulkadir. Burkina Faso, Niger and Senegal each offer 500 soldiers. Al Qaeda has threatened to execute at least eight hostages unless France ends its military intervention in Mali and Somalia.
Britain is sending two transport planes, believed to be C-17s, to be deployed in Mali within 24-48 hours and Washington is considering intelligence-sharing and logistical aid.Swedbank AB, the largest lender in the Baltic states, plans to cut costs by 1 billion kronor ($150 million) this year after reporting a 65 percent drop in fourth- quarter profit.
Net income fell to 965 million kronor from 2.75 billion kronor a year earlier, the Stockholm-based bank said today in a statement. That beat the 891 million-kronor average estimate of analysts surveyed by SME Direkt.
Swedbank wrote down 1.91 billion kronor of goodwill at its Latvian business and took a staff restructuring charge of 330 million kronor. Chief Executive Officer Michael Wolf plans to cut costs further this year as the lender guards against the risk of a recession in Europe.
“The current macroeconomic outlook is very uncertain and there is a clear risk of recession in Europe,” Wolf said in the statement. “We are planning a weak scenario and are focusing on cost development.”
Swedbank fell 1.4 percent to 104.10 kronor as of 9:10 a.m. in Stockholm trading, paring this year’s gain to 17 percent. The company proposed a dividend of 5.3 kronor a share, more than the 5 kronor estimated by analysts in a Bloomberg survey.
Capital Requirements
Sweden, home to four of the Nordic region’s six biggest banks, wants its lenders to follow stricter capital standards than those set out by the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision.
Swedbank’s core Tier 1 capital ratio was 15.7 percent for the period under Basel 2, compared with 13.9 percent a year earlier. The lender said it needs a core Tier 1 capital ratio of 13.5 percent to 14.5 percent because of tougher regulations and withdrew its current target of at least 13 percent until 2013.
Net interest income, the difference between what the bank earns from lending and what it pays on deposits, jumped 10 percent to 4.99 billion kronor in the quarter, while its net commission income slipped 16 percent to 2.13 billion kronor. An economic recovery in the Baltic region allowed Swedbank to recoup 174 million kronor in bad-loan provisions in the quarter, it said.

Vengeance is his.
Ah, a direct-to-DVD cop movie starring Jean-Claude Van Damme. I knew what to expect. Some shootouts, a brainless script, Van Damme ignoring the fact that he's too old to be a martial arts hero, and not enough breaks in the action to care.
But that's not what Until Death is. It starts out that way, but imagine my surprise as it gradually started to grab my attention, and accomplished so much more. If nothing else, Until Death is the most ambitious B-grade action flick I've seen in a long time, despite some weak moments. I think I may even be about to write a positive review.
Anthony Stowe (Jean-Claude Van Damme, Hard Target) is a tough cop with a bad attitude, some bad habits, and a criminal ex-partner (Stephen Rea, V for Vendetta) whom he wants to bring down for good. He's quickly running out of allies, though, thanks to his despicable behavior on and off the job. He's also alienated his wife Valerie (Selina Giles, V for Vendetta), who is now pregnant with another man's child. But all downward spirals end somewhere, and Anthony's ends when he lands in a coma and has plenty of time to think through his life. It's time to make things right, but he's got a lot of enemies to deal with first.
For its first half hour, Until Death runs like any other action cop flick. It has a couple of bland shootouts, punctuated by some of the most blatant disregard for police procedure that I have ever seen. Anthony is completely unlikeable, Stephen Rea disappears entirely after the first scene, and too much time is wasted on arguments and posturing between Anthony and the other cops. New characters are introduced and dismissed just as quickly, as a severe shortage of action sets in. I began to write a scathing review in my head.
But then, as the film developed, some key things started to change. First, there were several really impressive set pieces. The later action scenes don't feel like direct-to-video fare, and several deserve individual mention. A shootout in a restaurant is edited with a steady hand, perfectly balancing suspense with clarity. A massive shootout at the end is even better, making good use of location and camera angles. Characters don't have bottomless ammo magazines, nor do enemies appear from nowhere. Van Damme is also satisfied to keep to the shooting. He realizes that he's no longer a martial arts hero, and doesn't try to relive the glory days.
This is also one of Van Damme's better performances. At first, he just seems pissed off and grouchy, but it makes more sense as the character starts to change. His first few adjustments are well performed, as Anthony realizes that he wants to change, but is trapped in cycles that he himself has created. As he tries to make restitution for the horrible things he has done, I actually found myself getting attached to the character. Van Damme will never be a great actor, but this performance shows a lot more talent than I ever expected to see.
I can't help wondering what Until Death would have been like had it been made by more capable hands. This is fine work for Simon Fellows, whose most famous credit to date is 2004's Blessed. Judge David Johnson found the same to be true of Second in Command, Fellows and Van Damme's previous collaboration. And you know what? Some major script adjustments and Antoine Fuqua at the helm could have turned Until Death into a very solid cops-and-robbers movie. A more skilled support cast and a more charismatic leading man could have gotten me hooked from the opening scene. As it stands, Until Death is a bit of a paradox: It's an overly ambitious trash movie, that does almost none of the things that make trash movies appealing. It doesn't handle the characters and plot well enough to work as a compelling story, but it also lacks the humor and camp that makes these direct-to-video films palatable. In the end, it sits trapped in the middle, unlikely to ever find a real audience. In a way, that's too bad, because action-craving audiences could do a lot worse.
Sony realized that Until Death is never going to make it big in any circles. Like any film that will soon sink to the bottom of video store PV sections, no special effort has been extended here. The technical quality of the disc is quite high, featuring a slick 2.35:1 image and a bass-thumping, ear-popping, well-mixed 5.1 audio track. It looks and feels much bigger than it actually is, which helps. In the extras department, Sony doesn't even bother pretending. There are about a dozen trailers, but that's it.
I'll be honest. If you're browsing this web site, reading reviews to learn which great movies are hitting DVD these days, you could do a lot better than Until Death. It will mostly appeal to the masses of beer-swilling, beer-gutted men who rent anything with Jean-Claude Van Damme starring. It's almost good enough to warrant a stronger recommendation, though, thanks to some genuinely solid moments. I guess I'll file it as a slightly pleasant surprise. If you're an action junkie, give this one a shot. It might give you a taste for something more substantial. If you're looking for a film that will turn you into a member of the Van Damme club, this probably won't be enough. But at least it's better than Derailed.
What the heck. I'm going to let this one go free.

I've had no formal art training, although I've been painting for a number of years. At times, my work has taken a back seat to studying philosophy. I find engaging in both creates a necessary balance between head and heart.
I tend to take an experimental approach with my work, often tinkering with textures and layers until it adequately reflects the unconscious content I'm attempting to get out. Often, the characters in my work are either based on or provide the basis for central characters in my fiction writing.

Silverdale infant dies after East Bremerton collision
A 6-month-old infant injured in an Oct. 6 collision in East Bremerton died at Mary Bridge Children’s Hospital in Tacoma Oct. 8.
Enzo Williams, whose family is from Silverdale, was the only injury in a State Highway 303 collision that involved multiple family members, according to the Washington State Patrol. Enzo Williams sustained a fractured skull.
The Williams’ family Kia sedan was traveling north on Highway 303 near the intersection at Furney’s Lane when a Bremerton driver in a GMC SUV struck the Kia’s rear end. Enzo Williams was airlifted to Tacoma. No other injuries were reported.
Enzo died at the hospital at 6:01 p.m. Oct.C5 Group

An anti-corruption enforcement explosion is reaching across industries and around the globe. In the last few months, there has been an increase in the number of high profile enforcement actions, harsher penalties for both individuals and corporate offenders, and active cooperation among enforcement officials in various countries. Investigations in Europe and Latin America have led to investigations in the United States and Asia, and Canadian companies can no longer assume a Canadian safe haven.
US regulators are prosecuting companies engaged in corrupt practices simply because they are listed on a US exchange. This includes any interlisted Canadian corporation. Repercussions of an FCPA violation could include substantial fines, including disgorgement of profits, debarment from government contracting, delisting from exchanges, court appointed monitoring, civil lawsuits and imprisonment. Canadian companies can also be held responsible for corrupt practices engaged by their business partners, foreign subsidiaries and even local distributors.
With record-setting sanctions involving well-known companies, Canadian companies must now reassess their own anti-corruption measures to prevent lapses that might lead to damaging and costly enforcement actions. Having an effective and comprehensive corporate anti-corruption compliance policy in place will demonstrate to employees and, if necessary, law enforcement officials that your company considers anti corruption compliance an important corporate goal.
If done properly, a comprehensive compliance program can become a valuable corporate asset that enhances company operations, facilitates compliance with the law and mitigates damage when and if violations occur.
This publication from the “Canadian Forum on Bribery and Foreign Corruption – Compliance and Enforcement”, by the American Conference Institute and The Canadian Institute includes an exceptional faculty of seasoned corporate ethics and compliance executives, attorneys and government officials, who provide the latest information on:
- Actions -Michael Ferland was back in the Brandon lineup for their victory over Kamloops, contributing an assist in the Wheat Kings’ 6-4 victory over the Blazers.
Ferland has been sidelined since September 29th with a knee injury, missing 11 games and undergoing arthroscopic surgery on his left knee on October 7th.
“Coming here and seeing the guys again, it feels great,” said Ferland during Brandon’s off day in Cranbrook on Thursday, “Being on the road with them, playing the game again, it feel great to be back.”
Ferland was expected to be a top-six forward for the Wheat Kings this season but originally hurt his knee during the second day of training camp on September 2nd, with the injury causing him to miss all of his first NHL training camp with the Calgary Flames.
Ferland came back to Brandon and played in the club’s first three games of the regular season but he didn’t feel quite right, and it was then discovered that surgery would be needed.
Now, the 18-year old Brandon product is anxious to stay healthy, and have a productive 2010-2011 campaign.
“For sure. I hate injuries, it’s one of the biggest pet peeves ever,” says the 6-foor-2, 208 pound Ferland, “I just want to keep playing and, hopefully, stay healthy.”
Ferland has one goal and two points in four games this season after notching nine goals and 28 points in 61 games a year ago.
Meanwhile, David Toews is inching closer to returning after missing nine games with a high ankle sprain and rookie Jens Meilleur is also getting closer to getting into the lineup after suffering a broken hand during the final game of the pre-season.
Brandon will continue their road trip Friday night, when they pay a visit to the Eastern Conference leading Kootenay Ice (7:30 p.m., CKLQ).
Chaff…Last year, Brandon split four games with the Ice including a 1-1-0-0 record in Cranbrook…F Mark Stone has points in five of his last six games (4 G, 5 A)…D Brodie Melnychuk has four points (2 G, 2 A) in the last three games…F Jason Swyripa has points in three of the last four games (2 G, 2 A)…F Scott Glennie has five points (1 G, 4 A) in the last three games…after closing out their current road trip on Saturday in Lethbridge, the Wheat Kings will play seven of their next nine games on home ice starting with their November 5th matchup against Spokane.Legend Of The Gold Robot

The first time was at a church we were attending in Southern California, but we left before the results. The second time was recently at work.
The idea was that you get a group of people to volunteer to come forward with almost no idea why. And then you had each of them $100. You ask them to pray over the money and then do something with it for God's kingdom.
And the stories you get back are just amazing.
So they recently did that at work and two of the stories were pretty cool and I thought I'd share.
The first guy was business-minded and a little curious. Last year, one of the NASCAR cars was wrapped with our logo by a benefactor who wanted to expose our name to a new audience. He was a big NASCAR fan and a big World Vision fan but didn't think enough NASCAR fans knew about World Vision. So he paid to have one of his cars run that year with our logo on it, instead of the usual sponsors he'd normally get paid to have on his car.
Well, we had some collectible die-casts made of the car to commemorate the year and they were selling them to the staff. So he used a little of the money to buy one and put it on eBay just to see what would happen. It quickly was bid way up by NASCAR fans and so he bought another and another and another. They didn't say what the final amount he turned back over to World Vision was, but he suggested it could be a lucrative business.
Another guy got up and said he had no money to return, it was all spent. And then he went on to tell a fascinating story. The day before the money thing, his wife announced to him that she wanted to bake potatoes for homeless people and then drive around passing them out. He was wondering how they might pull that off when the next day he was handed $100.
So he went home, told his wife, they decided they needed to do something bigger. So they went down and talked to the guys who run our cafe. It's run by a homeless shelter and the guys who work in our cafe were homeless at one time. So they worked with them, recruited a bunch of co-workers and started doing "drive-by feedings." They ended up doing a number of them, they'd just go somewhere, setup and start serving meals to the homeless where they were. Even after their little experiment was over, the thing kept going. It became so big on its own that the shelter now has to employ someone full time to coordinate all the future drive-by feedings. Other homeless shelters even heard about it and three other shelters are now also doing them.
Thought that was pretty cool.SMOKEFREE Electronic Cigarette Offers 12% Discounts during the Diwali Week

- By Polly Wong | Comments Off
What is the difference between formal and informal writing? In order to write a letter you have to determine whether it is a personal letter or business one. The type of letter will determine the format and tone of the content.
It will also determine what type of paper and envelope the letter is sent in. All of the steps taken to create the letter reflect on you and must be considered when writing.
All letters should have an opening addressing who you are sending the letter to, a body in which you inform the person as to your reason for writing and a closing which tells the recipient who you are.
Formal Letter Writing
A business letter should be created on neutral colored paper such as beige or white. Use a standard letter-size of 8 ½ X 11 inch paper.
The envelope should match the color of the paper. Do not use bright patterns or colors. If writing from one business to another then it is acceptable to use your company logo or letterhead.
Before your opening address you should write your return address at the top, right-hand corner of the paper.
The mailing address of the recipient should be written just under this but to the far left-side of the paper.
For the body of a business letter, skip two lines from the address and write the date in long form.
No abbreviations should take place in a business letter. Skip two more lines before writing Sir or Madam or the correct name of the person you are writing to.
Skip two lines and state your purpose for writing the letter. Follow up the purpose by using the body of the letter to back up your statement.
Express the action you want the recipient to take in your closing paragraph. Stick with “Yours Sincerely” or simply “Yours Faithfully” if you do not know the recipient in the business letter.
Informal Letter Writing
A personal letter is much more informal. It normally includes “Dear so and so” or simply the recipient’s name.
Putting the date on the upper right hand corner may help the both of you remember when it was written.
The body is simply what you have to say to the recipient and does not need to follow any specific pattern.
It can contain a specific purpose for writing or simply an accounting of what has been going on in your life.
The closing of a letter contains things like “Yours Truly”, “Love”, “Best Wishes”, or even “God Bless”. You will never confuse on the type of letter after learning the difference between formal and informal writing.PreviousNext» Sample Complaint LetterLow-Fee Clinics

To achieve these goals, the 57-year-old Ripp spearheaded the development of an ambitious information management system that ties together 300 million summary-level P&Ls with multidimensional views by customer, industry, product, and country. And, ironically, after spending more than three years developing the system, he has become its ultimate end-user: earlier this year, Ripp was promoted to executive vice president of global businesses at the world’s largest supplier of electric and electronic connectors and connection systems.
Certainly the promotion is a testament to Ripp’s achievements as CFO. But it comes at a difficult time for AMP, which had $5.7 billion in revenues in 1997. The company has been hard hit by the financial crisis in Asia, where it does 20 percent of its business. It has also experienced slowdowns in some key industries, such as cellular phones, as well as pricing pressure in its bread-and-butter business, personal computers. The financial feedback system Ripp engineered, though, has helped AMP respond. “It has significantly changed the way we view the company,” he says. Over the past year and a half, AMP, buoyed by its internal information, has moved to globalize procurement and sourcing activities, moved production to low-cost regions, discontinued or raised prices on some low-volume parts, and implemented consolidation, all in an attempt to grow revenue and improve margins.
It was the move to global operations, in fact, that initially led to the overhaul of the information management systems. The company had a history of autonomous decentralized operations with a command-and-control leadership style. But the model was incompatible with the global market AMP pursued. Customers wanted a cohesive supplier with integrated services, and president and CEO Bill Hudson aimed to deliver. To refocus, though, the organization would have to be structured as a matrix, and managers would have to understand the global implications of day-to-day transactions. “AMP needed information that would facilitate faster, smarter decisions with a global perspective,” says Hudson, who tapped Ripp, a former controller at IBM Corp., for the task.
Ripp’s first question was, “Where’s our team of financial analysts?” But in 1994, the information system AMP had to facilitate financial decision making was almost nonexistent. The company had consolidated financial statements by geographical regions, but very little beyond that. There was nothing to gauge the profitability of different industries, products, or customer segmentations. “We needed to look at the financial returns of each industry [AMP supplies to] to make decisions about where we should be investing more resources,” says Ripp. But he couldn’t. What AMP did have was a handful of people who constructed consolidated financial summaries of 16 customers and 19 product groups on a quarterly basis, often two months after the books were closed. For a company with 90,000 customers and 100,000 individual part numbers, the analysis was barely skin deep.
The Lowest Level of Detail
Under Ripp’s leadership, AMP invested in a PC- based client/server infrastructure while moving its financial reporting away from a mainframe focus. Ripp assembled a team from IS and finance and arranged funding for the project. “The price tag [$2 million over three years] wasn’t that big, considering the scope of the project,” says Ripp.
Then, AMP selected Arbor Software Corp.’s Essbase to bring multidimensional reporting to the desktop in a production environment. But to make the data worthwhile, AMP needed to determine the lowest level of detail that could be summarized with a good level of accuracy. The sales statistics submitted by the local AMP companies, which summarized monthly part-number shipments to a customer’s location, provided the required granularity.
From there, local AMP companies were required to begin supplying data feeds to headquarters for centralized processing of sales, cost, and customer statistics. Worldwide networks and data warehouses were built. Process reengineering using SAP’s R/3 system as a framework was launched. Next, global coding structures were developed to consistently identify customers to global industry segments, and global product lines were established to consistently identify part numbers to global product segments.
Rather than wait for a complete solution, Ripp began to implement the system right away, with continuous improvement as the goal. “It wasn’t a perfect system in the beginning,” Ripp admits. “But we knew we had to get it off the ground and make the necessary modifications later on or we’d still be trying to figure out how to do an accurate P&L down on the part- number level.”
By 1997, the process had improved enough to allow AMP to collect country-supplied rates for all global product lines as part of the monthly-close process. One barrier that still remained, though, was the inconsistencies in the approaches companies used to assign expenses to products. “In 1998, we improved the process further by centralizing the generation of country statistics,” says Bill Urkiel, corporate vice president and CFO. “Today, we bring in country-supplied sales and standard cost at the part-number and customer-location level. And we apply expense numbers to the appropriate products with global standard allocation routines to ensure consistency. We closed the loop, which was one of the original requirements of our internal financial customers.”
For 1998, the Business Model P&L System is a closed process that stores 12 million records and provides monthly financial results from a single database. “We wanted to build a resource to get the company to focus not so much on data, but on information to facilitate decision making that is customer-focused instead of exclusively product-focused,” says Ripp. Going forward, AMP, which is currently weighing a $9.8 billion unsolicited bid from AlliedSignal Inc., believes the financial feedback system will help it navigate a difficult business environment. And in the longer term, it should make it a more responsive company. Ripp states simply: “What we say at AMP is, ‘Let the computers do all the heavy lifting.'”Gallery Paule Anglim is pleased to announce Remains to be Seen, an exhibition of works by Carolee Schneemann.
The exhibition will celebrate a career spanning five decades, presenting key works in video and photography enhanced by Schneemann's unique interventions with painting, collage and drawing. Providing a look at the breadth and layered history of her creativity, Remains to be Seen will include: "Unexpectedly Research" a story board assembled with images from the artist's films and performances interspersed with mythological and anthropological photos from antiquity; "Up to and Including Her Limits", a hand-painted photo document of her famous 3-dimensional drawing performance; and "Devour" a recent dual-channel video installation with collaged repeating images -- described by the artist as "a range of images which contrast evanescence, fragile elements with violent, concussive, speeding fragments... political disasters, domestic intimacy, and ambiguous menace."
Documents from Schneemann's archives, recently acquired by Stanford University, will be displayed as part of the exposition.
The artist will speak about her work at San Francisco Art Institute, November 14 at 7:30 pm.
Emerging from an environment of male-dominated Abstract Expressionism, Carolee Schneemann courageously redefined the arena of art by opening up the practice to movement, 3-dimensional space and the body (as driver of the imagery.) Allowing archetypal elements of sexuality, desire and even violence into the discourse, she created ground-breaking imagery that engaged art audiences in new ways. Film, and performance were melded with painting and drawing, revealing and embracing the action, motives and social context involved.
The recent retrospective exhibition tour, Carolee Schneemann: Within and Beyond the Premises traveled to the Dorsky Museum of Art, New York; the Henry Art Gallery in Seattle; and the Krannert Art Museum, the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. Her work was featured in On Line: Drawing Through the Twentieth Century at MoMA, New York, and other works have been exhibited at the Centre Pompidou, Paris and the Whitney Museum of American Art in New York.Hello again future colleagues!
It’s the end of June–which has flown by a little too fast–and although I am so excited for my first day of classes, I don’t want to forget about what I will be leaving behind: my boyfriend, my best friend, my comfort zone. Despite how much time I still have left before August 1 rolls around, I find my agenda book filling up quickly in an effort to tie up loose ends and visit friends and family before my departure. I really look forward to the third week of July when I’ll get a week off work to just relax and maybe go to the cottage.
One of my “loose ends” that I recently tied up was cancelling my gym membership, which was very sad. I really enjoy going to the gym, seeing the same people each morning in the fitness classes and knowing that we all share the same thoughts about doing another set of squats and lunges. Luckily, ICO has a gym conveniently located on campus for student use. I plan to be an avid user, but I take the laughter of my co-worker–a second year student at ICO–as a subtle hint that I may not have the time.
As I prepare for school, it seems my wardrobe is the most difficult thing to put together. It’s easy to imagine things I might need for my room, but when it comes to what I’ll be wearing every day, it seems to require more effort. And in terms of obtaining the required items, I keep having to remind myself that Chicago might possibly have much better shopping than Winnipeg. I found out about an outlet mall near Chicago that has countless stores where I am sure I could find anything that comes to mind.
Fendi 968 in red
This is about the time I would be due for my annual eye exam. However, I think we will be required to get one from the third year students some time in November–so I can wait until then to get my new prescription and hopefully that new Fendi frame I’ve had my eye on.
I have been making great use of the ICO Class of 2017 Facebook page and used it to connect with the other students from Winnipeg–I think there are six of us in total. Five us were able to meet for drinks at an outdoor patio on the most beautiful day I think we have had so far–weather hasn’t been too good this year. Aside from meeting my fellow Winnipeggers, I have been waiting patiently for my roommate assignment and look forward to connecting with her on Facebook.
Next week is my last week working in the optical dispensary; it is somewhat bittersweet. Bitter because I am going to miss all the wonderful staff and doctors there that have allowed me to shadow them and ask countless questions; sweet because I know that this is one more thing that needs to happen before leaving for school. Through working there, I’ve had the opportunity to shadow at our optical lab–they do the edging on our lenses imported from the Ontario office. The man I shadowed was very knowledgeable and showed me the whole edging process from start to finish. Now I finally understand why we pick small frames for high myopes. Another great trick I learned while dispensing is picking a square or round frame for people with a narrow PD–works like a charm for opening up their eyes.
I was born a planner, so I am always thinking one step ahead of myself and asking “What’s next?” Regarding my short-term planning, I’m pondering how I will spend next summer–our one and only summer vacation. I definitely want to participate in the private practice clerkship and I have arranged to do this at the optical dispensary where I have worked for the last year. The next question is, of course, do I want to spend the rest of it working my buns off to make some money, or do I want to take the time off to spend at the cottage or with friends? Maybe the best of both worlds would be to get a job out at the cottage–but because it’s only for two months, I doubt anyone would take me on.
Some long-term planning that I have been thinking about now involves considering doing a residency after graduation. From what I know about the programs so far, a residency in cornea and contact lenses interests me the most. I have also been thinking about what type of environment I would like to find employment in, be it a private practice, a partnership with an ophthalmologist, a hospital setting or even a large corporation. It seems there are so many options and avenues of opportunity available and unfortunately, I do not have the right experiences or knowledge under my belt to make these decisions yet.
Until next time, remember not to wish the time away and enjoy the summer because before you know it, it will be over.

In two previous studies, the researchers involved in this study found links between exercise, especially vigorous activity, and a lowered risk of death from prostate cancer or worsening of the disease. The goal of this study was to try to understand why exercise showed these benefits. The researchers looked at the gene expression in healthy prostate tissue from 70 men who had also completed a questionnaire about their exercise habits, including the amount and intensity of exercise.
The researchers found 184 genes that were expressed differently in men who participated in more vigorous exercise, such as jogging, tennis, or lap swimming, for at least three hours a week than in men who exercised less intensely, such as walking at any pace. Some of the genes that were expressed differently included the tumor suppressor genes (genes that can limit cancer growth) associated with breast cancer, BRCA1 and BRCA2. The results of this study show that vigorous exercise may help some genes work better at controlling cancer growth.
The study was led by Mark Jesus Magbanua, PhD [2], Associate Specialist in the Department of Medicine at the University of California, San Francisco and 2012 Conquer Cancer Foundation [3] of ASCO Merit Award recipient.
What this means for patients
“We previously found that men with prostate cancer who exercise tend to fare better after a diagnosis of prostate cancer, and now we are trying to understand why,” said senior author June Chan, ScD, Associate Professor, Epidemiology and Biostatistics and Urology, and the Steven and Christine Burd-Safeway Distinguished Professor at the University of California, San Francisco. “This was a small study with results that should be looked at cautiously and confirmed in larger studies. In the future, we hope this information could be used to help predict a patient's chance of recovery and the risk of the disease worsening.”
Questions to Ask Your Doctor
- What stage of prostate cancer do I have? What does this mean?
- What is my prognosis (chance of recovery)?
- What type of exercise program would you recommend for me?

Our Mission
To help small business owners take advantage of the IRS’s largest legal tax break, but one nearly impossible to prove in an audit. Their Mileage!
Background
Small business owners dread tax time - most want to do things the right way, but also want to pay the least amount in taxes. As Americans, our responsibility is to pay every penny we owe the government, but not a penny more! But every year, the simplest tax deduction - driving for work - gets the same response – a GUESS! Power Users, such as realtors, appraisers, and small business owners, drive thousands of miles for work. It is painful when an IRS auditor asks for the documentation of that mileage because it doesn’t exist. The IRS agent simply removes the deduction and assesses the tax. 30,000 miles can be a $15,000 deduction that just vanished and made your wallet significantly lighter. Think of how many people lose to the IRS what the EasyMile Log can help them get back!
Problem & Solution
No one wants to suffer through the audit, but it is even worse to try and keep a Daily Log of everywhere you go.
There has to be an Easier Way!
The Easy Mile Log is the Easier Way!
The Easy Mile Log takes advantage of modern technology – a built in GPS chip and memory module makes a self contained audit protector. It plugs into the cigarette lighter, tracks every trip and even adds addresses automatically. All you have to do is press “Work” or “Personal” – it does the rest. At the end of the year, print the summary report and have your totals for your taxes. No adding of gas receipts, tracking of manual books, or dealing with clunky apps. In an audit, print the detailed report – hand it to the IRS agent, and smile!
Your Deduction has been Saved!

VALUE (Valid Assessment of Learning in Undergraduate Education) is a campus-based assessment initiative sponsored by AAC&U as part of its LEAP initiative. VALUE provides needed tools to assess students' own authentic work, produced across their diverse learning pathways and institutions, to determine whether and how well they are progressing toward graduation-level achievement in learning outcomes that both employers and faculty consider essential.
VALUE builds on a philosophy of learning assessment that privileges multiple expert judgments and shared understanding of the quality of student work through the curriculum, cocurriculum, and beyond over reliance on standardized tests administered to samples of students disconnected from an intentional course of study.Nabil Costa, executive director of the Lebanese Baptist Society in Beirut, and Robert Sellers, professor at Logsdon School of Theology in Abilene, Texas, provided EthicsDaily.com with a copy of their papers in advance of their Thursday workshop titled "Christian and Muslim Siblings: Children of Abraham and Sarah and Hagar," held at the BWA's 20th Congress in Honolulu.
"The vilification of Christianity by Muslim extremists in order to justify militant jihad and the need to convert an 'immoral' West to Islam is alive and well," Costa wrote. "In the same way, political and media voices in the West have used long-standing prejudice against Islam in order to paint a vile picture of a religion that is part of an 'axis of evil' and bent on the destruction of a so-called 'free world.'"
He said that "perhaps the saddest thing today is the massive endorsement of this picture in many of our evangelical churches through a total demonization of Islam and Muslim culture. It is even emerging today that we have been seduced by imposters who, since 9/11, have posed as 'specialists' on Islam, not hesitating even to lie about their past and their credentials in order to preach a message of hate against Islam, and promote political bigotry with regards to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict."
Costa cited Ergun Caner, former president of Liberty Baptist Seminary, as an example of the "imposters."
"Based on the Bible's teaching against slander...we cannot accept that wrong information continues to be propagated about Islam and Muslims. Too many self-proclaimed and self-styled 'experts' on Islam have emerged in our circles since September 11, 2001. They have been received and their teaching embraced and idealized in our churches simply because their discourse has been feeding our phobias and they are confirming our suspicions. In other words, they are tickling our ears and captivating our hearts," said Costa.
Sellers also underscored the problem of "stereotyping and blatant misrepresentations of Muslims" that have fostered "a culture of Islamophobia."
"Baptists have clearly responded to Muslims in several ways, not all of them positive. Without a doubt, one way – reacting with fear and stereotyping – is unproductive and patently unkind. said.
For the third year in a row, BWA meetings have focused on the relationship between Baptists and Muslims. The first was at the 2008 BWA gathering in Prague, Czech Republic. The second was at the 2009 BWA meeting in Ede, Netherlands. Besides the Costa-Sellers' workshop, a similar workshop under the same title was scheduled on Friday with two different presenters.
Goodwill Baptists have taken a number of pro-active initiatives to advance the common good with Muslims, including the documentary "Different Books, Common Word: Baptists and Muslims."
Neither Costa nor Sellers was satisfied with critiquing the Baptist false witness against members of the Islamic faith.
Costa shared that Lebanese Baptists, through the Institute of Middle East Studies at the Arab Baptist Theological Seminary, hold an annual conference "to increase knowledge about Islam and Muslims in a balanced way among our constituency worldwide."
Through other initiatives, Lebanese Baptists seek "to transform misunderstandings and produce a paradigm shift among evangelicals and Baptists," said Costa.
Admitting that the Palestinian issue was a hot one and arguing that it need not be a political matter, he noted, "It is no secret today that one of the major sources of anger, frustration and even bitterness in the Muslim world is the Palestinian issue... It has erupted into major conflicts globally and can convincingly be shown to be at the root even of the tragedy of September 11, 2001... I believe it is also the key to the resolution of today's most troubling conflicts, from Afghanistan to Iraq."
The Lebanese Baptist leader pointed out: "The Palestinian issue need not divide us on political opinion if we focus primarily on the justice and human rights dimension of the problem. Whatever one's opinion of the political resolution needed in the Israel-Palestine question, there is no doubting that the situation of hundreds of thousands of Palestinians living in refugee camps of neighboring countries, such as Lebanon, Syria, Jordan and Egypt, is nothing less than a human tragedy and a deadly volcano waiting to erupt."
Costa challenged Baptists to engage in genuine humanitarian work in the Muslim world and not use the humanitarian platform to gain access to Islamic countries for mission work.
Arrogance, especially among evangelicals, causes conflict. What is needed is humility both by Christians and the U.S. government, he said, praising President Obama's Cairo speech as an example of humility that created "a sudden rise in hope" in the Arab streets.
"Humility cannot be faked long without being found out. But if it is genuine and follows up on the talk with action, then it has the power to transform the world," said Costa.
Sellers urged Baptists to develop a new future with their "spiritual siblings."
"[R]elying on Muslim insiders for our information is crucial for our learning" about Islam, said Sellers, who advocated for dialogue with Muslims instead of preaching to them.
Part of the first national American Muslim-Baptist dialogue in January 2009, Sellers called on Baptists to defend the religious liberty of Muslims.

I’m just learned what “SEO” stands for tonight. Learned how important it is to have a proper SEO settings as well.
I’m curious if there are any pointers that can make a website more likely to be searched by Google or another similar search engine?
I run a really small basic hosting company for friends and family. Is it idea to offer clients the ability to have SEO addons? I read that there are programs available online that can be purchased to help increase Search Engine Results through SEO .
Do you have any recommendations?
Thanks,
Bryce
Look up “Matt Cutts”
In the end simply writing good content is important also.
Understanding how google works helps but don’t over emphasize on the mechanics of SEO . If you put your title and alt attributes everywhere, specificy width/height of each image etc. etc. it’s going to help, but if the content is crap, Google won’t like you.
What you might be able to do as a hosting service is perhaps develop a tool that creates an xml map of a website and then submits that to google for easy indexing.
Most important is to stick to semantic code. Make sure you use CSS and separate your content from your markup.
Bryce, you can read MOZ, Bettergraph/blog , Neil patel blog and other here are so many resources available on internet. let me know if you are looking to outsource SEO work and want to focus on your main business. We provide Web Design, Development, Mobile Apps, SEO services.
I would highly recommend you to watch Matt Cutts videos on youtube. SEOMOZ is very good resource, you will find many tutorials and forums answer to help you grow more. Join two forums Digital Oceans and Warriors, I hope this will help you a bit.

Abstract
We explored the utility of odor-gated rheotaxis (OGR) with a biomimetic robot. OGR is a widely accepted biological plume-tracing strategy that uses mean flow and chemical detection for guidance. In experiments which contrasted the `classic' single-sensor formulation of the strategy against one which used two sensors and against another which combined the use of two sensors and memory of past stimulation patterns we quantified the relative advantages of each. The use of two, spatially separated, chemical sensors confers a significant advantage and still greater performance is obtained with rudimentary memory. The performance of the American lobster under the same turbulent dispersal regime leads us to conclude that significantly more effective plume tracing strategies remain to be discovered.

The Arid Lands Information Network, KenyaThe Arid Lands Network (Kenya) has two programmes which have been leveraging the use of ICTs to help communities adapt to climate change. First, they produced a platform providing support materials and information on climate change adaptations for local Kenyan communities. Complementing is a farmer-led grassroots programme on best practices and local management of adaptation knowledge. ( , Overview of ARLIN's project promoting environmental sustainability is available at)
E-Knowledge for Women in Southern Africa, ZimbabweEKOWISA (a member of APC Africa Women) has started to engage and raise awareness of e-waste issues in current legislative process notably the ICT Bill discussions among parliamentarians, councillors and civil society organisations. This is a relatively new area for Zimbabwe and the development of ICT4D could greatly benefit regional discussions that you are planning to have.
In discussions with Environmental Management Agency during the GISWatch research Ekowisa did on e-waste management, the manager showed willingness to engage with civil society organisations to do activities that will highlight e-waste issues at local level that could lead to policy changes. EKOWISA could bring gender equity and equality perspectives to enrich the process.
Protege QV, CameroonIn 2008, PROTEGE QV (Cameroon)with the support of Artists Project Earth () implemented a project not specifically related on water but on global climate change. The goal of the initiative was to sensitize rural and urban communities in
Cameroon on climate change. The specific objective was to elaborate a resource kit (RK) that can be used by community radios in Cameroon for broadcasting on climate change and actions to be taken at individual and community levels to prevent it.
Fantsuam Foundation, NigeriaAs a rural organization, Fantsuam Foundation (Nigeria) has raised local awareness on the impact of changing climatic patterns on agriculture, which is the primary occupation of its host communities. Late rains followed by excessive rainfalls has caused disruptions and affected household food security significantly. Fantsuam has also come to appreciate the role children can play in promoting environmentally friendly life styles at the grassroots level, and we have just established a Children's Parliament who have identified Environment as one of their key activities this year. Fantsuam will be working closely with this parliament. Fantsuam is also involved in several environmental initiatives: ranging from permaculture to renewable energy to waste management. (More information on Fantsuam's project that uses recycled computer solutions and sustainable energy sources - (doesn't contain many details on the above issues, though).)
Fantsuam Foundation is currently developing an Eco-Village as a model for hands-on training in permacultural practices in which ICTs are used to enhance water storage and recycling
Waste disposal is also closely linked to Water conservation in the rural communities of Nigeria. Streams are often used as places to dump domestic garbage, so regeneration of these water sources often requires community engagement and provision of more efficient and accessible waste disposal systems.
The recent flooding in several farming communities in Nigeria, due to heavy rains and weakened structures of the traditional mud houses provides an opportunity to link deforestation, garbage disposal and climate change using powerful images.
ArabDev, EgyptArabDev (Egypt) has developed the Arabic version of the environmental information kit for UNDP Global Environment Facility’s (GEF) Small Grants Programme (SGP) in Egypt. The initiative focused on presenting complex technical environmental information for climate change, international waters, land degradation, and biodiversity in a simplified version accessible to the general public. This was the first information kit of its kind in the Arab region.
ArabDev was also a partner with the Massachusetts Institute of Technology’s (MIT) Global System of Sustainable Development (GSSD). ArabDev has conducted various research projects in Egypt and North Africa concerning environment, information technology and gender. It has high interest and commitment to a longer term programmatic approach, especially as the issue of climate change is of utmost importance for Egypt!
Arabdev and APC are currently exploring the possibility of a joint partnership re. a MENA governance programme initiative, that could be scaled to other areas later on. The objectives, in a nutshell, are to promote communication and media sharing in the region among media professionals, civil society and youth based on proper media legal issues. The programme will offer legal and media training to promote open, quality discourses based on cross cutting sectors like water, climate change, gender, and other issues of interest. It will offer media professionals, civil groups and private citizens the tools to responsibly advocate, initiate and participate in vital issues.

Digital Empowerment Foundation, IndiaDEF has developed Drinking Water Information Management System called NeerJaal:. DEF is working with Barefoot College in Rajasthan. They have got grant from Department of Science and Technology, Gov of India Fund over, the DST is considering extending the project and giving next phase of funding
They are now also approaching Ministry of Rural Development for support.
The way the project works is that: they target the village level women and men in the following:
- identify sources of drinking
- collect water samples
- train them them how to do test the water using indigenously developed water testing tools to have qualitative and quantitative data
- train them in using the neerjaal system that has been developed and upload the community driven and community developed data
Voice, BangladeshVoice produced a video documentary on climate change and its impact jointly with a Belgium group. It has previously created films on food supply, agriculture and the empowerment of rural women. () One of the ideas to share, to build up and strengthen communities and movements, CSOs engaged in water/climate change movements through ICTs including using new forms of media. For example, using facebook communities, students engaged in using ICTs,.
Research part cane be: scoping ICTs and engagement of youth in water/climate change issues.
BFES, BangladeshBangladesh Friendship Education Society works as part of an action research initiative on Disaster and Climate Change issues in addressing Communication for Change.
Bytesforall, BangladeshBytesforall Bangladesh has done an extensive research on all existing policies related to climate change, water and environment impact and identified issues that are related to use of ICTs. One research gap that Bytesforall Bangladesh has identified is around eWaste issues as there is no relevant policy on this particular topic. Therefore it is working to conduct another in-depth research on eWaste policy and context in Bangladesh. It is also planning to organize an online and face to face consultation around ICTs, climate change and environment issues. Currently, Bytesforall Bangladesh is hosting an online consultation with 'Access to Information' (A2I) program (supported by UNDP Bangladesh and hosted at Prime Minister's Office) who prepared a strategy document that includes many topic of development including ICTs role to climate change and environment. Its co-founder, Partha Sarker worked with Sustainable Development Networking Program (SDNP Bangladesh) to assess the resource needs of different organizations that work on environment issues and provided recommendations in creating an information network.
Bytesforall, PakistanBytesforall Pakistan's coordinator Shahzad Ahmad worked with Stockholm Environment Institute, York University, UK and OXFAM GB to develop a media guide on communicating climate change. The guide was used for a national level media workshop in Pakistan held on 12-14 May 2009. We are getting Liz Barclay from BBC 4 and Dr. Gary Haq from York as resource persons. After the workshop, the guide was made available to all media outfits and advocacy organizations. This was a joint effort of SEI, OXFAM and IUCN.
EngageMedia/APC.AU, AustraliaEngageMedia has recently released a compile of short videos responding to climate issues from Asia Pacific. The entire project used open licensed content including captioning / subtitling now available as a bittorent compile. More recently, we developed a distribution workshop to assist climate campaigners improve their use of video online when working on climate issues.
Although not directly related to water, that rising water levels IS an issue raised by groups and documented in the compile, that we use various "new media" / ICTs to stimulate public discussion and provide means for deeper public engagement in these issues, is a valid component within an overall strategy.
FYI, a short video of EngageMedia's T4RA Climate Workshop in SEL 49, Jakarta. Participants included representatives from Javin, Greenpeace, Jatam, Air Putih, ProFauna and Forum Lenteng.
APC.au directors have been involved in climate research since the late 1980's, having established the first database on climate change research in Australia (Greenhouse Action Australia). We have also assisted in the establishment of a national network of local government environment officers (CouncilNet) and a regional-wide network of environment groups and associations in Asia dealing with climate change and forestry issues (Pactok). All three projects, and many more besides, laid the foundation for networks and activities that are still active today.
Presently, apc.au is producing of a series of micro documentaries depicting the impacts on the forest communities of Sarawak, Malaysia, due to climate change and the government's proposed hydro-electric dam construction ( )
Research projects apc.au has recently performed include
- Mapping of arts activity across the state of Victoria and a proposal for a multimedia documentation of models of arts practice that has an online capacity to connect to Disability Online ()
- Advice on tools, design and implementation of arts and disabilities events and services database throughout Victoria ()
- Melbourne Outside the Square Web 2.0 / social networking advisory ( )
- Background research and onsite investigations for the African component of the Home Lands project ( )
APC.au is firmly committed to the use of ICTS to develop awareness of and facilitate action towards addressing climate and environmental issues. Our objectives include working to create a sustainable environment for society, corporations and individuals17.

Alternatives, CanadaAlternatives (Canada) has identified environmental sustainability as a strategic priority in its present five-year action plan. Current projects include the rooftop garden project and an online school of social ecology with partners in Brazil, Venezuela and Bolivia. The rooftop garden project is an innovative partnership between Alternatives and Montreal-based community organisations to empower urban residents to produce their own food, green their neighborhoods and build healthy communities. Alternatives is currently implementing an international version of this project in Cuba. () During the WSF in Belem, Alternatives lunched a new Environmental Web platform called ECOmunidade () aiming at promoting new practices of social ecology contributing at developing sustainable societies in various sectors including social economy, eco-tourism, alternatives energies, urban agriculture, etc. Members of the project/network are Social org, unions, universities, etc.. based in Cuba, Bolivia, Peru, Venezuela and Argentina.
La Neta, MexicoLa Neta (Mexico) has had some experiences oriented to put ICT skills for environmental sustainability. Maybe the most important is the project "Emisiones: espacio virtual", that started In 1996 and was developed during 4 years. This project focused on using new information technologies to strengthen communication and information among organizations working on environmental issues such as pollution from toxic substances, environmental legislation and the right to information. One of the objectives was to publicize and promote actions in relation to the Pollutant Release and Transfer Registry (PRTR) that the National Institute of Ecology (Instituto Nacional de Ecología—INE) had been in the process of establishing. The work was carried out basically through an Internet site and the emissions-l electronic mailing list, in addition to direct communication, in person or through the project’s electronic mail address with organizations and individuals interested in the subject. Emissions: espacio virtual was located—as its name indicates—in virtual space. It maintained contact with organizations around the country, and from its virtual "center" it distributed and administered its information services.
The environmental situation in Mexico is still very serious. While there is legislation that regulates and establishes norms for certain environmental aspects in the country, this has been insufficient. The emissions project was initiated because of the need in Mexico for a registry of industrial pollution and management of dangerous substances—which is the objective of the PRTR. With such a registry, we could be informed of toxic emissions in the air, water and soil that affect communities. Despite the compiling of data for this registry began, the communities didn´t have access to this information. That was a very important reason to unite efforts among environmental and citizen groups and organizations to continue to work for the right to environmental information, something not frequently demanded in Mexico. We were committed to this task and we were "virtually" and concretely united.
Thus, other purpose of the "Emisiones: Espacio Virtual" project was to communicate and take actions in response to the problem of dangerous substances in Mexico. In order to fulfill this purpose, we were in constant communication with organizations and individuals involved in this type of work in order to join efforts in promoting and exercising the right to environmental information, and to take actions designed to have an impact on environmental policies in terms of the use of cleaner technologies in industrial processes and to work for environmental justice. We developed also relationships with Canada and the United States. At the end of the project, it had managed to collect important information on the experiences of organizations fighting against the use of toxic substances and clandestine storage areas and trash dumps. We had lists of toxic substances; an alternative list proposed by NGOs; information on health and toxicology, and on pesticides; news items and actions taken; and information on environmental legislation, on the right to information, and on cross-border transporting of toxic substances. Other organizations participate on an ongoing basis by sending information and coordinating joint efforts in organizing actions in favor of a healthy environment. Representatives of the project attended international environmental meetings and developed relationships with groups in the United States and Canada, especially with environmental organizations and those working with the right to information.
During two years LaNeta developed the portal "LaNeta en ambiente" (some like LaNeta in environmental issues). It was an online collection of information regarding the environmental Mexican movement from NGOs. It was a response in terms that much of the environmental information on the internet is fragmented. Unfortunately its financial support was the principal reason for not to continue. Both projects Emisiones: espacio virtual and Laneta en ambiente were developed under the direction of Olinca Marino

Nodo Tau, ArgentinaNodo Tau (Argentina) runs several telecenters running refurbished computers, as well as operation of 'portable' telecentre – Dealing with these issues: e-waste, low power consumption computers, alternative power sources.
We continue with the the refurbished telecentre project.
Last year we designed a basic computer training for CSOs in two districts of the city. The training program is called Rodantic, a name which comes from the fact that we have assembled a portable classroom (three cases) with a refurbished notebook (Pentium II) in a LTSP scheme (Linux Terminal Server Project). We have done two trainings last year and we organize another one this year. - Since June 2008, Nodo TAU designed and conducted a workshop on refurbishing and reconditioning of Computers in Santa Monica Special School (for school age children with disabilities) in the city of San Lorenzo, 27 km far from Rosario. See.
In 2010, Nodo Tau will be making the first donations to some schools.
- During the year 2009, we prepared together with the Secretariat for Solidarity Economy of the Municipality of Rosario and the INTI (National Institute of Industrial Technology) a project of a WEEE recycling plant (Waste Electrical and Electronic devices) which will be managed by a cooperative.
Nodo Tau is responsible for staff training and it will provide the three persons required for technical supervision of the plant (Management Unit of the plant). The project is approved by the Ministry of Labour and Social Security. Some minor items need to be finalized and it will start running in the month of March or no later than April.
CEPES, PeruIn Huaral, at 100 km distance of Lima, CEPES (Peru) is improving the use of ICT for the water management, better ways to use water on farming, in a context of climate change and promoting the environmental sustainability on coast farmers. The irrigation management system of Huaral, now has a GIS. Coast farmers in Peru work under special conditions. One of them is the water shortage, that happens almost the entire year. That is why the monitoring of climate and environment turns to be very important to the coast farmers of Huaral, and the reason of CEPES's work. CEPES also runs a radio program on climate change-related issues that is broadcast by Radio Sembra Huaral. Climate change turns to be very important to coast farmers, specially the farmers with small crop areas, because they are more prone to be affected with temperature changes, humidity changes (plagues, crop diseases, etc.). Peru has been identified (as part of the andean reagion) as a country highly exposed to the negative impact of climate change ( )
Cepes is also producing material in podcasting and video to be distributed to rural people.
CONDESAN, PeruCONDESAN, Andean region (Venezuela, Colombia, Ecuador, Peru, Bolivia, Argentina and Chile). Consortium for the Sustainable Development of the Andean Ecoregion (CONDESAN) is not a member of APC but a long-standing partner.
CONDESAN has many years of experience working on water management issues. They have several initiatives in the Andean region looking at the issue of climate change and water, and some of them are closely linked with the intensive use of ICT. They have experience with remote sensors and hydrological monitoring in small catchment areas. They coordinate a GLORIA network (Global Observation Research Initiative in Alpine Environment () initiative in the Andes () and they have also been engaged in the development of policy support systems like AguaAndes (?). For the last 5 years CONDESAN has been leading the Challenge Program on Water and Food in the Andes which second phase has just started. CONDESAN is leading a research in Peru on "Building Community Resilience to the Social Dimensions of Climate Change and Improving the Equity of Adaptation through the Action Coalition Framework" with the support of the World Bank.

BlueLink, BulgariaBlueLink is an electronic information network, founded by environmental non-governmental organisations (NGOs) and active citizens who believe that associated NGOs make a far greater and longer-lasting impact on environmental decision making when working in a coordinated effort. Over the years BlueLink has been serving as a forum for free information exchange and an independent communication platform for exchange of ideas and experiences among organisations and citizens from Bulgaria and other parts of the world. At present BlueLink is an up-to-date, virtual network offering a wide range of Internet-based services in order to stimulate the strategic use of information and communication technologies (ICTs) by the civil sector and to amplify civic activism for progressive social change towards a socially and environmentally responsible policy. BlueLink led much of APC's embryonic work in environmental sustainability and ICTs, and its formidable experience in the field of ICTs and environmental sustainability has largely informed APC's plans for GreeningIT.
One World Platform for South Eastern Europe - OWPSEEOne World Platform for South Eastern Europe - OWPSEE (Bosnia-Herzegovina) has also prioritised environmental sustainability in its current action plan. It is planning to build a knowledge base on ICTs and environmental sustainability by collecting material from relevant regional and global information sources and translating into local working languages such as Bosnian and Serbian. It is also pursuing a joint activity with local women's organisations to address this issue from a gender perspective. ()
Computer Aid International, United Kingdom and KenyaThe production of a single personal computer (PC) consumes two and a half tonnes of materials and expends ten times its weight in fossil fuels. In the UK, Computer Aid International has successfully doubled the effective working life of 115,000 PCs through re-use. They have provided professionally refurbished PCs to educational and development organisations, including environment and climate change projects, in more than 100 developing countries. According to research from the UN University in Tokyo, extending PC life through re-use is twenty times more environmentally efficient than recycling a PC's component parts. By refurbishing 115,000 PCs, Computer Aid has made possible more than half a billion extra user hours.
Computer Aid is also helping metereological offices in Kenya, Zimbabwe, and Uganda decentralise the analysis of climate information by providing hardware and software to rural weather stations, enabling them to conduct in-house analysis and issue forecasts and advice to local farmers and fisher-people. By decentralising analysis capacity, the accuracy of local climate data is improved and the weather stations are able to assume an enhanced social function by assisting in community preparedness against droughts, storms, and other adverse climatic events. (This work is being done in partnership with national meteorological offices in Africa as well as with the UK Metereological Office and Reading University. Please see for more information.)Q. What’s the county’s most valuable crop?
A. Strawberries. They brought growers $609 million in gross revenues in 2013.
Q. What are the other top crops?
A: In terms of gross revenues, the other top 10 crops are:
• Avocados: $210 million
• Raspberries: $196 million
• Nursery Stock: $191 million
• Lemons: $189 million
• Celery: $181 million
• Tomatoes: $76 million
• Peppers: $52 million
• Cut flowers: $43 million
• Cilantro: $29 million
Q. What’s the total value of crops grown in Ventura County?
A. For 2013, the estimated gross value was $2.1 billion.
Q. How does that compare to other counties?
A. Ventura County ranked No. 9 among California counties in total crop value in 2012, according to the California Department of Food and Agriculture. The most recent national data put Ventura County at No. 10 among all counties in the United States.
Q. Which crop covers the most land?
A. Avocados, which are grown on about 20,000 acres. Lemons are next, at about 15,000 acres, followed by strawberries, 14,00 acres, and celery, 11,000 acres. Together, those four crops account for more than half the total harvested acreage in the county.
Q. How many farms are there in Ventura County?
A. According to the most recent Census of Agriculture, conducted every five years by the National Agricultural Statistics Service, Ventura County had 2,150 farms in 2012. The agency defines a farm as an operation that produces at least $1,000 worth of products in a year.
Q. Is that more or fewer than in the past?
A. Overall, fewer. There were 2,760 farms in the county in 1998. The number did increase between 2002 and 2007, but it dropped again between 2007 and 2012.
Q. Are Ventura County farms bigger or smaller than those elsewhere?
A. Smaller. The average farm size in Ventura County is 131 acres. The statewide average is 328 acres, and the nationwide average is 434 acres. In Ventura County, the median farm size — meaning half of all farms are bigger, and half are smaller — is 12 acres.
Q. How much farmland is there in Ventura County?
A. There are various ways of calculating that. According to the California Department of Conservation’s Farmland Mapping Program, Ventura County in 2010 contained 118,800 acres of “important farmland” and 197,866 acres of grazing land, for a total of 316,666 acres of agricultural land. According to the Ventura County Agricultural Commissioner’s Office, 109,150 acres of crops were harvested in the county in 2013.
Q. How does the area in agriculture compare to the county’s total land area?
A. The county’s total land area is 1.2 million acres. Using the Department of Conservation data, 26 percent of the county is agricultural land. (About half the county’s land area consists of Los Padres National Forest, Santa Monica Mountains National Recreation Area and other protected public lands.)
Q. How does the area in farms compare to the area in cities?
A. According to the state, Ventura County has 105,461 acres of urban and built-up land. So, for every acre of shopping mall, city street and housing tract, there’s approximately an acre of celery, strawberries, lemons, peppers, flowers and other crops.
Q. Is farmland being lost to development?
A. Yes. Even though voters have approved laws intended to protect farmland and open space from development, the county has lost nearly 9,000 acres of farmland to development since 1992.
Q. How important is agriculture to the Ventura County economy?
A. In addition to generating direct on-farm employment and revenue, agricultural production supports a wide range of other businesses, including packinghouses, equipment dealers, chemical applicators, pest-control firms, labor contractors, fertilizer and other supply dealers, trucking firms, fuel distributors, and repair and manufacturing facilities. Altogether, farming and farm-dependent businesses provide an estimated 43.
Q. How many field workers are employed on Ventura County farms?
A. It’s difficult to get a reliable count, but there are believed to be about 20,000 Ventura County farm workers. The number ranges seasonally from a low of 15,000 to a high of 25,000 during the peak spring and summer harvest of strawberries, lemons and avocados.
Q. Where are they from?
A. If they are like the rest of California’s farm worker population, an estimated 95 percent were born outside the United States, and 91 percent were born in Mexico.
Q. What percentage are undocumented immigrants?
A. Precise local figures are not available, but statewide surveys suggest at least 57 percent of California’s field workers are in the country illegally.
Q. Where do local growers get their water?
A. It depends on where they are. Most growers in the county rely on groundwater, particularly on the Oxnard Plain. Others purchase it from agencies that deliver water imported from Northern California by the State Water Project, or from agencies that collect surface water in local reservoirs. Local groundwater and surface water are by far the most important sources for local farmers.
Q. Are Ventura County growers switching to organic production?
A. Some have. There are 85 registered organic growers in the county, and they account for 6,394 acres — about 6 percent of the farmland in cultivation.
Q. Do growers use a lot of pesticides?
A. It depends on how you define it. According to figures compiled by the California Department of Pesticide Regulation, 5.8 million pounds of insecticides, herbicides and fungicides were applied in Ventura County in 2009, the most recent year for which data are available.
Q. What’s the most commonly used pesticide?
A. The most abundantly applied pesticide by weight in 2012 was chloropicrin, 2.8 million pounds. It’s a soil fumigant used to prepare fields for planting strawberries, tomatoes, raspberries, peppers and other crops. Second was mineral and petroleum oil, 1.2 million pounds. Oil is mainly used in orchards to control scale, aphids and mites, and it is considered benign as pesticides go, a mildly toxic substance approved in certain formulations for use on organic crops. It works by coating and suffocating pests rather than by poisoning them.
Q. Why do growers use fumigants?
A. The chemicals are injected into the soil before planting to kill weeds, insects, nematodes and other pests. Research and practical experience have demonstrated dramatically reduced crop yields when fumigants are not used. Because farmland costs so much to buy, rent or lease in Ventura County, growers must maximize production and revenues in order to stay in business.
Q. How does farm pesticide use compare to household use?
A. Farmers are not alone in using chemicals to kill unwanted organisms. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency estimates that home and garden use accounts for about 20 percent of American pesticide consumption. If that average holds in Ventura County, then local residents use nearly 2 million pounds of toxic chemicals in their homes and yards every year.
Q. How many people do Ventura County growers feed?
A. Although local farms and ranches produce more than 100 types of fruit, nut, vegetable and grain crops, the county’s climate makes it particularly suited to such specialty crops as citrus, berries and fresh vegetables. Some of these are produced in astonishing abundance. Ventura County produces enough strawberries each year, for example, to satisfy the annual consumption of 78 million Americans. In an average year, it would take 87 million Americans to consume the county’s lemon crop, 135 million to consume its celery production, and 45 million to eat all its avocados.
Last updated: 10/14/14A new study performed by ABI research has ripped another hole in the already-weak rampant claims of unstoppable movie piracy and the struggling film business. According to the study, which polled 1,725 North American online consumers 18+, only 5% watched legal digital movie downloads, and even less watch illegal downloads, making it "the least watched genre of online video on the Internet." The majority of respondents say they watch short-form content like news, sports and viral media. Why are they ignoring digitally-acquired films and illegal downloads? Because "they were satisfied with their current providers and the rental market."
Obviously this is more of the same. But maybe, just maybe, if we get enough of these studies together that prove most of us are not movie swashbucklers, they'll create an invisible shield from the incessant claims.

OF THE INVENTIONThe present invention relates generally to methods for separating whole blood into blood components and collecting a desired blood component, and specifically to methods of treating diseases with a photopheresis treatment.BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTIONSeveral treatments for disease require the removal of blood from a patient, processing the one or more components of the blood, and return of the processed components for a therapeutic effect. Those extracorporeal treatments require systems forsafely orother diseases affecting white blood cells. In such methods, the patient's blood is irradiated with ultraviolet light in the presence of a chemical or an antibody. Ultraviolet light affects the bonding between the lymphocytes and the chemical orantibodyorealphotopheresis may be utilized to treat numerous diseases including Graft-versus-Host disease, Rheumatoid Arthritis, Progressive Systematic Sclerosis, Juvenile Onset Diabetes, Inflammatory Bowel Disease and other diseases that are thought to be T-cell orwhite blood cell mediated, including cancer. Apheresis systems and methods have also been proposed and used which involve separation of blood into various components.During one of thes
United States Patent: 7850634 ( 1 of 1 ) United States Patent 7,850,634 Briggs December 14, 2010 Method for collecting a desired blood component and performing a photopheresis treatment Abstract is drawn from a source and pumped into a separator, the undesired blood components are removed from the separator at rates so as to build up the desired blood component in the separator. The desired blood component is only removed after a predetermined amount of the desired blood component has built up in the separator. It is preferred that the desired blood component be buffy coat and that the method be used to perform photopheresis treatments. In another aspect, the invention is a method of performing a full photopheresis treatment to treat diseases in a reduced time, preferably less than about 70 minutes, and more preferably less than about 45 minutes.

Description TECHNICAL FIELD OF THE INVENTION The present invention relates generally to methods for separating whole blood into blood components and collecting a desired blood component, and specifically to methods of treating diseases with a photopheresis treatment. BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION Several treatments for disease require the removal of blood from a patient, processing the one or more components of the blood, and return of the processed components for a therapeutic effect. Those extracorporeal treatments require systems for safely or other diseases affecting white blood cells. In such methods, the patient's blood is irradiated with ultraviolet light in the presence of a chemical or an antibody. Ultraviolet light affects the bonding between the lymphocytes and the chemical or antibodyoreal photopheresis may be utilized to treat numerous diseases including Graft-versus-Host disease, Rheumatoid Arthritis, Progressive Systematic Sclerosis, Juvenile Onset Diabetes, Inflammatory Bowel Disease and other diseases that are thought to be T-cell or white blood cell mediated, including cancer. Apheresis systems and methods have also been proposed and used which involve separation of blood into various components. During one of these medical treatments, a centrifuge bowl, such as, for example, a Latham bowl, as shown in U.S. Pat. No. 4,303,193, expressly incorporated by reference in its entirety herein, is operated to separate whole blood into red blood cells ("RBCs"), plasma, and buffy coat. The Latham bowl is a blood component separator that has been used for some time in the medical apheresis market as well as in innovative medical therapies such as extracorporeal photopheresis (ECP). PCT Applications WO 97/36581 and WO 97/36634, and U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,321,919; 4,398,906; 4,428,744; and 4,464,166 provide descriptions of extracorporeal photopheresis, and are hereby expressly incorporated by reference in their entirety. Latham bowl efficiency is often measured by the white blood cell ("WBC") "yield," which is typically about 50%. Yield is defined as the percentage of cells collected versus the number processed. When compared to other types of whole blood separators, this high yield enables the Latham bowl separator to collect much larger volumes of WBCs while processing much less whole blood from the donor patient. However, a major drawback to the Latham bowl separator is that the separation process must be repeatedly stopped to remove the packed RBCs and plasma once they fill the inside of the bowl, creating a "batch-type" treatment process. Although the Latham bowl separator has a high volume yield, the constant filling and emptying of this bowl wastes time; thus, the process is considered less efficient with respect to time. Prior photopheresis and apheresis systems and methods usually require batch processes and therefore take several hours to treat a patient or to obtain a sufficient supply of separated blood fragments. Furthermore, the systems are very complex to manufacture. It is a constant objective to reduce the time it takes to perform a complete photopheresis treatment session. Another objective is to reduce the amount of blood that must be drawn form a patient and processed in closed-loop processes per photopheresis treatment session. Yet another objective to increase the amount of white blood cell yield or obtain a cleaner cut of buffy coat per volume of whole blood processed. DISCLOSURE OF THE INVENTION An object of the present invention is to provide an improved method for separating a fluid, such as blood or other biological fluid, into its components. An additional object is to increase the efficiency of current fluid separation processes by decreasing the time necessary to separate out a desired amount of a fluid component from the fluid. Yet other objects of the present invention are to treat a patient more efficiently, to improve a photopheresis process, or to improve a platelet removal process. An additional object of the present invention is to separate and remove targeted cells by their specific gravity. Another object of the present invention is to eliminate the need to perform fluid separation processes in "batch" form. A still further object of the present invention is to increase the percent yield of a desired fluid component from a fluid being separated. The present invention solves the inadequacies of the prior art by being able to continuously separate fluid components without interrupting the process to empty a centrifuge bowl and remove a separated component. Thus, the present invention eliminates batch processing and other Latham bowl batch-type techniques. These objects and others are met by the present invention which is directed at improving the methods for separating whole blood into its components and collecting a desired blood component. Depending on the intended treatment, the desired blood component may be buffy coat, red blood cells, plasma, or any component thereof. The present invention is also directed at improving existing methods of treating diseases using photopheresis therapies. Specifically, the present invention provides a continuous process for whole blood separation of sufficient fragment for photopheresis treatment so as to greatly reduce the photopheresis treatment time for a patient. When it is desired to collect buffy coat from whole blood, the invention in one aspect is a method red blood cells from the separator while continuing to pump the mixture of whole blood and anticoagulant fluid into the separator, the plasma and red blood cells being withdrawn at rates so as to build up buffy coat in the separator, the plasma being withdrawn via the first outlet and the red blood cells being withdrawn via the second outlet; and upon a predetermined amount of buffy coat building up in the separator, collecting the buffy coat from the separator. By withdrawing the red blood cells and the plasma at rates so that the buffy coat is allowed to build up within the separator, which is preferably a centrifuge bowl, the buffy coat is subjected to the centrifugal force of the separator for a prolonged period of time. Increasing the time which the buffy coat is subjected to centrifugal force yields a cleaner fraction of buffy coat and an increased white blood cell yield. Additionally, this prolonged exposure can be used to further separate the buffy coat into its constituent parts, including platelets and various kinds of leukocytes. When pumping the mixture of whole blood and anticoagulant fluid into the separator, it is preferred that the mixture pass through, and be routed by, a cassette for controlling fluid flow. It is further preferable that the buffy coat be collected from the separator by discontinuing the withdrawal of red blood cells from the second outlet, thereby causing the red blood cells to push the buffy coat out of the separator via the first outlet as whole blood continues to enter the separator. The withdrawn buffy coat can be collected in a treatment bag that is fluidly connected to the separator via an outlet line. In this embodiment, the collection of buffy coat is preferably discontinued when red blood cells are detected in the outlet line. This will minimize red blood cells from being mixed with the desired buffy coat. In performing this method, it is also preferable that only the plasma be withdrawn from the separator until a predetermined amount of red blood cells are detected in the separator. Then, upon the predetermined amount of red blood cells being detected in the separator, the red blood cells will be drawn from the separator at a rate so as to maintain the amount of red blood cells present in the separator at approximately the predetermined amount. The predetermined amount of red blood cells can be detected using a hematocrit sensor that can detect a red cell line within the centrifuge bowl itself. When the method is being used in a closed loop process where the source of the whole blood is a patient, it is important to return fluids back to the patient during processing. In order to achieve this, it is preferable that the withdrawn plasma be collected in a plasma storage bag, mixed with a priming fluid, and returned to the patient when a selected amount of plasma is collected in the plasma storage bag. It is further preferable to mix the withdrawn red blood cells with the plasma and priming fluid mixture from the plasma collection bag and returning the red blood cell-plasma-priming fluid mixture to the patient at a rate approximately equal to the inlet rate. This method can be used in connection with photopheresis treatment. In a photopheresis treatment, the method will further comprise injecting a photoactivation chemical into the collected buffy coat, and irradiating the collected buffy coat within an irradiation chamber until a predetermined amount of energy has been transferred to the collected buffy coat. In order to ensure that a proper amount of energy is transferred to the buffy coat, for example to induce apoptosis, it is preferable to recirculate the collected buffy coat between a treatment bag and the irradiation chamber. Before the irradiated buffy coat is returned to the patient undergoing the photopheresis therapy, the irradiated buffy coat should pass through a filter. Using this method, enough buffy coat can be collected and irradiated to perform a full photopheresis treatment in less than about 70 minutes. More preferably, the overall treatment time is less than about 45 minutes. It may also be desired to collect the red blood cells from the separator for other types of treatments. Because the red blood cells can be subjected to prolonged centrifugal force, the current method provides a very packed amount of red cells. These red blood cells can be withdrawn and collected for further use, such as in apheresis therapy. In yet another aspect, the invention is a method of performing a photopheresis treatment for ameliorating diseases. This method comprises: drawing whole blood from a source; adding an anticoagulant fluid to the whole blood in a predetermined ratio to form a mixture of the whole blood and the anticoagulant fluid; separating the mixture of whole blood and anticoagulant into a plurality of blood components according to density; mixing a photoactivation chemical with at least one the blood components to form a mixture of the photoactivation chemical and the at least one blood component; irradiating the combination of the at least one blood component and photoactivation chemical; and returning the irradiated combination to a patient; wherein the entire photopheresis treatment is completed in less about than 70 minutes. More preferably, the entire photopheresis treatment is completed in less about than 45 minutes. This is a vast improvement over previous photopheresis treatments which usually required a treatment time of two hours or more. In this aspect of the invention, the at least one blood component can be buffy coat, a leukocyte, or platelets. Buffy coat is preferred. In performing the photopheresis treatment, the mixture of whole blood and anticoagulant fluid is preferably pumped into a separator having an inlet, a first outlet, and a second outlet. Because buffy coat is the desired blood component in a photopheresis therapy session, plasma and red blood cells are withdrawn from the separator while continuing to pump the mixture of whole blood and anticoagulant fluid into the separator. The plasma and red blood cells are preferably withdrawn at rates so as to build up buffy coat in the separator, allowing the buffy coat to be exposed to prolonged centrifugal forces. The plasma is withdrawn via the first outlet and the red blood cells being withdrawn via the second outlet. Buffy coat is preferably collected from the separator for irradiation only after a predetermined amount of buffy coat builds up therein. The separated buffy coat is preferably collected from the separator through an outlet line that is fluidly connected to a treatment bag. The buffy coat can be collected from the separator by discontinuing the withdrawal of red blood cells from the second outlet while continuing to pump in whole blood. This causes the red blood cells to push the buffy coat out of the separator via the first outlet. Buffy coat collection is preferably stopped when red blood cells are detected in the outlet line by a hematocrit sensor. The collected buffy coat is preferably irradiated within an irradiation chamber until a predetermined amount of energy has been transferred to the collected buffy coat. The predetermined amount of energy is preferably sufficient to induce apoptosis. This photopheresis treatment is preferably performed in a closed-loop system where the patient is also the source. Finally, instead of separating only buffy coat, the buffy cells can be further separated if desired into their components such as platelets and leukocytes. Finally, an effective method of collecting red blood cells is achieved by another aspect of the invention which is a method of collecting a desired blood component buffy coat from the separator while continuing to pump the mixture of whole blood and anticoagulant fluid into the separator, the plasma and buffy coat being withdrawn at rates so as to build up red blood cells in the separator, the plasma and buffy coat being withdrawn via the first outlet; and upon a predetermined amount of red blood cells building up in the separator, collecting the red blood cells from the separator via the second outlet. This method allows the red blood cells to build up in the separator and be subjected to a maximum amount of prolonged centrifugal force BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS The invention is described in detail with respect to the accompanying drawings, which illustrate an embodiment of the inventive apparatus, assemblies, systems, and methods.

Infra-Red Communication III. Photopheresis Treatment Process The above-outline is included to facilitate understanding of the features of the present invention. The outline is not limiting of the present invention and is not intended to categorize or limit any aspect of the invention. The inventions are described and illustrated in sufficient detail that those skilled in this art can readily make and use them. However, various alternatives, modifications, and improvements should become readily apparent without departing from the spirit and scope of the invention. Specifically, while the invention is described in the context of a disposable kit and permanent blood drive system for use in photopheresis therapy, certain aspects of the invention are not so limited and are applicable to kits and systems used for rendering other therapies, such as apheresis or any other extracorporeal blood treatment therapy. I. Disposable Photopheresis Kit FIG. 1 illustrates disposable photopheresis kit 1000 embodying features of the present invention. It is necessary that a new disposable sterile kit be used for each therapy session. In order to facilitate the circulation of fluids through photopheresis kit 1000, and to treat blood fluids circulating therethrough, photopheresis kit 1000 is installed in permanent tower system 2000 (FIG. 17). The installation of photopheresis kit 1000 into tower system 2000 is described in detail below. Photopheresis kit 1000 comprises cassette 1100, centrifuge bowl 10, irradiation chamber 700, hematocrit sensor 1125, removable data card 1195, treatment bag 50, and plasma collection bag 51. Photopheresis kit 1000 further comprises saline connector spike 1190 and anticoagulant connector spike 1191 for respectively connecting saline and anticoagulant fluid bags (not shown). Photopheresis kit 1000 has all the necessary tubing and connectors to fluidly connect all devices and to route the circulation of fluids during a photopheresis treatment session. All tubing is sterile medical grade flexible tubing. Triport connectors 1192 are provided at various positions for the introduction of fluids into the tubing if necessary. Needle adapters 1193 and 1194 are provided for respectively connecting photopheresis kit 1000 to needles for drawing whole blood from a patient and returning blood fluids to the patient. Alternatively, photopheresis kit 1000 can be adapted to use a single needle to both draw whole blood from the patient and return blood fluids to the patient. However, a two needle kit is preferred because of the ability to simultaneously draw whole blood and return blood fluids to the patient. When a patient is hooked up to photopheresis kit 1000, a closed loop system is formed. Cassette 1100 acts both as a tube organizer and a fluid flow router. Irradiation chamber 700 is used to expose blood fluids to UV light. Centrifuge bowl 10 separates whole blood into its different components according to density. Treatment bag 50 is a 1000 mL three port bag. Straight bond port 52 is used to inject a photoactivatable or photosensitive compound into treatment bag 50. Plasma collection bag 51 is 1000 mL two port bag. Both treatment bag 50 and plasma collection bag 51 have a hinged cap spike tube 53 which can be used for drainage if necessary. Photopheresis kit 1000 further comprises hydrophobic filters 1555 and 1556 which are adapted to connect to pressure transducers 1550 and 1551 to filter 1500 via vent tubes 1552 and 1553 for monitoring and controlling the pressures within tubes connecting the patient (FIG. 10). Monitoring the pressure helps ensure that the kit is operating within safe pressure limits. The individual devices of photopheresis kit 1000, and their functioning, are discussed below in detail. A. Cassette for Controlling Fluid Flow FIG. 2 shows a top perspective view of a disposable cassette 1100 for valving, pumping, and controlling the movement of blood fluids during a photopheresis treatment session. Cassette 1100 has housing 1101 that forms an internal space that acts as a casing for its various internal components and tubular circuitry. Housing 1101 is preferably made of hard plastic, but can be made of any suitably rigid material. Housing 1101 has side wall 1104 and top surface 1105. Side wall 1104 of housing 1101 has tabs 1102 and 1103 extending therefrom. During a photopheresis treatment, cassette 1100 needs to be secured to deck 1200 of tower system 2000, as is best illustrated in FIG. 25. Tabs 1102 and 1103 help position and secure cassette 1100 to deck 1200. Cassette 1100 has fluid inlet tubes 1106, 1107, 1108, 1109, 1110, 1111, and 1112 for receiving fluids into cassette 1100, fluid outlet tubes 1114, 1115, 1116, 1117, 1118, and 1119 for expelling fluids from cassette 1100, and fluid inlet/outlet tube 1113 that can be used for both introducing and expelling fluids into and out of cassette 1100. These fluid input and output tubes fluidly couple cassette 1100 to a patient being treated, as well as the various devices of photopheresis kit 1000, such as centrifuge bowl 10, irradiation chamber 700, treatment bag 50, plasma collection bag 51, and bags containing saline, anticoagulation fluid to form a closed-loop extracorporeal fluid circuit (FIG. 27). Pump tube loops 1120, 1121, 1122, 1123, and 1124 protrude from side wall 1104 of housing 1101. Pump tube loops 1120, 1121, 1122, 1123, and 1124 are provided for facilitating the circulation of fluids throughout photopheresis kit 1000 during therapy. More specifically, when cassette 1100 is secured to deck 1200 for operation, each one of said pump tube loops 1120, 1121, 1122, 1123, and 1124 are loaded into a corresponding peristaltic pump 1301, 1302, 1303, 1304, and 1305 (FIG. 4). Peristaltic pumps 1301, 1302, 1303, 1304, and 1305 drive fluid through the respective pump tube loops 1120, 1121, 1122, 1123, and 1124 in a predetermined direction, thereby driving fluid through photopheresis kit 1000 (FIG. 1) as necessary. The operation and automatic loading and unloading of peristaltic pumps 1301, 1302, 1303, 1304, and 1305 is discussed in detail below with respect to FIGS. 28-33. Turning now to FIG. 3, cassette 1100 is shown with housing 1101 in an exploded state. For ease of illustration and description, the internal tubular circuitry within housing 1101 is not illustrated in FIG. 3. The internal tubular circuitry is illustrated in FIG. 4 and will be discussed in relation thereto. Cassette 1100 has filter assembly 1500 positioned therein and in fluid connection with inlet tube 1106, outlet tube 1114, and one end of each of pump tube loops 1120 and 1121. Filter assembly 1500 comprises vent chambers 1540 and 1542. Filter assembly 1500, and its functioning, is discussed in detail below with respect to FIGS. 6-10. Housing 1101 comprises cover 1130 and base 1131. Cover 1130 has top surface 1105, a bottom surface 1160 (FIG. 5), and side wall 1104. Cover 1130 has openings 1132 and 1133 for allowing vent chambers 1540 and 1542 of filter assembly 1500 to extend therethrough. Side wall 1104 has a plurality of tube slots 1134 to allow the inlet tubes, outlet tubes, and pump loop tubes to pass into the internal space of housing 1101 for connection with the internal tubular circuitry located therein. Only a few tube slots 1134 are labeled in FIG. 3 to avoid numerical crowding. Tabs 1102 and 1103 are positioned on side wall 1104 so as not to interfere with tube slots 1134. Cover 1130 has occlusion bars 1162 and 1162A extending from bottom surface 1160 (FIG. 5). Occlusion bars 1162 and 1162A are preferably molded into bottom surface 1160 of cover 1130 during its formation. Base 1131 has a plurality of U-shaped tube-holders 1135 extending upward from top surface 1136. U-shaped tube holders 1135 hold the inlet tubes, outlet tubes, pump loop tubes, filter assembly, and internal tubular circuitry in place. Only a few U-shaped holders 1135 are labeled in FIG. 3 to avoid numerical crowding. Preferably, a U-shaped holder 1135 is provided on base 1131 at each location where an inlet tube, an outlet tube, or a pump loop tube passes through a tube slot 1134 on side wall 1104. Male extrusions 1136 protrude from top surface 1136 of base 1131 for mating with corresponding female holes 1161 located on bottom surface 1160 of cover 1130 (FIG. 5). Preferably, a male protrusion 1136 is located at or near each of the four corners of base 1130 and near filter 1500. Male protrusions 1136 mate with the female holes 1161 to form a snap-fit and secure base 1131 to cover 1130. Base 1131 further comprises a hub 1140. Hub 1140 is a five-way tube connector used to connect five tubes of the internal tubular circuitry. Preferably, three apertures 1137 are located near and surround three of the tubes leading into hub 1140. Hub 1140 acts as a centralized junction which can be used, in conjunction with compression actuators 1240-1247 (FIG. 22), to direct fluids through photopheresis kit 1000 and to and from the patient. In addition to hub 1140, appropriate tube connectors, such as T-connectors 1141 and Y-connector 1142, are used to obtain the desired flexible tubing pathways. Five apertures 1137 are located on the floor of base 1130. Each aperture 1137 is surrounded by an aperture wall 1138 having slots 1139 for passing portions of the internal tubular circuitry therethrough. An elongated aperture 1157 is also provided on the floor of base 1131. Apertures 1137 are located on base 1131 to align with corresponding compression actuators 1243-1247 of deck 1200 (FIG. 22). Aperture 1157 is located on base 1131 to align with compression actuators 1240-1242 of deck 1200 (FIG. 22). Each aperture 1137 is sized so that a single compression actuator 1243-1247 can extend therethrough. Aperture 1157 is sized so that three compression actuators 1240-1242 can extend therethrough. Compression actuators 1240-1247 are used to close/occlude and open certain fluid passageways of the internal tubular circuitry in order to facilitate or prohibit fluid flow along a desired path. When it is desired to have a certain passageway open so that fluid can flow therethrough, the compression actuator 1240-1247 for that passageway is in a lowered position However, when it is desired to have a certain fluid passageway closed so that fluid can not flow therethrough, the appropriate compression actuator 1240-1247 is raised, extending the compression actuator 1240-1247 through aperture 1137 or 1157 and compressing a portion of the flexible tubular circuitry against bottom surface 1160 (FIG. 5) of cover 1130, thereby closing that passageway. Preferably, occlusion bars 1163 and 1173 (FIG. 5) are positioned on bottom surface 1160 to align with the compression actuators 1240-1247 so that the portion of flexible tubing being occluded is compressed against occlusion bar 1163 or 1173. Alternatively, the occlusion bar can be omitted or located on the compression actuators themselves. It is preferable for cassette 1100 to have a unique identifier that can communicate with and relay information to permanent tower system 2000. The unique identifier is provided to ensure that the disposable photopheresis kit is compatible with the blood drive equipment into which it is being loaded, and that the photopheresis kit is capable of running the desired treatment process. The unique identifier can also be used as a means to ensure that the disposable photopheresis kit is of a certain brand name or make. In the illustrated example, the unique identifier is embodied as data card 1195 (FIG. 2) that is inserted into data card receiving port 2001 of permanent tower system 2000 (FIG. 17). Data card 1195 has both read and write capabilities and can store data relating to the treatment therapy performed for future analysis. The unique identifier can also take on a variety of forms, including, for example, a microchip that interacts with the blood drive equipment when the kit is loaded, a bar code, or a serial number. Cover 1130 has data card holder 1134 for holding data card 1195 (FIG. 1). Data card holder 1134 comprises four elevated ridges in a segmented rectangular shape for receiving and holding data card 1195 to cassette 1100. Data card holder 1134 holds data card 1195 in place via a snap-fit (FIG. 2). Referring now to FIGS. 1 and 4, the internal tubular circuitry of cassette 1100 will now be discussed. At least a portion of the internal tubular circuitry is preferably made of flexible plastic tubing that can be pinched shut by the exertion of pressure without compromising the hermetic integrity of the tube. Base 1131 of cassette 1100 is illustrated in FIG. 4 so that the internal tubular circuitry can be viewed. Inlet tubes 1107 and 1108 and outlet tube 1115 are provided for coupling cassette 1100 to centrifuge bowl 10 (FIG. 1). More specifically, outlet tube 1115 is provide for delivering whole blood from cassette 1100 to centrifuge bowl 10, and inlet tubes 1107 and 1108 are respectively provide for returning a lower density blood components and higher density blood components to cassette 1100 for further routing through photopheresis kit 1000. The lower density blood components can include, for example, plasma, leukocytes, platelets, buffy coat, or any combination thereof. The higher density components can include, for example, red blood cells. Outlet tube 1117 and inlet tube 1112 fluidly couple cassette 1100 to irradiation chamber 700. More specifically, outlet tube 1117 is provided for delivering an untreated lower density blood component, for example buffy coat, to irradiation chamber 700 for exposure to photo energy, while inlet tube 1112 is provided for returning the treated lower density blood component to cassette 1100 for further routing. Inlet tube 1111 and outlet tube 1116 couple treatment bag 50 to cassette 1100. Outlet tube 1116 is provided to deliver an untreated low density blood component, for example buffy coat, to treatment bag 50. Outlet tube 1116 has hematocrit ("HCT") sensor 1125 operably connected thereto to monitor for the introduction of a high density blood component, such as red blood cells. HCT sensor 1125 is a photo sensor assembly and is operably coupled to a controller. HCT sensor 1125 sends a detection signal to the controller when red blood cells are detected in outlet tube 1116 and the controller will take the appropriate action. Inlet tube 1111 is provided to return the untreated low density blood component from treatment bag 50 to cassette 1100 for further routing. Inlet tubes 1109 and 1110 are respectively connected to a saline and anticoagulant storage bags (not shown) via spikes 1190 and 1191 and are provided for delivering saline and an anticoagulant fluid to cassette 1100 for further routing to the patient. Inlet/Outlet tube 1113 and outlet tube 1118 couple plasma collection bag 50 to cassette 1100. More specifically, outlet tube 1118 delivers a blood component, such as plasma, to plasma collection bag 51. Inlet/Outlet tube 1113 can be used to either deliver red blood cells to plasma collection bag 51 from cassette 1100 or return the blood component(s) that build up in plasma collection bag 51 to cassette 1100 for further routing. Inlet tube 1106 and outlet tubes 1119 and 1114 are coupled to a patient. Specifically, outlet tube 1114 is provided to return treated blood, saline, untreated blood components, treated blood components, and other fluids back to the patient. Inlet tube 1106 is provided for delivering untreated whole blood (and a predetermined amount of an anticoagulant fluid) from the patient to cassette 1100 for routing and treatment within photopheresis kit 1000. Outlet tube 1119 is specifically provided for delivering an anticoagulant fluid to inlet tube 1106. It is preferable that all tubing is disposable medical grade sterile tubing. Flexible plastic tubing is the most preferred. Cassette 1100 has five pump tube loops 1120, 1121, 1122, 1123, and 1124 for driving blood fluids throughout cassette 1100 and photopheresis kit 1000. More specifically, pump tube loop 1121 loads into whole blood pump 1301 and respectively drives whole blood in and out of cassette 1100 via inlet tube 1106 and outlet tube 1115, passing through filter 1500 along the way. Pump loop tube 1120 loads into return pump 1302 and drives blood fluids through filter 1500 and back to the patient via outlet tube 1114. Pump loop tube 1122 loads into red blood cell pump 1305 and draws red blood cells from centrifuge bowl 10 and drives them into cassette 1100 via inlet line 1108. Pump loop tube 1123 loads into anticoagulant pump 1304 and drives an anticoagulant fluid into cassette 1100 via inlet tube 1124 and out of cassette 1100 to via outlet tube 1119, which connects with inlet tube 1106. Pump loop tube 1124 loads into recirculation pump 1303 and drives blood fluids, such as plasma, through treatment bag 50 and irradiation chamber 700 from cassette 1100. Each of peristaltic pumps 1301-1305 are activated when necessary to perform the photopheresis treatment therapy according to an embodiment of the method of the present invention which is described below in relation to FIGS. 26-27. Peristaltic pumps 1301-1305 can be operated one at a time or in any combination. The pumps 1301-1305 work in conjunction with compression actuators 1240-1247 to direct fluids through desired pathways of photopheresis kit 1000. Apertures 1137 and 1157 are strategically located on base 1131 along the internal tubular circuitry to facilitate proper routing. Through the use of compression actuators 1240-1247, the fluids can be directed along any pathway or combination thereof. 1. The Filter Assembly Filter 1500, which is located within cassette 1100 as described above, is illustrated in detail in FIGS. 6-10. Referring first to FIGS. 6 and 7, filter 1500 is illustrated fully assembled. Filter 1500 comprises a filter housing 1501. Filter housing 1501 is preferably constructed of a transparent or translucent medical grade plastic. However, the invention is not so limited and filter housing 1501 can be constructed of any material that will not contaminate blood or other fluids that are flowing therethrough. Filter housing 1501 has four fluid connection ports extruding therefrom, namely whole blood inlet port 1502, whole blood outlet port 1503, treated fluid inlet port 1504, and treated fluid outlet port 1505. Ports 1502-1505 are standard medical tubing connection ports that allow medical tubing to be fluidly connected thereto. Ports 1502-1505 respectively contain openings 1506, 1507, 1508 and 1509. Openings 1506, 1507, 1508 and 1509 extend through ports 1502, 1503, 1504 and 1505, forming fluid passageways into filter housing 1501 at the desired locations. Ports 1502, 1503, 1504 and 1505 are also used to secure filter 1500 within cassette 1100. In doing so, ports 1502, 1503, 1504 and 1505 can engage U-shaped fasteners 1135 of cassette 1100 (FIG. 3). Filter housing 1501 also has a protrusion 1510 extending the bottom surface of housing floor 1518. Protrusion 1510 fits into a guide hole of base 1131 of cassette 1100 (FIG. 3). Referring now to FIG. 8, filter 1500 is illustrated in an exploded state. Filter housing 1501 is a two-piece assembly comprising roof 1511 and base 1512. Roof 1511 is connected to base 1512 by any means known in the art, such as ultrasonic welding, heat welding, applying an adhesive, or by designing roof 1511 and base 1512 so that a tight fit results between the two. While filter housing 1501 is illustrated as a two-piece assembly, filter housing 1501 can be either a single piece structure or a multi-piece assembly. Base 1512 has chamber separation wall 1513 extending upward from a top surface of housing floor 1518 (FIG. 7). When base 1512 and roof 1511 are assembled, top surface 1515 of chamber separation wall 1513 contacts the bottom surface of roof 1511, forming two chambers within the filter housing, whole blood chamber 1516 and filter chamber 1517. Fluid can not directly pass between whole blood chamber 1516 and filter chamber 1517. Whole blood chamber 1516 is a substantially L-shaped chamber having floor 1514. Whole blood chamber 1516 has a whole blood inlet hole 1519 and a whole blood outlet hole (not illustrated) in floor 1514. Whole blood inlet hole 1519 and the whole blood outlet hole are located at or near the ends of the substantially L-shaped whole blood chamber 1516. Whole blood inlet hole 1519 forms a passageway with opening 1506 of inlet port 1502 so that a fluid can flow into whole blood chamber 1516. Similarly, the whole blood outlet hole (not illustrated) forms a passageway with opening 1507 of outlet port 1503 so that fluid can flow out of whole blood chamber 1516. Filter chamber 1517 has floor 1520. Floor 1520 has elevated ridge 1521 extending upward therefrom. Elevated ridge 1521 is rectangular and forms a perimeter. While elevated ridge 1521 is rectangular in the illustrated embodiment, elevated ridge 1521 can be any shape so long as it forms an enclosed perimeter. The height of elevated ridge 1521 is less than the height of chamber separation wall 1513. As such, when roof 1511 and base 1512 are assembled, space exists between the top of elevated ridge 1521 and the bottom surface of roof 1511. Elevated ridge 1521 and chamber separation wall 1513 form a trench 1524 there between. In order to facilitate fluid flow through filter chamber 1517, floor 1520 of filter chamber 1517 has treated fluid inlet hole 1522 and treated fluid outlet hole 1523. Treated fluid inlet hole 1522 is located exterior of the perimeter formed by elevated ridge 1521 and forms a passageway with opening 1508 of inlet port 1504 so that a fluid can flow into filter chamber 1517 from outside filter housing 1501. Treated fluid outlet hole 1523 is located interior of the perimeter formed by elevated ridge 1521 and forms a passageway with opening 1509 of outlet port 1505 so that a fluid can flow out of filter chamber 1517. Filter 1500 further comprises filter element 1530. Filter element 1530 comprises frame 1531 having filter media 1532 positioned therein. Frame 1531 has a neck 1534 that forms a filter inlet hole 1533. Filter element 1530 is positioned in filter chamber 1517 so that frame 1531 fits into trench 1524 and neck 1534 surrounds treated blood inlet hole 1522. Filter inlet hole 1533 is aligned with treated fluid inlet hole 1522 so that incoming fluid can freely flow through holes 1522 and 1533 into filter chamber 1517. Frame 1531 of filter element 1530 forms a hermetic fit with elevated ridge 1521. All fluid that enters filter chamber 1517 through holes 1522 and 1533 must pass through filter media 1532 in order to exit filter chamber 1517 via treated fluid outlet hole 1523. Filter media 1532 preferably has a pore size of approximately 200 microns. Filter media 1532 can be formed of woven mesh, such as woven polyester. Filter chamber 1517 further comprises filter vent chamber 1540 within roof 1511. Filter vent chamber 1540 has gas vent 1541 in the form of a hole (FIG. 9). Because gas vent 1541 opens into filter vent chamber 1540 which in turn opens into filter chamber 1517, gases that build-up within filter chamber 1517 can escape through gas vent 1541. Similarly, whole blood chamber 1516 comprises blood vent chamber 1542 within roof 1511. Blood vent chamber 1541 has gas vent 1543 in the form of a hole. Because gas vent 1543 opens into blood vent chamber 1542 which in turn opens into whole blood chamber 1517, gases that build-up in whole blood chamber 1516 can escape via gas vent 1543. FIG. 10 is a top view of filter 1500 having pressure sensors 1550 and 1551 connected to gas vents 1541 and 1543. Pressure sensors 1550 and 1551 are preferably pressure transducers. Pressure sensor 1550 is connected to gas vent 1541 via vent tubing 1552. Vent tubing 1552 fits into gas vent 1541 so as to form a tight fit and seal. Because gas vent 1541 opens into filter vent chamber 1540 which in turn opens into filter chamber 1517, the pressure in vent tubing 1552 is the same as in filter chamber 1517. By measuring the pressure in vent tubing 1552, pressure sensor 1550 also measures the pressure within filter chamber 1517. Similarly, pressure sensor 1551 is connected to gas vent 1543 via vent tubing 1553. Vent tubing 1553 fits into gas vent 1543 so as to form a tight fit and seal and pressure sensor 1551 measures the pressure within whole blood chamber 1516. Filter vent chamber 1540 and blood vent chamber 1542 extend through openings 1132 and 1133 of cassette 1100 when filter 1500 is positioned therein (FIG. 2). This allows the pressure within chambers 1516 and 1517 to be monitored while still protecting filter chamber 1500 and the fluid connections thereto. Pressure sensors 1550 and 1551 are coupled to controller 1554, which is a properly programmed processor. Controller 1554 can be a main processor used to drive the entire system or can be a separate processor coupled to a main processor. Pressure sensors 1550 and 1551 produce electrical output signals representative of the pressure readings within chambers 1517 and 1516 respectively. Controller 1554 receives on a frequent or continuous basis data representing the pressure within chambers 1516 and 1517. Controller 1554 is programmed with values representing desired pressures within chambers 1516 and 1517. Controller 1554 continuously analyzes the pressure data it receives from pressure sensors 1550 and 1551 to determine whether the pressure readings are within a predetermined range from the desired pressure for chambers 1517 and 1516. Controller 1554 is also coupled to whole blood pump 1301 and return pump 1302. In response to the pressure data received from pressure sensors 1551 and 1550, controller 1554 is programmed to control the speed of whole blood pump 1301 and return pump 1302, thereby adjusting the flow rates through the pumps 1301 and 1301. Adjusting these flow rates in turn adjust the pressure within whole blood chambers 1516 and filter chamber 1517 respectively. It is in this way that the pressure within the lines drawing and returning blood to and from the patient is maintained at acceptable levels. The functioning of filter 1500 during a photopheresis therapy session will now be discussed in relation to FIGS. 1, 6, and 10. While the functioning of filter 1500 will be described in detail with respect to drawing whole blood from a patient and returning a component of said whole blood back into the patient after it is treated, the invention is not so limited. Filter 1500 can be used in connection with almost any fluid, including red blood cells, white blood cells, buffy coat, plasma, or a combination thereof. Whole blood pump 1601 draws whole blood from a patient who is connected to photopheresis kit 1000 via a needle connected to port 1193. The rotational speed of whole blood pump is set so that the pressure of the line drawing the whole blood from the patient is at an acceptable level. Upon being drawn from the patient, the whole blood passes into cassette 1100 via inlet tube 1106. Inlet tube 1106 is fluidly connected to inlet port 1502 of filter 1500. The whole blood passes through opening 1506 of inlet port 1502 and into L-shaped whole blood chamber 1516. The whole blood enters chamber 1516 through inlet hole 1519 which is located on floor 1514. As more whole blood enters chamber 1516, the whole blood spills along floor 1514 until it reaches the whole blood outlet hole (not illustrated) at the other end of L-shaped whole blood chamber 1516. As discussed above, the whole blood outlet whole forms a passageway with opening 1507 of outlet port 1503. The whole blood that is within chamber 1516 flows across floor 1514, through the whole blood outlet hole, into outlet port 1503, and out of filter 1500 through opening 1507. As the whole blood passes through whole blood chamber 1516, gases that are trapped in the whole blood escape. These gases collect in blood vent chamber 1542 and then escape via gas vent 1543. Pressure sensor 1551 continuously monitors the pressure within blood chamber 1516 through vent tube 1553 and transmits corresponding pressure data to controller 1554. Controller 1554 analyzes the received pressure data and if necessary adjusts the speed of whole blood pump 1301, thereby adjusting the flow rate and pressure within chamber 1516 and inlet tube 1106. Controller 1554 adjust the pump speed to ensure that the pressure is within the desired pressure range. The whole blood then exits filter 1500 through outlet port 1503 and passes out of cassette 1100 via outlet tube 1115. The whole blood is then separated into components and/or treated as described in detail below. Before being returned to the patient, this treated fluid (i.e. treated blood or blood components) must be filtered. Untreated fluids such as red blood cells also must be filtered and will subjected to the below filtering process. The treated fluid is fed into filter chamber 1517 through opening 1508 of inlet port 1504. Inlet port 1504 is fluidly connected to pump loop tube 1120. The treated fluid enters filter chamber 1517 through inlet hole 1522 and passes through filter inlet hole 1533 of filter element 1530. The treated fluid fills filter chamber 1517 until it spills over frame 1531 of filter element 1530, which is secured to elevated ridge 1521. The treated fluid passes through filter media 1532. Filter media 1532 removes contaminants and other undesired materials from the treated fluid while at the same facilitating the release of trapped gases from the treated fluid. The treated fluid that passes through filter media 1532 gathers on floor 1520 of filter chamber 1517 within the perimeter formed by elevated ridge 1521. This treated fluid then passes into treated fluid outlet hole 1523 and out of filter 1500 through opening 1506 of outlet port 1502. The treated fluid is then returned to the patient via outlet tube 1114, which is fluidly connected to outlet port 1502. The treated fluid is driven through filter chamber 1517 and outlet tube 1114 by return pump 1302. Gases that are trapped in the treated fluid escape and collect in filter vent chamber 1540 as the treated fluid flows through filter chamber 1517. These gases then escape filter 1500 via gas vent 1541. Pressure sensor 1550 continuously monitors the pressure within filter chamber 1517 through vent tube 1552 and transmits corresponding pressure data to controller 1554. Controller 1554 analyzes the received pressure data and compares it to the desired pressure value and range. If necessary, controller 1554 adjusts the speed of return pump 1302, thereby adjusting the flow rate and pressure within chamber 1517 and outlet tube 1114. B. Irradiation Chamber FIGS. 11-16 illustrate irradiation chamber 700 of photopheresis kit 1000 in detail. Referring first to FIG. 11, irradiation chamber 700 is formed by joining two plates, a front and a back plate having a thickness of preferably about 0.06 in. to about 0.2 in., which are preferably comprised of a material ideally transparent to the wavelength of electromagnetic radiation. In the case of ultraviolet A radiation, polycarbonate has been found most preferred although other materials such as acrylic may be employed. Similarly, many known methods of bonding may be employed and need not be expanded on here. The first plate 702 has a first surface 712 and a second surface 714. In a preferred embodiment the first plate 702 has a first port 705 on a first surface 712, in fluid communications with the second surface 714. The second surface 714 of the first plate 702 has a raised boundary 726A defining an enclosure. The boundary 726A preferably extends substantially perpendicular from the second surface 714 (i.e. about 80-100 degrees). Extending from the second surface 714 (preferably substantially perpendicularly) are raised partitions 720A. The boundary 726A surrounds the partitions 720A. One end of each partition 720A extends and contacts the boundary 726A. The second plate 701 has a first surface 711 and a second surface 713. In a preferred embodiment the second plate 701 preferably has a second port 730 on a first surface 711, in fluid communications with the second surface 713. The second surface 713 of the back plate 701 has a raised boundary 726B defining an enclosure. The boundary 726B preferably extends substantially perpendicular from the second surface 713 (i.e. about 80-100 degrees). Extending from the second surface 713 (preferably substantially perpendicular) are raised partitions (720B). The boundary 726B surrounds the partitions 720B. One end of each partition 720A extends and contacts one side of boundary (726B). The joining of the second surfaces of the first and second plates results in a fluid tight junction between boundaries 726A and 726B thereby forming boundary 726. Partitions 720A and 720B are also joined forming a fluid tight junction thereby forming partition 720. The boundary 726 forms an irradiation chamber 700 and together with the partitions 720 provides a pathway 710 having channels 715 for conducting fluid. The pathway maybe serpentine, zig-zag, or dove-tailed. Currently preferred is a serpentine pathway. With reference to FIGS. 11 and 12, irradiation chamber 700 comprises a serpentine pathway 710 for conducting patient fluid, such as buffy coat or white blood cells, from inlet port 705 to outlet port 730, i.e., the serpentine pathway 710 is in fluid communication with inlet port 705 of front plate 702 and outlet port 730 of back plate 701. Patient fluid is supplied from cassette 1100 to inlet port 705 via outlet tube 1117. After photoactivation and passing through serpentine pathway 710, the treated patient fluid is returned to cassette 1100 via inlet tube 1112 (FIGS. 1 and 4). The patient fluid is driven by recirculation pump 1303. Self-shielding effects of the cells is reduced while the cells are photoactivated by irradiation impinging upon both sides of irradiation chamber 700. FIG. 11 shows pin 740 and recess 735 which align the two plates of irradiation chamber prior to being joined together in a sealing arrangement by RF welding, heat impulse welding, solvent welding or adhesive bonding. Joining of the plates by adhesive bonding and RF welding is more preferred. Joining of the front and back plates by RF welding is most preferred as the design of the raised partitions 720 and perimeter 725 minimizes flashing and allows for even application of RF energy. Locations of pin 740 and recess 735 may be inside serpentine pathway 710 or outside of serpentine pathway 710. FIG. 2 also shows a view of an irradiation chamber with axis L. Rotation of chamber 700 180 degree about axis L gives the original configuration of the irradiation chamber. The irradiation chamber of the present invention has C.sub.2 symmetry about axis L. Referring to FIGS. 11, 13, and 16, the leukocyte enriched blood, plasma, and priming solution are delivered through inlet port 705 of front plate 702 of irradiation chamber 700 into channel 715. The channel 715 in the irradiation chamber 700 is relatively "thin" (e.g. on the order of approximately 0.04'' as distance between two plates) in order to present large surface area of leukocyte rich blood to irradiation and reduce the self-shielding effects encountered with lower surface area/volume ratios. The cross section shape of channel 715 is substantially rectangular (e.g. rectangular, rhomboidal or trapezoidal) which has as its long side the distance between partition 720 and the distance between the plates as its short side. The shape of the cross section is designed for optimal irradiation of cells passing through channel 715. While a serpentine pathway 710 is preferred in order to avoid or minimize stagnant areas of flow, other arrangements are contemplated. The irradiation chamber 700 allows efficient activation of photoactivatable agents by irradiation from a light array assembly, such as the PHOTOSETTE.RTM.'s two banks of UVA lamps (758) for activation (FIG. 16). The irradiation plate and UVA light assembly (759) are designed to be used in a setting where edge 706 is oriented downward and edge 707 points upward. In this orientation, fluids entering input port 705 can exit from outlet port 730 with the aid of gravity. In the most preferred embodiment, irradiation of both sides of the irradiation chamber takes place concurrently while still permitting facile removal of the chamber. UVA light assembly 759 is located within UV chamber 750 of permanent tower system 2000 (FIGS. 17 and 18). The irradiation chamber's fluid pathway loops to form two or more channels in which the leukocyte-enriched blood is circulated during photoactivation by UVA light. Preferably, irradiation chamber 700 has between 4 to 12 channels. More preferably, the irradiation chamber has 6 to 8 channels. Most preferably, the irradiation chamber has 8 channels. FIG. 14 shows cut-away views of the irradiation chamber. The channels 715 of serpentine pathway 710 are formed by the joining of raised partition 720 and perimeter 726 of the plates. The irradiation chamber of the present invention can be made from a biocompatible material and can be sterilized by known methods such as heating, radiation exposure or treatment with ethylene oxide (ETO). The method of irradiating cells using irradiation chamber 700 during extracorporeal treatment of cells with electromagnetic radiation (UVA) to be used in the treatment of a patient (such as to induce apoptosis in the cells and administer the cells into the patient) will now be discussed. Preferably the cells treated will be white cells. In one embodiment of this method, a photoactivatable or photosensitive compound is first administered to at least a portion of the blood of a recipient prior to the extracorporeal treatment of the cells. The photoactivatable or photosensitive compound may be administered in vivo (e.g., orally or intravenously). The photosensitive compound, when administered. If administered intravenously, the times would be shorter. Alternatively, the photosensitive compound may be administered prior to or contemporaneously with exposure to ultraviolet light. The photosensitive compound may be administered to whole blood or a fraction thereof provided that the target blood cells or blood components receive the photosensitive compound. A portion of the blood could first be processed using known methods to substantially remove the erythrocytes and the photoactive compound may then be administered to the resulting enriched leukocyte fraction. In one embodiment, the blood cells comprise white blood cells, specifically, T-cells. The photoactivatable or photosensitive compound may, in the case of some psoralens, be capable of binding to nucleic acids upon activation by exposure to electromagnetic radiation of a prescribed spectrum, e.g., ultraviolet light. Photoactive compounds may. The photoactivatable or photosensitive compounds that may be used in accordance with the present invention include, but are not limited to, psoralen and psoralen derivatives; 8-methoxypsoralen; 4,5'8-trimethylpsoralen; 5-methoxypsoralen; 4-methylpsoralen; 4,4-dimethylpsoralen; 4-5'-dimethylpsoralen; 4'-aminomethyl-4,5',8-trimethylpsoralen; 4'-hydroxymethyl-4,5',8-trimethylpsoralen; 4',8-methoxypsoralen; and a 4'-(omega-amino-2-oxa) alkyl-4,5',8-trimethylpsoralen, including but not limited to 4'-(4-amino-2-oxa)butyl-4,5',8-trimethylpsoralen. In one embodiment, the photosensitive compound that may be used comprises the psoralen derivative, amotosalen (S-59) (Cerus, Corp., Concord, Calif.). See, e.g., U.S. Pat. Nos. 6,552,286; 6,469,052; and 6,420,570. In another embodiment, the photosensitive compound that may be used in accordance with the invention comprises 8-methoxypsoralen. Methoxsalen is a naturally occurring photoactive substance found in the seed of the Ammi majus (umbelliferae plant). It belongs to a class of compounds known as psoralens or furocoumarins. The chemical name is 9-methoxy-7H-furo[3,2-g][1]-benzopyran-7-one. The formulation of the drug is a sterile liquid at a concentration of 20 mcg/mL in a 10 mL vial. See. Toxicology studies of extracorporeal photopheresis and different dosages of UVADEX.RTM. and ultraviolet light in beagle dogs is located in the investigator's brochure. Next, the portion of the subject's blood, recipient's blood, or the donor's blood to which the photoactive compound has been administered is treated by subjecting the portion of the blood to photopheresis using ultraviolet light. The photopheresis treatment may be carried out using long wavelength ultraviolet light (UVA) at a wavelength within the range of 320 to 400 nm. Such a range is not limiting, however, but is merely provided as an example. The exposure to ultraviolet light during the photopheresis treatment may have a duration of sufficient length to deliver, for example, about 1-2 J/cm.sup.2 to the blood. The photopheresis step is carried out in vitro by installing irradiation chamber 700 into photoactivation chamber 750 of permanent tower system 2000 (FIGS. 17 and 18). In one embodiment, when the photopheresis step is carried out in vitro, at least a fraction of the treated blood is returned to the subject, recipient, or donor. The treated blood or the treated enriched leukocyte fraction (as the case may be) may then be administered back to the subject, recipient, or donor. The photopheresis process consists of three phases including: 1) the collection of a buffy-coat fraction (leukocyte-enriched), 2) irradiation of the collected buffy coat fraction, and 3) reinfusion of the treated white blood cells. This process will be discussed below in greater detail. Generally, whole blood is centrifuged and separated in centrifuge bowl 10. A total of approximately 240 ml of buffy coat and 300 ml of plasma are separated and saved for UVA irradiation. The collected plasma and buffy coat are mixed with heparinized normal saline and UVADEX.RTM.. (water soluble 8-methoxypsoralin). This mixture flows in a 1.4 mm thick layer through the irradiation chamber of the present invention. The irradiation chamber 700, is inserted in photoactivation chamber 750 of tower system 2000 between two banks of UVA lamps of the PHOTOSETTE.RTM. (FIG. 15). PHOTOSETTE.RTM. UVA lamps irradiate both sides of this UVA-transparent irradiation chamber 700, permitting exposure to ultraviolet A light, yielding an average exposure per lymphocyte of 1-2 J/cm.sup.2. Following the photoactivation period, the cells are removed from the irradiation chamber 700. In a preferred embodiment of the present invention the cells are removed by the action of gravity and any cells remaining in the chamber are displaced from the chamber with additional fluid selected from the group consisting of saline, plasma, and combinations thereof. For patients who are small such as children (e.g. under 30 kg) or patients whose vascular system is easily overloaded with fluids the amount of additional fluid used to was the irradiation chamber will preferably be not more than 2.times. the volume of the chamber, preferably not more than 1.times. the volume of the chamber, more preferably not more than 0.5.times. the volume of the chamber 0.25.times. the volume of the chamber. The treated cells volume is reinfused to the patient. For a description of similar photopheresis systems and methods, see U.S. patent application Ser. No. 09/480,893, which is expressly incorporated herein by reference. Also useful herein are the methods and systems described in U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,951,509; 5,985,914; 5,984,887, 4,464,166; 4,428,744; 4,398,906; 4,321,919; PCT Publication Nos. WO 97/36634; and WO 97/36581, all of which are entirely expressly incorporated herein by reference. The effective amount of light energy that is delivered to the biological fluids may be determined using the methods and systems described in U.S. Pat. No. 6,219,584, which is entirely expressly incorporated herein by reference. Indeed, the application of ECP to the various diseases described herein may require an adjustment of the amount of light energy to optimize the treatment process. Furthermore, the photosensitizing agent used in the ECP process may be removed prior to returning the treated biological fluid to the patient. For example, Methoxsalen (UVADEX.RTM.) is utilized in the ECP process. Methoxsalen belong to a group of compounds known as psoralens. The exposure to methoxsalen or other psoralens may cause undesirable effects on the subject, recipient, or donor such as phototoxicity or other toxic effects associated with psoralen and their decomposition products. Therefore, the psoralen, psoralen derivatives, or psoralen decomposition products that may remain in the biological fluid may be removed after UV exposure. A process for the removal of psoralen biological fluids is described in U.S. Pat. No. 6,228,995, which is entirely expressly incorporated herein by reference. C. Centrifuge Bowl In a specific embodiment, the present invention relates to methods and apparatus that separate fluid components, such as, for example, the components of a biological fluid by density or weight. Biological fluids encompass fluids that comprise, exist in, or are used in, or delivered to living organisms. Indeed, biological fluids may comprise bodily fluids and their components, such as blood cells, plasma, and other fluids that comprise biological components, including living organisms such as bacteria, cells, or other cellular components. Biological fluids may also comprise whole blood or specific whole blood components, including red blood cells, platelets, white blood cells, and precursor cells. In particular, it may be desirable to remove blood from a patient for treatment, such as for example, extracorporeal treatment. It is to be understood, however, that the present invention is adaptable to use with various centrifugal processing apparatus, and the specific example given herein is merely for illustrative purposes. Other uses for the separation techniques and apparatus may include other medical processes such as dialysis, chemotherapy, platelet separation and removal, and separation and removal of other specific cells. Additionally, the present invention may be used to separate other types of fluids that include a wide variety of non-medical uses, such as, for example, oil and fluid component separation. All components used in the present invention should not adversely affect biological fluids or render them unsuitable for their intended uses, such as those described herein and may be made of any suitable material compatible with uses described herein including, but not limited to plastics, such as polycarbonate, methyl methacrylate, styrene-acrylonitrile, acrylic, styrene, acrylonitrile or any other plastic. Where parts of the present invention are indicated to be attached together and form a fluid tight seal any appropriate conventional means of joining the parts may be used including but not limited to, adhesives, ultrasonic welding or RF welding. The present invention has several advantages over centrifuges what use conventional Latham bowl. The Latham bowl in the UVAR.RTM. XTS.TM. system has one inlet port that allows whole blood to come into the bowl and one outlet port that allows plasma and buffy coat to come out. Having only two ports limits the volume of buffy coat that can be collected per cycle. Each cycle involves filling the bowl with whole blood; 2) spinning the bowl to separate whole blood into plasma, buffy coat, and red blood cells; 3) collecting buffy coat for treatment, 4) bringing the bowl to rest; and 5) returning collected plasma and red blood cells. This buffy coat collection method may be characterized as being "batch-like" as the volume of buffy coat required for irradiation treatment can only be collected after several cycles of buffy coat collection. The limited volume of collected buffy coat per cycle results from the accumulated red blood cells remained inside the bowl. Thus the accumulated red blood cells that can only be emptied at the end of a buffy coat collection cycle is an inherent limitation of the Latham Bowl. The bowl of the instant invention has three separate fluid conduits that can be used as an inlet port and two outlet ports. The additional fluid conduits allows for 1) reduce patient treatment time by having continuous spinning during the entire buffy coat collection process without having to stop spinning the bowl for removal of accumulated red blood cells; 2) treat small blood volume patients; by having collected red blood cells returned to patients continuously, these patients may be more amenable to medical treatments requiring the use of the buffy coat or fractions thereof such as extracorporeal photopheresis; 3) better separation of different components of fractions of cells within the buffy coat due to the increased spinning or rotation time and 4) the ability to separate high density red blood cells fractions from whole blood. This centrifuge bowl also provides the opportunity for reduced treatment time for any medical procedure requiring buffy coat fractions to be collected from patients that are substantially free of red blood cells, such as extra corporeal photopheresis. To achieve the objects in accordance with the purpose of the present invention, as embodied and broadly described herein, FIGS. 35 and 36 depict specific embodiments of the present invention. The embodiment depicted in FIG. 35 comprises a centrifuge bowl 10A, conduit assembly 860A, frame 910A and stationary restraint 918A. The centrifuge bowl 10A is in fluid communications with external conduit 20A of conduit assembly 860A. Lower sleeve end 832A (FIG. 46) of connection sleeve 500A is secured to bowl 10A. Upper sleeve end 831A of connection sleeve 500A is secured to external conduit 20A, connecting the external conduit 20A to bowl 10A and providing fluid communications from external conduit 20A to bowl 10A. The fluid communications enables fluid 800 to be supplied through external conduit 20A to the bowl 10A. Similarly this fluid communications also enables separated fluid components 810 and 820 to be removed from bowl 10A through external conduit 20A. Bowl 10A and frame 910A are adapted to be rotated around center axis 11A. Referring to FIG. 36, bowl 10A comprises outer housing 100A, connection sleeve 500A, top core 200A, bottom core 201A, and housing floor 180A. Outer housing 100A may be constructed of any suitable biocompatible material as previously described for the purpose of the illustration in FIG. 36 the outer housing 100A is constructed of clear plastic so that cores 200A and 201A are visible there through. Outer housing 100A is attached to a housing floor 180A, which in turn comprises protrusions 150A for locking bowl 10A into a rotational device such as rotational device 900A. Bowl 10A is preferably simplified in construction and is easy to manufacture by molding or other known manufacturing processes, such that it may be disposable or used for a limited number of treatments, and is most preferably capable of containing about 125 ml of fluid, such fluid possibly being pressurized. In alternative embodiments, the volume capacity of the bowl may vary depending upon the health of the patient and his or her allowable extracorporeal volume. The volume capacity of the bowl may also vary depending upon the use of the bowl or the particular treatment for which the bowl is utilized. Additionally, to avoid contamination of biological fluids, or exposure of persons involved in the processing operation to the fluids, the transfer operations are preferably carried out within a sealed flow system, possibly pressurized, preferably formed of flexible plastic or similar material which can be disposed of after each use. As is illustrated in FIGS. 36 and 37, the outer housing 100A is substantially conical having an upper housing end 110A, an outer housing wall 120A and a lower housing end 190A. Outer housing 100A may be made of plastic (such as those plastics listed previously), or any other suitable material. Upper housing end 110A has an outer surface 110B, inner surface 110C and housing outlet 700A providing a passage between said surfaces. Preferably the upper housing will also have a neck 115A formed about the housing outlet 700A. The housing outlet 700A and neck 115A are sized to allow body 830A of the connection sleeve 500A to pass through while retaining sleeve flange 790A, which extends from the body 830A of connection sleeve 500A. In one embodiment of the present invention an o-ring 791A may be inserted between the sleeve flange 790A and inner surface 110C of the housing end 110A to ensure a fluid tight seal is provided. In an alternative embodiment of the present invention illustrated in FIG. 53, a second sleeve flange 790B extends from the body 830A of connection sleeve 500B distal to the sleeve flange 790A. Both sleeve flange 790A and 790B being adapted to fit within neck 115A and retain o-ring 791A therebetween. A fluid tight seal is provided in this embodiment by the o-ring contacting body 830A and inner surface 110C of the housing end 110A adjacent to the neck 115A. However, connection sleeve 500A can be secured to bowl 10A by any suitable means, including for example, a lip, groove, or tight fit and adhesive with a component of bowl 10A. The outer housing wall joins the upper housing end 110A and lower housing end 190A. Lower housing end 190A is attached to a housing floor 180A of greater diameter than upper end 110A. Housing floor 180A is adapted to mate with the lower housing end 190A and provide a fluid tight seal therewith. Any conventional means may be used to secure the lower housing end 190A to the housing floor 180A, including but not limited to, adhesives, ultrasonic welding or RF welding. Housing floor 180A may have an indentation 185A that is used to collect denser fluid 810. The diameter of outer housing 100A increases from upper housing end 110A to lower housing end 190A. Outer housing 100A is adapted to rotatably connect to a rotational device 900 (FIG. 35), such as for example, a rotor drive system or a rotating bracket 910. The rotatable connection may, for example, be a bearing that allows free rotation of bowl 10A. Outer housing 100A preferably has a locking mechanism. The locking mechanism may be one or more protrusions 150A designed to interact with corresponding indentations in a centrifuge container or any other suitable interconnect or locking mechanism or equivalent known in the art. The locking mechanism may also comprise a key slot 160 (FIG. 51). Referring to FIG. 37, outer housing 100A and the base 180A define an interior volume 710A in which cores 200A and 201A will fit when bowl 10A is assembled. When fully assembled, cores 200A and 201A are fully within interior volume 710A of outer housing 100A, occupying a coaxial volume of interior volume 710A about axis 11A. Referring to FIGS. 38, 40 and 44, the top core 200A and bottom core 201A are substantially conical and respectively have upper core ends 205A, 206A; outer core walls 210A, 211A; and lower core ends 295A, 296A. The cores 200A, 201A occupy coaxial volumes of interior volume 710A of bowl 10A and forming separation volume 220A between upper end 205A and outer wall 210A of top core 200A and outer wall 211A and lower core end 296A of bottom core 201A and outer housing 100A. Separation volume 220A is that space of interior volume 710A that is between cores 200A and 201A and outer housing 100A. As depicted in FIGS. 40 and 41 top core 200A comprises upper core end 205A and a lower core end 295A that are joined by outer core wall 210A. The outer core wall 210A having an outer surface 210B and inner wall surface 210C and a lower edge 210D. The diameter of top core 200A preferably increases from upper core end 205A to lower core end 295A. Upper core end 205A also comprises an outer surface 205B and an inner surface 205C. Centrally located about center axis and extending perpendicularly from the upper surface 205B is lumen connector 481A. Lumen connector 481A has a top surface 482A and a wall surface 482B. Top surface 482A has two passages 303B and 325D that provide fluid communications through the upper core end 205A with second bowl channel 410A and first bowl channel 420A respectively. Second bowl channel 410A is a conduit that has a conduit wall 325A that extends perpendicularly from the inner surface 481C of lumen connector 481A. As shown on FIGS. 39B, 39A and 40, second bowl channel 410 has fluid communication with conduit channel 760A through conduit 321A having a first end 321B and a second end 321C that is adapted to fit into passage 325D of lumen connector 481A. In operation conduit channel 760A of external conduit 20A has fluid communication with bowl channel 410A. First bowl channel 420A is a second conduit that has a channel wall 401A that extends substantially perpendicularly from inner surface 481C of the lumen connector 481A. As shown in FIGS. 39A, 39B and 40, first bowl channel 420A has fluid communication with conduit channel 780A of external conduit 20A through hollow cylinder 322A having a first end 322B and a second end 322C adapted to fit opening 303B top surface 482A. As is illustrated in one embodiment of the present invention, second bowl channel 410A is disposed within first bowl channel 420A. In an alternative embodiment of the present invention illustrated in FIG. 53, conduit wall 325A may be composed of upper part 325F and lower part 325G and be fused with channel walls 401A and 402A. Top surface 482A also has indentation 483A which provides fluid communications with chamber 740A. When assembled, chamber 740A is defined by lumen mounting recess 851A less the volumes occupied by hollow cylinders 321A and 322A in the connection junction of connection sleeve 500A and lumen connector 481A. Chamber 740A has fluid communication with conduit channel 770A and with separation volume 220A near neck 115A through indentation 483A. Thus indentation 483A forms a passageway for the removal of second separated fluid component 820 through bowl chamber 740A. Optionally present on the outer surface 205B are a plurality of spacers 207A which extend from the outer surface and contact the inner surface 110C of the upper housing end 110A to ensure fluid communications between the separation volume 220A and the passageway formed by the indentations 483A. In an alternative embodiment illustrated in FIGS. 53, 54 and 55, conduits 321A and 322A may be affixed to openings 325D and 303B in the top surface 482A of the lumen connector 481A. Additionally, indentations 483A may form a plurality channels in the lumen connector 481A and be adapted to form chamber 740B when connected to connection sleeve 500A or 500B. Chamber 740B is adapted to have one or more surfaces 742A that can mate with the male end 853A of the connection sleeve 500A (male end 853A surrounds end 861 of external conduit 20A). To facilitate the correct orientation of the connection sleeve 500A to the lumen connector 481A the shape of the male end 853A and chamber 740B may be nonsymmetrical or as is illustrated in FIGS. 53, 54 and 55 a guide 855A may be provided which extends from the top surface of the lumen connector 481A and is adapted to fit within opening 857A of the sleeve flange 790A. Referring back to FIG. 40, the lower core end 295A comprises an upper plate 299A having a top surface 298A, a bottom surface 297A, and an edge 299B that attaches and makes direct contact with lower edge 210D of the outer core wall 210A. The edge 299B of the upper plate 299A is adapted to be joined with lower edge 210D of outer core wall 210A and form a fluid tight seal therewith. Extending perpendicularly from the top surface 298A of upper plate 299A is a channel wall 402A, having an upper end 402B and a lower end 402C and surrounds opening 303A which is substantially in the center of upper plate 299A. A number of fins 403A, attached to the outside surface of channel wall 402A and top surface 298A, supports lumen wall 402A. The channel wall 402A is adapted to mate with channel wall 401A forming a fluid tight seal and providing lumen 400A. First bowl channel 420A is in fluid communications with conduit channel 780A of external conduit 20A through conduit 322A. Opening 303A provides fluid communications from lumen 400A to separation volume 220A as will be further discussed. First bowl channel 420A also surrounds second bowl channel 410A. Referring to FIGS. 43A, 43B and 44, bottom core 201A comprises an upper core end 206A, a outer core wall 211A and a lower core end 296A. The outer core wall 211A having an outer surface 211B, an inner wall 211C and lower edge 211D. The diameter of bottom core 201A preferably increases from upper core end 206A to lower core end 296A. Bottom core 201A also has a top surface 309A and a bottom surface 309B. Top surface 309A has an indentation 186A (preferably generally circular) substantial in the center of the surface 309A of the upper core end 206A. The indentation 186A has an upper surface 186B and an inner surface 186C. The upper surface 186B of the indentation 186A has therein an opening 324D which extends through to the inner surface 186C. In an alternative embodiment of the present invention illustrated in FIG. 53, the upper surface 186B, may also have a recess a 186D adapted to receive an o-ring and form a fluid type seal around the lower end of 325B of conduit wall 325A. Extending perpendicularly from inner surface 186C around said opening 324D is conduit wall 324A having a distal end 324B. On the top surface 309A extending from the indentation 186A to the outer surface 211B of the outer core wall 211A are one or more channels 305A. The top surface 309A may be horizontal or slope upward or downward from indentation 186A. If top surface 309A slopes upward or downward from indentation 186A to core end 206A, one skilled in the art would be able to adjust the shapes of upper plate 299A and upper core end 295A accordingly. Channels 305A may have an even depth through out the length of the channel 305A. However, channel 305A may slope downward or upward radially from the center. One skilled in the art would see that if top surface 309A slopes upward or downward and channel 305A has a constant depth, then channel 305A slopes upward or downward accordingly. Referring to FIG. 38, the bottom surface 297A of upper plate 299A is in direct contact with the top surface area 309A of bottom core 201A when completely assembled. This contact forms a fluid tight seal between the two surface areas forming an opening 305B from the indentation 186A to channel 305A. A second opening 305C from channel 305A is formed in the outer surface 211B of outer core wall 211A. The opening 305B provides fluid communications from indentation 186A through channel 305A and opening 305C to separation volume 220A (FIGS. 38 and 40). Thus fluid 800 flows through conduit channel 780A and subsequently passes through first bowl channel 420A. From first bowl channel 420A, fluid 800 then goes to through channel 305A to the separation volume 220A. Referring to FIGS. 43A and 44, the lower core end 296A has a lower plate 300A, which has a top surface 300B, a bottom surface 300C and outer edge 300D. Extending from the bottom surface 300C of the lower plate 300 are one or more protrusions 301A. The outer edge 300D is adapted to be attached to the lower edge 211D of the outer core wall 211A and provide a fluid tight seal therewith. Positioned above housing floor 180A, lower plate 300A is circular and curves upward radially from its center (illustrated in FIG. 44). Alternatively, lower plate 300A can be flat. As shown in FIG. 38 when positioned above housing floor 180A, a volume 220C exists between lower plate 300A and housing floor 180A. This volume 220C is in fluid communication with separation volume 220A. Lower plate 300A may be made of plastic or any other suitable material. Additionally, extending substantially perpendicularly from the lower surface 300C of lower plate 300A is a conduit 320A. Conduit 320A has a first end 320B that extends into the space 220C between lower plate 300A and housing floor 180A and a second end 320C that extends above the top surface 300B of lower plate 300A. The diameter of conduit 320A is adapted to have a tight fit with conduit wall end 324B. The volume inside conduit walls 324A and 325A comprises a lumen 400B. The volume defined by lower plate 300A, inner surface 211C, and ceiling 253A of bottom core 201A, excluding second bowl channel 410A, may comprise of air or a solid material (See FIGS. 43B and 44). In an alternative embodiment of the present invention as illustrated in FIG. 53, support walls 405A and 407A may be optionally present. Support wall 405A extends perpendicularly from bottom surface 309B. Support wall 407A extends perpendicularly from the top surface 300B of lower plate 300A and connects with support wall 405A when the bottom core 201A is assembled. Conduit wall 324A may be connected to conduit 320A to form a fluid tight seal and conduits 324A, 320A may be fused respectively with supports walls 405A and 407A. Additionally present extending from the bottom surface 300C of lower plate 300A are one or more orientation spacers 409A that mate within indentation 185A. As will be readily apparent to one of ordinary skill in the art, the bowl 10A will need to be balanced about center axis 11A. Accordingly, weights may be added as part of the device as is appropriate to facilitate the balancing of the bowl 10A such as weight 408A illustrated in FIG. 53. Referring to FIG. 38, bowl 10A is adapted so that outer housing 100A, cores 200A and 201A, lower plate 300A and upper plate 299A, housing floor 180A, external conduits 20A and connection sleeve 500A, and lumens 400A and 400B are in connection and rotate together. Housing floor 180A of outer housing 100A comprises recesses 181A on its top surface and these recesses are shaped to fit protrusion 301A of lower plate 300A. As shown, lower plate 300A has round protrusion 301A on its bottom surface 300C to restrict movement of lower plate 300A with respect to housing floor 180A. When assembled, each single protrusion 301A on the bottom surface of lower plate 300A forms a tight fit with recess 181A on housing floor 180A. Thus, when outer housing 100A is rotated, external conduit 20A and connection sleeve 500A, top core 200A, upper plate 299A, bottom core 201A, lower plate 300A, housing floor 180A, and lumens 400A and 400B will rotate therewith. As illustrated in FIG. 38 lumen 400A allows whole blood 800 to come into bowl 10A via a first bowl channel 420A. First bowl channel 420A provides a passageway for inflow of fluid 800 through lumen 400A to indention 186A and then to the separation volume 220A through channel 305A. Lumen 400A is located inside top core 200A. Lumen 400A has a height from upper lumen end 480A and lower lumen end 402C. Lumen 400A is formed by the connection of channel wall 401A extending from the inner surface 481C of lumen connector 481A and channel wall 402A extending from the top surface 298A of upper plate 299A. Channel wall 401A is supported by a plurality of fins 251A which are attached to the inner wall surface 210C of the outer core wall 210A and inner surface 205C of the upper core end 205A, and channel wall 402A is supported by a plurality of fins 403A (FIG. 40). It can readily be seen that height of lumen 400A can be adjusted by changing the sizes and shapes of core 200A, channel wall 401A, channel wall 402A, conduit wall 325A, and the height of conduit wall 324A. As illustrated in FIG. 38, lumen 400A, from upper lumen end 480A to lower lumen end 402C, encloses an inner lumen 400B. Lower lumen end 402C has an opening 303A which is in fluid communication with separation volume 220A through a number of channel 305A. In the illustrated embodiment lumen 400A comprises first bowl channel 420A. Second bowl channel 410A is located inside first bowl channel 420A of the top core 200A and is enclosed therein from lumen end 480A and to lumen 402C. Furthermore, second bowl channel 410A forms a passageway through lumen 400B from below lower plate 300A for the removal of a first separated fluid component 810 that gathers in indentation 185A of housing floor 180A. Second bowl channel 410A extends from housing floor 180A of outer housing 100A through lumen 400B and to conduit channel 760A of external conduit 20A. Referring FIG. 38 (shown without conduit 321C), inner lumen 400B allows red blood cells 810 to exit bowl 10A via a second bowl channel 410A that provides fluid communication from the housing floor above indentation 185A to opening 324E. Inner lumen 400B has an upper conduit end 325C and a lower conduit end 324B and comprises two conduit walls 324A and 325A which are connected in a fluid tight manner and form second bowl channel 410A that has a smaller diameter than and is separate and distinct from first bowl channel 420A. Conduit wall 325A is supported by a fin 251A that extends through channel wall 401A and attaches to conduit wall 325A. Unlike lumen 400A which has one end near indentation 186A, lumen 400B extends beyond indentation 186A and through bottom plate 300A. The first conduit wall 325A has an upper end 325C which has an opening 325D on the top surface 482A of lumen connector 481A and a lower end 325B having an opening 325E adapted to fit tightly with upper end 324C of conduit wall 324A. Upper end 324C of conduit wall 324A is higher than indentation 186A and has an opening 324D. Conduit wall 324A also has end lower end 324B and is supported by a plurality of fins 252A. Lower end 324B having opening 325E is adapted to connect to conduit 320A having opening 302A located near the center of lower plate 300A. The connection of openings 325E and 302A provide fluid communication between lumen 400B and the space 220C between lower plate 300A and housing floor 180A. The space 220C between lower plate 300A and housing floor 180A in turn has fluid communication with separation volume 220A. Conduit 320A provides a tight fit with lower end 324B, providing support for second bowl channel 410A. Each bowl channel 420A and 410A may be made of any type of flexible or rigid tubing (such as medical tubing) or other such device providing a sealed passageway, possibly for pressurized or unpressurized fluid flow, and which preferably can be disposable and sterilizable, i.e., of simple and efficient manufacture. 1. Drive Tube As illustrated in FIGS. 39A and 39B, conduit assembly 860A is attached to bowl 10A via connection sleeve 500A which is attached onto the first end 861A of external conduit 20A having a first conduit channel 780A, a second conduit channel 760A, and a third conduit channel 770A. Each conduit channel has fluid communication with a first bowl channel 420A, a second bowl channel 410A, and a bowl chamber 740A. The three conduit channels are equally spaced 120.degree. apart and equal in diameter in external conduit 20A (See FIG. 50). When fluidly connect to external conduit 20A and bowl 10A, conduit channel 780A is fluidly connected with first bowl channel 420A for inflowing fluid 800 from external conduit 20A into bowl 10A for separation. Similarly, second conduit channel 760A fluidly connects to second bowl channel 410A for removing first separated fluid component 810 from bowl 10A into external conduit 20A. Finally, third conduit channel 770A connects to bowl chamber 740A for removing second separated fluid component 820 from bowl 10A. As is illustrated in FIG. 45, external conduit 20A has a connection sleeve 500A on the first end 861A and an anchor sleeve 870A on the second end 862A of external conduit 20A. Optionally present between the connection sleeve 500A and the anchor sleeve 870A on external conduit 20A are a first shoulder 882 and a second shoulder 884 which extend perpendicularly from the external conduit 20A and are of a larger diameter. Between the connection sleeve 500A and anchor sleeve 870A (or if present the first and second shoulder 882, 884) are a first and second bearing rings 871A and 872A. External conduit 20A, anchor sleeve 870A, and connection sleeve may be prepared from the same or different biocompatible materials of suitable strength and flexibility for use in this type of tubing in a centrifuge (one such preferred material is HYTREL.RTM.). The connection sleeve 500A and the anchor sleeve 870A may be attached through any suitable means such as adhesives, welding etc., however, for ease of manufacture it is preferred that the connection sleeve 500A and the anchor sleeve 870A be overmolded to the external conduit 20A. Referring to FIGS. 45, 48 and 49 anchor sleeve 870A comprises a body 877B having a first anchor end 873A and second anchor end 874A. Anchor sleeve 870A is attached to second conduit end 862A of external conduit 20A (preferably by overmolding) and increases in diameter from first collar 873A to the collar 874A. Spaced distally from second end 874A is a collar 886A, which extends perpendicularly from body 877B and of a larger diameter than the body 877B of the anchor sleeve 870A. A plurality of ribs 877A having a first rib end 877B between the collar 886A and second anchor end 873A and a second rib end 877C extending beyond the first anchor end 873A are attached to the body 877B. The second rib ends 877C are joined together by a ring 880A, which is also attached to external conduit 20A. The ribs 877A run parallel to the external conduit 20A and are preferably placed over the region where conduit channels 760A, 770A, and 780A, are closest to the surface of the external conduit 20A (FIG. 50). The regions where the conduit channels 760A, 770A and 780A are closest to the outside diameter of external conduit 20A unless reinforced tend to fail during high speed rotation. Having ribs parallel with the conduit channels beyond the anchor sleeve end 873A provides reinforcement to this region and prevents conduit failure at high speed rotation. In one aspect, the ribs prevent the buckling of the external conduit 20A in this region and act as structural elements to transfer the torsional stress to the anchor sleeve 870A. Connection sleeve 500A comprises body 830A having an upper sleeve end 831A and lower sleeve end 832A (FIGS. 46 and 47). Lower sleeve end 832A has sleeve flange 790A and a plurality of protrusions 843A, which are sized to engage indentations 484A on the wall surface 482A of lumen connector 481A. When the bowl 10A is assembled, a fluid tight seal may be provided by placing o-ring 791A around body 830A and compressing the o-ring 791A between flange 790A and housing 100A. Upper sleeve end 831A is adapted to be secured to external conduit 20A. Referring to FIGS. 46, 39A and 39B, connection sleeve 500A is secured to bowl 10A by means of sleeve flange 790A and is adapted to fluidly connect conduit channels 780A, 760A, 770A of external conduit 20A to bowl channels 420A and 410A, and chamber 740A of bowl 10A. When assembled, connection sleeve 500A is mounted to lumen connector 481A (FIGS. 39A and 39B). Connection sleeve 500A preferably increases in diameter from upper sleeve end 831A to lower sleeve end 832A and is overmolded to first conduit end 861A of external conduit 20A. Connection sleeve 500A connects bowl 10A to external conduit 20A without use of a rotatable seal, which would otherwise normally be located between bowl 10A and connection sleeve 500A. The seal-less connection between bowl 10A and connection sleeve 500A may occur as explained above or alternatively through use of, for example, an O-ring, a groove, or lip, grommet-type connection, welding, or a tight fit with or without adhesive in either bowl 10A or connection sleeve 500A. As illustrated in FIGS. 46 and 39B, sleeve flange 790A has a bottom surface 847A that contacts with top surface 482A of lumen connector 481A forming a tight seal. However, lumen connector 481A has a plurality of indentation 483A that provides for fluid communication between separation chamber 220A and bowl chamber 740A, which, in turn has fluid communication with conduit channel 770A. Bowl chamber 740A is defined by lumen mounting recess 851A and top surface 482A of lumen connector 481A, excluding the space occupied by hollow cylinders 321A and 322A. A plurality of protrusions 843A on the bottom surface 847A of sleeve flange 790A engages and slides into indentations 484A on the wall surface 482B of lumen connector 481A, thus providing a tight fit. Connection sleeve 500A helps to secure external conduit 20A to bowl 10A, thus fluidly connecting external conduit 20A to bowl 10A. This fluid connection enables fluid 800 to be supplied through external conduit 20A to bowl 10A. Similarly, this fluid connection also enables separated fluid components b, 820 to be removed from bowl 10A through external conduit 20A. External conduit 20A has an approximately constant diameter which helps to reduce the rigidity. An excessively rigid external conduit 20A will heat up and fail more quickly. Additionally, a constant diameter conduit is cheap/easy to manufacture, allows easy experimentation with connection sleeve 500A and anchor sleeve 870A sizes, and allows bearing rings 871A, 872A to be easily slid thereon. Preferably the movement of bearings 871A and 872A will be constrained by first and second shoulders 882A and 884A. External conduit 20A may be made of any type of flexible tubing (such as medical tubing) or other such device providing a sealed passageway for the flow of fluids, which may be pressurized, into or out of a reservoir of any sort, and which preferably can be disposable and sterilizable. II. Permanent Tower System FIG. 17 illustrates tower system 2000. Tower system 2000 is the permanent (i.e., non-disposable) piece of hardware that receives the various devices of photopheresis kit 1000, such as, cassette 1100, irradiation chamber 700, and centrifuge bowl 10 (FIG. 1). Tower system 2000 performs the valving, pumping, and overall control and drive of fluid flow through disposable photopheresis kit 1000. Tower system 2000 performs all of the necessary control function automatically through the use of a properly programmed controller, for example a processor or IC circuit, coupled to all of the necessary components. While a new disposable kit must be discarded after each photopheresis therapy session, tower system 2000 is used over and over again. Tower system 2000 can be modified to perform a number of extracorporeal blood circuit treatments, for example apheresis, by properly programming the controller or by changing some of its components. Tower system 2000 has a housing having an upper portion 2100 and a base portion 2200. Base portion 2200 has a top 2201 and a bottom 2202. Wheels 2203 are provided at or near the bottom 2202 of base portion 2200 so that tower system 2000 is mobile and can easily be moved from room to room in a hospital setting. Preferably, the front wheels 2203 are pivotable about a vertical axis to allow ease in steering and maneuvering tower system 2000. Top 2201 of base portion 2200 has a top surface 2204 having control deck 1200, best illustrated in FIG. 22, built therein (see FIG. 22). In FIG. 17, cassette 1100 is loaded onto control deck 1200. Base portion 2200 also has hooks (not illustrated), or other connectors, to hang plasma collection bag 51 and treatment bag 50 therefrom. Such hooks can be located anywhere on tower system 2000 so long as their positioning does not interfere with the functioning of the system during therapy. Base portion 2200 has photoactivation chamber 750 (FIG. 18) located behind door 751. Additional hooks (not illustrated) are provided on tower system 2000 for hanging saline and anticoagulant bags. Preferably, these hooks are located on upper portion 2100. Photoactivation chamber 750 (FIG. 18) is provided in base portion 2200 of tower system 2000 between top 2201 and bottom 2202 behind door 751. Door 751 is hingedly connected to base portion 2200 and is provided for access to photoactivation chamber 750 and to allow the operator to close photoactivation chamber 750 so that UV light does not escape into the surrounding during treatment. Recess 752 is provided to allow tubes 1112, 1117 (FIG. 1) to pass into photoactivation chamber 750 when irradiation chamber 700 is loaded and when door 751 is closed. The photoactivation chamber is discussed in detail below with respect to FIGS. 16 and 18. Upper portion 2100 is located atop base portion 2200. Centrifuge chamber 2101 (FIG. 19) is located in upper portion 2100 behind centrifuge chamber door 2102. Centrifuge chamber door 2102 has a window 2103 so an operator can see in centrifuge chamber 2101 and monitor for any problems. Window 2103 is constructed with glass thick enough to withstand any forces that may be exerted on it from an accident during centrifugation which can rotate the centrifuge bowl at speeds greater than 4800 RPMs. Preferably, window 2103 is constructed of shatter-proof glass. Door 2102 is hingedly connected to upper portion 2100 and has an automatic locking mechanism that is activated by the system controller during system operation. Centrifuge chamber 2101 is discussed below in more detail with respect to FIG. 19. Preferably, deck 1200 is located on top surface 2204 of base portion 2200 at or near the front of system tower 2000 while upper portion 2100 is extending upward from base portion 2200 near the rear of tower system 2000. This allows the operator easy access to control deck 1200 while simultaneously affording the operator access to centrifuge chamber 2101. By designing tower system 2000 to have the centrifuge chamber 2101 in the upper portion 2100 and having the photoactivation chamber 750 and deck 1200 in base portion 2200, an upright configuration is achieved. As such, system tower 2000 has a reduced footprint size and takes up a reduced amount of valuable hospital floor space. The height of system tower 2000 remains below sixty inches so that one view is not obstructed when transporting the machine around the hospital form the rear. Additionally, having deck 1200 in a fairly horizontal position will provide the operator with a place to set devices of photopheresis kit 1000 during the loading of other devices, facilitating easy loading. Tower system 2000 is robust enough to withstand forces and vibrations brought on by the centrifugation process. A monitor 2104 is provided on centrifuge chamber door 2102 above window 2103. Monitor 2104 has a display area 2105 for visually displaying data to an operator, such as, for example, user interfaces for data entry, loading instructions, graphics, warnings, alerts, therapy data, or therapy progress. Monitor 2104 is coupled to and controlled by the system controller. A data card receiving port 2001 is provided on a side of monitor 2104. Data card receiving port 2001 is provided to slidably receive data card 1195 which is supplied with each disposable photopheresis kit 1000 (FIG. 1). As mentioned above, data card 1195 can be pre-programmed to store serve a variety of data to supply to the system controller of tower system 2000. For example, data card 1195 can be programmed to relay information so that the system controller can ensure: (1) that the disposable photopheresis kit is compatible with the blood drive equipment into which it is being loaded; (2) that the photopheresis kit is capable of running the desired treatment process; (3) that the disposable photopheresis kit is of a certain brand name or make. Data card receiving port 2001 has the necessary hardware and circuitry to both read data from, and write data to, data card 1195. Preferably, data card receiving port 2201 will record treatment therapy data to data card 1195. Such information can include for example, collection times, collection volumes, treatment times, volumetric flow rates, any alarms, malfunctions, disturbances in the process, or any other desired data. While data card receiving port 2001 is provided on monitor 2104, it can be located anywhere on tower system 2000 so long as it is coupled to the system controller or other appropriate control means. A. Photoactivation Chamber for Receiving Irradiation Chamber Referring now to FIGS. 16 and 18, photoactivation chamber 750 is illustrated in cross section. Photoactivation chamber 750 is formed by housing 756. Housing 756 fits within base portion 2200 of tower system 2000 behind door 751 (FIG. 17). Photoactivation chamber 750 has a plurality of electrical connection ports 753 provided on back wall 754. Electrical connection ports 753 are electrically coupled to a source of electrical energy. Photoactivation chamber 750 is designed to receive UVA light assembly 759 (FIG. 16). When fully loaded into photoactivation chamber 750, electrical contacts (not illustrated) located on contact wall 755 of UVA light assembly 759 form an electrical connection with electrical connection ports 753. This electrical connection allows electrical energy to be supplied to UVA lamps 758 so that they can be activated. Preferably, three electrical connection ports are provided for each set of UVA lamps 758. More preferably, UVA light assembly 759 has two sets of UVA lamps 758 forming a space which irradiation chamber 700 can be inserted. The supply of electrical energy to UVA lamps 758 is controlled by the properly programmed system controller using a switch. UVA lamps 758 are activated and deactivated as necessary by the controller during the photopheresis therapy session. Vent hole 757 is provided in the top of housing 756 near back wall 754 of photoactivation chamber 750. Vent hole 757 connects to vent duct 760 which leads out of the back of tower system 2000. When heat generated by UVA lamps 758 builds up in photoactivation chamber 750 during a treatment therapy, this heat escapes photoactivation chamber 750 via vent hole 757 and vent duct 760. The heat exits tower system 2000 through tower housing hole 761 located in the rear of tower system 2000, away from the patient and the operator. Photoactivation chamber 750 further comprises tract 762 for receiving irradiation chamber 700 and holding irradiation in an upright position between UVA lamps 758. Tract 762 is at or near the bottom of photoactivation chamber 750. Preferably, a leak detector circuit 763 is provided below tract 762 to detect any fluid leaks irradiation chamber 700 during, before, or after operation. Leak detector circuit 762 has two electrodes patterned in a U shape located on an adhesive backed flex circuit. The electrodes are designed to allow for application of a short circuit to test for discontinuities. One end of each electrode goes to an integrated circuit while the other end of each electrode is tied to a solid-state switch. The solid-state switch can be used to check for continuity of the electrodes. By closing the switch the electrodes are shorted to one another. The integrated circuit then detects the short. Closing the switch causes a situation equivalent to the electrodes getting wet (i.e., a leak). IN If the electrodes are damaged in any way, the continuity check will fail. This is a positive indication that the electrodes are not damaged. This test can be performed each time at system start-up or periodically during normal operation to ensure that leak detection circuit 762 is working properly. Leak detection circuit 762 helps ensure that leaks do not go unnoticed during an entire therapy session because the leak detection circuit is damaged. An electrical schematic of leak detector circuit 762 is provided in FIG. 20. B. Centrifuge Chamber FIG. 19 illustrates centrifuge chamber 2101 in cross section with the housing of tower system 2000 removed. Rotational device 900 (also in cross-section) capable of utilizing 1-omega 2-omega spin technology is positioned within centrifuge chamber 2101. Rotational device 900 includes a rotating bracket 910 and a bowl holding plate 919 for rotatably securing centrifuge bowl 10 (FIG. 1). Housing 2107 of centrifuge chamber 2101 is preferably made of aluminum or some other lightweight, sturdy metal. Alternatively, other rotational systems may be used within tower system 2000 such as that described in U.S. Pat. No. 3,986,442, which is expressly incorporated herein by reference in its entirety. Leak detection circuit 2106 is provided on back wall 2108 of housing 2107. Leak detection circuit 2106 is provided to detect any leaks within centrifuge bowl 10 or the connecting tubes during processing. Leak detection circuit 2106 is identical to leak detector circuit 762 described above. An electrical schematic of leak detection circuit 2106 is provided in FIG. 21. C. Fluid Flow Control Deck FIG. 22 illustrates control deck 1200 of tower system 2000 (FIG. 17) without a cassette 1100 loaded thereon. Control deck 1200 performs the valving and pumping so as to drive and control fluid flow throughout photopheresis kit 1000. Preferably, deck 1200 is a separate plate 1202 that is secured to base portion 2200 of tower system 2000 via screws or other securing means, such as, for example, bolts, nuts, or clamps. Plate 1202 can be made of steel, aluminum, or other durable metal or material. Deck 1200 has five peristaltic pumps, whole blood pump 1301, return pump 1302, recirculation pump 1303, anticoagulant pump 1304, and red blood cell pump 1305 extending through plate 1202. Pumps 1301-1305 are arranged on plate 1202 so that when cassette 1100 is loaded onto deck 1200 for operation, pump loop tubes 1120-1124 extend over and around pumps 1301-1305 (FIG. 25). Air bubble sensor assembly 1204 and HCT sensor assembly 1205 are provided on plate 1202. Air bubble sensor assembly 1204 has three trenches 1206 for receiving tubes 1114, 1106, and 1119 (FIG. 25). Air bubble sensor assembly 1204 uses ultrasonic energy to monitor tubes 1114, 1106, and 1119 for differences in density that would indicate the presence of air in the liquid fluids normally passing therethrough. Tubes 1114, 1106, and 1119 are monitored because these lines go to the patient. Air bubble sensor assembly 1204 is operably coupled and transmits data to the system controller for analysis. If an air bubble is detected, the system controller will shut down operation and prohibit fluid flow into the patient by occluding tubes 1114, 1106, and 1109 by moving compression actuators 1240-1242 to a raised position, thereby compressing tubes 1114, 1106, and 1119 against cassette 1100 as discussed above and/or shutting down the appropriate pump. HCT sensor assembly 1205 has trench 1207 for receiving HCT component 1125 of tube 1116. HCT sensor assembly 1205 monitors tube 1116 for the presence of red blood cells by using a photoelectric sensor. HCT sensor assembly 1205 is also operably coupled to and transmits data to the system controller. Upon HCT sensor assembly 1205 detecting the presence of red blood cells in tube 1116, the system controller will take the appropriate action, such as stopping the appropriate pump or activating one of compression actuators 1243-1247, to stop fluid flow through tube 1116. Deck 1200 also has five compression actuators 1243-1247 and three compression actuators 1240-1242 strategically positioned on plate 1202 so that when cassette 1100 is loaded onto deck 1200 for operation, each of compression actuators 1240-1247 are aligned with corresponding apertures 1137 and 1157. Compression actuators 1240-1247 can be moved between a lowered position and a raised position. As illustrated in FIG. 22, compression actuators 1243-1247 are in the lowered position and compression actuators 1240-1242 are in the raised position. When in a raised position, and when cassette 1100 is loaded onto deck 1200 as illustrated in FIG. 25, compression actuators 1240-1247 will extend through the corresponding apertures 1137 or 1157 and compress the portion of flexible tubing that is aligned with that aperture, thereby pinching the flexible tube shut so that fluid can not pass. When in the lowered position, compression actuators 1240-1247 do not extend through apertures 1137 and 1157 and thus do compress the flexible tubing. Compression actuators 1243-1247 are spring retracted so that their default position is to move to the lowered position unless activated. Compression actuators 1243-1247 are independently controlled and can be raised r lowered independent of one another. Compression actuators 1240-1242 on the other hand are coupled together. As such, when one compression actuator 1240-1242 is lowered or raised, the other two compression actuators 1240-1242 are also lowered in raised accordingly. Additionally, compression actuators 1240-1242 are spring loaded so that their default position is to move to the raised position. Thus, if the system loses power during a therapy session, compression actuators 1240-1242 will automatically move to the raised position, occluding tubes 1114, 1106, and 1119 and preventing fluids from entering or leaving the patient. Referring now to FIGS. 23 and 24, deck 1200 further includes system controller 1210, cylinder assembly 1211, manifold assemblies 1213, pump cable 1215, pump motor cable 1216, and timing belt assembly 1217. System controller 1210 is a properly programmed integrated circuit that is operably coupled to the necessary components of the system to perform all of the functions, interactions, decisions, and reaction discussed above and necessary to perform a photopheresis therapy according to the present invention. Cylinder assembly 1211 couples each of compression actuators 1240-1247 to a pneumatic cylinder. Air ports 1212 are provided on the various elements of deck 1200 as necessary to connect air lines to the devices and the appropriate one of manifolds 1213. As such, air can be provided to the devices as necessary to actuate the necessary component, such as compression valves 1240-1247. All of these functions and timing are controlled by system controller 1210. Timing belt assembly 1217 is used to coordinate the rotation of rotating clamps 1203. Finally, plate 1202 includes a plurality of holes 1215, 1219, 1220, 1221, and 1218 so that the various components of deck 1200 can be properly loaded into and so that deck 1200 can be secured to tower system 2000. Specifically, pumps 1301-1305 fit into holes 1314, HCT sensor assembly 1205 fits into hole 1220, air bubble detector assembly 1204 fits into hole 1219, compression actuators 1240-1247 extend through holes 1218, and bolts extend through holes 1221 to secure deck 1200 to tower assembly 2000. 1. Cassette Clamping Mechanism Referring now to FIGS. 22 and 25, the method by which cassette 1100 is loaded and secured to deck 1200 will now be discussed. In order for system 2000 to perform a photopheresis therapy, cassette 1100 must be properly loaded onto deck 1200. Because of the compression actuator valving system incorporated in the present invention, it is imperative that cassette 1100 be properly secured to deck 1200 and not shift or become dislodged when compression actuators 1240-1247 occlude portions of the flexible tubing by compressing the flexible tubing against cover 1130 of cassette 1100 (FIG. 3). However, this requirement competes with the desired goals of ease in loading cassette 1100 onto deck 1200 and reducing operator errors. All of these goals are achieved by the below described cassette clamping mechanism. In order to facilitate clamping of cassette 1100 to deck 1200, deck 1200 is provided with two catches 1208 and two rotating clamps 1203 and 1223. Catches 1208 have a slot 1228 near the middle of the top plate. Catches 1208 are secured to plate 1202 at predetermined positions so that the spacing between them is substantially the same as the spacing between tabs 1102 and 1103 on cassette 1100 (FIG. 2). Rotating clamps 1203 and 1223 are illustrated in a closed position. However, rotating clamps 1203 and 1223 can be rotated to an open position (not illustrated) manually or through the automatic actuation of a pneumatic cylinder. Rotating clamps 1203 and 1223 are spring loaded by torque springs so as to automatically return to the closed position when additional torque is not being applied. Rotating clamps 1203 and 1223 are linked together by timing belt assembly 1217 (FIG. 24). Referring now to FIG. 23, timing belt assembly 1217 comprises timing belt 1226, torque spring housings 1224, and tension assembly 1225. Timing belt assembly 1217 coordinates the rotation of rotational clamps 1203 and 1223 so that if one is rotated, the other also rotates in the same direction and the same amount. In other words, rotational clamps 1203 and 1223 are coupled. Tension assembly 1217 ensures that timing belt 1226 is under sufficient tension to engage and rotate the rotational clamp 1203 or 1223 that is being coordinated. Torque spring housings 1224 provide casings for the torque springs that torque rotational clamps 1203 and 1223 to the closed position. Referring back to FIGS. 22 and 25, when loading cassette 1100 onto deck 1200, cassette 1100 is placed at an angle to deck 1200 and tabs 1102 and 1103 (FIG. 2) are aligned with catches 1208. Cassette 1100 is moved so that tabs 1102 and 1103 slidably insert into catches 1208. Rotational clamps 1203 and 1223 are in the closed position at this time. The rear of the cassette 1100 (i.e. the side opposite the tabs 1102 and 1103) contacts rotational clamps 1203 and 1223 as tabs 1102 and 1103 are being inserted in catches 1108. As force is applied downward on cassette 1100, rotational clamps 1103 and 1123 will be rotated to the open position, allowing the rear of cassette 1100 to move downward to a position below ledges 1231 of rotational clamps 1203 and 1223. Once cassette 1100 is in this position, the rotational clamps 1203 and 1223 spring back from the force applied by the torque springs and rotate back to the closed position, locking cassette 1100 in place. When in the locked position, cassette 1100 can resist upward and lateral forces. To remove cassette 1110 after the therapy session is complete, rotational clamps 1203 and 1223 are rotated to the open position either manually or automatically. Automatic rotation is facilitated by an air cylinder that is coupled to an air line and system controller 1210. Once rotational clamps 1203 and 1223 are in the open position, cassette 1100 is removed by simple lifting and sliding tabs 1102 and 1103 out of catches 1208. 2. Self-Loading Peristaltic Pumps Referring to FIG. 24, peristaltic pumps 1301-1305 are provided on deck 1200 and are used to drive fluids through photopheresis kit 1000 (FIG. 1) along desired pathways. The activation, deactivation, timing, speed, coordination, and all other functions of peristaltic pumps 1301-1305 are controlled by system controller 1210. Peristaltic pumps 1301-1305 are identical in structure. However, the placement of each peristaltic pump 1301-1305 on deck 1200 dictates the function of each peristaltic pump 1301-1305 with respect to which fluid is being driven and along which pathway. This is because the placement of peristaltic pumps 1301-1305 dictates which pump loop 1220-1224 will be loaded therein. Referring now to FIGS. 28 and 29, whole blood pump 1301 is illustrated in detail. The structure and functioning of whole blood pump will be described with the understanding that peristaltic pumps 1302-1305 are identical. Whole blood pump 1301 has motor 1310, position sensor 1311, pneumatic cylinder 1312, pneumatic actuator 1313, rotor 1314 (best illustrated in FIG. 30), and housing 1315. Rotor 1314 is rotatably mounted within housing 1315 and is in operable connection with drive shaft 1316 of motor 1310. Specifically, rotor 1314 is mounted within curved wall 1317 of housing 1315 so as to be rotatable by motor 1310 about axis A-A. When rotor 1314 is mounted in housing 1315, a space 1318 exists between rotor 1314 and curved wall 1317. This space 1318 is the tube pumping region of whole blood pump 1301 into which pump loop tube 1121 (FIG. 33) fits when loaded for pumping. Position sensor 1316 is coupled to drive shaft 1316 of motor 1310 so that the rotational position of rotor 1314 can be monitored by monitoring drive shaft 1316. Position sensor 1311 is operably connected and transmits data to system controller 1210 (FIG. 24). By analyzing this data, system controller 1210, which is also coupled to motor 1310, can activate motor 1310 to place rotor 1314 in any desired rotational position. Housing 1315 also includes a housing flange 1319. Housing flange 1319 is used to secure whole blood pump 1310 to plate 1202 of deck 1200 (FIG. 22). More specifically, a bolt is extended through bolt holes 1320 of housing flange 1319 to threadily engage holes within plate 1202. Housing flange 1319 also includes a hole (not shown) to allow pneumatic actuator 1313 to extend therethrough. This hole is sized so that pneumatic actuator 1313 can move between a raised and lowered position without considerable resistance. Pneumatic actuator 1313 is activated and deactivated by pneumatic cylinder 1312 in a piston-like manner through the use of air. Pneumatic cylinder 1312 comprises air inlet hole 1321 for connecting an air supply line. When air is supplied to pneumatic cylinder 1312, pneumatic actuator extends upward through housing flange 1319 to a raised position. When air ceases to be supplied to pneumatic cylinder 1312, pneumatic actuator retracts back into pneumatic cylinder 1312, returning to the lowered position. System controller 1210 (FIG. 22) controls the supply of air to air inlet hole 1321. Curved wall 1317 of housing 1315 contains two slots 1322 (only one visible). Slots 1322 are located on substantially opposing sides of curved wall 1317. Slots 1322 are provided for allowing pump loop tube 1121 (FIG. 33) to pass into tube pumping region 1318. More specifically, pump inlet portion 1150 and outlet portions 1151 (FIG. 33) of pump loop tube 1121 pass through slots 1322. Turning now to FIGS. 30 and 31, rotor 1314 is illustrated as removed from housing 1315 so that its components are more clearly visible. Rotor 1314 has a top surface 1323, angled guide 1324, rotor flange 1325, two guide rollers 1326, two drive rollers 1327, and rotor floor 1328. Guide rollers 1326 and drive rollers 1327 are rotatably secured about cores 1330 between rotor floor 1328 and a bottom surface 1329 of rotor flange 1325. As is best illustrated in FIG. 29, cores 1330 fit into holes 1331 of rotor floor 1328 and recesses 1332 in bottom surface 1329. Guide rollers 1326 and drive rollers 1327 fit around cores 1330 and can rotate thereabout. Preferably, two guide rollers 1326 and two drive rollers 1327 are provided. More preferably, guide rollers 1326 and drive rollers 1327 are provided on rotor 1314 so as to be in an alternating pattern. Referring to FIGS. 29 and 31, drive rollers 1327 are provided to compress the portion of pump loop tube 1121 that is loaded into tube pumping region 1318 against the inside of curved wall 1317 as rotor 1314 rotates about axis A-A, thereby deforming the tube and forcing fluids to flow through the tube. Changing the rotational speed of rotor 1314 will correspondingly change the rate of fluid flow through the tube. Guide rollers 1326 are provided to keep the portion of pump loop tube 1121 that is loaded into tube pumping region 1318 properly aligned during pumping. Additionally, guide rollers 1326 help to properly load pump tube loop 1121 into tube pumping region 1318. While guide rollers 1326 are illustrated as having a uniform cross-section, it is preferred that the top plate of the guide rollers be tapered so as to come to a sharper edge near its outer diameter. Tapering the top plate results in a guide roller with a non-symmetric cross-sectional profile. The tapered embodiment helps ensure proper loading of the tubing into the tube pumping region. Rotor 1314 further includes cavity 1328 extending through its center. Cavity 1328 is designed to connect rotor 1314 to drive shaft 1316 of motor 1310. Referring now to FIGS. 30 and 32, rotor flange has opening 1333. Opening 1333 is defined by a leading edge 1334 and a trailing edge 1335. The terms leading and trailing are used assuming that rotating rotor 1314 in the clockwise direction is the forward direction while rotating rotor 1314 in a counterclockwise direction is the rearward direction. However, the invention is not so limited and can be modified for counterclockwise pumps. Leading edge 1334 is beveled downward into opening 1333. Trailing edge 1335 extends upward from the top surface of rotor flange 1325 higher than the leading edge 1334. Leading edge is provide for trailing edge for capturing and feeding pump loop tube 1121 into tube pumping region 1318 upon rotor 1314 being rotated in the forward direction. Rotor 1314 also has angled guide 1324 extending upward, at an inverted angle, from rotor flange 1325. Angled guide 1324 is provided for displacing pump loop tube 1121 toward rotor flange 1325 upon rotor 1314 being rotated in the forward direction. Preferably, angled guide 1324 has elevated ridge 1336 running along top surface 1323 for manual engagement by an operator if necessary. More preferably, angled guide 1314 is located forward of leading edge 1334. Referring now to FIGS. 28 and 33, whole blood pump 1301 can automatically load and unload pump lop tube 1121 into and out of tube pumping region 1318. Using position sensor 1311, rotor 1314 is rotated to a loading position where angled guide 1324 will face cassette 1100 when cassette 1100 is loaded onto deck 1200 (FIG. 25). More specifically, rotor 1314 is preset in a position so that angled guide 1324 is located between inlet portion 1150 and outlet portion 1151 of pump loop 1121 when cassette 1100 is secured to the deck, as is illustrated in FIG. 13. When cassette 1100 is secured to deck 1200, pump lop tube 1121 extends over and around rotor 1314. Pneumatic actuator 1313 is in the lowered position at this time. Once cassette 1100 is properly secured and the system is ready, rotor 1314 is rotated in the clockwise direction (i.e., the forward direction). As rotor 1314 rotates, pump tube loop 1121 is contacted by angled guide 1324 and displaces against the top surface of rotor flange 1325. The portions of pump loop tube 1121 that are displaced against rotor flange 1325 are then contacted by trailing edge 1325 and fed downward into tube pumping region 1318 through opening 1333. A guide roller 1326 is provided directly after opening 1333 to further properly position the tubing within tube pumping chamber for pumping by drive rollers 1327. When loaded, inlet portion 1150 and outlet portion 1151 of pump loop tube 1121 pass through slots 1322 of curved wall 1317. One and a half revolutions are needed to fully load the tubing. To automatically unload pump tube loop 1121 from whole blood pump 1301 after the therapy is complete, rotor 1314 is rotated to a position where opening 1333 is aligned with the slot 1322 through which outlet portion 1151 passes. Once aligned, pneumatic actuator 1313 is activated and extended to the raised position, contacting and lifting outlet portion 1151 to a height above trailing edge 1335. Rotor 1314 is then rotated in the counterclockwise direction, causing trailing edge to 1335 to contact and remove pump loop tube 1121 from tube pumping region 1318 via opening 1333. D. Infra-Red Communication Referring to FIG. 34, tower system 2000 (FIG. 17) preferably further includes a wireless infrared ("IR") communication interface (not shown). The wireless IR interface consists of three primary elements, system controller 1210, IRDA protocol integrated circuit, 1381, and IRDA transceiver port 1382. The IR communication interface is capable of both transmitting and receiving data via IR signals from a remote computer or other device having IR capabilities. In sending data, system controller 1210 sends serial communication data to the IRDA protocol chip 1381 to buff the data. IRDA protocol chip 1381 adds additional data and other communication information to the transmit string and then sends it to IRDA transceiver 1382. Transceiver 1382 converts the electrical transmit data into encoded light pulses and transmits them to a remote device via a photo transmitter. In receiving data, IR data pulses are received by a photo detector located on the transceiver chip 1382. The transceiver chip 1382 converts the optical light pulses to electrical data and sends the data stream to IRDA protocol chip 1381 where the electrical signal is stripped of control and additional IRDA protocol content. The remaining data is then sent to the system controller 1210 where the data stream is parsed per the communication protocol. By incorporating an IR communication interface on tower system 2000 real time data relating to a therapy session can be transmitted to a remote device for recording, analysis, or further transmission. Data can be sent via IR signals to tower system 2000 to control the therapy or allow protocols to be changed in a blinded state. Additionally, IR signals do not interfere with other hospital equipment, like other wireless transmission methods, such as radio frequency. III. Photopheresis Treatment Process Referring together to FIG. 26, a flow chart illustrating an embodiment of the invention which includes photactivation of buffy coat, and FIG. 27, a schematic representation of apparatus which can be employed in such an embodiment, the process starts 1400 with a patient 600 connected by means of a needle adapter 1193 carrying a needle, for drawing blood, and needle adapter 1194 carrying another needle, for returning treated blood and other fragments. Saline bag 55 is connected by connector 1190 and anticoagulant bag 54 is connected by connector 1191. Actuators 1240, 1241, and 1242 are opened, anticoagulant pump 1304 is turned on, and saline actuator 1246 is opened so that the entire disposable tubing set is primed 1401 with saline 55 and anticoagulant 54. The centrifuge 10 is turned on 1402, and blood-anticoagulant mixture is pumped 1403 to the centrifuge bowl 10, with the A/C pump 1304 and WB pump 1301 controlled at a 1:10 speed ratio. When the collected volume reaches 150 ml 1404, the return pump 1302 is set 1405 at the collection pump 1301 speed until red cells are detected 1406 at an HCT sensor (not shown) in the centrifuge chamber 1201 (FIG. 19). Packed red cells and buffy coat have at this point accumulated in the spinning centrifuge bowl and are pumped out slowly at a rate, controlled by the processor, which maintains the red cell line at the sensor interface level. The red cell pump 1305 is then set 1407 at 35% of the inlet pump speed while controlling 1408 the rate to maintain the cell line at the interface level until the collection cycle volume is reached 1409, at which point the red cell pump 1305 is turned off 1410 and the fluid path to the treatment bag 50 via the HCT sensor 1125 is opened by lowering actuator 1244, and stops when the HCT sensor 1125 detects 1411 red cells. "Collection cycle volume" is defined as the whole blood processed target divided by the number of collection cycles, for example a white blood process target of 1500 ml may require 6 cycles, and so 1500/6 is a volume of 250 ml. With whole blood continuing at 1410 to be delivered from the patient to the bowl and the red cell pump off, red cells will accumulate and will push out the buffy coat from inside the bowl 10. The red cells are used to push out the buffy coat and will be detected by the effluent hematocrit (HCT) sensor, indicating that the buffy coat has been collected. If another cycle is needed 1412, the centrifuge 10 effluent path is returned 1413 to the plasma bag 51 and the red cell pump 1305 rate is increased 1413 to the inlet pump 1301 pump rate until red cells are detected 1414, which is the beginning of the second cycle. If another cycle 1412 is not needed, the centrifuge 10 is turned off 1415 and inlet pump 1301 and anticoagulant pump 1304 are set at KVO rate, 10 ml/hr in this embodiment. The effluent path is directed 1416 to the plasma bag 51, the red cell pump 1305 rate is set 1417 at 75 ml/min, the recirculation pump 1303 and photoactivation lamps are turned on 1418 for sufficient period to treat the buffy coat, calculated by the controller depending on the volume and type of disease being treated. When the bowl 10 is empty 1419, the red cell pump 1305 is turned off 1420 and the plasma bag 51 is emptied 1421 by opening actuator 1247 and continuing return pump 1302. The return pump 1302 is turned off 1422 when the plasma bag 51 is empty and when photoactivation is complete 1423, the treated cells are returned 1424 to the patient from the plate 700 by means of the return pump 1302. Saline is used to rinse the system and the rinse is returned to the patient, completing the process 1425. The anticoagulant, blood from patient, and fluid back to patient are all monitored by air detectors 1204 and 1202, and the fluid back to the patient goes through drip chamber and filter 1500. The pumps, 1304, 1301, 1302, 1303, and 1305, the actuators 1240, 1241, 1242, 1243, 1244, 1245, 1246, and 1247, and the spinning of the bowl 10 are all controlled by the programmed processor in the tower. The process and related apparatus have significant advantages over prior processes and apparatus in that the invention allow buffy coat to be in the bowl longer since red cells are being drawn off while collecting buffy coat in the bowl while centrifuging, keeping more buffy coat in the bowl until the desired amount of buffy coat cells are collected prior to withdrawing the collected buffy cells. Platelets, leukocytes, and other buffy coat fractions can also be separated, or red cells can be collected rather than returning them with plasma to the patient as the illustrated process does. It has been found that increasing the time that buffy coat 810 is subjected to rotational motion in centrifuge bowl 10 yields a "cleaner cut" of buffy coat 820. A "cleaner cut" means that the hematocrit count (HCT %) is decreased. HCT % is the amount of red blood cells present per volume of buffy coat. The amount of time that buffy coat 820 is subjected to rotational motion in centrifuge bowl 10 can be maximized in the following manner. First, whole blood 800 is fed into first bowl channel 420 as centrifuge bowl 10 is rotating. As discussed above, whole blood 800 is separated into buffy coat 820 and RBC's 810 as it moves outwardly atop lower plate 300. Second bowl channel 410 and third bowl channel 740 are closed at this time. The inflow of whole blood 800 is continued until the separation volume 220 is filled with a combination of buffy coat 820 near the top and RBC's 810 near the bottom of centrifuge bowl 10. By removing RBC's 810 from centrifuge bowl 10 via second bowl channel 410 only, additional volume is created for the inflow of whole blood 800 and the unremoved buffy coat 820 is subjected to rotational forces for an extended period of time. As centrifuge bowl 10 continues to rotate, some of the RBC's 810 that may be trapped in buffy coat 820 get pulled to the bottom of centrifuge bowl 10 and away from third bowl channel 740 and buffy coat 820. Thus, when third bowl channel 740 is opened, the buffy coat 820 that is removed has a lower HCT %. By controlling the inflow rate of whole blood 800 and the outflow rates of buffy coat 820 and RBC's 810, a steady state can be reached that yields a buffy coat 820 with an approximately constant HCT %. The elimination of batch processing and the improved yields achieved by the current invention, have reduced the treatment time necessary to properly treat patients. For an average sized adult, 90-100 milliliters of buffy coat/white blood cells must be captured in order to conduct a full photopheresis treatment. In order to collect this amount of buffy coat/white blood cells, the present invention needs to process around 1.5 liters of whole blood. The required amount of buffy coat/white blood cells can be removed from the 1.5 liters of whole blood in about 30-45 minutes using the present invention, collecting around 60% or more of the total amount of the buffy coat/white blood cells that are subjected to the separation process. The captured buffy coat/white blood cells have an HCT of 2% or less. In comparison, one existing apparatus, the UVAR XTS, takes around 90 minutes to process 1.5 liters of whole blood to obtain the sufficient amount of buffy coat/white blood cells. The UVAR XTS only collects around 50% of the total amount of the buffy coat/white blood cells that are subjected to the separation process. The HCT of the buffy coat/white blood cells collected by the UVAR XTS is around, but not substantially below, 2%. Another existing apparatus, the Cobe Spectra.TM. by Gambro, must process 10 liters of whole blood in order to collect the sufficient amount of buffy coat/white blood cells. This typically takes around 150 minutes, collecting only 10-15% of the total amount of the buffy coat/white blood cells that are subjected to the separation process, and having an HCT of about 2%. Thus, it has been discovered that while existing apparatus and systems require anywhere from 152 to 225 minutes to separate, process, treat, and reinfuse the requisite amount of white blood cells or buffy coat, the present invention can perform the same functions in less than 70 minutes. These times do not include the patient preparation or prime time. The times indicate only the total time that the patient is connected to the system. * * * * *

Value for money and practicality are two things that are heavily embroidered into Skoda’s ethos. However, new special-edition Monte Carlo models play on another side to the brand that many won’t know about.
The new Yeti Monte Carlo is a tribute to 113 years of Skoda’s involvement with the Monte Carlo rally. Based on a standard SE, it comes only with the 168bhp 2.0-litre turbodiesel and all-wheel drive. There’s no power hike, but the engine is already the most potent available, so there’s some genuine performance to match its sporty look.
Gloss-black detailing on the roof, grille, rear diffuser and mirrors plus 17-inch alloys are the only exterior changes. Inside, however, the Yeti is as practical as ever, with a 416-litre boot and rear bench wide enough for three.
Yet the cabin itself is starting to look tired, so new sports seats, a perforated leather wheel and fake carbon-fibre trim have been introduced. They certainly liven things up, but Skoda’s obviously simply trying to mask the ageing design.
Don’t let the Monte Carlo’s lack of mechanical changes put you off, as the Yeti’s already one of the best crossovers on and off-road. While the diesel’s always been a little coarse, once into its stride it’s a gutsy performer with strong in-gear pace thanks to 350Nm of torque and a wide spread of power.
AWD gives a sense of real stability; with chunky tyres and SUV-like ground clearance, it can easily deal with tough off-road terrain. The ride can get choppy over ruts, but it’s mainly comfortable and sure-footed thanks to precise steering.
As standard the four-cylinder engine comes paired with a six-speed manual gearbox, but for an extra £1,100 you can have a six-speed DSG automatic. It’s good value for such a slick, accurate transmission, but the manual option is very well engineered and more involving. Plus, it’s better on fuel and quicker, with nearly 50mpg claimed and a 0-62mph time of 8.4 seconds.You suck it through your nose now?

I’m pretty sure you are over fertilizing. Too much fertilizer can kill the plant. If you are using brand new soil, many come already mixed with fertilizer so you shouldn’t have to fertilize all season. If not, then once a month is plenty.
I’ve never had much success growing tomatoes in planters (in the ground, yes). If it gets too hot, the plant fries in the box – so make sure you are watering well (veggie soil should always be moist).
I didn’t plant a garden this year — thought it would be too much with the baby. But now I miss having fresh veggies that are literally just footsteps away.
interesting…I just bought tomato fertilizer and followed the directions on the pack, and, in all honesty, I probably only have done it every 2 weeks or so…they say 7-10 days. but maybe I should try just laying off!
thanks for all the great tips!!!
I’ve tried planting tomatoes in containers on the back patio with absolutely no luck. Early in the season, I get blossoms, and I may even get a tomato or two. But I live in Texas and my patio faces west, and I think the Texas summer sun/heat is just too much for patio tomatoes.
Maybe next year I’ll plant them in the ground on the back fence to get some shade in the late/hottest part of the day.
I am no expert, but I think tomatoes love the heat and sun…does anyone who knows what they’re talking about have any help for angie?
I’m not an expert, but I’ve read that tomatoes love sun and heat, but only up to a certain point. After 95ish degree (+/- 5 degrees?) consistent temperatures, they start to die. Also, in hot parts of Arizona, tomatoes are grown much earlier and are pretty much done fruiting in early July.
Every year we plant tomato plants and they grow to astronomical sizes. We live in Northern California too (the East Bay) and the plants receive bright sunlight for most of the day. My mom, the gardener in family swears by a few things. She only puts one tomato plant per large pot, apparently any more and it restricts their growth. She also plants herbs around the tomatoes to fill up the base, but they are help keep the bugs away. Hope these tips help!
I’m also not an expert, but lots and lots of sun is what they need. I have a few pots on my deck, but unfortunately all the local animals keep lunching on them! I need to find a way now to keep them from getting eaten before we pick them.
Seriously those EarthBoxes are incredible! We started with one, and now have 6 because they just work so well. There’s something about them that they always yield so much more than what we have in ground or in other containers, our tomato plants also look like your friend’s does. Spend the money for them, you won’t regret it! (I have no affiliation with them what-so-ever either!)Print Options

OVERVIEW
This was the week when peak fall colors, estimated by many to be the best in years, spread over much of the Hudson River Valley. The seasonal transition was very apparent with snow in the High Peaks of the Adirondacks, big bluefish in the brackish lower river, and waves of autumn migrants heading south with our winter birds right on their tail.
HIGHLIGHT OF THE WEEK
10/19 - Coxsackie, HRM 124: When we pulled the boat docks and floats today from the Village of Coxsackie's waterfront, I could not find a single zebra mussel. Last year when we pulled the docks, every square inch of surface below the waterline was covered in a two-inch-thick mantle of zebra mussels.
- Rene VanSchaack
[Zebra mussel numbers are not down, but the larger zebra mussels are missing. There seem to be none out there older than one year. Therefore, their capability to filter the river has decreased and because of that some of the phytoplankton and zooplankton has begun to recover. Kathy Hattala.]
NATURAL HISTORY NOTES
10/17 - Ulster Park, HRM 87: The juncos have arrived in our yard so it must be autumn!
- Bill Drakert
10/17 - Town of Wappinger, HRM 67: This is the season when fallen leaves pile up in my yard. In most years I can find no useful reason to mulch more than once so the accumulation can be considerable. Today's damp leaves were "alive" with much rustling as though they were blowing in the wind. With a little patience I waited until the rustlers poked their heads up, revealing several white-crowned sparrows and at least one white-throated sparrow - winter birds searching for insects.
- Tom Lake
10/18 - Coxsackie, HRM 124: After many years as a natural resource manager and Coxsackie "river rat," I had my most extraordinary experience today. I was checking the mail box at my home along the river when the sound of something flapping caught my attention. Looking up, an adult bald eagle with a huge fish in its talons passed directly overhead at lower than roof-top level. The bird navigated the space between mine and my neighbor's house. I raced to the back of my house and was treated to the eagle and his dinner turning back, flying east over my head, taking a short arc over the river and then gaining altitude before flapping away over the tree line. I was breathless and my jaw hurt from the big grin on my face.
- Rene VanSchaack
10/18 - Hyde Park, HRM 82: A cold, wet day made for a slow-going morning. While watching for raindrops we spotted a beautiful coyote in our back yard. What a surprise! He was large with a beautiful thick coat and appeared very healthy. Not the thin scruffy version I held in my mind. He was busy sniffing the ground, hot on the trail of something. Where is the camera when you need it? We watched him for several minutes until the neighborhood crows arrived and chased him off. They must have known what he was after and wanted it for themselves. It was a great sight and a nice way to brighten a dreary morning.
- Jill Welch, Ken Welch
10/18 - Kowawese, HRM 50: A steady rain and stiff northeast wind made an already cold and dreary afternoon less appealing. We were on the windward side of Plum Point and the rising tide was capping over in a frothy white. The new moon flood tide had captured the beach and was steadily rising up and over the flood plain heading for the tree line. At the same moment that I thought to myself it was no day to be flying, the resident adult bald eagle glided off nearby Sloop Hill and spiraled upward, turning in small circles to look down at a hopelessly deep Cornwall Bay. Finding dinner would be a challenge today.
- Tom Lake, Phyllis Lake
10/18 - Croton Bay, HRM 34: The Boyz at the Bridge had themselves a day catching big bluefish to 16 lb. One boat came in with eight fish averaging 10 lb., and that many more that somehow had slipped the hook or broke the line. The action was on "bunker chunks," small hand-cut sections of Atlantic menhaden. Everyone wondered, however, where were the striped bass? Every bluefish was gorged with bunker, so there was plenty of fodder out there in the Tappan Zee and Haverstraw Bay.
- Christopher Letts
10/19 - Town of Esopus, HRM 88: It was mid afternoon and from across the ravine from my job site on River Road I heard a strange barking sound. I did my best to mimic it and a few minutes later a handsome red fox came loping through the tall grass and goldenrod. He did not see me until I spoke to him when he was a mere ten feet from me. He froze in his tracks for a few seconds, then warily turned away, and made a hasty retreat back down the trail. He looked healthy and well fed - a nice glossy coat with vibrant coloration.
- John Sperr
10/19 - Furnace Woods, HRM 38.4: An emphatic frost wiped out our squash and pumpkin patch and likewise did in the basil, cucumbers and eggplants. Rats. Tomatoes, beans and leafy crops survived and maybe those recalcitrant tomatoes will ripen before the next cold blast. One can hope.
- Christopher Letts
10/19 - Croton Point, HRM 35: Frost was thick on all the lowlands and the rain puddles from yesterday's nor'easter were skimmed with ice. There was an increase in the migratory bird pulse, with flocks of cedar waxwings, robins and red-winged blackbirds moving swiftly down the length of the Point to lift off where the distance across the Tappan Zee was lessened. The south side underbrush was thick with kinglets, warblers, and phoebes. The landfill was host to yet another wave of kestrels. I was able to harvest about 3 lb. of prime shaggy mane mushrooms and I planned a dinner menu as I walked: grilled bluefish cheeks (the best part of any fish) smothered in rich mushroom sauce would be the main course.
- Christopher Letts
10/19 - Croton Bay, HRM 34: As our Metro North commuter car crept along we could see a flock of about two dozen green-winged teal bobbing in the chop not far offshore. Many other groupings of waterfowl were spread across the bay but at a distance they all appeared as small, dark, silhouettes.
- Tom Lake
10/20 - Green Island, HRM 153: It seemed that our trees were at peak fall color. The soft, shadowless light of a cloudy day enhanced the colors. It was the most impressive display I had seen in recent years. When I was a child, it seemed like far fewer of Hudson Valley trees and shrubs were aliens or ornamentals. Through child's eyes I seem to recall that we saw classic autumn colors every autumn, and they arrived earlier. Colorful sugar maples seem to be fewer than they used to be. Climate change? They have been replaced in part by Norway maples that often linger into November before coloring, or just shedding brownish leaves. Our present "forests" often appear unbalanced in their makeup; in that regard, fall colors in the Hudson Valley become an international blend.
- Tom Lake
10/20 - Croton Point, HRM 35-34: We spotted four northern harriers soaring over the landfill and a kestrel perched on one of the well rods, presumably hunting. Along the south road adjacent to Croton Bay, a Cooper's hawk shot over the tree-tops and out across the bay. We watched a ruby crowned kinglet bouncing among the leaves in the bushes along the road. The best part, however, came as the sky dimmed about 6:30 PM, and we heard two great horned owls hooting and answering. We spotted one silhouetted in a tall tree over the campground. Then a screech owl started calling making it quite an owl chorus.
- Scott Horecky, Kathy Sutherland
10/21 - Green Island, HRM 153: The tide was extremely low; a line of gulls perched on the spillway of the federal dam gave testimony to the lack of water coming over. In the distance above the dam an immature bald eagle was perched in a hardwood tree. At my feet under a largely leafless cottonwood was a primary (wing) feather of an adult bald eagle. In the shallows along the shore I could see schools of small herring being chased by smallmouth bass. A Cooper's hawk cruised across the Hudson from Troy covering the entire breadth of the river without a single wing-beat. At low tide, this reach of the river, replete with opportunities, is like a deli for raptors.
- Tom Lake
10/21 - Ulster County, HRM 83: My neighbor raises goats and they have a herd of about twenty in a pasture that abuts the unpopulated Shawangunk Mountain side. Recently they butchered several of their flock and discarded the offal in the woods in the back of their property. An unintended consequence of this seems to have been to lure at least one large predator off the mountain to investigate this alluring scent. Late at night, my neighbor was wakened by the alarming barking of his two sheep dogs who patrol the pasture. He also heard a strange yowling cry which he described as being like a child crying. Going out to investigate he found the dogs chasing up and down the electric fence line while whatever it was prowled along outside, still emitting the yowls. Shining a large flashlight over the fence revealed a large tawny animal, the color of a deer and uniform in color, which bounded away like a deer, minus the white tail. My neighbor is convinced that what he heard and saw was a mountain lion.
- Sarah Underhill
[The possibilities in this case run from a bobcat to a coyote, and perhaps as an alternative, a mountain lion. We have had a spate of mountain lion "sightings" this year in the Hudson Valley, and one of these days one of them might turn out to be true. Tom Lake.]
10/21 - Beacon, HRM 61: The underbrush and shrubbery along the Klara Sauer Trail were filled with chipping sparrows and kinglets as well as white cabbage and clouded sulphur butterflies. A hatchling snapping turtle (34 mm carapace length) was on the path heading to the beach and certainly would not refuse our assistance. Then up popped a monarch, a large, healthy-looking butterfly. It seemed to flutter one step head of us as we walked the trail. Given the season, we had the realization that this monarch was also just a step ahead of autumn's first killing frost.
- Tom Lake, Cody Lake
10/22 - Nutten Hook, HRM 124: I paddled my little red kayak south from the historic ice house at Nutten Hook to the sheltered cove just to the north of Hudson River Islands State Park. I watched a spotted sandpiper teetering in the muck. The tide was coming in so quickly that the bird had to continually change its position to keep its underbelly from getting wet. It was interesting to note the birds' strategy to free its feet and legs from the mud flat: bend and lift from the knees, similar to a person wearing chest waders stuck in the mud using a seine net at dead low tide.
- Fran Martino
10/22 - Rhinebeck, HRM 100: In mid-morning I saw four turkey vultures, wings spread out, resting on perches about forty feet above the ground. They had taken over two banks of floodlights above the soccer field at Bard College just east of Tivoli Bays, in a symmetrical arrangement: Atop each pole are eight lamps, two rows of four. Below each vulture were four lamps, two rows of two.
- Phyllis Marsteller
10/22 - Hyde Park, HRM 82: This was the tenth anniversary of the serendipitous discovery (no one was looking for it) of the Hyde Park mastodont. These are an extinct form of "elephant" that roamed the Hudson Valley in the Late Pleistocene during the time when it is believed that the first Native Americans arrived here and the Hudson River was becoming an estuary.
- Tom Lake
[A cast (exact replica) of the Hyde Park mastodon is on permanent display at the Mid-Hudson Children's Museum in Poughkeepsie. The original animal stood ten-feet-high at the shoulder and weighed 10,000 lb. The 1999-2000 excavation was not unlike entering a time machine and the display gives us a great appreciation of the tremendous time-depth of our region. Tom Lake.]
10/22 - Croton Point, HRM 34: The highlights of our birding day were two vesper sparrows and, best of all, a very cooperative dickcissel. Earlier we had spotted numerous palm warblers as well as white crowned, swamp, and savannah sparrows. Pipits and killdeer have also been seen in good numbers this week at Croton Point but we did not see any this morning.
- Larry Trachtenberg, Charlie Roberto
10/22 - Bergen County, NJ, HRM 14-11: Forget Vermont! The autumnal colors here were the finest I have seen in many a season. As I walked the shore trail south the George Washington Bridge the woods were loaded with songbirds including warblers, sparrows, kinglets, and brown creepers, a life-long special bird for me. Winter wrens seemed to find aging stone walls and foundations irresistible; they pried and poked into every crack and cranny. Then they will spend ten minutes at a picnic table, an upside-down spider shopping mall.
- Christopher Letts
10/23 - Indian Brook, Putnam County, HRM 52: I woke up early to walk along the river and by the light of a misty morning I watched a brown trout, spotted and sure, rise and fall in the small upstream riffles of Indian Brook. In the waters of low tide, its large, shining body rested in small pools, preparing for the next push. Pleasured by the stamina and sleek body of this guest, I became most glad for its size as a rattling kingfisher breezed past overhead.
- Charley Wilkinson
10/23 - Furnace Book, HRM 38.5: The leaves came thundering down by the true millions. The mulching mower revealed a healthy greensward beneath the macerated leaves. Another puff of breeze and fresh hordes of leaves rattled down to cover my walk. This is our way of fertilizing the lawn and dealing with leaves. By spring not a vestige of a leaf will remain. No raking, bagging, and hauling of leaf bags. It works.
- Christopher Letts
10/23 - Croton Point, HRM 35-34: "Blowin' like stink," as the Lake Huron sailors like to say of a strong wind, as cascades of leaves came swirling down. White-crowned sparrows, bobolinks, white-throated sparrows, and juncos had returned. Many flocks of robins and cedar waxwings were moving through.
- Christopher Letts
10/23 - Bergen County, NJ, HRM 18: The wondrous colors that we somehow missed this season were in superabundance today. With big winds and soaking rain moving in, it will not last. But today! The colors were brilliant as well as subtle, healthy green on the oaks to crazed reds and oranges and yellows on the vines and on the maples. I was getting honked at while driving the actual speed limit on the Palisades Parkway. I moved to the parallel route 9W where the pace was slower and the colors even better. Every commute should be as rewarding.
- Christopher Letts
10/23 - Englewood, NJ, HRM 13.5: The bus filled with Ossining second-graders was on time, and a good thing. We caught the tide just right and made it out off the beach into the mud with the seine. This was not like yesterday, calm and balmy. With a long northeast fetch of river, we had white caps on the Tappan Zee and foot-high waves breaking on Bloomers Beach. The catch was not much, a few bay anchovies, juvenile blue crabs, a single white perch, and a couple silversides. The children did not have any expectations, so a three-inch blue crab and a five-inch perch spelled success.
- Christopher Letts
10/24 - Town of Goshen, HRM 52: The Carolina wren's morning song was soon joined by the "Old Sam Peabody, Peabody, Peabody" of a white-throated sparrow. The flick of the juncos white outer tail feathers were also here. Our winter birds had returned.
- Betsy Hawes

Posted on 03/16/2011 7:03:42 PM PDT by BenLurkin
Five people were killed Wednesday and another person was injured when a twin-engine plane crashed after departing from Long Beach Municipal Airport.
The Beechcraft King Air crashed in the northwest portion of the airport at 10:30 a.m., according to the Long Beach Fire Department.
An FAA spokesperson said the plane caught fire after crashing. Authorities said the plane, which was owned by local businessman Thomas F. Dean, was headed to Salt Lake City. A spokesperson for Dean says that Dean, Jeff Berger, Mark Bixby, an unidentified pilot and another passenger are among those dead.
The spokesperson also said that passenger Mike Jensen is in critical condition at Long Beach Memorial Medical Center.
FAA officials are investigating the cause of the crash.

Wow, I was driving by LB airport right when this happened! I saw the black smoke going up and figured it was just a fire drill or something. Sad, prayers for the family.
RIP.
Strange. Doesn't look as if there was much impact damage.
Should have been a survive-able accident, unless it was a flat spin impact, and notice there is no large account of skid marks behind A/C
?
Upright intact fuselage after a crash on departure? What was the weather at the time?
Look like it burned.
Appears in the picture to me to have hit the ground to the right side of the photo skidding in the direction to the left, and must have spun about as it skidded.
Curious about that NW side of the airport as I recall the airport on that side is totally asphalt, and structures, but then I worked on that airport in 1960, so my memory could be a tad faded. Seems to me the grassy areas were to the NE side of the airport.

Now that handheld screens have replaced messy stacks of paper, the new home office can be a minimalist cocoon of productivity and inspiration.written by: Alexander George07© The Financial Times Ltd 2015 FT and 'Financial Times' are trademarks of The Financial Times Ltd.
Growing interest in Latin America as a region in which to invest has presented its business schools with an opportunity – a chance to use their knowledge of the region’s markets and business practices as a marketing tool. Now, the question is how quickly these schools can start competing for applicants on the global stage.
It will not necessarily be easy. The rising economic prominence of Latin America has brought with it fresh challenges, particularly in the wake of financial difficulties in mature economies. With schools in the US and Europe facing falling applications, many have turned to Latin America as an alternative hunting ground for MBA candidates.
“Those business schools are becoming more aggressive in recruiting here,” says Arturo Condo, president of Costa Rica’s Incae Business School. “Executive MBA programmes are being marketed very aggressively in the region and schools from the US and Europe are even establishing campuses here.”
Schools from outside the region are also forming joint ventures in Latin America, as Manchester Business School has done through its partnership with Brazil’s Fundação Getulio Vargas (FGV) business school.
But if competition from global schools is increasing, the other side of the coin is that interest in the region’s economic potential could spark demand for what Latin American management education institutions have to offer.
Schools have certainly been gaining international credibility in recent years. For example, 12 per cent of schools appearing in the Financial Times’ 2012 executive education rankings (open and custom) are from Latin America, with the number of Latin American schools listed in the ranking rising from two in 2000 to 10 in 2012.
Regional rankings are becoming more popular, too. “More entities in Latin America are doing rankings focused on Latin America ...” says Douglas Viehland, executive director of the Accreditation Council for Business Schools and Programmes (ACBSP). This has been accompanied by more schools seeking accreditation. Latin American membership of the ACBSP has grown from one in 2005 to eight in 2009, 12 in 2010 and 18 today, says Mr Viehland.
Any international executive wanting to take an MBA in Brazil might be forgiven for being a little confused. Across the country, hundreds of low-cost MBA programmes are advertised at a wide range of educational institutions with few resembling an MBA elsewhere in the world.
“An MBA in Brazil is more like a one-year masters course at a UK university,” explains Nigel Banister, chief executive of Manchester Business School, which runs an executive MBA programme jointly with Brazil’s Fundação Getulio Vargas (FGV) business school.
“It’s confusing for executives in Brazil and there are massive numbers of people who take them after their first degree,” he adds.
No regulations govern what defines a Brazilian MBA programme and often the term simply denotes a masters degree that could be in subjects ranging from nursing to engineering.
“It’s a mess,” says Stavros Xanthopoylos, executive director of FGV. “You have the MBA associated with areas that are not even business.”
For FGV, the joint programme with Manchester Business School gives the school an added advantage when it comes to distinguishing itself from myriad Brazilian MBAs.
“We’re trying to position ourselves as a hub of entry into the country and the region,” adds Prof Xanthopoylos.
However, before looking outside the region for applicants, the first market Latin American schools have had to conquer is their own.
“There was a time when if you were wealthy in Latin America, you sent your children abroad to get a good education,” says Victoria Jones, executive director of the Business Association of Latin American Studies and former associate dean of international relations at FGV.
To increase their appeal to domestic students, some institutions have created overseas internships or study activities that bring international business experience to their degrees. “Schools want to offer students a way to stay in Latin America but to get global content,” says Mr Viehland.
Schools are also recognising that they have unique insights and knowledge that is hard to replicate in Europe or the US.
“The competitive angle for business schools in Latin America is that they are relevant to the local market,” says Prof Jones, who is now associate provost for global engagement at Seattle University. “While faculty may have been trained abroad, they’re bringing economic principles back and making them relevant in ways that foreign schools cannot.”
Further evidence of this can be found in course materials. “I’m seeing a lot more activity on the part of Latin American schools to develop their own case studies, as well as other teaching instruments that are based on the Latin American experience,” says Mr Viehland.
Given that more companies want to invest in the region and give their executives insight into local business environments, this “Latin American experience” could become a key marketing tool for schools.
“We have something to sell to the rest of the world – Latin America itself,” says Prof Condo. “If you want to come and do business in a region that’s growing relatively faster than the rest of the world, we have knowledge of what doing business in Latin America means.”
Access to teaching staff with knowledge and experience of economically and politically unstable environments could appeal to companies looking to invest in regions where instability is still a risk factor.
Cost may also be a factor. The relatively lower fees for a Latin American MBA – and lower living costs – could give schools an added competitive advantage.
But there are some barriers that could prevent regional schools from competing internationally for MBA recruits.
. . .
The first is language. Much course content remains in Spanish or Portuguese. And while schools are now increasing the proportion of the MBA taught in English, this might deter some international applicants.
Some schools are working to overcome this barrier. At Incae Business School in Costa Rica and Nicaragua, in the first year, two of the course sections are in Spanish with one in English. In the second year, students mainly take electives, half of which are in English. “Our goal is to make it bilingual English-Spanish,” says Prof Condo.
However, Prof Jones identifies a further barrier for the region’s schools to overcome – an image problem.
“Something has to happen to the image of Latin American schools – both inside the region and outside – before people will believe they’re going to get good value,” she says.
Part of this will involve shifting a traditional focus on teaching rather than research. Latin American schools have fewer PhD professors than in the US or Europe – something many are addressing by sending their teaching staff overseas to gain PhDs and develop new areas of knowledge.
Prof Condo also sees potential in the idea of getting schools together to market the region’s business education collectively. “There are big opportunities. But we have to adapt.”

I don’t often write about NASCAR (At least I haven’t to this point) simply because I don’t follow it very closely and thus didn’t feel I could provide much in the way of insight into NASCAR’s online & mobile products. However, my sister recently dumped cable and was looking for a way that my nephew, a big racing fan, to watch NASCAR races online. More specifically, a free solution to watch the races online. Especially those races that aren’t available on local TV. This led me to check out TNT’s Race Buddy this weekend.
Race Buddy is designed to be a complimentary product to “enhance” the TNT TV coverage. It’s similar in concept to TNT’s NBA Overtime Extra and MLB’s Postseason.tv. It delivers free (operative word) online coverage of all of TNT’s NASCAR races.
Race Buddy claims ten camera angles, but in reality it’s only eight. They seem to count the mosaic views as the 9th and 10th cameras, but they are really just a collection of 4 of the available cameras. Semantics, I guess.
There is constantly updated leaderboard below the video screens and an integrated chat feature that allows you to log in via Facebook, Twitter, or Yahoo and chat/comment along with other racing fans.
Each time you switch camera views, you are forced to watch a short commercial alongside a smaller view of the new camera view. This can get pretty annoying if you want to frequently change views.
During the race at Pocono there were 4 in-car views, a pit road view, a backstretch view, tow “battle” views and the 2 mosaic views. I thoroughly enjoyed the in-car camera views and spent most of my time watching the race from those views. The video isn’t HD, but it’s certainly good enough quality to enjoy.
There is no audio commentary, so it can be tough to understand what is going on at times if you aren’t also following along on TV. For instance, they went to a caution at one point and I had no idea why or how it happened. Perhaps listening along online would be a nice compliment to race buddy.
They do have the radio for the individual featured cars which I found to be really cool. However, it can be tough to understand at times over the roar of the cars themselves.
Race Buddy Schedule for the rest of 2012
June 17 – NASCAR Sprint Cup Series 400
June 24 – Toyota / Save Mart 350
June 30 – Quaker State 400
July 7 – Coke Zero 400
July 15 – Lenox Industrial Tools 301
Overview
I’m sure Race Buddy is no secret to NASCAR fans, but if it is, congratulations on discovering it. Race Buddy is a thoroughly impressive product. I’ll defer to the serious NASCAR fan, but from my experience it seems that NASCAR lends itself more to this type of product than most other sports. NASCAR action happens on other parts of the track other than what can fit on the TV screen at one time. Thus, more camera angles are better. Plus, I imagine fans of the drivers with the in-car views must find it particularly cool. Of the supplementary online viewing products I’ve seen, I find Race Buddy to be the best of the bunch.
Watch Race Buddy
Race Buddy is available beginning about an hour before each TNT broadcast race on NASCAR.com.

If you think the hacktivist collective Anonymous is nothing but a punishment brigade, #OpSocks might change your mind.
“Anonymous has always tried to help those that can't help themselves,” @TheLulzDeptxx wrote on the Pastebin page announcing the campaign. “Homeless people aren't asking for help but they desperately need it. It is come to our attention that socks are very important to helping homeless people stay healthy on the streets.”
Seattle’s Union Gospel Mission hands out over 15,000 pairs of socks every year, about 50 pairs per day.
Helping out, the organizer writes, “would mean a great deal to not only the homeless people but to the thousands of volunteers that help the Union Gospel Mission every year.”
The op is asking that Anonymous members and others visit the Union Gospel Mission’s website and buy six pairs of socks for about $10 via Amazon, which will send them to the mission.
Alternatively, you can buy the socks yourself and send them to the mission yourself.
The op seems to be capturing the imagination of folks on Twitter, who are gathering around the #OpSocks hashtag. It’s simple in concept and execution and it’s something virtually everyone can agree is a base-level decent thing to do.
“If you want a better community surrounding you, it is imperative to work towards making it better,” said @TheLulzDept.

Timothy Peters considered it a milestone victory.
It certainly was memorable.
Peters took the lead off a restart with 10 laps remaining to dash to victory in the NASCAR Camping World Trucks Series American Ethanol 200 Saturday night at Iowa Speedway. The win was the first of the season, allowing him to increase his season points lead to 12 over Justin Lofton.
“I love Iowa and I love going to places where our results are OK and turning them into a best finish,” Peters said. “Today was definitely a milestone in my career, I feel like, because I’ve never sat on the pole and never led like we did tonight to win the race.”
The Red Horse Racing driver claimed his first pole position of the season. He became the third trucks driver in four races to win from the pole.
Peters achieved it in dramatic fashion. A late wreck forced a seventh caution with less than 20 laps remaining to set up the final restart between Peters and veteran Ron Hornaday Jr. When Hornaday spun his tires slightly at the starting lineup, Peters moved ahead, never looked back and pulled away for his fourth career win..Note: To protect the privacy of our members, e-mail addresses have been removed from the archived messages.

This thread reminds me of a time several years ago when I was working with an after school school-age program at a day care. Over the period of several days, I kept noticing a group of 3 or 4 boys, age about 10 - 12, huddled in a corner looking at an encyclopedia from the room set. I figured that the voulme would be maybe "H" for human anatomy, or "R" for reproductive system, but no, they were looking at "I"! If I got close enough to find out what they were looking at, they would be studiously examining "instects" or "India". Finally one day, I got the "I" volume out to see what could possibly be so "interesting". There it was, the most fascinating article in the book - "Ingres", complete with a reproduction (and only in black and white!) of "La Grande Odalisque"! The next time I noticed the furtive little huddle, I sneaked up on them and said, "Oh, I see you're interested in the art of Ingres! I hope you read the article so we can talk about why this painting is considered so great!" and walked away. I never saw them in their huddle again! :-)

Apparently, to succeed, you have to work really hard.
That’s the word from three romance novelists, all of whom appeared Saturday at the Camden County Library in Voorhees.
I interviewed the authors, expecting to chat about ripped bodices, heaving bosoms and throbbing ... um ... passions. But I quickly learned they were committed to a labor of love — with the emphasis on labor.
“There was a time when writers could just sit down and write,” said Tina Gabrielle of Cinnaminson, who’s set five romances in 19th century England. “Today, we have to have blogs and we tweet and we Facebook. We try to promote the book without forcing it down somebody’s throat.”
“It’s almost like having two full-time jobs,” added Kathleen Long, a Cherry Hill author of 15 books.
Indeed, these days, writers don’t just craft fictitious characters.
Consider the website for Terri Brisbin of Berlin Borough, who’s written more than 30 books about love in long-ago Scotland. It shows a castle rising dramatically in a Highlands setting, the scene tinted purple by a gathering dusk. Two gleaming swords stretch beneath Brisbin’s name and what might be a racy royal motto: “Compelling, sexy historical romance.”
“An author today is a platform and a brand,” explained Brisbin. “It’s a career, not a hobby.”
Now, I didn’t have time to read their books, but the titles are just great.
Brisbin’s “Yield to the Highlander” suggests an intriguing twist to traffic rules in Glasgow. And a series by Gabrielle proceeds from “In the Barrister’s Chambers” to “In the Barrister’s Bed.” Up next, I bet: “Watching the Barrister Sleep.”
The covers are pretty dramatic, too.
For instance, I hadn’t realized Scotland’s climate is so mild that men there can wear kilts and nothing else — unless you count the occasional straps that barely restrain their rippling muscles.
“There’s nothing wrong with a man in a kilt,” declared Brisbin, 58, who’s sold more than 1.7 million copies of her works. “Clearly it resonates with women.”
Brisbin has repeatedly visited Scotland to ensure her books are authentic. On her latest trip, in 2009, she traveled alone through the countryside for more than three weeks.
I’d like to think at some point her car broke down on a lonely moor. Then, a rugged but sensitive fellow emerged from the heather to help guide her on the path to self-discovery. Call that one “The Kilt Whisperer.”
Gabrielle — a former mechanical engineer who also worked as an attorney before her first book debuted in 2009 — conducts much of her research in libraries and online. “I’ve traveled a lot, but I’ve never been to London in the 1800s,” she explained.
Her website notes Gabrielle’s offered workshops to aspiring writers, giving tips on how to pitch a book and land a contract. One of her topics would not interest romance-novel coverboys: “How to use conflict to get past the dreaded sagging middle.”
“There are even workshops we can take on how to write and think like a man,” said Gabrielle, 42. OK, but you could just drink heavily and get the same effect.
The writers say their genre has a few guidelines — heroes should be underdogs; heroines, plucky and determined — but only one unbreakable rule.
Love conquers all.
“It has to have the happily ever after — always. That’s what women want,” said Gabrielle.
But even that commandment might be tweaked under the right circumstances, suggests Brisbin. “Generally, if they end up dying, it’s not a romance — unless they’re dead and paranormal.”
The workload becomes even more challenging when an author’s own romance results in children.
“I used to be a morning writer,” said Long, 50, whose schedule changed with her daughter’s birth eight years ago. “I’ve learned to write at night — and my brain is definitely a morning brain.”
Gabrielle, who has two young daughters, shares that view. At her website, the writer says she’s learned “to grab time and use it when I can” on nights and weekends.
“That being said, I do have a publishing contract (that) requires me to complete a 100,000-word manuscript ... in less than a year.”
It all sounds so grueling I’m tempted to cry out: “Wake up and smell the tea, m’lady! Too much ardor can make ye a martyr!“
But only a guy would think less is amour.
“I wouldn’t be writing romance if I didn’t love it,” Gabrielle assured me. “It’s been happily-ever-after, at least so far.”

It’s part of the Buddha’s life story.
It could easily be skipped over when the story is told, but it usually isn’t. Before he was the Buddha, Siddhartha was a prince. He didn’t even start his spiritual journey until the age of 29. He was married to a woman named Yasodhara, which makes sense given his status and the culture of the time.
It would have been a conspicuous story if he was not married before his spiritual journey. He was married and shortly before he left the palace to start his spiritual journey, he had a son named Rahula. He left his wife and son behind to embark on the spiritual quest.
In the modern world, we sometimes struggle with this part of the story. His son was just born and he left. He didn’t know how long his spiritual journey would take but he left anyway. He felt a great desire to find the end of suffering and he thought that that was more important than his own desires and the needs of his family. He was gone for years.
Now, to be fair for a second, he didn’t leave his wife with a child to care for and no means to do it. When we think of deadbeat dads we think of children left with nothing. Rahula did still grow up in the palace of Siddhartha’s father and he almost certainly had all of his needs met…except that he didn’t know his father.
This is what we need to remember. This is a story. It’s a mythic narrative. Some of it is probably true and some of it isn’t. (Does anyone really believe the Buddha spoke the moment he was born?)
We also need to remember that there are two versions of the ideal Buddhist. One is the Arhat, who retreats from the world to pursue the spiritual journey. The other is the Bodhisattva, who lives in the world and does everything to help others while pursuing the spiritual journey.
The Arhat ideal basically says the best thing one can do is leave family life and become a monk. It’s the older ideal and one that the Buddha’s life story resonates with.
The Bodhisattva ideal hadn’t been conceived yet when this story was written.
The concept of Buddha nature is a more recent development within Buddhism. It’s the notion that we are all enlightened already, that it’s just something we have to uncover, not something to attain. If we believe in Buddha nature, then did Siddhartha have to leave his family? Could he have stayed with them? Could he have gone for the Bodhisattva ideal instead?
Why not?
If enlightenment is within us, then what’s the difference between going away to a monastery and staying in the world?
I hope people don’t get too hung up on it.
It’s just a Daniel,
As a Zen priest and family man with a wife and 2 wonderful kids, I too struggled with this aspect of the Buddha’s life. It is not a message for everyone’s life and I most certainly don’t think people should leave their families in general to pursue a “spiritual” life, of course there are always extremes. Yet , in one sense, since the Buudha found The Path, we can all benefit from his wisdom and guidance without without leaving our families or the world and torturing ourselves as aesthetics. That is the peace I came to in regards to this story. It still must have caused much pain to his wife and son as he grew up at times I’m sure. Eventually he returns home and teaches his own family and Rahula even joins the Sangha as a monastic.
If you want a story/myth that explains and gives a reason to lessen the blow of the Buddha leaving his family, read Chapter 36, titled “Lotus Vow,” of Thich Nhat Hanh’s amazing narative biography of the Buddha’s life, “Old Paths, White Clouds.” This book to me is one of my all-time favorites and hands down the best bio of the buddha’s life and I have read many. It reads like a movie, a real page turner and you feel like you were there. It truly moved me in many places. Basically, the Lotus Vow was a vow taken by the Buddha and his wife in a past life many lives before he became the historical Buddha and it basically said that their love was so strong that his wife would love and support him in multiple lives and eventually even let him completely go when the time was right. Real or myth? Don’t know. Yet, nice story where at least someone put some thought into it, knowing this would be seen as irresponsible and unloving/not compassionate action on the Buddha’s part. This story came from the sutras, not the author, just FYI.
The beauty of the Buddha story, in my opinion,is that the Buddha was a human being. He made mistakes and hard decisions, just like every other human being in the history of humans.He lived a life of extreme luxury and extreme poverty, and ultimately became a being who realized his own divinity on that perilous journey.It is difficult not to have compassion for the young Siddharta, whose thirst for ending the suffering of all beings led him to leave all that he loved and suffer for many years until he finally found his answers. The Buddha was Arhat and Bodhissatva. Had he not left his world behind, he would not have realized his own divinity. Both paths lead to the same end, and they are likely not the only two. We can walk in the direction that the Buddha points, but we do not need to sit under the same Boddhi tree to become unbound.Indeed, I believe he would encourage us to find our own.
nuts alive…your statement that the path of an Arhat and the Bodhisattva "lead to the same end" is just not true. An Arhat's enlightenment is not without karmic residue because they aspire to liberate only themselves. The bodhisattva vows to attain enlightenment only when all beings before them attain supreme enlightenment and that enlightenment is complete liberation without stain. This can be referenced in Kunzang Lamai Zhalung, or The Words of My Perfect Teacher, a commentary on Longchen Nyintik Ngondro written by Dza Patrul Rinpoche. This of course is not the only reference. There are bhumis of realization and then there are stainless complete realizations. Also the bodhisattva path inherent in Vajrayana is known as the quick path.
The Buddha was well aware that though we pray for all beings…those same beings have different acumen and needs. That the "story", as you put it, rings true for those who want to limit the Buddha's activity which is an also valid view. But it is also valid that on Vulture Peak he taught to the Mahayana sangha the Prajnaparamita Sutra. To King Indrabhuti he taught the Vajrayana, which is a bodhisattva imbued practice as are all Vajrayana, in the form of Ghuyasamvajra Tantra. If your statements, to which I disagree, regarding "the Buddha never taught Buddha Nature" or "the bodhisattva or bodhicitta is a recent creation" are your interpretation from your particular school of buddhism then please site the school. You make controversy where there needs not be, i.e., the "deadbeat dad" thing with no references.. When you do not site reference for the above statements or qualify them as particular doctrine then it comes off as your historical version and a little passive aggressive.
I hold a historical view and not a mythic one.
Is it possible that the Buddha gave some of his teachings to snake men to deliver to humanity later, at the proper time?
I guess so, but I prefer a skeptical view based on historical sources to a mythic view.
It seems more likely to me that the creators of these teachings had a view that for a Buddhist teaching to be valid it had to come from the Buddha himself, so they created a narrative that tied back to him. I don't agree with that view.
And I think one of the important things about Buddhism is that it welcomes common sense. Buddhist teachings don't necessarily expect us to accept them blindly or turn off our rational minds.
Does it matter? I think it does. We live in the modern world and rational people that could benefit from Buddhism could be turned off by stories about snake people, couldn't they?
The teachings of the Buddha are not accepted by everyone. They are not exclusive though. An individual can find authentic buddhist teaching if they choose to. It is not required to convince others nor is it imperative to explain teachings to those who are not serious about dharma. There is nothing mythic about the Prajnaparamita Sutra nor, for that matter, the entire collections of Kangyur and Tengyur. I appreciate skepticism whole heartedly. In your bio you state you practice Vajrayana. How do you reconcile bodhicitta and refuge and the practicing of the three samadhi without faith and devotion in something other than a story or your corporeal self? Would not vajrayana come under your historical linear scrutiny.? Finally, rational people "that could benefit from Buddhism could be turned off" is fine. America is doing it's best to change buddhism to be more accessible to the western mind…how can that happen if those who allegedly are doing the "changing" do not understand it?
That final sentiment is soooo important!
Buddha was a dead beat dad? He was THE best dad that ever lived! That’s like asking since fathers leave their children for war, are soldiers dead beat dads?
Buddha fought a war against death and won and came back to teach the world and his wife and son to beat death and suffering.
YOU and all nonBuddhist parents lazily enjoying their time with their kids while they are aging and in the hands of death are the true dead beat parents. I would rather have Lord Buddha as a father any day!
Look folks, to try to analyze a story, be it myth, fact or somewhere in-between that has been propagated for at least 2000 years outside of our own culture, and only recently (within a hundred years or so) translated and introduced for study through the lens of our own cultural karma and personal paradigms is folly.
The concept of a "deadbeat dad" is a uniquely western phenomenon, and with such terminology, a fairly modern one at that. Indian culture and thus culturally bound spirituality is VERY different from our own- in fact even in current day Indian men have VERY little to do with the rearing of their children, which is almost entirely the purview of mothers and grand mothers. In fact, in Vedic spirituality, the concept of family as we see it is non-existent. The highest calling for a male would be to become a spiritual seeker, in the Indian varna or caste system Brahmin or Priests are the highest rank, above even warriors and kings (Kshatriya).
In the scriptures of sanatana dharma (Hinduism) there is a system described in the varnashram wherein a couple are married and have children, and from then on the husband and wife progressively and purposefully work to detach from one another more and more so that the husband may do nothing less than completely leave the family life and become a mendicant (sanyassi) who completely dedicates his life to practicing austerity and traveling to teach the dharma, whilst the wife stays behind to help her own children (daughter) raise her children.
All is not as it seems- we have to step out of our own way and stop trying to interpret everything we find in other cultures through the lens of our own, as if in fact it was non-different. And that's not to say that we don't examine something and note, that hey yes, that is how it is in another culture and is not a problem for them and yet a direct transplant may not be compatible with our own culture, time and place.
The distinction between Arhat and Bodhisattva is not exactly correct- when the concept of a Bodhisattva arose, it was literally as one who put off final enlightenment (nirvana) and the escape from samsara (rebirth) in particular to be consistently reborn into this world to help all people attain to Buddhahood (by means of an arousing of bodhichitta) and then escaping him/herself. The concept of a Bodhisattva did not imply, or indeed have anything at all to do with one being householder, at all.
In our common vernacular today, we relate to having “Bodhisattva action” etc. which basically means self-less action, or action that puts the needs of others completely ahead of our own, as all action of a true Bodhisattva would be, but that is ALOT to live up to, that I doubt any of us (me included) approach with even remote consistency.
Bhikkhu Bodhi has taught (in summation from the Pali cannon) that Arhatship may be defined as the “attainment of nirvāṇa in this present life”, which is why it is written in mahayana literature that the purpose of our training is to “first wake up, and then instruct all beings (on the causes and conditions of awakening)”, therefore all Bodhisattva's are Arhats, and yet not all Arhats are Bodhisattva's. The paths are not distinct in the way that we in the west would like to think.
I believe it's important that we consistently evaluate own presuppositions (and even at times, motivations) for how we translate, literally or figuratively, the teachings of Buddhadharma to support our support our views. In the west, the most common thing I see, that skews understanding of the original concepts is our notion that all training is equal whether it be in robes in Thailand or on our couches- we like equality for all things and people, which is not innately bad of course, but none-the-less, if a factor concerning why concepts like Buddha nature has been so obscured, in that we dont need training outside of our daily lives, because we're already enlightened. Of course the latter is ALSO true, but so few of us are anything close to being an Arhat, let alone a Bodhisattva.
And further, the concept of Buddha Nature is not recent, it's an original teaching of Buddha Shakyamuni appearing Anguttara Nikaya (the fourth of five), in the sutra pitaka (sutra basket) of the Pali Cannon (tripitaka), where the concept appears as “prabhasvara chitta” or “luminous mind” (which always shining like the sun is only obstructed by passing clouds, which actually do not effect the sun or its shining). Thanissaro Bhikkhu translates the teaching from Pali as ."GROWMARK, FS, and other cooperatives across the U.S. will celebrate cooperative enterprise and the contributions cooperatives make to social and economic development this October as part of National Co-op Month.
In addition to National Co-op Month, the GROWMARK System is also celebrating its 85th anniversary in 2012, and participating in the year-long International Year of Cooperatives as designated by the United Nations.
The theme of Co-op Month, and the International Year of Cooperatives, is “Cooperative Enterprises Build a Better World,” which reflects the contributions cooperatives make to their members and communities.
Nearly 3,000 farmer cooperatives, like GROWMARK, FS, and grain member cooperatives, account for as many as 300,000 jobs worldwide and a total payroll of more than $8 billion.
Cooperatives operate under a set of guidelines known as the cooperative principles. Doing business with the values of voluntary and open membership, democratic member control, members’ economic participation, autonomy and independence, education, training and information, cooperation among cooperatives and concern for community sets cooperatives apart and inspires loyalty and commitment from their member owners.
More than 29,000 cooperatives operate in every sector of the economy and in every congressional district; Americans hold more than 350 million co-op memberships. Further, U.S. cooperatives generate 2 million jobs and make a substantial contribution to the U.S. economy with annual sales of $652 billion and possess assets of $3 trillion.
The GROWMARK System is comprised of FS and grain member cooperatives and subsidiaries, and employs more than 7,000 people who, in turn, serve more than 250,000 customers.

Too often we fall into a trap of labeling winners and losers in such things as labor negotiations. It's akin to a fight, yes, but it's not really a competition. The whole goal of labor talks should be to strike a fair deal to move forward, not beat your opponent.
Alas, that's not the way it works. After the 2004-05 lockout, there was no getting around the fact that the NHL was the big winner. The league wrestled away a ton of what it wanted -- chiefly, a salary cap -- from the players and the fans came back after an entire season was chopped. Even if you didn't want to characterize it in terms of winners and losers, it was very hard not to see the NHL scored big.
Now, after doing the same song and dance for the past few months in the NHL until a tentative deal was finally struck on Sunday morning just in time to save a season, the questions will arise again. Who won the lockout?
You could say the league did because it clawed back more money from the players while taking away some player rights. You could argue Donald Fehr and the players did, as Puck Daddy's Ryan Lambert did, because they stopped the NHL from completely pillaging and plundering the union like a ship full of pirates. Plus, they kept a lot of their contract rights and got a nice pension package to rally around.
Or you can call them both losers. Which they are.
It might not feel like it right at this moment as the euphoria of a deal being reached is still high, but it will likely be reality; this lockout will hurt the league. The damage the NHL has done to itself in the past few months is impressive in a way -- not in a good way, but still impressive. I think the NHL has come to terms with the fact that it will have backlash from fans and that will be reflected in the revenue streams, not that that makes it any better.
Life will go on for the league and the players and they will continue to be millionaires and billionaires but that doesn't qualify as a win for either, not in my book. Ultimately it will be up to the fans to decide if anybody won at all. If they don't come back or even just take too long coming back then no way can you say anybody did anything but lose.
The league had been building in popularity and revenue in recent years. The game while certainly still not perfect, appeared to be healthy. Almost as if they all couldn't stand the building success, both sides let things go down this route and get this far.
As each day went by the pie the owners and players share was going down instead of where it should have been going; up. That momentum has been stopped faster than a Zdeno Chara slap shot with this lockout and I'm not sure how long it will take for it to come back.
The owners won some of what they wanted in these concessionary negotiations and the players held onto or gained some of what they wanted. In the end both sides can and probably feel like they made it out pretty well all things considered.
That won't take away from the fact that it was a losing proposition for everybody from the beginning.

For a while, as a general rule of thumb, movies were approximately ninety minutes, give or take. It was relatively early in the short history of film that Erich von Stroheim broke with tradition and presented an eight hour movie -- the length of an entire work day. Not surprisingly, Greed (1924) was hacked to death by the front office into a more conventional film. There has always been a conflict in movies between money and artistic aspiration, though many happy compromises have been accomplished. The movies have a massive audience. They might not be taken too seriously as a whole, but they are influential. There was a time when a fair amount of ticket-buyers could be counted on to watch almost every movie. Those were the days of block booking. Even today, in a time when screens, big and small, are inundated with product, the industry can still shunt viewers into a finite, manageable amount of theaters, with only a handful of releases per week. It is hard not to admire the business, no matter what the titles, their form, or content. But once the audience is seated, how long should he or she be kept in that seat?
The short answer is that it does not matter. In the 1950s, long, prestigious films with intermissions and entr'actes evoked the notion that a presentation of great worth and merit was being attended. Then, on the opposite side of the coin, old films like The Return of Draw Egan (1916) were barely fifty minutes in length. True enough, silent film is more the domain of film historians and connoisseurs. I prefer Hell's Hinges as the quintessential W. S. Hart Western. Nevertheless, Egan is also a thrill. It could easily have been padded with an extra forty-five minutes of filler. Still, it is another example of an early, star-driven movie, albeit directed by same. Audiences could rely upon Hart to deliver the goods. In this case, they concern Draw Egan, an outlaw, posing as a marshal, who stumbles upon young Myrtle (Margery Wilson), who fills him with regret and penitential sorrow for not having followed the straight and narrow. What is more precious than gold? Well, now he knows.
Of course there are inter-titles. But they are supplemented by a theatrical form of film acting that almost makes them superfluous. Witnessing arguments without hearing words was as much a loss for film after the addition of sound as a gain. Check it out. Then there are facial expressions and various postures or poses that speak volumes. Not long ago, mostly in action films, dialogue was held to a minimum without adverse consequences. Of course, no films are absolutely silent. Without dialogue there was always music, sometimes accompanied by a live pianist. Today, filmmakers have to be very careful with music. It has the potential to totally distract the viewer/listener. It has to be good, but not that good.
Other early Westerns, such as Arizona Wooing (1915) with Tom Mix, are incredibly brief. It does have the distinction, however, of helping to introduce a standard theme in Westerns -- the unwanted sheepherder in cattle country. The Great Train Robbery (1903) is noteworthy probably only because it, too, was a first. It was also produced by Thomas A. Edison, who did not think too highly of movies. Naturally, his harsh judgment was somewhat premature. The Great Train Robbery was filmed in New Jersey. Perhaps its success inspired movie mavericks who followed the sun to California to re-locate the industry as a whole, then based in the East.2010 National Arbor Day Awards

NO EXPLOSION, Or NO FIRE Fresh, Full charged Prick through the sample battery with a nail having a diameter of 3mm and remain 2h. NO EXPLOSION, Or NO FIRE 5.Handling of Cells 5.1Consideration of strength of film package 1)Aluminium laminated film Easily damaged by sharp edge parts such as pins and needles, comparing with metalcan-cased LIB. 2).Sealed edge May be damaged by heat above 100°C. 5.2 Prohibition short circuit Never make short circuit cell. It generates very high current which causes heating of the cells and may cause electrolyte leakage, gassing or explosion that are very dangerous. The LIP tabs may be easily short-circuited by putting them on conductive surface. (Such outer short circuit may lead to heat generation and damage of the cell.) An appropriate circuitry with PCM shall be employed to protect accidental short circuit of the battery pack. 5.3.Mechanical shock LIP cells have less mechanical endurance than metal-can-cased LIB. Falling, hitting, bending, etc. may cause degradation of LIP characteristics. 5.4 Handling of tabs The LIP tabs are not exceedingly sturdy, especially the aluminium tabs for the terminal. Do not put much force on LIP tabs. (Aluminium tab may easily be torn off by shear force.) Do not bend tabs unnecessarily. 6.Notice for Designing Battery Pack 6.1Pack toughness Battery pack should have sufficient strength and the LIP cell inside should be protected from mechanical shocks. 6.2 Cell fixing The LIP cell should be fixed to the battery pack by its large surface area. No cell movement in the battery pack should be allowed. 6.3 Inside design No sharp edge components should be inside the pack containing the LIP cell. 6.4 Tab connection Ultrasonic welding is recommended for LIP tab connection method. Battery pack should be designed that shear force are not applied to the LIP tabs. 6.5 For mishaps Battery pack should be designed not to generate heat even when leakage occurs due to mishaps. 1) Isolate PCM (Protection Circuit Module) from leaked electrolyte as perfectly as possible. 2) Avoid narrow spacing between bare circuit patterns with different voltage. (Including around connector) 3) LIP battery should not have liquid from electrolyte, but in case If leaked electrolyte touches bare circuit patterns, higher potential terminal material may dissolve and precipitate at the lower potential terminal, and may cause short circuit. The design of the PCM must have this covered. 7.Notice for Assembling Battery Pack Shocks, high temperature, or contacts of sharp edge components should not be allowed in battery pack assembling process. 7.1 Do not solder directly to LIP tabs. Do not bring heated tools such as soldering Iron close to LIP cells. Temperature above 80°C may cause damage to the LIP cell and degrade its performances. 7.2.In case that the battery pack is fixed by ultrasonic welding, it is necessary not to apply too much ultrasonic welding power to LIP cell and electronic circuits such as PCM. Otherwise it may cause serious damage to the cells and electronic circuit. 8.Others 8.1.Cell connection Direct soldering of wire leads or devices to the cell is strictly prohibited. Lead tabs with pre-soldered wiring shall be spot welded to the cells. Direct soldering may cause damage of components, such as separator and insulator, by heat generation. 8.2.Prevention of short circuit within a battery pack Enough insulation layers between wiring and the cells shall be used to maintain extra safety protection. The battery pack shall be structured with no short circuit within the battery pack, which may cause generation of smoke or firing. 8.3.Prohibition of disassembly 1) Never disassemble the cells The disassembling may generate internal short circuit in the cell, which may cause gassing, fining, explosion, or other problems. 2) Electrolyte is harmful LIP battery should not have liquid from electrolyte flowing, but in case the electrolyte come into contact with the skin, or eyes, physicians shall flush the electrolyte immediately with fresh water and medical advice is to be sought. 8.4 Prohibition of dumping of cells into fire Never incinerate nor dispose the cells in fire. These may cause explosion of the cells, which is very dangerous and is prohibited. 8.5 Prohibition of cells immersion into liquid such as water The cells shall never be soaked with liquids such as water, seawater, drinks such as soft drinks, juices, coffee or others. 8.6 Battery cells replacement The battery replacement shall be done only by either cells supplier or device supplier and never be done by the user. 8.7 Prohibition of use of damaged cells The cells might be damaged during shipping by shock. If any abnormal features of the cells are found such as damages in a plastic envelop of the cell, deformation of the cell package, smelling of an electrolyte, an electrolyte leakage and others, the cells shall never be used any more. 1) 2) The Cells with a smell of the electrolyte or a leakage shall be placed away from fire to avoid firing or explosion. 9.Note: Any other items which are not covered in this specification shall be agreed by both parties. 10.

Lisa and Alex with their van, Peggy; Photograph by Jonas Seaman
Meet Lisa and Alex, the globe-trotting couple staging their own wedding over and over from South Africa to Singapore — and blogging about it all. We chatted with the couple for our fall issue of The Knot Weddings Magazine and here’s what they had to say.
The obvious question: Why get married in so many places?
Alex Pelling: We decided we were going to emigrate to Australia from England, and before we settled there we’d do some traveling. We decided to write a blog (2people1life.com) about unique places to get married around the world. In England it’s quite restrictive; you have to get married inside a registered building. Then we came up with the idea: How could we really write about this without experiencing these ceremonies firsthand? There was no great master plan.
You were newly engaged. So you just quit your jobs and set out on the road?
Alex: I had a small car-body-repair shop, and I sold that company. Lisa left her job; she’s in retail management. We flew to Canada, because it was one of the cheapest flights, and we had no idea what we were doing. We had just backpacks and ended up buying our camper van. We got to Vancouver and went south and drove all the way to Brazil. We’ve driven the entire length of the Americas over about 15 months and had 34 ceremonies — a wedding in almost every country. We had a wedding in Colorado and New York, and we did a voodoo wedding in Louisiana. Then, in Myrtle Beach, South Carolina, we did five weddings in five days, which was wild.
Lisa Gant: We did a James Bond wedding in Myrtle Beach, and I ended up doing most of the Bond things. All of a sudden, I was expected to jump off a high-speed boat into freezing water. I was so high on adrenaline.
Alex: Now we’re on the second leg. We shipped the van to England—she’s called Peggy, named after Lisa’s 93-year-old grandma. We plan to drive to Singapore, then ship the van to Australia, where we’ll end the trip and decide where our favorite place is and go back and finally get legally married for real.
You’re driving to Singapore?
Alex: We’ll go across Europe, then through Turkey, Iran, Pakistan, India, up to China and down to eastern Asia, then to Singapore. It should be interesting in a 25-year-old camper van, getting married all along the way.
Alex: We broke down a lot between Colombia and Peru. We got a faulty fuel pump, and the van would stop running at random. The scariest point was when we were driving on a road that had official signs warning of bandits. It’s a really cheap way to travel; our only real cost is fuel because we camp where we can and we cook in the van. We’re self-funded on this adventure; we didn’t win the lottery or anything.
What did your friends and family say about this grand plan?
Lisa: That we’d lost our minds. We had the idea only three weeks before we set off.
How much planning goes into each unofficial wedding?
Alex: It’s grown and developed. When we first set out, it was a new concept. Moving forward, I’ve got about 55 countries I’m in email contact with. In effect, I’m planning 55 weddings. We’re trying to dig up fun, forgotten cultural things. In Russia, the man has to complete a set of challenges to marry his bride. So we’re setting up all these physical and mental challenges—including [drinking] vodka — for the wedding day that I have to complete before marrying Lisa.
Lisa: He works forward, and I work backward. Once we’ve had the wedding, I stay in contact with everybody and handle the social media and blog. It’s such a joyful time, and everyone is so happy in the wedding industry. It’s a real bond.
Who’s footing the bill for your journey?
Alex: The only thing we pay for is the traveling. For the weddings, we have to rely on vendors and photographers to offer services in exchange for the publicity. We get a great experience, and we hope they have a great time too. It’s been a win-win experience. We’re not the normal bride and groom.
Lisa: We basically borrow everything. I’ve got one dress that I was given at the first wedding that lives rolled up in a bag under the bed. We call it the Marine of wedding dresses — it’s been underwater, on the beach, everything.
Alex: We had people asking if they could gift us money, but that’s not what this is about. We’re raising money for UNICEF, because it’s an international charity and its core mission is trying to give children a start in life. Anyone who donates through our registry is given the chance to be flown out to our final wedding, all expenses paid. That’s our personal commitment.

What have been some of the most memorable weddings so far?
Alex: We were affected most by the Peruvian Andean ceremony. You enter a garden
from different sides, and you come to a central point where there’s a shaman chanting and
a band playing string instruments. You hold the ceremony just as the sun is setting in
front of your eyes, so you can’t see anything. It’s an absolute wash of emotion. One of
our favorite venues was Colorado — outdoors, surrounded by nature, you just felt completely humbled. Also, Scotland. My father’s side is from Scotland, and we had the ceremony very close to the town where they’re from.
Lisa: I’m so excited about India, because I have a vague idea about how they
celebrate marriage. All the countries have completely surpassed anything that we could have imagined.
What’s been the hardest part?
Alex: Physically driving around the world in a camper van — it’s 16 feet by 6 feet — finding somewhere to park that’s safe enough and dealing with breakdowns are all challenging. We’ve got to hijack Wi-Fi all the time.
Lisa: We’re in the van and off the beaten path. We expected people to speak a bit of English, and we got to Mexico and not a word of English and we didn’t have a word of Spanish. You just have to muddle through, and it’s exhausting to ask for directions. We’re very good at sign language.

Do you ever get tired of being a bride and groom over and over?
Lisa: It’s different every time. In Chile, I got my hair cut and came out looking like a choirboy, and I cried. A lot of times we’re getting ready in the van, and we’ve just got a tiny mirror. There are times when I’m lucky and have a full team, attaching eyelashes and doing my hair.
Alex: We never once for a moment thought, I’ve had enough. We’re not having a white wedding in each country. We’re discovering and experiencing and learning new things
all the time, so it doesn’t get boring.
What kind of following have you attracted?
Lisa: In Brazil, we were filmed by a TV show called Fantástico that’s watched by 50 million to 60 million people on Sundays. While driving in Brazil—a lot of filming was in the van—someone was always beeping, waving their arms and shouting, “Fantástico!” Every fourth car was beeping at us. It was out-of-this-world weird.
Alex: It’s been an unexpected reward, meeting friends from all over the world. We’ll end this trip financially with nothing, but we’ll have a friend in every country.
Has traveling the world together changed your relationship?
Alex: I’m getting more emotional with each wedding—it’s like another benchmark. It’s making us very strong. We’re quite personable, so we can adapt to different environments and cultures quickly. After we left America and got back to England, everyone was saying we had an American accent. We seem to be able to zone into the local cultures. We’re both very adventurous. It won’t be until the end that we look back and say, “We’ve just been around the world.”
Any advice for a couple planning to get married abroad?
Lisa: Be prepared to go with the flow. Don’t expect anything to happen on time. If you don’t have any expectations, you’re always pleasantly surprised.
When does it all end?
Alex: Fall 2014. We’ll have the final wedding to plan and choose our favorite place. We don’t want to jump the gun and officially get married until we finish the adventure. We
just want the last ceremony to be a really high-energy, happy, intense experience for us.
And then what?
Alex: We’ll sit down in a dark room and relax. Then we’ll set up a new life together: That’s when the real adventure starts.

Grids set for final two days of action at Orlando Kart Center
Story by Florida Winter Tour
The competitors of the Rotax MAX Challenge portion of Formula Kart Productions’ Florida Winter Tour, presented by Ocala Gran Prix, were back in action today to set their qualifying times for this, the last weekend of racing in the 2014 Tour. To say, yet again, that the weather was spectacular and the conditions were perfect may actually be a bit of an understatement. To put it another way; today was further proof of why the Florida Winter Tour is known as “THE Winter Place to Be!”
F-TEAM FEATURE
Over the years, Formula Kart Productions has pioneered many advancements in how races are run and how they are seen. One such innovation is FWT LIVE!, the sport’s original live streaming broadcast with audience interactivity. One of the people responsible for making that happen is Michael Scott Wright, the producer of FWT LIVE!. Although Michael has been working with FWT LIVE! since its introduction in 2009, he has actually been with Formula Kart productions doing odd jobs for longer than he can remember.
As the nephew of Formula Kart Production’s owner Bill Wright, Michael says his memories of working kart racing go back to the first kart race Bill ever promoted which was held on the Driver’s Ed course at a local high school. As such, Michael has a great perspective on where the FWT has grown and evolved over the years. “Everything has grown,” he says of the Tour. “Not just the number of competitors, which is obvious. But, the number of people hired to put on these events.”
When not at the race track Michael works in office building maintenance back home in Tallahassee, FLA. For fun, he says he loves watching sports, especially if the Florida State University Seminoles are competing. “I love all types of sports,” he says, “but, if FSU is competing, I’m in. I don’t care if it’s basket weaving. If FSU is in it, I’ll cheer them on.” Loyalty like that is just one of Michael’s admirable qualities. As a popular member of the Formula Kart Production’s “Fun-Team”, Michael Scott Wright is an invaluable asset in keeping the Florida Winter Tour events running strong.
FEATURED DRIVERS
Those who have been watching the results for the Formula TaG Cadet and Mini MAX classes this year have seen the name d’Orlando a lot this year. Brothers Michael and Nicholas d’Orlando have had a great season by all accounts and are looking to build on their performances for the future. Last week Michael (12) wrapped up the Formula TaG Cadet championship of the FWT Formula Kart Racing Championship while younger brother Nicholas (10) was third.
The brothers, who hail from Westchester, New York, said they were attracted to racing from a young age and that their earliest memories were watching NASCAR on TV with their mom and dad. Around that time their father suped-up and electric car for them to drive around the yard and it wasn’t long until there was a path worn in the grass around their house. “They’d drive that until it broke, then I’d fix it and they’d drive it until it broke again,” he said. Knowing this couldn’t go on forever and wanting to find vehicles more suitable to the punishment these two youngsters could dish out, their mom did an internet search for karting and found nearby OaklandValleyRacePark. As a late birthday present they got their sons into a five-hour race school when they were five and six years old. One thing led to another and soon they had taken second and fourth in their very first race against some stiff competition.
For Michael, he says his favorite thing about racing is the competition and that he is really driven to win. Although he also enjoys basketball and cross country running, racing is a sport that fits him. Although, he did add that a lot of his friends back home just don’t understand racing and how tough it is. Perhaps someday he’ll get the opportunity to teach them.
Nicholas, the younger son who turns 11 next month, says his favorite part about karting is going fast and competing against other talented drivers. He was also sincere in adding that he really likes the friends he’s made in the sport through the last few years, and feels that is one of the best things karting has to offer. When time allows, Nicholas also likes playing basketball and football as well as lacrosse. Both brothers say they ultimately would like to race Formula One.
SH Racing sponsored Rotax DD2
The first group to set their qualifying times in each queue was the combined entrants in DD2 and DD2 Masters. The drivers of the fast DD2 machines hit the track for Sunday qualifying precisely on time and it would be perennial FWT frontrunner Nick Neri (USA) setting the pace with a lap of 51.385 seconds to set the fastest official lap of the day of any competitor. Second quickest for Sunday’s grid would be three-time Rotax World Champion Ben Cooper (UK/Canada) who was back in a DD2 after racing in Homestead and Ocala in Senior MAX.
In the afternoon session to set the grid in Saturday’s DD2 pre-final Nick Neri once again beat the best the field could offer with a lap of 51.641. Second fastest time would go to Nick’s Ocala Gran Prix teammate Jonathan Kotyk (USA) with a lap just 0.019 of a second adrift of Neri but 0.191 faster than Cooper in third.
Decal Zone sponsored DD2 Masters
The DD2 Masters were also hard at work setting their fast laps to qualify for this weekend’s races. In the morning session to set the grid for Sunday’s races Andreas Fonseca (Costa Rica) beat out Luis Schiavo (Venezuela) to claim top honors. However, Schiavo would come back in the afternoon’s session to claim Sunday’s Koene USA P1 Pole Award with a lap of 52.488 seconds. Joining Schiavo on the front row in Sunday’s DD2 Masters pre-final will be Derek Wang (USA) who timed in second quick just over a tenth of a second off Schiavo’s time.
PSL Karting sponsored Rotax Junior
In Junior MAX, Patricio O’Ward will be starting Saturday’s pre-final from the P1 pole position with point’s leader Pedro Cardoso (Brazil) alongside. This is good news for Pedro; however his main rival for the championship, Austin Garrison (USA), will be right behind him in third.
For Sunday’s pre-final, the P1 Pole Position award went to Canadian Gianfranco Mazzaferro who turned in a fast time of 54.075 to beat O’Ward by just 0.045 of a second. Starting third on Sunday’s Junior MAX grid is Austin Versteeg (USA), just ahead of Nick Brueckner (USA) who is starting fourth both days.
Rolison Performance Group sponsored MAX Masters
Luis Schiavo has been the top dog in MAX Masters all season long and today was no different. In the morning session to set Sunday’s grid Luis was 0.515 of a second faster than second quick Brian McHattie. In the afternoon session for Saturday’s pre-final grid Schiavo was again fastest with McHattie second. This time, the gap was 0.628 of a second.

With his amazing qualifying performances this season in both Masters classes, Luis Schiavo wrapped up the top honors for an adult driver in Koene USA’s P1 Pole Position Award contest for the 2014 Florida Winter Tour. In addition to the $200 cash award, Luis picked up enough P1 Pole Position stickers this year to cover just about anything he wants to, including himself.
AM Engines Rotax Mini MAX
As the 38-strong Mini MAX competitors took to the 0.700 mile Orlando Kart Center circuit for their qualifying sessions, no one could say with any certainty who would come out on top. The Florida Winter Tour has been known for years to have the world’s strongest and deepest fields in both Micro and Mini MAX, and this year is no exception.
In the end, Matthew Latifi (Canada) would come out on top for Saturday’s pre-final grid with a lap of 57.029 seconds while Sunday’s pre-final will be paced by Mathias Soler (Colombia). Emiliano Richards (Mexico) will start both days’ pre-finals from the outside of the front row as he looks to take home an FWT Palm.
GT7 Motorsport sponsored Micro MAX
Jeremy Fairbairn (USA) has been working very hard on his qualifying this year and it paid off as he set the fastest time for Saturday’s Micro MAX pre-final. Fairbairn’s fast lap of 1:00.564 led the way over Micro MAX point’s leader Reece Gold (USA) in second and Matheus Morgatto (Brazil) in third. With Gold and Morgatto one-two in points, this will be an interesting battle to watch onsite or on FWT LIVE!
Jak Crawford put everything together in the morning session to take Sunday’s Micro MAX pole position with a lap of 1:00.357 seconds. Behind Crawford in second and third are Sebastian Montoya (Colombia) and Reece Gold who are separated in the time standings by just 0.001 of a second.
MRP Motorsports sponsored Rotax Senior
The Florida Winter Tour Senior MAX field is stacked with talent from top to bottom. Leading the way for Saturday’s Senior MAX races will be 2009 Senior MAX World Champion Luke Varley (UK), who scorched the warm afternoon tarmac with a lap of 53.296 to take pole by just 0.004 over Jamaican Thomas Issa in second.
In the morning session to set Sunday’s Senior MAX pre-final grid, class point’s leader Oliver Askew (USA) took care of business by setting the Koene USA P1 Pole Position with a lap of 53.227. Second on Sunday’s grid will be Luke Varley with second-in-points Kyle Kirkwood (USA) just behind in third.
All indications are this is going to be a weekend nobody will want to miss. With plenty of sunshine to fill the days and magnificent viewing areas provided by the OrlandoKartCenter facility, this could be the best weekend all year to come out to the races. For those that can’t be here in person, you can simulate being here by setting up a tanning light and a small fan next to your computer and watching all the action as it happens on FWT LIVE!, the sports original interactive karting broadcast. And be sure to send shout outs to your favorite drivers and teams by emailing the FWT LIVE! announcers at live@FloridaWinterTour.com.kittenmaster

If you are a Twitter addict and are following Trent Reznor (Yes, it really is the one and only TR), you would be well aware that the official Nine Inch Nails application is making it's way onto the App Store any time now, for FREE.
You may be thinking "many bands have apps in the App Store", which may be true. But to be honest, they are pretty poor attempts. If anyone can get a iPhone application done the right way, it would be Reznor.

Edit/Copy Release Notes
The text area below allows the project release notes to be edited and copied to another document.Details of out-of-court deal confidential
Filmmaker Robert Lantos has settled a legal dispute with Stephen Vizinczey, author of “In Praise of Older Women,” the film adaptation of which established Lantos as a producer on the international scene.According to Canadian media reports, Lantos and Stephen Vizinczey settled a year-old breach-of-contract suit out of court for an undisclosed sum late last week. Vizinczey sold the rights to his autobiographical 1965 novel “In Praise of Older Women: The Amorous Recollections of Andras Varda,” about a young Hungarian man tutored in eros by women in their 30s and 40s, to RSL Prods., a company founded by Lantos and lawyer Stephen Roth, for C$42,500 plus “6% of gross earnings,” as detailed in a contract Vizinczey reportedly penned himself. The film raised eyebrows for its then-racy tone at its 1978 preem at the Festival of Festivals (which later became the Toronto International Film Festival). Lantos has gone on to produce many more films, including “Joshua Then and Now,” “The Sweet Hereafter,” “Black Robe,” “Crash” (the one directed by David Cronenberg) and the Oscar-nommed “Being Julia.” Vizinczey had always believed that the 1978 film was a fiscal flop, until in a featurette included on the 2004 DVD release, Lantos revealed in an interview that “Older Women,” which starring Tom Berenger and Karen Black, had grossed close to $20 million worldwide. Vizinczey was further chagrined that he was not given credit in the DVD release notes. He filed a breach-of-contract suit in an Ontario court last September alleging that he is owed at least $231,000. The settlement reportedly promises also to give Vizinczey due credit on the DVD’s notes and suggests the two could collaborate again in future.Family Studies: As we often note on this blog, one factor behind the decline of marriage is the declining availability of stable, well-paying work for men who have not graduated from college.

Alexander Volokh at Reason Foundation: Contracting with a private corporation to deliver an activity may alter the labor-management relations regime and the ADA regime but not the RLUIPA regime. The constitutional state-action regime may be unchanged with respect to the population served, but may be radically different with respect to hiring and firing decisions. What other regimes are altered may also depend on what conditions the contractor committed to fulfill in its contract. How, then, do we define “public” vs. “private,” “government” vs. “private sector,” “instrumentality of government” vs. “mere contractor”, “state actor” vs. “private actor”? We don’t. Each of these terms is a shorthand designating a broad set of attributes, and contracting out is all about exploring the limits of these concepts. For any given statute or constitutional provision, different rules might be appropriate in different contexts.

Did Bryant and his Los Angeles Lakers get in the heads of Denver players and coaches, who were yapping, crying dirty pool, complaining to the refs and trying to regain their equilibrium after a 128-114 loss?
Put it this way: Bryant did more than beat the Nuggets. He performed brain-salad surgery on them.
Can Denver recover? Or was this the beginning of yet another sad, quick end for the Nuggets in the playoffs?
"They've got to see us again. They've got to see us for six more games. We ain't going nowhere," Denver forward Carmelo Anthony vowed Sunday.
Talking trash, throwing elbows and messing with minds, Bryant slyly insisted his gamesmanship was nothing more than "vintage '80s basketball."
Does that make Kobe the new bad boy of the NBA?
To fold, spindle and manipulate Denver in any or all the ways in which he was accused, Bryant said "I'd have to be Neo from 'The Matrix.' "
Bryant is a dirty player, if you believe Nuggets guard Anthony Carter, who was punished with a technical foul in the third quarter for pushing the L.A. star under the basket.
Carter lost his composure after being scraped by a finger in the eye, which appeared to be an unintentional act by Bryant when the two players got tangled. Not so, insisted Carter, who explained: "It's been happening every game we play them. I always get hit in my face with an elbow or something, and nothing has ever been done about it."
The temporary meltdown by Carter proved to be the emotional turning point of Game 1, as the Lakers went on a roll while the Nuggets went into a funk.
"It was a bad call," said Denver coach George Karl, risking the wrath of the league office, which could fine him.
Rather than complain, what Karl should probably do is consider removing Carter from the starting lineup in favor of J.R. Smith, who along with fellow reserve Linas Kleiza gives Denver the firepower and athleticism if the Nuggets are to have any hope of winning this series in a shootout.
In the arena where patrons who love L.A. chant "M-V-P" every time Bryant prepares to shoot a free throw, fans serenaded Anthony with a loud chorus of "D-U-I" at every opportunity, dissing the young Nuggets forward for recently being arrested in Colorado on suspicion of drunken driving.
"It was funny to me," Anthony said of the sophomoric heckling you would expect to hear on a college campus. "I was able to block it out."
But here's the biggest difference between Kobe and Melo, and why we know one of these NBA single-name superstars has more growing to do before anybody sees Anthony step out of Bryant's shadow.
Make Bryant mad, and you're begging for him to make it rain anvils on your skull, which maybe explains why the Nuggets looked so dizzy as the L.A. superstar scored all but four of his 32 points after halftime and transformed what had been a tense afternoon into the laughter of a sunny Southern California day.
Get Anthony frustrated and he will go sit alone on the floor of the baseline, which is where you could find a moping Melo late in the third quarter, when the Lakers outscored Denver by the embarrassing count of 39-22.
But Bryant was not finished. He jawed with Nuggets forward Kenyon Martin during a break in the action until the refs demanded silence. "That's basketball. He's not going to talk to me with no response," Martin said.
The dominant personality of Bryant so frustrated Denver that guard Allen Iverson took early leave from the blowout, getting slapped with two technical fouls for a verbal outburst a little more than two minutes before the final buzzer. "I deserved to get thrown out," Iverson said.
The Nuggets now have two choices.
Allow Bryant to play them for patsies.
Or shut him up.

by Joe Meloni/CHN Staff Writer
BOSTON Entering their fourth season at Boston University, Terrier coach Jack Parker usually knows what to expect from his players.
With Chris Connolly this season, he has a shifty, creative forward that can play in every situation. Kieran Millan, the BU goaltender, was clearly ready for his final chance to prove himself as one of the premier netminders in the country.
Corey Trivino, though, had always been difficult to figure exactly. On one end of the ice, he's been among the Terriers' best defensive forwards since his career began in 2009. Offensively, there have been a few stretches that told Parker Trivino possessed the skills necessary to take over game. However, Trivino's had a few others that made Parker question whether or not he'd ever get that point.
At the moment, Trivino's in one of those stretches — the good ones. Through three games, he's scored three goals and assisted on three others, while leading units on both special teams for the 2-1-0 Terriers. Maybe last year, Parker would remain skeptical of Trivino's success. Not this season, though. Parker's convinced Trivino will maintain this level of play through the season — so are Trivino's teammates.
The reason isn't particularly difficult to pinpoint, either. He has to. There are no more seasons remaining to define his legacy at BU. No more chances at leading his team to the glory he followed Matt Gilroy to as a freshman.
"He's one of our top players this year, and I think he knows that," junior winger Alex Chiasson said. "It's his last season here. If he wants to move on to the next level, he has to have a pretty big year. Guys look up to him. He works hard in practice. He worked hard all summer. His skills and his speed are just over everyone else's."
"I think he's just feeling that it's time for him to take over a little bit," Parker said. "He's a senior, and he wants to get as much as ice time."
Trivino seems to agree with the assessment of both Chiasson and Parker.
"It's my last year. I want to go out with a bang," Trivino said. "I was recruited to BU to score goals. Hopefully, throughout the year, I can continue to do what I'm doing."
Consistent contributions without the puck earn young players plaudits from their coaches and more ice time in critical moments. For the Terriers to get to their ultimate goal this season — a couple games in Tampa next spring — Trivino needs to continue making a difference when the puck is on his stick. And he can do that in any number of ways. Against New Hampshire last Friday, a good read and a beautiful redirection of a pass from Connolly resulted in his first goal.
Saturday night, his goal was hardly pretty, but the result of experience and relentless effort. With the Terriers killing a penalty, Millan collected the puck at his goal line and fired it down the ice. Denver goaltender Adam Murray played the puck with a defenseman to his right, waiting for the pass. Murray hesitated briefly, and Trivino turned it on.
"I saw Kieran had the puck behind the net. I started skating, because I knew he was going to ice it. I started scooting down, and I saw their goalie had it had it," Trivino said. "I just wanted pressure him, so he would have to pass it. Thankfully, he just kind of bobbled it. I took it and wrapped it into the net."
Hardly his prettiest goal as a Terrier, but it counts just the same. That effort, paired with the skills that earned him a place at BU to begin with, will likely be a deciding factor in the eventual success of the Terriers this season.
Playing with Connolly and sophomore Sahir Gill has Trivino at his best. His coach is impressed, and his teammates are following. They're convinced he'll maintain his level of play throughout the season.
So is Trivino. He is a senior, after all. He really doesn't have much of a choice.Comcast Trials Bring PVR Race to a Head
Comcast has undisclosed holdings in both companies.
The trials represent a major step for the PVR companies as both seek the ultimate goal of their respective technologies being directly interfaced with cable set-top boxes. Comcast's decision of which company it aligns with will either boost or delay that goal.
"The products are slightly different, and the underlying technologies are slightly different, so that may result in a better consumer experience with one rather than the other," said Andy Adiss, vice president of marketing and new products at Comcast Cable Communications Inc., Philadelphia. "There is a consumer side and an operational side as well. We want to learn about this category and be able to respond competitively if we have to."
For the trials, ReplayTV will cover Comcast subscribers in Burlington County, NJ, and TiVo will be offered to those in nearby Cherry Hill, NJ.
Subscribers in the area will receive an additional set-top box -- either ReplayTV or TiVo -- that will be hooked directly into their cable set-top. They would then receive services just as they would receive their basic cable, with free installation, no deposit and no long-term commitment.
Comcast will provide installation and instruction on using the boxes, and will handle customer billing concerns. The respective PVRs will handle technical questions and will be able to track the use of their boxes through the separate phone-based Internet connection that the set-tops use. The PVRs will also conduct extensive interviews with subscribers who purchase the plans.
"We are looking at a number of things," said Jim Hollingsworth, senior vice president of sales and marketing at ReplayTV Inc., Mountain View, CA. "What is the customer satisfaction with the experience overall? Do they feel that it substantially enhances the value of their cable subscription by being able to more easily find, capture and watch on their own schedule additional programming that they are paying for?
"And from the cable operator standpoint, what effect does this have on the subscriber insofar as usability and satisfaction with pay-per-view and premium services? The final question is: Does the addition of this digital video recorder significantly enhance cable services?"
The only difference in the trials is price. TiVo will be offered for $18.95 a month, while ReplayTV will go for $11.95 monthly. The price differences reflect the retail price and the companies' overall business model when it comes to cable operator distribution. ReplayTV sees itself as a free service, while TiVo believes customers should have an additional charge apart from the fee for the set-top.
At retail, ReplayTV's 30-hour hard drive goes for approximately $550 and up but with no fee for service. The company also has a 20-hour drive available for about $400. TiVo's 30-hour drive sells for around $400, with service fees ranging from $9.95 monthly to $99.95 yearly to a lifetime service fee of $199.95.
Adiss said the price points were separately negotiated with each PVR and each "accurately represents the type of customer proposition that we would ultimately be able to offer, based on what the likely business models that the two respective players will put on the table."
This new direction in business model is the third for the two PVR companies. TiVo is sold as a stand-alone or bundled with Sony, Phillips, DirecTV and, come next year, AOLTV. TiVo is also part of a video-on-demand arrangement with DirecTV and BlockBuster that will debut next year. ReplayTV is distributed as a stand-alone or bundled with the Panasonic ShowStopper set-top. ReplayTV is also involved in a VOD trial itself -- with Time Warner in Los Angeles, which was the first time a cable operator and a PVR joined to market their wares to consumers together.
Comcast will market the boxes using commercial airtime and direct mail, while both TiVo and ReplayTV said they have worked with Comcast in designing the promotions, but will only go as far as to perhaps play their respective infomercials in the designated areas.
Adiss said Comcast's marketing position is one of simply alerting their customers that they can have the PVR service if they want it.
"Core to our strategy, in our trials we are not actively marketing to build a category; we are going to let TiVo and Replay do that," Adiss said. "Our strategy to the customer is, if this is something you want, before you think about getting it anywhere else, call us. And the reasons are threefold -- you can lease it from us and you don't have to buy a box that will be obsolete in six months; two, we'll come to your house, install it, make sure it works with all your other devices and we'll make it simple for you; and three, there will be some other promotional offer related to it -- for example, a free month of a premium channel -- which we are putting the final touches on now."
Both TiVo and ReplayTV have accepted that Comcast has created a line in the sand, and that once that line is crossed, it could spell trouble for the losing side.
Edward Lichty, director of business development at TiVo Inc., San Jose, CA, calls the dual trials "suboptimal" but added, "We are happy to compete with them and feel good about our ability to compete with them."
ReplayTV's Hollingsworth, however, had some words about TiVo describing the trials as a "deployment" in a press release.
"TiVo calls it a deployment, but a deployment indicates that there is a business deal beyond the trial, and if you talk to Comcast, you'll find out that that isn't necessarily accurate. So, at the end of the day, we are doing simultaneous market tests, and we will see what the results are."
"It's probably easy to say that any cable operator is going to make a decision, and probably work with one company or the other on real integration and rollout; that's typically how these things work. I fully believe that Comcast is going to evaluate both of these trials side by side, and that's going to help them make a decision on how to move forward," said Hollingsworth.
Meanwhile, there are additional concerns surrounding the PVRs, such as their fast-forward technologies being unfriendly to advertisers.
"That's a hornet's nest, and we are steering clear of that right now," Adiss said. "We just fundamentally want to understand if this is something the consumers will really be engaged with. Our gut and some research that we have does indicates that [fast-forwarding] is pretty high on the list in terms of consumer appeal, relative to other technologies. But that's further down the path, and we're not there yet.""The olsr.org OLSR daemon is an implementation of the Optimized Link State Routing protocol.

By Lavinia Spalding
In the mid-'90s, South Korea became known as a country where one could earn a small fortune teaching English and it quickly became a hot spot for ESL instructors. In late 1997, however, the Asian economic crisis caused a mass exodus of Westerners, leaving Korea desperate for English education but unable to afford it. The country has not yet fully recovered, but it is well on its way. A renewed, almost palpable, optimism has spread through Korea
Hogwans, or private institutes, the easiest places to find work, have earned a reputation for being on the shady side. However, if you look carefully, plenty of reputable ones do exist and hiring packages have become increasingly attractive. A 1-year contract typically includes roundtrip airfare to Korea, a relatively competitive salary (the equivalent of $1,500-$1,700 per month for a 25- to 30-hour work week), housing, two weeks' paid vacation, and severance pay equal to one month's salary upon completion of your contract.
Do Your Homework
The basic rule for securing a good teaching position in Korea is to do your homework. Begin with Dave's ESL Café and ESL Worldwide, where you can sift through countless job advertisements. At, you'll find a wealth of general information on Korea. These sites also offer invaluable links to numerous other sites.
Pusanweb.com is a rich source of practical info. For answers to specific questions, join a discussion board on any Korea-related site.
Whatever you do, don't jump at the first job offer you receive. It's wise to search the Internet for blacklists (sometimes called greylists) that warn against schools best avoided. Before deciding to accept a job offer, try to contact another Westerner employed at the school so you can get the inside scoop.
Finally, remember that there's no lack of job opportunities-so if a school sounds even slightly sketchy, take a pass. Once you've signed a contract, getting out of it and changing jobs can be a colossal pain in the neck.
The Logistics
The traditional method of finding work in Korea is to secure employment in advance, but many teachers now head to Korea first and find a job after they arrive. A 3-month tourist visa is available to Americans and a 6-month visa to Canadians. Immigration officers who might wonder why you have no return ticket are usually mollified with an explanation that you plan to travel on to Japan via ferry.
Once in Korea, finding accommodations is painless and fairly cheap. Most people take a room at a yogwan (motel). These are ubiquitous and cost approximately $15-$30 a night. Finding temporary teaching work while searching for a permanent position isn't difficult. Short-term institute jobs abound and are most easily located on the Internet or by word of mouth.
The most significant benefit of arriving in Korea jobless is that you have the luxury of looking around for the position that offers the best teaching and living conditions. You'll be able to see the school and accommodations (insist on this), negotiate with the director, and consult other teachers at the school before signing a contract. Once you are hired, most institute directors will pay your way to Japan so you can obtain a work visa.
The Pay-Offs
While most people who move to Korea are enticed by the possibility of financial gain (saving $10,000 to $20,000 a year), that's certainly not the only reason to come here. Koreans are exceptionally warm and generous. Students are polite and respectful. And the culture is fascinating. One of the greatest rewards of life in Korea is the opportunity-around virtually every corner-to take classes and acquire knowledge. Koreans, particularly those living in smaller cities and towns outside of Seoul, welcome any chance to share their culture with foreigners. This means teachers can study everything from Korean language and cooking to meditation, traditional drumming, and martial arts at a truly minimal charge, in exchange for English lessons, or even for free.
Studying Tae Kwon Do or another martial art in Korea might cost you no more than $30 a month for intensive daily classes. Institutes and restaurants in most towns and cities offer lessons in Asian and international cooking. One such institute is La Cuisine in Seoul. On the other hand, convincing a Korean friend or student to teach you to prepare your favorite local dishes usually takes little more than a request. Volunteer groups across the country, offer Korean classes to foreigners at no charge. The Busan Buddhist mission busanmission@orgio.net offers free classes every other Sunday. Foreigners and Koreans are taught to make green tea, perform mask dances, meditate, fashion lotus lanterns, and learn a variety of other cultural crafts and traditions.
Korea, like all other developing countries, can of course be a challenging place to live from day to day: cities are crowded, traffic tends to be nightmarish, and, at first, Koreans might seem somewhat brusque or pushy. But once you've lived here a while and learned to navigate the cultural differences, the greatest challenge often lies in staying only a year or two. Countless expatriates fall so deeply in love with Korea that they wind up making it their permanent home.

-->-- ''Anime/CodeGeass:'' ''[[ The Abridged Series]]''
A common device whereby a character, usually an OrdinaryHighSchoolStudent, is thrust into piloting a machine that they wouldn't be allowed anywhere near under normal circumstances due to a disaster or enemy attack.
Our hero might have an assload of [[BeginnersLuck raw talent]], secretly be a ReplacementGoldfish, part of the next [[EvolutionaryLevels stage in Human evolution]] or just [[IKnowMortalKombat play videogames a lot]], but whatever the reason, he now has to pilot the thing in the middle of a battle (where he is now a prime target) [[DieOrFly just to get out of the situation alive]]. And boy, does he!
Of course, the problem afterwards is how to ''keep'' them in the machine after the crisis has passed. It could be that all the normal pilots were wearing [[RedShirt Red Shirts]] that day, or the fact that the machine is kind of an EmpathicWeapon, and can only key itself to its first pilot (or just ''likes'' him better), but for the time being, he's stuck in the cockpit of an engine of destruction, whether he [[JumpedAtTheCall wants to]] or [[RefusalOfTheCall not]].
It may work in RealLife if lucky or desperate enough, since a lot of machines' operation is designed to be intuitive: controls of a tank (or engineering vehicle based on a tank) from the T-54/T-55 series, for example, are very similar to a truck (except for steering levers instead of a wheel, and even they are intuitive (pull the lever for the corresponding direction, leave other untouched)). The long and demanding training of a machine operator is not needed to drive the machine, but to drive it in a '''safe''' and economically viable manner. In a desperate last stand, [[TheLastDance safety is the last thing people would think about]].
Widely used in {{Mecha Show}}s. A SubTrope of PowersInTheFirstEpisode.
----
!!Examples:
[[foldercontrol]]
[[folder: Anime and Manga]]
* The ''{{Mazinger}}'' series:
** ''Anime/MazingerZ'': The first HumongousMecha anime used this trope showed it [[UnbuiltTrope in a more realistic way than later shows]]. Kouji Kabuto, the first HumongousMecha pilot, knew absolutely nothing about piloting a giant robot -or any manner of robot, really- and in the first few episodes [[SubvertedTrope it shows]]. Mazinger went on a rampage the first time he activated it because he kept punching random buttons as he tried to learn controling the damned thing (in the original manga he almost destroyed one whole city; and in the anime he almost gets his little brother killed), and he got beaten in his first battles. Sayaka and her father did their best to teach him quickly, but until then he only survived due to Mazinger's impressive weaponry and sturdy body armor... and Kouji soon revealed he was a quick-thinker that could come up with new strategies on the fly.
** It was subverted with Sayaka, who was taught to pilot Aphrodita A.
** And averted by Tetsuya and Jun from ''Anime/GreatMazinger'', that were trained for years.
** On the other hand, Duke -and Hikaru- from ''Anime/UFORoboGrendizer'' play it straight. Maria, on the other hand, was trained to pilot the [[MidSeasonUpgrade.
** It happens again in ''Anime/{{Mazinkaiser}}'' - when Kouji finds and takes up the titular mecha, it goes on a rampage. It isn't until episode four that Kouji's actually shown controlling it without it falling on its ass.
* ''Manga/GetterRobo'' plays it mostly straight. However, in a manga chapter, Ryoma literally shoved a shell-shocked Hayato into the cockpit, placed a helmet-like contraption on his head and told it was a computer would help him to drive the jet. Hayato -who was still shellshocked after seeing a humanoid lizard eating his friends and a giant, flying dinosaur bringing down his school-, tried to protest he did not want to doing this. Ryoma did not care.
** In ''Getter Robo Go'', Go and Sho try to hijack a {{Robeast}} in the first arc. However, Sho does not manage keep it under control, not matter what she does. Finally go lost his patience and blew the controls up, thinking it would stop it. [[NiceJobBreakingItHero Unfortunately the only thing he managed was the monster went completely and unstoppably berserker]].
** ''New Getter Robo'' makes a ShoutOut with this in Hayato's introduction episode.
* ''Anime/KotetsuJeeg'' subverts it: Since Hiroshi transforms into Jeeg, he did not need prior training.
* ''Anime/{{Raideen}}'' subverts the trope. Raideen was a sentient mecha led Akira into his cockpit by telepathy. When Akira woke up from his trance and saw he was inside a HumongousMecha and surrounded by monsters, the first thing he did was to scream: "LET ME OUT OF HERE!". Raideen calmed him down stating he could read minds, so the only thing Akira needed to do was think about what he wanted Raideen to do.
* The ''Anime/RobotRomanceTrilogy'':
** ''Anime/CombattlerV'' ''Anime/VoltesV'': When the Voltes team was roughly shoved into their vehicles, Kenichi protested they did not knew how driving them. Then his mother reminded him flatly they HAD got training to pilot aircrafts.
** ''Anime/{{Daimos}}'' justified the trope: Kazuya was a space pilot but nobody had taught him to pilot Daimos before shoving him into the cockpit. However, his MotionCaptureMecha was piloted through a mental interface, allowing him piloting it and using his martial arts to fight (and still in the first battle he needed being informed of the weapons of Daimos).
* ''Anime/{{Zambot3}}'' justifies it: Kappei gets roughly shoved into the cockpit of Zambot Ace by his grandparents and big brother. Before he can ask "What the heck am I supposed to do now?" he realizes he just ''knows'' how handling it... and his family informs him they taught him to pilot it through SleepLearning.
* ''Franchise/{{Gundam}}'':
** More or less happens with Amuro Ray in ''Anime/MobileSuitGundam''... who later is revealed to be a "Newtype". Of course, in addition to being a tech geek to the point he could build his own RobotBuddy (Haro), [[HandWave he got a hold of the Gundam's manual just before he even saw the robot.]] And the thing was largely designed by his father. --Still, in his first battle he could barely move it, and won mostly because its advanced armor stood up to everything the mook suit pounded it with.
** And Kamille Bidan in ''Anime/MobileSuitZetaGundam'' since he, off screen, reviewed the data on the Gundam Mk.2 by hacking his dad's computer... though Kamile, TeenGenius that he is, does ''invent his own MidSeasonUpgrade''. It is some what justified because he is also the champion of the Junior Mobile Suit competition, which involves designing, building and piloting a smaller version mobile suit in a race that can attack your opponents, and the standard control of those ARE made by the same companies that manufacture cockpits for the military Mobile Suits.
** Subverted by Judau Ashta in ''Anime/MobileSuitGundamZZ'', who is initially ''horrible'' at piloting, to the point that he can barely get the Zeta Gundam to stand up straight. It takes a few episodes of practice before he's reliably able to pilot with any skill at all. Even then, it's suggested that the only reason he was able to learn quickly was 1. he's a Newtype and 2. he's been making a living working in a junkyard, which involves some basic worker-suit piloting.
** And Banagher Links in ''[[Anime/MobileSuitGundamUnicorn Gundam Unicorn]]'', who fought his first battle essentially [[SuperpoweredEvilSide on autopilot]].
*** [[LampshadeHanging Lampshaded]] in episode 5, when Bright Noa points out that this happened to all the Gundam pilots who came before Banagher.
*** Also subverted for the fact that he actually got a license in piloting Junior Mobile Suits and his father, who is the person behind the syndicate Anaheim Electronics that manufactures literally everything from radios to space colony, before handing him the SuperPrototype, told him the controls are pretty much the same as a Junior Mobile Suit that he just piloted earlier in show.
** Uso Evin in ''Anime/MobileSuitVictoryGundam'' gets the excuse that he's played with MS simulators as a kid, so he has a fairly good idea how a Mobile Suit works from the beginning.
** Garrod Ran in ''Anime/AfterWarGundamX'' has no justifications at all. At the beginning of the series he can fly a Mobile Suit, and it's simply implied to be a skill he picked up growing up in a Post-Apocalyptic wasteland.
** Loran Cehack in ''Anime/TurnAGundam'' plays with the trope: he came upon the Turn A accidentally, as is usual, but he was already trained in MS piloting by the Moonrace. He is also shown studying the Turn A's manual in great detail over the next few episodes.
** Tobia Arronax of ''CrossboneGundam'' manages to subvert this - when SpacePirates attack, he jumps into a grunt MS, gets defeated but explicitly not killed, and joins up with the Crossbone Vanguard despite two completely separate chances to walk away. And he's still not a terribly competent pilot until halfway through the second volume. Of course, it's subverted another way in that when he takes that first MS, he tells a soldier who protests that he's an engineering student with a license to pilot construction MS, and at the very least he'll be another gun out there.
** And Kira Yamato in ''GundamSEED'', the Series basically being a retooled update of the original makes this a necessity.
*** SEED does try to justify it a little. Kira, like Amuro, is a tech geek. Unlike Amuro, he's a bit older and actually studying robotics in college. That, and he puts his [[RapidFireTyping Improbable Hacking Skills]] to good use, AND had been helping his professor in writing the very machine code for the Mobile Suit he is piloting without his own knowledge.
*** Also, Kira had to re-configure the Strikes OS in order to get the mech to operate properly ([[Awesome/MobileSuitGundamSEED in the middle of a fight, no less]]). Being a Coordinator, he put in a system that was too complex for unaltered humans to use, so for a long time he was the only person on board the Archangel who ''could'' operate it.
** Averted in ''GundamSEEDAstray'' as Lowe Guele had NO idea how to pilot the Red Frame, thus left a lot of it to his new computer, 8, until he could properly handle it.
** Shinn Asuka in ''GundamSEEDDestiny'', who is a Kamille's {{Expy}} of sorts, is actually a trained pilot when the series starts. Not to mention the pilots in ''GundamWing'' and ''{{Gundam 00}}''...
*** Speaking of {{Gundam 00}}, this trope played straight with [[spoiler: [[TagAlongKid Saji Crossroad]]]] when [[spoiler: he was asked by Ian to pilot the 0-Raiser and deliver it to [[TheHero Setsuna]] so they can [[CombiningMecha combine]].]] He becomes its permanent pilot afterward.
** In Tomino's own Gundam novels Amuro is a trained, if young, military pilot, and is a lot less whiny than in the series.
** Subverted in GundamAge along the lines of Zeta Gundam, the first protagonist had a hand in designing the mobile suit and knows how it works.
*** And completely averted during the second generation. Flit deliberately leaves the Gundam where Asem can find it because he had always intended to give it to him.
*** Inverted in the third generation when Flit literally ''brings'' the cockpit to his grandson, Kio, when Kio's home town is under attack. The cockpit then becomes a jet which attaches to the rest of the Gundam.
* ''Anime/HeavyMetalLGaim'' -another YoshiyukiTomino series- averted the tropes, though: Nearly everyone is a trained pilot. Those that aren't are quickly removed from the picture.
* Shinji Ikari from ''Anime/NeonGenesisEvangelion''. Initially, he refuses to pilot it owing to his sense of self-survival, but agrees once he sees that Rei is in no condition to even [[YouCanBarelyStand stand on her own]]. Of course with no training, combat experience or even a clue where the power button is, Shinji basically gets his ass kicked in his first Angel fight until his Eva takes over and beats it up. (However, given the nature of what Evangelions are, it wasn't a matter of luck that Shinji was designated a pilot.)
** Averted with the other pilots. Asuka was selected from age six and trained for years to earn her title. Rei was literally ''built'' to pilot the Evangelion. Kaworu's pretty much perfect for the job. If only he [[spoiler: wasn't an Angel]]. And Mari? She's just nuts.
* Akito Tenkawa in ''MartianSuccessorNadesico''. He was trying to run for it and the mecha was a handy getaway vehicle; everyone else thought he was volunteering to draw the enemy's attention.
* Renton in ''EurekaSeven'' ends up almost literally falling into the cockpit of the Nirvash typeZERO while delivering a crucial part to it. He then proceeds to unlock its true potential and earn his place as co-pilot.
** Although really, the cockpit falls on Renton (the Nirvash crashes into his house) before he takes the leap that puts him in the driver's seat.
* He also does jack squat for quite some time. His first solo sortie in the Nirvash is in episode 15 or something.
* A variant of this trope is used in ''LightNovel/FullMetalPanic'': Sousuke is already a highly skilled HumongousMecha pilot when he is forced to pilot the experimental BlackBox Arbalest mecha, though he does return to using his normal mech type for a bit eventually he is forced into becoming the Arbalest's designated driver when it turns out the machine's AI calibrated itself to him and can't be reset.
* ''{{Macross}}'' offers a deconstruction, as Hikaru Ichijo (a.k.a. Rick Hunter of ''{{Robotech}}''), a stunt-flying prodigy, ends up in the cockpit of a Transforming HumongousMecha/Fighter Jet just when the day needs saving. He proceeds to stumble around and cause a great deal of property damage, because while civilian display team flying is fairly applicable to flying a Jet Fighter, it has ''nothing'' to do with robot piloting skills. A crash course from a mentor keeps him from falling into buildings, but he only becomes competent after enlisting in the army and spending a reasonable amount of time in training.
* Alto, and later with considerably less success to Sheryl, in ''MacrossFrontier''. Apparently the fact that Alto (and later, Sheryl) was going to piloting school might have been supposed to justify this, but this is the same as someone who's only partially completed real life flight school Falling Into The Cockpit of the military's latest top-secret fighter! Sheryl's attempt has more realistic results.
** When Alto tries to get to fly it a second time Ozma punches him in the face for his insolence and has him thrown out. Its only afterwards that Ozma gives him a chance, but he has to go through the [[TrainingFromHell proper channels first.]]
* In ''Anime/CodeGeass'', Suzaku is the only soldier available to pilot the new Lancelot Knightmare Frame because he's at base recovering from [[OnlyAFleshWound a point-blank bullet wound]] while everyone else is out [[KickTheDog slaughtering civilians]]. It later turns out that he's the best match for the mecha.
** The dialog implies that Suzaku's aptitude was tested when he first enlisted, but since only native Britannians are allowed to pilot Knightmares his high marks meant bupkis. He does mention simulator training at one point, [[FridgeLogic raising the question as to why they would have Honorary Britannians go through KMF simulator training if they weren't allowed to pilot one]].
** An oft-overlooked example are the Japanese rebels; it's overtly stated that, until a certain point in the series, they don't have any Knightmare Frames of their own, only ones that they've stolen from the Britannians. Given how large the things are, what opportunity would they have had to practice with them enough to be good enough to go toe-to-toe with the military? Particularly {{egregious}} in Kallen's case, since her group operate in a city; at least the JLF could conceivably have found a quiet patch of countryside. Not only that, but she later manages to master the new [=KFs=] sent to the Black Knights by Kyouto and Rakshata with extraordinary speed and ease...
*** Her group does manage to get hold of a single Glasgow - the older military-use KMF type - and apparently they all try it out. Kallen, of course, is the best, and gets to pilot it in their operation.
** Lelouch is a close one. He's not amazing or anything, but he handles a Sutherland quite well on his first try, only briefly admitting that it's not as easy as it seems. He's had some minor training, using the test type Ganymede, but that didn't have even half of the features of the modern Sutherland, like the weapon/grappling cable, and the ''gun'', which he uses to great effect in his first deployment. Admittedly, he doesn't even remotely fall in, but he never gets actual training, either.
*** And, to be perfectly blunt, Lelouch is still a pretty crappy pilot. He may be a notch above the common run of {{Mooks}}, but against trained pilots he's practically a Mook himself. His most impressive feats only happen because his personal machine was made specifically to play to his strengths; it doesn't fight with guns or swords like regular Knightmares, but instead uses a scattering laser weapon and BeehiveBarrier that have to be controlled manually, something only someone with Lelouch's intelligence and quick wits could accomplish.
* ''Franchise/{{Zoids}}'':
** The main protagonist in ''Anime/ZoidsNewCentury'' (the first series broadcast in America) Bit Cloud fits this trope to a T. Not only is he thrust into piloting the Liger Zero in the first episode, with no piloting experience beforehand, but the Liger also refuses to allow anyone else to pilot it.
** In ''Anime/ZoidsChaoticCentury'', the first series in Japan and the UK, Van comes across an abandoned Shield Liger in the desert, but would not have been able to pilot it were it not for [[ABoyAndHisX his robot companion]] [[MacGuffin Zeke's]] help. Unlike many examples of this trope, he keeps piloting it not because others make him, or because only he can, but because the [[HumongousMecha Zoid]] belongs to him, having previously been abandoned.
** In ''Anime/ZoidsGenesis'', a shockwave causes protagonist Ruuji Familon to LITERALLY fall into the Murasame Liger's cockpit when he first pilots it. Ruuji continues to pilot the Liger to save his village and to eventually seek out a generator mechanic.
* Simon of ''Anime/TengenToppaGurrenLagann'' ends up having to pilot the Lagann almost immediately after he finds it, despite his protests. Fortunately for him, it's an EmpathicWeapon of sorts. And '''''[[HotBlooded HOT BLOOD]]''''' accomplishes everything in TTGL.
** ''ALL'' HotBlooded characters end up being able to pilot a Gunman eventually, usually after only a little bit of fumbling. Rossiu manages to learn in the brief time he's in Gurren's cockpit and Kamina's away during the HotSpringsEpisode.
** Gunmen are explicitly stated to have ridiculously intuitive controls. It's said that one just has to "do what feels natural" and the machine practically pilots itself, which does provide some [[JustifiedTrope Justification]].
* In keeping with its love of mecha tropes, ''MagicalGirlLyricalNanoha'' does this as well--Nanoha comes into possession of [[SpellMyNameWithAnS Raging/Raising]] Heart completely by chance. The third season later implies that ''trained professionals'' with similar weapons don't even come close to what Nanoha managed to do immediately.
** They can't match her POWER, but as Chrono made clear, many likely outmatched her SKILL until she underwent her own brand of TrainingFromHell. The difference between latent-talent/power and hard-work practice/skill is one of the minor themes of the series.
* Ayato from ''RahXephon'' has this happen.[[spoiler: Sort-of. He thinks he's an OrdinaryHighSchoolStudent, but the mech was actually made for him and he was guided to it mid-battle on purpose.]]
* Hibiki Tokai in ''{{Vandread}}'' is a partial subversion: He was trying to steal the mecha in the first place.
** Also he made his mech at the Factory, and knows which part is what so he knows, in theory, how to pilot it.
* Hokuto and Ginga come near the eponymous mecha of ''GearFighterDendoh'' during an enemy attack, while the assigned pilots are still on their way; predictably, they end up inside.
** In fact, the mech itself picks them up and deposits them in the cockpit.
* ''SoukouNoStrain'' also features Sara Werec, another trained field mecha pilot, getting into an experimental machine in the middle of a battle. Her ''superiors'' have no idea that she's ever piloted a Strain before.
* In ''[[Anime/SuperDimensionCenturyOrguss Orguss 02]]'', HumongousMecha mechanic Lean is forced to pilot in order to escape an ambush of the cargo plane he was in. This trope is subverted in the following episode; he's brought into the organization that pilots Decimators, but told flat-out that only the best of the best are even considered as pilots. He does fall back in in the last episodes, where he's the best pilot available to stop an OmnicidalManiac -- even though he's ''blind'' at the time...
* ''Anime/FafnerInTheAzureDeadAggressor'' is a perfect example of this. In the first episode Kazuki has to pilot Fafner despite the fact that up to that point he was not even aware that such a mecha existed.
** It's later [[JustifiedTrope explained]] that he was made (literally) to pilot the mecha, along with the rest of his generation.
* In ''Anime/DualParallelTroubleAdventure,'' Kazuki Yotsuga only climbed into that mecha cockpit to rescue its injured pilot... then it slammed shut on him, and he had no other choice...
* Subverted in ''Anime/FangOfTheSunDougram'' - the good guys take the protagonist to their secret base where they keep the eponymous HumongousMecha and offer to let him pilot it. Suddenly, enemies attack, and just as our hero gets ready to invoke this trope, the Dougram is snatched away by a cargo helicopter.
* Gram River sort of has this happen to him in ''MarsDaybreak'': It actually came out to ''catch'' him, and given that they were underwater at the time, it was more of a ''sinking'' than falling.
* Subverted in ''CandidateForGoddess''. In very first episode main hero of series finds 5 most powerful mechas during a battle and literally falls into the cockpit of one of them. Yet, even when MECH ITSELF was asking him to pilot it and join the battle, he refused because he didn't know anything about piloting.
* In ''ZettaiMutekiRaijinOh''. [[TheHero Jin]], [[TheLancer Asuka]], and [[TheHeart Kouji]] [[spoiler:(and later [[TheChick Maria]], but only through remote control)]] become mech pilots only because they happened to be there when the Mech's previous owner was dying. Then it's played literally as OnceAnEpisode, during the school's massive TransformationSequence, the said pilots are literally ''thrown'' into the cockpit before launch.
* Averted in ''BreakBlade''. Rygart was a gifted student in the military academy who couldn't operate a golem because he is an Unsorcerer; he suddenly has to pilot an ancient Golem he can use.
* Hirono Keita from ''{{Betterman}}''. Not only fits the trope to a T; he almost literally falls into the cockpit of the mecha, and happens to be a Dual Type, able to pilot it.
* Seina Yamada of ''TenchiMuyoGXP'' is actually ''tossed'' into the cockpit, mostly because the people who did so realized the ''god'' (the machine he was tossed into) had chosen him. And mostly because he accidentally dragged a bunch of pirates in with him and they wanted him to get rid of them.
* In ''Anime/IdolmasterXenoglossia'', Haruka Amami falls into an iDOL's open cockpit after being tossed high into the air by the same iDOL. Later we find that Haruka had passed a blind test on her aptitude as a potential iDOL Master, however, even the ones who set up the test were surprised that the iDOL had a seemingly arbitrary attraction to Haruka, when it had not even respond to a trained and experienced Master.
* Non-mecha example: in ''Anime/FutureGPXCyberFormula'', during a delivery of Asurada GSX to the Fujioka circuit, the machine is attacked, and Hayato Kazami ends up driving it to get out of the mess. Unfortunately, Asurada locks Hayato's driving data, so he has to enter the Fujioka race since Sugo's present driver can't even get the GSX to move and he quit the team because of that.
* The first experience of piloting [[SuperRobot Gaiking]] that [[IdiotHero Daiya]] has in ''Anime/GaikingLegendOfDaikuMaryu'' s initiated by {{Robeast}} Daiku Maryu ''eating him''. The head then detached and flew off, [[CombiningMecha combining with head and leg parts]] to form Gaiking, the Daiku Maryu's head forming the torso and head, with the cockpit inside, where Daiya had been "eaten" into. [[JustifiedTrope It's explained that]] Daiya's the only one who can pilot the thing in any case, since Gaiking will only respond to his signature [[AppliedPhlebotinum Flame Energy]].

[[folder: Comic Books]]
* Creator/KurtBusiek's short-lived ''{{Shockrockets}}'' begins with this trope.
* In ''Franchise/{{Tintin}}: [[Recap/TintinTheBlackIsland The Black Island]]'' Thompson and Thomson commandeer an airplane mechanic to fly a plane to chase after Tintin. The untrained pilot performs a lot of accidental aerobatics, and ends up winning a prize in an aviation contest.
[[/folder]]
[[folder: Fan Works]]
* The ''Manga/{{Bleach}}'' fanfic ''[[ The Shining Dark]]'' does this with Ichigo fittingly. {{Justified|Trope}}, as Ichigo is already trained and has a strong knack for it.
* ''Fanfic/TheSecondTry'': A hilarious example. In chapter 2 Asuka wants to drive a car for first time in spite of she has never got driving lessons. Shinji thinks it is not a good idea, but she argues if she is able to drive a HumongousMecha, she is able to drive a car. Shortly after she finds out that... nope. She is not able. At least she did not crash the car and them...
* In the first FanFic/MarissaPicard fanfic, ''Enterprized'', the kids' shuttle pilot (named [[RedShirt Ensign Throwaway]]) dies, leaving the kids to pilot the shuttle to safety. The kid chosen to take the controls was the one who had the most experience with the shuttle simulator, which is kind of like selecting your pilot based on who's played Microsoft Flight Simulator the most. Later fanfics have the Kids Crew taking over for entire incapacitated ''starship crews.''
[[/folder]]
[[folder:Film]]
* Anakin Skywalker in ''ThePhantomMenace''.
-->''Qui-Gon told me to [[ExactWords stay in this cockpit]], so that's what I'm gonna do!''
** And it sort of happens to Luke in ''[[ANewHope Star Wars]]''. Both only had extremely limited experience flying civilian craft before ending up flying starfighters at decisive battles in their respective conflicts.
*** In Luke's case, there's an ExpandedUniverse HandWave / AllThereInTheManual statement that an X-Wing's controls aren't that different from the [[ Incom T-16 Skyhopper]], a very fast, small three-winged civilian airspeeder that's parked in his garage in ANewHope. In the original trilogy novels, he's been grounded from it for reckless flying. He'd damaged the hull, which was why he took the landspeeder when looking for R2. You see him playing with a small model when he's talking to the two droids for the first time. When he talks of "tagging womp rats", he's referring to aerial target practice.
**** "Sir, Luke's the best bush pilot in the outer-rim territories." Film canon. Perhaps Biggs is exaggerating a bit to help Luke get in the cockpit, but this statement strongly implies that he's flown more than landspeeders.
**** [[ Incom]] is also the same corporation that designed the X-Wing, so it makes sense that there would be some similarities.
**** A different manual, in addition (this being the NPR Radio Drama version of ANH, the same one where Wedge chews him out for that {{Dissimile}}) actually has a scene where the Alliance dumps Luke in an X-Wing simulator for a bit of crash course training. He does [[ImprobablePilotingSkills spectacularly well]]; Biggs says they threw a fleet at him and he only died twice. Which, I suppose, counts as falling into the ''simulator'' cockpit...
**** Actually averted: in both Anakin's and Luke's cases, their ''[[AppliedPhlebotinum sensitivity to the Force]]'' gave them an edge over other pilots not so attuned.
** Also, in the expanded universe, Maarek Stele (the player character of ''TIEFighter'') was originally a mechanic who was in a fighter (testing it), and happened to be in a position to save a high-ranking officer from attack.
*** And Anakin ''Solo'' gets to use the EmpathicWeapon variant, the hyperspace repulsors of Centerpoint Station. Are we sensing a pattern here?
* Spencer from ''Film/StarKid'' literally got shoved into the cockpit of the intelligent, armor plated, alien super suit Cy.
* In ''FlightOfTheNavigator'', a little boy that had been TouchedByVorlons is recruited to pilot a UFO.
** Technically, the UFO only needs the starmap stored in the boy's brain, as its own navigational database was wiped by an electrical shock.
* In ''Film/{{Airplane}}'', Ted Striker is a former Air Force fighter pilot with a [[ShellShockedVeteran severe neurosis]] about flying. When he musters his courage to get on a jet airliner to chase after his girlfriend, he turns out to be the only one aboard with any flying experience after the pilots all succumb to food poisoning. It doesn't help that the airline officer assigned to talk him down happens to have been his commander during The War.
* In ''SnakesOnAPlane'', Troy is the one with the most experience to land the plane - [[IKnowMortalKombat through video games]].
** Thankfully, he gets some help from air traffic control.
* In the 1980 ''Film/FlashGordon'' film, Flash has to take over over the controls of a plane when the pilots are sucked through the windshield (or maybe [[DisintegratorRay disintegrated]]) by Emperor Ming.
** Not to mention that he also pilots a Jetbike and the huge "Ajax" cruiser later in the film without much trouble.
* In ''TheLastStarfighter'', Alex is EverybodysDeadDave coerced into piloting the last fighting starship in the peace-loving part of the universe.
** He's not actually the pilot, he's the gunner.
** And the videogame/recruiting device counts as a training simulator to a certain extent: he's already familiar with the controls and with the enemy ships he's engaging, and he was selected precisely ''because'' he was the best player on Earth at a game designed deliberately to prepare him for the experience.
* Happens twice in ''Film/IndependenceDay'':
** Civilian pilots are recruited and given a few hours of lectures before taking to the sky in modern fighter jets without any actual flight simulations and manage to help win a battle against the aliens.
** WillSmith's character pilots the crashed UFO to dock with the mothership. Despite not knowing about aliens until two days prior, he defends himself as the best choice because he's "seen these things in action" and therefore knows of their maneuvering capabilities.
* Somewhat averted in Film/TheMatrix because when Trinity needs to fly a helicopter but doesn't know how to, she gets the knowledge uploaded to her brain in an instant.
** Played straight in Revolutions. Captain Mifune is mortally wounded and tells Kid to take control of his APU and keep fighting. When Kid says he didn't complete the training program, Mifune smiles and says "neither did I".
* In ''Film/BattlefieldEarth'', the tribal humans manage to pilot modern fighter jets after practising in simulators for a few days, whereupon they fight and defeat the supposedly "advanced" Psychlos.
** To be fair, Psychlos only conquered Earth because of their teleportation technology, which they used to instantly cover the planet with nerve gas. That's really the only way human resistance could only have lasted a few minutes. The Psychlo aircraft are not dedicated fighters, nor are the Psychlos on the planet dedicated soldiers. Most of them are miners.
* In ''Turbulence'', a serial killer gets loose aboard a nearly-empty 747 in midair, incapacitating the entire flight crew except for one stewardess-- er, flight attendant. She gets talked down through a landing at LAX by an airline pilot on the ground. Fortunately for her, this is a modern 747 with all the automated bells and whistles, and landing procedures basically consist of pressing the "fly me to LAX" button followed by the "land me" button.

[[folder:Literature]]
* The ''{{Temeraire}}'' series has Captain Lawrence in a similar situation with a dragon, minus the initial battle. He's simply bonded to one of the rarest dragons in the world. A lot of the conflict is derived from various authority figures trying to get Temeraire to let someone else be his partner.
* 'May Day' has a light aircraft pilot attempting to fly a damaged supersonic airliner after an accidental missile strike. With most of the passengers in a [[FromBadToWorse near-zombie state]] due to oxygen deprivation.
* Happens literally to Ford in ''MostlyHarmless'', after he jumps off a skyscraper to see what happens.
[[/folder]]
[[folder:Live Action TV]]
* The climactic scene of the ''Series/{{Chuck}}'' episode "Chuck vs. the Helicopter".
* This is more or less how Ziggy becomes Ranger Green in ''Series/PowerRangersRPM''.
** Really, most of the Power Rangers in general fall into this category. It IS a show that depends on HumongousMecha to win the day, after all...
* Played with in ''Series/SuperRobotRedBaron'': Kenichiro Kurenai does teach his brother Ken about Red Baron's functions and how to use them, during a test run. But then, [[MechaMook Troy]] [[MonsterOfTheWeek Horse]] shows up and attacks Red Baron, knocking it down. Despite this, Kenichiro continues his instructions so that Ken can do a proper counterattack.
* Averted in the ''Series/StarTrekDeepSpaceNine'' episode "Valiant", which feels like a {{Deconstruction}} of the ''Franchise/StarWars''-style plot; an advanced warship falls into the hands of a bunch of inexperienced but brave cadets, whose charismatic leader decides to try and destroy the Dominion's new super-battleship with an experimental weapon. They fail, their ship is blown up, and then the Dominion plays SinkTheLifeboats with the escape pods.
* Played for laughs in a ''GilligansIsland'' episode where Gilligan attempts an escape from the island using a WorldWarTwo Japanese mini-sub. Although he has small-craft handling experience, Gilligan spends a good deal of time circling around the lagoon because the controls of the submarine were unfamiliar to him and labeled in Japanese. Specifically, he blames the compass, but [[FridgeLogic a compass will still point toward magnetic north no matter what language the card is printed in]].
* Deconstructed in a ''Series/BuckRogersInTheTwentyFifthCentury'' episode where a teenager steals a SpaceFighter but quickly ends up in over his head and unable to return to base. Buck talks him through the procedure and compliments him on getting that far...[[RealityEnsues then turns the kid over to his parents for punishment]].
* The PilotMovie of ''{{Series/JAG}}'' plays with this trope. Harm was a Tomcat driver before he was a Navy lawyer, but was forced to change careers due to an undiagnosed eye problem that resulted in a plane crash. He [[BackInTheSaddle goes for a ride-along]] during a combat recon mission. The pilot is wounded, and Harm has to take the stick. Unusually for the trope, Harm doesn't have to deal with any bad guys, but he has his hands full with an in-flight emergency and [[ComingInHot landing a complicated aircraft he hasn't been in for five years.]]

[[folder: Tabletop Games]]
* In the ''TabletopGame/{{Warhammer 40000}}'' comic ''Titan'', Princepts cadet Hekate is thrust into commanding the massive Warlord Titan Imperious Dictatio when the previous Princeps he was assigned to observe unexpectedly dies in the middle of a battle.
* R. Talsorian Games' ''{{Mekton}} Zeta'' is a roleplaying game geared to the HumongousMecha genre, and this trope may (and probably will) be invoked at least ''once'' in any given campaign, no matter the setting.
* Generally soundly averted in ''{{TabletopGame/BattleTech}}'' in that it takes literally years to train somebody to be a good [=MechWarrior=] -- even just to cadet level. The [[BattleTechExpandedUniverse novel]] ''Hearts of Chaos'' sees super-scout and [=BattleMech=] hunter Cassie Suthorn invoke this trope twice (once via hijack, once borrowing a friend's ''Atlas''), and despite everything she knows about 'Mechs from the outside and having taken some lessons in between the two incidents she barely manages to get the machines to do anything useful at all.

[[folder: Video Games]]
* In the [[SuperRobot Super]] route of ''VideoGame/SuperRobotWarsAlpha'', your character gets into the Grungust Type 2 when the plane carrying it crashes into his or her school during a fight between MazingerZ and the MonsterOfTheWeek. On the [[RealRobot Real route]], your character is a young pilot in the military...who also falls into the cockpit of an experimental mech that happened to be at the base you're assigned to during an enemy attack; this time being the Huckebein Mk II and the Titans. As it turns out, the whole thing [[ThePlan was a set-up]] by Ingram.
** Ingram pulls the same trick on Ryusei with the Gespenst Type-TT in ''VideoGame/SuperRobotWarsOriginalGeneration''. Despite Ryusei's lack of training ([[IKnowMortalKombat aside from his skills playing Burning PT]]) Ingram calls the idea that Ryusei wouldn't be able to win in that situation "nonsense".
** In ''VideoGame/SuperRobotWarsJudgment'', playing as Touya will have the unit you picked crash into a school building near him, complete with UnwantedHarem while MazingerZ and its female sidekick defend the school from enemies.
*** It's also [[LampshadeHanging lampshaded]] by Gai early on, who says that anyone that gets a mech that way is destined for greatness.
** The [[VideoGame/SuperRobotWarsZ Z series]] on the other hand has so far [[AvertedTrope Averted this]] with its {{Original|Character}}s. Setsuko Ohara, while TheRookie, is still a trained pilot, Rand Travis was piloting Gunleon for years, and Crowe is a retired veteran ([[spoiler: and was a member of an [[AcePilot Elite Black Ops unit]] at that]]).
* Nearly every protagonist in the ''VideoGame/ZoneOfTheEnders'' series, with the exception of Radium in ''IDOLO''. It helps that the Orbital Frames typically have some sort of AI to help.
** James Links in ''Dolores, i'' is a bit of a subversion: The mecha in question was actually being sent to him in the first place.
*** James Links IS an experienced veteran, while the AI (Dolores) has personality of an [[KidHero innocent child]]
** Dingo Egret is actually an experienced pilot by the time he finds Jehuty
*** Dingo however was asked if he would like a refresher VR training program since it was several years since he piloted a military grade frame (He was using LEVs until he found Jehuty)
* Played straight in the rare, yet extremely enjoyable 'Mech sections of ''[[VideoGame/FirstEncounterAssaultRecon FEAR 2]]''. A possible [[LampshadeHanging Lampshade]] in that the manual specifies that only a highly trained 'Mech pilot should even think about touching the controls. Michael Beckett is the furthest thing from a pilot. Michael Beckett in a 'Mech is all but unstoppable.
* In ''VideoGame/{{Xenogears}}'', [[TraumaInducedAmnesia Amnesiac]] Hero Fei stumbles into the cockpit of a downed mech when his DoomedHometown gets caught in the crossfire. Fortunately, he was a skilled pilot before losing his memory. Unfortunately, his forgotten self [[EnemyWithin isn't a very nice guy]]. And by [[ThePlan purest coincidence]], the mech he happens to crawl into is a special kind that only he can unlock the true potential of. [[spoiler: He ends up accidentally wiping out what's left of the town, and the surviving villagers [[DeconstructedTrope blame him for trying to use the thing when he didn't know how]], causing Fei to stop using the mech out of disgust until a few scenes later.]]
* The concept is used in the video game ''SteelBattalion'', where your character is told he will have many months of simulator training before being allowed near the cockpit of a VT. True to form, the enemy attack, the character gets in the cockpit with the manual (the game is trying to tell you to do the same) and begins mission number 0. Actually [[NintendoHard much harder]] than [[MobileSuitGundam Amuro]] makes it look...
* In US version, the hero of ''VideoGame/BlasterMaster'' just finds a machine lying around there.
* In ProfessorLaytonAndTheUnwoundFuture, the professor must do this at the end.
* A variation occurs in ''AceCombat 5''. Archer ''is'' a trained pilot...more or less. He's been through flight school, anyway, he just...hasn't completed his qualifications training yet when his base comes under attack and he climbs into a spare fighter. He ends up being a member of Wardog ([[spoiler: later Razgriz]]) squadron, ''the'' most accomplished aces in the game.
* Technically, most of your NPC crew in ''VideoGame/MassEffect3''. The game starts with Shepard bugging out as the Reapers invade Earth, with everyone aboard the Alliance-impounded Normandy forced to come along for the ride. They're all professionals in one field or another (Anderson was planning to use the ship as his mobile command center), so they make the best of it. Shuttle pilot Steve Cortez is officially your logistics guy, and shares armory duty with Vega - you're just lucky he's ''also'' a damn good pilot. Considering Vega's piloting skills include crashing into other shuttles - deliberately as a case of RammingAlwaysWorks and after Shepard furiously demands that someone take the enemy shuttle down, admittedly - you're lucky to have Cortez.
* This happens to the Federation players in ''VideoGame/StarTrekOnline''. On your first Voyage, you get attacked by a Klingon fleet. The captain has you run minor tasks, so he can get himself captured and executed, but not before promoting you to the captain. You then proceed to annihilate the attacking fleet with just a bit of help.
* In the iOS game ''VideoGame/TheWarOfEustrath'' powerful [[HumongousMecha GEARs]] have their own persona and are able to choose to their rider. When country girl finds herself drawn into an enemy base by the GEAR Tianerx she hides in Tianerx to avoid detection by the Kradionese soldiers she synchronizes with Tianerx and ends up becoming its pilot. In time she develops into one of the game's best characters.
** In the same game Robin ends up piloting Zeeyown similarly. Even though Zeeyown doesn't have its own persona, Robin has an ability that allows him to communicate directly with the elemental forces that drive [=GEARs=]. Even though his decision to pilot Zeeyown onto the battlefield was intentional he ends up in the cockpit in the first place because the elements respond to his desire to help Tiana.
* ''VideoGame/FarCry3'': A character who has only recently qualified as a fixed wing plane pilot has to fly a helicopter with no preparation, while being shot at. It is said that any landing you can walk away from is a good landing, and that if you can use the plane again it's a bonus. He gets the bonus.

* Grif in ''Machinima/RedVsBlue'' has never had any special vehicle training, as far as we know, yet somehow he always manages to end up as the designated driver. While he's great with a jeep, unlike a lot of examples he's not necessarily a ''good'' driver of some of the more exotic vehicles he drives... like the Pelican he crashes.

* Played with in ''WesternAnimation/MegasXLR'': Coop finds the Megas in a junkyard after it's flung into the past and becomes the hero and pilot... but only because the cockpit was beyond repair to the point where Coop rebuilt it out of a CoolCar and several [[IKnowMortalKombat jury-rigged video game systems]], which means that Coop is literally the only one who can pilot it.
** Played straight by Kiva, who lands in and learns to drive a car in all of about five seconds, rationalizing that such a simple machine should be easy if Coop could pilot Megas.
* ''Animation/CubixRobotsForEveryone'': In the first season finale, four of the Doctor K's five personal mechs are revealed to have cockpits and manual overrides (up til then, they just followed his orders). The kid heroes end up piloting them when they sneak into his base to [[spoiler: retrieve the damaged Cubix.]] This comes in very handy when K [[spoiler: ''transforms the entire base'' into the skyscraper-sized Kulminator.]]

* During the battle of Stalingrad, which had a tank production facility present, several of the T-34s were being rolled out ''directly'' into combat. Their crews consisted of literally anyone that could work the things, including the very factory workers who ''built them.''
* On the Western Front, M4 Sherman casualties mounted so much at times that tank commanders would replace lost crew members with anyone they could find from the infantry units they worked with. The results varied, but in a pinch, anyone really can operate a tank[[note]]This was due to the fact that at the time tanks drove just like tractors and there were a lot of farm boys that had grown up driving tractors. Manning the guns took some work, but it was better than having empty tanks.[[/note]]
* A non vehicular example goes to [[ Doris Miller]]. To clarify, Miller was given very little, if any training on ANY fire arm prior to the attack on Pearl Harbor, and his battle station was no where near a gun or turret. However, he still found his way to a .50cal Heavy Machine Gun, and manned that gun until it ran out of ammo. ToraToraTora and PearlHarbor both show that he shot down atleast a one or two aircraft, but considering how many other sailors were shooting at them at the time, it's unsure if he managed to hit anything. However, he still goes down in history as someone doing the right thing, even when the times would not allow him to do so (for instance, a black man manning a gun station that was officially supposed to be manned by a white guy).

so many Marines were paying for modern tactical replacements.”
In the M12’s place, the Corps will now field the Blackhawks SERPA Level 2 Tactical Holster. Deliveries of new holsters “will begin in November, with 27,455 of them distributed by April, according to officials with Marine Corps Systems Command in Quantico, Va. That’s one for every 9mm M9 pistol in the Marine Corps’ inventory. The pistols are typically carried in combat by officers and Marines whose jobs require them to work in confined spaces.”
That choice, though, has raised some concerns. As Marine Corps Times explained, “while the SERPA is more advanced than the M12 nylon holster it will replace, the product has been faulted by some firearm enthusiasts for what they say is a dangerous design flaw that can enable ‘trigger hooking.’
In some cases, if a shooter isn’t careful when drawing the pistol, the trigger finger can slip onto the trigger and squeeze off a round. And that has caused injuries.”
“I would think you would have the same worry regardless of what holster you are using,” said Matt Rice, a Blackhawk spokesman. “With the draw stroke that Blackhawk works on, the finger is supposed to go outside of the trigger guard and line up exactly right when the pistol comes out of the holster.”

What happened to the use of proper carry techniques? The little thing called safety engaged? The issue with this holster is NOT whe used with the issue Beretta, rather with the so called “safe trigger” equipped firearms such as the Glock, that lack an external safety. If a round is discharged on drawing an M9, the firearm is NOT being carried in the proper state to begin with (this is where the term “locked and loaded” comes from). Come on Brian, you should know better than that. Stop making us “cheese heads” look ignorant!----- 6th Grade Analogies-----

I'm in favor of him moving to NT...he can help mentor Jean-Francois and between the two of 'em, they should be able to hold the point. Moving him to NT also enables Aldon Smith to be on the field more...and that's going to be a good thing. Justin Smith has needed a true bookend DE and now he has one. They still have Evans and Tukuafu for depth/mentoring Aldon Smith. Franklin disappointed me last season...I also don't think he's worth the kind of money he's seeking. So, I think it's time to turn the page and move on without him.
- I agree with Franklin being somewhat disappointing last season, and am also not excited about paying him the type of contract he will demand.
- This bolded part confuses me. Do you then think Aldon will be bulked up and inserted in as the LDE? I thought the plan for him was stay around 270 and be our rush LB?
I like the idea of Sopoaga and RJF spending time on the field together at NT/LDE. We can have RayMac rotate at LDE, but we still would need some quality depth at NT or DE, depending on the particular rotation/involvement of the others mentioned.
- That was a good article with Sopo and I also liked the quotes.
If we can have J. Smith, Soap. and Ray Mac on the field at the same time with Aldoron able to line up whenever and P Willy roaming around, there will be matchup nightmares for the other offense. Aldoron shines inside and out. He could be the real deal and a one of a kind stud. Hopefully he pans out. The guy has some wicked powerful swim and club moves. Its like his arms are independent of his body and strong as legs.
Sure hope so. I didn't watch all that much of Aldon. I did watch a half-dozen Missouri games (just to evaluate Gabbert, mostly), but it wasn't often I saw Aldon stand out. I know he was coming off an injury, and he has shown that power you speak of a times.
Am so hoping he can turn out to be our next Charles Haley.
Yes he reminds me of Haley or R. White but more slim. He throws guards and tackles down like they were kids at time.
Take a look at his arms. They are like legs.

Staff Report
Humboldt Sentinel
Despite the best efforts of consumer rights groups and universal Internet access advocates, the Goliath beat the daylights out of David this weekend with the signing of
California Senate Bill 1161.
The bill guarantees a regulation-free future for telecommunications corporations pushing to end the old land-line lifeline in favor of Internet Protocol telephones.
In his signing statement, Governor Jerry Brown (D–Oakland) pointed to the weak power of the California Public Utilities Commission to compile complaints and report them to the Federal Communications Commission and the Legislature as sufficient to keep the telecoms in line.
“VoIP providers will continue to contribute to the State’s universal service programs and provide E-911 access,” Brown stated.” The bill does not affect the authority of the California Public Utilities Commission regarding the construction and maintenance of facilities and access to utility support structures, including pole attachments.”
SB 1161 was hatched by the American Legislative Exchange Council, a 50-state spanning lobby of many of the world’s largest transnational corporations, including AT&T and Verizon.
It was in their interest that SB 1161 powered through the state legislature this summer, with the support of corporatist Republicans and neoliberal Democrats alike.
Lobbyists Jim Hawley of TechNet and Kristine Berman of TechAmerica crowed about their victory on their respective websites:
“The Governor’s signature on this legislation will improve California’s worldwide technology leadership by establishing an Internet policy that supports innovation, investment and job creation,” Hawley and Berman stated. “Continued investment and innovation will bring California consumers more of the products, devices and services like VoIP they want and that are enhancing their lives.”
The motley crew of opponents — including The Utility Reform Network, Communications Workers of America, Media Alliance and local legislators like Assemblymembers Wes Chesbro (D–Arcata) & Jared Huffman (D–San Rafael) and State Senators Noreen Evans (D–Santa Rosa) and Mark Leno (D–San Francisco) — were simply overwhelmed by the lobbying power and campaign cash of ALEC and the telecoms.
“Governor Jerry Brown’s signing message for SB 1161 yesterday indicates that he believes the promises of private industry when their advocates say they will protect consumers, ensure public safety and secure universal access to open internet services,” Access Humboldt executive director Sean McLaughlin stated in a release.
“Given the history of telecommunications market failure and the lagging status of universal access to open internet in California and across the US, we see a great need for localism, competition and diversity in the communication networks that form our marketplace of ideas,” McLaughlin said.
“These are not trivial goals that industry has failed to meet, in spite
of many past promises, huge subsidies and large profits. So, we do
not agree with the Governor’s assessment of SB 1161,” he added.
McLaughlin’s warnings were echoed last month in a Wired.com op-ed by Harvard Law School professor Susan Crawford, who blasted the Legislature for caving in on open access concerns in favor of private profiteers fully exploiting public airwaves and spaces.
“Reliable, affordable, high-capacity, and neutral communications services are a vital input to the entire range of California businesses,” Crawford stated. .”
The bill’s signature jeopardize parts of the Telecommunications Element under consideration next month by the Humboldt County Board of Supervisors
as part of its General Plan Update process.
Read on for the full text of Governor Brown’s signing statement:
“Office of the Governor“Office of the Governor
September 28, 2012
To the Members of the California State Senate:
I am signing Senate Bill 1161 that limits California Public Utilities Commission (Commission) regulatory authority of Voice over Internet Protocol (VoIP) and Internet Protocol (IP) enabled services until January 1, 2020. This bill encourages the continued growth of these and other innovative services that have become a hallmark of our state.
The existing consumer protections safeguarded by this bill are crucial.
VoIP providers will continue to contribute to the State’s universal service programs and provide E-911 access. The bill preserves enforcement of State and federal civil and criminal laws and local ordinances of general applicability, including consumer protection rules and proscriptions against unfair competition. The bill does not affect the authority of the California Public Utilities Commission regarding the construction and maintenance of facilities and access to utility support structures, including pole attachments.
Importantly, the bill emphasizes the Commission’s authority to monitor, track and report complaints from VoIP customers to the Federal Communications Commission, and empowers the Commission to report their findings annually to the Legislature.
I know the Commission stands at the ready to be diligent in this effort. Likewise, I expect VoIP providers to cooperate fully and promptly to resolve consumer complaints brought to the attention of the Commission.
Sincerely,
Edmund G. Brown Jr.”

Those diverse influences and backgrounds were perfect preparation for creating original, hybridized music, which, to us anyway, was completely natural.
So it always struck me as bizarre when I’d hear about musical “balkanization,” of concerted efforts to keep different types of music compartmentalized and isolated. And it infuriated me in the ‘70s when such “progressive-rock” bands as Yes, Genesis, Gentle Giant, and Emerson, Lake, and Palmer were automatically deemed “pretentious” by many critics and rock adherents for incorporating their own varied tastes, influences, and musical educations into the rock paradigm. As was the case so many times before in music’s evolution, introducing fresh, new ideas to rock and roll apparently threatened the comfortable status quo of this presumably rebellious music, making progressive practitioners — at least in some quarters — more pariahs than pioneers.
When I first became aware of the “Third Stream” music of the late-’50s and early-’60s, I was struck both by the underlying logic of bridging the classical and jazz worlds, and by its ultimate failure to catch on. When deconstructed, both jazz and classical music boast groundbreaking, immortal music and jaw-dropping virtuosity. If jazz’s emphasis on improvisation is an important distinction, it’s not necessarily a deal-breaker, especially when you consider that Handel, Bach, Beethoven, Mozart, and Haydn were notable improvisers. American-born musicologist/composer/conductor Gunther Schuller must’ve felt that way, because he not only staked his reputation on creating a successful hybrid of the two genres, he even is credited with coining the term, Third Stream.
Of course, very little classical music has been created in a vacuum, and the introduction of non-classical elements to classical music is as old as the music itself. Many famous pieces are based on the traditional folk music of the composer’s homeland, or were inspired by visits to other countries. Popular dance music, especially, has been a favorite source material for centuries; Bach had the Sarabande, Chopin had the Polonaise, and Vienna’s Johann Strauss, Jr. had the waltz, which had its roots in 16th-century peasant dances. So it was only natural that when ragtime, early jazz, and the Charleston became the rage in America and Europe, 20th-century composers who were seeking new ideas began incorporating those rhythms and phrasings into their work.
In the 1920s and early ‘30s, attempts at classical-jazz or jazz-classical fusion were made by such so-called “serious” European composers as Darius Milhaud, Bohuslav Martinu, Matyás Seiber, Emil František Burian, and Stefan Wolpe, as well as by Americans George Gershwin and Aaron Copland. One of the most important of these figures was Hungarian-born Seiber, who considered jazz an art form when most people did not. Seiber became head of the first jazz department in a German conservatory, teaching and composing in Frankfurt at the same time that a Frankfurter named Theodor Adorno was making public pronouncements that jazz was anti-intellectual and provided a sense of “false freedom” for soloists.
Seiber ignored Adorno’s 30-year rant, as well as the defamation he later suffered in the Nazi press for his associations with jazz, and went on to write some of the finest music of his day. In the second installment of a show I call “Passing the Baton: Jazz Meets Classical at Midstream” (Johnny D’s Jazz Journal, May 26, 2013, 3-5 p.m.), I aired Seiber’s “Jazzolette #2”, written in 1932 and performed by a Dutch ensemble called Ebony Band, comprising members of Amsterdam’s Royal Concertgebouw Orchestra (under the baton of Werner Herbers, who founded the group in 1990). It’s on the CD, Dancing: The Jazz Fever of Milhaud, Martinu, Seiber, Burian & Wolpe (2011, Channel Classics import label).
A decade later, Russia’s Igor Stravinsky composed his Ebony Concerto for clarinet and jazz band for Woody Herman and his orchestra, and Polish pianist/composer Wladyslaw Szpilman (the inspiration for Roman Polanski’s Oscar-winning film, The Pianist, starring Adrien Brody), drew inspiration from jazz.
But Schuller’s later advocacy was significant for its missionary-like zeal. He actively sought a middle ground between the two musics, and to that end, co-founded the Modern Jazz Society with jazz pianist John Lewis in 1955. Lewis’s band, the Modern Jazz Quartet, became a standard-bearer for the hyphenate subgenre, even titling one of its albums, Third Stream Music. For their efforts, MJQ was by some for being musically conservative in the wake of the adventurous work of Charlie Parker and others, and their almost neoclassical approach earned the not altogether complimentary label, “chamber jazz.” But the foursome persevered as tastes continued to evolve, and the MJQ outlasted its detractors to become one of jazz’s most popular and critically lauded groups.
Still, for various reasons, Third Stream never truly caught on. Some listeners found Schuller’s middle ground an academic no-man’s-land in which the two musics’ strengths were canceled out rather than intensified. Certainly, the genres are not easily bridged, in part because a number of musicians on either side of that aisle always will regard the other genre somewhat warily.
It’s also possible that ethnic and nationalistic biases came to bear. Classical music is, after all, a European construct, and jazz is an American, and specifically an African-American art form born of a very Yankee strain of spirited, spontaneous expression. So it would make sad sense if jazz musicians considered the infusion of high-brow “foreign” music the creative equivalent of adding starch to a favorite comfy shirt. Conversely, conservatory-trained classical musicians and composers would have reason to balk at melding centuries of musical tradition and a deep canon of style and content with a renegade form of music that took shape in brothels, saloons, and on street corners.
And maybe, just maybe, people in the 1950s had already been turned off by the ongoing debate between the two camps, which at times grew pretty clamorous. As far back as 1947, drummer Gene Krupa and then-up-and-coming conductor Leonard Bernstein had heated, public exchanges on the relationship between jazz and classical music. The intelligent and articulate Krupa, who listened almost exclusively to symphonic music at home, and, like Bill Evans, could expound on Ravel or Grieg as astutely as he could on Armstrong or Ellington, thought there was little or no trace of jazz in even the most touted jazz-influenced orchestral works.
“Leonard Bernstein and others profess to hear traces, echoes, derivations of jazz in [the music of] Frederick Delius, John Alden Carpenter, Manuel de Falla, Honeger, Prokofiev, even Shostakovitch,” Krupa told Down Beat editor Gene Lees during a series in interviews conducted at recording sessions and backstage at New York’s Capitol Theatre. “I disagree. I’ve never heard anything genuinely and honestly derivative of jazz in any such music, even, maybe especially, in such works as Igor Stravinsky’s Ebony Suite...I’ve never heard it in a single one of the ‘serious’ pieces of George Gershwin...I’ve never heard the least echo of [jazz], or any music like it, in [Maurice Ravel’s] compositions.
“Jazz cannot be approached from the outside,” Krupa said. “It cannot be approached synthetically and artificially. Above all, it cannot be approached unsympathetically. Too many ‘good,’ ‘pure’, and ‘serious’ musicians...approach the native American idiom, the jazz idiom, with intolerance, even with condescension. They stoop, but not to conquer. And so, they almost invariably make an unholy mess of their attempts.”
Bernstein, who actively incorporated jazz elements into his orchestral compositions, strongly held the opposite view. He believed that jazz greatly influenced modern classical music even when that influence might be difficult to pinpoint.
“My old piano teacher, Heinrich Gebhard, used to say that music is divisible into melody, harmony, rhythm, form, counterpoint, and color,” Bernstein wrote in an Esquire magazine essay. “Jazz has influenced our composers on all six counts.” He added that rhythm was the “most important” of these influences, and went on to explain how jazz-derived syncopation (the placement of accents on weak beats or in unexpected places) “opened up new vistas for the serious composer.” He concluded his treatise with a declaration that seemed aimed at his good friend, Gene Krupa — that jazz components had “unconsciously become common usage among American composers. And the startling thing is that very rarely does this music sound like jazz!”
If the jazz-versus-classical debate no longer rages as it once did, perhaps that’s because many musicians who’ve emerged in the last three or four decades — Claude Bolling, Lalo Schifrin, Keith Jarrett, Wynton Marsalis, Chick Corea, Joshua Redman, Chris Botti — seem perfectly comfortable tapping each genre for inspiration, even crossing over from one to the other when the mood strikes. If nothing else, that continuing development will give me plenty of source material for future installments of “Passing the Baton: Jazz Meets Classical at Midstream”. I hope you’ll tune-in.

Uploaded a first preliminary version of the new bibsonomy crawler to:
Just import it into the same workspace as the aperture trunk and try
runnin the ExampleBibsonomyCrawler class. Before we merge it with the
trunk though:
1. swrc doesn't contain properties for many important bits of
information (e.g. the bibtex key), we'll have to make some extensions
2. swrc contains classes like Person and Organization,the current code
uses nco:Contacts for Persons and doesn't create proper instances of
nco:OrganizationContact, and places plain strings instead - it can't
be left like this.
3. I couldn't find a proper definition of the burst ontology, used NAO
for tags instead
4. burst uses rdf:Seq's for authors and editors - I used rdf:List (for
the time being)
5. there is no way to detect modified entries, the hash is a part of
the URI, so a new uri = a new resource.
Incorporating SWRC in the bibsonomy crawler is important for a number of reasons
- validation won't work (OWL, collections)
- the Person and Organization classes will overlap with NCO
- BURST will overlap with NAO
I.e. the SWRC/BURST simply doesn't fit within the rest of the
framework. An application that can do things like "show me all
occurences of this person", will have to search for all nco:Contacts
AND swrc:Persons. When we wrote NIE, the goal was to avoid situations
like this. Whether or not this is a problem - let the users speak.

AA + iron-induced cytotoxicity model is an effective experimental model for screening drugs for liver disease [7]. To determine whether or not RGE protects liver cells from AA + iron-induced injury, HepG2 cell viability was measured by MTT assay after treatment with different doses of RGE. Treatment with AA + iron significantly reduced cell viability compared with the control group as shown in Figure 1A. However, RGE treatment inhibited AA + iron treatment-induced cell death in a dose-dependent manner, and cell viability was completely recovered by treatment with 1 mg/ml of RGE (Figure 1A). To further investigate the cytoprotective effects of RGE on AA + iron-induced liver cell injury, TUNEL assay was performed at a dose of 1 mg/ml. Treatment with 1 mg/ml of RGE alone did not induce hepato-cytotoxicity, whereas the same dose (1 mg/ml) of RGE significantly reduced AA + iron-induced cell death (Figure 1B). To confirm the cytoprotective effects of RGE on AA + iron-induced cell death, the levels of PARP and procaspase-3 were measured by immunoblot analysis. Treatment with AA + iron induced cleavage of PARP and procaspase-3, resulting in cell death. In contrast, decreases in the levels of PARP and procaspase-3 induced by AA + iron were inhibited by treatment with RGE (Figure 1C). These results indicate that RGE has cytoprotective effects against apoptosis in hepatocytes induced by AA + iron.
Figure 1.
To investigate the mechanism underlying the protective effects of RGE on AA + iron-induced liver cell death, ROS generation was measured by FACS with or without RGE treatment. There was no ROS generation in RGE alone-treated cells comparable to control cells. AA + iron treatment significantly induced ROS generation, whereas RGE treatment completely inhibited ROS production (Figure 2A). To further investigate the anti-oxidative effects of RGE on AA + iron-treated cells, GSH was measured by the colorimetric method. The intracellular concentration of GSH in HepG2 cells was reduced by treatment with AA + iron (Figure 2B). Treatment with RGE increased the intracellular concentration of GSH and inhibited the AA + iron-induced reduction of GSH. Taken together, these data indicate that RGE inhibits AA + iron-induced ROS generation and GSH reduction.
Figure 2.
Next, we determined whether or not AA + iron-induced liver cell death is mediated by mitochondrial dysfunction. We measured fluorescence intensity in HepG2 cells stained with rhodamine 123 by FACS. MMP was not altered by treatment with RGE alone compared with the control group (Figure 3A). The number of rhodamine 123-negative cells increased AA + iron treatment, whereas it was significantly reduced by RGE co-treatment (Figure 3B). These results indicate that RGE prohibits AA + iron-induced ROS generation and dysfunction of MMP to protect liver cells.
Figure 3.
To further investigate the mechanism of RGE during hepatocyte protection, the AMPK pathway was analyzed by immunoblot analysis. The phosphorylation levels of AMPK and ACC increased upon RGE treatment, and protein levels reached their maximums at 0.5-1 h and 1-3 h, respectively (Figure 4A and B). AMPK and ACC were also phosphorylated upon RGE treatment in both H4IIE and AML12 immortalized hepatocyte cell lines (Figure 4C).
Figure 4..
LKB1, the upstream kinase of AMPK, was also phosphorylated by RGE treatment in HepG2, H4IIE, and AML12 cell lines (Figure 5A). Phosphorylation of AMPK and ACC was not detectable in LKB1-null HeLa cells (Figure 5B). Furthermore, phosphorylation of AMPK and ACC was decreased by knock-down of LKB1 in RGE-treated HepG2 cells (Figure 5C). Additionally, STO609 (1 μg/ml), an inhibitor of calcium/calmodulin-dependent kinase kinase (CaMKK) β, another upstream kinase of AMPKα, had no effect in reversing RGE-induced AMPKα phosphorylation (Figure 5D). These data indicate that RGE treatment activates the AMPK-ACC pathway in hepatocytes via activation of LKB1.
Figure 5.
To determine the involvement of AMPK in RGE-induced protection of hepatocytes, MMP was measured after treatment with Compound C, an AMPK inhibitor (Figure 6A). There was no protective effect of RGE against AA + iron-induced mitochondrial dysfunction in AMPK inhibitor-treated cells (Figure 6B), verifying that AMPK is the key protein protecting liver cells upon RGE treatment. All of these data indicate that RGE activates the AMPK pathway to protect hepatocytes against AA + iron (Figure 6C).

The sauce had a life before this transformation. Years before, my friend Kevin (the “K” of P&K), was making a remarkable BBQ sauce in his spare time. It was so good I urged him to get the sauce on the market. One day Kevin shared the recipe with me on a napkin and said: “Do what you want with it…it’s yours!”We understand that some of you might want to go out on Valentine's Day, in order to really express your feelings for your beloved or your homies or your lapdog or whoever your Valentine is this year. But we beseech you, don't go to a restaurant where reservations are required or only a prix fixe menu is available that night. The restaurant owners at those establishments will love you for paying the inflated prices, but the servers and cooks are sneering at you -- they know they're putting out substandard food. Instead, go somewhere entirely non-romantic. It's cheaper, more delicious, and low-pressure. Here are our top picks for Valentine's Day!
J & J
This San Gabriel Valley hole-in-the-wall has the best commercially available xiao long bao in the county, and I won't hear different. Their pan-fried dumplings are delectable too -- well, just about everything on the menu is. The bright lights and the inelegant way you're bound to eat the xlb and Shanghai noodles are sure to make for an entirely unsexy, but very delicious, night. (Sometimes they're cash only, so come prepared.)
Santouka
Is this our favorite counter-service restaurant in a grocery store? As far as we can recall, yes. The food court remains open to ramen slurpers after the store closes, so it feels a bit lonely, but the warming soup -- always a contender in the city's best-ramen wars -- helps with that. And maybe you can sneak into the produce section and make out after you've cleared your tray.
Tender Greens
There's always a line for salads and ethically-raised meats (and mashed potatoes -- Tender Greens is the rare restaurant that makes them as good as homemade) at every TGs location, but ... the better to stare into each others' eyes as you shuffle along? And if you order one of the less-indulgent salads, you won't be too full for a little of the ol' wink-wink nudge-nudge after dinner.
Manna Korean BBQ (or BCD Tofu House)
Korean food is so gosh-darn delectable that we couldn't choose just one subcategory. Either go to the screaming bacchanal of meats and flashing lights that is Manna (it's one of those all you can eat joints, so we're promising quantity over quality here, but it still tastes good), or hit up BCD after-hours for a million tiny plates of delicious items, including a whole fried fish. Feed each other fish cheeks and fall in love all over again.
Ruen Pair
It's spicy and it's up all night! That's enough reason to hit up this strip-mall classic on Valentine's Day, but it also has some of the best Thai food in town (and we all know that's saying something). Try the morning glory, the greens with crispy pork, and one of the soups. (Cash only.)

This topic gained wider exposure and took on new meaning when we published Scott Bestul’s article, “What Would You Do?” in the December issue.
The article was one of the most-read pieces we published this past year, as evidenced by a surge in activity on our Web site. Included in that traffic is a link that is still generating debate at deeranddeerhunting.com.
In the article, we presented four hypothetical situations, ranging from the ethics of shooting locked bucks to hunting from stands on or very near property boundaries. Although we provided multiple-choice options, there were no right or wrong answers — just a starting point for each discussion.
In one scenario, we asked what you would do if you discovered a neighbor’s penned deer escaped and was seen roaming your land. Would you let the deer’s owner onto your land to “hunt” the trophy buck with a tranquilizer gun so he could return it to his pen? Or, would you deny access and try to kill the deer yourself? Your opinions ranged from indifference to passionate pleas on both ends of the spectrum.
“If it’s really a game farm buck, then I don’t want him anyway,” wrote Woods Walker. “I like to hunt WILD deer, not life support systems for large calcium deposits.”
Kuzco16901 wrote, “I would tell the guy ‘tough luck.’ I would be as polite as I could. I doubt he would let me onto his land no matter what the reason, mostly because I do not agree with hunting fenced animals. To me, that is not a sport … it is killing.”
Another interesting comment came from longtime Web contributor Shaman, who wrote: “If an escaped political prisoner comes through my woods, I see nothing. I hear nothing. No deer here. Best keep moving if you want to catch such a dangerous fugitive. Give me your number, I’ll call you if I see anything. Do I shoot him? Heck, no. I want him to have as much fun with my does as possible.”
In another scenario, Bestul paints a scene where the hunter comes upon a buck hopelessly tangled in a barbwire fence. As the hunter ponders whether or not he should put the deer out of its misery and tag it, an even larger buck appears (well within shooting range), yet is unaware of the hunter’s presence.
Which buck would you kill?
“The trophy goes down,” wrote Shaman. “The trapped buck then gets my full attention. If he’s that close to death, my bullet is not going to save him much, and this is far from a fair-chase kill.”
Hilltop disagreed. “I had already decided to free the deer before I read the part about a bigger buck,” he wrote. “So, I would take the bigger deer and free the smaller one.”
Dtrain56 offered another view. “I would shoot the wounded deer, tag it and have some nice jerky.
And from Squirrelhawker: “We do not hunt in a tidy, controllable vacume. At least, I do not. Stuff happens. Sometimes we need to roll with it as long as it is legal.”

Tigermania comes to Fort Worth, for one year only
In the spring of 1997, Tigermania was at its apex. Tiger Woods had won the Masters by 12 strokes and then won the GTE Byron Nelson Classic in Las Colinas. And the 21-year old dominated the classic Colonial course for the first three days, with rounds of 67, 65 and 64. With record crowds watching, he closed with a 2-over 72 and finished tied for fourth with Paul Goydos, three strokes behind winner David Frost.
Two dramas unfolded along the way.
On the Monday of Colonial week, Woods signed a $13 million deal with American Express, but MasterCard was Colonial's sponsor and its logo appeared in the background of his press conferences. The rumors began swirling that there was "no way" Tiger would return to Colonial because of a conflict of interest with the title sponsor.
Even though Bank of America came on board as the tournament sponsor for four years, and brought Annika Sorenstam in 2003, Tiger never returned.
The other story that gained momentum had to do with the first meeting of Woods and 1981 Colonial champion Fuzzy Zoeller following Zoeller's insensitive remarks after Tiger's Masters win. Tournament officials were supposedly trying to organize a practice round between the two as a show that they had made up, but the intense media coverage of the Tiger-Fuzzy story eventually created backlash, and some unruly fans were reportedly heard shouting racial epithets at Woods during his rounds in Fort Worth.
Whatever his reasons, Woods eventually admitted what many had already assumed to be true -- it was unlikely he'd return. The course, he said, did not fit his game.
Many fans still hold out hope Tiger will be overcome by a sense of golf history and return to Colonial. The mere news he was on the club's grounds back in 2008 to shoot a Nike Golf commercial got the chatter started again. But five years later ... still no Tiger.
Phil Mickelson loses his love for Colonial
Phil Mickelson, aka Lefty, is a two-time winner of the plaid jacket, taking home $594,000 in 2000 and $1,098,000 in 2008. His second win provided one of the most dramatic shots in the history of the tournament, when he hit a wedge from the trees on 18 to within a few feet of the pin and drained the putt.
The week prior to his title defense in 2009, Mickelson had to withdraw from Colonial because his wife, Amy, was diagnosed with breast cancer. Colonial officials organized a "Pink Out" in the third round, with players and fans urged to wear pink in support of breast cancer research and the Mickelson family. Phil returned in 2010, but missed the cut and "Pink Out II."
"The Pink Out is really something that's pretty cool. I'm so flattered. I wish I was going to be here to partake in that," Mickelson said. "I will be wearing pink tomorrow, but in San Diego. Monday is Amy's birthday and so it will give me a chance to spend the weekend with her to celebrate."
Mickelson soon changed his tune, though, and rather than praise Colonial and its organizers for all they done to honor his wife, he took shots at the Keith Foster redesign of several holes.
"With the redesign, I’m afraid I won’t be playing it (Colonial) anymore," he had also been the main spokesperson for sponsor Crowne Plaza's TV ads. When he split with the hotel chain, he didn't hesitate to let his feelings on the course be known.
Making matters worse in 2011, Mickelson played the Byron Nelson tournament up the road in Las Colinas but skipped Colonial.
Annika draws huge attention to Colonial, but at what price?
For a few days in May 2003, Fort Worth was the epicenter of the sports world as Annika Sorenstam became the first female golfer in 58 years to compete against men in a PGA Tour event. The green 'Go Annika" buttons -- the brainchild of then-Colonial assistant golf pro Chris Rowe -- were the hottest item in town.
On Thursday morning, the 10th tee was completely surrounded for Sorenstam's opening shot, which she striped down the middle of the fairway. For Friday's round, Annika played in the afternoon and drew record crowds.
Playing alongside Aaron Barber and Dean Wilson, the world's top female golfer shot 71 and 74 and missed the cut.
When Annika left town, she took the buzz with her. The sold-out tournament went quiet on the weekend and a lot of the talk turned to Vijay Singh, who dropped Colonial from his schedule after winning the Byron Nelson the week before. Singh was outspoken about Sorenstam getting a sponsor's exemption in place of someone he thought would have been more worthy. Defending champion Nick Price called it a publicity stunt. Rumor has it many other players were upset, just not as vocal. The silent majority's opinion played out in the next several years as the strength of the field fell off, only beginning to recover with the 2008 tournament win by Mickelson.
This is the 10-year anniversary of Annika-Palooza, which, for better or worse, was a turning point in Colonial history. It also marked the first of Kenny Perry's two Colonial titles.Sorry, this item is currently

Loch Lomond, situated in the Trossachs National Park, is a dream come true for outdoor enthusiasts. Whether you love walking, cycling, boating or swimming, you’ll have plenty of opportunities to burn any excess energy. The UK’s largest lake is surrounded by many quiet little villages, including the village of Tarbet where you’ll find the Bay Tarbet Hotel.
Usually when you find a destination that features a huge lake surrounded by small villages, you expect an atmosphere of peace and quiet. Whilst that’s certainly an option if you’re visiting Loch Lomond, you’ll find that the area, in fact, has so much more to offer. Enjoy a relaxing holiday or short break amongst tranquil surroundings, or instead opt for an exciting adventure filled with hiking, climbing, fishing and some of the most varied and exciting water sports available across the whole country. Loch Lomond is the largest lake in the whole of the United Kingdom, giving plenty of opportunities for boating, swimming, canoeing and water skiing, as well as more sedate activities.
Being set amongst the Trossachs National Park ensures that Loch Lomond is surrounded by awe-inspiring scenery. If you’d rather stay dry then you’ll find some fantastic walking and cycling routes all around the lake, showcasing the finest landscapes of Scotland. Nearby Callander acts as a great place to stop and rest, but there are plenty of villages dotted around the region should you be struck by the need for refreshment.
Rated as one of the top attractions not just in the region but in the whole of Scotland, the Loch Lomond Bird of Prey Centre is one of the most comprehensive in Britain. It is the ideal family day out, where everyone can learn about the many bird species that live in the centre. You’ll have plenty of opportunities to take part in special activities, such as meeting the owls or undertaking a hawk walk.
Anyone that still has energy to burn after trying out all of the water sports in the area can visit ‘Go Ape!’ at Aberfoyle. This outdoor adventure course, set amongst the trees, provides an exciting opportunity to walk along bridges, try out zip lines and prove that you’re not afraid of heights. If you like keeping your feet a little closer to the ground then you can race around the Segway adventure course, or simply enjoy the on-site refreshments as the rest of your travel party work up a sweat.
Loch Lomond and The Trossachs National Park stretches across Scotland quite the distance from the loch itself, so within the confines of the region you’ll find plenty to see within a short driving distance. There are castles, such as the popular Kilchurn Castle, and numerous golf courses on which to test your skills. Your Loch Lomond hotel will give you the freedom to holiday as you wish – either relaxing and enjoying the landscapes, or seeking adventure in every direction.

Economical home solar energy systems
Eugene, Oregon based solar panel manufacturer Grape Solar recently announced that its home solar energy systems are now being sold online by Costco Wholesale Corp. The development gives the Eugene-based company nationwide distribution and puts it nearer to its goal of making solar power systems more accessible to American consumers.
“For the first time, a leading retailer with numerous locations, quality recognition and tens of millions of loyal customers has made it possible for end users to buy high-quality solar products at great prices and have the products delivered directly to their homes in a matter of days,” Ocean Yuan, Grape Solar’s president, said in a news release.
Installation of home solar panels
A smart home owner does the research before making a substantial investment. And one thing that will come into play when considering a home solar energy system is the installation. Can you install the solar system yourself? Who can you trust if you decide to hire someone to install the system? RenewableEnergyJobs.com has a detailed list of states and the resources available for training in the solar installation field. If you are not a do-it-yourself kind of homeowner, Grape Solar offers a solar installer resources section on their web site with tips and helpful information to help you choose the installer for the project. system will continue to decrease.
Cons of home solar panels
Many home owners are reluctant to install solar panels on their home because some people feel they are not aesthetically pleasing. But if you are one of the lucky home owners, the southern area of your home is not visible from the street.. And by installing a home solar energy system on your house, when it comes time to sell your home, the solar panels could very well increase the likelihood of converting a visitor into a buyer. In time, solar panels will result in savings on your home energy bill, which could help pay the mortgage. But most importantly, it’s just the right thing to do.Folk singer Laura Gibson, who has performed with The Decemberists’ Colin Meloy and Laura Veirs, will be the special guest when the Portland-based variety show Entertainment for People makes its Seattle debut Friday at the Theatre off Jackson.

A Tale of Two Accessible Cities full articleYou really can't miss the signposts. Brassy and insistent the humour in PHIR HERA PHERI takes off from where the first part left off four years ago. In case anyone has forgotten the first part of the film PHIR HERA PHERI serves up constant and whopping reminders of what once was.
To writer-director Neeraj Vora's credit he succeeds in establishing a sense of continuity between the first part and the new edition of the HERA PHERI series (we presume it's a series because the film ends on an open note).
The three protagonists Akshay Kumar, Suniel Shetty and Paresh Rawal are still bumbling through what looks like a labyrinth of mind-boggling zigs and zags. Their bickering is still school-boyish but noisily entertaining. The plot tends to get into comic curves from which it seems impossible to retrieve it. But then there's always the next gag to giggle over. Vora handles the characters with amusing aplomb. The trio of main players shuffle and juggle through what looks like a spiral of absurdities contrived to spotlight middleclass avarice.
Akshay Kumar is the key to the film's effectuality. He hops skips and jumps through the absurd mime-games with unbridled gusto, dropping all inhibitions before the camera. Paresh Rawal is again in comic form. He always ends up adding that extra sparkle to almost every scene. Suniel Shetty is a quiet and responsive foil to his co-stars.
The three original HERA PHERI players are this time supported by an avalanche of eccentric overwrought characters from the fringes who enter and exit with amazing lack of grace. Often the canvas resembles the waiting room for a crowded railway station. The actors get into the swing of it with sweaty enthusiasm. Johnny Lever keeps his mood remarkably somber. Too bad, audiences misconstrue his sobriety for satire. Sharad Saxena and Bhojpuri superstar Ravi Kissan as a couple of stammering gangsters swing the film's mood from the cinema of Indra Kumar to Priyadarshan, with dollops of David Dhawan thrown in for good measure. And then there's Bipasha Basu playing a con-girl, a bargirl dancer, a victim of fate and what have you.
Does it all add up? Yes and no. The film has a certain rise-and-shine rhythm. But it fails to generate enough interest in the characters we already know. As is typical of all Hindi comedies, the canvas is cluttered with corny characters who con and go at the narration's well. However if positivity is a predominant instinct in any comedy, then PHIR HERA PHERI scores decent marks for remaining on the right side of the line of decorum. Known for his crude dialogues, writer-director Neeraj Vora keeps this film remarkably free of vulgarity.
But if you think you can laugh incessantly at the goings-on just because Akshay, Paresh and Suniel make a terrific team, then you're wrong. The climax in a circus has the entire cast of heroes, villains, henchmen, con men, damsels-in-distress, plus a kidnapped little girl and a gorilla, running helter-skelter.
Maybe the sequel bites more than it can chew. But the comic romp has its biting moments.Jason Derulo has opened up about what people can expect from his new album, Everything Is 4....more

The guy behind the Query Optimizer, Conor Cunningham, is speaking on Sep 27 (well, Sep 28 here in Adelaide) to the User Group in a few weeks’ time. I only wish that he could be there in person, but as he lives in Texas, it’s much cheaper for everyone if he uses LiveMeeting. But it’s still a massive honour, as Conor is one of the most respected and knowledgeable people working in SQL Server anywhere, inside or outside Microsoft.
I’ve heard many people refer to his talk at SQLBits VI as the highlight of the conference, and this is the talk that he’s going to present for us as well – called “Inside the SQL Server Query Optimizer”. I’m expecting it to be excellent, and I only wish I could be there. Luckily, as it is via LiveMeeting, I hope to be tuned in. If you can’t be there (because you’ll be somewhere else), then feel free to join us via LiveMeeting as well. I’ll post a link in the comments here a few days beforehand. If you are due to be in Adelaide, then please try to be there in person, as user groups are so much more than just the content. Come to spend time with other SQL people. For those not in Adelaide, here’s a list of times around the world (thanks to timeandate.com).
Interestingly, on the same day, Adelaide is hosting another free event – about Windows Phone 7. My good friend Nick Randolph will be in town on the Monday and Tuesday to teach people about how to write applications for WP7. They’re planning to time lunch on the Tuesday to cater for anyone who wants to pop downstairs to Conor’s session, which is excellent of him. Nick is a terrific advocate for communities, having run groups and set up communities in both Perth and Sydney over the years. If you can get to his day (which remember, is FREE – just like the SQL User Group), then registration info is at his blog. Seats are limited for Nick’s event, so please only register if you’re very serious, but get in early.

Rockland — Although he ran Rockland's Strand Theatre for a number of years, Meredith Dondis did not like watching movies all that much.
What he loved was working at the theater, especially when there was a long line and he could talk to all of the people as he took their tickets, according to his daughter Jo Dondis.
Meredith Dondis, who died at the age of 93 on Feb. 4, grew up and lived his life in Rockland, serving as one of the community's prominent businessmen, as a school board member, a Rotarian and a member of the Adas Yoshuron synagogue. He is remembered as much for his personality as he is for his activities.
He was known for telling animated stories in the local coffee shop, standing up for what he believed was right on the school board and, in later years, fighting with the Bureau of Motor Vehicles.
"It was very important to him that people knew that he was honest, and fair, and stood up for what was right," Jo Dondis said. "And he had a sense of humor, and he was funny, and he could tell a great story."
Meredith Dondis, born in 1920, was the eldest son of Joseph and Ida Mae Dondis. His father's family moved to Rockland from Kiev when Joseph was just 2 years old.
Joseph Dondis is known for founding The Strand Theatre on Main Street and opening it in 1923. Meredith Dondis grew up in Rockland, playing with his cousins, who lived on Tillson Avenue.
Meredith's grandfather had helped found the synagogue in 1913.
After graduating from Rockland High School in 1937 and the University of Maine in 1941, Meredith joined the Army. He was stationed in Seattle during World War II, and liked the city so much he thought about settling there, according to his daughter.
He came home to be there for his mother around the time his father died.
He ran Meredith Furniture on Main Street from 1948 to 1985. He used to tell his family a story about a 99-year-old woman coming into the store to buy a sofa. When she asked him if she could pay for it in installments, he was worried she could drop dead before the furniture was paid off, but he knew it wouldn't be right to turn her down and said: "Of course, dear."
A year later, she had paid it off in full and came back to buy a dining room set. Once again, on an installment plan.
Jo Dondis was unsure whether her father liked the furniture business or the movie theater business better. She noted that they came at different times in his life. There were other movie theaters in Rockland's downtown in the past. There was the Park or Knox Theater and the Empire Theater on Oak Street. At one point, Meredith managed one of these competing theaters, having learned the family business.
“My father built the theater and opened it in 1923,” Dondis told a VillageSoup reporter when the Strand's marquee was being unveiled in 2005. “I ran things for about 15 years or so, after my mother called me up and said she was ready to retire, but my family operated it for three-quarters of a century."
Meredith took over the Strand after his mother, Ida, retired in 1980. The theater continued showing first-run movies through the end of the 1990s.
The theater fell on hard times in the early 2000s after Flagship Cinemas opened just over the line in Thomaston.
Dondis retired in 2000, and sold the theater to Peter Vivian of New Jersey. In turn, Vivian sold it to Flagship Cinemas in 2001.
The Strand was closed for a few years, and was purchased in 2004 by longtime Rockport summer residents (the late) Matthew and Ellen Simmons. The new owners renovated the theater, improving the facade, marquee and interior. It reopened in a large celebration July 3, 2005.
"I think this is going to be a great asset to the community," Dondis said in 2005. "It will help the merchants and the restaurants down here and offer cultural benefits as well. I think it’s just great. Mr. Simmons has done a great service to the community.”
In addition to his work, Dondis was active in the community. He had a reputation for standing up for teachers and school employees on the school board, sometimes even when he was the lone voice of dissent.
He served on the synagogue board for a time and participated in the high holidays. He read Hebrew fluently and passed on what he knew to the next generation, tutoring kids for their Bar Mitzvahs.
"It is nearly impossible to express how much he meant to this congregation, and to the city of Rockland," an online posting from the synagogue states. "To say he will be sorely missed is inadequate. He leaves behind him a space that will not be filled by anyone else, and a legacy of service, dedication, and involvement that will be remembered always. There is surely not one person who attends High Holiday services at Adas Yoshuron who will ever forget his chanting of the Haftorah, which he continued to recite annually, and without hesitation, year after year, including this past Yom Kippur. His inimitable voice will forever resonate in the synagogue sanctuary."
There are many stories to be told about Meredith, and one came in his later years. He was driving downtown and went the wrong way down a one-way street. A police officer stopped him, and he told the officer he was confused.
His daughter said Meredith was not confused. "He knew exactly what he was doing," she said. "But when you're in your 80s and you tell someone you're confused, that was not a good thing."
The state took his license, and to get it back he had to get a note from his doctor and take driver's education again. Even after jumping through all of these hoops, the state restricted him to driving within a 25-mile radius.
"At this point, he really didn't drive more than that because, if he ever went anywhere, my mother drove because he didn't like to drive that much," Jo Dondis recalled. "But he was so upset. He felt that he was being discriminated against."
He hired attorney Paul Gibbons of Camden to help him fight to get his driver's license back.
He filed an appeal in Knox County Superior Court against the Maine Bureau of Motor Vehicles, claiming the restrictions were vague, and that he was discriminated against on the basis of age bias.
Meredith won that particular battle.
"He hardly drove after that, but he wanted it back," his daughter said. "… As a result of this, he became this folk hero in town. I just remember going downtown with him and older people would come up to him and say, 'Go Meredith, you know you did the right thing!'"
For a time after that, according to Jo Dondis, Gibbons received numerous calls from other elderly people interested in fighting for their rights.
There were other aspects to Meredith. He was a Rotarian and a Shriner. In his spare time he was an avid reader. He is best remembered for his work with the movie theater.
However, he is perhaps most fondly remembered telling funny stories and sharing his opinions with his friends at a downtown coffee shop.
He will be missed, but not forgotten.

I just saw your post -- coincidentally just one day after you say that you were going to be in Norfolk at the court house. Anyway, I live in Norfolk, and I'm the author of the research to which you referred about Amy Valentine and her daughter who was sold into slavery by a Jewish merchant from Norfolk. I'd be delighted to talk to you in much greater detail about all the work I've been doing. Please email me directly (ibstory@exis.net) and feel free to call me directly at 866-855-1272, and you'll either reach me or you'll be able to leave me a message. I am extremely eager to talk to you!

The exemption explicitly exempts the Securities and Exchange Commission from FOIA requests for information relating to “surveillance, risk assessments or other regulatory and oversight activities” and is designed to protected increased surveillance and investigatory powers granted to the SEC in an attempt to guard against future economic problems and recessions. John Nester, an SEC spokesman, summarized this intention, telling the press:
.”
I personally do not feel comfortable weighing in on the impact of this exemption on the federal FOIA, a topic with which I am less experienced. In addition, I don’t care to weigh in on any of the partisan debate surrounding the exemption, as I believe neutrality is key, especially within open records policies. I will however state that, despite popular opinion, the exemption or at least its intention is not that outrageous or even uncommon amongst state open records laws.
While almost all states exempt information like trade secrets and information which if released might result in unfair trade practices, both exemptions which could in fact cover some of the material the SEC is seeking to protect, many states expand on this by exempting financial investigatory materials. At least the following seven states have exemptions similar to the SEC’s new exemption:
However, while this exemption is not terribly uncommon and is generally granted with a good intention, namely protecting the financial and proprietary information collected from private agencies during regulatory investigations, the current Federal exemption has a few problems.
First and foremost the exemption as written is somewhat broad and poorly constructed. The first exemption found in the law merely applies old FOIA laws to new information gathered by the SEC. The exemption in the law found in Sec 112 (5)(C) states that “(C) FREEDOM OF INFORMATION ACT- Section 552 of title 5, United States Code, including the exceptions thereunder, shall apply to any data or information submitted under this subsection and subtitle B.” Essentially, this exemption is only applying the original exemptions set forth in the FOIA to the newly collected information by the SEC. This is not a broad reaching exemption, but merely a restatement of old exemptions.
However, the addition of Section 919I states,.
This exemption is slightly broader and more poorly written. While the exemption does seem to intend to only include investigatory information, the insertion of the phrase “other regulatory and oversight activities” broadens the scope and leaves a great deal of ambiguity. Therein lies the real problem with the bill. While the intention may be good, exemptions, like most laws originating in the legislature, should be arbitrary and clear, leaving little work for the courts to expand or clarify the legislation and consequentially little opportunity for government agencies to abuse the exemption.
In addition to poor wording, the fact that this exemption slid into such an enormous bill presents a serious problem for our legislature. Suggesting problems more with the legislative process rather than the bill itself, the inclusion of a hidden FOIA exemption poses a direct assault on American democratic values and the legislative process. The minute a bill becomes too large for a legislator to read entirely, let alone an average citizen, is the minute that the American government moves from a democracy by and for the people to a democracy by and for the bureaucracy. Citizens should vocally criticize their legislators on both sides of the isle for failing to bring to light such an important FOIA exemption prior to passage.
Thus, while the intention of the law is not outrageous or unheard of, the wording and the secrecy of the implementation will pose serious issues for the laws implementation and retention. The law should be modified so as to increase the specificity of the exemption, and the American public should become more vocally critical about the ability of legislators to slide in hidden legislation.

To read other articles on the bill, see: Obama signs broad reform of financial regulation into law and Fox News invents a rule exempting SEC from FOIA compliance
Esteemed colleague and Editor of WikiFOIA,
I am going to deviate from your neutrality to bring a few observations I have made to light. After searching all major news outlets, I was only able to find right-leaning news agencies such as FOX News reporting this story. With that in mind, one has to wonder just how much of the story is attacking the Obama administration based on a political agenda behind the news agency and how much is actually “underhanded legislation”. It seems that others agree with my assessment and have blogged and discussed the same thing on these two sites:
Republicans knock apparent FOIA exemption
Fox News invents a rule exempting SEC from FOIA compliance
I will agree with you that the provision needs to be closely monitored because of the poor wording, as does every exemption that has the potential to be abused. However, many laws are taken to our court system to be clarified every year. Writing legislation this way allows a committee or body to utilize exemptions tailored to their needs, and one hopes that it is done in a responsible manner. As this is not an ideal way for legislation to be passed it has often been the case throughout the years. For this reason it often falls to our judicial system to interpret how a law should be enforced. Bottom line, one would expect that a Government body would utilize their power responsibly, but as this is not always the case the situation does need to be monitored.
I will concede to your point that overly long and complex legislation is a hindrance to transparency, however if bills are not concise and detailed then someone will find a loophole or overlooked section and use it in a way that was not intended. There has been a recent push in both in legislative writing (Oregon simple language legislation
) and in financial agreement writing (Bank of America – One page loan)
to make simpler easier to understand documents.
In my state level research I have found that clauses that protect information submitted by financial institutions often are in place to protect trade secrets or personal privacy. As such, I disagree with your assessment that the legislation had “hidden” FOIA exemption clause. I am going to make the assumption that state and federal legislation share a few trends and say that the exemption was similar to existing legislation and was perhaps paraphrased into the bill. I would like to think that everyone who voted on the legislation read the bill in its entirety, but know that is likely not the truth. However, it is difficult to track who has read the entire bill and who has not, but I would agree that reading legislation in its entirety is what we as citizens pay our representatives to do and when they fail to do so they are failing to perform their job adequately.For press inquiries and information.Readers! Yes! You! How amazing is it that we have comics to read this week? I think it’s pretty great.
This week is going to be pretty stellar in terms of comics. So many X-Books, the Miracleman reprint, Rat Queens, Velvet, Green Lantern Corps., and so many more! Check out what we’re reading after the jump!
What’s on YOUR Pull List?

- ALL NEW X-MEN #21
- AMAZING X-MEN #3
- CONSTANTINE #10
- GOD IS DEAD #5
- MARVEL KNIGHTS HULK #2
- UNCANNY X-FORCE #16
- UNCANNY X-MEN #16
- VELVET #3
- X-MEN LEGACY #22
All New X-Men! Amazing X-Men! Uncanny X-Men! Uncanny X-Force! X-Men Legacy! This is my kind of week! Even if Uncanny X-Force isn’t really doing it for me. I’m excited. I mean, I’m dropping Uncanny X-Force here pretty soon, so overall, this is a pretty stellar X-book week.
Marvel Knights Hulk piqued my interest with #1 and I’m all for sticking through to #4. This is going to be a very fun ride.
And, oh, Velvet. Brubaker. Epting. This title is everything a spy-thriller-mystery needs to be.
Daniel Palacio
- MIRACLEMAN #1
It’s finally back in print! After 20+ years of bitter rights disputes and legal wranglings, I’m thrilled that Marvel was able to get Miraclelman back in print. “The Original Writer” outdid himself when he turned a strip about a British Captain Marvel ripoff into one of the greatest superhero stories of all time (In my opinion, even better than Watchmen and every bit as good as his Swamp Thing run). My only worry is that Marvel will feel the need to edit out all of the sex and violence (a later issue features an extended and graphic depiction of childbirth).
Blake Hamilton
- Rat Queens #4
I am never fully ready when I’m only getting one thing for the week. Even with just getting one thing, I am happy to say it is Rat Queens! I am very glad I took a chance on this title as it has been nothing but a constant reward for me. Very excited to get the B cover variant to nearly fill out Rat Queen group members.
Jonathan Francois
- RAT QUEENS #4
For a series that I picked up on a whim, I’ve been nothing but please with Rat Queens. The series is certainly not for everyone, but it’s almost exactly what I want in a comic series (being violence, sassy dialogue, and a murderous comic relief character). It’s also the only series that’s made me care about collecting the variant covers.

- A VOICE IN THE DARK #3
- ALEX + ADA #3
- EGOS #1
- GHOSTED #6
- THE ILLEGITAMATES #2
- IMAGINE AGENTS #4
- PROTECTORS INC #3
- RAT QUEENS #4
- VELVET #3
Alex + Ada is a slow paced comic, but it has been holding my attention to a great degree. I’ve stated before that I’d love some of the tech in this comic so I could become more of a hermit.
It has been revealed to me that Ghosted was only supposed to be as long as it’s first five-issue arc, and this week marks the first issue of a new chapter in Jackson T. Winters’ career as a ghost hunter.
Rat Queens is probably one of the most fun books of 2013, and I keep eating it up.
As we all know, Brubaker can do no wrong. If you aren’t reading Velvet, well, you’re missing out.
Paul Jaissle
- Prophet #42
- Thor God of Thunder #17
- Velvet #3
Even though I’ve never been much a Jame Bond/spy fan, I’ve really been enjoying Brubaker and Epting’s Velvet. It’s a clever twist on the genre, and it’s great to see those two working together again.
‘The Accursed’ storyline wraps up in this issue of Thor God of Thunder. It’s been an uneven story, but I’m hoping Aaron and Garney can stick the landing.
Prophet is one of the stranger books out there. I’m never quite sure where the story is going, but Brandon Graham and his collaborators seem to be exploring the possibilities of visual storytelling in the comics medium.
Nick Nelson
- All-New X-Men #21
- Amazing X-Men #3
- Fantastic Four #16
- Green Lantern Corps #27
- Superior Spider-Man #25
- Uncanny X-Men #16
More and more, my pull list is getting dominated by X-Men titles… and I’m more than ok with that. I will say that Amazing X-Men has failed to grab my attention yet, but I have hope that it will get better. On the other hand, Uncanny X-Men just keeps getting better and so does All-New X-Men.
On the other side of the Big 2 divide, I believe this is my last issue of Green Lantern Corps and I could not be more happy to be dropping all the Green Lantern books.
Finally, Superior Spider-Man is starting to really get better, though I will say that everything interesting about the main Spider-Man book has absolutely nothing to do with Spider-Man, but rather the support cast of characters and villains. But, with the announcement of Peter Parker returning in April, I think I can hold out just a bit longer to get Spidey back where it should be.

Deep class cuts have been approved at other district campuses as well, with Harbor College in Wilmington closely behind Pierce with a 29% reduction in classes for next semester.
Most cuts, including those at Valley College in Van Nuys and Mission College in Sylmar, generally fell between 10% and 20% of course offerings.
East Los Angeles College in Monterey Park is the only campus spared from the cuts, which are the result of a Board of Trustees edict that each college must live within its budget.Globacom, Nigeria’s National Telecoms Operator, is offering a free six-month data plan with Samsung Galaxy S3 and Samsung Note II for its subscribers, giving them an opportunity to enjoy instant internet connection from the smartphones.

The adventure playground at Diss Infant and Nursery School for Key Stage 1 pupils is currently taped off. Cuts in funding means children aged between six and seven have been missing out.
The Parent Teacher Association (PTA) at the school have so far raised £2,000, while a bid for the National Lottery’s Awards for All fund is being prepared.
To remove the existing play area, it would cost in the region of £5,900, but would leave the children nothing to play on, while the original idea for the area includes ‘pride’ rock structure, allowing children to climb, but costing in the region of £9,500.
Jane Corrick, finance officer at the school, is pleading with the local community to help, through funding or materials, to help make the area safe.
“It is a wooden playground and it is rotting and a bit of a health hazard now.
“We are seeking funding to make our condemned adventure playground safe and a reduction in funding has made it impossible to earmark these funds. It is urgently needed for our six to seven-year-olds.
“It would be a great benefit to our children to have access to physical learning, which is key to our philosophy and provision and it is of benefit to their learning in the classroom.”
If anyone can help, contact finance officer Jane Corrick at the school on 01379 642768 or email office@diss-inf.norfolk.sch.uk

It's not super unique, but it just smells great and I can't see anybody disliking this- it's very inoffensive but it's not feminine or too soft. Definitely a lot better than Allure Homme Sport because since I first smelt it, I've thought of the original sport as citrus juice which just burns your nose and tbe lemony mandarin is all I could smell in it, but tbis is softened a lot by the tonka and it just smells so much better.
My skin is terrible for projection and sillage but despite that, this still does well with projecting and lasts long too. I can see it becoming my signature scent also as it can easily be worn at any time during the entire year.
I don't know if its just my skin, but this smells almost exactly like Le Male. The similarity is crazy. This one has a greater use of tonka though, which gives it a very slightly sweeter scent on me.
Nonetheless, both are amazing scents. This one lasts on me forever. Although I feel its too heavy to wear during hot weather, unless you do like 2 sprays max.
Overall, if you like scents such as Le Male, you will totally enjoy this. Girls seem to love it as well. Its not unique, but its still a great add to any collection!
Fresh, hot, sexy, masculine and captivating .
A little more intense, Eau Extreme is a well done flanker, but do not expect innovation. Citrus opening of traditional Allure Sport, with a slight hint of mint mixed with mandarin orange, which gives a more citrus tone. Making it juicy and tart. The body pepper in the same way with less intensity, but to get to the bottom the tonka bean dominates the fragrance; with a touch of musk and sandalwood providing comfort and creaminess. It’s a very versatile fragrance.
سلام.بوی معمولی داره اصلا خواص نیست بيشترم بوش مجلسيه تا اسپرت.من ورژن اولی رو بیشتر خوشم اومد.اما از لحاظ موندگاري و پخش خیلی خوبه
Chances of spotting someone with this scent is pretty high where I live and often, I couldn't tell the difference between Allure Homme Sport and the Extreme. Chanel Allure Homme Sport is very popular in Singapore, you can find people wearing this to work, in the train, at the airport and in the shopping malls.
Marketing wise, it's a good move to cash in the success of Allure Homme Sport but in terms of value and performance, it's more of the same for me. Also on my skin, I feel the longevity was a bit disappointing but that shouldn't dissuade you to try it out on your skin before you make the purchase. Give it a try, your mileage may vary.
This is sex in a juice. Some girl will really get her senses all sexed up in future, not yet .I have a strong feeling for that. How can a girl dislike it. I think a girl can never forget this smell.
When you do wear it , apply it on neck , arms , wrists , i mean so that girl can smell it as much as she can.
When this happens i will write my third review.
Love this.
I love the dry down. very creamy scent
On my skin it's really really like Dior Homme Sport.
Very very Versatile. Lasts very long in Summer, Spring, Autumn and even in Winter I wear it occasionally.
My 50 ML bottle is almost gone. Will use the rest while flying. Purchased last month a 100 ML.
Really looove the Chanel 100 ML bottles in my hand. Have Bleu-Edition Blanche & Eau Extreme.
Last Summer holiday used Versace pour homme for the evenings, since the sence is about 75% the same.
When travelling light and for a few days a often pick this fragrance for being the most versatile.
This is smooth and has a slightly vanilla and minty drydown with plenty of Tonka, although I found it quite different than lets say Armani Code.
Lasts a good 6-7 hours and has gotten me a variety of compliments from a co-worker, a neighbor and a 2 cute girls working at target and at a local take out place(neither or which would obligated to compliment as part of their job, anyway).
Sillage/projection is quite strong and I am not sure exactly which season this should be most appropriate for. For all intensive purposes, I would say Spring or Fall, though summer evenings could be quite appropriate as well, so overall, it's versatile. Definitely more of an "urban" type fragrance where you don't get the scent of a beach or grassy meadow in this.
Scent 4.5/5
Projection 5/5 (for a "summer" scent, it's heavy)
Longevity 4/5
Compliments 4.5/5
Uniqueness 4/5 (it's not like the other Allure)
Id like to say I think this one should really be tested on skin and not paper. Although some people say the extreme name is misplaced, personally I do feel it has a much more.. Intense, and well ok lets say "extreme" smell on paper. On paper it can actually be kinda off putting because of the thickness of it.
However on skin, its much much better. Sure the name becomes misleading, but its a nice smell so who cares about the name ya know?
Anyway as many others have said im sure, it does smell similar to the original but a much more sweet version. With less citrus and lacking that sorta cleaning detergent sorta smell to it. And obviously none of that pink pepper kick that the original has.
However that being said there is still a bit of freshness here to tingle your nose to add some contrast. But certainly a tonka bomb no doubt. And one of the better tonka bombs in terms of smell as well.
Not particularly sporty but a good smell is a good smell I think. Be sure to try on skin though because well as said I do not think this one smells good on paper or clothes.
سلام. این عطربنظرم اصلا ملایم وسبک نیست بلکه سنگین.تند. و فلفلی کمی شاداب با ماندگاری زیاد است وصد البته بسیار خوشبو
A very smooth, powerful and invigorating scent. As time progresses, the beautiful opening citrus scents are gently overridden by a very athletic sweet tonka bean that clings to the skin for dear life. Lasting longer than most scents, Allure Homme Sport Eau Extreme is perfect for any situation in any season, and could easily be someone's signature fragrance. 8.5/10.
آرامشى كه در عطرهاى شنل هست بدون ترديد در هيچ عطرى نيست.. بشدت دوست داشتنى ، آرام و خوشبو.. خيلى دوسش دارم. ميدونم كه آنچنان قوى نيست اما اينم ميدونم كه وقتى رو پوستم اسپرى ميكنم حس و حالم خوب ميشه، عاليه.
Before giving my opinion I let go one hours .. and I must say it is really worthy of a perfume Chanel. :) I love her because I love opening and the closing (sweeter and "creamy") is a fragrance by the projection moderate, but from the long longevity (about 8 hours on me). Certainly will buy this. One among the best for man of Chanel .. notes are joined with each other so fantastic well done. Council for spring-summer.
Scent: 8.5/10
Longevity: 8/10
Silliage: 7.5/10
Overall: 8.5 / 10.
To be honest I actually bought this one just so I would have all the allures. It never wowed me whenever I tried it at the shop. Anyway after having it for a year or so I need to stress that it is certainly not the weak point that I thought it was in the allure line up. If you are a man who wants to smell good but doesn't know much about quality fragrance, just go buy all the allure edt's and you have it made right there. This extreme one is definitely not extreme in any way. That's probably a bad name for it. Extremely beautiful maybe. It lingers for hours and hours and as with every one of the chanel allure's, people absolutely love it. Disregard the name on the bottle because the fluid inside is as good as it gets!
AHS Extreme is my signature perfume. Simply 9/10.
Simply it's a WOW , smooth , elegant , soft , intimate , masculine and combining freshness with tenderness .
I can detect directly the main 3 ingredients which combined make a magic potion . i enjoy it when i smell it on myself but cannot be easily detected on me by others even for that i think it doens't fit to my skin in term of sillage , Tonka is like Vanilla , always it has the power of " Yes I am Here " .
Merci Jaques Polge .
Doha 12.02.2015
I'm going to sound contradictory in this statement. I like it because I'm a fan of Tonka, but I don't like it because it's only Tonka.
At the beginning there is some orange but the Tonka quickly comes out within seconds, and it's a sticky, syrupy Tonka, not even the smooth kind.
How this can be considered anywhere near a "sport" fragrance is beyond me. I don't go by seasons, but I sure wouldn't pick 'summer' as the first season that would come to my mind with this.
If you're looking for just a sticky sweet Tonka fragrance, check this one out. If you want this to go by the usual definition of 'sport' and be, well... Sporty, then look the other way.
I like how the most picked season for this fragrance is in summer, I almost feel like it's a psychological thing. The advertising and name makes you think of a summer fragrance, but I bet if you put this exact fragrance in a "noir" fragrance, everyone would put it as winter..
@kitti90 You sound like an ESL teenage girl. "Oh, every Chanel is for McDonald's workers." Well, guess what bud? I don't see any niche in your wardrobe. Going off your profile, you look like a broke fast food worker. Grow up, little boy.
This is yet another fragrance that I use exclusively for the clubs and bars, I like it a lot.
It projects like a beast and the scent will get you noticed.
This scent says “sit tight boys we are going to have a fun time.”
Scent: 7/10
Longevity: 5/10
Silliage: 5.5/10
Jury Verdict: 7/10
i love extreme versions, but this fragrance has nothing in common to the original that is a fantastic eau de toilette. i dont like this fragrance very much, someone loves it and someone hates it. the scent is not pleasant to my nose, i selled it after few weeks. but i have to say that this is a real extreme fragrance, projection is heavy and lasts for many hours on the skin and it's always better than 1 million, the worst fragrance in the world. grazie.
The only Chanel cologne, actually it has the "eau de parfum"label on the back of the bottle, worth having since the loss of Antaeus, Egoiste and Allure.
It does have sillage and is not sporty at all ( which is a good thing for me).
I nevertheless miss oldschool Antaeus, the mighty beast turned into a tamed puppy....
To my nose it doesn't smell like the Original Allure Homme Sport. The extreme version has a prominent mint note, the orange is very subdued, while the pepper and tonka bean are stronger. Eau Extreme can be worn during the winter and spring. It has good longevity - 7-8 hours with good projection during the first 3 hours.
I can't get enough of this. When I first got it, I thought it was ok. The more I wear it, the more I love it. Amazing. There is more here than you might think at first.
This scent is what you expect from chanel a masterpiece.The ladies love smelling it on me. fresh and clean.I love it very much.easy to use and my favorite. next to Bleu de Chanel this is one of the best.overall 10/10.try it you'll love it..
Highly praised, impossible someone around you not notice ... stronger than the Allure Sport with great projection and fixing 12 hours. 10/10
Allure is a sweet cologne, I can even call it safe and one of my personal favorites. I don't like the longevity though, i think it fades off really fast but i rate it highly especially as a weekend scent.
This is a fragrance that needs approximately 15 minutes to develop on your skin. In the first minutes it's not that good it's a bit sharp and the pepper needs to fade away, but after that it develops as an amazing fresh and sexy scent.
It's an absolute compliment getter. Its a fragrance for mature people. Not for the young one million crowd.
After having used the original AHS regularly in the past, I needed to try out this stuff and boy, I didn't regret it a second! Gets me tons of compliments, my GF loves it, projects superbly (at least 4 hours strong projection) and the longevity is pretty good (on my skin).
Tried out several popular fragrances in the store, but this one really stands out for me! You can definately get the high quality Allure DNA out of it, I even prefer its scent over Bleu de Chanel, so it will stay in my collection for a long time.
If you need a great versatile fragrance, all seasons, all occassions, and you like the Allure Homme Sport series, this is a must-buy!

Yes there's a lot of tonka in the beginning, yes this can be overpowering from initial spray blah blah blah. You gotta wait for the dry down with this one because in the dry down that is where its freshness begins and brightens. The dry down is like the mid of the original AHS where I really pick up the mandarin orange and the musk.
Just be patient with this one and wait for the dry down. I'm currently wearing it in summer and will be wearing this in winter too, only 1 spray is required.
It projects, lasts, smells good and receive plenty of compliments. That is all i require in a fragrance and this one does exactly that.
I"m new to fragrances, but it just reminds me of armani code when I first wore it from the sample sprayer.
I live in a cold climate and let me say this is pure magic in terms of longevity and compliments. I see it as a night version of AHS and in that regard it is b.e.a.utiful! I don't think it gets nearly enough love and between this,sport and blanche (all of which I have) this has become my favorite of the three. If I lived somewhere warmer things would be different but in a climate where it is below zero (Celsius) 7 months out of the year, this is the allure to have no question. Beautiful combination of fruit, spice and smooth soft tonka. Perfect for a snowy winter night with the fire going sitting around the christmas tree with an egg nog and spiced rum :)
Overpriced, but elegant.
Arguably one of the safest scent to wear I almost get chewing a mouthful of 'almonds' sensation I prefer allure homme sport Edt better but this is a crowd pleaser for fall/winter.

You will definitely get compliments for the first 3 hours, smells rich to other people, even though it smells just good to me.
It's the fall/winter version of AHS. The Tonka/mint combo really stands out in the drydown. It's a very likeable scent that can be worn by women as well. Longevity and silage are good with this. If you are craving vanilla/Tonka then check this out.
Post Script: If you have to compare CAHSEE to something, then compare it to Versace Eros, but in reverse (tonka over mint instead of mint over tonka) and without the vanilla. If I had to pick between the two I would take VE without hesitation, but maybe that is like comparing green apples to mandarin oranges!
I'm not sure I really understand all the preceding comparisons to other "Allures", I mean, why bother? CAHSEE has barely anything in common with any of them beyond the interlocking "C"s on the top of the cap and the name "Chanel Allure". When I pick up the beautiful, masculine, silvery gray flask I really feel like I am holding something as solid as a waxed surfboard, and when I spray it on my skin the luxuriousness of it rolls over me like the crest of a wave. CASHEE manages to produce a cooling, oceanic effect without the use of aquatics, seaweed or calone. If the naming of things is important to you then remember the key word here is “Extreme”. Admittedly, the tonka and Sicilian orange are disproportionate in the beginning, but just before they become a cloying mist the mint, cedar, sage and cypress seem to rescue them and then figure into the unraveling of the scent across the breadth of my skin, which gives CASHEE a reassuring quality. The balsamic notes also give CASHEE an ambiguity which other tonka fragrances lack. When this climate-controlled wave of accords begins to subside you become aware of the pepper, sandalwood and musk which give the whole composition a mild aromatic warmth and opulence. Cooling then warmimg. It seems very "Chanel" to me.
Yes, I think CASHEE is the most alluring of all the “Allures” and has far more projection than, say, Bleu de Chanel. This has been proven to me over and over by strangers who ask what I am wearing with a smile of delight on their faces, but I feel more delightful myself for having worn it. This balmy breeze that rolls over me seems to have a lasting force the other “Allures” do not, in my opinion, possess. Chanel is always a bit ahead of the curve conceptually and I think it shows in CASHEE’s trending out of aquatic sport fragrance and into a more sophisticated body cocktail.. After the first few sprays, I just want to sniff it more. I even decided to write this review to figure out why it makes me feel that way.
Perhaps Chanel isn't known for being "sporty", but beyond the sexy surfer in the ads or the fact that I probably wouldn't wear this to the gym, I discovered that if I really wanted to I could spray CAHSEE on after a swim in a sparkling blue pool or 30 minutes on the elliptical machine and it would do me only good. (OK, I've done it.) Voila! You see, it was a bit sporting of Chanel to have created something like this after all.
I had the Allure Homme Sport in the past and currently own the Extreme version. The Extreme version is more heavy with tonka bean, almost a gourmand scent in my nose. As it brother AHS, this is more suitable in non hot days.
I own both this and the original Allure Homme Sport. This fragrance is a longevity and silage monster. My friend sprayed it on himself and I could still smell this four hours later around 6 feet away. This is a very versatile sweet/ powdery scent perfect for going to clubs, bars, or out to eat with friends. I get more compliments with this scent than any other fragrance in my arsenal, and the best part is the fact that nobody else will have it. I don't like the scent anywhere near that of AHS, but everyone else's nose seems to think differently. Also, this is potent! I've put shirts through the washer that I wore out and they still smell like this when they come out. If you like the scent or want a "going out" version of AHS, I'd recommend this even if you have the original!
Pros:
Versatile
Unique
Gets a ton of compliments
Very good sillage and longevity
Cons:
Scent isn't as good as the original AHS
Not really sporty past the opening, could be cloying in warm weather
This is a clone of the original Allure Homme Sport. However, the vanilla is more pronounced in this and the woods seem to stick out to me. I purchased this because I owned the original at one time but got bored with it & besides the fact the it was/is so common. I gave up on it. I have gotten to the point where I do not want to smell like EVERYONE else WHERE EVER I go.
With that being said, this last on my skin six hours with average to strong projection in the beginning. After about 2 hours, I am left with a orange/vanillsh wood type smell that is not unpleasant, but it is synthetic. Chanel normally makes good fragrances, but this I am afraid to my nose is a average offering marketed towards the younger crowed. There is nothing wrong with that, but it is not for me. I will say I do prefer this over the original, but when it comes to Chanel's frags marketed for men, I will stick with the likes of Antaeus & Egoiste! Grown up stuff!
Compliments galore. Every time I wear this I would at least get one compliment, it's DAMN SEXY! Just trust me on this, girls and women LOVE this. Tonka blast, yes. But it's a nice masculine aroma once it settles down just after a few moments. The scent trail is what's so sexy, walk by a female and she'll think you're a God.
I honestly give this a 9.5 on the scent, I'm still amazed at how this smells, a sexy, masculine aroma. This projects really well for the first hour and about an arms length as it dies down. Chanel sprayers are huge so 3 sprays is perfect, one on the chest, one behind each ear, and you're set.
10/10 on versatility, perfect for any occasion. This is the only fragrance that I know of that's labeled as a sport fragrance that should not be used in high heat, I can seriously see someone getting a headache using this in the summer. Autumn and winter weather, this is amazing for those climates.
What is my *first* olfactory impression? Great copy of 'Black Caviar' ('Paris Elysées'). It's just what I'm talking right now. I feel somehow - cheated; since the BC costs, here in Brazil, R$ 45,00 and this Chanel cost me R$ 202,00, almost five times more expensive! In short, the quality of the copies of 'Paris Elysées' has been confirmed. Is it possible to interpret this 'Chanel' as the 'French Armani Code'? Yes. An 'Armani Code' more citrus and more alive.
Scent: 8/10 (good). Longevity: 8/10 (7-8 hours). Sillage: 8/10 (good). Quality: 8/10 (good).
Totally agree with @Marciu (although I love @Juiceman 0331's reviews), Allure Homme Sport, Bleu EdT, Platinum Egoiste... Currently they're all watered down versions of their former selves.
I don't know if it's IFRA messing up almost every fragrance that came out before the new restrictions or companies using cheaper ingredientes for making the most out of their succesful fragrances once they've become top sellers, or a mix of both, but the thing is that currently it's getting more and more difficult to get what you pay for in terms of quality. Whether you buy a new release made with new ingredient restrictions in mind or go for higher concentration more expensive fragrances without the scent evaporating in two hours and becoming a skin scent after 20 minutes.
@Juiceman 0331 - "Chanel doesn't do stunts like re formulation to make their fragrances less better and less appealing to consumers." - you gotta be kidding me. Chanel is the first house to fool customers, reformulate the fragrance and then pretend that nothing has happened.
It smells like almond milk.
Hello everyone,
When everybody thinking about Chanel it seems to pass Eau Extreme. And I can't understand why. It's a well-blended high quality approach to a sexier Sporty scent, which makes it unique. OK it is not my favorite Chanel but is certainly an underrated one. Sweet and warm for a sport scent, creamy tonka being fresher by citruses.
If you wanna go Chanel and unique in the same time, give it a try!
Scent: 6,5/10
Quality:8/10
Projection: Perfect for a cooler weather.
Longevity: 8 Solid hours.
Chanel doesn't do stunts like re formulation to make their fragrances less better and less appealing to consumers. I am pretty sure that most of us have experienced having our favorite colognes re formulated for the worse by big houses such as YSL and Gucci.
They don't discontinue fragrances that consumers actually enjoy.
They don't have inconsistency with their batches, unlike Creed and YSL.
These are from my own experiences and some people might have experienced something different from their time.
Now, let me tell you guys about my experience with Allure HS Eau Extreme.
I moved from San Francisco to the Phillipines last year, so it has been hard for me to use cold weather colognes here because it's a tropical country, but my Chanel collection has been great in this type if climate.
I use all my other Allure's during daytime, except for Eau Extreme which is exclusive for night time only. Why? Because of the prominent tonka beans, which smells sweet like vanilla, but not cloying or sticky sweet.
The other Chanel that I use for night time is Bleu De Chanel, because of it's incense scent, which I find nauseating during daytime.
All the Chanels I own have great silage, more than arms length and the longevity for all of them are about 6 hours. After 6 hours, they become closer to skin, but people can still smell it if their standing very close to me.
It's very hard to go wrong with Chanel and you can buy them blind, with very little worries that you're not going to like it.
Would I buy them all again when I run out? Yes!
My rating for Eau Extreme is 10/10
@pjd1234 - Chanel Allure Edition Blanche is not (and never has been) discontinued.
okay so ive been wearing this for a while now. first of all they should bring back "edition blanche" now that's yummy. My experience with extreme is not quit pleasant I do like the opening very citrusy but when the pepper kicks in I just cant bear with it. They should have made the pepper as a backround instead of a dominating note then with the dry down peeper mixes with Tonka bomb its not pleasant to me and the price?? not so appealing a pass for me unfortunately on this one.
Not so appealed by this fragrance first time. But my girl friend loves it ! So I tested again and again, and yes, this has become my daily/night fragrance. Very good longevity and sillage (not too strong but smelly just as much as needed)!
Easy to wear, no headache maker, finally that is a good fragrance!
riffjim4069? dont put cologne on your sack!!! I said your neck lol.
Tonka,mint, and citrus that doesn't resemble Allure Homme Sport. by tonka bean I mean this is a tonka bomb. There's another new fragrance that's less expensive, smells better, projects better, lasts longer, and is also a tonka bomb. That fragrance is Versace Eros. Don't waste $70 plus dollars on this garbage when you can buy Eros and anything else in the Allure line that is much better than this crap.
One word CHANEL.
Top of the designer era. All occasion fragrance.
Is it a tonkabomb?..yes, but in a very lovely way.
I've tried lots of frags as U, but just Dior and Chanel have never disappointed me yet.
This is a must have one.

Allure Home Sport Eau Extrême is a wonderful manly scent for the day time and for all seasons that lasts a long time and has (in my view) a moderate to heavy silage. I love the complex composition with amongst other strong citrus, tonka beans and powdery notes. I only do not understand the Chanel reference to 'sport'? I would never spray this fragrance on when sporting as it would simply overpower. It is a scent I imagine a lot of men may like and you cannot go wrong with it. Absolutely a modern Chanel masterpiece that is worth spending your money on. Please try it!
Of the 3 Allure Sports, this one is my least favorite but I do enjoy it quite a bit. It's quite different from the others - as the previous reviwer said, I cannot pick out any notes other than the tonka.
Very versatile - ideal for work, perfect for night out, great for casual wear. Perfect in any weather. Lasts all day long (8-12) but is a skin scent for me almost from the start - same with the other allure sports. I tend to over apply to compensate so I tend to go through them fast. No harm, thoroughly enjoyable.
The one thing that bothers me is the extreme name which is somewhat misleading - I find nothing extreme or intense about it - more of a sibling to the other allure sports than a souped up version.
Allure Homme Sport Extreme is a spiced up version of Allure Homme Sport, with the added addition of a noteable layer of tonka bean extract and perhaps the trim down of the citrus portion.
All in all, I greatly enjoyed this scent, although it seemed quite 'busy and complex'. When you first spray this, it is very confusing until the dry down hits. There are multiple notes all flying at you at once, and if your nose is like mine you will go about trying to isolate some of these. It is practically impossible until it dries down and becomes more recognizable.
Once it calms on your skin (after 10-15 mins) you will recognize many of the original notes in AHS, along with the tonka bean that was added for extra effect within the INTENSE version. It is quite pleasant, while still making this scent quite complex.
I believe it lasted a good 6+ hours on my skin, with the remaining 2+ hours sitting as a skin scent. The projection was quite good for the first 2-3 hours, while subtly dying down after to a weaker sillage.
Spray recommendations: one on the chest, two on the neck, and possibly one on each arm. This scent is gentle enough that it will not overpower everyone around with extra sprays.
Buy, try or pass? Definitely TRY. If you liked AHS, then you will most likely enjoy this one as well, but the added notes differentiate it just enough to make it its own scent, apart from the original sport flanker.
Longevity: 7/10 (6-8+ hours)
Projection: 6/10 (Good for first three hours, then calmed down)
Versatility: 8/10 (Anytime! Any season, especially spring/ fall)
Smell: 7/10 (Good smell- a bit complex and bold)
i think it is one of the most compliment fragrance in my collection .

I'm surprised so many people see this as an acceptable
summer fragrance. Anything with this much Tonka is best used in fall and winter IMHO. I have to admit that I never even attempted to wear this in spring so maybe it works in the heat but I'd be surprised.
@panoulis1992 It's an all rounder, day night summer winter whenever. :)
Allure Homme Sport Eau Extreme smells a lot different from the original Homme Sport. It is a Tonka-heavy fragrance -- powerful with a pretty good longevity. Its freshness comes from the minty opening with mild citruses, but overall, it has the same powdery vibe as Code Ultimate by Armani.
Performance is above-average compared to other designer colognes in the market. I wore this a lot in the summer of 2012, and it gave me a solid 5-6 hours power-punch projection before it decreases its strength. A very good scent for the price.
Not too impressed. This thing is TONKA BOMB... It's like Allure Sport got half emptied and then half filled with tonka extract. Too much dang tonka!
I agree with the comment with a lot of balloons below me. When you think AHSEE, think the original AHS but with the tonka amped up a million percent. This is literally a tonka bomb. Im a huge fan of the original AHS but i find that this has too much tonka in it for my liking and, coming from someone who generally enjoys tonka, that's saying something. AHSEE has great projection and I can see it getting a lot of compliments but, from a personal standpoint, i find this fragrance would have been more to my liking had it been a little less 'extreme'.
This is one of the better perfumes that Chanel offered men in recent years. On my skin it is a very well composed scent that has a certain character for itself and smells really nice.
On me this scent is more on the side of warm (e.g. Tonka/ Musk) and Cypress notes; and I don't get the link between what I smell and the image that Chanel chose for it: a surfer...the ocean...and the waves?!! In other words, I don't think of this scent as a 'fresh', 'oceanic' and 'sporty' thing. On my skin it is a scent that can be easily worn on a dining occasion!
Maybe its just my chemistry, but it seems like the fashion houses try to market even warm romantic scents with a 'sporty' and 'fresh' image, with the expectation of attracting more young customers.
Very good projection and longevity. Overall: 7 out of 10.
This was my first flanker to try of the Chanel Allure line.
All I can think of is Lemon and Cream.
Extreme, sure enough. This is probably the first scent which made me nauseous upon full wearing.
Probably among the minority here, but I cannot recommend this to anyone.
All the negativity, claims of unoriginality, and misled expectations aside, Allure Sport Eau Extreme is a very good offering from the house of Chanel. Though the criticisms against Eau Extreme do hold some merit (not being extreme enough or being too close to the original Allure and its Sport flanker), one needs to appreciate this for what it is and not what it was expected to be.
A great mix of tonka sweetness and citrus freshness accompanied by light sprinkles of pepper and mint to round it all out. People claim this to be uninspired, although that may be so, the fragrance is what it is and what it is, is a really good creamy citrus fragrance, probably the best only challenged by its lighter brother, Edition Blanche. And it still doesn't change the quality of the blend, which is more than excellent.
Not to mention the intense staying power this has, 10-12 hours easily. Projection and sillage are very good. The people you leave in your wake will be delighted to pick up on a shinku-hadouken-like scent trail. Speaking of which, this is a compliment monster. I have a handful of fragrances I prefer much more than Eau Extreme, but people of all ages seem to adore the scent, which is always a plus.
What I like best about this is its process. Though possessing a linear ride, it switches from being a citrus fresh fragrance to a tonka sweet one within 3-4 hours, which makes for a perfect spring or fall fragrance when the day starts out hot and the night brings in the cold. Don't be fooled by all the hate. Go and try this for yourself, it might just delightfully surprise you like it did me.
****
Forgot how nice this is. Loaded on Tonka with a citrus/pepper blast initially. All is well with this one including sillage/longevity. Not the most original but it fits right in with the other flankers. Perfect for cool weather.
I really enjoy this one.
It perform amazingly well. I go with 2 spray(One on each side of the neck) and i get a nice sillage and literally a full day long longevity.
Quite versatile: Spring/summer night, cloudy/rainy spring days, and mainly fall/winter day.
And despite all the negative comments, i get more compliments with the one than Platinum egoiste :/
Revisit on this one:
So I do actually get the mint and tonka bean, but they are so faint and they barely last 10 minutes on me. Overall, the term "extreme" is completely contradicting at least for my skin. This lasts on me a maximum of 3 hours and that's in 75 degree heat. Also, I bought this from Macy's, so I know it's not a fake. I had the original allure home sport before and it lasted about 10 hours on me. This "extreme" version is really a sweeter and lighter version of the original. I will be returning this, and possibly exchange it for something else, probably Bleu De Chanel or Versace Eros. I just got a sample of Eros and damn it smells good, but it may be too strong to wear in the heat.
I have owned this for over a year and I am officially switching my status from "like" to "love."
Sprayed this on a tester strip and it did smell similar to what the notes describe, tonka bean, citrus, mint, etc. but when I got home and sprayed it on my arm, all I get is pepper. I'll be returning this for sure.
Mirip seperti CAHS pada top notes tapi dgn base yg lebih sweet dengan tonka bean yg kental. Lebih pas di gunakan pada malam hari. Great fragrance!
It starts citrusy like a typical summer sport scent, but this one seems to have higher quality ingredients than most of the other designer fragrances out there. So I find the higher price reasonable. After 20 minutes the sweet aromatic notes (maybe tonka bean) come into play and they are really strong. It makes the scent smell more like a winter perfume although the opening was sporty and fresh. Really interesting combination and development. This one lasts long and has good sillage. One spray was enough for me. It smells expensive and alluring.
I agree tonka yumminess!
I just love,love this fragrance so much regardless of the negative comments,i find it very sexy and "yummy" !
True,the "sport" word written on the bottle doesn't fit the juice.It's not sporty but it smells amazing none the less.
It's classy,warm,creamy,sweet,clean.
It opens with a fresh sharp citrusy-minty note, like AHS and later it becomes warm and creamy and the tonka beans kick in!
On the dry down it reminds me a bit Bleu de Chanel.
It can be worn anytime,anywhere and it is fresh enough so it can be worn during summer.Bottom line it is a versatile fragrance!
It is long lasting(8+ on my skin ) and it projects heavy on the first hour or so,than it settles down a bit.
Overall it's a great quality fragrance like all Chanel are,on the down side it's kinda expensive in my country,110 Euro in retail @ Douglas Perfumes
If you like AHS you will like this one too,it's AHS with the tonka notes boosted up and it can be worn by anyone,anytime!
I really like this fragrance, very nice.
سلام.گرون بود ولی خریدمش .این عطر رو اسپری کنید تا حسی بهتون دست بده که به سندباد دست میداد البته وقتی غول چراغ بیرون میاومد.
Chanel hosts some of my favorite fragrances of all time.
But I do not like this version of Allure Sport.
At all, but that's just me.
People can complain about how many flankers Chanel puts out all they want. My honest opinion is that Chanel makes the best flankers out there, and most of them could stand on their own. This "extreme" version of Allure Homme Sport may be portrayed wrong by the title. I will agree the naming of this scent is off, but I'm reviewing the fragrance, not the name. Allure Homme sport is a wonderful fragrance, but on my skin it didn't last as long as I wanted it to, even though it does last longer than most summer fragrances. Eau Extreme is the answer to that problem, atleast for me. It takes the best elements from Allure Homme Sport and adds more tonka bean to give it a more mature, deeper scent. This combination of citrus and heavy tonka is blended wonderfully to create a long lasting scent that will please most if not all who come in contact with it. It's strong enough for the colder months, yet still light enough to wear in the spring/summer. This makes it versatile and well deserving of being a signature scent for someone just to wear all the time. It's perfect for a date night, or wherever you work on a daily basis. I don't get all the criticism, which I'm aware that people have different likes and dislikes when it comes to fragrances, but sometimes I think people expect or demand too much, all while not even knowing what it is they're demanding. This is a great, manly fragrance that will please people. End of story.
I think this a really great fragrance that you can't really go wrong wearing. There is however some truth to what the guy below me said about it being Armani Code Ultimate in a different bottle. I'm assuming he meant Ultimate and not Code original, Ultimate has the Tonka that creates the similarity. Tonka is everywhere these days in Mens fragrances and is played out at this point but this is still a serious compliment-getter that I never regret wearing, I'm just tired of gourmands in general and creamy tonka in particular. Still a very successful flanker with tons of sillage and longevity.
I love this fragrance. If I were a man, I would definitely buy this one or Allure Homme Sport version for myself. Maybe both of them:)
They are not very different, just a bit different, but both of them smells very good and attractive. Both of them are TOO PERFECT for a man.
When I smell this one and Allure Home Sport, I get a wet cool metalic sense which I love for.
I don't like very spicy fragrances both on men and women, because it makes me feel that someone is trying to be sexy by wearing a fragrance. But, both this and Sport one are creating an image who is very cool, confident and sure very attractive.
smells very strong in the opening with a blast of citrus and pepper. the opening gives it the "sporty" name.
the mid/base smells like a creamy Tonka bean or chocolate.
last 8-10 hrs easily and projection is quite nice.
another quality fragrance by Chanel. pure class.
I don't like it. I think it's the worst Chanel male fragrance (but 10 years ago, as a young man in his early twenties, i might have loved it...it's not a bad scent)
This works the best on a warm summer night. So, at least, this might be the first evening/going out scent from Chanel since the original Egoiste.
It's time for Chanel to release a more daring nighttime scent. 2008 (AHEB), 2010 (Bleu), 2012 (AHSEE)....2014 ??? Bleu Intense? Noir de Chanel?
My staple is allure homme the original daddy of them all but I do wear this on cold nights out and it's a compliment getter for sure. When i'm asked what im wearing I simply say 'Chanel' and that just about says it all Quality house.
This can also be worn during daytime, but I prefer the Original Allure first, Edition Blanche second and Allure Sport third.
You can't go wrong if you want to buy any of the 4 Allures, because they're all great colognes.
I always get compliments from all the Allures.
I would always pick the House of Chanel over Gucci,YSL, and Dior. They love discontinuing and reformulating fragrances that we already love.
They have a bad habit of fixing something that's not broken.
Yes, Chanel have done reformulations also in the past, but in my own opinion they reformulate to make it better.
I have never tried any of their releases from the early 90's, but as of right now I will always have a place in my drawer for all the 4 Allures and Bleu de Chanel. Great fragrances for the money and worth buying again if I run out in the future.
My overall rating 9/10
I wanted so badly to love this one since I really like Allure Homme Sport but alas! After numerous wearings I must concede that it doesn't perform well on my skin. I've worn it a few times where I experienced what wesleyhclark described as a "pissy...note" (Thought my nose was playing tricks on me so I'm glad that someone else also perceived it).
Performance on me also isn't great either. After about an hour I have to bury my nose into my forearm to smell it. It's close to the original but not as fresh because of the tonka which darkens it's character making it more wearable at night than the original. To me it doesn't smell as refined as AHS and apart from the magnified tonka note, smells too close to AHS to have a personality of it's own.
I don't even think this should have been a "sport" offering. It seems incomplete as is and confused somewhat. I would have preferred that they maintained the AHS DNA, work on longevity and projection and darken it some more by playing with notes like tobacco, incense, vanilla (with a smoky quality) and oud until they had something really worth selling.
I'd also call it something like Allure by Night or something less corny. Given the current oud craze I won't be surprised if they did create a flanker centered around that note.
RIght, Allure homme tonka...the original sport adding tonka...this tonka beans are very very popular in our days in perfumes....creamy perfumes..male colognes and female perfumes are getting closer in the 21rst century.
It's onerous for me to grasp your loathing of this scent. I find it uniquely enticing. I'm currently going on 21 hours after the application of 2 sprays and I can still smell it as if I applied it 2-3 hours ago. I'm currently analyzing it to see if I would like to buy it for myself and I can honestly say that it has more than reached the mark of my utmost expectation. My signature scent is Mont Blanc "Legend," but I can see this scent as a prodigious choice for the upcoming spring/summer season. I understand that most reviews are extremely subjective and will likely be based on their own skin type/senses, but AHSEE has proven to be utterly harmonious with my skin. Happy fragrance hunting!
scent: 9/10
Silage: 8/10
Longevity: 10/10
I agree with the reviewer below me, it should have the Tonka name attached to it, because after 10 minutes, that's all I smell. It's just kind of a sweet powdery mess and not sporty at all. Not really sure if a lot of thought and work went into this one. If you like Allure Homme Sport, like I do, just stick with that one. Chances are you're going to like it more if not, the same.
I'm rather neutral about this one.
Not sporty or really fresh by any means. It could be called "Allure Homme Tonka Extreme"
It's Allure Homme Sport without Aldehydes and Tonka amped up to the max. Overall it's less fresh than Sport but it doesn't have the depth and complexity of the original Allure Homme.
It's a very linear scent without much development. Citrus top, Tonka all the way through and a hint of pepper and musk.
It's inoffensive, can be worn almost anytime and most people will like it. It reminds me a lot of a slightly fresher Armani Code. Mass-marketable and pleasing to most noses.
Projection and Longevity are good and scent is okay.
Not a bad fragrance but nothing i would buy because it's rather bland.
I like this as a simple casual scent not necessarily sporty. I think it will go good as a work scent or a daytime running around scent...
This does not smell sporty to me. I could see it as a versatile fragrance for any season, and for any occasion, from work day to date nights. I prefer it over the original allure homme and allure homme sport. The first blast is citrusy and spicy, and this lasts a good while. the tonka beans add a pleasant note as well. This is a pretty safe scent, however. You will smell good, but probably wont get the reaction of something more unique and daring.
I had some initial misgivings about this scent. For one thing how on earth can a sporty cologne possibly have tonka in its notes pyramid. I mean come on now how can that ever work. Then I looked at the ad campaign and laughed to myself, are they ovestating just a tad with the use of Maverick size waves in the ad copy. I was wrong on both counts as this a most clever use of tonka along with some stellar ingredients to evoke the raw deep power of the natural elements. It works and is possibly one of the most seriously modern masculines in the fragrance world. Depth and complexity beyond par. This is all about natural male charisma. Raw, rugged , handsome and magnetic. A scent that changes with the seasons. Wear this in summer and you will notice mint and mandarin defining its very own personality that underline how good this fragrance really is. 9/10. One of my all time favorties. Enjoy !
Am I the only one who likes this fragrance? Don't care what none of yol say ima stick with this one, I get excellent silage and longevity. Also love the loads of Tonka this one has.
8/10
Good projection and long lasting, simple elegant and formal more than casual.
OK, I guess I have to change what I've written some time ago, unfortunately.
This fragrance is full of contrasts, IMO. There are fresh notes at the beggining - mint is really nice here. But then it's getting only sweeter in time. Mandarin orange is detectable and it gives a kind of fruitiness, but not sourness! And when the drydown comes - it's done. Tonka all the way. You can't feel anything else, at least I can't. Sweet vanilla-almond tonka and that's it.
Comparing it to original Allure Homme Sport - well, Extreme looks bland... It smells rather like a mix of Chanel Allure Homme and Jean Paul Gaultier's Le Male to my nose.
Longevity and sillage are very good though. I get easily 10 hours with 3-4 sprays.
If you're looking for a solid (and common) winter fragrance - go ahead and try this one. If you're looking for something new - I'd suggest to pass on this one and search somewhere else...
Nice fragrance women like it I gotten several compliments since wearing it for about 3 months to me this is not a summer scent although it says sport it's better suited for cool spring days or fall winter it smells like a heavier version of allure sport (silver bottle) allure sport is a little better but this one is still good it's for cooler weather longevity is good too around 8 to 9 hours it'll get you through a full work day which is good enough
Most Chanel scents are 'safe' and likeable, but also unique and of high quality. As i smell this one on my arm it is not unique at all, smells like a typical diesel or calvin klein scent. Quite boring and uninspiring
I can't see the similarities between this one and the original Allure except they are both masterpiece. This one is chocolaty, the original one is more mature.
Allure Homme Sport Eau Extreme begins with a minty, sweet scent. The mandarin orange provides a fresh vibe to the composition as it settles. The tonka, mint, and pepper commingle into a warm spiciness that is accompanied vestigially by wood and musk.
This fragrance is invigorating yet tempered. It is not loud, but when tested contemporaneously with others, it stood out and was well-received. It's a well-made, unobtrusive, slightly sweet, and spicy perfume that pleasantly surprised many of the sales associates with the way it worked with my skin. Most men will tell you that this perfume is unremarkable, and I would agree. However, the noses of these lovely ladies don't lie!
Really heavy on the Tonka bean...but that's alright with me.
Now all of the Allure range use elements of the originals DNA but focusing in different areas. I think it's a credit to Chanel that they release such expertly blended flankers which don't really allow for criticism... they're just good!
It must be the creamy combo of tonka, sandlewood and cedar or something that gives the Allure range in general its signature as well as the fruit/citrus in the top.
Speaking of fruit... I didn't identify the mandarin note at first because it's against such an unfamiliar background (usually light & musky)
You get fruit/citrus straight away but because of the Allure signature it makes you think of lemons (edition Blanche) it's only when I delved deep in that I got the orangey flavour and to me it's very pronounced and lasts long into the drydown.
I know pepper is listed here but I don't get masses of it.
Another note not listed is Amber to me an amber accord is present in the drydown.
This is a well realized composition like all Chanel fragrances and especially the Allures. My favourite has to be the original but this is a close second and I love the summery, lemon meringue juice, that is Edition Blanche too.
Best from the line of Allure after the original Allure

BUY IT AND HAVE A GOOD DAY
Got this for my husband for a birthday gift. Its just an intoxicating scent I just want to keep sniffing him all day !! LOL
Well, actually, according to Chanel site's info, it's one of two Allure Homme that are made in EDT Concentree versions only (along with Allure Homme Edition Blanche).
After many tests I can say it smells less synthetic and harsh than Allure Homme Sport, maybe because it doesn't contain the aldehydes, don't know...
But all in all I'd say it's a simpler(and stronger) version of Allure Homme (the one from 1999), kind of Allure for younger crowd (late teenagers up to late 20's let's say), because of gourmand side of it. It has definitely better sillage and longevity than Allure. However, I'd choose Allure over Sport Extreme, because stronger doesn't always mean better...
I have bought this a while ago, it smells really good! But it isnt that longlasting on my skin :(
I would recommend using Allure Extreme during summer nights instead of daytime because of the sweetness from the tonka beans.
I get compliments from this cologne and a must have if you collect colognes. You can't go wrong with this one. The regular Allure Sport and Edition Blanche is more suited for daytime wear. Bleu de Chanel is also great for summer nights.
My overall rating 9/10
Just bought it today...well i think not the very sporty one and i prefer the original one as in sport side but still not as bad as i see the comments here....i think its ok just donot expect a lot .... kewl
Smelled good going on but after about twenty minutes it began to take on a pissy, acrid, sour note on my arm.
Surprise! After a few hours everything sort of modulated and that edge went away and it smelled good. But, no, I can't deal with that middle section.
I don't care for this, and it reinforces my opinion that most "sport" scents aren't for me.
I really like this one! I pretty much like all of the Allure line, they all seem to resemble one another somewhat, but have noticeable (if not subtle) differences. This one is a little spicier, more masculine, and less sweet than some of the others in the "Sport" line, though.
Chanel Allure Sport Extreme projects well and has good longevity, and also seems to respond better to warm weather than to cooler weather. Perhaps that's where the "Sport" comes in, since otherwise I would agree with everyone that says that it really isn't a "Sport" fragrance. It is a compliment getter, since I've received more compliments with this one than of any other fragrance here lately.
Overall, this one is really nice and definitely did not disappoint me. It's very versatile as well.....I found myself reaching for this more than any other fragrance this past summer. I have no problem recommending it to anyone looking for a good fragrance that works well in warmer weather and in both casual and formal settings.
don't let yourself be misguided by the sport in the name always an allegory for "watered down flanker of..", this juice is huge and in the same line with Allure Blanche, citrusy opening and a final curtain of vanilla and tonke definitely sexy and well down in a world of overpriced rubbish this juice stands up.. a good 8 out of ten!
While definitely the most underrated male Chanel, Allure Homme Sport Eau Extreme is possibly the best fragrance for men that house has ever made (or "extremely" close to it). The best part about that statement, is that so few people will agree me. I don't really care either. So long as my girlfriend feels the way I do, that's just fine with me. She finds this scent TO DIE FOR and, I should add, better smelling than any other male fragrance by Chanel. Simple, classy, elegant, soft, refined, restrained, and perfect for absolutely ANY season, occasion, or situation. CAHSEE has become my signature scent. It speaks volumes without saying too much... and it does exactly what it should do (smell marvelous) regardless of its dubious marketing as an "Extreme" version of a "Sport" fragrance (neither one of which, it is). Powdery, creamy, mandarin oranges, mingle with tonka beans, the slightest freshness of mint and a deep musk. While far from being revolutionary, it also doesn't smells like any other scent out there. I find it funny that people feel this fragrance reminds them of Allure Homme "Sport". Hint: It DOESN'T!!! I should mention, however, that many people who endorse Chanel fragrances don't sniff too far past the "C". Allure Sport Eau Extreme isn't sporty at all, unless a powdery, creamy orange scent is the definition of "sporty". More like "elegant" and "timeless", perhaps. My only faint qualm with this fragrance is that while it projects like a monster at first, it only does so for 3-4 hours max, although after that, it dries down to a beautiful, citric-tonka infused skin scent for another eight hours or so. Put this on before a romantic evening with your partner and you'll be glad you did. Wear this any time, anywhere. Wear this before playing tennis or lifting weights, however, and well... you don't own any other "sport fragrances", do you?
Overall: 9.5/10 Everyday elegance.
Not very extreme or sporty, but still a pretty awesome scent in my opinion.
On first sniff it is very generic and familiar, but after about an hour or so it opens up a bit and starts to smell very sweet, like candy. Reminds me a bit of one-million. Like it was its more mature older cousin.
Overall a pretty good day scent that is unique enough to get noticed but not so strong that you can't wear it in casual situations.
Revisiting this again just to reiterate more->
Cuz these days it's raining in my place , i am in a romantic mood most of the times.This perfume is sexy and different.For first 1-2 minutes it tends to give a familiar illusion that you have smelled it before like some soap or some bathing lotion's bubbles but after 2-3 mins , it gives me idea that no , i havenot smelled something like this before ever.It is too fresh and too sexy.I think this can make any girl go wild.
Nothing to me was as sexy like this perfume.I cant describe it much but it is sexy and seems like some soapy smell.
I will always have this in my collection.Negative point is that it lasts 2-3 hours not more.
Positive is that it is freshest among the freshest shit out there and different and any weather scent.
My dream- i want this on me when i want some lover of me go wild on me due to its trail.
Verdict- 2 steps less than a masterpiece.8/10
I think a lot of the hate and dissapointment for this frag stems from the poor naming. Its not very sporty and its not very extreme. With that having been said, I love this scent!
For me this is a perfect work frag, really fresh and pleasing. I'm not a huge fan of citrus fragrances and I don't like AHS, I find it very synthetic. But this is so much nicer. A little citrus up front but a much nicer backbone with the vanilla and tonka bean. Yea its not really original and no it doesn't smell a whole lot like the others, but I thoroughly enjoy it! Perfect for work or anywhere you don't want to offend people. Lasts a good 8 hrs on my skin.
Highly recommend!
8.5/10
Smells like Pears Mint Soap. The blue ones.
In the mid original allure pour homme with more pepper. In the base there are the same. I prefer the original allure.
I love this stuff it's last I swear 24 hours on me it's refreshing get a lot of complaints and to me it a step up in quality form other designer fragrance this is my go to if I can't pick from the collection .
This is not a sporty fragrance! It's actually best for cold weather and nights out imo. It performs really well in longevity and projection. Seriously, go easy on the trigger! :D Overall I really like it, it's one that grows on you. I think the original Allure Homme is better smelling and is more versatile, but this one wins for performance.
Smell 3.5/4
Longevity 2/2
Projection 2/2
Versatility 1-1.5/2 (Not too sure about those summer/spring votes up there... I think it might get too cloying...)
TOTAL 8.5-9/10
I absolutely love the original but this isn't even in the same league. they overdid the tonka bean note and mixes with the citrus to give this a play-dough like smell. don't get me wrong its nice in the beginning but after about 2.5 hours you smell like you were attacked by a toddler who threw tons of play-dough at you. the tonka is far to strong
It's basically the winter version of Allure Homme Sport, and that's not a bad thing. I personally like this better than AHS. If one saw my collection, most of what I'm drawn to are darker wintery scents, simply because I find them more interesting, so for my purposes AHSEE is the perfect sumer scent. It has great longevity (I get over 12 hours personally) with average to slightly above average sillage. The warm, sweet tonka note that dominates the drydown makes this scent totally viable as a fall, and even winter fragrance while the citrus opening and overall freshness of this gives it the "Sport" moniker, making it a good summer scent. I'm as surprised as anybody to find a "Sport" scent that works for all four seasons for me, but this is it. AHSEE has become one of my workhorse fragrances for its versatility and its overall quality. I highly recommend it. 9/10
After spending more time with this fragrance. I found this to be my favourite Chanel fragrance for a night out. It's really sweet, and pretty strong. I keep getting more and more compliments. Have not had a bad experience yet. Other than I still think it smells like baby powder on my shirt.
It is good , longevity is about 2+ hours or something.It has a nice calming effect , you may feel like lying on bed for some more moments if you were already lying.I know this seems otherwise , because it is labelled sport fragrance.
It will remind you also of soaps and soapiness which lurks in it.You must have smelled , soap bubbles and soap foam , this is what it reminds me of.
You may think that you could be able to smell something like this in much less price tag which is a let down point for this.All in all , a fresh , somewhat different than other mainstream fragrances/smells we have been smelling a lot quite lately.
I have a sample of this fragrance and decide to give it a try although sport type of fragrance is usually not my cup of tea. My writing is by no mean a fair review of this fragrance as I have it on my skin for only about 40 minutes; however, the whole time I can only think of double mint tooth paste, extra cool sport rub, tiger balm and some Chinese/Asian camphor based medicine oil. So I can't help but ask myself do I really want to pay so much to smell like any of these?
Fino y delicioso! Esperaba algo mas original, pero me gusto bastante este perfume. No es para mi, no es juvenil. Aunque es "sport", es mas clase que casual.
damn it and go fo Edition Blanche.though it is not a dissappoint
unisex, this what women can also use
I think it is lacking something. Not bad and very resemblant to the original, but I think they could have worked more on the drydown to smell more refined than this sweet and sour result. I will have to try it again on warmer days to see if something happens. A bit disappointed. It is very wearable however.
It smells just like cheap minty bubble gum...
Go for Allure homme édition blanche, much much better!
Here is a short and updated review.
I am rediscovering all of my fragrances now, because I simply refuse to spend any more money until they are gone. The Allure Homme Sport Eau Extreme just has an equally refreshing and pleasant overall scent. It has not been one of my go to fragrances, but that will change. I don't consider this fragrance to be daring. It's just a very clean aromatic blend.
I test it the other day in an airport duty free, and I like it but didnt purchase it, becouse I think there are better fragances outhere that I really like more than this, Still a solid fragance like everything from chanel. Smell wise its a grown up allure sport, sweeter and nice.
I hate this tonka bean odor they all use it the last 1-2 years in their perfumes...this is the same more or less with the original but more creamy and powdery.
An update for my review: simply the more i wear it, the more i love it, really, totally stunning, to me and others.. comfortable, manly, sexy, versatile, nothing avantgarde in smell but really charming and lovely!
First off, this scent gets way too much hate because of two reasons.
Reason 1: The name doesn't describe what the scent really is. This isn't a sporty fragrance. Allure homme sport is more of a sporty fragrance. This isn't.
Reason 2: It is perhaps too close to other allure scents (a mix of allure pour homme and AHS), so it isn't a necessary purchase if you have those two Chanel fragrances.
That being said, this stuff is awesome. This is my favorite in the allure series, and one of my favorites of all time. It gets compliments and it has good lasting power. I have dry, fair skin and usually scents are gone within a couple of hours. Not eau extreme, I get around 8 hours with this stuff, and about 4 hours with decent (arms length or maybe a little more) projection.
Try before you buy, as always, but I HIGHLY recommend this scent. Ignore the name and judge this based on it's scent people!
I was curious to try this after reading the reviews, I chose to buy this rather than the original AHS as I am not crazy for sharp citrus heavy frags. I have Bleu and that seems to be ok and quite smooth, nothing exceptional but long lasting for summer. I wanted to try this one as I was curous about it. Sampled it the other day and I am impressed. I do not find it to be too sweet but just right. I get citrus fruit at the start and then it tones down into a smoother creamier fragrance. In the drydown I can still detect citrus but a very smooth balmy citrus which is very pleasant. A lot of people have said that this can be worn in winter due to it's sweetness. I beg to differ as I do not think this has the bravado to stand out as well as some of my other winter favorites. I think Summer,Spring and Autumn are suitable for this but definitely not a cold winter like we get here in Scotland. I think he longevity and sillage of AHSEE is excellent. Just what I was looking for in a warmer weather season
To Nanodae, a friend of mine also like the whole Allure pour Homme line. They seems to get some feminine vibe when she wears them, and sometimes I cannot guess what she is wearing that being exactly what I am also wearing. I think our own skin chages a scent quite a bit.
I'm a female but in love with this scent. I prefer masculine scents over feminine. It boosts confidence, isn't too strong as long as you spray a small amount, affordable and overall a good fragrance (:
I see that many people tend to hate this fragrance just because it's been marketed as "sport". Yes it does have the allure vibe in it and it reminds me of the original AHS, but it is NOT in any way sporty. However, this juice may have the wrong name but it is absolutely gorgeus. It smells like a sweet orange pie. It is very VERY balmy and creamy with a jellyish orange vibe dominating as the sweetener. It's just a little spicy and mint I do not detect at all.
Yes, this might not be groundbreaking, but it is very pleasing; something I would wear daily just to smell good but not to impress someone. However what I think makes this one special is because of the beautiful sweetened orange note. This is as sweet as le male or LL au masculin BUT it still preserves it's masculinity and mature vibe. This would certainly suit a man aged 35-50. Le male is something you smell among the teenagers and it would be a farce if someone over 30 would use it. AHS eau extreme however is in the same category but is much much more classy.
Definitely recomended, just ignore the bottle; the juice inside is top quality, as expected from Chanel. Also Longevity and sillage are way beyond average.
It smells pleasant enough for me in short bursts but the trouble with actually wearing it is that I find it too sweet, too creamy. I could see it for someone else, but for me I would want more spice or smokiness to balance out all that sweetness. It's funny because it's like I love it and hate it at the same time. I almost bought it the first time I smelled it, but I hesitated and the sales associate at Sephora offered me a sample of it. After wearing it several times, and now even several months later, I seem to go back and forth between being enchanted by it and made queasy by it. It's the strangest thing.
They weren't joking when they put "EXTREME" on the bottle in all caps.
It's funny people would complain about the strength of this fragrance when it says EXTREME on the bottle.
It is definitely EXTREME. Even 3 days later. The room you were in when you applied it and every room you've visited since then will be Allure EXTREME'd for days.
This isn't a bad thing if you're like me and you like tonka beans and musk. The citrus/mint/cypress opening only lasts a couple minutes, unfortunately.
93/100
Not seeing the "Code" comparisons at all, it smells NOTHING like any of the Code range. This dries down into a wonderfully classy scent. I'm a fan of the original Sport and this is a lot sweeter but it takes a lot of the sharper elements out and are replaced with softer, more mature elements. All in a fantastic scent with great projection and longevity.
Pleasing but nothing groundbreaking. Smells like CH212 sexy men minus the sweat note. This is a sweet, grown up mans scent.
Chanel Allure Homme Sport Eau Extreme is beautiful. Exactly what a modern cologne should be.
Opening: Citrusy notes blend wonderfully with a minty musky smell right off the bat. Delicious.
Sillage: Excellent. It projects just the right amount to leave that wafting hint you might get walking past someone in an elevator. 2-3 feet, 3-4 hours for me.
Longevity: Very good. Lasts for hours and hours, still noticable for about 12-16 hours. I would say its very similar to Code in both projection and staying power.
Gripes: Miscategorized. Its not sport at all, its got very deep and long lasting smell. The citrus notes are understated. Can be cloying if oversprayed, other than that, meh.
Best for: A night out at a club or bar or wherever. Its projection is best in a crowd of people because its so sweet and bold, and it will last all night. Best in the fall or winter I would say.
Overall: Color me impressed. I love it. It hits all the right blends of sweetness and muskyness. Like the colognes my dad wore, its bold and rich, but its not overwhelming like his were :) Very modern, very masculine, totally worth a buy.
8/10
it projects well an it doesn't smell bad ... the more i wear it the less i like it (probably because i wore on hot summer days), i bought more cause of the chanel name, it smells nice and unoffensive so i wear it to work
The projection of this in insane.... six hours after application a co-worker said 'wow, thats alot of cologne' from about five feet away - i only put on two sprays
Very sweet. So much tonka bean that it almost treads into Le Male territory. I'm not a fan of sweet scents, so this really isn't for me.
Another thing worth noting - Allure Homme Sport has definitely been reformulated. I first wore it like five years ago and it smells a lot sweeter and more powdery. Such a shame.
Wow,.
Thumbs Up for this one.
I found it perfect to wear this fragrance this fall since its way to sweet for hot weather. This fragrance lasts and projects more than AHS. The tonkabean is prominent through out my entire time wearing this. Its a really pleasant smelling fragrance that the ladies adore, espcialy when they catch a wiff of it on your shirt. My girl likes this. Sweet and inoffensive. As for my time wearing it? I agree with many here, its nothing new or even interesting. I prefer the less uninteresting Bleu.
Really nice scent, but not for hot days in summer, it's much better in fall and winter.. very sweet and intensive. longevity about 12 hours, I get a compliment for it after 10 hours I applied it :) it's funny how people are stupid and brainwashed by many commercials.. I freaked out when someone says: this is great for spray it when you are going in gym, or running etc... wtf?? because of this "sport" in his name?? no, this definitelly is not sporty scent.. I think it is suitable for wearing it for some romantic occasions or a date.. :)
Its the best fragrance i've had. Its fresh and lasted for 6 hrs on me. Its fresh and good for hot climate country like Brunei.
Eau Extreme is a powdery, minty, vanillic fragrance reminiscent of JPG Le Male or perhaps Prada Amber. It's not a bad fragrance by any means, but I don't like it. It smells nothing like Homme Sport on my skin, nor is it "sporty." It's closer to the original Allure Homme in composition.
I would NOT recommend that Eau Exreme be worn in hot weather. It's just too powdery and vanillic for that type of setting, IMO.
Try it if you're a fan of Allure Homme or Allure Homme Sport, but I'll pass on this one.
This fragrance is the bomb. Long lasting. Smells great.
Beautiful fragrance. It's so classy. Projects well but does not over power or offend.
I wouldn't wear this at the gym or for working out even though it's called a "sport" frag. It is just too strong and sweet for that in my opinion.
I prefer it has a casual scent for grad school classes, work, or a quite evening out. For me, this is perfect for spring, cooler summer days, and early to mid fall.
they are different but both are good in adifferent way. i don´t considered the allure eau extreme a sport fragrance
Is it just me or is this one better than Allure Homme Sport?
extremely dangerous fragance sports, all my work-mates want it they want buy this spice and good cologne fragance very very soon.

Clean, pleasant, inviting, and smooth. Just a pleasure to wear. It just makes me smile whenever I wear Allure Homme Sport Eau Extreme because of its aroma therapy properties.
Like it or not no one can deny the fact that this projects like a MONSTER. I hope my other colognes project like this.

my friend from work wore this today.....let me tell you, he uses like one spray on his neck and 1 spray on the wrist & dabs them together..this stuff had excellent projection, great sillage (the smelled lingered for a few minutes after he left the room)and I smelled it on him for the 5 hrs i was with him.....to bad I'm not a fan of the scent
Off the bat it is citrus/tonka bean.
Then it fades to tonka mainly and stays that way for a long time.
That's the main note and the other notes you have to find so basically, this just smells like tonka which smells a slight less concentrated than cocoa butter. This is not a fragrance that I would reach for daily, but for occasions with older folks or lots of people at a night gathering.
This would work well if you go to events for school or with a group of a few friends.
I bought this yesterday just to see how it goes and in comparison with the original AHS.
The perfumes are more or less, brothers. The one is more citrus/orange, the other more gourmand/warm but you cant miss the similarities. Personally, i think I prefer the EE but as i find AHS a little bit harsh.
I would say that if you have the one, you do not necessarily need the other.
What i would like to say is that Chanel the last years is not taking the ball further, is playing between their perfumes and they are not releasing anything new, original or groundbraking. They are just making perfume that smell like hundreds of others. Blue and EE are a mix of some older perfumes but we can see that they succeed and bring money to the headspring, this is what they want although I do not agree....but money is what counts and not individual opinios or perfumes for the few. We have so many perfumes now and the market goes towards sweet/citrus/vanillic as most of us, prefer those type of perfumes. You do noe find fahrenheit releases now or Ecre noir....the mainstream companies do not want to risk and if someone wants these type of perfumes, he has to go to a niche brand. Chanel is producing quality, high standard perfumes but not uniqueness....The best from their line is still platinum for me. But i like EE because it gives you a wave of freshness and depth....it has a light soapy vibe that i like a lot, being fun of acqua di parma...
I already owned Allure Homme Sport (AHS), but due to curiosity, I bought this Eau Extreme (EE) version in 50ml just today.
I sprayed the EE on my left wrist, & my favorite AHS on my right wrist. Both of them were quite similar at the very beginning, in which EE started with strong alcohol, citrus, mint, vanilla, but the citrus seemed fade away very shortly.
When it dried down, the pepper & tonka bean came out obviously, and I found EE was sweeter than the AHS.
To me, I still think AHS could give me the feel of elegance, but EE couldn't, instead EE only give me a fresh and sweet scene, which is more general, nothing special feeling...not unique at all
IMO, EE is a combination of the AHS & the original Allure Homme (AH), which takes the fresh citrus from the AHS & the base note tonka bean from AH, so if you already have either one of AHS / AH, you probably could pass on this EE, unless you are a super fan of Chanel house...
Awesome! Great smell.
This shouldn't be called 'sport'. This is more like a cologne you'd wear when you go out to dinner on summer night
Got it a week ago, and after testing it i can say that this is less "Sport" than Antaeus! Smell like the original AHS only 3min (literally) and then a huge blast of tonka remind me a lot of Armani Code (i'm not saying that they wanted to copy/paste one of the most hyped fragrances at the moment...)!). Conclussion: This is more like "LA NUIT DE ALLURE" (?!) than AHSport. Anyway.. is it good? Can´t say that it isn't.. Gets compliments? Yes, a decent amount. The best CHANEL? By no means. Worthy of the CHANEL price? I don´t think so. I would pick LA NUIT, CODE, or even LE MALE over this any given time.
Seriously underrated fragrance. One of those rare ones that becomes more lovely as it develops. I keep getting gorgeous wafts of this throughout the day, especially when sprayed on clothing. Forget the "sport" in the name and just judge it as a smell. I think it's rather beautiful.
Um unimpressed, about the concept and the fragrance.
I imagined Allure Sport with more testosterone, but i got Allure VIP (Allure sport + Carolina Herrera VIP)
But the result is weaker in sillage and projection to the two above.
It is not bad, it just that it isnt an sport fragrance.
I imagined like Allure sport, but more like Versace pour homme in the aquatic and woody department, reducing the Tonka and vanilla, and filled with some resin like the soft touch of Abercrombie Fierce. The base would be incredible with some nice woods and strong but smooth musk.
Overall: pasable, but if you want a Chanel go for Pour Homme, Sport or Bleu.
Im not sure if I like this scent, the opening is great with the mint and lighter accords but very quickly it is turning a bit bland. that being said as i go about every now and then I get a smell of something exquistitly beutiful but when i go and try and catch it the aroma escapes and hides behind the pepper.
I am hoping as this calms down the spice goes away and it becomes smoother.
just bought 100 ml.. blind buy.. it smell strange at first and slowly turn into something lovely and good. well done
I have been wearing this for quite some time, and I still don't know what to think of it. For sure, this is nothing like Allure Homme Sport. It's not a lemoney scent anymore. I get a lot of tonka bean. It's syrupy but not all that sweet. It's rich and rather heavy. Not exactly fresh nor it is totally warm either. Everything smells pleasantly weird to me, especially the mint (or basil?). Not a blind buy and it requires multiple tests before making a final decision. For me, the best way to go is to get a lot of sample or a decant, that's all I'd really need.
I love it! Not sure why its a "sport". After smelling the others, I think this one was worthy of its own name. I've received very nice compliments at work and church.
very very good
I returned this within one day for another bottle of Sport. This smells just like sport does in the beginning and then tonka and musk come out. It does not work!
Oh
Starts very similar to Allure Sport and drydowns to Le Male. I prefer the original much better.
Sillage and Longevity are above average.
Perfumery is dead! Even the great houses like Chanel and Dior keep releasing crap fragrances. Allure Homme Sport Eau Extrême is not extreme at all. It's a sweetened version of the original Allure Homme Sport. Creativity = Zero!
The opening of Eau Extrême ist identical to the opening of Allure Homme Sport. But shortly after the initial blast of generic freshness, the fragrance becomes sweeter, the sporty notes fade away. A big tonkabean note takes over the whole composition. It starts to smell nauseatingly cheap, like a drugstore air freshener. I was really surprised that a Chanel fragrance could smell that inexpensive. The same, sweet air freshener note was also very present in A*Men Pure Havane's base. I really loathe that nasty smell, but it completely dominates Allure Homme Sport Eau Extrême.
What is so appealing about a synthetic tonkabean perfume? Why is it even called ,,sport"? What is sporty about a rubbishy sweetness? A big disappointment by Chanel.
full of ambergris.better than the original IMHO..
appena spruzzato si riconosce bene il cipresso,poi subito dopo si appiattisce il tutto diventando leggero e dolce.mi ricorda a tratti best company cologne for men.
e' comunque un pizzico piu' moderno ma di extreme soltanto il nome.
More tonka then the orginal , it's more sweet , slightley warmer and has the original aldehydic sea like scent.
It's not more powerful then the original , tonka is more intensive only.
Longevity and projection seems less the the original wich is kinda weird ! But still long lasting(6 hours).
Quality but it give me just like the original a nausea feeling.
For me , the cologne version is the best from the sport line!
KEEP IT COMING HATERS! THE MORE YOU HATE, THE LESS YOU WEAR IT, THE MORE UNIQUE I WILL BE :)
I can tell you exactly what this is reminiscent of. It reminds me of Joop Jump! with a touch of le male and allure homme sport. I loved Joop but it was a bit harsh and too powdery to my nose. This is the perfect alternative.
I'll be honest. This isn't bad at all. But to me, it smells like a weaker version of JPG's Le Male Terrible. I prefer the original Allure Sport. That one is the bomb!
New edit:
What was I saying? This is some good stuff! Yes it reminds me a bit of Le Male but other than that I grew to like this one after going through two samples! Might consider a purchase soon. Longevity wasn't bad!
This is a melding of the original Allure Homme and Allure Homme Sport. It's as if the original Allure Homme had a mid-life crisis and instead of wearing his usual jacket with wide shoulders decided to wear his younger brother's sleeker and more modern jacket, one made of of ozonic musk which envelopes Eau Extreme's tonka core, which I always felt was M. Polge's signature note in all of his earlier creations. I'm happy to smell it again!
I couldn't understand what people meant when they referred to the original Homme Sport as an aquatic--it didn't smell like the aquatics of Acqua di Gio, Cool Water, or Bvlgari Aqva. Maybe Creed Silver Mountain Water, but not the aforementioned aquatic standards, so I guess some people can zero in on that ozonic musk odor and I was just distracted by the other wonderful notes in the original Homme Sport.
What this scent has to do with surf and surfers I absolutely do not know, but if they decided that French fashion was their pastime away from the water, we might have a connection. Danny Fuller is from my home state, and I can tell you now that no full time surfer would wear any scent other than the smell of salt water in their hair and the smell of their own skin and the occasional flower lei.
Eau Extreme seems to have great longevity, but on myself, it stays close to the skin. It is warm, very spicy and woody for much of the duration. It doesn't have the lilt of Homme Sport, but I'm quite happy it has the deep nuances of the original Allure. Somewhere down the line they killed the longevity of the original Allure and has since castrated it somewhat. Nice to know Eau Extreme has come to the forefront to pay homage and at the same time don itself with touches of modernity.
Starts off like a deeper version of Allure Pour Homme Sport - then the Sportness of it fades away and It spins into something resembling a gourmand - not all all what a "sport" moniker evokes mentally. After 30 min, it is nothing like APHS.
It reminds me of Bond No. 9 I Love New York for Him - starts off as sweet citrus summer scent, then evolves into a dark cold weather scent.
I want my summer aquatics to stay that way, and a gouramond to start off there. Probably the worst Chanel I have tried.
An autumnal, romantic, strong yet subtle, unisex fragrance which is a creamy-spicy blend...
I applied 6 heavy sprays.
0 - 30 secs - Alcohol, modern, clean, not much
30 secs - 1 hour. 1.5 foot projection - superb. It settles down after 30 secs to an on the skin very common place creamy-spicy aroma - a bit like harsh spicy rice wine and not too my taste. This is similar to many others on the skin e.g Surge Lutens Gris Clair or Daim Blonde. The scent which projects however is much better and is softer, creamier and alluring with less spice. This scent is ideal in the autumn, very romantic, with walks around falling leaves. There is nothing Sport about this.
1 - 3.5 hours. Still 1.5 foot projection, great! On the skin the harsh rice wine smell gets a smoother perfumed feminine twist and it becomes now a little more of its personality and easier on the nose. The scent which projects is like a more pungent version of Azzaro Chrome Legend for men
3.5 hours - 4.5 hours. 1.25 foot projection, same smell as above. Less unisex now as the spiciness re-appears and more masculine Ages 38-58. Again the scent which projects is much younger and creamier - ages 22 - 38. IMHO I would prefer to spray this on the torso or arms to let the better projecting smell waft upwards as opposed to spraying behind the ears as you will get some of the scent on the skin, which is harsh spiciness
4.5 hours - 5 hours. 1 foot projection, yet subtle. Same scent as above
5 hours - 6 hours. 6 inch projection, yet subtle, Same scent as above
6-7 hours - 2 inch projection. Subtle like above
7-8 hours. Close to skin
There is nothing sport about this, instead this is one to wear if you are falling in love. Romantic and strong, yet subtle.
If you are wanting a strong summer refreshing male sport frag, then I recommend you look at Lanvin Homme Sport which projects and lasts all day and is so affordable and chills you out
Good, but I wouldn't purchase
Extreme price but rich in flavour. I really love it. I am big Chanel's fan and I bought all of Allure frags, and Chanel Extreme recently.
All of them, longevity in my skin the projection is fairly close to the skin, the longevity is poor.
They are not perfume they are just cologne.
I usually wear Bleu or Chanel Homme Sport, but I think Extreme it's sweeter than Homme Sport.
I am very happy to have bought the Extreme
more i wear it more i like it
well balanced
9 out of 10
I BOUGHT THIS FRAGRANCE AND IT IS NOT SIMILAR TO THE
OLD ONE AT ALL,IT'S VERY FRESH THAN THE OLD SPORT
I CAN SAY THAT CHANEL HOUSE WILL NOT RELEASE ANY
COLOGNE OR PERFUME JUST FOR ''MONEY'' BECAUSE THEY
ARE BIGGER THAN THIS THOUGHT,THIS FASHION HOUSE
TRYING TO KEEP THEIR REPUTATION ALWAYS IN THE SAVE
SIDE SO,I THINK THEY HAVE DONE A GOOD JOB WITH THIS.
Sadly, there is very little that is alluring about this release. It smells like a pale, plain, middle child brother of the original Allure. I tried it on my skin. I sniffed and sniffed. My only instant reaction was a yawn. It was neither here nor there, similar to sitting through a very slow movie.
Where is the alluring quality and where is the air of Chanel luxury? None to speak of I'm afraid.
If this was bottled in a generic bottle, it would have found its place in Coty's wall of similar smelling sports fragrances.
I understand the frustration of Chanel fans about this Allure. Eau extreme is a cross between Allure Homme and Allure Homme Sport. Less citrus and sweeter, it's nice and wearable, pretty versatile. However the fragrance brings nothing new to the Allure line.
PS: I can easily see this as my first bottle in the Allure line.
Its really extreme in terms of elegance and richness.The perfume begins like allure homme sport in the first 5 minutes and then develops into a rich sweet hearts and then rests down to a sensual musky base which is extremely sexy and distinctive,people might have been expecting something new with a modern twist but here the name suggests shades of the original with a more deep and sensual scent,its a master piece and better by far than bleu which I think that people were comparing it to axe and now they are enjoying it.
Eau extreme is extremely chanel in terms of scent quality and elegant packaging,well done Mr polge.
very similar to the original AHS but less spicy....For my taste, it does not deserve the purchase. It is a nice pleasant perfume but those who have the original, this is a waste of money because the AHS is very good also in terms of longevity, sillage etc. It is a twin brother in a different colour bottle. I would say is slightly sweeter than the AHS.
was disspointed....don't like it. I love regular allure sport, I tought that this will be better, just stronger, but no, smells cheap for me..
VDXL I wonder what you would say about CH212 with 2 or 3 editions every year... Chanel is by far one of the greatest perfume houses...
Haven't tested this on my skin, just on the bottle: it's a milker and more intense Allure Sport ( can't pronounce on sillage and lasting power). By the way, Chanel, you already have a lot of Allure references: classic, eau fraichissante pour l'ete, Sport, Sport Cologne, Edition Blanche, Sport Extreme. The same number of offerings Axe has on the shelves at 2 percent the price. Where is the luxury appeal, the focus on quality and innovation? We only have markets that have to be flooded with new releases every year (every season even). Also, perfumes have to be reformulated periodically, because "IFRA" says "this substance will cause you cancer and etc. ". Come on, reality is other: perfumes have to become cheaper to produce and more expensive to sell. The label is more important than the smell, unfortunately. Should I say the noses at Chanel are useless? Come on, Cristopher Sheldrake, focus more on Serge Lutens.
Except the word Sport I ve liked this really, if was named different would be great.
The good is that original's similarity to Issey Miyake has gone which I never liked and the rest is boosted in a deeper a richer way.
Very good projection and longevity.
If I ll own one I will probably put a sticker on the word Sport :)
There should be a rule against being able to choose that a fragrance reminds you of it's predecessor. Too easy. However, in the case of Eau Extreme... it's NOTHING, I repeat NOTHING like original Allure Homme Sport. Although it states "woody aromatic", it comes off like a balmy-oriental. Something in the mind of Armani Code and DSQUARED He Wood Silver Wind. For a fragrance that doesn't contain amber, it sure gives that impression, especially 3-5 minutes after settling into the skin. This is the best Allure since the very first. Definitely worth having among your collection.
Not similar to the original AHS.
The top notes blend together into a homogenous scent which is very soft and fizzy. I find it very hard to pick out the individual notes.
The mint is the hardest to pick up for me. I would never have guessed it was there if I hadn´t known.
Cypress and sage are the most prominent notes, then mandarin orange and last mint.
From the very beginning I can detect tonka bean and pepper, which is quite prominent.
The other base notes start to appear after about one hour, mixed with the top notes still lingering.
Very good quality juice and long lasting. But after about three hours it becomes very close to the skin on me. Soapy wood after about 4 hours.
When I smell this, the last thing that comes to mind is sport. They should have given it another name altogether!
I have Allure Homme Sport, but this is so good and different that I just might get a bottle. It is not a "version" of the original.
9/10 from me!
I do not understand so many negative reviews, Chanel tried to put the saturated notes in the first Allure sport to a wamer tunes with florals and aromatics lines. The first moments in Eau Extreme are sweet, fresh, fruity and maybe nothing new but the smell turns so lovely, confident, charming, sexy and very versatile in the last phase..
Surely we all expect something new, modern and different from Chanel but not simple, straightforward and easy to enjoy a great creation is discarded.
I love the new Allure Sport..an smiling scent.
Perfect. Original, fresh, aromatic. My new signature scent. A masterpice from Mr. Jacques Polge.
i am a fan of chanel and have all chanel perfumes, but with this eau axtreme i just want to say that nxt time chanel has to seriously think before launching its next mens perfume, seriously, even blue de chanel was not up to mark , but with this new release they have gone too down.
Finally tested today. Somehow similar to the AHS for an untrained nose but indeed is different, unfortunately inherits the name Sport since its parent is named Sport, actually this one has nothing to do with sport.
I have really allergy to the word Sport on fragrances, what is trying to be achieved by Sport (wearing to the gym?!), I dont have any idea. Giant houses such as Chanel shouldnt launch fragrances with name Sport.
If I had to choose of one them I would choose this one.
Initial impressions were pepper was boosted, some kinda soapy, richer, more powdery and floral, woodier and also dirtier. I detect vetiver as well.
Need to test more to give a fair opinion.
I've tested this twice on my wrists. Not bad, but not great, in my opinion. It starts out like Allure Homme Sport with something extra that isn't quite appealing to my nose. The drydown is powdery with some vanilla and isn't to my liking. Others may like the drydown, but not me. I don't get the extreme part of the name or the scent of the fragrance. I'm passing on this one. I'll stick with Allure Homme Sport.
A powdery, sweet version of the original Allure... I love it.
Eau Extreme, how? It turns very faint after 2 hours :-(
Extreme? Sure ok whatever you say. WOW, huge disappointment! Here we go, fades quick, synthetic and one demential. So unoriginal and boring that I find it hard to believe that Chanel put this out. Don't wast your time or $$, move on my friends.
worthy of this House!
------------
I agree with him.
I sprayed this on the other day at Macy's. This is not a bad fragrance, but at the same time it's nothing special. Especially considering the price tag.
They shouldn’t have launched this one bottom line. Starts as allure sport. Turns into Edition Blanche and then gets stuck. It smells like an old lady’s perfume to me. Not good. Dissapointed in my favorite non-niche fragrance house on this. Bad move Chanel…bad move.
I was excited to test this fragrance. So, the first time I found it, I sprayed it on a paper. My opinion: Not bad. It's OK. BUT: the store attendant (a girl) was very honest, she said she don't like it. So, that was a warning to me: "women don't like this fragrance, don't buy it". LOL
Well, I didn't intent to buy it anyway...
Of course it does start off very similar to Allure Sport, but it quickly takes a turn in another direction entirely. To me it shares some similarities with Givenchy Pi. It is sort of a mix between Allure Sport and that same cookie dough vanilla, powdery feeling of Givenchy Pi.
VILE VILE VILE JUICE!
Avoid at all costs!
Disgustingly powdery, by far the worst Allure fragrance. It's a disgrace!
I currently have one spray from a sample on my wrist, and every time i put my nose anywhere near it, i feel like I'm not only smelling, but tasting detergent! Over priced to a treat!
AVOID AVOID AVOID!
I'm not an Allure hater, i currently have edition blanche and i adore it! But this eau extreme is vile juice
well what a let down by chanel cant believe, the original allure homme sport was a fantastic i still love it to the core, but this eau extreme is one of the worst frm chanel, they will have to think seriously before launching anything in future.
Disgusting... The drydown alone offended me. Ill stick to the original AHS ....pass on this one. Major pass
Smells nearly identical to Allure Homme Sport (and Allure Homme, in some respects), except for maybe that there's more tonka, in the Le Male style as others have noted.
Pleasant, but not my thing. I think the Allure line has gone through some rough reformulations in the past few years.
sorry but in my opinion this is a terrible release :(
longevity is like max 2 hours on my skin and projection is also very poor + the scent smells even cheaper then the new releases from gucci .. shame on chanel :(
Found this very similar to Allure Home Sport. Same top notes to me, with a warmer middle and base.
I would agree with the comments that it's not very extreme in terms of smell. One thing I found amazing though - I sprayed one spray on the top of my hand - honestly, 2 days later I could still detect it. And before your ask, yes I do wash! I've never experienced that before - whatever they use for longevity it seems to work.
Extreme? Sure ok whatever you say. WOW, huge disappointment! Here we go, fades quick, synthetic and one demential. So unoriginal and boring that I find it hard to believe that Chanel put this out. Don't wast your time or $$, move on my friends.
Better yet buy A bottle of Allure or Bleu. 1/10 not worthy of this House!
Allure Homme Sport Eau Extreme is a beautifully rich and warm scent. It is powdery and intimate. It has a very comforting and inviting energy. It is ideal for those cozy sweater wearing nights with your sweetheart.
I´m with U "Unfinished" concerning the parrelerals with bleu de Chanel, I got a very faint similarity with the original Allure Homme Sport EDT, I have this feeling I have a complete other perception of the word "Extreme", coz this is not intense or longlasting at all, atleast not on me. Anyway, its pleasant alright, but nothin different from the usual crap. I would rather go for its predecesor, its definitley lovelier than this, U really miss the vanilla, even if the tonka still makes it sweet, the good freshy part of its predecesor is completly missin here. SO for all your info, just go for it if you want something safe. nothin much.
This flanker should have been named Bleu Extreme. It has more in common with Bleu than Allure Sport. Imagine cross between Bleu (top and middle) and Paco Rabanne 1 Million (base) It smells generic and has similar semi-sweet drydown with Paco Rabanne 1 Million, Diesel Only the Brave, John Varvatos, etc. Chanel plays safe with this fragrance. The fragrance has quality, projects well and is longlasting but without any distinctive character. I got one compliment wearing this. Thumbs neutral.(((
It is better than Bleu de chanel,but No new + I hope Chanel perfume launch close to the Creed ( Silver Mountain Water )
Allure Homme Sport Eau Extreme
Scent:6.5/10
Projection:6.5/10
Longevity:7/10
Final Rating:6.5/10
Good, but want the best
I have been the biggest of fans of all allure frags over the years and still hold the original allure and sport versions in my top five fragrances ever. I also liked the later flankers. I was very excited about the new extreme version. The bottle is fantastic and beautiful, however having tried the fragrance now for a few days, I am a little disappointed. With some much competition of new fragrances it could be much more. It is pleasant, but nothing more, it is simply not distinctive enough. it gets better after approx an hour, although there is a note in there that reminds me of a more traditional than modern feel. The only thing extreme is the price, £66 at Boots, not just extreme but obscene!
Just bought the 100 ml today and received 2 10ml EDT's extra as free samples :)
It's a flanker of a flanker from the Allure line.
I own all 11 Chanel Homme frags and all in the largest available bottle sizes.
I have to say that I love the original Allure Homme and have done so since it was released.
Then came the Allure Sport and to me this is nothing special, but yet it's the top seller from Chanel for 10 years - and I have to admit, that while it's boring and safe, it is a very good sport scent and one of the better sport frags out there.
Eau Extreme is NOTHING like the other Allure frags.
The top notes gives you a sweet cloying minty vanilla with a bit of citrus in there.
This frag is quite heavy for a sport fragrance - I feel this might have rather good longevity for such a type of frag.
I still sense the vanilla & mint in the dry down, but the Tonka Bean is more prevalent along with the musk and cedar.
All in all I actually give this a thumbs up rating.
Longevity on my skin was very good - 7-8 hours solid.
Projection is strong for the first 1-2 hours, then the scent stays closer to the skin.
I actually like this frag more than I though I would.
Imagine a JPG Le Male in a lighter less cloying version and with the mid notes from the Allure Sport - this is what Eau Extreme smells like to my nose.
Rating:
Longevity: 8/10
Projection: 8/10
Scent: 9/10 (for a sport scent)
Overall: 8.5/10
If you don't like Le Male and Allure Sport, then stay far far away from this.
If you like Le Male and/or Allure Sport, you definitely should check this frag out.
Experiencing "Allure Homme Sport Eau Extreme" leaves you with a big questionmark (at times when a big exclamation mark is what everyone seems to want).
Imagine this as a frail version of the now discontinued "Allure Homme Eau Fraichissante Pour l`Ete" with an almost evident dose of "Le Male's" main accord for the first hour or so.
The brilliantly executed commercial of a windsurfer challenging the ocean's waves with grace, feels rather misplaced for this smell but its low contrast b/w aesthetics do the perfume's sandalwood facet good justice for sure!
For a male perfume (much like "Bleu" before it) it is rather "thin" (to put it diplomatically). It needs more character to make any statement, something in excess.
The artistic designers/director have done a marvellous job (as always) but from a house with the tradition and know how like this one, we all expect more originality (to be honest, in this case this doubles with "common sense") and a troubled spirit.
It's safe enough to say that the only "extreme" thing about "Allure Sport Eau Extreme" is the word on its bottle. A very conventional creation indeed.
a note: the projection is fairly close to the skin, the longevity is poor.
Costly for sure. But to a chanel fans it won't be a problem rather than buying much of boring frag marked with different designer brands but they all share the same notes.
Pleased to wait for this one
Bein a huge fan of its predecesor, I will definatley try this one straight away. Can hardly wait.
I wasn't really impressed by this Eau Extreme. It is typical "intense" version of the regular fragrance with a big amount of tonka beans and something balsamic (like balsamic notes in Blv Notte and Cerruti Si). Unfortunately I didn't identify any mint here. The base seems to be similar to that in original Allure Homme Sport. So nothing really new or special - I like Bleu more.
It is better than Bleu de chanel,but still nothing groundbreaking.
Generic sporty opening with mediocre drydown, similar to the new Gucci sporty frags.
Scent:5/10
Sillage:7/10
Longevity:7/10
I read it's gonna replace Allure Homme Sport Cologne - my all time fave lemony scent! Pity cause this one sounds very different. It's better be good! And I'll start stocking up on my favourite summer cologne in the meanwhile.

Toyota is up to almost 8% market share in Liechtenstein in 2013…
* See the Top 35 All-brands ranking by clicking on the title! Many thanks to Rutger *
Liechtenstein is a 160 square kilometres principality located between Austria and Switzerland and home to 35,000 inhabitants. Over the first 6 months of 2013, 993 new passenger cars found a buyer in the country, down a harsh 18% year-on-year. Volkswagen is still by far the preferred brand thanks to 171 sales for a 17.2% market share, followed like in 2012 by Audi at 104 units and 10.5% and BMW with 82 sales and 8.3%. Toyota is making some interesting inroads this year, up from 5.6% market share over the full year 2012 to 7.9% now and relegating Mercedes in 5th place at 6%. Opel is up from 3.1% to 4.3% at #7, Suzuki up from 2.1% to 3% at #9, Hyundai up from 1.8% to 3% at #10, Citroen up from 1.5% to 2.7% at #12 and Honda up 1.3% to 2.1% at #15.

Full 6 months 2013 Top 35 All-brands Ranking Table below.I use and chose to review Brewtarget. Brewtarget is and open-source (free!) software which is compatible with Windows, Mac, and Linux operating systems. It utilizes Beer.xml which allows it to be compatible with many of the other brewing softwares - you can easily import/export recipes with friends!
A really important aspect of producing great beer is knowing your system. Brewtarget is highly configurable to meet the needs of your brewery and help you learn your system through the following configurations:
- Equipment - You are able to setup different equipment profiles which will remember your pot sizes, evaporation rates, mash temp initial losses, grain absorption etc.
- Measurements and Formulas - Easily switch between metric and U.S. measurements as well as color formulas (Mosher/Morey/Daniel) and IBU approximations (Rager/Tinsenth)
- Editable Database - Customizing Grains, Yeast, and Hops is very easy on the front-end interface
- Scale Recipe Calculator - Easily adjust a known recipe (like from Brewing classic Styles) based on volume or efficiency. This comes in handy!
- Brewday Help: Software contains a timer, a correction calculator if you miss your OG, a priming and a pitching rate calculator
Pictured below is a screenshot of the recipe tab in Brewtarget showing a Munich Helles I brewed last weekend. As you can see the low and high ends of the BJCP style guidelines are shown to the left (blue) and right (red) of my recipe. If you are within the style guidelines you values will be green. If you are high or low your predicted numbers will turn blue or red. You are also notified of the hop/malt balance of your beer below the colored pint glass. All ingredients in a recipe can be edited directly from the recipe formulation screen
After using Brewtarget for over a year and seeing the updates that have been made since version 1.2.1 (Currently on 1.2.4) I am really impressed with the software. The developer is always willing to promptly help when bugs are encountered and constantly adds new requested functionality to each software revision. The only thing I wish Brewtarget did better was produce a more styled recipe printout for sharing on the web. It currently outputs recipes to your computers clipboard in a basic text/tab delimited output, and its not the most aesthetically pleasing. Other than that I really love the software and suggestion you check it out!

Leave a comment with your thoughts on the different brewing software below.
I haven't happened across BrewTarget before but it looks like a nice slick app and it has as similar feature-set to Brewmate (also a free app). I might have to try it out sometime to see how it stacks up against Brewmate. Just from comparing screenshots one thing I prefer on Brewmate is having all the ingredients on the same screen instead of different tabs for grains, hops, etc.
The text version probably has to be basic without any formatting by default if it's plain text. Brewmate has a similar plain text output but also has an option of 'Forum friendly' output which can include BB code for formatting.
@Aidan I agree Brewmate's ingredients all being in the same location without clicking to a new tab is a nice feature. I do often find myself wanting to know what the hop schedule or yeast was on a recipe without having to click over. It looks to me like design outweighed functionality in this aspect. I feel Brewtargets tabs and use of white space make it look a little cleaner. Whereas, Brewmate is a little more cluttered, but everything is right there and is more functional!
I like 'forum friendly' option Brewmate offers and I will check it out.
I agree with your one negative item on the review. The output of BrewTarget for printing or sharing on the web is a disaster to put it bluntly.
The developers answer was to use 'code' tags when posting on HBT, or use monospaced fonts. The use of monospaced fonts didn't improve the output. I had submitted a bug report to improve the output, and the developer immediately closed it out.
Maybe some more users of BrewTarget can also put in requests for this.
Until THAT improves, I will use Brew Mate.The chili paste is definitely powerful, though take my word for it...you don't want to leave any of it in tupperware all week and then open it to check on it. Practically bowled myself over, and ended up throwing up the whole tupperware with it. Not that it wasn't a good chili paste (it was), but sitting and marinating in its own juices, it just got to be a bit much.
10 large dried chilis
5 shallots, peeled
5 garlic cloves, peeled
t shrimp paste
6T oil
5oz firm tofu, cut into 1" cubes
2 onions, chopped
2 garlic cloves, finely chopped
10 oz skinless chicken breast, sliced
10oz raw shrimp, peeled and deveined (or you can take the lazy route like me, and buy frozen cooked deshelled shrimp)
6 choi sum (or baby bok choy), cut into 1 1/4" lengths (if you buy too much and have leftovers, these are great cooked with a little olive oil and garlic, like spinach)
t tomato puree
T dark soy sauce (following the tradition of this recipe of not having stuff, I got home and realized I didn't have soy sauce (well, it was hiding, but I didn't find it til later), but I didn't want to go out, so I just tried to make do)
lb fresh thin yellow wheat noodles, cut into short pieces (I wouldn't used these next time, because they turned into big balls of doughy substance that wasn't very appetizing, I'd probably use rice noodles)
4 scallions, finely chopped
8oz bean sprouts
juice of 1 lime
salt and pepper
To make the chili paste - soak the dried chilis in boiling water for 20 minutes until softened. Seed and finely chop (unless you're paranoid of chili oil getting on your face, like me, and you just chop them up without seeding them because you don't want to risk the small chance that any tiny microdot of chili oil will get on skin). Using a mortar and pestle, pound the chilis, shallots (it helps to chopp these first, unless you have shoulders of steel), and garlic into a paste. Add the shrimp paste and 2T f water and mix. Heat T oil over medium-high heat and cook the paste 3-4 minutes, stirring constantly. Transfer to a bowl.
Heat the remaining oil and fry the tofu 3-4 minutes until golden brown. Remove from the pan with a slotted spoon and set aside in a bowl. Add the onion and garlic to the oil and cook for 2 minutes until fragrant. Add the chicken and cook for another 2-3 minutes. Add the shrimp and choi sum.
Add T of the chili paste, tomato puree, 1/2 cup water, and soy sauce, and bring to a simmer. Add the noodles and cook for 3 minutes. Add scallion, bean sprouts and tofu. Adjust seasoning with salt, black pepper, and add a little lime juice.

The German attacker has not finished a full 90 minutes since the second leg of the Gunners’ Champions League elimination at the hands of Bayern Munich in early March in what has been a frustrating time for the club.
Although he has started regularly, Podolski is often taken off by Wenger, and was again withdrawn in the FA Cup semi-final against Wigan on Saturday during the second-half.
Although he was thrilled to see his side eventually go on to book their spot in the tournament’s showpiece tie, he said that the situation in which he currently finds himself is one that his frustrating him:
“I play and in the last games, I always come out and of course you cannot be happy when you always go out after 60, 70 minutes,” he is quoted by The Metro.

//);.Battles of Saratoga
There were two principal problems with Burgoyne's plan. First, it took little account of logistics and, second, it depended heavily on simultaneous execution. It was further hampered by the fact that, while he was approving Burgoyne's plan, Germain also approved a different plan submitted by Major General William Howe. Howe proposed to move south from New York against Philadelphia. He believed that Continental Army commander General George Washington would have to commit the bulk of his army to defend the capital and that the rebel army might thus be destroyed.
Germain made no effort to reconcile these two plans. Neither did he order the two commanders to cooperate. Neither Howe nor Burgoyne made any effort to coordinate with the other, although Howe did inform British commander in Canada Major General Sir Guy Carleton of his intentions. Howe promised to position a corps in the lower Hudson River area to maintain communications through the Highlands, which might then "act in favor of the northern army." Later this force went up the Hudson to a point above Hyde Park. Although Burgoyne saw this letter, it did not affect his planning.
Burgoyne and the main British force assembled at Saint Jean, south of Montreal. Lieutenant Colonel Barry St. Leger led the secondary effort at Lachine. St. Leger had only 875 British, Loyalist, and Hessian troops, assisted by 1,000 Iroquois Indians under Joseph Brant. This force struck from Oswego into the Mohawk Valley, but the Indian massacre of civilians produced a widespread mobilization of militia, supported by units of the Continental Army under Major General Benedict Arnold. Although St. Leger's force campaigned on the Mohawk during July 25–August 25, much of this time was spent in a fruitless siege of Fort Stanwix (Fort Schuyler, present-day Rome, New York), and they never joined Burgoyne.
Howe, meanwhile, left about one-third of his army under Major General Sir Henry Clinton to garrison New York and put to sea with some 16,000 men, sailing to the head of the Chesapeake Bay to approach Philadelphia from the south. Washington shifted his army to central New Jersey so he could act in either direction. As Burgoyne moved deeper into upper New York from Canada, however, Washington detached some of his best troops and most capable commanders to reinforce that front. The opportunity to cut off and destroy a British army away from Royal Navy support was simply too tempting. Once Howe's intent was clear, Washington had ample time to move south and protect Philadelphia. The Continental Army met defeat in the Battle of Brandywine Creek on September 11, 1777, but it managed to withdraw in good order. By the end of September, Howe had seized Philadelphia, but it was a hollow victory, devoid of military significance.
Burgoyne now faced a difficult decision. After capturing Fort Ticonderoga in early July, he had advanced slowly. By early August he knew Howe would not be reinforcing him and that St. Leger had been blocked. He also knew that winter would freeze over his Lake Champlain supply line, and communications to Canada were threatened by colonial actions against Fort Ticonderoga. Then, on August 16, Burgoyne suffered a disaster in the Battle of Bennington. He had detached a sizable force of Hessian mercenaries to secure provisions, and the American militia cut off and surrounded them at Bennington (in present-day Vermont). The British lost 207 killed and 696 captured, versus American casualties of only 30 killed and wounded. The Americans also secured supplies and weapons.
Burgoyne had only 30 days of provisions for his 7,000 men, some 2,000 women, and a number of children who accompanied the troops. Local supplies were practically non-existent due to the work of Major General Philip Schuyler, commander of the Northern Department and the unsung hero of the campaign. Burgoyne's long supply lines and Schuyler's skillfully planned retreat (after he had destroyed the countryside) were the keys to the campaign. Schuyler's continued withdrawals and aloof manner made him unpopular with his men, however. With Major General Horatio Gates also intriguing against him, Congress relieved Schuyler of command on August 19 and replaced him with Gates, who subsequently quarreled with Arnold.
The Indians in Burgoyne's service also helped to create hostility against the British. This included the scalping of a white woman, ironically the fiancée of a British officer. Gates played this up with great success. Burgoyne did not understand this, and indeed inflamed the situation by threatening Indian reprisals against resisting Americans, which served to bring out militia in large numbers. Later, anticipating disaster, the Indians melted away, a serious loss for the British in gathering intelligence on American dispositions.
Burgoyne's advance, impeded at every turn by the Americans and slowed by the need to construct dozens of bridges and causeways across swamps and creeks, now was only a mile a day. On September 13–14 the British crossed to the west side of the Hudson River on a bridge of rafts. The troops at last reached Saratoga, only a few miles from their goal of Albany, but found their way blocked in a series of battles for control of the main Albany road. Collectively known as the Battles of Saratoga, these were: Freeman's Farm, or First Saratoga; and Bemis Heights, or Second Saratoga.
The Battle of Freeman's Farm occurred on the afternoon of September 19. Some 6,000 Americans, their right flank anchored on the Hudson River, had established a fortified position of redoubts and breastworks on Bemis Heights, south of a 15-acre clearing known as Freeman's Farm. Burgoyne opened the battle when he ordered three regiments to attack across the clearing and dislodge the Americans from Bemis Heights. The British attack went poorly. Brigadier General Daniel Morgan and Arnold halted the advance, with Morgan's riflemen inflicting heavy casualties on the British, especially officers. Fortunately for Burgoyne, Gates refused to leave his entrenchments to support Arnold and Morgan. Hessian forces turned the American right flank and that night the British encamped in the field, but they had failed to dislodge the Americans on Bemis Heights, the object of their attack. The British had also sustained some 600 casualties to only 300 for the Americans.
The Americans were now reinforced and, by the time of the second battle, Gates had some 11,500 men to only 6,617 for Burgoyne. At a council of war on October 5, Burgoyne's officers pressed him to retreat while there was still an opportunity, but he steadfastly refused and ordered a full-scale attack to turn the American flank. This prompted the second battle on October 7. Gates committed Morgan's riflemen on the British right flank. Brigadier General Ebenezer Learned's brigade was in the center, and Brigadier General Enoch Poor's brigade on the left. Gates's refusal to commit his entire force mitigated the British defeat, but Arnold, who had quarreled with Gates and been removed from command, disregarded orders and charged onto the field to lead a general American assault that took two British redoubts. The Americans sustained only about 130 casualties to 600 for the British.
On October 8 Burgoyne ordered a general retreat, only to find the Americans had blocked that possibility. On October 17, aware that Clinton would be unable to relieve him, Burgoyne formally surrendered his army of 5,895 officers and men. Gates granted the British paroles on condition that they not serve again in America, an action Congress subsequently disallowed. Burgoyne was eventually cleared of any misconduct but it was the end of his military career.
The British lost not only at Saratoga but also Ticonderoga and the Highlands as well. All they had to show for the year's campaigning was the occupation of Philadelphia. The war now became a major issue in British politics. More important, the Battle of Saratoga caused France to enter the war openly. On December 4 Benjamin Franklin, in Paris as an ambassador for the colonists, received the news of Burgoyne's surrender; two days later King Louis XVI approved an alliance with the United States. A treaty was signed on February 6, 1778, and on March 11 Great Britain and France were at war.
For two years, France had been actively assisting the rebels with substantial quantities of military supplies, but the actual entry of France into the war was a threat to every part of the British Empire. The war then became largely a problem of sea power, accentuated when in 1779 Spain declared war on England, followed by Holland in 1780. Participation of French Army regiments in concert with the French Navy made possible the defeat of the British Army in America.

McKinley, R-Wheeling, quoted EPA information acknowledging indoor air can be as much as 96 times more harmful to a person's health than outdoor air because items within an enclosed home can emit potentially dangerous gases including formaldehyde, while cleaning products used indoors often contain ammonia.
McKinley said he will consider creating legislation that could require the labeling of home furnishings and items that emit harmful gases so people know they pose health hazards. That measure would come as he seeks to overturn environmental regulations affecting the coal industry and coal-fired power plants.
"We're going to try to craft something on indoor air quality to make sure the environmentalists having a field day with coal, oil and gas understand that's not all there is," he said. "There are other issues that could be contributing when we get sick ... I'm trying to deflect attention away from our manufacturers. Maybe they're not the ones causing the problem, but yet we're forcing them to do something beyond necessary."
He noted statistics indicate Americans spend 90 percent of their time indoors, and 60 percent of that time is within their own homes.
"I want to ask the EPA, how do you know when we get sick it's not from indoor air?" McKinley said. "Why are we continuing to attack our employers, our manufacturers, our coal-fired generating power houses and shutting them down when we're getting sick - maybe (from outdoor air). When I get sick and can't go to work, is it from formaldehyde exposure? I don't know.
"I don't want the EPA to come in my office or come in my home. I just want recognition that it's not because we're burning coal that we're getting sick. It could be indoor air quality. We're making ourselves sick ...."."

Premier Soccer League champions Orlando Pirates have signed Zambian and former Kaizer Chiefs striker Collins Mbesuma on a three-year deal.
Collins Mbesuma during the Orlando Pirates training session. (Gallo)
"It is not going to be easy because Pirates have good strikers, but I will do my best," Mbesuma told the City Press.
"It means there is something special about me. But that does not mean I have to relax. I still have to prove myself.
"I want to be successful with Pirates and win things with them. I think I need competition and I know Pirates is a big team so I just want to compete," he added.
Pirates coach Augusto Palacios said the Zambian striker was the last signing for the season.
"Collins is the last player coming to Pirates to strengthen the squad for the PSL and Africa campaigns. We take this very seriously," said Palacios.
Mbesuma has played for Kaizer Chiefs, Mamelodi Sundowns and Moroka Swallows.
Mbesuma made his debut for Zambia in 2003.
Kaizer Chiefs bought him in January 2004 from Roan United in Zambia.
Mbesuma was named PSL Player of the Season in 2005 after scoring 35 goals in one season with Kaizer Chiefs.
He then caught the attention of Bolton Wanderers and Portsmouth but he failed to secure a deal with the English clubs.Actions

The distance does not matter to me. I understand how important it is to have a picture of a loved one's resting spot....especially your mom. We did have some difficulty finding her and had to get the groundskeepers to assist and they too were unable to locate her. This was with plot information! The directions were obviously not that good. Eventually, my boyfriend was able to locate your mom's resting place...I was getting a little worried. I am so glad we could help. While out there, I located a couple of other photo requests from members. Never a wasted day...I absolutely love helping others connect with their love ones.

They're banning smoking cause second-hand smoke kills. Nobody every got a bad liver from someone else's drinking... Besides DWI alone, is enough reason for someone to want to ban drinking, - forget about anti-smoking laws.
I think the real sensible thing to do is to leave the decision of "smoking" or "no smoking" up to the pub owners.

, after it is Govt which is making money out of ciggerette.
If Govt is that much concerned about health of public then why not it simply ban the cigerette ?
Originally posted by Paul Sturrock I whole-heartedly applaud the outright ban. I can't see any justification for smoking in the presence of non-smokers. Its just not fair on them.

My father always beat me. He'd put me over his knee and use his belt, a hazel stick (broke multiple) or his hand.
Eventually this didn't work anymore and it was the other way around. Except I didn't use those kids toys.

No! You're fine, bro. It's helping either way. This is where the mods are, IMHO, greatly confused because they were instructed by some upper authority that ALL trolling is bad. When in fact it's not.
Now OP can look through this thread and say, "Boy oh Boy! I sure did get trolled! I wonder why? OH. I see now. Perhaps I should be more careful with the topic of discussion next time, and maybe google the question first, THEN I can ask unbiased questions later if I reasonable feel my question justifies anything. If I still get trolled at least I can provide an explanation to show how my question was generated in the first place."

Hello, my name is Jane Oestreich and I am the principal of Hickey Elementary School. I hold a Bachelor of Science in Education Degree from Central Michigan University, as well as a Master's Degree in Educational Administration and a second Master's Degree in Elementary Education, both from the University of North Texas. I am starting my 16th year working for the district. My husband and I have lived in Plano for 19 years and we have two children who successfully completed their K-12 education in Plano.
Our school song states, "Hickey Elementary is the best school in the world", and that is how I feel about being at this school. We have high expectations for learning at Hickey. I marvel daily about the talented teaching staff, the delightful and respectful students, and the extraordinary families that are at our school each day. Your children are fortunate to have the Hickey staff assist them as they develop lifelong learner and 21st century skills. It is a joy to come to school each day and work with such wonderful students, parents, staff, and community.
Thank you for sharing your children with me each school day.<<

Hit Men and Groove Kings kick off Summer Concert Series
This summer Shirley Sisk Grove will once again come to life with the sound of music. Shaded by lush trees, the grove will be home to Newark's annual on-the-green summer concert series.This year's "Music at the Grove" will kick off with a performance by the Bay Area's Hit Men on July 13. Performers since 1995, the Hit Men are a "nine-member powerhouse" who play hits from the 70s, 80s, and modern day hip-hop. The Groove Kings, who will perform on July 27, will also showcase a wide repertoire including a variety of rock songs and classic R&B. The last concert, featuring the Fundamentals, will be a high-energy "party" finale to the concert series. This popular band will play songs in genres from Motown to Funk, and R&B to Soul.According to David Zehnder, who heads the concert series project, "the purpose of the Music at the Grove concert series is to offer family entertainment appealing to all musical tastes." Sponsored by Target, Comcast, Homewood Suites and Cargill, Music at the Grove is the answer to Newark's vision of "a free summer concert series that would provide the local community with quality musical entertainment in a relaxed outdoor setting."In contrast to previous years, this year's show will be limited to three concerts. Financial concerns and city budget issues are responsible for the limited length of the series. Due to inadequate funds, organizers of the event will be asking for financial support through a "passing of the hat" at each concert. Zehnder, who applauds the success of the concerts in bringing music to the community, commented that he does not "anticipate holding the concert series next summer unless we are successful in raising enough funds this summer and throughout next year."So pack a picnic, bring a blanket, put away your iPods, and come out to see music live. For more than twenty years, Music at the Grove has been bringing sweet sounds of music to Newark, and with support, will return again next summer. Do not miss this opportunity to see some of the Bay Area's most popular bands on stage!July 13 - Hit Men (70's to Modern)July 27 - The Groove Kings (R&B/Soul)August 10 - The Fundamentals (R&B)Newark Summer Concert SeriesSundays at 1:30 p.m.Shirley Sisk GroveCedar Blvd. at New Park Mall, Newark(510) 578-4400[JUR of United Nations Organization Stabilization Mission in the Democratic Republic of Congo (MONUSCO) [official website], said that new threats have materialized in new areas, including the Maniema and Katanga provinces, and there is "a very limited opportunity to respond to them."

Clarkson Student Is Gates Millennium Scholar
Tracelyn N. Gumbs of Bronx, N.Y., a senior business major at Clarkson University, was recently selected as a Gates Millennium Scholar. Gumbs is on a co-op with IBM this fall.
“The Gates Scholarship is an outstanding recognition and opportunity for Ms. Gumbs,” said Clarkson University President Denny Brown. “We celebrate her hard work and commitment to those aspirations, and we wish her continued success as she completes her academic career at Clarkson.”
The Gates Millennium Scholar award is a full scholarship, and will continue until Gumbs completes her graduate degree.
Funded by a grant from the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation last September, the Gates Millennium Scholars initiative is aimed at increasing the number of low-income, high achieving African-Americans, American Indians/Alaskan Natives, Hispanic Americans and Asian-Pacific-Americans enrolling in and completing undergraduate and graduate degree programs. The program is administered by the United Negro College Fund in partnership with the American Indian College Fund, Hispanic Scholarship Fund and the Organization of Chinese Americans, who represent the Asian-Pacific-American Community.
Gumbs says Professor Mike Ensby, director of the Interdisciplinary Engineering and Management (IE&M) program, was extremely instrumental in helping her receive the award. Ensby was impressed with Gumbs’ presentations and essays— she was the only student that he nominated for the award.
“Professor Ensby encouraged me to stay at Clarkson for graduate school,” said Gumbs, who transferred to Clarkson from Westchester Community College. “He has been a mentor and a friend. He is a wonderful person.”
Gumbs also received support and a letter of recommendation from the vice president of Westchester Community College. While attending Westchester Community College, Gumbs was very involved in several extracurricular activities, including: president of Alpha Beta Gamma, the business honor fraternity; budget chair for the Student Senate; liaison to the Westchester Consortium on Racial Diversity and a volunteer for Pious XII, a group which helps young teens with issues including family problems and teen pregnancy.
While here at Clarkson University, Gumbs has been awarded both the Foundation for Accounting Education Scholarship and the Texaco Scholarship, and serves as a volunteer for the Potsdam Nutrition Center.
Presently, Gumbs is completing a co-op work experience with IBM in Southbury, Conn., where she works as a cash accountant. “Right now,” said Gumbs, “I am working 40 hours per week, taking four classes, and studying for the GMATs.”
“I am truly blessed,” said Gumbs. Not a day goes by where I don’t give thanks. I thank my mother for all of the sacrifices that she has made for me and all of the values that she has instilled within.Saturday, January 1, 2011

Contributing Monkie Vanessa Sherwood
Published on October 16, 2006
Filed Under GreenChef Foodie Talk Tags Concord Grapes
The days and nights are slowly getting cooler. Soon the leaves will start to change colors for fall is in the air. This is also the time of year when Concord grapes will make an appearance in the stores, if you’re lucky. To me, the Concord grape is the king of all grapes. They are big, dark blue or purple, and are highly aromatic. Concord grapes have been known to reduce hypertension and the negative side effects of secondhand smoke. The purple little powerhouse can also safeguard your heart by lowering the levels of LDH (the bad cholesterol), keeping your arteries elastic and by reducing the clumping of platelets. Just a few reasons to try them, if the fabulous taste wasn’t enough.
This is the time of year I start to get homesick for Upstate New York, second largest producer of Concord grapes. I lived near the small town of Naples, famous for their grape pies. Every year a contest is held to see whos pie reigns supreme. Monica, of monicaspies.com has probably won the most contests and has even been featured on The Food Network. You can order a pie online, or try your hand at making your own.
Here’s a link to a blog dedicated to the Finger Lakes Region of Upstate New York, with a recipe for grape pieOVERLAND PARK, Kan.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Tallgrass Energy Partners, LP (NYSE: TEP) ("TEP" or the “Partnership”) today announced that Jeffrey R. Armstrong has been appointed to the Board of Directors of TEP’s general partner, effective as of April 2, 2014. From 2001 until late 2013, Mr. Armstrong was employed by Kinder Morgan and held various positions within the company including Vice President of Corporate Strategy and President of the Terminals division.
David G. Dehaemers, Jr., President and CEO of TEP’s general partner, said: "We are extremely pleased to be adding Jeff Armstrong to the Board. Jeff has extensive experience as it relates both to general corporate strategy and specifically to the terminals business. His insight and perspective will be invaluable as the Partnership continues to grow its midstream businesses."
Prior to 2001, Mr. Armstrong was employed by GATX Corporation where he held various commercial and operational roles including General Manager of the company’s east coast operations.

With the Big Four finally coming together, the most rocking of genres is seeing some black days ahead, which is good, because they like that kind of stuff. But other than crazy huge excuses to thrash violently, metal may have another reason to celebrate: Black Sabbath is considering a reunion.
Now before you get out the face paint and studded bracelets, it’s not going to be for some time (if at all). In an interview with MassLive.com (via AntiMusic.com), frontman Ozzy Osbourne said he and guitarist Tony Iommi had worked out their legal issues regarding who owns the Black Sabbath name and are actually, gasp, being friendly.
When then asked about the possibility of a Black Sabbath reunion, Osbourne did not shoot the idea, but instead said that it’d have to wait at least a year or two while he does his solo album and subsequent touring. But if it were to happen, Osbourne has some pretty lofty intentions.
“We never set down when we were kids and went like, ‘This is going to be looked upon when we’re (expletive) 60 as a milestone in music.’ That was not our intention,” Osbourne said. “But it kind of happened. I always wanted to be a Beatle and people said, ‘Well Black Sabbath is a heavy metal version of the Beatles.’ But I would love to do, absolutely love to do a really great, monumental Black Sabbath album.”
We have never wanted something more to happen than a metal Beatles. Or would that be a Beatles-esque Sabbath. Either way, we hope it comes sooner rather than later. As always, though, stay tuned for more news as it’s announced.March 2010
Field Office Post-Entitlement Workload Statistics
(A-04-10-21047)
Objective
To (1) determine. DOWR data used in conjunction with other workload analysis tools enables SSA management to measure staff and other resources expended on field office workloads.
To view the full report, visit
Our Findings
SSA management analyzed DOWR data at a national and regional level; however, this analysis did not always focus on, or identify, anomalous trends at specific field offices. r egional o ffices (Dallas, New York, and San Francisco) stated they had not identified the significant changes in the three workloads we tested. However, SSA regional officials generally provided reasonable explanations for the significant increases in the three workloads we examined.
Matters for Consideration
DOWR statistics provide management with a useful tool for monitoring field office workloads. .To ensure SSA management identifies significant changes in all workload statistics, which may indicate potential problems in workloads or a need for employee training, we believe SSA should consider requiring regional offices to develop workload trend statistics for all DOWR categories for each of their respective field offices. From this data, SSA should identify and investigate significant workload anomalies.
SSA agreed that regional offices should develop DOWR trend statistics for each of their respective field offices and stated that it will work to implement this practice.They are widely criticised as unhealthy junk food, but many of us cannot live without them. Love ’em or hate ’em, you cannot deny fast food culture is firmly a part of our life now. Here is a brief history of how fast food conquered Singapore.
A&W (Alan and Wright) was the first ever American fast food chain to operate business in Singapore. It was 1966, a year after the independence of our nation, when A&W launched their business at Dunearn Road.
The chain expanded fast, and arguably hit its peak in the early nineties, before declining due to fierce competitions from rival fast food chains which arrived at Singapore at a later time. Its branch at Singapore Zoo was closed in 1999; by 2002, A&W had only 7 outlets here. A year later, its Singapore operation finally ended after it shut down its last outlet at Hougang Heartland Mall.
Curly fries and root beer float in frosted mugs are distant memories now, and so were the once-popular A&W restaurants at Ang Mo Kio and Bukit Merah centrals.
Kentucky Fried Chicken (KFC) arrived at Singapore in 1977 with its very first restaurant at Somerset Road.
Currently operating almost 70 outlets in Singapore, the finger-lickin’ good chicken has charmed many Singaporeans for more than 30 years. 1988 and 1993 marked the important years for KFC Singapore as they launched their signature burgers in Colonel Burger and the popular Zinger.
In the late eighties, KFC restaurants, such as the evergreen branch at Thomson Plaza, served their meals with metal knifes and forks. The drinks were refillable too.
Kentucky Fried Chicken rebranded itself worldwide as KFC in 1991, not because of the rumoured mutated chicken, but rather the word “Fried” did not go well with the increasingly health-conscious consumers.
On 27th October 1979, fast food giant McDonald’s became the third American fast food chain to venture into Singapore. It broke the world record on its very first day of opening at Liat Towers, Orchard Road, when it served the most burgers in a single day (the record was broken by McDonald’s Beijing in the nineties). In May 1984, McDonald’s opened its first HDB neighbourhood outlet at Hougang, and in 1996, it became the first fast food restaurant to operate in a community centre, at Hong Kah CC.
As the most popular and successful fast food chain in Singapore, McDonald’s has over 120 outlets all over the island, with 18 of them going 24-hour operation since 2005.
McDonald’s highly successful marketing strategy has charmed Singaporeans over the decades. Since its introduction of collectable figurines for the promotion of its Happy Meals and Extra Value Meals in 1995, phenomenon sightings started to appear in many parts of the island as Singaporeans rushed to queue for the collectibles.
101 dalmatians, Snoopy, Pooh and Friends were big hits, but the Hello Kitty craze in 2000 truly dominated the headlines, both for the right and wrong reasons. During the 40-day promotion, hundreds of thousands of Singaporeans queued up for the soft toys in the first two days. Fist fights, shattered glass door due to over-congestion and even rioting happened in various outlets, resulting in dozens being arrested. In the end, McDonald’s sold 2.8 million toys, a record remains till this day, and queuing officially became the favourite past-time of Singaporeans.
The crave for pizzas and pastas began when Pizza Hut started operating at Jalan Jelita, Holland Road as early as 1981. Since then, it has grown to become the largest pizza chain restaurant today with 48 outlets. Pizza Hut’s success is also due to its concept of making home deliveries, which began in 1986.
Under franchise agreements, Burger King landed in Singapore in 1982 with its first restaurant at Peninsula Plaza. Singapore was the second stop of Burger King’s expansion into Asia; the first being Hong Kong in the late seventies.
In 1983, fried seafood specialist Long John Silver’s was the next to arrive, eager to share the local market pie which proved to be successful ventures by A&W, McDonald’s and KFC. In the same year, French-styled bakery Délifrance made its debut here, but started with only wholesale catering for hotels, supermarkets and clubs. It was not until 1985 when it launched its first Café bakery at Clifford Centre, Raffles Place, followed by its first Le Bristo at Robinson Towers in 1989.
Milano’s Pizza, operating by franchisee, opened here in 1984 in a bid to compete with Pizza Hut. It never had considerable success, outmuscled by its rival Pizza Hut in the marketing arena. By mid-nineties, the pizza chain could not survive and some of its outlets were closed down, whereas the remaining were acquired by another rival Domino’s Pizza.
Wendy’s (Old Fashioned Hamburgers), another American burger chain, also established its foothold in Singapore in the eighties, having outlets in Far East Plaza (picture below) and Parkway Parade. It exited the local market years later but the franchise has since been brought back to Singapore by the Kopitiam Group in 2009.
Old school American fast food restaurant-cum-entertainment center Chuck E Cheese was a popular hangout for many at Parkway Parade in the eighties. Children could play various games at the Fantasy Playland after having their fast food treats.
A couple of fast food chains, like Wendy’s, have exited Singapore and are able to make a comeback here, such as Domino’s Pizza, Dunkin’ Donuts and Texas Fried Chicken. But many others did not survive due to the intense competition or
franchising issues. Taco Bell, Denny’s, Mary Brown’s (Canadian fast food chain), Wimply’s, Shakey’s Pizza, Big Ro
oster (Australian fast food chain), Hardee’s, Jack in the Box, Jollibee (Phillippines fast food chain) and Mr Potato are the examples.
Taco Bell has its operation here for a couple of years, mainly as combination stores with KFC, with its most prominent one at the Funan Digital Life Mall. However, it exited Singapore in 2008, as Mexican food such as nachos and tacos did not make their ways onto Singaporeans’ favourite food list.
American sandwich giant Subway made their venture in Singapore in 1996 with their first outlet at Lau Pa Sat. Having expanded to some 90 stores islandwide, its concept of healthy and customised variation of sandwiches has gained popularity among the locals.
Other minor players in our fast food industry include Spizza, DaPaolo, Carl’s Jr, O’Briens Irish Sandwich Bar (entered Singapore in 1999) and Popeyes (first outlet at Changi Airport in 2001).
Another fast food chain worth mentioning is Singapore-based Komala’s Restaurants, which serves Indian vegetarian food in fast food self-service setting. It was founded by Murugiah Rajoo way back in 1947, and has enjoyed reasonable success for more than 50 years, operating as many as 10 outlets in various parts of Singapore. It also has five overseas branches in Canada, Thailand and India.

that macca’s photo sure brings back memories. do you remember big rooster (located at the building next to the current H&M)
jaune
Hi Jaune, I read that Big Rooster was taken over by Red Rooster (Australia) in 1992. I didn’t have the chance to taste it, but have read the not-so-positive reviews of its roasted chicken :D
I sure miss the A&W in Bukit Merah!
Love the root beer floats!!!
Found your blog by accident and love it ;)
Thanks! Your photos of Greece are amazing, especially the sunset ones
My dad came home one afternoon, some time in the mid 70s, and said he was bringing me to have american fastfood, a hamburger, to be precise. We drove off from Toa Payoh Blk 124, where we lived to Robinson Road’s A&W. I had my first hamburger and frosty big mug of root beer. I must have been about 4 or 5.
I’ve been trying to recall the name of that amusement park cum restaurant in Parkway Parade… thanks for bringing the name up – Chuck E Cheese!
If I remember, they have those huge animatronics characters right?
yep.. and Parkway Parade was such a happening place in the 80s and 90s :D
I am still a frequent at Parkway Parade! But I do miss Parkway Parade’s older days – when I was younger, in the early 90s.
Agreed, Parkway was so happening – I still go down there a bit (still a Katong boy at heart) and I also miss Hardee’s. My 1st Mushroom & Swiss was at Hardee’s and my dad’s favourite was the roast beef sandwich – (slogan: sliced thin piled high). By the way, Wendy’s chilli used to taste much better back then and they provided hot sauce and crackers with it.
I lived in Telok Blangah (close to Bukit Merah) so I definitely remembered the A&W there! My Dad used to bring me there for coney dogs and root beer floats. Memories…
Anyone else remember that Kentucky Fried Chicken (before they renamed it to KFC) actually provided you with metal knives and forks to eat?
And there was also another short-lived fast food outlet: Texas Fried Chicken. I actually preferred Texas Fried Chicken to KFC because the chicken was fried in a crispy way…this was when KFC only had original recipe chicken before they switched to hot and spicy/crispy chicken. There was a Texas Fried Chicken outlet at Bukit Merah…loved it.
As i recall….
The current KFC at Bukit Merah Central WAS Texas Fried Chicken before they closed and KFC took over wasn’t it..?
Oh yes, I had KFC with fork and knife! I still remember I was then with my uncle’s family at the KFC Toa Payoh central…
Yes i remember. I joined Kentucky Fried Chicken in 1981 as a waiter (starting at Malayan Credit House at Somerset Road, but worked in many other branches too) and we served the food using melamine plates and metal cutlery. The uniform for male waiters was all white shirt with a black bow tie, white pants and white shoes and a paper hat. We sometimes carried 4 – 5 plates of chicken with our left hands. Plain water was free and we would top up the customers’ glasses as needed. Sometimes we had “runaway bill”, when patrons left without paying. But sometimes customers also left tips on the wooden bill tray. One of the things we faced was that crumbs would accumulate in the groove of the wooden chairs and we would use brushes to clean them out. Also, the tables had numbers on the sides (we used spray paint for this) and metal bases and we would sometimes use metal polishers to shine them. The Arnold’s restaurant at City Plaza was started by a person who was my restaurant manager at Somerset. At least that was the impression I got when I talked to him after checking out the restaurant soon after it opened.
Leslie, Thanks for the interesting post. Yes, I remembered eating at Kentucky with metal cutlery too. Now, if I am at a food court that uses plastic cutlery, I wont patronise the chicken rice stalls or roti prata stall as I dont enjoy eating those food without metal cutlery.
I miss A&W & Denny’s.. Used to go Denny’s for breakfast after working at Regent Hotel night shift when I was a teen.
Whenever I go BKK now, I’ll be sure to visit A&W and eat their curly fries and the big mug of Rootbeer Float :)
A & W’s at Siam Square..? hehehe
thank u for the memories! i remember my fav hangouts with great fondness: wendy’s at far east, n hardee’s at parkway. n top of the list fastfood was always coney dog n rootbeer floats fm a&w :)
Does anyone remember the A&W that was along Dunearn Road/Bukit Timah Road? Beside the huge storm drains? I remember my first trip there. The root beer float in an actual frosty mug, of course and those waffles! All with actual cutlery and plates, none of the disposable stuff.
Looks like most people miss the good ‘old A&W :D
Hope they can bring it back someday..
does it make you feel old just going down memory lane?? anyway they are happy memories…
I miss A&W too… I also liked Orange Julius (and their hotdogs) that was at the old Cathay cinema back when I was studying at mt Sophia. What about Ponderosa and it’s salad buffet? I remember that’s the only thing I can afford on the menu in my student days and good value (since buffet mah)… Guess now there’s sizzlers but ponderosa had much better selection IMO.. There’s also Arnold’s in city plaza, pays lebar, a Malay-run fried chicken fast food. Always loved the fried spring chicken. And Waffletown in Bt Timah shopping centre… Best mashed potatos!
Thanks for all these great articles that brings back tons of wonderful memories!
I think there’s still a Ponderosa restaurant at Raffles City…
last time we loved to call it “盘大肉少” :D
hi, Arnold’s is owned by 2 Chinese men, who were featured in TV some time in 2010/2011, though their customers are mostly Malays due to its location near Geylang Serai…
Thanks for bringing back fun-filled memories of so many fast food places I enjoyed visiting when I was a kid – I had forgotten about places like Hardee’s, Shakey’s, Chuck E Cheese and Big Rooster but once you listed them, the happy memories came back :-)
I remember A&W at Dunearn Road in the 1970s was a real drive-in (not a drive-thru). My dad would park his car outside the restaurant and a waitress would fit a tray on the window so we could enjoy our Baby burgers, Mama burgers, Papa burgers, Coney dogs and Root Beers sitting in the car. We enjoyed the whole novelty of it (though it would probably have been more comfortable eating inside the restaurant!)
My earliest memory of Pizza Hut was in 1981 at People’s Park Centre. At that time, it was a fast-food concept – order at the counter and they had small (single serve) pizzas in white styra-foam boxes (the kind that McDonald’s used to have for its burgers). The small serving and affordable price (<$3) was perfect for us so my family used to go quite often. Some months later, Pizza Hut opened a new concept at Jelita as a sit down restaurant, with bigger sized pizzas for sharing and more flavours. By that time, we were big fans of Pizza Hut so continued visiting them at their new location.
i was in bali over the weekend and we all hired a van and took a 45 min ride to the town just so we could have an A&W’s root beer float, coney dog and waffle. brought tears to my eyes…
I remember the A and W at thompson…..Now taken over by S eleven if I am not wrong……..I remember there was a cinema opposite it…..Always wanted to explore it when I was young but did not……..Wat a waste….Anyone remember it?
OH my gosh! YES YES YES! I am a Thomson girl, and you just reminded me of the A&W there!! It was there as early as 1990!!! I was in school back then, and used to meet my sister at the A&W!! I really miss A&W, and i always had the coney dog, coke, and an ice cup – which was a scoop of vanilla ice cream with choc sauce!! And yes the cinema opposite – i remember that too, but that closed down years before to make way for Sin Ming Plaza – it’s beside the Thomson CC. Singapore changes too much!
Anyone remembered the playground by MacDonald’s at East Coast ? Its next to MacDonald’s. They have the MacDonald’s characters in the playground. Each time, after a meal there, we will go to the playground.

Over at our neighbouring country Malaysia, Mcdonald’s opened its first ever branch at Bukit Bintang in 1982
Gosh what sweet memories! I remember my parents would not allow me to eat at BK or Pizza Hut when it first came to SG, cos they weren’t certified Halal yet. Can’t recall when most of these restaurants became Halal-certified; so growing up during the 90s and missing out on all those yummy food was MISERABLE haha. Thankfully, children nowadays won’t “suffer” the same extent I did (at least for those with this dietary regulations).. But then again, they probably never get to taste coney dogs and curly fries.. *packs bags for Batam weekend to A&W*
there was an A&W in Clementi Central too. i used to frequent there in my childhood 20+ years back…
Another old photo of the A&W Restaurant at Bukit Merah central (1980s)
Very happy to see mentions of Wimpy and especially Hardee’s :)) I love Hardee’s at Parkway Parade! It was the most “restaurant” of all the fast food restaurants if you know what I mean:) Would be great if can find photos of it!! Loved the big cookie and the southern fried chicken n biscuits!
Root beer float!
Have to order this during my trip to Batam :)
Jollibee is back, though.
After more than a decade, the McDonald’s Hello Kitty craze is back in Singapore… Apparently other than long queues at the various outlets, there are reported quarrels and fights for the limited edition “The Singing Bone” Hello Kitty 8-O
(Source: The Straits Times)
Hundreds across Singapore queue for limited edition Hello Kitty
Long queues were spotted outside McDonald’s outlets islandwide as customers jostled for the special edition black Hello Kitty launched at midnight.
Queues for the Singing Bone Kitty started as early as 8pm at some outlets and reached almost 300 by 11pm at an Ang Mo Kio branch. Each customer was limited to four toys per transaction.
Bring Danny and AW back to Singapore
I LOVE YOUR BLOG! I miss A&W, was just reminded that there was one on Upper Thomson Rd – how I wish I could see a photo of it! Sigh…….. i went there many times as a school girl, to wait for my sister. Sigh.
i had no idea that Chuck E Cheese was in SG!! I wonder why it didn’t last cos in US it’s MEGA HUGE!!!!! And I didn’t know we had Big Rooster or that it’s Red Rooster – I lived in Perth and LOVE Red Rooster!!
BTW, is that photo of Milano Pizza from Serangoon Gardens? Opposite Chomp Chomp? That’s the one i remember going to – and the one in Thomson Plaza – as a schoolgirl, long time ago.
I had no idea Denny’s closed – after clubbing as a teenager, we used to go there for supper! And I also had no idea Taco Bell left SG shores! I LOVE mexican food but they were a bit pricey but always so stingy with their fillings – i think that’s why they didn’t last.
Thanks again for this walk down memory lane!!! It’s wonderful to remember these things, makes my heart ache a bit, but it’s good to remember!!
And yeah i too thought i saw jollibee here now?!?
Another view of the McDonald’s at Liat Towers 1980s
A&W Family Restaurant 1980s… Anyone knows where this was located?
(Photo credit: Alison Emery of Facebook Group “Nostalgic Singapore”)
Wow, great pix of A&W, looks familiar. If I’m not mistaken this outlet is along Dhoby Ghaut . the row of shophouses next to MacDonald House, towards Cathay cinema. As u can see Selegie Shopping Centre building in the background.
I Miss A&W…..
Remembered my parent brought me to Clementi outlet.
When KFC was known as Kentucky Fried Chicken, served with forks and knives, and had a slogan called “We do chicken right”
(Photo credit: Facebook group “if you were born in the 70’s in Singapore”)
Does anyone have a picture of KFC ‘s interior in the nineties ?
I can always fondly remember going to Jelita Caltex Mcdonald when I was a kid. Before Jelita Caltex was renovated, it was also a mini shopping mall within the petrol kiosk. Does anyone still have any photos of it?
Meanwhile in our neighbouring Malaysia…... In 2001, A&W Malaysia was bought over by KUB Malaysia Sdn Bhd and in 2008, embarked on an aggressive expansion drive to revamp and expand its reach.
However, this year, the company reported that they will close 34 A&W outlets (24 in Malaysia and 10 in Thailand) to reposition its business and operations to achieve sustainable growth. Any outlet that is not making money will be shut down or relocated
Yes, apparently this includes the iconic 24-hour A&W drive-in restaurant in Petaling Jaya.
Here’s a brief walk down memory lane for those of you who feel as nostalgic as we do about A&W:
– The company name was taken from the last name initials of partners, Roy Allenand and Frank Wright.
– The most famous A&W outlet is the first drive-in restaurant in Petaling Jaya, which opened in 1965 and quickly became a favourite gathering place for students, especially from the nearby Assunta and La Salle Secondary Schools.
– The unique A&W root beer mug was often “collected” by these young customers back then. “Collected” cough cough.
– It was THE filming location for Malaysian movies during the 70s and early 80s.
– Other than its signature draft rootbeer and rootbear float, A&W also serves typical fast food menu burgers, French fries as well as hot dogs.
I miss A&W. When I was in KL in 2010 and saw that A&W in PJ (pictured above), I was so excited and my Malaysian wife cannot understand why. Another thing I do miss after being away from Singapore for over a decade is the Hot & Spicy KFC, something that is unique to Singapore and Malaysia (I think). As a general rule, I do not eat fastfood when I visit Singapore these days, except Hot and Spicy KFC..
Wendy’s Singapore Closes Last Outlets, Pulls Out of Singapore Again
Fri, May 1, 2015
W.Today, I'm thinking.... clean the veggie boxes outside. Take Audrey for a bike ride and buy something yummy to barbecue for dinner tonight.
What are your plans?
Have you gotten a chance to meet Oscar yet?
The kids, Kip and I were invited to a special screening of Disneynature's Chimpanzee last week. We all fell in love with Oscar! A very special story about a little chimp, a beautiful mother and son relationship, the obstacles he has to overcome after loosing her and the lovely change of events that take place.
I'm still in awe from thinking about the tremendous amount of work for the film crew and photographers out in the wild!
If you are looking for something to do with the family this weekend, go see Chimpanzee. If you see the movie this week Disneynature will contribute $.20 per ticket sold to the Jane Goodall Institute and the Disneynature Tchimpounga Nature Reserve Project to help save chimpanzees.
Sending good thoughts to all of you for a beautiful Sunday!
<3 Marcela

Great RV parking New $7 Senior Menu Banquet Room Family Friendly Great Food Lil SambosTOKYO, Aug. 8, 2014 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Internet Initiative Japan Inc. ("IIJ") (Nasdaq:IIJI) (TSE:3774) today announced its consolidated financial results for the first three months of the fiscal year ending March 31, 2015 (1Q14, from April 1, 2014 to June 30, 2014).1
Overview of 1Q14 Financial Results and Business Outlook
"Under favorable business circumstances, we stay focused on actively investing our resources in services and solutions developments especially for cloud, mobile, BigData, M2M (Machine to Machine connection), SDN/NFV2 and overseas-related fields to significantly enhance our business scale in the middle to long term while bearing increasing costs at the moment. Among developments, we released several new products such as high-performance database services for BigData and cloud-based M2M platform in 1Q14. We've seen strong system investment demands supported by Japanese economic recovery and we believe the combination of our systems integration expertise and prominent services we develop should become an overwhelming differentiation against competitors in the long run," said Koichi Suzuki, Founder and CEO of IIJ.
"Our MVNO (Mobile Virtual Network Operator) services for consumers have been growing rapidly with our low-cost LTE SIM card offerings. We started offering voice call services, MNP (mobile number portability) option and unlocked SIM smartphones in 1Q14. LTE SIM services have been receiving much attention in the Japanese market and we anticipate a certain volume of price-sensitive mobile carriers' subscribers to switch within several years. Although our consumer service is growing, our main focus with MVNO business remains on enterprises. M2M and MVNE (Mobile Virtual Network Enabler) demands from blue-chips should continue to rise and become our important business growth drivers in near future by leveraging our large MVNO infrastructure and related services we develop on our own," followed Eijiro Katsu, COO and President of IIJ.
"We've continuously acquired advanced integrated transactions in 1Q14. Examples include one of the largest Japanese financial institutions' cloud adoptions for their online security controls and a major logistics provider's replacement of all of their internal systems to cloud. With regards to our overseas business, which is in start-up phase with deficit, we acquired container type datacenters construction transactions in Russia and Laos3 by leveraging our technology expertise. We also receive several requests to construct cloud infrastructure from some Asian countries. These kinds of business opportunities come from our continuous efforts to expand our overseas presence," continued Katsu.
"With regards to 1Q14 financial results, operating income decreased YoY while revenues increased. As we expected, fixed costs such as personnel-related costs increased with inviting 129 new graduates and the annual salary raise for existing employees and we had a one-time headquarter relocation-related cost, which will also incur in 2Q. On the other hand, our 1Q systems integration revenue tends to be the smallest due to seasonal factors in relation with Japanese corporates' budget system and recurring revenues should only increase gradually quarter by quarter. While we don't anticipate 1H14 financial results to be strong, we believe our business investment should enhance revenue accumulation in 2H14 and thereafter," concluded Katsu.

2 SDN/NFV: SDN is an abbreviation for Software Defined Network while NFV is an abbreviation for Network Functions Virtualization.

Cash and cash equivalents as of June 30, 2014 were JPY20,421 million compared to JPY10,276 million as of June 30, 2013.
Net cash provided by operating activities for 1Q14 was JPY2,855 million compared to net cash provided by operating activities of JPY1,528 million for 1Q13 mainly due to the decrease in payments of operating liabilities, while net income decreased from 1Q13.
Net cash used in investing activities for 1Q14 was JPY3,339 million compared to net cash used in investing activities of JPY2,340 million for 1Q13 mainly due to payments for purchase of property and equipment of JPY1,936 million (JPY1,719 million for 1Q13) and payments of guarantee deposits of JPY1,537 million (JPY661 million for 1Q13).
Net cash used in financing activities for 1Q14 was JPY1,509 million compared to net cash used in financing activities of JPY1,387 million for 1Q13, mainly due to principal payments under capital leases of JPY1,004 million (JPY981 million for 1Q13) and FY2013 year-end dividends payments of JPY505 million (JPY405 million for 1Q13).
Prospects for the Fiscal Year Ending March 31, 2015
Due to seasonal factors, our financial results tend to be weak in first quarter and strong in fourth quarter every fiscal year. 1Q14 revenue was almost in line with our initial expectation while operating income was slightly weaker than expected. Gross margin of systems integration was affected by extra work related to certain systems construction projects we completed last fiscal year.
Our FY2014 financial targets announced on May 15, 2014 remain unchanged although operating income of 1H14 may be a little bit weak. We had an increase in fixed type cost such as personnel-related at the beginning of a fiscal year, and we expect network services and system operation and maintenance revenues should accumulate quarter by quarter and system construction revenues should become large in 2H14.
Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Financial Measures
The following table summarizes the reconciliation of adjusted EBITDA to net income attributable to IIJ in our consolidated statements of income that are prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP.

Why It Doesn't Matter Whether You Like 'Community' -- or Tons of Other NBC Shows
The reason I've written in the past that NBC chairman Bob Greenblatt deserves to gloat about the network's dramatic rise to No. 1 from No. 4 is very simple: In this day and age, running a broadcast network is extremely difficult, and exactly how you climb out of the muck -- NFL games, riding a big singing show like The Voice, getting lucky here and there -- doesn't matter. You did it. And it was damned hard.
It also was written to be fair. Every network president eventually will stumble and be questioned or criticized. And these days Greenblatt must be looking at his assembled series and muttering the Tina Fey as Liz Lemon proclamation: "What the what?"
STORY: 'Community' Bosses Address Chevy Chase's Exit, Post-Dan Harmon Changes and Why Netflix Reigns
Because NBC has tumbled back down to earth -- or under it, depending how you look at it. The ratings are gone. New shows have flopped; Deception and Do No Harm were not only lousy dramas but spurned by viewers. Worse for Greenblatt -- because it's his pet show -- Tuesday's second-season return of Smash hit the earth like a wayward meteor, down 71 percent in the demo from its series premiere and 39 percent from its season one finale.
That's why the word "repudiate" is in the dictionary.
Hell, Do No Harm went below Rock Center numbers, which is really saying something. Even Go On, a modest hit that's basically Community in a more broadly palatable form, is bleeding viewers. One of NBC's biggest fall success stories was Revolution, but it doesn't return until March 25 and will have been off the air for nearly four months -- which, for a serialized show, is really testing viewer loyalty.
And now Community returns, the first episode from its new showrunners after Dan Harmon was relieved of his duties -- running the show he created. For a brilliant little series with a very small but loyal fan base, the switch at the helm and NBC's constant pushing back of the premiere has led to little flares of anxiety and exasperation on the Internet. The buildup of online chatter as Community returns Thursday night has been impressive for a cult show.
PHOTOS: 'Community' Season 4 Premiere First Look
Look, I happen to love Community. But it doesn't matter. It doesn't matter if you hate the new direction. It doesn't matter if you're pleasantly surprised that you can't really tell the difference. It doesn't even matter if you're just happy it's back.
Because it's dead. You must have known that. And if not, here's your reminder: Community is dead.
NBC has much, much bigger worries than Community, a series it essentially gave up on long ago. (If you want to see a similar pattern of network behavior, look into the ABC/Cougar Town archives and see how that ended.) No doubt the first thing Greenblatt is looking at with a certain panic are those Smash numbers. It's like the poster series for "hate watching" couldn't even generate that crowd to watch. Was Tuesday's premiere some weird aberration? If the numbers stay in nadir territory -- or worse -- Greenblatt will have his toughest decision as a broadcast network chief. On cable, where Greenblatt rose to prominence at Showtime, you can nurture the little ponies. At the network level, you're running horses. And if they don't win?
Bang! Glue.
This is the decision that will haunt and/or define Greenblatt. If Smash truly implodes, will he dump it and continue searching for a hit? Or will he take up a precious hour on the schedule for a show that can't be saved?
STORY: Why Even DVR Won't Save 'Smash' Ratings
See, NBC needs to overhaul its lineup. No tinkering. No patience. Before the upfronts in May, it's spring cleaning time in Burbank. Do No Harm and Deception will be gone, as will Community, the retiring-past-its-sell-by-date Office, the wretched Guys With Kids (one would hope). Already 30 Rock has had its swan song. Outside of The Voice and NFL games, what's truly untouchable on the NBC schedule? If you went from fourth to first and back to fourth again, you'd do some soul searching. And one would assume that soul searching would lead to, "We need to blow it up."
Personally, I love Parks and Recreation -- it's one of my favorite shows, and I hope it stays on forever. I also like 1600 Penn, Grimm and Parenthood. But those are not exactly hits, so there's worry.
Chicago Fire is not a show I'd watch regularly, but it does what it was designed for, and NBC needs to stay in the procedural game. Despite the star power in the sitcom Up All Night, the viewers never came, and NBC's decision to switch to a multicamera format with a live audience is a little bit like the crying doctor who keeps trying to resuscitate a patient who has flat-lined. Whitney and The New Normal? Betty White's Off Their Rockers? These are not keepers, people. These aren't shows that redirect a network skyward.
Dateline? The Celebrity Apprentice? The Biggest Loser? A little long in the tooth.
So, yes, enjoy Community tonight (or not). Pretend it's a wake. There's a reversal of course coming to NBC, and the only show to monitor for clues about how deep the cuts are going to be is Smash.

EXCLUSIVE VIDEO INTERVIEW: Tiger Woods Told Mistress He Loved HerGot the car keys, wallet .... baby. Oh, no! Where's the baby
Babies -- they don't always make noise when they need to.
Take the case of the baby found in the middle of the sidewalk in Winter Park.
The infant was in a stroller and apparently doing fine. But no parent was around for quite some time.
It turns out that the baby's dad drove away without him, Local 6 News reported.
Local News 6 employee Yolanda Vegas-Nelson was on her way to dinner when she discovered the baby. Sky 6 was overhead when a crowd started to gather around the stroller as the infant was found.
“How could you forget a baby in a stroller? It wasn't in a car seat. It was in a big, old stroller,” Vegas-Nelson said.
Within 20 minutes, Sky 6 captured the baby's father running up frantically to find police and emergency crews at the scene.
“He says, ‘I forgot the baby.’ He says he was three-quarters of the way home and he realized there was no noise in the back of the car and that is when he realized the baby was missing,” Vegas-Nelson said.
A passer-by gave him a hug as he broke down.
“He says, ‘I'm so sorry.’ He says, ‘My wife is at the spa,’ and he took them to Azalea Park and he honestly forgot the baby,” Vegas-Nelson said.
Police decided not to charge the father with child neglect and let him go home.
I wonder if he "forgot" to tell his wife about forgetting their baby...

I used to be an incredibly jealous person, and I think that is something that has simply disappeared with age! Managing jealousy in a relationship is something we are all going to have to do at some point or another. You may find yourself managing your own feelings, or handling the emotions of someone else.
1. Are You Being Reasonable?
One of the easiest ways of managing jealousy in a relationship is to stop and check if you are being reasonable. Think about what it is that is sparking your jealousy. Is it really worth being annoyed about? Try to do this alone while reflecting on the problem for a few hours. Once you have identified why you are not being reasonable (if that is the case), write it down and reflect on it when jealousy rears its gruesome head.
2. Check for Insecurities
It is often the case that jealousy stems from insecurities. I remember feeling jealous of a female friend of an ex. The main reason was that she was skinnier than me. Fortunately those woes rarely plague me now, but at the time they felt very real. If you can identify an insecurity, try to embrace yourself and reflect on your strong points. Don’t let feeling insecure drive your jealousy.
3. Let Go of The past
The past can seriously kill a relationship. I have been cheated on, so I understand the paranoia those experiences can bring! Many of us will find ourselves with a partner who has also been cheated on. When this happens, try to let go of the past together. Some people cheat, but another person’s bad behavior shouldn’t taint the experience you have right now.
4. Getting Or Giving Clarification
Sometimes a person’s behavior can seem odd, but that doesn’t mean they are cheating. If you are worried about the way your partner is behaving, talk to them about it. Similarly, if your partner is displaying signs of jealousy, ask them what has sparked the problem. Getting and giving clarification over a situation that is troubling you can prevent jealousy. In many cases, you guys can sit down and realize you were just being silly.
5. Trusting
Sometimes you may come across a situation where someone is clearly flirting with the person you love. Even worse, they may be actively hunting them down. First, recognize that you have someone awesome–someone else pursuing them is a compliment really! Next, realize that you only have to trust them. You can’t control the way other people act, so let go.
6. Spend Time Reconnecting
Sometimes jealousy begins when you have spent too much time apart. Working away, having to dedicate more time to studying, and starting a job that is demanding can cause jealousy. The person you love isn’t jealous of you, they’re jealous of the person who gets to spend time with you! If this is the problem, take some time to reconnect with the one you love. It can work wonders for your relationship, as it delivers instant reassurance.
7. Ditch Social Media
I have lost count of the number of times my friends have worried about jealousy stemming from social media. Guess what, you can live without it! If you both ditch social media, you are removing a major player in the causes of jealousy. Usually, Facebook is the root of these problems. There are simpler ways for you to stay in touch with others, and they won’t cause jealousy.
Jealousy is a real killjoy in relationships. It feels bad to experience it, and it often feels even worse to be on the receiving end of it. Fortunately, most of us can manage these problems. If you can’t, you may need to re-evaluate the relationship. If you have successfully managed jealousy in the past, how did it work for you?

Music Critic
Pasadena Star-News/San Gabriel Valley Tribune/Whittier Daily
News
A friend of mine who is a regular reader of my Blogs and
print articles was curious as to what I thought of the Los Angeles
Philharmonic’s season-opening concerts last weekend. He hadn’t attended the
concerts but asked because he had read several widely divergent reviews of the
program over the past few days.
Since I was busy performing, I didn’t attend any of the Phil
performances either, but my friend’s question (coming at the beginning of
another indoor concert season) prodded me to write a bit about what you read
when I and/or my fellow critics review a concert.
The first thing to know is that a review is one person’s
opinion. It’s not a poll of other people’s views.. Each reviewer — and, indeed,
each listener — brings to a performance his or her body of personal historical
and musical knowledge, as well as other psychological and even physical
elements (how you feel physically when you listen to music affects your
perception of the performance). Every person who attends a concert is a
“critic.” Even a phrase as simple as, “I liked it” or “I didn’t like it” is a
critical opinion, however superficial.
A second important thing to note is when the reviewer heard
the performance. Of the four reviews I read of last weekend’s concerts, Mark
Swed of the Los Angeles Times
attended Friday; Timothy Mangan of the Orange
County Register reviewed Saturday’s performance; Brian, who writes a Blog
entitled Out West Arts, attended on
Sunday; and CK Dexter Haven, who writes All
is Yar, was so enthralled that he he trekked to Walt Disney Concert Hall on
both Friday and Sunday. (If you haven’t read the reviews, they are linked to
the writers’ names above.)
Even for a group as top-notch as the L.A. Phil, differences
— sometimes substantial, sometimes subtle — show up in performances even a day apart,
so bear that in mind when you read reviews of different performances.
Moreover, there really is no pattern. Sometimes the
excitement of a first night produces an unparalleled performance; on other
occasions, concerts improve from one performance to another. CK Dexter Haven,
who, as noted above saw the Friday and Sunday concerts, wrote: “Friday’s
opening night concert was very good, but Sunday’s was noticeably better … In
fact, Sunday was the best concert I’ve ever heard Mr. Dudamel and the LA Phil have
together.”
A third point to bear in mind is the reviewer’s background
and experience. These aren’t always easy to find. Mark Swed’s BIO can be found
online at the Times (albeit with some
difficulty). Timothy Mangan’s BIO is on his Web site, Classical Life. Mine — a short version, I confess — is on my site,
as well — LINK. CK Dexter Haven’s bio information is HERE. Brian at Out West Arts (LINK) says even less, not
even his last name. You may not care about this information but it could affect
how you evaluate a review.
Throughout the course of a season, you occasionally get
widely divergent reviews; all critics have received their share of “Were you
and I at the same concert?” emails. That this divergence of opinion occurred in
this concert, where two of the pieces played — Ravel’s Pavane pour une infante dfunte and Stravinsky’s La Sacre du Printemps (The Rite of Spring)
— are pretty mainstream, made the spread of opinion interesting but certainly
not unprecedented (the middle work on the program was the world premiere of
Steven Stucky’s Symphony).
Digging a little deeper:
Each of the reviewers commented on the LAPO’s history with
The Rite of Spring; many of us
considered the work to be a signature piece of Dudamel’s predecessor, Esa-Pekka
Salonen and that note appeared in each review. Such information does count as
one difference between the casual concertgoer and the professional music
critic. Many critics have seen many performances of many works and are able to
remember and articulate the differences. That has its plusses and minuses for
you, the reader, but it’s worth bearing in mind. Moreover, reading each of the
reviews gives you a different perspective on this aspect and I, for one, find
that illuminating.
Everyone brings their own prejudices (i.e., likes and
dislikes) to any performance. When you read the concluding sentence of the
first paragraph of Brian’s post on the concert in question in Out West Arts, you certainly know where
he stands about Dudamel: “In fact, this weekend’s show, which I caught on Sunday,
may have been the worst single performance I’ve heard him and the orchestra
give together over his musically erratic, artistically lackluster tenure as
music director here in L.A.” You may agree or disagree with that sentiment but
it certainly colors his reviews about the Venezuelan maestro and, perhaps, your
reading of it.
By contrast, you usually get the reverse sentiment from a
Mark Swed review and from me because we believe that Dudamel’s leadership has
been galvanizing for the Phil. It doesn’t mean that Brian is totally incapable
of writing a positive review about a Dudamel concert or that Mark or I can’t
write a negative one. It’s just
part of the process and is worth keeping at least in the back of your mind as
you read.
In most cases, there’s more to a writer’s output than
reviews. For example, Brian in Out West
Arts has just posted one of his almost-always-interesting “10 Questions”
series — this one is about Andrew Norman, the new composer–in-residence of the
Los Angeles Chamber Orchestra. Even if you’re not going to the LACO concerts
this weekend (Saturday at 8 p.m. in Glendale’s Alex Theatre and Sunday at 7
p.m. in UCLA’s Royce Hall) where Norman will have one of his pieces performed,
this POST is worth your time.
So, why should you read reviews? I can think of three good
reasons. You may have others — if so, chime in by commenting:
1. Many critics and Bloggers — not all, I grant you — write
well. Moreover, we’re writing about a subject that we love, often with great
passion. The list of critics/writers/bloggers that I read runs into the many
dozens. Even if you don’t agree with everything (or, indeed, anything) a critic
has written (and I don’t), take the time to read, ponder and savor what he or
she has written.
2. You may learn something new. All four of the reviews
above had interesting pieces of information about the music, past performance
practices, and other elements. Both CK Dexter Haven and I like to add little
taglines to our reviews (he calls them “Random other thoughts” and I call them
“hemidemisemiquavers”) that we think are worth mentioning. Some you may know; others you may not.
They add to the spice of life in our musical universe.
3. You may, after reading someone else’s review, rethink
your feelings about a particular performance you attended. What I (and others)
wrote may reinforce what you felt or challenge your reactions. The late, great
music critic, Alan Rich, believed fervently that the job of a critic was to
write critically, in every sense of that word. The purpose of a critic, he
wrote in his book, So I’ ve Heard,,
is “not to lead his readers into blindly accepting his truths, but to stimulate
them, delight them, even irritate them into formulating truths which are
completely their own.” (Few people did that as well as Alan). Or can just savor
the review for its craft alone.
I’m going to review both the Pasadena Symphony concert
Saturday night (LINK) and the LACO concert Sunday night (LINK). I hope you find
my reviews worth your time whether or not you attended. As we move into a very
busy indoor season, I also hope you’ll attend as many performances as possible
and read not only about those performances but other classical music items as
well. That reading will become part of your overall enjoyment. And don’t be
afraid to comment; we all read what you write either in comments or via email —
the interplay is part of the fun.

Hp and torque are a constant relationship HP = TxRPM/5252
Thats why 1000 and 750 bikes with turbo or supercharger will put down very good hp numbers for there size as they rev higher
but remember peak torque and peak hp numbers are not quoted at the same rpm
and supercharged bikes will often keep raising the torque numbers beyond a turbo as the psi can be still rising , making a much more linear and easier to use power than a turbo with LOTS of midrange torque
As much as i like my turbochargers i am more than interested in superchargers and how they produce power
How much!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!??!

The city's early importance is evident from the fact that the Roskilde cathedral was the only cathedral in Zealand until the 20th century. At the Reformation in 1536, the Bishop's residence was moved to Copenhagen, and he from then on held the title of 'Bishop of Zealand'.
The cathedral, dating from the late Middle Ages, in the Gothic style, is the burial place for most Danish kings and queens. For this reason, several royal burial chapels have been added to the building, somewhat changing its appearance. (See Margaret I of Denmark.) The cathedral is a major tourist attraction. Another attraction is the museum that exposes the reconstruction of some viking ships of the 13th century.
Only in the 20th century, Roskilde became a university city; Roskilde University (Danish: Roskilde Universitetscenter) was founded in 1972.
Since 1971, a pop music festival is held annually in the vicinity of Roskilde, the Roskilde Festival[?]. It has grown to become one of the big pop festivals in Europe.Book Review/Giveaway: Ember the Dragon and the Birthday Surprise. Ends July 24th
Ember the Dragon and the Birthday Surprise by Author Kay Lynne Virgin
About the Book: Just how much trouble can a little dragon cause?
Join Ember the Dragon as he receives a surprise birthday visit from his three grandchildren Amber, Char, and Soot in this delightful tale of learning, love, and humor. Little Soot is very small and just learning his new dragon skills. In his first traveling excursion, things don’t go exactly as planned and problems arise as his new skills are put to the test and finds catastrophe waiting instead.
My Review: In the far away land of Forever After, lived a Dragon named Ember. It’s his birthday and he wasn’t sure how many birthdays he has celebrated. Was it 120…175…200? But he wasn’t worried because dragons live very long lives. As he sat outside his cave looking out to the field he wonder how it would be like to be tiny as he watch a hummingbird, for he wasn’t born small.
As he sat thinking his grandchildren were flying in to see him. Ember was overjoyed to see his grandchildren Amber, Char and Soot. Nothing was better than spending time with his grandchildren, for him it was a perfect present for his birthday.
Amber and Char flew in and landed perfectly hugging their grandfather as they waited for Soot who struggles with landing. As he flew in his landing was out of control and soon he came crashing to the ground and made a giant hole. Soot felt hopeless as a dragon and question why he’s so uncoordinated. Will he ever be able to do anything right?
Ember sat his grandchildren down and told them how as a young dragon he didn’t always do things right the first time. He told them how it took him a lot of tries before anything worked out correctly. Soot was encouraged by Ember’s story.
We know that persistence and practice always pays off. A very encouraging story for children and I highly recommend this book.

14 of this book is really cute. I’m certain my grandson will love it, just as he will love the story. While he’s enjoying it, he’ll be learning an important lesson. Like Soot, he may not do everything right the first time, but he needs to keep practicing and things will work out. I love books that teach kids a lesson without them knowing they are being taught!

My boys would love this book. My older boy would get something out of it in the fact the dragon tells its grandchild it is all right to notbe perfect the first time and to keep trying. My younger son just loves dragons and would love the story. julierupert@gmail.com
I also think that the themes of practice and persistence are extremely important for children today. It seems that so many either give up on something if they don’t do it perfectly the first time or they refuse to do it at all. This reminds me of the little engine that could! Keep trying and you will get it eventually. Plus, in this book the three young dragons help their grandfather dragon. This is a way to honor the elders of a family, another element that seems to be lacking in society today. Sounds like a wonderful book!
This is a book for grandchildren and grandparents to read together. I believe all children love dragon stories. Thank you for the opportunity to win.

What a neat story; my son loves dragons and I believe this story would be an amazing story to share with him. Cute dragons and good learning lessons = great!
The story has a really neat storyline. I find it super cute and the lesson too practice really does pay off in the end.
Ooooh…dragons! We’re big dragon fans here (Puff being the early introduction, and it stuck). This book sounds like fun.
My son loves reading about dragons. I would so love to read this with him!

I know my grandson’s will love this book. And the lesson that none of us are perfect and we shouldn’t give up but keep trying is a valuable one. I’d love to see the illustrations as well. Love the cover.

I agree with Ember – nothing is better than spending time with grandchildren!
I think this is a story they would all enjoy as a bedtime story because they each feel, from time to time, that they aren’t ‘good enough’ at something & can use some encouragement & guidance from us ‘old dragons’.

Ember sounds very nice and caring. It’s reassuring to know that no one is perfect and that practice pays off.If you thought Michael Lohan was done talking about what a mess his daughter Lindsay Lohan has become, think again. And this time he's getting her younger sister Ali involved too.
Michael is convinced that Lindsay is a horrible role model for her 15 year old sister Ali Lohan and that she's leading her down the same "destructive" path.
Michael told RadarOnline: “Lindsay’s leaning on Ali right now. Do you think that’s good? Leaning on your 15-year-old sister? Absolutely I think Ali’s following the same path!”
And Michael mostly blames Lindsay’s mother Dina Lohan for her personal problems.
He explained: .”
Michael Lohan may get a lot of heat from the media for being an attention seeker, but talking about Lindsay and her problems has worked. Lindsay is due in court later today for a progress report following her 2007 DUI.
Someone needs to intervene and get this girl cleaned up, and it's clear that it's not going to be Dina Lohan. Team Michael all the way.U.S. Army Staff Sgt. Paul Mazon and Staff Sgt.

Stall and his clients have yet to commit to nominating the two most accomplished 3-year-olds in a star-filled shed row, Departing and Sunbean, to the Triple Crown. The deadline to make a $6,000 late nomination is Saturday.
Both.
Stall declined to comment Monday on what his clients will do in terms of late nominating by Saturday, saying he simply intends to have the colts “on their game” for their next starts. There is an outside chance that Sunbean could be excluded from the Louisiana Derby if it overfills beyond the 14-horse maximum, but, “that’s something beyond our control, so we can’t worry about that right now,” Stall said.
The medication positives, both for small amounts of methacarbomol dating from races last fall at Churchill Downs, clearly are a source of major agitation for Stall. He said he is “frustrated beyond words” that there are reduced race-day threshold limits in effect in Kentucky for a Class C drug that is widely used as a therapeutic muscle relaxant under the trade name Robaxin.
Threshold limits for some medications were reduced to “zero tolerance” last fall amid sweeping statutory changes in Kentucky, with methacarbomol having a threshold limit of 1 ng/ml.
Stall.
In.
Cease “may have needed the race back,” Stall said, referring to a fifth-place finish for the 6-year-old gelding in a main-track allowance March 1. “He’s going back to the grass, and hopefully he’ll run like we know he can.”
Cease, with Brian Hernandez Jr. to ride, was assigned post 1 in the featured eighth, a $51,000 allowance with multiple conditions. The race is scheduled for “about” 1 1/16 miles on the turf and drew a field of 11, although not all will start because of main-track-only designations.
Tread,.
“I’m very happy they let the race go with just five [starters],” Stall said. “If the filly runs well here, maybe we’ll think about something bigger for her during Derby week at Churchill.”
First post for the nine-race Thursday card is 1 p.m. Central.

As a reward for the cadre of fans who have been waiting so long for Creeps to reach the DVD market, the director's-cut DVD is bursting at the seams with extras devoted to the film's creation and legacy. Two commentary tracks--one with Dekker, the other with Lively, Marshall, Atkins, and costar Jill Whitlow--provide insight into both the technical and the production sides of the film; the latter is particularly notable for the cast's first viewing of the movie's original, less-gimmicky (and preferable) ending, also included here. Dekker and the cast reunite for an impressive, four-part making-of featurette, which includes interviews with makeup creators David B. Miller, Howard Berger, and Robert Kurtzman and producer Charles Gordon. Atkins also gets his own spotlight extra, which profiles his long and prolific career both in and out of the horror genre; the disc is rounded out with seven deleted scenes, the original trailer, and a text-only trivia track that can be played along with the feature itself. --Paul Gaita

backtalk@Autumn Spice Cupcakes With Pumpkin-Spice Frosting
Total Time
Prep 20 mins
Cook 20 mins
This is an easy, festive recipe for autumn. I made this recipe with our nursing home residents in celebration of our October birthdays. They really enjoyed the aroma of the baking cupcakes and frosting them. We inserted pretzel sticks into the center of each orange-colored frosted cupcake to make them look like little pumpkins. What fun we had! This would also be a fun children's project. Enjoy! (Note: preparation time does not include time for cupcakes to cool.)
Ingredients Nutrition
Cake
- 1 (18 ounce) box spice cake mix (I use Duncan Hines)
- 1 cup water
- 1 (15 ounce) can pumpkin, pureed (I use Libby's Pumpkin Filling)
- 3 eggs
Frosting
- 4 tablespoons butter, melted
- 4 tablespoons pumpkin puree (I use Libby's Pumpkin Filling)
- 2 tablespoons milk
- 1 teaspoon vanilla extract
- 1⁄2 teaspoon ground cinnamon
- 1⁄4 teaspoon ground nutmeg
- 1⁄4 teaspoon ground cloves
- 3 -4 cups powdered sugar
- 1 teaspoon orange food coloring (optional)
Directions
- Cupcakes:.
- Preheat oven to 350°F
- Sift cake mix into a medium mixing bowl until all lumps are removed. Then add water, pumpkin and eggs and thoroughly combine with a hand-held mixer.
- Spoon batter into muffin pan cups lined with paper liners, filling each cup 1/3-full.
- Bake for 20-22 minutes or until a toothpick inserted into center of thickest cupcake comes out clean.
- Allow to cool on a wire rack for one hour.
- Frosting:.
- In a medium mixing bowl, combine butter, pumpkin, milk, vanilla, cinnamon, nutmeg and cloves.
- Add powdered sugar one cup at a time, blending with a hand-held mixer and scraping sides of bowl with a rubber spatula until a smooth and spreadable texture is met. (Note: You may use less or more powdered sugar per your preference. If frosting becomes too thick, thin with milk one drop at a time.).
- If desired, add food coloring for an extra festive orange color.
- Frost cooled cupcakes.

These were very good and full of flavor. I followed the recipe to a T and they turned out wonderful and were very easy to make. I thought the frosting was extra special since it had pumkin in it and my son liked the orange frosting!

This weekend DM and I will be dragging some noobs across to shoot prairie dogs and eat Farmmom's cooking, and I'll be tossing them out of the truck in the pasture with a bag of cake for my own amusement.

Congrats hopefully the corporate giant sells ammo that you get a discount on.
Good news!
I'm glad for you, that you have a steady source of income.
I'm also happy that you still enjoy hosting the prairie poodle gunnery. Y'all provided me many happy hours of such activity. And, just for the record, many of those non-contact shots weren't REEALY misses - - I was just training the pasture pups to be cautious, so there'd be some left for later hunters. ;)
Congrats! Hope you enjoy working for Evil Corporate Giant.
Good to hear about the job... I hope it works a lot better for you than that last one.

I haven't kept up with farm and ranch jargon since my granddad died. Forty years ago, I would have understood "cake" to mean pelletized alfalfa, and I can't figure out why that would be amusing.

I was in college when I first realized there's a big difference between delegating responsibility and relinquishing control. I was arranging a three-day outing for 1,500 students, and it was a bigger job than one person could pull off. So I recruited 30 classmates and gave each of them total freedom and control over particular activities. It worked like magic. On their initiative -- not mine -- we had computer models for transporting students, new campsites to accommodate more hikers, and some very creative menus.
After getting an M.B.A. and doing a stint on Wall Street, I became assistant general manager of a traditionally organized manufacturing company. When that company was growing, the management style wasn't so important. But when sales sloughed off, the traditional structure just didn't work. Rather than joining together to solve problems, people pointed fingers up and down the hierarchy. It was hard to tell who was responsible for mistakes and how to prevent those mistakes from happening again. It was also clear that employees were prevented from solving problems because they simply didn't have enough information.
So I became a believer in giving employees as much information and responsibility as possible. When I was hired as president of Merlin Metalworks Inc., I had a chance to try out my theories. There I discovered that theory can bump heads with practice when you're trying to manage a young, fast-growing, shorthanded company.
When I arrived at Merlin, in 1989, there were five people in the basement of an old mill building, using pre-World War II machines to produce bicycles from an alloy recently developed by the aerospace industry. Since then Merlin has grown 10-fold both in revenues and in employees, many of whom had been laid off by large corporations like GE and General Dynamics.
One day early on in my career there, two welders hovered outside my door, waiting for me to get off the phone. A welder's time is not cheap, but the person on the phone was a potential investor, and I didn't want to put him on hold. When I finally ended the conversation, I learned that one of the welders wanted to let me know that he had a dentist appointment the next week, and the other needed to leave early to pick up an anniversary present for his wife. They wanted to know if they should fill out some type of form to get approval for taking time off. The scene just didn't make sense. It was at that point I realized that employees are grown-ups who have things to do that I really don't want to take time out to think about, much less create, distribute, and file documents for. That was the moment flextime hit Merlin.
Despite my resolve to push power and information down the organization as far as possible, I found the learning curve pretty steep. One morning as I walked in, I glanced at the shipping log for the previous day and found, to my dismay, that nothing had been shipped. Zippo. I began asking around and learned that a customer had called about a problem bottom bracket -- the place where the pedals attach -- which made that customer's $4,000 bike useless. The customer-service department has the power to stop everything to solve an isolated problem for one customer. In this case, that meant turning off the final threading machine for a whole day, which brought shipments to a halt. Once people understood the blip they had caused in cash flow, they realized that we needed to adjust our service goals. An expensive lesson, but the mistake never happened again.
It's easy for a manager to get so caught up in the big picture that little details that affect employee morale can be ignored. That's especially damaging in a company that's working to involve employees in every aspect of the business. I learned about that one stressful week when the finishing department reached its most aggressive goal to date. Bikes were practically flying out the door. The finishers came by individually to tell me the department had made the goal. I was polite, but I was thinking, "Yeah, I already know about that." I was fixated at the time on a large wire transfer from one of our European distributors that was late. The next time the finishers made such an important benchmark, they ordered an ice-cream cake in celebration. No one saved me a piece.
At a company like Merlin, everybody has ideas about how to make things better. Once you've decided how you want to solve a given problem, it can be infuriating when someone questions your choice. For me, research-and-development decisions were the worst. I was forced to choose among options with very little data to go on. At one point we had decided to redesign the rear brake bridge on the road bikes. I was certain the new design would be cheaper, because it didn't involve welding and we could use a subcontractor during a period in which we were really busy. I gave the go-ahead to start production.
Then, shortly after the first order was placed, the person in charge of purchasing insisted on rehashing the decision. I agreed to go over it, although I don't think I was very successful at disguising my impatience. It turned out that the new design was going to lead to a series of new expenses, which added up to a lot more than a little extra welding time. I had to admit I'd been just plain wrong. That employee's persistence saved the company a lot of money.
Letting go often led to results that were different from what they might have been had I been involved. But so many things simply would not have happened at all had I not let go. One of the most satisfying things you can do as a manager is to point someone in a direction, give that person the resources he or she needs, let go, and watch him or her rise to the occasion. When we embarked on a short-term project to produce titanium racing wheelchairs, I needed someone to be in charge of the operation. I asked one of the machinists if she was up to the challenge. She was afraid she might fail and wondered what that would mean for her job. We agreed that if after a few months she felt as if she were banging her head against the wall, she could go back to her old job, and I would find someone else.
The results were astounding. There was, of course, some hair tearing (but it wasn't mine). In the end there were some 20 wheelchair racers from around the world in our titanium chairs, racking up results in all kinds of marathons and road races. And I had barely lifted a finger.
Under pressure, though, it's really easy to slip back toward a more traditional organization of work. We were preaching about teams, but in at least one case, we'd set things up in a way that forced employees to wait for commands and made it almost impossible for them to act on their own.
The problem was in the machining department. We were approaching a six-month backlog, and in a seasonal business, that can be suicidal. ("We realize it snows in Colorado in November, but is it OK if we deliver the bike you ordered last May on Halloween?") We kept increasing the size of the runs. (There are more than 35 operations in any given run of bikes, some of which proceed simultaneously, some of which must be linear, and a few of which are iterative.) The machinists would roll their eyes every time I added another 50 frames. "I know you made 200 57-centimeter road bikes last week, but this week we need 250 58-centimeter bikes." And then when we ran out of a critical size, I would ask the machinists to drop everything and make a minirun to accommodate an important customer. The machine coordinator became a drill sergeant. He had no choice.
He finally came to me and said we needed to make all the runs the same volume. "Right," I thought. "We'll just make all the customers ride the same size bike. So what if they can't reach the pedals." He explained that if the runs were small enough they could be completed faster, allowing us to do more runs a month. That way we could make only one small run of a size that sold in small quantities and two or three small runs of sizes that sold in larger quantities. If all the runs were the same size, similar operations would take the same amount of time, and the machinists would be able to keep up with the schedule and plan for themselves what to do next -- to work as a team. That new system eliminated both the need for panic-induced miniruns and the job of drill sergeant.
Finally, what manager hasn't had this experience: You're walking around the company and you come upon a group trying to solve a problem. And as you walk toward those people, you begin to feel some of the responsibility for solving the problem moving from their shoulders to yours. Sound familiar? Well, I now try to keep walking, leaving them with the responsibility until they call for help.
In the end relinquishing control can be full of surprises. But for employees and managers, the pluses unquestionably outweigh the minuses.* * *

Engagement, It’s The Secret Sauce
Social channels are not your “Field of Dreams.” Just because you build it doesn’t mean customers and fans are going to show up and start playing! You have to get them there and keep them engaged.
A phrase I like to use with clients is: “Telling is not selling, and selling is not engaging”. People don’t want to be sold to, they want to talk and be conversational.
Gary Vaynerchuk puts it in more animated terms by saying, “Everyone in social media marketing today is like a 19 year old dude: they try to close too fast”.
When it comes to engaging with your customer, or more general, your audience, there is one major rule: DON’T BE A 19 YEAR OLD DUDE!
Research is showing that most people in social networks don’t want to talk about your services, they just want to talk. We’ve long known that inserting funeral homes into social-media channels requires a conversational touch, but many are surprised by just how conversational. There’s increasing evidence that the most effective kinds of posts on these websites are simple, random, even silly statements: What are you doing this weekend? What is your ideal vacation? What’s your favorite movie or book? What is on your Bucket-List?
As a rule: two-thirds of a funeral home’s Facebook content should be conversational in nature. Conversational posts produce 8 to 12 times the response of more company-oriented ones. It’s not always about your firm. It’s about why people are there…to connect with other people, and (getting them) to connect with you because they like you. The numbers speak for themselves.
Though not industry related, the following numbers from the Oreo Facebook Page are staggering. Oreo is masterful in handling that balance between promotion and conversation. Consider the responses from several recent questions:
- “Ever try dunking an Oreo cookie with a fork or anything else?” Generated 8,200 “likes” and 2,300 comments
- “Pick a flavor, any flavor! If you could create a new Oreo cream flavor, what would it be?” Generated 7,100 “likes”, 12,500 comments
- “Pop quiz: Twist, lick, then…” Generated 6,500 “likes”, 6,200 comments
A single engaging post on a funeral home Facebook Page can reach 1000’s of people. If 98% of the posts are positive, the value is incredible.
What’s the value of all that to your firm? For the cost of $0.00 you have increased positive brand sentiment, generated a measurable earned-media value, and now have 100+ more people with whom you can share information. Not a bad ROI.
In the end it’s behavior-based – a Facebook fan has no value. Getting a Facebook fan to do something

Are Patents “Monopolies”?
JULY 13, 2009 by STEPHAN KINSELLA?
And see my comments (1, 2) on The Three Stages of Invention post, excerpted below:First, as to whether patents are monopoly grants–hell, even the feds admit this: “Section 154 and related provisions [e.g. Sec. 271] obviously are intended to grant a patentee a monopoly only over the United States market….” U.S. Supreme Court, Deepsouth Packing Co. v. Laitram Corp., 406 U.S. 518 (1972). See also: King Instr. v. Perego, by the Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit (“Congress made the policy choice that the “carrot” of an exclusive market for the patented goods would encourage patentees to commercialize the protected inventions so that the public would enjoy the benefits of the new technology during the patent term in exchange for granting a limited patent monopoly. In other words, the public expected benefits during “‘the embarrassment of an exclusive patent as Jefferson put it.’” Graham v. John Deere Co., 383 U.S. 1, 10-11 (1966).)
See also Engel Ind. v. Lockformer Co. (“We hold that the disputed royalties provisions do not inappropriately extend the patent monopoly to unpatented parts of the patented system”); Carborundum Co. v. Molten Metal Eq. Co. (.”)
And: Rice v. Santa Fe Elevator Corp., 331 U.S. 218, 230 (1947):.”
Brenner v. Manson, 383 U.S. 519 (1966):.
Diamond v. Chakrabarty, S.Ct. (1980), Brennan’s dissent:.
Now you can argue that patent holders do not necessarily have “monopoly power” (see The Importance of Patents for Economic Development – 1999, by Prof. William Hennessey), but as Rothbard et al. have pointed out, the government’s concept of monopoly is flawed; the only issue that matters is whether there is a legal monopoly granted. See, e.g., Hoppe, A Theory of Socialism and Capitalism, ch. 9, pp. 185-86:
The monopoly problem as a special problem of markets requiring state action to be resolved does not exist..
See also Rothbard, Man, Economy, and State (with Power and Market): “The only viable definition of monopoly is a grant of privilege from the government.”.
See also Arnold Plant,areas, while artificially restricting research in the nonpatentable areas.
Update: See “Ideas Need Protection: Abolishing Intellectual-property Patents Would Hurt Innovation: A Middle Ground Is Needed,” by William F. Shughart II, a senior fellow with the Independent Institute, The Baltimore Sun (Dec. 21, 2009):.
Update: It is interesting to note that one of the first patent statutes was England’s Statute of Monopolies of 1623.
Update: New York Law School professor Beth Noveck, quoted in an article on improving the U.S. patent system, admits: “A patent is a pretty significant monopoly, so we want to make sure we are giving it to the right people.”
Update: See my post IP Rights as Monopolistic Grants to Overcome the Public Goods Problem.
Update: As I note in Canada’s Founders Debated Justification for Patents, Canadian Sen. Jean-Charles Chapais, the agriculture minister, in introducing legislation for a Canadian patent law in 1869, readily admitted the monopoly nature of patents:
It must be remembered that a patent is a kind of monopoly, though he did not mean to say that the word monopoly should be taken in its fullest sense, but nevertheless it is a monopoly, because it gives to a man the right of manufacturing or vending alone, an article useful to the public; certainly there was great reason for granting this monopoly...
See also Alex Tabarrok, Launching the Innovation Renaissance (which I discuss here):
Innovators need time to recoup their sunk costs, but why should every useful, non-obvious and novel idea be granted a 20-year patent? Maximizing innovation requires treating different industries differently. The idea for one-click shopping does not have the same sunk costs of research and development as a new pharmaceutical, and the former does not need and should not be given the same monopoly rights as the latter. [Tabarrok, Alex (2011-11-21). Launching The Innovation Renaissance: A New Path to Bring Smart Ideas to Market Fast (Kindle Locations 241-243). TED Books. Kindle Edition.]
***
Update: “A patent is an obvious monopoly; the patentee has exclusive rights and, where patented processes are involved, conditions are necessarily monopolistic. This influence has many ramifications. Not merely does it directly protect the manufacturer of patented articles; it also permits the creation of a whole network of tying contracts, forced joint supply, resale price maintenance and other trade practices, not particularly conspicuous in themselves but cumulatively highly conducive to the consolidation of monopolistic conditions. Indeed it is so important an influence that it is no exaggeration to say that special lines of expertise exist, not to forward the progress of invention but merely to devise variations in productive processes permitting the continuation of this form of monopoly power.” ~ Lionel Robbins (1939)

Before BECKER, COWEN and ROSENN, Circuit Judges.finding.1, 68 S.Ct. 525, 542, 92 L.Ed. 746 , 105 S.Ct. 1504, 1511-12, 84 L.Ed.2d 518 .2, 68 S.Ct. at 542. The district court's findings are simply not clearly erroneous.3
Kikumura next contends that Cieplensky committed several fourth amendment violations even assuming the correctness of the district court's factfinding.
First, he asserts that the original stop was unjustified because interpreting New Jersey's careless driving statute so as to encompass Kikumura's driving would render the statute void for vagueness. We disagree. The statute prohibits "driv[ing] a vehicle on a highway carelessly, or without due caution and circumspection, in a manner so as to endanger, or be likely to endanger, a person or property." N.J.Stat.Ann. Sec., 102 S.Ct. 3348, 3359-61, 73 L.Ed.2d 1113 (1982), and we have no doubt that the statute encompasses his conduct.4, 88 S.Ct. 1868, 1883, 20 L.Ed.2d 889 , 88 S.Ct. at 1880., 88 S.Ct. at 1883, and can infer that a car containing a large hunting knife might also contain other dangerous weapons accessible to its occupants, see Michigan v. Long, 463 U.S. 1032, 1051, 103 S.Ct. 3469, 3481, 77 L.Ed.2d 1201 , 93 S.Ct. 2041, 2047, 36 L.Ed.2d 854 (1973), and, as such, is subject only to clearly erroneous review. See, e.g., United States v. Kelly, 708 F.2d 121, 126 (3d Cir.), cert. denied, 464 U.S. 916, 104 S.Ct. 279, 78 L.Ed.2d 258 , 93 S.Ct. at 2047., 104 S.Ct. 3138, 82 L.Ed.2d 317 (1984), was effected "by only one ... policem[a]n," occurred outdoors in "public view" and in broad daylight. It thus cannot plausibly be characterized as a " 'police dominated' " encounter, id. at 438-39, 104 S.Ct. at 3149,, 93 S.Ct. at 2047..5
III. THE SENTENCING ISSUES
A. Background
1. Procedural History
Kikumura was charged with twelve passport and weapons offenses, by far the most serious of which was violation of 18 U.S.C. Sec. 844(d), which prohibits transporting any explosive in interstate commerce "with the knowledge or intent that it will be used to kill, injure, or intimidate any individual or unlawfully to damage or destroy any building, vehicle, or real or personal property."6. Sec.. Sec. 844(d) was calculated under Sec. 2K1.6 of the guidelines and determined to be 18.7 Because Kikumura's other weapons offenses involved substantially the same harm as his Sec. 844(d) offense, and because his passport and visa offenses were all significantly less serious than his Sec. 844(d) offense, Kikumura's combined offense level was also determined to be 18.8 With no prior convictions, Kikumura was classified as having a criminal history category I, which resulted in a sentencing range of between 27 and 33 months.9 "enhanc[ing]:
[Tfinding,) Secs. 5K2.1 and 5K2.2); planned detonation of unusually dangerous explosives (see id. Sec. 5K2.6); intent to disrupt a governmental function (see id. Sec. 5K2.7); extreme conduct (see id. Sec. 5K2.8); endangerment of public health/safety and national security (see id. Sec. 5K2.14); and inadequacy of criminal history category (see id. Sec. 4A1.3). 706 F.Supp. at 340-42. In view of these factors, which it did not quantify, and the four purposes of sentencing set forth in 18 U.S.C. Sec. 3553(a)(2)(A)-(D), the court concluded that a sentence of 30 years' imprisonment was reasonable and imposed it. Id. at 346. Kikumura appealed. We have jurisdiction pursuant to 18 U.S.C. Sec. 3742(a)(3).
B. Guideline Departures--General Principles and the Applicable Standard of Proof
1. Introduction
The general framework for reviewing departures from the sentencing guidelines is by now settled. A district court must sentence within the applicable guideline range ).11 )12 ]; and (B) the reasons for the imposition of the particular sentence, as stated by the district court pursuant to the provisions of section 3553(c)13." 18 U.S.C. Sec. 3742(e)(3). This determination "involves at least two subissues: whether the factors relied on are appropriate; and whether the degree of departure was appropriate." Ryan, 866 F.2d at 610. At this stage of the inquiry, our review is deferential. See id.
Broadly speaking, Kikumura challenges the district court's decision to depart from the guidelines on three different grounds. First, he challenges as clearly erroneous the critical finding that he intended to use his bombs to kill people. Second, he contends that a departure predicated upon his offense conduct is legally prohibited, because the guidelines under which he was sentenced adequately considered his felonious intent. Third, he argues that even if some departure were permissible, the degree of departure in this case was unreasonable. We consider each of these contentions in turn.
2. Discussion
Perhaps like no case ever before reported, this one illustrates both the utility of, and the dangers in, real offense sentencing--a system that metes out punishment on the basis of a defendant's actual conduct in a particular case. Such a system recognizes that "particular crimes may be committed in different ways, which in the past have made, and still should make, an important difference in terms of the punishment imposed." Breyer, The Federal Sentencing Guidelines and the Key Compromises Upon Which They Rest, 17 Hofstra L.Rev. 1, 9 (1988). Because criminal statutes have never been (and probably never could be) written with sufficient particularity to take all such factors into account, a system of pure charge offense sentencing--one that metes out punishment solely on the basis of the offense of conviction--would necessarily abstract away considerations obviously relevant in determining an appropriate sentence. For example, it is self-evident that an internationally trained terrorist who is bent on murdering scores of innocent civilians should be sentenced far more severely than a duly licensed explosives merchant who knows that one of his customers intends to blow up an abandoned warehouse in order to commit insurance fraud, even if each of these defendants is convicted under 18 U.S.C. Sec. 844(d) for transporting explosives "with the knowledge or intent that [they] will be used to kill ... any individual or unlawfully to ... destroy any building."
The Sentencing Commission recognized the necessity of some measure of real offense sentencing during each stage of consideration of offense-related conduct.14 First, by writing offense guidelines in general descriptive terms, so that "some statutes may be covered by more than one guideline," Guidelines Sec. 1B1.1 application note 3, the Commission injected an element of real offense sentencing into even the initial determination of some defendants' base offense levels. Second, by modifying all base offense levels through a host of specific offense characteristics, see id. Sec. 1B1.1(b), and adjustments, see id. Sec. 1B1.1(c), (e), it incorporated several real offense factors into the determination of the final offense level of any particular defendant. Third, by designating only a few offense-related factors not otherwise mentioned in the guidelines as irrelevant for sentencing purposes, it consciously chose not to foreclose departure on the basis of most factors not expressly taken into consideration by the Guidelines' specific offense characteristics and adjustments. See id. Ch. 1, Pt. A, intro., 4(b); see also Breyer, supra, at 14.15. 1101. Sec. 3661 ("No limitation shall be placed on the information concerning the background, character, and conduct of a person convicted of an offense which a court of the United States may receive and consider for, --- U.S. ----, 110 S.Ct. 553, 107 L.Ed.2d 549 (1989).
This dichotomy reflects the judgment that a convicted criminal is entitled to less process than a presumptively innocent criminal defendant, see, e.g., McDowell, 888 F.2d at 290 (noting that the sentencing decision "is rarely ever as crucial as the initial decision finding guilt"), as well as the concern that "over-burdened trial courts would be greatly disserved by the time-consuming hearings" that more intensive procedural protections would require, United States v. Lee, 818 F.2d 1052, 1057 (2d Cir.), cert. denied, 484 U.S. 956, 108 S.Ct. 350, 98 L.Ed.2d 376 (1987); see also Breyer, supra, at 11 ("[T]he requirement of full blown trial-type post-trial procedures ... would threaten the manageability that the procedures of the criminal justice system were designed to safeguard."). Compare Mathews v. Eldridge, 424 U.S. 319, 334-35, 96 S.Ct. 893, 902-03, 47 L.Ed.2d 18 (1976), which held as a general matter that the degree of protection required by the due process clause depends, among other things, on balancing the nature of the private interest affected against the government's interest in avoiding the fiscal or administrative burdens entailed by heightened procedural requirements.
In run-of-the-mill sentencing cases, these principles are amply justified. For example, it would be unreasonable to suggest that the determination whether a convicted drug dealer willfully impeded the investigation of his offense, which would increase an applicable sentencing range of between 27 and 33 months to one between 33 and 41 months, see Guidelines Sec. 3C1.1, Ch. 5, Pt. A, must or should be made with the same degree of care as the prior determination whether an accused citizen may at all be stigmatized and punished as a convicted drug dealer.
Because less procedural protection is so clearly appropriate in the majority of sentencing cases, we sometimes tend to regard it as appropriate in all sentencing cases. However, legal rules--even rules that function perfectly well in familiar contexts when stated in categorical terms--cannot always be applied in extreme situations. Obviously, an appropriate level of procedural protection cannot be calibrated on a sliding-scale, case-by-case basis. For example, if proof by a mere preponderance is sufficient to justify a two-level increase for willfully impeding an investigation, see McDowell, 888 F.2d at 288, 290-91, then proof by that identical standard is also appropriate in order to justify, for example, a four-level increase for organizing an offense, see Guidelines Sec. 3B1.1(a); or a six-level increase for unlawfully receiving explosives that one knows to be stolen, see id. Sec. 2K1.3(b)(2); or probably even a ten-level increase for distributing those explosives to a fugitive from justice, see id. Sec. 2K1.3(b)(4). Here, however, we are dealing with findings that would increase Kikumura's sentence from about 30 months to 30 years--the equivalent of a 22-level increase in his offense level, see id. Ch. 5, Pt. A..
Analytically, there are two possible approaches for providing sufficient process in such situations. The first would place some limit on. Neither here nor in the district court, however, did Kikumura advance the argument that a conviction under 18 U.S.C. Sec. 844(d) is too slender a reed on which to support consideration at sentencing of the defendant's specific intent to commit murder. "[I]n the absence of special circumstances, such as a change in the law, we will not consider on appeal an issue that the parties failed to present to the district court." Flick v. Borg-Warner Corp., 892 F.2d 285, 387 (3d Cir.1989). No such special circumstances are present here.
A second, narrower approach to the problem would ratchet up certain, though not necessarily all, of the procedural protections afforded a defendant at sentencing, so as more closely to resemble those afforded at trial. Kikumura expressly advanced such an approach at his sentencing hearing when he argued that in order to support a departure predicated upon his intent to commit murder, the prosecution must establish that intent by clear and convincing evidence. The district court held that a mere preponderance was sufficient, see 706 F.Supp. at 345, but held alternatively that its findings were supported by clear and convincing evidence, see id. at 345 n. 28.
On appeal, neither party raised the standard of proof issue in terms. However, Kikumura has asked us to review findings of fact, an exercise that necessarily entails determining what standard of proof the factfinder should have applied in the first instance. See, e.g., Jackson v. Virginia, 443 U.S. 307, 318, 99 S.Ct. 2781, 2788, 61 L.Ed.2d 560 (1979) (holding that a habeas court reviewing the sufficiency of evidence underlying a criminal conviction must "determine whether the record evidence could reasonably support a finding of guilt beyond a reasonable doubt " (emphasis added)); cf. Anderson v. Liberty Lobby, Inc., 477 U.S. 242, 252, 106 S.Ct. 2505, 2512, 91 L.Ed.2d 202 (1986) ("[T]he inquiry involved in a ruling on a motion for summary judgment or for a directed verdict necessarily implicates the substantive evidentiary standard of proof that would apply at the trial on the merits.").
McMillan held that a preponderance standard was generally constitutional but suggested that a different question would be presented if the magnitude of a contemplated departure is sufficiently great that the sentencing hearing can fairly be characterized as "a tail which wags the dog of the substantive offense," 477 U.S. at 88, 106 S.Ct. at 2417. For the reasons explained above, we hold that in such situations, the factfinding underlying that departure must be established at least by clear and convincing evidence. Because Kikumura requested no higher standard of proof in his sentencing memorandum, we assume without deciding that the clear and convincing standard is sufficient in such cases. Our position is perfectly consistent with McDowell, which held that a preponderance standard is sufficient to justify adjustments provided for in Chapter 3 of the guidelines, see 888 F.2d at 291, none of which involves more than a four-level increase or decrease to a defendant's offense level.16
We recognize that there is overwhelming authority in our sister circuits for the proposition that guideline sentencing factors need only be proven by a preponderance of evidence, see, e.g., United States v. Wilson, 900 F.2d 1350, 1354 (9th Cir.1990); United States v. Frederick, 897 F.2d 490, 493 (10th Cir.1990); United States v. Guerra, 888 F.2d 247, 250-51 (2d Cir.1989), cert. denied, --- U.S. ----, 110 S.Ct. 1833, 108 L.Ed.2d 961 (1990); United States v. Ehret, 885 F.2d 441, 444 (8th Cir.1989), cert. denied, --- U.S. ----, 110 S.Ct. 879, 107 L.Ed.2d 962 (1990); (1st Cir.1989), but we note that in none of these cases did the operative facts involve anything remotely resembling a twelve-fold, 330-month departure from the median of an applicable guideline range. We hold that the clear and convincing standard is, under these circumstances, implicit in the statutory requirement that a sentencing court "find" certain considerations in order to justify a departure, 18 U.S.C. Sec. 3553(b), and we reserve judgment on the question whether it is also implicit in the due process clause itself.
C. Consideration of the Hearsay Statements of a Confidential Informant
In finding by clear and convincing evidence that Kikumura intended to kill people, the district court relied in part on the Hartman affidavit, which described the terroristic intent of the JRA generally and which linked Kikumura to the JRA specifically. The Hartman affidavit consists of hearsay (the declarations of a confidential informant) within hearsay (as related by Agent Hartman). Therefore, Kikumura contends, "[t]he Hartman affidavit should not have been admitted into evidence." Appellant's Br. at 10, 11 n. 3.17
In Baylin, we held that "as a matter of due process, factual matters may be considered as a basis for sentence only if they have some minimal indicium of reliability beyond mere allegation." 696 F.2d at 1040. In response to Kikumura's challenge, the district court faithfully applied Baylin and concluded that that standard was easily met. See 706 F.Supp. at 342-45. We agree. However, we believe that the Baylin standard, like the preponderance standard, is simply inadequate in situations as extreme and unusual as this one. Normally, hearsay statements may be considered at sentencing as long as they comply with the due process requirement set forth in Baylin. But here the district court's reliance upon the out-of-court declarations of a confidential informant was a factor in its decision to depart over ten-fold from the applicable guideline range. When the magnitude of the departure is so disproportionate, we believe that the sentencing court must ratchet up not only the standard of proof, but also the standard of admissibility.
At trial, the confrontation clause imposes a higher constitutional standard of admissibility than does Baylin at sentencing. Absent a firmly rooted evidence rule sanctioning its use, hearsay may be considered at trial only upon a showing of "particularized guarantees of trustworthiness," together with a showing that the out-of-court declarant is unavailable to testify.18 Roberts, 448 U.S. at 66, 100 S.Ct. at 2539. We are, however, reluctant to superimpose the jurisprudence of the confrontation clause upon the sentencing phase. As a textual matter, the sixth amendment, which refers to "criminal prosecutions," arguably applies only at trial. Further, as we discussed earlier, see supra at 1099-1100, the procedural protections afforded a convicted defendant at sentencing are traditionally less stringent than the protections afforded a presumptively innocent defendant at trial. Finally, if we held, as a general matter, that confrontation clause analysis is appropriate at sentencing as well as at trial, we would, in effect, render Baylin a nullity.19
Nonetheless, we believe that the Baylin standard is not sufficiently exacting to be applied in cases, such as this one, where the sentencing hearing can fairly be characterized as a "tail which wags the dog of the substantive offense," McMillan, 477 U.S. at 88, 106 S.Ct. at 2417. In such a situation, we think that due process requires more than a "minimal indicium of reliability," Baylin, 696 F.2d at 1040 (emphasis added).20 Instead, the court should examine the totality of the circumstances, including other corroborating evidence, and determine whether the hearsay declarations are reasonably trustworthy.21 Application of this heightened Baylin test is parallel to the requirement of clear and convincing evidence in the standard of proof context. At a garden variety sentencing hearing, Baylin and a preponderance standard apply; whereas, at trial, Roberts and a reasonable doubt standard apply. But, at a sentencing hearing where the court departs upwards dramatically from the applicable guideline range, intermediate standards should apply. Accordingly, factual findings must be supported by clear and convincing evidence,22 and hearsay statements cannot be considered unless other evidence indicates that they are reasonably trustworthy.
We are satisfied that the Hartman affidavit complies with our new intermediate standard as well as the more forgiving Baylin standard.23 The informant's testimony regarding Kikumura's presence and activities in the terrorist training camp in Lebanon is, in large degree, verified by numerous other details in the record: the presence of ammonium nitrate, aluminum powder, mercury fulminate, and flash bulbs in Kikumura's car; the fact that Kikumura was arrested for similar terrorist conduct in the Netherlands in 1986; the close parallels in conduct between Kikumura in the United States and Okudaira in Naples; the fact that Kikumura purchased the components for his bombs in several states in order to avoid detection; and, perhaps most significantly, the fact that Kikumura was obviously skilled and experienced at constructing potentially lethal, carefully disguised firebombs from materials that could be purchased with ease at a neighborhood hardware store. Kikumura points to nothing in the record that casts doubt upon the believability of the informant's testimony. We conclude that there is sufficient corroboration to establish that the informant's hearsay statements are reasonably trustworthy, and, therefore, the district court's consideration of the Hartman affidavit was proper.
D. Validity of the District Court's Factfinding
Kikumura contends that the district court clearly erred insofar as it found that he intended to use his bombs against people, as opposed to property. He argues that "the testimony of Thurman established only that the lead shot would be useful to enhance personal injury or to enhance property damage, depending upon the bomber's intent. But [one] could not infer which of these two goals a bomber intended by the fact that he used lead shot." Appellant's Br. at 15 (emphasis in original). Kikumura misapprehends the significance of Thurman's testimony. Three times--once on direct, once on redirect, and once in response to a question from the bench--Thurman stated unequivocally that he believed Kikumura's bombs, by virtue of their use of lead shot, were designed for use against people. See supra at 1096. Kikumura points out that Thurman also agreed that "one of the purposes for this shrapnel could have been to destroy property," but that concession does not undermine his unequivocal conclusion that the purpose of the lead shot in fact was to kill and injure people. Contrary to Kikumura's suggestion, the other evidence in the record is, to some extent, probative of Kikumura's intended use of the bombs, and we think that it only reinforces Thurman's opinion.
In crediting Thurman's uncontradicted testimony and concluding that Kikumura's use of lead shot indicates an intent to blow up people by clear and convincing evidence, the district court did not commit clear error.
E. Was an Offense-Related Departure Legally Permissible?
"In determining whether a circumstance was adequately taken into consideration [so as to preclude departure], the court shall consider only the sentencing guidelines, policy statements, and official commentary of the Sentencing Commission." 18 U.S.C. Sec. 3553(b). The offense guidelines that applied to Kikumura's various counts of conviction were Secs. 2K1.3, 2K1.6, 2K2.1, 2K2.2, 2L2.2, and 2L2.4. Kikumura does not contend that Secs. 2K1.3, 2L2.2, or 2L2.4 take into consideration the intent to kill people. He does argue, however, that Secs. 2K1.6, 2K2.1, and 2K2.2 take this intention into consideration.
Kikumura concedes that his prior arrest in the Netherlands would support an offender-related departure under Guidelines Sec. 4A1.3, which authorizes a departure "[i]f reliable information indicates that the criminal history category does not adequately reflect the seriousness of the defendant's past criminal conduct or the likelihood that the defendant will commit other crimes." Section 4A1.3 also provides that "[i]n considering a departure under this provision, the Commission intends that the court use, as a reference, the guideline range for a defendant with a higher or lower criminal history category, as applicable." Plainly, an offender-related departure under Sec. 4A1.3 could not by itself support the sentence imposed in this case. Even if Kikumura's past conduct in the Netherlands and Lebanon indicates that his criminal history is as serious as the criminal histories of most defendants classified as category VI, the highest category employed in the guidelines, that conclusion alone would support a departure only into a range of between 57 and 71 months, see Guidelines Ch. 5, Pt. A, a far cry from the 360-month sentence actually imposed. Accordingly, we must determine whether any offense-related departures are permitted.24
On the date of Kikumura's sentencing, Sec. 2K1.6 read as follows:
Sec. 2K1.6 Shipping, Transporting, or Receiving Explosives with Felonious Intent or Knowledge; Using or Carrying Explosives in Certain Crimes
(a) Base Offense Level (Apply the greater):
(1) 18; or
(2) If the defendant committed the offense with intent to commit another offense against a person or property, apply Sec. 2X1.1 (Attempt or Conspiracy) in respect to such other offense.25
Application of Sec. 2K1.6 was predicated upon Kikumura's conviction under 18 U.S.C. Sec. 844(d), which makes it unlawful to transport any explosive in interstate commerce "with the knowledge or intent that it will be used to kill, injure, or intimidate any individual or unlawfully to damage or destroy any building, vehicle, or other real or personal property." Kikumura's offense level of 18 was calculated by application of Sec. 2K1.6(a)(1).
Kikumura contends that "18 U.S.C. Sec. 844(d) has intent to destroy property or to kill or injure people as a material element of the offense." Appellant's Br. at 17 (emphasis in original); see also id. at 20 ("[T]he statute presumes that the 'average' Sec. 844(d) violator intends to unlawfully blow something up (including people)...."). Therefore, Kikumura reasons, the guideline to which that statute is referenced, Sec. 2K1.6, necessarily takes into account his specific intent to kill people.
Kikumura glosses over the import of the precise statutory language. The statute's usage of the passive voice--one must know or intend that one's explosives "will be used" to harm people or damage property--brings within its ambit two distinct classes of offenders: those who transport explosives themselves intending to harm people or damage property, and those who transport explosives with intent or knowledge that others will or might use them to harm people or damage property. We think that Sec. 2K1.6 distinguishes between these two classes of Sec. 844(d) violators and, not surprisingly, that it punishes the former more harshly than the latter. In our view, if "the defendant" himself intended to kill people, then under Sec. 2K1.6(a)(2), he may be sentenced as if he had been convicted of attempted murder, for which the base offense level is 20, see Guidelines Sec. 2A2.1.26 On the other hand, if a defendant transports explosives knowing that they "will be used" by someone else to kill people, but does not himself specifically intend to kill people, he may be sentenced only under Sec. 2K1.6(a)(1), which carries a base offense level of 18.
Contrary to Kikumura's argument, the " 'average' Sec. 844(d) violator" does not necessarily intend to blow up something or someone himself. See supra at 1099. In fact, the "average" Sec. 844(d) violator sentenced at level 18 under Sec. 2K1.6(a)(1) does not specifically intend to kill people himself, because the "average" Sec. 844(d) violator who does is sentenced at no less than level 20, pursuant to Sec. 2K1.6(a)(2). We therefore find no merit in Kikumura's argument that the Sentencing Commission took into account a defendant's specific intent to kill people when it fixed 18 as an appropriate offense level for those Sec. 844(d) violators to be sentenced under Sec. 2K1.6(a)(1).27
Kikumura also attempts to prove his point by contrasting Sec. 2K1.6 with Sec. 2K1.3, which provides a base offense level of only 6 for unlawfully transporting explosives. Kikumura is correct to the extent he contends that Sec. 2K1.6 metes out significantly higher punishment for transporting explosives illegally than does Sec. 2K1.3 precisely because Sec. 2K1.6 considers the transporter's felonious intent regarding the ultimate use of those explosives. The fact that Sec. 2K1.6, as a whole, adequately considers felonious intent is beside the point, however, for the issue before us is the far more precise question whether Sec. 2K1.6(a)(1) adequately considers a defendant's specific intent to kill people himself. For the reasons already stated, we conclude that it does not.
Finally, Kikumura contends that a departure in these circumstances is prohibited by United States v. Uca, 867 F.2d 783 (3d Cir.1989). We disagree. Uca involved two defendants convicted of attempting to procure, without a license, a large number of handguns for sale to overseas purchasers, in violation of 18 U.S.C. Secs. 922(a)(1)(A) and 922(a)(3). The defendants were sentenced under Guidelines Sec. 2K2.3. The district court departed upwards in part because it could not imagine any legitimate purpose for which the buyers would use the handguns. See 867 F.2d at 786. In language seized upon by Kikumura, we reversed, holding that "[t]he intended use of the guns is not a circumstance warranting upward departure." Id. at 790.
Obviously, since Uca addressed what the Commission did or did not adequately consider in writing Sec. 2K2.3, it does not control our determination of what the Commission did or did not consider in writing Sec. 2K1.6. This distinction aside, we still do not find Uca 's reasoning applicable to this case.
As discussed above, we think that, in most cases, there is a meaningful distinction between a defendant who intends to cause a harm himself and a defendant who acts with the knowledge or intent that someone else cause the same harm. Moreover, each of these two mental states can be further trifurcated according to whether the harm was specifically intended, knowingly caused, or consciously and unjustifiably risked. Compare, e.g., Model Penal Code Sec. 2.02(2)(a) (1985) ("Purposely") with id. Sec. 2.02(2)(b) ("Knowingly") with id. Sec. 2.02(2)(c) ("Recklessly"). Even though these various distinctions obviously blend into one another at the margins, we think it obvious that the most culpable of the six possible mental states (acting oneself with specific intent to cause a harm) is significantly more culpable than the least culpable (acting with reckless disregard for whether someone else will cause the same harm). We believe that this case involves the former, and that Uca involved only the latter.
In relevant part, Sec. 2K2.3, at the time Uca was decided, provided as follows:
Sec. 2K2.3 Prohibited Transactions in or Shipment of Firearms and Other Weapons
(a) Base Offense Level
(1) 12, if convicted under 26 U.S.C. Sec. 5861; or
(2) 6, otherwise.
....
(c) Cross Reference
(1) If the defendant provided the firearm to another for the purpose of committing another offense, or knowing that he planned to use it in committing another offense, apply Sec. 2X1.1 (Attempt or Conspiracy) in respect to such other offense, if the resulting offense level is higher.28
So far as appears in our opinion, the Uca defendants did not themselves intend to use any of the firearms to commit a crime. Moreover, they could not have specifically intended or known that their buyers would use the purchased firearms to commit any crime, for if they did, their offense level would have been calculated under Sec. 2K2.3(c)(1), not under Sec. 2K2.3(a)(2), as it was, see 867 F.2d at 785.
The district court in Uca cited no hard evidence that the defendants knew, at least in any particularized sense, that their buyers would commit crimes with the handguns. Rather, the court relied on a kind of res ipsa loquitur argument that handguns--especially handguns purchased from unlicensed distributors--are often used in connection with other criminal activity, together with the inference that the defendants must have been aware of this fact, but were indifferent to the "potential acts of violence" that their conduct would facilitate. See 867 F.2d at 786. The district court's reasoning on this score might have been sound, but it failed to distinguish defendants' conduct from that of most other defendants sentenced under old Sec. 2K2.3(a)(2) for selling firearms without a license. Accordingly, we reversed the district court's upward departure.
In sum, we do not find Uca on point, despite our imprecise language in that case about the irrelevance of a defendant's "unlawful purpose," 867 F.2d at 788, or of the "intended use" of unlawfully transported firearms, id. at 790. Uca involved an entirely different guideline and an entirely different mental state from those at issue here. Even in the context of the guideline it was construing, Uca plainly cannot, in light of the cross-reference to Sec. 2X1.1 contained in Sec. 2K2.3(c)(1), stand for the proposition that Sec. 2K2.3(a)(2) adequately considers a defendant's specific intent regarding the ultimate unlawful use of firearms, any more than Sec. 2K1.6(a)(1) can be read, in light of Sec. 2K1.6(a)(2), as adequately considering a defendant's specific intent to kill people.
Kikumura next contends that both of the firearms provisions applicable to him, Guidelines Secs. 2K2.1 and 2K2.2, adequately take into consideration his intent to kill people. At the time of Kikumura's sentencing, those sections punished, respectively, possession of firearms by certain prohibited persons and possession of firearms in violation of various regulatory provisions of the National Firearms Act, 26 U.S.C. Sec. 5801 et seq.29 In pertinent part, they provided:
Sec. 2K2.1 Receipt, Possession, or Transportation of Firearms and Other Weapons by Prohibited Persons
(a) Base Offense Level: 9
(b) Specific Offense Characteristics
....
(2) If the defendant obtained or possessed the firearm solely for sport or recreation, decrease by 4 levels.
(c) Cross Reference
(1) If the defendant used the firearm in committing or attempting another offense, apply the guideline in respect to such other offense, or Sec. 2X1.1 (Attempt or Conspiracy) if the resulting offense level is higher than that determined above.
Sec. 2K2.2 Receipt, Possession, or Transportation of Firearms and Other Weapons in Violation of National Firearm Act
(a) Base Offense Level: 12
(b) Specific Offense Characteristics
....
(3) If the defendant obtained or possessed the firearm solely for sport, recreation or collection, decrease by 6 levels.
(c) Cross Reference
(1) If the defendant used the firearm in committing or attempting another offense, apply the guideline for such other offense or Sec. 2X1.1 (Attempt or Conspiracy), if the resulting offense level is higher than that determined above.
For his one count of conviction under 18 U.S.C. Sec. 922(g)(5), Kikumura's offense level was determined to be 9, pursuant to Sec. 2K2.1(a). For each of his six counts of conviction under either 26 U.S.C. Sec. 5861(d) or (i), Kikumura's offense level was determined to be 12, pursuant to Sec. 2K2.2(a).
Strangely enough, Kikumura's argument in the context of Secs. 2K2.1 and 2K2.2 is less easily dismissed than his Sec. 2K1.6 argument, even though Sec. 2K1.6, as a general matter, punishes conduct more serious than the conduct punished under the firearms possession guidelines. As explained above, Kikumura's argument that Sec. 2K1.6(a)(1) adequately takes into consideration a defendant's specific intent to kill people can be rejected simply by examining the face of Sec. 2K1.6(a)(2). Here, however, the cross-references to Sec. 2X1.1 are not dispositive, because they become applicable only after at least an attempt (to commit murder), see Guidelines Secs. 2K2.1(c)(1) and 2K2.2(c)(1), not just upon the presence of mere intent (to commit murder), see id. Sec. 2K1.6(a)(2). Under well-settled principles of the law of attempts, Kikumura's conduct in this case amounted only to "mere preparation," not an attempt, despite the extraordinarily meticulous nature of that preparation and the strong degree of certainty regarding his ultimate intent. See, e.g., Model Penal Code Sec. 5.01 (1985).
Nonetheless, we believe that anomalous results would follow were the firearms possession guidelines construed so as to preclude consideration of an intent to commit murder as a permissible basis for departure whenever the cross-references to Sec. 2X1.1 are inapplicable. To see this, one need only contrast a hypothetical operation of the firearms possession guidelines with a hypothetical operation of the firearms transaction guideline, discussed above in connection with Uca. Imagine the following two situations:
1. D unlawfully possesses a gun and intends to use it to kill V himself. D begins to prepare for the murder, but is apprehended just before the preparation ripens into an attempt.
2. D lawfully possesses a gun, but gives it to T intending that T use it to kill V. T begins to prepare for the murder, but is apprehended just before the preparation ripens into an attempt.
We think it self-evident that defendant D in case 1 is at least as culpable as defendant D in case 2, if not more so. In case 2, D would be sentenced at no less than level 20, as if convicted for attempted murder, pursuant to Sec. 2K2.3(c)(1) of the old firearms transfer guideline. See Guidelines Sec. 2K2.3(c)(1) (cross-referencing attempt guideline); id. Sec. 2A2.1 (providing a base offense level of 20 for attempted murder). On Kikumura's reading of the firearms possession guidelines, however, because "[t]he guidelines begin with a presumption that illegally possessed weapons are intended for unlawful use against people, and that presumption is factored into the base offense level," Appellant's Br. at 17-18, in case 1, D could be sentenced at no greater than level 12 were his unlawful possession of the firearm within the ambit of Sec. 2K2.2, and at no greater than level 9 were his unlawful possession within the ambit of Sec. 2K2.1. Because the Sentencing Commission obviously intended for the guidelines to operate as a cohesive and integrated whole, we have a duty to construe them in pari materia. We highly doubt that the Commission intended such a strange result as this one, and it would take clear textual evidence in the guidelines to persuade us otherwise.
Kikumura contends that Secs. 2K2.1(b)(2) and 2K2.2(b)(3) provide that evidence. We disagree. As the application notes make clear, the Commission intended these provisions as downward adjustments for "intended lawful use." Guidelines Sec. 2K2.1 application note 1 (Oct. 1988 ed.); id. Sec. 2K2.2 application note 1. Thus, we agree with Kikumura to the extent he suggests that the base offense levels incorporate some presumption of intended unlawful use. That use, however, might be nothing more than an unauthorized resale at a profit, so as to trigger potential application of Sec. 2K2.3. Moreover, many typical intended unlawful uses of a firearm--for example, to commit a robbery--do not imply an altogether more grave intent to discharge the firearm at the victim of the robbery. We desire to avoid the anomalous result described above, and we are mindful of a general interpretive posture under which the Commission's silence regarding a particular circumstance should ordinarily be construed as an intent not to foreclose departure, see Guidelines Ch. 1, Pt. A, intro., 4(b). We therefore conclude that these various possible intended unlawful uses of a firearm are sufficiently different from the intended unlawful use of shooting and killing someone that the consideration of intended unlawful uses generally in the base offense levels in Secs. 2K2.1(a) and 2K2.2(a) does not preclude departure on the basis of an intent to commit murder. We reject Kikumura's argument accordingly.
We hold that none of the offense guidelines under which Kikumura was sentenced adequately takes into consideration Kikumura's intent to commit murder. Thus, we conclude that an upward departure was legally permissible under 18 U.S.C. Sec. 3553(b).30F. Was the Departure Reasonable?
1. Departure Methodology
Having determined that an upward departure was not prohibited by Sec. 3553(b), we must next decide whether the sentence imposed was in fact reasonable. See 18 U.S.C. Sec. 3742(e)(3).
We begin by considering "whether the factors relied on [by the district court] are appropriate" bases for departure. Ryan, 866 F.2d at 610. It is important to note that analytically this inquiry is distinct from the prior inquiry into whether departure based on the same factors is foreclosed by Sec. 3553(b). For example, the guidelines nowhere take into consideration the fact that a defendant has blue eyes, but obviously any departure predicated upon that consideration would be unreasonable. In this case, we have had no trouble concluding that a defendant's intent to commit murder, when not taken into consideration under any of the applicable guidelines, is an eminently reasonable basis for an upward departure.
We must now consider a more difficult question--"whether the degree of departure was reasonable." Ryan, 866 F.2d at 610. Congress's express statutory directive to the courts of appeals to affirm all departures that are not unreasonable, see 18 U.S.C. Sec. 3742(f)(3), makes clear that our scope of review is deferential. At this stage, the question is no longer whether the district court has substituted its judgment for that of the Sentencing Commission, but rather whether the court of appeals should substitute its judgment for that of the district court. As one court has cogently stated:
This [final].
United States v. Diaz-Villafane, 874 F.2d 43, 49-50 (1st Cir.), cert. denied, --- U.S. ----, 110 S.Ct. 177, 107 L.Ed.2d 133 (1989). For these reasons, we have held that when departures are not foreclosed by Sec. 3553(b), the district courts are entitled to "a substantial amount of discretion" in determining the extent of any departure. See Ryan, 866 F.2d at 610.
At the same time, however, we think it clear that there must be some objective standards to guide the determination of reasonableness. The substantial sentencing disparity against which the Sentencing Reform Act was a reaction resulted not because district judges are generally unreasonable, but because determining an appropriate sentence for a particular defendant is quintessentially the kind of inquiry about which reasonable people may differ. Reasonable people might also differ when determining the limits of reasonableness of a departure, but we must make that determination as a matter of law. Reviewing the degree of departure is especially difficult because there are no statutory or common law calipers to guide us. Under the old regime, sentencing discretion was essentially unreviewable. In contrast, under the aegis of the Sentencing Reform Act, we think it improper for us to measure the extent of a departure from the guidelines against only our hunches and instincts. Rather, we believe that fidelity to the policy undergirding the guidelines requires us at least to strive for some principled basis for reviewing the reasonableness of departures. As the Seventh Circuit suggested in United States v. Ferra, 900 F.2d 1057, 1062 (7th Cir.1990), "[u]nless there is discipline in determining the amount of departure, ... sentencing disparity will reappear."
A natural starting point for deriving such standards is the statutory provision governing appellate review of sentences, 18 U.S.C. Sec. 3742. It provides that in determining whether the amount of a departure was unreasonable, the court of appeals must consider: "(A) the factors to be considered [by the district court] in imposing a sentence, as set forth in [18 U.S.C. Sec. 3553(a) ]; and (B) the reasons for the imposition of the particular sentence, as stated by the district court pursuant to the provisions of section 3553(c)." Id. Sec. 3742(e)(3). Unfortunately, neither of these considerations provides much guidance. Subsection 3742(e)(3)(B) seems to say little more than that if a district court fails to state the specific findings on which its departure is based, the court of appeals should vacate and remand for clarification, rather than attempting to reason from the record evidence to the sentence imposed in the first instance.
Section 3553(a) provides a standard more verbose, but no more precise, than the reasonableness requirement. It directs the district court to impose a sentence "sufficient, but not greater than necessary, to comply with the purposes set forth in paragraph (2) of this subsection." Paragraph (2), in turn, lists four purposes of sentencing--namely,. Sec. 3553(a)(2). Put more succinctly, the statute requires the sentence imposed to be minimally sufficient to satisfy concerns of retribution, general deterrence, specific deterrence, and rehabilitation--the four major theories that undergird criminal law. The statute says nothing about how much of each factor the law requires, how to determine the amount of each factor a contemplated sentence in fact would provide, or how to weigh factors against one another in the frequent situations when different factors (for example, retribution and rehabilitation) tend to pull in opposing directions.
The Sec. 3553(a) criterion is so vague that even though the Sentencing Commission has publicly encouraged departures in cases where application of its concededly imperfect guidelines would result in an inappropriately high or low sentence, see Guidelines Ch. 1, Pt. A, intro., 4(b), courts have held in effect that a refusal to depart can never result in a sentence inconsistent with Sec. 3553(a). See, e.g., United States v. Colon, 884 F.2d 1550, 1553 (2d Cir.), cert. denied, --- U.S. ----, 110 S.Ct. 553, 107 L.Ed.2d 550 (1989); see also United States v. Denardi, 892 F.2d 269, 272 (3d Cir.1989) (endorsing Colon ). In short, we do not think that Sec. 3553(a), by itself, could possibly impose enough "discipline in determining the amount of departure," Ferra, 900 F.2d at 1062, to prevent unwarranted disparity from continuing to plague the large class of cases not controlled by Sec. 3553(b).
Recognizing the need for additional standards, the courts of appeals have recently begun to look to the guidelines themselves for guidance in determining the reasonableness of a departure. See, e.g., United States v. Landry, 903 F.2d 334, 340-41 (5th Cir.1990); United States v. Pearson, 900 F.2d 1357, 1362 (9th Cir.1990); Ferra, 900 F.2d at 1061-63; United States v. Kim, 896 F.2d 678, 684-85 (2d Cir.1990). Today, we endorse that general approach.
The guidelines themselves prescribe such an approach with respect to offender-related departures pursuant to Sec. 4A1.3. If a defendant's criminal history category seems an inadequate measure of "the seriousness of the defendant's past criminal conduct or the likelihood that the defendant will commit other crimes," Guidelines Sec. 4A1.3, the district court is authorized to depart. In this context, however, the power to depart is not the power to " 'throw away the guidelines,' " Ferra, 900 F.2d at 1061-62, in favor of any sentence that strikes the judge as reasonable. Rather, Sec. 4A1.3 provides that, "[i]n considering a departure under this provision, ... the court [should] use, as a reference, the guideline range for a defendant with a higher or lower criminal history category, as applicable." For example, if a category I offender has committed a level 18 offense, and if the actual seriousness of the defendant's criminal history is like those of most defendants classified as category III offenders, then the district court must impose a sentence of no higher than 41 months--the top of the range applicable to level 18 offenses committed by category III offenders. See Guidelines Sec. 4A1.3.31
A similar approach is required by statute when a district court imposes sentence for an offense with no applicable guideline. In that context, the court must have "due regard for the relationship of the sentence imposed to sentences prescribed by guidelines applicable to similar offenses and offenders." 18 U.S.C. Sec. 3553(b). For example, if a category I offender commits offense-related conduct most analogous to conduct that the guidelines classify as level 18, then the district court must impose a sentence of no higher than 33 months--the range applicable to level 18 offenses committed by category I offenders.
The principle employed in each of these contexts--that the appropriate length of a sentence should be determined from the sentencing table, even outside the context of straightforward applications of underlying offense and offender guidelines--extends naturally into the context of offense-related departures pursuant to Guidelines Sec. 5K2.0.32 For example, if the guidelines applicable to a category I offender indicate an offense level of 18, but fail to take into consideration certain aspects of his offense-related conduct, a departure is authorized. However, if the actual seriousness of the defendant's offense-related conduct is like that of conduct classified at level 20, then, we believe, the district court must impose a sentence of no higher than 41 months--the top of the range applicable to level 20 offenses committed by category I offenders.
In our view, analogy to the guidelines is also a useful and appropriate tool for determining what offense level a defendant's conduct most closely approximates. Often, a departure might be supported by aggravating conduct that itself would constitute a separate offense described under a different guideline. In such cases, the reasonableness of a departure may be evaluated by "treat[ing] the aggravating factor as a separate crime and ask[ing] how the defendant would be treated if convicted of it." Ferra, 900 F.2d at 1062. That exercise necessarily would involve application of the Guidelines' grouping rules, Guidelines Secs. 3D1.1 to .5, which ensure that as new offenses are considered, total punishment is increased, if at all, in decreasing marginal increments. In these cases, analogy to the guidelines is especially appropriate because ".
Sometimes, the aggravating circumstance not adequately taken into consideration will amount not to a separate crime, but to a special offense characteristic employed in offense guidelines other than those applied to the defendant.33 In such cases, the gravity attached to the characteristic in the other guidelines provides appropriate guidance as to what degree of departure would be reasonable. For example, several guidelines provide for a two-level increase in offense level if the defendant's conduct involved "more than minimal planning." See, e.g., Guidelines Secs. 2A2.1(b)(1), 2B1.1(b)(4), 2F1.1(b)(2). If, in a case involving guidelines that do not take more than minimal planning into account, a district court decided to depart upwards solely on the basis of a defendant's more than minimal planning, we think that a departure equivalent to increasing the defendant's offense level by more than two levels would be presumptively unreasonable.
Thus, in a case involving a level 18 offense committed by a category I offender, a more than minimal planning departure would be reasonable only if the sentence imposed did not exceed 41 months--the high end of the guideline range applicable to level 20 offenses committed by category I offenders. In order to justify a departure of a greater magnitude than that, the district court would have to explain why more than minimal planning should make a greater difference in the context before it than it makes under the various guidelines where it is deemed a specific offense characteristic, or else explain why the case involves aggravating factors other than a defendant's more than minimal planning. Cf. United States v. Shuman, 902 F.2d 873, 876-77 (11th Cir.1990) (holding that the degree of a departure based on conduct described as a specific offense characteristic in inapplicable guidelines was reasonable when the departure amounted to an increase in offense level no greater than that provided in the inapplicable guidelines).
We do not suggest that this approach for measuring the reasonableness of a departure can always be mechanically applied, in the way that the guidelines can be mechanically applied to determine the applicable sentencing range from which possible departures may be considered. We are dealing here with analogies to the guidelines, which are necessarily more open-textured than applications of the guidelines. Sometimes, the district court will want to depart on the basis of conduct best conceived of as a separate offense for which there is no applicable guideline. Other times, the relevant conduct will appear most like a specific offense characteristic or an adjustment that the guidelines nowhere employ. Still other times, competing analogies each will be plausible, or a series of factors will be present that cannot be neatly disentangled from one another and analyzed component by component. In short, "the reasonableness of a departure does not always depend on ... mathematical precision." Shuman, 902 F.2d at 877. However, by attempting to "link the extent of departure to the structure of the guidelines," Ferra, 900 F.2d at 1062, the courts can avoid the kind of standardless determinations of reasonableness that inevitably produce unwanted disparity.
There may be vehicles for making offense-related departures under Ch. 5, Pt. K of the guidelines (and for determining the reasonableness thereof) other than the kind of analogic reasoning outlined above. Acknowledging the wide variety of situations that may arise and the superior vantage point of the district courts, we do not rule out the development of other such vehicles. We also recognize that there may be cases where the guidelines will not afford useful analogies. Under the facts of this case, however, we know of and have been directed to no other means to assess the reasonableness of the district court's departures; hence, we apply analogic reasoning. In applying this methodology, the deference we owe to the district courts, see Ryan, 866 F.2d at 610, attaches to the details of its exercise--i.e., how to craft any particular analogy it might wish to employ, which in turn could affect, for example, the determination whether offense conduct classified under applicable guidelines at level 18 is better treated, pursuant to a departure, as the equivalent of level 19, or 20, or some other plausible level.
2. Application of the Methodology
We turn now to the application of this analysis to Kikumura. Initially, we note that the district court, without the benefit of the principles we announce today, measured the degree of its departure only against the standard of Sec. 3553(a). Ordinarily, we would simply vacate forthwith and remand for application of the analogic reasoning outlined above. We have examined the district court's opinion with care, however, and we are convinced beyond any doubt that the district court would impose as high a sentence as possible up to 30 years.34 If a reasonable analogy existed to support the sentence imposed, remand would be a pointless exercise.35 We therefore proceed to consider whether such analogy exists. In this inquiry, we feel bound to consider only those circumstances cited by the district court as warranting a departure. Cf. 18 U.S.C. Sec. 3553(c); id. Sec. 3742(e)(3)(B). Given the principles enunciated at length above, we also are bound to defer to the district court to the extent that its departure can be deemed reasonable. Because in the upper ranges of the guidelines, which are applicable here, the length of imprisonment is more significantly affected by the criminal history category, we will first consider the available criminal history departure.
a. Criminal history category
The district court made clear that an upward departure pursuant to Sec. 4A1.3 was appropriate in order to reflect the inadequacy of Kikumura's criminal history category. Section 4A1.3 provides that "[i]f reliable information indicates that the criminal history category does not adequately reflect the seriousness of the defendant's past criminal conduct or the likelihood that the defendant will commit other crimes," the court may depart from the applicable guideline range. Applying this section, the district court found that both Kikumura's 1986 arrest in the Netherlands and his terrorist training in Lebanon justified an upward departure. See 706 F.Supp. at 341.
Kikumura concedes that his actual criminal history could reasonably support an increase from category I to category IV, but he nonetheless contends that the district court, in departing upwards, improperly considered his activities in Lebanon. See Appellant's Br. at 24-25. Regarding Kikumura's conduct in Lebanon, the district court found that he provided training in the use of explosives to members of a group publicly committed to perpetrating acts of terrorism against Americans. This conduct, which was not considered in Kikumura's criminal history category, appears to satisfy both parts of Sec. 4A1.3. First, it might be evidence that Kikumura's criminal history does not adequately reflect the seriousness of his past criminal conduct.36 Second and more importantly, Kikumura's training in Lebanon surely indicates that his criminal history under-represents the likelihood that he will engage in other criminal conduct.37 In sum, the record reflects, by clear and convincing evidence, that Kikumura is a professional terrorist who is extremely likely to commit other equally serious crimes in the future.38 Indeed, it is hard to imagine a situation where recidivism is more likely. Based upon his activities in the Netherlands and Lebanon, we think it would be reasonable to analogize Kikumura to a category VI offender. We now turn to the available offense level departures.
b. Intent to kill people
The district court found that Kikumura intended to use his bombs to kill people. See 706 F.Supp. at 340. That finding, which is amply supported by the record, suggests analogy to the attempted murder guideline. It might be objected that acting upon an intent to commit murder involves conduct far more inchoate than actually completing an attempt to commit murder. The analogy to attempted murder is nonetheless reasonable because several of the explosives and firearms guidelines cross-reference a court to the attempted murder guideline based upon a defendant's intent to kill people. See Guidelines Secs. 2K1.4(c)(1), 2K1.6(a)(2), 2K2.3(c)(1). Attempted murder carries a base offense level of 20. See id. Sec. 2A2.1(a).
Kikumura, however, did not intend to kill just one person; he intended to kill "scores." 706 F.Supp. at 340. As Thurman testified, had Kikumura's bombs been detonated, they would have caused "numerous" casualties. Thus, in further developing its analogy, the district court reasonably might have considered multiple attempted murders, not just one. Through application of the grouping rules, attempting to kill six people, as opposed to one, would increase a defendant's offense level by five. See Guidelines Secs. 3D1.1 to .4.39 Although it is difficult to attach an exact number to the word "scores" on this record, we think it clear that a five-level increase would be justified. One who intends to set off a powerful, time-delayed bomb inside a room full of people, we think, can fairly be said to have intended to kill whoever is present when the bomb explodes.40 The district court's findings make out a compelling circumstantial case that Kikumura intended for his bombs to be detonated in some crowded area. It seems inconceivable to us that someone with Kikumura's background and training travelled to another continent and prepared as he did for over a month in order to commit an isolated act of purely symbolic violence. We think that the district court would be quite reasonable to assume that Kikumura intended to detonate his bombs when at least six people were present. As a result, the district court could reasonably have increased his offense level by five.
An argument could be made that because of the unusual circumstances in this case, and the possibility that scores of people would have been killed, the court could adjust upwards by more than five levels. However, we believe that to allow such an adjustment, in the absence of stronger identification of a target and given the obvious difficulty of accomplishing such a bombing without detection, would be to permit undue speculation. In any event, we do not find clear and convincing evidence on that score, and hence we conclude that the maximum allowable upward adjustment is five levels.
c. More than minimal planning
Using the specific offense characteristics in the attempted murder guideline as a starting point, the district court reasonably might have enhanced Kikumura's sentence on account of his extraordinarily detailed, extended, and meticulous preparation in assembling deadly bombs from unremarkable items purchased throughout the eastern United States. We recognize that the attempted murder guideline contains a more than minimal planning adjustment only in cases involving an actual assault, see id. Sec. 2A2.1(b)(1), thus indicating that the Commission thought more than minimal planning generally irrelevant in cases involving attempts without an actual assault, which were sentenced under the same guideline. Nonetheless, we think that Kikumura's extraordinarily meticulous planning makes this aspect of his conduct substantially more culpable than that of most defendants charged with attempted murder. We therefore conclude that the district court reasonably could have imposed a two-level increase on this ground. See id. Sec. 5K2.0 (authorizing departure if, "in light of unusual circumstances," a specific offense characteristic explicitly mentioned in the applicable guideline attaches an "inadequate" level to that characteristic).
d. Intent to disrupt a governmental function
The district court departed upwards in part because of Kikumura's intent to disrupt a governmental function. See 706 F.Supp. at 342; Guidelines Sec. 5K2.7. Kikumura challenges this departure on two grounds.
First, Kikumura argues that this section, which authorizes departure "[i]f the defendant's conduct resulted in a significant disruption of a governmental function" (emphasis added), is inapplicable because it extends only to completed conduct. In attempting to parse the language of this provision so finely, Kikumura misapprehends the nature of the factors enumerated as possible grounds for departure in chapter 5K2. The Commission spoke in terms of completed conduct because most offenses involve completed conduct, not attempts. But fitting a case within the literal language of a Sec. 5K2 provision is neither a necessary nor a sufficient condition for making an offense-related departure. It is unnecessary because the enumeration of factors in chapter 5K2 is not meant to be exhaustive. See Guidelines Sec. 5K2.0. It is not by itself sufficient because certain guidelines do take into consideration certain of the enumerated factors. See id. In short, the enumerated factors merely flag for the court "some of the factors that the Commission has not been able to fully take into account." Id. (emphasis added). Ultimately, the permissibility of the departure is determined under 18 U.S.C. Sec. 3553(b), not under the literal applicability of some factor listed in chapter 5K2.
Second, Kikumura argues that in any event, his planned terrorist bombing of an uncertain target does not constitute "disruption of a governmental function" within the meaning of the guidelines. We agree. The district court determined that Kikumura sought to disrupt governmental functions because he "intended to alter through illegal means American anti-terrorist policies." 706 F.Supp. at 342. In essence, the court equated intent to influence government decisionmaking with intent to disrupt governmental functions. Even though our standard of review is deferential, we believe that the district court's interpretation of Sec. 5K2.7 exceeds the bounds of reasonableness.
Despite our warning against overly literal interpretations of the factors listed in chapter 5K2, we think that Sec. 5K2.7 was meant to deal with a wholly different situation than was involved here. Section 5K2.7 talks in terms of "disruption" of or "interference" with a governmental "function." As we read this language, the Commission intended to punish more harshly criminal conduct that frustrates the normal, day-to-day operation of government. We do not think that such language is sufficiently elastic to encompass illegal conduct which is designed to change governmental policy. Rather than being overly technical, we believe that this interpretation of Sec. 5K2.7 is simply faithful to the Commission's intention.
The case law is in accord, being to the effect that Sec. 5K2.7 applies only to conduct that directly obstructs or impedes the normal operation of government, not to unlawful efforts to change government policy. See, e.g., United States v. Murillo, 902 F.2d 1169, 1174 (5th Cir.1990) (departure valid under Sec. 5K2.7 because defendant, who was convicted of immigration law violations, compromised "the integrity of the amnesty system"); United States v. Garcia, 900 F.2d 45, 48 (5th Cir.1990) (departure valid where defendant stole an inordinately large volume of mail); United States v. Burns, 893 F.2d 1343, 1347 (D.C.Cir.1990) (departure valid where defendant manipulated federal procurement mechanism in order to divert government resources); United States v. Clemente, 729 F.Supp. 165, 168 n. 2 (D.Mass.1990) (departure would have been valid where defendant was convicted of stealing police promotional exams and selling them to police officers).
We acknowledge that other guidelines list an intent to influence government action as a factor warranting an upward adjustment, see, e.g., Guidelines Sec. 2A4.1(b)(1) (kidnapping); id. Sec. 2Q1.4(b)(4) (tampering with public water). Further, as the Commission has expressly stated, the fact that a factor is listed as a specific offense characteristic in one guideline, but not in others, does not preclude consideration of that factor as a basis for departure from the other guidelines. See Guidelines Sec. 5K2.0. Notwithstanding these considerations, we believe that the Commission's inclusion of this factor in a few guidelines does not mean that it should be reflexively applied to all guidelines. More fundamentally, however, without clear guidance from the Commission, we are reluctant to interpret this portion of the kidnapping and public water guidelines expansively, because we think that the across-the-board application of this factor to all crimes may be problematic in first amendment terms.
According to the district court's factual findings, Kikumura planned to bomb a federal government building in New York City in order to dissuade United States policymakers from engaging in any future anti-terrorist strikes similar to the bombing of Libya. While the vehicle chosen by Kikumura to influence American policy would shock the sensibilities of even the most callous among us, in theory, the "intent to influence" aspect of his conduct is indistinguishable from the motivation underlying ordinary civil disobedience designed to change government policy. Although those who break the law for political reasons are not immune from punishment, it is not clear that they should be punished more severely just because their ultimate objective was to influence government policy. Moreover, to assign a stiffer penalty to conduct with a political component than would be applicable to the identical conduct without a political component is arguably tantamount to putting a price on political activism. This seems to us a matter that the Commission may wish to consider further, and absent clearer instructions from the Commission at this time, we decline to approve an upward departure based on intent to disrupt a governmental function.e. Extreme conduct and endangerment of public safety
The district court also departed upwards in part because of Kikumura's extreme conduct. See 706 F.Supp. at 341; Guidelines Sec. 5K2.8. Section 5K2.8 authorizes an upward departure to reflect the nature of the conduct "[i]f the defendant's conduct was unusually heinous, cruel, brutal, or degrading to the victim," which includes cases of "torture of a victim, gratuitous infliction of injury, or prolonging of pain or humiliation."41 In order to avoid double-counting, we must limit our focus only to whether Kikumura's intended conduct was unusually heinous within the universe of attempted murders, for the attempted murder guideline plainly accounts for the fact that attempted murder, by its very nature, involves heinous conduct. Cf. Guidelines Sec. 5K2.1 (authorizing departure if death results and explaining further that the "means by which life was taken" is relevant in determining the appropriate extent of such a departure).
We conclude that an extreme conduct departure would be justified on these facts. Kikumura's bombs would have operated by spraying shrapnel with tremendous force in every direction. Were they detonated in a crowded room, it is almost a statistical certainty that some people would be killed instantly, others would escape largely unharmed, and still others would sustain permanent injuries or die slowly from their wounds. Because of this last group, the district court reasonably could conclude that an extreme conduct departure from the attempted murder guideline would be appropriate.
Furthermore, Sec. 5K2.14 states that the court may increase a sentence above the guideline range "[i]f national security, public health, or safety was significantly endangered" by the defendant. The district court found that "Kikumura's terrorist plot presented a grave threat to public health and safety" and therefore departed upwards pursuant to this section. 706 F.Supp. at 341. We acknowledge that the extreme conduct and public safety grounds for departure may overlap. We nonetheless believe that these concepts are analytically distinct. On the one hand, the extreme conduct ground addresses the fact that if Kikumura had exploded his bombs, some of his victims would have suffered particularly painful injuries or deaths. On the other hand, the public safety consideration addresses the fact that if Kikumura had detonated his bombs in a dense metropolitan area such as Manhattan, he would have significantly endangered the safety and welfare of the general public. Cf. United States v. Chiarelli, 898 F.2d 373, 380-81 (3d Cir.1990) (upholding a Sec. 5K2.14 departure because defendants' attempted escape at high speed in a van significantly endangered the safety of local residents). This latter ground for departure takes into account that Kikumura's planned bombing of a New York City building was far more reckless, and hence more culpable, than a planned bombing of a building in a more isolated area would have been.
There is also a possibility of overlap between our departure for endangerment of public safety and our consideration of multiple attempted murders. Yet we are still convinced that the public safety ground for departure addresses a sufficiently distinct aspect of Kikumura's conduct to warrant an upward departure. Because estimating the number of Kikumura's potential victims is an inherently speculative endeavor, we concluded that Kikumura could not reasonably be viewed as having attempted to murder more than six people. See supra at 1115-16. Consistent with that determination, the public safety ground addresses the fact that if Kikumura had successfully detonated his bombs, he not only would have killed people, but also would have threatened the well-being of countless other innocent bystanders.
The guidelines offer no guidance as to how much of an extreme conduct or public safety departure is appropriate. However, the guideline adjustments set forth in Chapter Three each provide for an increase of between two and four levels. Considering all the circumstances, we think that the maximum allowable upward departure (i.e., the limit of "reasonableness") for extreme conduct and endangerment of public safety would be five levels. This would bring Kikumura's offense level to 32--that is, 20 (attempted murder) + 5 (multiple attempted murders) + 2 (more than minimal planning) + 5 (extreme conduct and endangerment of public safety).
There are several reasons why we are convinced that it would be unreasonable to depart upwards by more than five levels for extreme conduct and endangerment of public safety. First, at the upper end of the guidelines, where the offense level grid intersects with criminal history category VI, each incremental offense level carries with it an additional sentence of over two years.42 As a result, we do not take lightly the decision to tack on another offense level. Second, the extreme conduct and public safety departures are superimposed on an already very serious baseline--attempted murders.43 Any increase above five levels for extreme conduct and endangerment of public safety therefore might involve us in impermissible double-counting. Third, this is a situation where the offense is sufficiently inchoate that it does not even rise to the level of an attempt. To endorse a greater departure would thus require us to engage in the sort of unconstrained speculation that we are unwilling to do. Finally, we have already taken into account the fact that Kikumura is a professional terrorist, and by definition a probable recidivist, by countenancing the maximum upward criminal history departure allowed under the guidelines. In view of these facts, we cannot affirm as reasonable any upward departure beyond offense level 32.44
f. Summary
Although the actual guidelines applied to Kikumura indicate a level 18 offense committed by a category I offender, based on the facts articulated as departures bases, the district court could reasonably have analogized this case to one involving a level 32 offense committed by a category VI offender. For such an offender, the applicable guideline range is between 210 and 262 months. Under these circumstances, the district court's sentence of 360 months is unreasonable and must be set aside.
For all the foregoing reasons, we will vacate the judgment of sentence and remand this case to the district court with instructions to resentence Kikumura consistent with this opinion.
ROSENN, Circuit Judge, concurring.
I concur in the court's holding that a sentencing judge may not make extreme departures from the sentencing guidelines without abiding by standards of procedural fairness more stringent than those which usually apply in sentencing hearings.1 I also concur in the court's analysis under the guidelines and in the sentence imposed upon Kikumura. I write separately, however, to express my concern that the Government's manipulation of Kikumura's charge and sentencing illustrates the problem reported by many courts that the sentencing guidelines have replaced judicial discretion over sentencing with prosecutorial discretion. In so doing, it may have violated Kikumura's right to due process.
The labyrinthian course which the sentencing guidelines require courts to navigate in reaching their decisions might obscure one salient feature of Kikumura's prosecution and sentencing: Kikumura was not convicted of attempted murder and yet that is the crime upon which the court relied most heavily in sentencing him. The original indictment handed down by the grand jury charged Kikumura in count two with transporting explosives with the "intent that it will be used to kill, injure, and intimidate one or more individuals." Before trial, the Government deliberately deleted that phrase from the indictment, allowing Kikumura to stipulate to the facts and be convicted of the remaining charges, the most serious of which involved Kikumura's knowledge or intent that the bombs would be used to damage property.2 See United States v. Kikumura, 706 F.Supp. 331, 334 (D.N.J.1989). Thus, the court did not convict Kikumura of the intent to kill, injure, and intimidate one or more individuals, an offense of which Kikumura consistently protested he was innocent. The Government then proceeded at sentencing under guideline Sec. 2K1.6(a)(2) which permitted consideration of Kikumura's alleged intent to kill people with his bombs.
This strategy, of course, made the Government's burden of proving such felonious intent much lighter. For example, prior to the sentencing hearing, the Government was not compelled to furnish Kikumura with the evidence against him to assure an informed and able cross-examination, and at the hearing, the Government was not burdened by the Federal Rules of Evidence and the responsibility to prove each fact beyond a reasonable doubt.
The sentencing guidelines no doubt encouraged this strategy. The guidelines permit the sentencing court to consider relevant conduct not charged in the indictment, including evidence of the defendant's intent in committing the offense. See Guidelines Sec. 1B1.3(a)(4), eff. Oct. 1987.3 Indeed, this comports with the former practice of sentencing judges who traditionally have considered collateral information affecting the level of a defendant's culpability. However, because of the extreme departure involved here for the separate offense of attempted murder, it seems evident that the Government and the sentencing judge did not consider Kikumura's attempt to kill as collateral but primary. In such a case, Kikumura should have been charged and tried for that offense. Failure to do so should preclude the Government from relying upon the separate crime of attempted murder as the vehicle for the drastic enhancement of the defendant's sentence.
A number of courts and the recent Federal Courts Study Committee have noted that one unintended effect of the sentencing guidelines has been to replace traditional judicial discretion over sentencing with prosecutorial discretion. In its final report, the Study Committee noted that "we have been told that the rigidity of the guidelines is causing a massive, though unintended, transfer of discretion and authority from the court to the prosecutor. The prosecutor exercises this discretion outside the system." Report of the Federal Courts Study Committee, April 1990 at 138.
In its earlier tentative recommendations, the Committee aptly observed, "Instead of achieving the congressional purpose of limiting and regulating sentencing discretion, the guidelines have actually had the perverse effect of transferring discretion from the court to the prosecutor, who then exercises the discretion outside the system...." Federal Courts Study Committee Tentative Recommendations for Public Comment, December 22, 1989 at 62, cited in U.S. v. Holland, 729 F.Supp. 125, 133-32 (D.D.C.1990). See also U.S. v. Roberts, 726 F.Supp. 1359, 1363 (D.D.C.1989) ("the de facto transfer of much of the responsibility for sentencing from impartial judges to prosecutors has had the effect of disturbing the due process balance essential to the fairness of criminal litigation"); U.S. v. Boshell, 728 F.Supp. 632, 637 (E.D.Wash.1990) ("Congress has thus shifted discretion from persons who have demonstrated essential qualifications to the satisfaction of their peers, ... to persons who may be barely out of law school with scant life experience and whose common sense may be an unproven asset").
Such prosecutorial control, although not unconstitutional per se, if left unchecked by the courts could be applied in a manner which encroaches upon the constitutional rights of defendants. Indeed, district courts have already found such constitutional violations. See U.S. v. Roberts, 726 F.Supp. 1359, 1368 (D.D.C.1989). In Roberts the district judge found a due process violation where the prosecutor regularly transferred certain drug cases pending in D.C. Superior Court to federal court. The court noted,
Simply by selecting out some defendants from among the many in Superior Court for prosecution in this Court, the U.S. Attorney is able to ensure that these particular defendants will be sentenced to imprisonment for a minimum of five or ten years, while others, not so selected but otherwise similarly situated, will, upon conviction, be sentenced under the discretionary sentencing provisions available in Superior Court to a small fraction of that time.
Roberts, 726 F.Supp. at 1372.
I am concerned that the Government's tactic in obtaining Kikumura's long sentence comes into conflict with the Constitution. What the Government appears to have done is to deliberately collateralize at the charge and trial stage the most critical element for this sentencing, Kikumura's specific intent in transporting the explosives. A hypothetical prosecution may illustrate the perceived misconduct. Suppose the police apprehend a man who is driving recklessly with the intention to meet others in a robbery conspiracy. State officials only charge and convict the man with violating traffic ordinances, but at the man's sentencing hearing argue that the underlying motive for the man's speeding was participation in a robbery at another end of town. The sentencing judge finds the state's evidence convincing and sentences the defendant as if he had been convicted of conspiracy to commit a robbery. I believe that in a federal habeas corpus proceeding attacking the constitutionality of the conviction, we would conclude such conduct violated the man's right to have the most serious crime specifically charged and proven at a trial which included the full panoply of procedural protection. Here, the Government's analogous conduct in manipulating the charge and sentence of Kikumura is no less offensive simply because it has occurred within the shadow of the sentencing guidelines.
Because Kikumura himself did not raise these objections on appeal and the Government had no opportunity to respond, I concur rather than dissent. For this reason, I believe that we are precluded from reversing on the ground that the Government's conduct here infringed upon Kikumura's right to due process. However, I believe that if the Government had proceeded properly and introduced the evidence of Kikumura's intent to kill at trial, the record at trial probably would have justified his conviction of that charge and sentencing as determined by this court.
The district court's factfinding is set out in detail in United States v. Kikumura, 698 F.Supp. 546, 547-53 (D.N.J.1988)
Kikumura also attempts to create an inconsistency between Cieplensky's and Crowley's testimony on the question whether Kikumura had already been handcuffed when Cieplensky searched the trunk. There is none, however: Cieplensky testified that he had handcuffed Kikumura, and Crowley testified that he could not tell whether Kikumura had been handcuffed
Kikumura contends further that "physical evidence"--to wit, the failure of the FBI to find traces of gunpowder or lead shot in the passenger compartment of his car--casts doubt upon Cieplensky's account. Kikumura is incorrect. Cieplensky testified, and the district court found, that Kikumura had placed both the powder and the shot inside an open black flight bag, so that any loose shot or powder would most likely have spilled into the bag, not onto the floor
Cieplensky testified that he moved the bombs twice--first, from the car to the adjacent ground, and second, from there to a safer distance some 150 feet away. Kikumura argues that this conduct lends credence to his contention that the bombs were discovered in the trunk. We do not understand Kikumura's reasoning. Regardless of whether Cieplensky exercised bad judgment in moving the cylinders the second time, when he knew that they were bombs, we fail to see how that action suggests that in moving the cylinders the first time, Cieplensky would more likely have taken them from the trunk than from the passenger compartment.
Arguably, Kikumura did not drive carelessly on a "highway" and therefore did not violate Sec. 39:4-97. See State v. Young, 95 N.J.Super. 535, 231 A.2d 857 (1967) (defendant could not be convicted of careless driving where he operated his motor vehicle in a municipal metered parking lot). However, Kikumura's conduct would appear to violate N.J.Admin.Code tit. 19 Sec. 19:9-1.17 (1990), which prohibits careless driving on the New Jersey Turnpike. This regulation defines "New Jersey Turnpike" expansively to include, among other things, service areas. See id. Sec. 19:9-1.1. We decline, however, to resolve this issue because Kikumura did not object to the application of New Jersey's careless driving statute on this ground
Because of our disposition of the consent issue, we need not address the district court's alternative holding that the search of the passenger compartment was justified as a protective search under the principles set forth in Michigan v. Long, 463 U.S. 1032, 103 S.Ct. 3469, 77 L.Ed.2d 1201 (1983)
The other charges included one count of transporting explosives without a license, see 18 U.S.C. Sec. 842(a)(3)(A); one count of possessing a firearm as an illegal alien, see id. Sec. 922(g)(5); three counts of possessing unregistered firearms, see 26 U.S.C. Sec. 5861(d); three counts of possessing firearms without serial numbers, see id. Sec. 5861(i); and three counts charging passport and visa offenses, see 18 U.S.C. Secs. 1543, 1544, 1546(a)
Unless otherwise noted, all discussions of, and citations to, sentencing guidelines refer to the October 1988 Guidelines. It is these Guidelines, which remained in effect on the date of Kikumura's sentencing, that were applied to Kikumura. See 18 U.S.C. Sec. 3553(a)(4)
Multiple counts of conviction involving substantially the same harm are grouped together for purposes of determining a combined offense level. See Guidelines Sec. 3D1.2(b). For counts grouped pursuant to Sec. 3D1.2(b), the offense level assigned to the group is the highest offense level assigned to a particular count within that group. See id. Sec. 3D1.3(a). Kikumura's passport and visa offenses were grouped separately from his weapons offenses. However, because the offense level assigned to the passport group was more than eight levels below the offense level assigned to the weapons group, the passport group was disregarded in determining his combined offense level. See id. Sec. 3D1.4(c)
The district court concluded its factfinding in a similar vein:
Based on all of the above facts, there is no conclusion other than Kikumura is an international terrorist, who has trained members of and has been given training by the JRA, who quietly acquired the elements for and constructed three anti-personnel bombs with the intent of murdering scores and severely wounding scores more of the survivors of the blast in order to wage war on the enemy of the JRA--the United States.
The Introduction to the Federal Sentencing Guidelines Manual similarly states:.
Guidelines, Ch. 1, Pt. A, intro., 4(b).
Section 3553(c) requires a court to state the "specific reason" for its departure. It is designed in part to facilitate meaningful appellate review
Although the Commission recognized that the system which preceded the guidelines was a kind of real offense system and initially sought (in its earlier drafts of the guidelines) to develop something approximating a real offense system, it ultimately moved closer to a charge offense system with a number of "real" elements. See Guidelines Ch. 1, Pt. A, intro., 4(a)
Moreover, the Commission incorporated real elements into the Guidelines' treatment of offender-related characteristics. First, it calibrated a defendant's criminal history category primarily to the length of his prior sentences, as opposed to the statutes under which those sentences were imposed. Second, by expressly authorizing departures based on "prior similar adult criminal conduct not resulting in a conviction," Guidelines Sec. 4A1.3(c), it permitted offender-related departures based on real considerations as well
Moreover, McDowell "explicitly d[id] not address the burden of proof in cases where a sentencing adjustment constitutes more than a simple enhancement but a new and separate offense." 888 F.2d at 291
Although Kikumura downplayed his objection to the affidavit in his court of appeals brief, he focused on that issue both in the district court and at oral argument before us
There is no question that the anonymity of the informant must be preserved in this case. The district court found that, "because of the nature of the information provided, there is more than ample evidence to conclude the life of the informant would be at risk if he were produced." 706 F.Supp. at 342 n. 20
We therefore do not adopt the Eighth Circuit's approach in United States v. Fortier, 911 F.2d 100 (8th Cir.1990). Operating under the assumption that the confrontation clause applies to all sentencing hearings, the Fortier court utilized the Roberts test to review the district court's reliance upon a hearsay statement to increase a defendant's sentence. The new standard we set forth below satisfies the reliability concerns that undergird Fortier, while at the same time avoiding the doctrinal pitfalls that would accompany adoption of the Fortier rationale. We acknowledge, however, the disagreement between this opinion and Fortier. The resolution of the question posed in this footnote is vital to the administration of sentencing proceedings under the Sentencing Reform Act regime. We hope therefore that the Supreme Court in the near future will decide whether confrontation clause principles are applicable at sentencing hearings, particularly in light of the Court's recent decision in Idaho v. Wright, --- U.S. ----, 110 S.Ct. 3139, 111 L.Ed.2d 638 (1990), see infra note 21
Under general due process principles, the amount of process due increases along with the importance of the liberty or property interests at stake in the proceeding. See e.g., Eldridge, 424 U.S. at 334-35, 96 S.Ct. at 902-03. We note, incidentally, that even under Baylin, the affidavit of an unidentified informant might well be deemed sufficiently unreliable to be disregarded
This due process inquiry is analogous to that required by the fourth amendment when probable cause determinations are based on information from informants. See Illinois v. Gates, 462 U.S. 213, 238-39, 103 S.Ct. 2317, 2332-33, 76 L.Ed.2d 527 (1983) (magistrate must examine the totality of the circumstances and ascertain whether the informant's tip is sufficiently reliable)
It is also important to note that in assessing reliability of a hearsay statement, the sentencing court's inquiry is not limited to "circumstances that surround the making of the statement," Idaho v. Wright, --- U.S. ----, 110 S.Ct. 3139, 3149, 111 L.Ed.2d 638 (1990). The Supreme Court's decision in Wright involved an interpretation of the confrontation clause and is thus applicable only at trial. In contrast to Wright, at a "tail-which-wags-the-dog" sentencing hearing, the court is free, and indeed is required, to consider other evidence that substantiates the proffered hearsay statement.
As we noted above, Kikumura advocated no higher standard of proof in his sentencing memorandum. See supra at 1101. If, at some later date, we were to require a more demanding standard of proof, this would not affect the applicability of our new standard of admissibility for hearsay statements at sentencing
Whenever an appellate court creates a new test, it is normally preferable to remand the case so that the trial judge can apply the proper legal standard to the facts in the first instance. Here, however, the district court, in applying Baylin, made extensive factual findings, see 706 F.Supp. at 342-45, and concluded that "the statements of the informant contained in the Hartman affidavits are very reliable," id. at 344 (emphasis added). We think the court's strong language makes clear that it would find our new intermediate standard met as well
Offense-related departures may consider only conduct that is relevant to the offense of conviction, within the limitations set forth in Guidelines Sec. 1B1.3. See id. Sec. 5K2.0. Offender-related departures, by contrast, need not be predicated upon such relevant conduct, but must be guided by reference to the other criminal history categories. See id. Sec. 4A1.3
One court of appeals has held that some offense-related departures may be predicated upon conduct that falls outside the Sec. 1B1.3 definition of relevant conduct, and that offender-related departures may be predicated only upon prior conduct that is similar to the present offenses. See United States v. Kim, 896 F.2d 678, 683-84 (2d Cir.1990). In this case, Kikumura's conduct in Amsterdam and Lebanon is similar to his offense-related conduct, and all other asserted bases for departure plainly fall within the relevant conduct definition. Thus, we have no occasion to consider these aspects of Kim.
The guideline was amended on November 1, 1989, but that amendment merely replaced the words "(Attempt or Conspiracy)" with "(Attempt, Solicitation, or Conspiracy)", in order to reflect a simultaneous amendment to the title (and substance) of Sec. 2X1.1
Kikumura argues that the "offense" referred to in Sec. 2K1.6(a)(2) must be a federal offense and that an intent to commit murder therefore ordinarily will not trigger application of that subsection because there is no general federal murder statute. Kikumura is incorrect. Several of the explosives and firearms guidelines contain cross-references to Sec. 2X1.1 substantially similar to the one in Sec. 2K1.6(a)(2). For example, one of the firearms possession guidelines provides that "[i]f the defendant used the firearm in committing or attempting another offense, apply the guideline in respect to such other offense, or Sec. 2X1.1 (Attempt or Conspiracy) if the resulting offense level is higher than that determined above." Guidelines Sec. 2K2.1(c)(1). As the background commentary to Sec. 2K2.1 further explains: Sec. 2K2.1(c) deals with such cases.
Clearly, therefore, application of Sec. 2K2.1(c)(1) is not ordinarily precluded because there is no general federal robbery statute, and we can discern no conceivable distinction between a state robbery "offense" under Sec. 2K2.1(c)(1) and a state murder "offense" under Sec. 2K1.6(a)(2).
As our analysis suggests, we are somewhat puzzled by the government's failure to object in the district court to the probation officer's application of Sec. 2K1.6(a)(1). At the sentencing hearing, the government went to great lengths to establish that Kikumura himself "intended to kill and injure people." Appellee's Br. at 37. If he did, then he transported weapons in interstate commerce "with intent to commit another offense against a person"--namely murder--and he therefore should have been sentenced under Sec. 2K1.6(a)(2). On appeal, the government suggests for the first time that Sec. 2K1.6(a)(2) should have been applied to Kikumura. We think that this particular argument is waived, and we therefore feel constrained to analyze only the propriety of departing from the range prescribed by Sec. 2K1.6(a)(1), rather than the possible initial misapplication of that section
We also reject here two final arguments--one advanced by the government and the other by Kikumura--concerning the appropriateness of departure. First, on November 1, 1989, the following provision became effective:
Chapter 5, Part K, Subpart 2, is amended by inserting the following additional policy statement:
5K2.15 Terrorism (Policy Statement) If the defendant committed the offense in furtherance of a terroristic action, the court may increase the sentence above the authorized range.
The purpose of this amendment is to add a specific policy statement concerning consideration of an upward departure when the offense is committed for a terroristic purpose. This amendment does not make a substantive change. Such conduct is currently included in the broader policy statement at Sec. 5K2.9 (Criminal Purpose) and other policy statements. See United States v. Yu Kikumura, Crim. No. 88-166 [706 F.Supp. 331] (D.N.J. Feb. 9, 1989) (1989 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 1516). The effective date of this amendment is November 1, 1989.
Guidelines app. C, at C151 (Nov. 1989 ed.).
The government contends that this subsequently enacted amendment, as simply a clarification of previously existing departure provisions, supports an upward departure in this case. See United States v. Ofchinik, 877 F.2d 251, 257 n. 9 (3d Cir.1989). Kikumura responds that applying the amendment retroactively in the direct appeal of the case that inspired it would effectively permit the Sentencing Commission to decide individual cases or controversies, in derogation of the separation of powers. In considering the reasonableness of the sentence imposed, we do address, to some extent, the terroristic nature of Kikumura's intended crime. We do not rely, however, on new Sec. 5K2.15 in order to justify that sentence, for subsequent clarifications cannot be considered on appeals of the cases that produced them.
In addition, Kikumura briefly argues that the departure must be reversed under 18 U.S.C. Sec. 3553(c)(2) because the district court "articulated no justification for the upward departure" on the passport counts. Appellant's Br. at 25. This contention is frivolous. The district court stated its reasons for departing in admirable detail, focusing on Kikumura's intent to kill people. The statement reflected the district court's conclusion that none of the applicable guidelines--including the passport guidelines--adequately considered that factor. Thus, the statement of reasons is sufficient vis-a-vis the passport offenses unless the applicable passport guidelines did, in fact, take into consideration an intent to commit murder, which they obviously do not.
This exposition is elucidated by considering the guidelines' sentencing table, set forth in Ch. 5, Pt. A, as a visual aid:
Criminal History Category I II III . . . Offense Level . . . 18 2733 3037 3341 19 3037 3341 3746 20 3341 3746 4151 . . .
Section 5K2.0 provides, in part:."
This situation cannot occur with respect to the real conduct addressed in Chapter 3 of the guidelines because, unlike specific offense characteristics, Chapter 3 adjustments are considered regardless of which Chapter 2 offense guidelines are applied
See, e.g., 706 F.Supp. at 346 ("Kikumura [sought to] randomly select ... innocent people as victims of his diabolical scheme of indiscriminate death and suffering. His very presence is a danger to society."); id. ("To permit Kikumura to mingle among the citizens of this or any other society before lengthy debilitation in the most secure prison facility is to invite not only him, but indeed others, to effect mind numbing calamity.")
Cf. United States v. Bermingham, 855 F.2d 925, 934 (2d Cir.1988) ("[A] dispute as to which of two overlapping guideline ranges is applicable need not be resolved where the sentence imposed would have been the same under either guideline range.")
According to the government, Kikumura's terrorist training in Lebanon constituted "criminal conduct" under several federal statutes. See Appellee's Br. at 48 n. 28. Of the statutes that the government lists, we believe that 18 U.S.C. Sec. 2331 is the provision most on point. This statute, a part of the Omnibus Diplomatic Security and Antiterrorist Act of 1986, criminalizes foreign conspiracies to kill United States citizens. See id. Sec. 2331(b)
With respect to the likelihood of recidivism, the district court found: "Kikumura is dangerous. It is not only probable, it borders on certainty, that he will commit similar offenses in the future given the opportunity to do so." 706 F.Supp. at 346. This finding, measured against a clear and convincing standard, is not clearly erroneous
Kikumura argues that his activities in Lebanon cannot be considered part of his criminal history because these activities were not criminal. See Appellant's Br. at 24 n. 5. This argument overlooks the fact that in departing under Sec. 4A1.3, the court also can consider past conduct indicating that the defendant is likely to commit other crimes, whether or not the conduct is itself criminal
No attempted murder count would be grouped with any other. See Guidelines Sec. 3D1.2. The offense level for each group would simply be the offense level for the count that is that group's sole element. See id. Sec. 3D1.3. Since none of the attempted murders, under the reasoning outline below would be more than four offense levels below any other, each group would be assigned one unit towards calculating the combined offense level. See id. Sec. 3D1.4(a). Finally, the offense level applicable to the highest individual group (here level 26) would be increased by five levels since more than five units were present. See id. Sec. 3D1.4, which provides
Number of Units Increase in Offense Level 1 none 1 1/2 add 1 level 2 add 2 levels 3 add 3 levels 4 or 5 add 4 levels More than 5 add 5 levels
For example, we would think it unreasonable to posit that Okudaira intended to kill only the five people who actually died when his bombs exploded at the U.S.O. club in Naples, Italy, as opposed to the eighteen who were injured and any others who were also present, but lucky enough to escape injury
Kikumura argues that departure on this basis is impermissible because Sec. 5K2.8 extends only to completed conduct, but this contention is without merit. See supra at 1116
By contrast, at the lower end of the guidelines, each additional offense level carries with it an increase of only a few months
As indicated above, we have considered the absolute as well as the relative degree of upward departure. Our holding permits an upward departure from a range of 27 to 33 months to a range of 210 to 262 months (the outer limit being a sentence of imprisonment of almost 22 years). We think that is the limit of reasonableness under the circumstances summarized above at page 1119
The Sentencing Commission's commentary expressly authorizes the sentencing court to "determine the appropriate procedure in light of the nature of the dispute." Commentary to Guidelines Sec. 6A1.3, eff. Oct. 1987
At Kikumura's pro forma trial, the Government stated its intention to prove at sentencing that Kikumura intended to commit murder. Thus, the trial court was fully aware that this most serious charge was being "reserved" by the Government for the sentencing hearing. United States v. Kikumura, 706 F.Supp. 331, 334, n. 2 (D.N.J.1989)
The Commission has since deleted the specific reference to the defendant's intent from this section of the Guidelines and replaced it with "any other information specifically in the applicable guideline." Guidelines Sec. 1B1.3(a)(4), eff. Nov. 1, 1990. The Government, in this case, applied guideline 2K1.6(a)(2) which specifically permits consideration of the defendant's intent. The court sentenced the defendant on February 10, 1989In this file photo, residents move in to the Century Park dorms on the Southern Miss campus with the help of their friends and family.

Touching a ring that belonged to Aunt May, Rachel was able to receive psychic impressions of the abduction. Rachel could not identify who the assailant was. But she did reveal that when Aunt May answered the door, she thought the person at the door was a Jehovah's Witness coming to preach about the Bible. It is worth noting that Aunt May left the chain on the door (meaning that she had not planned to let the Jehovah's Witness in), but she opened the door, no doubt intending to politely decline his invitation to visit with her.

Via the Literary Saloon, interesting article in Prospect on how rigid rules of staging Beckett's plays are threatening to ossify them:
The result of this approach was evident in both the Gate’s Godot and Calder’s Endgame: scrupulously faithful productions, performed with passion and insight by committed casts, but dominated by imagery so familiar that all surprise was absent.
Perversely, it seems to me, familiarity has made these plays more inaccessible: their visual motifs are so well known beforehand that they are more easily dismissed. Godot is “the one where nothing happens”; Endgame is “the one with the old pair in the bins”; Happy Days is “the one about the woman buried in the sand.” Like conceptual art, the point becomes the idea, not engagement with the work.
That's a powerful point: what interest would Beckett's heirs have in promoting his plays as cliches? And why such worry? After everything that's been done to stage and manipulate other classic UK theatrical works, the likes of Wilde and Shakespeare haven't been perverted. In any event, leave it to the audience to decide what works and what doesn't.

Scott, it’s not Beckett’s intentions we’re talking about – it’s his *instructions*. And rather than ask if they should “followed”, ask how Beckett’s instructions be *respected*. Choice of words is central – and no-one was more sensitive to words than Beckett. I’d rather watch his “cliches” than have his work swamped by careless luvvies.
Also, the article is in Prospect Magazine – home of tepid, conversative dross since 1995.
And it’s precisely because of “everything that’s been done to stage and manipulate other classic. . .theatrical works” that Beckett insisted it be *his* vision that predominates stagings of his plays, not the goofy vision of some third-rate director with “ideas.” Thanks ought to be given to Beckett for sparing us from the “re-stagings” of those who are his intellectual and aesthetic inferiors to an infiniteScollops On A Bed Of Red Onions

Today the Gaslamp Quarter is a trendy area with shops, restaurants, and galleries, attracting locals and tourists. The area covers less than 20 blocks and runs approximately from Broadway to San Diego Bay. There are also a large number of upper end hotels that are popular with both tourists and business travelers due to its great location in the city. This area underwent restorations in the 1970s which eventually led to it being listed on the National Register of Historic Places.

Ultimately,.
.1541 Ultimate
The 1541 Ultimate is a project by the Dutch hobbyist VHDL developer Gideon Zweijtzer. This is a Commodore 64 compatible expansion port cartridge that carries an Action Replay and Final Cartridge III (whichever the user prefers). Its main feature is fully-compatible FPGA-based Commodore 1541 emulation that is fed from a built-in SD card slot with C64 compatible files (e.g., .d64 disk images or .prg single program files) and connects to the IEC port of the C64 using a separate cable.
The difference between this and other SD based and .d64 mounting cartridges like the MMC64, Super Snapshot 2007, or MMC Replay is that the 1541 floppy (including its processor, helper chips, mechanics, and even sound) is fully emulated, resulting in very good compatibility.
File selection and management is done via a third button on the cartridge that brings up a new menu on screen. The 1541 Ultimate also works in standalone mode without a C64, functioning just like a normal Commodore 1541 would. Disk selection of .d64s is then done via buttons on the cartridge; power is supplied via a mini USB connector. There is a "Plus Version" available with an extra 32 Megabytes of RAM (as REU and for future use). The basic version has just enough RAM for the advertised functions to work.
The cartridge is slightly larger than a standard C64 cartridge, making it too big for standard cases. It is shipped "bare" with two stands at the far side to give it at least some stability.
The first batch of 1541 Ultimates were shipped in early April 2008 to all customers that had paid for it in advance, financing the production run. A second production run is already scheduled. Orders are handled on a first-come-first-served basis.
Other hobbyist projects similar to the 1541 Ultimate are the 1541-III and SD2IEC. However, these do not provide full 1541 emulation so compatibility with fastloaders etc. is very limited.

The problem was that it was always on Easter weekend. The event was held in the town my parents live in so we quickly adapted and we did Easter at my folk’s home. Each year mom would fix a dish called, Ham Pie. Everyone loved it, and it soon became our traditional Easter meal. We still to this day have Ham Pie, salad, vegetables, deviled eggs, and made-from-scratch banana pudding. Below is the recipe for Ham Pie. We decorate the dining table with toys eggs filled with candy and surprises.
When you celebrate Easter as a family, gather your kids around and have fun coloring eggs. Read the story of Jesus’ resurrection. Talk about what Easter really means. And, be thankful – He Lives!
Do you have any Easter traditions?

Ham Pie Recipe
- 3 Tbs. onion
- 1/4 cup green pepper
- 1/4 cup shortening
- 2/3 cup flour
- 2 cups milk
- 1 can cream of chicken soup
- 1 Tbs. lemon juice
- 2 cups diced cooked ham
Cook onion and pepper in shortening in a 2 qt. pan until tender. Blend in flour, milk, and soup; stir until smooth. Cook over medium heat, stirring constantly. When thick, stir in ham and lemon juice. Pour thickened mixture into greased 9” x 13” baking dish and cover the mixture with uncooked cheese biscuits (see recipe below). Bake at 450 degrees for 15 to 20 minutes until biscuits are golden brown.
Cheese Biscuits
- 1 cup flour
- 2 1/2 Tbs. shortening
- 1 1/2 tsp. baking powder
- 3/4 cup grated parmesan cheese
- 1/2 tsp. salt
- 1/3 cup milk
Mix all ingredients into a formed ball of dough. Sprinkle flour on a clean counter-top to keep the biscuit dough from sticking to the counter. Roll dough on floured counter-top to 1/4 inch thick. Cut with round 2” diameter biscuit cutter. This will make approximately 24 biscuits.The subject of religion has long been nettlesome for President Obama, but perhaps never as nettlesome as it was when … Continued

Great hospitality, professional team, strategic location.Researchers at Penn State University have found some significant advantages to heat-treating colostrum prior to feeding.
Standard plate counts for bacteria were cut nearly in half by heating the colostrum to 140 degrees F prior to freezing, storing and thawing it for the calves. Coliform counts were reduced to zero in the heat-treated colostrum.
Meanwhile, calves that received heat-treated colostrum had higher levels of protective immunoglobin (IgG) in their blood than calves receiving unheated colostrum. For example, the total serum IgG concentration of calves receiving heat-treated colostrum was 19 grams per liter at 12 hours of age, compared to 15.8 g/L for calves receiving unheated colostrum. At one week of age, the advantage was 24 g/L compared to 20.4 g/L.
Batch-heat treatment of high-quality colostrum at 140 degrees F for 30 minutes reduced bacteria concentrations and preserved IgG concentration and viscosity, the researchers conclude in this month’s edition of Journal of Dairy Science.PUBLIC RECORD

22 Fed. R. Evid. Serv. 247
UNITED STATES of America, Plaintiff-Appellee,
v.
Jorge MENDEZ-ORTIZ, Defendant-Appellant.
No. 85-3975.
United States Court of Appeals,
Sixth Circuit.
Argued Nov. 7, 1986.
Dec. 4, 1986.
Certiorari Denied March 9, 1987.
See 107 S.Ct. 1384.
Mark B. Weisser, argued, Martin Young & Assoc., Cincinnati, Ohio, for defendant-appellant.
Kathleen M. Brinkman, Cincinnati, Ohio, for plaintiff-appellee.
Before KENNEDY and MILBURN, Circuit Judges, and BROWN, Senior Circuit Judge.
PER CURIAM.
MILBURN, Circuit Judge.
Defendant-appellant Jorge Mendez-Ortiz was convicted of conspiracy "to possess with intent to distribute quantities of heroin" in violation of 21 U.S.C. § 846. On appeal defendant argues that the district court committed reversible error by admitting testimony from a government witness which indicated that defendant had threatened and attempted to bribe the witness and by refusing to instruct the jury on the defense of indirect entrapment. Finding no merit in these arguments, we affirm.
I.
In late 1984, Special Agent Richard Stuart of the Drug Enforcement Administration ("DEA") and Special Agent Steve Barnett of the Federal Bureau of Investigation ("FBI") commenced an undercover operation in Cincinnati, Ohio, which resulted in two undercover purchases of heroin from Larry Tapager. In March 1985, Agent Stuart again contacted Tapager, who was living with Gary Blair and Autumn Strange near Seattle, Washington. Through a series of telephone conversations with Tapager and Blair, Agent Stuart made two undercover purchases of heroin from them by mail.
On May 9, 1985, Agents Stuart and Barnett arrested Tapager in Seattle. After a series of telephone conversations between Agent Stuart and Blair and a dinner attended by Blair, Strange and the agents, Blair agreed to supply heroin to the agents. At approximately 12:10 p.m., Blair told Agent Stuart by telephone that he would contact his supplier and get the heroin. Immediately thereafter, four calls were made from Blair's telephone to 955-7582. When Agent Stuart called back to learn whether Blair had arranged delivery of the heroin, Blair said he had not reached his source. After Agent Stuart completed his call to Blair, another call was placed from Blair's telephone to 955-7582.
Telephone records of a residence in North Bend, Washington, show calls at 1:33 p.m. and 1:36 p.m. to Blair's telephone. At 1:41 p.m. Blair telephoned Agent Stuart and said that all was set and that he would meet him in an hour and ten minutes. At 2:55 p.m., defendant and Blair were seen by the agents meeting at a gas station in Bellevue, Washington. After Blair left, the agents arrested defendant. At 3:07 p.m., Blair called Agent Stuart and said that he was ready to do the deal. Later, Blair was arrested.
When the agents arrested defendant, no heroin was found on his person, but a small vial of heroin was found in the car which he was driving. The agents also seized a pager with the number 955-7582 from the front seat of the car. The pager's digital display showed 486-5806, the number at Blair's residence.
The agents located the residence in North Bend, Washington, which Blair had called before he told DEA Agent Stuart the heroin delivery was set to go. The North Bend residence was a rental property, and the property's owner identified defendant as one of the two men who rented the residence from him. Telephone records for Blair's telephone for January 29, 1985, to May 9, 1985, reflect a pattern: on numerous occasions there are one or more calls from Blair's number to the pager whose number was 955-7582, followed eventually by a call from the North Bend residence to Blair's number. The telephone at the North Bend residence was subscribed in a name which was a combination of the name of defendant's wife and the last name of defendant's cousin.
At defendant's trial, Blair testified that defendant was the source of the heroin which Blair and Tapager sent by mail to the agents in Cincinnati and that defendant had agreed to bring fourteen to nineteen grams of heroin when he met with Blair in Bellevue, Washington. Blair also testified that defendant told him that another person was holding the heroin and watching the meeting between them (Blair and defendant), that defendant agreed to deliver the heroin only after he (Blair) met with his buyers and signaled defendant that it was safe to make the heroin delivery, and that defendant had been his only source of heroin for six to nine months prior to their arrest.
Blair further testified that he and defendant had been arrested at about the same time, that he and defendant were locked up together, and that defendant blamed him for his arrest and told him basically, "Don't mess with us." Finally, Blair testified that defendant offered to pay him and to set him up in the heroin business if he would testify that another person was his heroin supplier and that defendant was merely driving the car owned by this other person.
John Floberg testified that defendant paid him to transport money and heroin between California and Washington during the period September 1984 to February 1985. Craig Wolfe testified that he purchased heroin from defendant weekly during the period August 1984 to April 1985. Tapager and Strange testified that they had seen defendant at Blair's residence on numerous occasions.
Defendant testified that he purchased heroin from Blair on about six occasions, one of which was on May 9, 1985. However, defendant denied being involved in any other heroin transactions and denied that he had agreed to supply heroin to Blair.
II.
A. Admission of Testimony.
Defendant argues that the district court's admission of Blair's testimony that he threatened and attempted to bribe Blair was a "patent violation" of Federal Rule of Evidence 404(b). While defendant objected to admission of Blair's testimony on the basis of Massiah v. United States, 377 U.S. 201, 84 S.Ct. 1199, 12 L.Ed.2d 246 (1964), defendant did not assert, as is required, the specific ground for objection he now urges on appeal. Joint Appendix at 30-37.
Because defendant did not raise Rule 404(b) at trial, this court must consider defendant's argument under the plain error standard of review. Fed.R.Evid. 103; see also Helminski v. Ayerst Laboratories, 766 F.2d 208, 211 (6th Cir.), cert. denied, --- U.S. ----, 106 S.Ct. 386, 88 L.Ed.2d 339 .) (quoting United States v. Frady, 456 U.S. 152, 163, 102 S.Ct. 1584, 1592, 71 L.Ed.2d 816 (1982)), cert. denied, --- U.S. ----, 107 S.Ct. 269, 93 L.Ed.2d 246 (1986).
Rule 404(b) forbids admission of evidence of other crimes or acts when offered "to prove the character of a person in order to show that he acted in conformity therewith." Evidence of other crimes or acts may, however, be admissible for other purposes "such as proof of motive, opportunity, intent, preparation, plan, knowledge, identity, or absence of mistake or accident." Fed.R.Evid. 404(b). The list of permissible uses of evidence of other crimes or acts set forth in Rule 404(b) is neither exhaustive nor conclusive. United States v. Wesevich, 666 F.2d 984, 988 (5th Cir.1982); United States v. Johnson, 634 F.2d 735, 737 (4th Cir.1980), cert. denied, 451 U.S. 907, 101 S.Ct. 1974, 68 L.Ed.2d 295 (1981); United States v. Williams, 577 F.2d 188, 192 (2d Cir.), cert. denied, 439 U.S. 868, 99 S.Ct. 196, 58 L.Ed.2d 179 (1978). Rule 404(b) admits evidence of other crimes or acts if the evidence is not offered to prove the conduct of a person by resort to an inference as to his character, regardless of whether it fits within one of the listed uses. See United States v. Shaw, 701 F.2d 367, 386 (5th Cir.1983), cert. denied, 465 U.S. 1067, 104 S.Ct. 1419, 79 L.Ed.2d 744 (1984); United States v. Bradshaw, 690 F.2d 704, 708 (9th Cir.1982), cert. denied, 463 U.S. 1210, 103 S.Ct. 3543, 77 L.Ed.2d 1392 (1983); United States v. Papadakis, 510 F.2d 287, 294 (2d Cir.), cert. denied, 421 U.S. 950, 95 S.Ct. 1682, 44 L.Ed.2d 104 (1975).
Though not listed in Rule 404(b), spoliation evidence, including evidence that defendant attempted to bribe and threatened a witness, is admissible to show consciousness of guilt. United States v. Corbin, 734 F.2d 643, 656 (11th Cir.1984); United States v. Gonzalez, 703 F.2d 1222, 1223 (11th Cir.1983) (per curiam); United States v. Gonsalves, 668 F.2d 73, 75 (1st Cir.), cert. denied, 456 U.S. 909, 102 S.Ct. 1759, 72 L.Ed.2d 168 (1982); United States v. Monahan, 633 F.2d 984, 985 (1st Cir.1980) (per curiam); United States v. Posey, 611 F.2d 1389, 1391 (5th Cir.1980); United States v. Buigues, 568 F.2d 269, 273 (2d Cir.1978); United States v. Franks, 511 F.2d 25, 36 (6th Cir.), cert. denied, 422 U.S. 1042, 95 S.Ct. 2656, 45 L.Ed.2d 693 (1975). The fact that defendant attempted to bribe and threaten an adverse witness indicates "his consciousness that his case is a weak or unfounded one; and from that consciousness may be inferred the fact itself of the cause's lack of truth and merit." II Wigmore, Evidence § 278 (Chadbourn Rev.1979); see also Gonsalves, 668 F.2d at 75; Monahan, 633 F.2d at 985. Because spoliation evidence tends to establish consciousness of guilt without any inference as to the character of the spoliator, its admission does not violate Rule 404(b). 22 C. Wright & K. Graham, Federal Practice and Procedure § 5240, at 476 (1978).
Although admissible for this purpose, spoliation evidence should not be admitted if its probative value "is substantially outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice." Fed.R.Evid. 403. "Unfair prejudice," as used in Rule 403, does not mean the damage to the defendant's case that results from the legitimate probative force of the evidence; rather, it refers to evidence which tends to suggest decision on an improper basis. Wade v. Haynes, 663 F.2d 778, 783 (8th Cir.1981), aff'd, 461 U.S. 30, 103 S.Ct. 1625, 75 L.Ed.2d 632 (1983); see also Koloda v. General Motors Corp., 716 F.2d 373, 378 (6th Cir.1983). Blair's testimony, although highly probative of defendant's guilt, was not inflammatory and presented little danger of unfair prejudice. See Monahan, 633 F.2d at 985. Thus, the district court's failure to exclude the evidence sua sponte does not rise to the level of plain error.
B. Indirect Entrapment.
Defendant contends that, in light of the evidence that Tapager, Blair and Strange were acting as agents of the government, the district court erred in refusing to instruct the jury on indirect entrapment.1 "To rely on the defense of entrapment, the defendant must admit all elements of the offense." United States v. Whitley, 734 F.2d 1129, 1139 (6th Cir.1984); see also United States v. Robinson, 763 F.2d 778, 782 n. 6 (6th Cir.1985); United States v. Ranzoni, 732 F.2d 555, 560 (6th Cir.), cert. denied, 469 U.S. 916, 105 S.Ct. 292, 83 L.Ed.2d 228 (1984). Since defendant denied participation in the offense charged, he could not assert his entrapment defense at trial and cannot raise it on appeal. Ranzoni, 732 F.2d at 560.
III.
The judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.
The indirect entrapment defense, adopted by the Second Circuit in United States v. Valencia, 645 F.2d 1158 (2d Cir.1980), has not been adopted by this court. United States v. McLernon, 746 F.2d 1098, 1109 (6th Cir.1984)As one of the largest grid simulation labs in the world, the InteGrid Test and Development Laboratory gives clients a unique facility to model, test and validate new technologies prior to field deployment.

Scallops with Honeydew-Avocado Salsa
Lately I've been overwhelmed with emotions. I mean, in exactly one week, I'll be an official student in Sullivan University's Culinary Arts program. I'm scared. Scared that I won't be good enough. Excited. Excited that I'm taking a leap of faith. And ready. Ready for anything that's thrown at me.
It will be a big change. One of the biggest decisions I've made in my life to just jump into something new. Something that I'm passionate about. Something that won't make me a lot of money. But you know what. I don't care about money, never did. As long as I have a roof over my head, food in my belly, and my bills are paid - I'm content. I want to do something that will truly make me happy at the end of the day. And I feel that taking this leap of faith and starting into a career that I truly feel that I can succeed in - will keep me happy at the end of every day.
So I wanted to let you know that starting next week, I may not be as present in the blogosphere. I'm going to see how my new schedule affects my day-to-day and then revamp my blogging schedule accordingly. Maybe I'll even do a new post series of "what-I've-learned-in-culinary-school-this-week". Who knows. But bear with me. Stay with me. I promise I won't disappear. And hell, who knows - maybe I'll still be able to post daily like I try to do now.
Ingredients:
Adapted from Food & Wine's recipe
Zest of 1 lime
juice from 1 lime
1 tablespoon olive oil
1 small honeydew melon, rind removed and diced
1 avocado, diced
salt and pepper, to taste
16 sea scallops
Black beans, optional
In a medium bowl, combine the lime zest, lime juice, and olive oil. Toss in the melon and avocado and coat well with lime-olive oil mixture. Season with salt and pepper, to taste.
Brush the scallops with olive and season with salt and pepper. Heat a large skillet under medium high heat. Sear scallops for about 3 to 4 minutes per side, or until golden brown.
Serve the scallops with the honeydew salsa and black beans.
This dish was simple and made us feel real good after eating it. And not to mention it's just darn pretty to look at!
Speaking of pretty to look at, we recently had one of Andy's friends over for dinner. His girlfriend happens to be the pastry chef for the restaurant Proof On Main, here in Louisville. She brought dessert - a corn gelato (Oh. my. god. was it good!) and chocolate cake. Just look at how awesome this looks!
And talking with her really excited me for the upcoming weeks. They both loved the dinner I cooked them, which I was nervous about because I've never had a true culinary professional eat something I've made. And she told me about her journey to becoming the pastry chef she is today which was definitely inspiring, as well. She's even trying to start her own business - Sugar Monster Sweets
I mean, just checking out those cakes makes me jealous of her mad skills! Anybody in Louisville or the surrounding areas in need of a cake or sweet treat of any kind should definitely look into her!
Hope you guys have a great Tuesday!

According to the BBC, the agreement was for €10 million (£8.3m) and the player will now discuss personal terms before undergoing a medical.
It appears that Monreal has been targeted by Arsene Wenger after seeing first-choice left-back Kieran Gibbs suffer a thigh injury in Wednesday’s draw with Liverpool that will rule him out for three weeks. Currently, the much maligned Andre Santos is the club’s only established and fit left-back.
Monreal, 26, joined from Osasuna in the summer of 2011, but appears set to become the latest player to be sold by Malaga after the investment dried up from their Qatari owners. Monreal will be reunited at the Emirates with Santi Cazorla, who Arsenal signed last summer.
Meanwhile, Sky Sports has reported that an unnamed Premier League club has triggered the release clause for West Ham midfielder Mohamed Diame.
Arsenal have been strongly linked to the Senegal international throughout the transfer window and Wenger has spoken highly of the 25-year-old. Stories emerged earlier in the month that Diame had a £3.5 million release clause inserted into his contract when he signed on a free transfer from Wigan earlier in the summer. However, in the last few days it has been claimed that the figure was closer to £7 million.
Diame would potentially act as a replacement for Alex Song, who departed for Barcelona last summer. Since Song’s exit, Wenger has been dependent on Abou Diaby to provide much-needed dynamism in the midfield. However, Diaby has again missed much of the season through injury.
You can watch a video of Diame's fine goal for West Ham against Arsenal earlier this season, below.

Brendan Rodgers was hot on the former Barcelona star’s heels in January, but unable to offer him assurances over regular first team football, the Mali international opted to join Valencia in a six-month deal instead.

Excerpt
moreCHAPTER ONE
Late Spring, Maryland
Before tonight, the closest Tess Bailey had come to a strip club was on TV, where beautiful women danced seductively in G-strings, taut young body parts bouncing and gleaming from a stage that sparkled and flashed.
In the Gentlemen’s Den, thousands of miles from Hollywood in a rundown neighborhood north of Washington, D.C., the mirror ball was broken, and the aging stripper on the sagging makeshift stage looked tired and cold.
“Whoops.” Nash turned his back to the noisy room, carefully keeping his face in the shadows. “That’s Gus Mondelay sitting with Decker,” he told Tess.
Diego Nash had the kind of face that stood out in a crowd. And Nash obviously didn’t want Mondelay—whoever he was—to see him.
Tess followed him back toward the bar, away from the table where Lawrence Decker, Nash’s longtime Agency partner, was working undercover.
She bumped into someone. “Excuse me—”
Oh my God! The waitresses weren’t wearing any shirts. The Gentlemen’s Den wasn’t just a strip club, it was also a topless bar. She grabbed Nash’s hand and dragged him down the passageway that led to the pay phone and the restrooms. It was dark back there, with the added bonus of nary a half-naked woman in sight.
She had to say it. “This was just a rumor—”
He pinned her up against the wall and nuzzled her neck, his arms braced on either side of her. She was stunned for only about three seconds before she realized that two men had staggered out of the men’s room. This was just another way for Nash to hide his face.
She pretended that she was only pretending to melt as he kissed her throat and jawline, as he waited until Drunk and Drunker pushed past them before he spoke, his breath warm against her ear. “There were at least four shooters set up and waiting out front in the parking lot. And those were just the ones I spotted as we were walking in.”
The light in the parking lot had been dismal. Tess’s concentration had alternated between her attempts not to catch her foot in a pothole and fall on her face, and the two biker types who appeared to be having, quite literally, a pissing contest. Not to mention the unbelievable fact that she was out in the real world with the legendary Diego Nash . . .
They were now alone in the hallway, but Nash hadn’t moved out of whispering range. He was standing so close, Tess’s nose was inches from the collar of his expensive shirt. He smelled outrageously good. “Who’s Gus Mondelay?” she asked.
“An informant,” he said tersely, the muscle in the side of his perfect jaw jumping. “He’s on the Agency payroll, but lately I’ve been wondering . . .” He shook his head. “It fits that he’s here, now. He’d enjoy watching Deck get gunned down.” The smile he gave her was grim. “Thanks for having the presence of mind to call me.”
Tess still couldn’t believe the conversation she’d overheard just over an hour ago at Agency headquarters.
A rumor had come in that Lawrence Decker’s cover had been blown and there was an ambush being set to kill him. The Agency’s night shift support staff had attempted to contact him, but had been able to do little more than leave a message on his voice mail. 007. “You go home.”
“I can help.”
He’d already dismissed her. “You’ll help more by leaving.”
“I’ve done the training,” she informed him, blocking his route back to the bar. “I’ve got an application in for a field agent position. It’s just a matter of time before—”
Nash shook his head. “They’re not going to take you. They’re never going to take you. Look, Bailey, thanks for the ride, but—”
“Tess,” she said. He had a habit of calling the support staff by their last names, but tonight she was here, in the field. “And they are too going to take me. Brian Underwood told me—”
“Brian Underwood was stringing you along because he was afraid you would quit and he needs you on support. You’ll excuse me if I table this discussion on your lack of promotability and start focusing on the fact that my partner is about to—”
 pulled off her T-shirt, took off her bra, and handed both to him.
“What message should I give him?” she asked.
Nash looked at her, looked at the shirt and wispy lace of bra dangling from his hand, looked at her again.
Looked at her. “Jeez, Bailey.”
Tess.”
Tess gave him a disbelieving look and an outraged noise. “I do not.” For God’s sake, she was standing here half naked—
But he reached for her, unfastening the top button of her jeans and unzipping them.
“Hey!” She tried to pull back, but he caught her.
“Don’t you watch MTV?” he asked, folding her pants down so that they were more like hip huggers, his fingers warm against her skin.
Her belly button was showing now, as well as the top of her panties, the zipper of her jeans precariously half pulled down. “Yeah, in all my limitless free time.”
“You could use some lipstick.” Nash stepped back and looked at her critically, then, with both hands, completely messed up her short hair. He stepped back and looked again. “That’s a little better.”
Gee, thanks. “Message?” she said.
“Tell Decker to stay put for now,” Nash ordered. “They’re not going to hit him inside. Don’t tell him that—he knows. That’s what I’m telling you, you understand?”
Tess nodded.
“I’m going to make a perimeter circuit of this place,” he continued. “I’ll meet you right back here—no, in the ladies’ room—in ten minutes. Give the message to Deck, be brief, don’t blow it by trying to tell him too much, then get your ass in the ladies’ room and stay there until I’m back. Is that clear?”
Tess nodded again. She’d never seen this Nash before—this order-barking, cold-bloodedly decisive commander. She’d never seen the Nash he’d become in the car, on the way over here, before either. After she’d made that first phone call, she’d picked him up downtown. She’d told him again, in greater detail, all that she’d overheard as they’d headed to the Gentlemen’s Den. He’d gotten very quiet, very grim, when his attempts to reach Decker on his cell phone had failed.
He’d been scared, she’d realized as she’d glanced at him. He had been genuinely frightened that they were too late, that the hit had already gone down, that his partner—his friend—was already dead.
When they got here and the parking lot was quiet, when they walked inside and spotted Decker still alive and breathing, there had been a fraction of a second in which Tess had been sure Nash was going to faint from relief.
It was eye-opening. It was possible that Diego Nash was human after all.
Tess gave him one last smile, then headed down the hall toward one of those little serving trays on the bar. God, she was about to walk into a room filled with drunken men, with her breasts bare and her pants halfway down her butt. Still, it couldn’t possibly be worse than that supercritical once-over Nash had given her.
“Tess.” He caught her arm, and she looked back at him. “Be careful,” he said.
She nodded again. “You, too.”
He smiled then—a flash of straight white teeth. “Deck’s going to shit monkeys when he sees you.”
With that, he was gone.
Tess grabbed the tray from the bar and pushed her way out into the crowd.
Something was wrong.
Decker read it in Gus Mondelay’s eyes, in the way the heavyset man was sitting across from him at the table.
Although it was possible that the wrong he was reading was due to the four beef enchiladas Mondelay had wolfed down at Joey’s Mexican Shack twenty minutes before meeting Decker here.
But Deck didn’t trust Mondelay any farther than he could throw him. And something about the sound of the man’s voice when he’d called to set up this meeting with Freedom Network leader Tim Ebersole had made Decker leave early enough to follow Mondelay as he left work, and to trail him over here. But aside from the Shack, Mondelay hadn’t made any other stops before arriving at the Gentlemen’s Den. He hadn’t talked to anyone on his cell phone either.
Mondelay gestured for Decker to lean closer—it was the only way to be heard over the loud music. “Tim must be running late.”
Jesus, Mondelay had a worse than usual case of dog breath tonight.
“I’m in no hurry,” Decker said, leaning back again in his seat. Air. Please God, give him some air.
Gus Mondelay had come into contact with the Freedom Network while serving eighteen months in Wallens Ridge Prison for possession of an illegal firearm. The group’s name made them sound brave and flag-wavingly patriotic, but they were really just more bubbas—the Agency nickname for homegrown terrorists with racist, neo-Nazi leanings and a fierce hatred for the federal government. And for all agents of the federal government.
Such as Decker.
Even though Deck’s specialty was terrorist cells of the foreign persuasion, he’d been introduced to informant Gus Mondelay when the man had coughed up what seemed to be evidence that these particular bubbas and al-Qaeda were working in tandem.
Those insane-sounding allegations could not be taken lightly even though Deck himself couldn’t make sense of the scenario. If there was anyone the bubbas hated more than federal agents, it was foreigners. Although the two groups certainly could have found common ground in their hatred of Israel and the Jews.
So Dougie Brendon, the newly appointed Agency director, had assigned Decker to Gus Mondelay. Deck was to use Mondelay to try to work his way deeper into the Freedom Network, with the goal of being present at one of the meetings with members of the alleged al-Qaeda cell.
So far all Mondelay had given him were leads that had gone nowhere.
In return, Decker sat with him night after night, watching emotionally numb women gyrate unenthusiastically in one sleazy strip club after another where he was assaulted by crappy rock music played at brain-jarring decibels. He, of course, paid for the drinks.
Mondelay made the come-closer-to-talk gesture again. “I’m going to give Tim a call, see what’s holding him up,” he said as he pried his cell phone out of his pants pocket.
Decker watched as the other man keyed in a speed dial number, then held his phone to his face, plugging his other ear with one knockwurst-sized finger. Yeah, that would help him hear over the music.
It wouldn’t have been quite so awful to sit here if only the DJ played some Aerosmith every now and then.
Or if the strippers or waitresses in this place bothered to smile— Jesus, or even scowl, for that matter. But their perpetually bored expressions were depressing as hell. They didn’t even bother to be pissed at the fact that they were being exploited.
Mondelay sat back in his chair as whomever he was calling picked up. Decker couldn’t hear the conversation, but he could read lips. He turned his head so that Mondelay was right at the edge of his field of vision.
What the fuck is taking so long? Pause, then, No way, asshole, you were supposeda call me. I been sitting here for almost an hour now, waiting for the fucking goat head.
Huh?
Fuck you, too, douche bag. Mondelay hung up his phone, leaned toward Decker. “I got the locale wrong,” he said. “Tim and the others are over at the Bull Run. It was my mistake. Tim says we should come on over. Join them there.”
No. There was no way in hell that Mondelay had been talking to Tim. Decker had heard him on the phone with Tim in the past, and it had been all “Yes, sir,” and “Right away, sir.” “Let me kiss your ass, sir,” not “Fuck you, too, douche bag.”
Something was rotten in the Gentlemen’s Den—something besides Mondelay’s toxic breath, that is.
Mondelay wasn’t waiting on any goat head. He was waiting for the go ahead. The son of a bitch was setting Decker up.
Mondelay began the lengthy process of pushing his huge frame up and out of the seat.
“You boys aren’t leaving, are you?”
Decker looked up and directly into the eyes of Tess Bailey, the computer specialist from the Agency support office.
But okay, no. Truth be told, the first place he looked wasn’t into her eyes.
She’d moved to D.C. a few years ago, from somewhere in the Midwest. Kansas? A small town, she’d told them once when Nash had asked. Her father was a librarian.
Funny he should remember that about her right now.
Because, holy shit, Toto, Tess Bailey didn’t look like she was in small-town Kansas anymore.
“There’s a lady over at the bar who wants to buy your next round,” Tess told him as she shouted to be heard over the music, as he struggled to drag his eyes up to her face.
Nash. The fact that she was here and half-naked—no, forget the half-naked part, although, Jesus, that was kind of hard to do when she was standing there half-fricking-naked—had to mean that Nash was here, too. And if Nash was here, that meant Decker was right about Mondelay setting him up, and he was about to be executed. Or at least kidnapped.
He glanced at Mondelay, at the nervous energy that seemed to surround the big man. No, he’d gotten it right the first time. Mondelay was setting him up to be hit.
Son of a bitch.
“She said you were cute,” Tess was shouting at Decker, trying desperately for eye contact. He gave it to her. Mostly. “She’s over there, in the back.” She pointed toward the bar with one arm, using the other to hold her tray up against her chest, which made it a little bit easier to pay attention to what she was saying, despite the fact that it still didn’t make any sense. Cute? Who was in the back of the bar?
Nash, obviously.
“So what can I get you?” Tess asked, all cheery smile and adorable freckled nose, and extremely bare breasts beneath that tray she was clutching to herself.
“We’re on our way out,” Mondelay informed her.
“Free drinks,” Tess said enticingly. “You should sit back down and stay a while.” She looked pointedly at Deck.
A message from Nash. “I’ll have another beer,” Decker shouted up at her with a nod of confirmation.
Mondelay laughed his disbelief. “I thought you wanted to meet Tim.”
Decker made himself smile up at the man who’d set him up to be killed. Two pals, out making the rounds of the strip clubs. “Yeah, I do.”
“Well, they’re waiting for us now.”
“That’s good,” Decker said. “They can wait. We don’t want to look too eager, right?” He looked at Tess again. “Make it imported.”
Mondelay looked at her, too, narrowing his eyes slightly—a sign that he was probably thinking. “You’re new here, aren’t you?”
“He’ll have another beer, too.” Decker dismissed Tess, hoping she’d take the hint and disappear, fast.
Mondelay was in one hell of a hurry to leave, but he was never in too much of a hurry not to harass a waitress when he had the chance. “Whatcha hiding there, honey?”
“I’ll get those beers.”
Tess was just a little too late. Mondelay had already caught the bottom of her tray, keeping her from leaving. He tugged on it, pulling it away from her, and she let him, but not because she wanted to. She was still smiling, but she wasn’t a good enough liar to hide her discomfort completely. Decker had to look away, hating the fact that she was subjecting herself to this, for him.
Yeah, who was he kidding here? She was doing this for James “Diego” Nash.
“How long’ve you worked here?” Mondelay asked her.
The volume of the music dropped as the routine ended and the stripper left the stage. There’d be about ten minutes for their ears to recover before the next woman started to dance.
“Not very long,” Tess said. It was still noisy, but she didn’t have to shout quite so loudly anymore.
“You need to work on your all-over tan.”
“Yeah,” she said, cool as could be. “I know.”
“Let her get those beers,” Decker said.
“I’d throw her a bang,” Mondelay said as if Tess weren’t even standing there. “Wouldn’t you?”
Deck had been trying to pretend that a woman who was pole dancing on the other side of the bar had caught his full attention, but now he was forced to look up and appraise Tess, whom he knew had a photo of her two little nieces in a frame on her desk along with a plastic action figure of Buffy the Vampire Slayer. He knew it was Buffy because Nash had asked her about it once, and she’d told them it represented both female empowerment and the fact that most people had inner depths not apparent to the casual observer.
Decker felt a hot rush of anger at Nash, who, no doubt, had been taking his flirtation with Tess to the next level when the call came in that Decker needed assistance. He wasn’t sure what pissed him off more—the fact that Nash had sent Tess in here without her shirt, or that Nash was sleeping with her.
“Yeah,” he said now to Mondelay, since they’d been talking about the waitresses in these bars like this all week. He gave Tess a smile that he hoped she’d read as an apology for the entire male population. “I would also send her flowers afterward.”
“Tell me, hon, do women really go for that sentimental bullshit?” Mondelay asked Tess.
“Nah,” she said. “What we really love is being objectified, used, and cast aside. Why else would I have gotten a job here? I mean, aside from the incredible health plan and the awesome 401(k).”
Decker laughed as she finally managed to tug her tray free and headed toward the bar.
He watched her go, aware of the attention she was getting from the other lowlifes in the bar, noting the soft curve of her waist and the way that, although she wasn’t very tall, she carried herself as if she stood head and shoulders above the crowd. He was also aware that it had been a very long time since he’d sent a woman flowers.
They were in some serious shit here. Whoever set up this ambush had paramilitary training.
There were too many shooters in position around the building. He couldn’t take them all out.
Well, he could. The setup was professional, but the shooters were all amateurs. He could take them all out, one by one by one. And like the first two he’d encountered, most of them wouldn’t even hear him coming.
But Jimmy Nash’s hands were already shaking from clearing that roof. A cigarette would’ve helped, but last time he’d quit, he’d sworn it was for good.
He washed his hands in the sink in the men’s, trying, through sheer force of will, to make them stop trembling.
It was that awful picture he had in his head of Decker gunned down in the parking lot that steadied him and made his heart stop hammering damn near out of his chest.
He’d do anything for Deck.
They’d been Agency partners longer than most marriages lasted these days. Seven years. Who’d have believed that was possible? Two fucked-up, angry men, one of them—him—accustomed to working alone, first cousin to the devil, and the other a freaking Boy Scout, a former Navy SEAL. . . .
When Tess had called him tonight and told him what she’d overheard, that HQ essentially knew Decker was being targeted and that they weren’t busting their asses to keep it from happening . . .
The new Agency director, Doug-the-prick Brendon, hadn’t tried to hide his intense dislike of Jimmy Nash, and therefore Decker by association. But this was going too fucking far.
Jimmy used his wet hands to push his hair back from his face, forcing himself to meet his eyes in the mirror.
Murderous eyes.
After he got Decker safely out of here, he was going to hunt down Dougie Brendon, and . . .
And spend the rest of your life in jail? Jimmy could practically hear Deck’s even voice.
First they’d have to catch me, he pointed out. And they wouldn’t. He’d made a vow, a long time ago, to do whatever he had to do, so that he’d never get locked up again.
There are other ways to blow off steam. How many times had Decker said those exact words to him?
Other ways . . .
Like Tess Bailey.
Who was waiting for him in the ladies’ room. Who was unbelievably hot. Who liked him—really liked him. He’d seen it in her eyes. She pretended to have a cold-day-in-July attitude when he flirted with her in the office. But Jimmy saw beyond it, and he knew with just a little more charm and a little bit of well-placed pressure, she’d be giving him a very brightly lit green light. Tonight.
He’d let Decker handle Doug Brendon.
Jimmy would handle Tess.

Milonga del Angel
Artist
Al Di Meola (guitar, percussion)
CD
Diabolic Inventions and Seduction for Solo Guitar, Volume 1: Music of Astor Piazzolla (Inakustik 9080)
Musicians:
Al Di Meola (guitar, percussion).
Composed by Astor Piazzolla.
Recorded: Rhinebeck, New York, January 2006
Rating: 90/100 (learn more)
I have a passion for Piazzolla, and look with satisfaction on how the music of this great master of nuevo tango still lives on more than 15 years after his death -- although his influence flourishes mostly outside the perimeter of the jazz world. Piazzolla had some interactions with jazz players during his career, perhaps most notably in his 1986 live recording with Gary Burton, but I am nonetheless surprised at how little attention the jazzistas pay to his legacy. By comparison, the bossa, samba, reggae and salsa styles seem to have penetrated the jazz mind more deeply. But Piazzolla and the tango tradition are just as potent as these other idioms, and one could profitably spend years exploring their riches.
Al Di Meola has done just that. He has been an advocate of Piazzolla's music for more than a decade, and previously recorded "Milonga del Angel" on his Di Meola Plays Piazzolla CD. He now contributes an intimate solo version as part of his first-rate recent release Diabolic Inventions and Seduction for Solo Guitar, Volume 1: Music of Astor Piazzolla. If you remember Al Di Meola for his fusion work and his stint with Return to Forever, you haven't experienced the full measure of his artistry. From the first, Di Meola had deep roots in World Music -- his flamenco flourishes are as authentic as you will find this side of the Atlantic, and his feel for the tango idiom could hardly be any deeper. This heartfelt performance is a fitting tribute to Piazzolla, and a reminder of how fine a guitarist Al Di Meola can be when placed in the right setting.

The Dozens: 12 Essential Tango Tracks by Ted GioiaAimee, I so hear ya on the "I still love them (except when I don't)." Ha! Good to know that feeling never dies. I suppose that's true with most things in life, right? Nothing will be always endearing! And your locs are down to your waist? In your profile pic they looks a foot shorter so they must've grown quickly!
Scruffy, mine have definitely tightened & shortened up within the last few months. I'm a little baffled by how uneven they are! I need to trim up the back because they are about 2 inches longer on the right side, I kid you not. I'm not sure why that happened but my hair is on an angle in the back. Oops. And the ones at the nape of my neck and in front are super short. What's up with that? I will admit that I've been trimming the whispy ends that aren't knotting up but not *that* much more. Whatever, though. I don't mind the unevenness. What still occasionally bugs me are all the loops. I've gotten better at crocheting them but it's time consuming. I ran into a random woman a few weeks ago who gave me the number of a local stylist who crochets dreads for maintenance. After I had my dreads professionally maintained, I realized in hindsight that what he did made the loops worse after a couple weeks. No need to go into the details (unless someone is interested) but no more of him in my life. For now, I keep crocheting them myself, trying to get them tightened up & not so loopy and maybe someday I can try out this new woman recommended to me. Again, wish I could just go with the flow & neglect them forever but nope, I'm not there yet....probably never will be!
I love looking at all the photos! I just realized that if you click on someone's posted pic it will take you to a gallery of all the pics in this thread. Nice. I looked at every single one before I started writing this.

Restarted my no-poo journey again today! By New Year's, I should be ready for dreads and have them oil free!
<a href=""><img src="" width="400" height="80" border="0" alt="Lilypie Pregnancy tickers" /></a>
Koru -- your dreads look great!
"Our lives begin to end the day we become silent about things that matter" ~~ MLK
Thanks, ShadowMoon! And Becky, here ya go again! I have confidence you're going to love them this go 'round.
I trimmed my locs last night, asking my girls to even out a few in the back and I seriously only cut about 1" off a handful of dreads but somehow my hair feels 5" shorter. Ha! I've had long hair for years & these dreadies tightening up & shortening are starting to look unlike my head. Thankfully my hair grows fast so hopefully it will feel a normal length again soon.
I've been wearing them down lately (did I mention this already?) and it feels good to brave the "wildness." For the first 6-8 months I never left the house without a hat or wrap but I've been sneaking out, unfettered, these past couple months & I'm lovin' it. It takes a while to feel totally comfortable with this not-so-common look but I think I'm finally here.
stephanie
Wow Koru, those are beautiful! I have also recently started wearing them down in public so I know how you feel. Of course it doesn't help that I live in Mississippi where dreads are practically unheard of. My dreads are about a year and a half old. Started by backcombing once and then left them alone. Glad I found you guys! I will try to post pictures but my computer ate them so I need to take some more.
Crunchymama19 those dreads are THICK! Awesome! How old are they?
<a href=""><img src="" width="400" height="80" border="0" alt="Lilypie Pregnancy tickers" /></a>
Thanks Becky! They are about a year and a half old and yes THICK. I love them.
I can't believe they're only 1 1/2 years old! I'm approaching a year & feel ages behind that. Yours look so, ummm, tubular. That's the only word I can think of but mine are still so loopy & wild feeling. The look great!
stephanie
crunchymama 19, where in MS are you? I live in Louisiana and have lots of family in Mississippi.
Delicate Sunshine - I am in Northern Missisippi, south of Memphis TN. We just moved here this summer. We have visited Louisiana before though and loved it!
koru - They matured surprisingly quickly, especially since my "normal" hair is pin-straight and fine, but does tangle easily. The pics don't show it but I still do have a lot of loose hairs, mostly at the ends with some pretty loopy and knobby tips. DH complains they tickle his face when we sleep, lol.
So we found out a couple of weeks ago I am pregnant with #3! For you mamas that had dreads while pregnant, did you notice any extra growth or anything? I would love a side effect to be gaining some extra length on these pups.
Oh yay! Congratulations!!!
<a href=""><img src="" width="400" height="80" border="0" alt="Lilypie Pregnancy tickers" /></a>
Congratulations!!
By the way, I am right across the river from Natchez, MS so it's quite a drive. Let me know if you ever head this way though :)
I'm about 6 months pregnant and I think they've grown a bit quicker... I did a massive trim in the fall and they seem to have grown quite a bit since then.
I'm going to start a new thread.

The Emmy-nominated (and past two-time winner) "Breaking Bad" star has announced a scavenger hunt for anyone in the Hollywood area as a lead-in to Monday night's Emmys awards. Paul announced the challenge on his Instagram account (see below).
READ MORE: Emmy Nominee Aaron Paul Explains Why Binge-Watching is 'The Future' of TV
Basically, he's given anyone living outside the Hollywood area four days to get to LA in order to participate, a heads up many New Mexico fans undoubtedly appreciate. Details beyond what's posted in the feed are scarce, but it's not the first time Paul has provided a competition to build excitement for his star-making show.
To build anticipation perhaps past the breaking point for the final eight episodes of "Breaking Bad," Paul held a scavenger hunt in Boise, Idaho last September. Winners got to watch a live stream of "Ozymandias," the soul-crushing episode directed by Rian Johnson. The fun-loving Paul also hid tickets to a series finale screening with he and Bryan Cranston around Hollywood the day the show ended its incredible run.
Don't count on the prizes for his latest scavenger hunt to be in the same place, though. The 66th Annual Primetime Emmys air Monday night at 8pm ET / 5pm PT at the Nokia Theater in Los Angeles (and live on NBC). "Breaking Bad" is nominated for eight Emmys, including Paul for Outstanding Supporting Actor in a Drama.Pleasure P - Best New Songs, Albums, & Features

Very unique approach to shredding the ole' Ax!
However i believe she's able to do it because she using what sounds like Open E tuning, if you notice, when she's strumming and her left hand isn't touching the fret board it still sounds harmonious... that wouldn't be the case in standard EADGBE tuning.
If you were to tune guitar as such, you could probably do something unique and unorthidox like that without too much trouble
Very cool, nevertheless.

Almost 1,500 Irish citizens overseas sought consular assistance from the Department of Foreign Affairs this year, figures released today show.
Support was provided in the case of 194 deaths and 290 arrests, as well as hospitalisations, accidents, and several child abductions.
While assistance was given to Irish citizens in almost every country in the world, the highest number of emergencies occurred in Spain, followed by Australia, the US, Britain, Turkey, Thailand, Canada, UAE, Germany, Italy, the Netherlands, Greece, Poland and Portugal.
More than 180 cases were dealt with by dedicated consular offices in Gdansk and Poznan during the Euro 2012 Finals, and several hundred fans were given advice during the tournament.
A statement issued from the Department of Foreign Affairs today said they are continuing to monitor the situation in the Middle East closely, and have maintained contact with Irish citizens in Syria, Israel and the Occupied Territories through the Irish embassies in Cairo and Tel Aviv.
Commenting on the figures, Tánaiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs Eamon Gilmore expressed his condolences to those whose family members died abroad, and commended the staff of Irish embassies and consulates for the support they provide to Irish nationals who get into difficulty overseas.
He urged travellers to obtain appropriate medical and travel insurance to avoid the burden placed on families in the event of an accident or medical emergency.
.”
He also recommended that Irish people register online with the Department before travelling, so next-of-kin details are on file in case of an emergency.

Though Ultron could offer a more dynamic villain storyline with his knowledge of technology, and our reliance on it. He could do anything from crashing planes, and hacking agencies, to building a robotic army, and turning every techmological device on earth into a weapon. The possibilities are endless story wise. He's much more fitting for this time period. Kang may be a bit too similar to Thanos to casuals. I do love Kang though, he should definitely be in guardians of the galaxy 2 or 3.

Haven’t seen it….on the yotube page for that video is a spiel from the producers which is pretty interesting.
MERAH PUTIH, the first film of the Freedom Trilogy, a three-film co-production by PT Media Desa Indonesia, owned by Hashim Djojohadikusumo, and international film production company Margate House, Ltd., owned by Rob Allyn and Jeremy Stewart. Set against a historically authentic backdrop of Indonesias struggle for independence in 1947 during the Van Mook offensive into the heart of republican territory in Central Java, MERAH PUTIH tells the story of a fictional band of freedom fighters who bond together as cadets to survive a massacre, fighting on as guerrilla soldiers to become true children of the nation, despite their sharp conflicts and deep differences in social class, ethnicity, geographic origin, religion and personality.
Directed by Yadi Sugandi, Indonesias most celebrated cinematographer and Director of Photography for LASKAR PELANGI, UNDER THE TREE, TIGA HARI UNTUK SELAMANYA and THE PHOTOGRAPH, MERAH PUTIH features an all-star ensemble cast of Indonesias most talented young actors: Lukman Sardi (LASKAR PELANGI, QUICKIE EXPRESS, 9 NAGA, GIE), Doni Alamsyah (FIKSI, 9 NAGA, GIE), Darius Sinathrya (UNGU VIOLET, DBIJIS, NAGA BONAR JADI 2, LOVE), Zumi Zola (KAWIN LARIS), T. Rifnu Wikana (KADO HARI JADI, LASKAR PELANGI). The film also stars Astri Nurdin and introduces London-and-Hollywood-trained actress Rahayu Saraswati.
Shot in 35-millimeter film, MERAH PUTIH gathered a topflight team of special effects and technical experts with experience in Hollywood films: British Special Effects Coordinator Adam Howarth (SAVING PRIVATE RYAN, BLACKHAWK DOWN), Stunt Coordinator Rocky McDonald (MISSION IMPOSSIBLE II, THE QUIET AMERICAN), Make-Up and Visual Effects Artist Rob Trenton (BATMAN – THE DARK KNIGHT), Key Armorer John Bowring (CROCODILE DUNDEE II, THE MATRIX, THE THIN RED LINE, AUSTRALIA, X-MEN ORIGINS:WOLVERINE) and First Assistant Director Mark Knight (DECEMBER BOYS, BEAUTIFUL).
MERAH PUTIH will be released national wide in theatre starting August 13th, 2009 at theatre networks of 21 and Blitzmegaplex.
late-night screening, barely fifty people in the audience, at Bioskop Slipi.
My general impression from searching around is that there is not a huge amount of interest in this film, far less than say for some of the Islamic films like Ketika Cinta Bertasbih.
Also, there’s another production with same name, ‘Merah Putih':
a six-part mini-series and feature film about the Indonesian War of Independence with me playing Captain Schaffer, a Dutch officer.
‘Me’ is David John Watton, here’s a teaser video, somebody’s been watching too many Vietnam War movies I think
aahh… I hope Darius acts better than he does in the daily sinetrons!!!!!!!!!!!
While this sort of jingoistic nationalism usually makes me cringe, given that many Indonesians appear to be moving away from the pancasila values the country was founded on, I’ll look at it a bit more kindly than I would in a lot of other situations..
Sort of on topic and was just reading a blog post with the above. An example given was Hong Kong
In a sense Britain, through its actions in Hong Kong, did more to reduce world poverty than all the aid programs undertaken in the last century.
But Indonesia is not Hong Kong and the Dutch weren’t the British. So obviously the Dutch exploited Indonesia and Indonesians, that is the point of colonialism, whether it has positive by-products or not, but if the replacement for it is native elites (and foreign companies) exploiting Indonesia and its people then….this kind of film seems to just pull the wool over people’s eyes or glorify something that makes little difference to everyday peoples lives. Just putting that out there.
Agree with you, of course, Patung, that the British Empire was a tremendous force for good, and that some others, e.g. Belgian and less so Dutch, were less good.
But colonialism was not all about exploitation.
A genuine sense of mission, religious and political, motivated many Brits, and the results were all the schools, hospitals, roads etc. Much as the Romans did for us, and had the Saxons not interfered, no doubt Brits of old would in due course have demanded self-determination. Evidence suggests that Arthur and Co. were Brits eager to preserve their roman status.
But the film was not a glorification of people like Sukarno, who were such keen collaborators with the Japs. It showed ordinary folks fighting for something they believed in, much as our not-so-distant ancestors took up arms joyfully to do battle for independence in 1939.
Where are you getting that opinion, Patung?
Britain did a great job in the very limited domain of Hong Kong, but its record elsewhere is extremely spotty. Britain’s record in early settler colonialism is abysmal, though it improves in the high colonial period. The Netherlands was a worse colonial overlord, if you are comparing high colonial regimes, as it built less of lasting value and took more brazenly. Belgium was the absolute worst.
Well, in India we did okay, and in Africa.
If you mean Aussie and Canada, those two countries turned out pretty well, much as the Anglo-Saxons and Normans did a fairly decent job of bringing Britain through to developed status, and the Franks rebuilt Gaul quite well once they got established.
Pre-White North America and Australia were not exactly paradisical, though I admit the Maoris got a raw deal in NZ.
Of course, I’m talking about the effect of colonialism on already existing populations. Bit hard to say it “turned out well” for the Aborigines or Native North Americans, isn’t it?
It was from here –, it’s very long, talks mainly about British Egypt and Belgian Congo…
It is good to keep in mind that actual full scale military action from the Dutch side was limited to two short periods of altogether four and a half weeks in four years (21st July – 5th Aug.1947 and 19th Dec.1948 – 5th Jan.1949). The Dutch called these “police actions” and the Indonesians refer to these periods as “agresi militer” I and II.
The territory of what was then called the “Republic”, which had its main seat in Yogyakarta, and that of the colonial governement and its military apparatus were separated by a “demarcation line”. This line was continuously transgressed by Indonesian guerillas. In the socalled Renville Agreement of 17th Jan. 1948 the Republic acknowledged the line that the Dutch army had reached in the first ‘agresi militer’ as demarcation line and bound itself to no longer infiltrate Dutch occupied territory. This was an empty promise. Indonesian civil servants and village heads cooperating with the colonial government remained subject to intimidation and terror.
Presumably the film Merah Putih retains a discrete silence about these matters.
Odinius, totally unhindered by any real information on these matters, keeps airing his prejudices and non-arguments about the comparative merits or demerits of colonial governments.
I have earlier referred to the writings of a contemporary witness who was well briefed on both Dutch and British colonial policy: J.S.Furnivall. He is an acknowledged authority on this matter (the Encyclopedia Britannica refers, in the bibliography to its entry “colonialism”, to his writings as an “illuminating comparative study of colonial policies”). Furnivall’s comparison certainly did not lead to Odinius’ “conclusions”.
To judge the comparative merits of erstwhile colonial states on what has remained after more than sixty years of independence is about as enlightening as judging the quality of a soccer coach in greatgrandfather’s generation on the basis of ‘his’ team’s performance today.
Factors that should be taken into account in these matters are:
1. the impact of the Japanese occupation (not present in India)
2. the nature of the decolonisation process – conflictuous or non- conflictuous, and directly linked to that
3. the position of the established traditional elite: destroyed or retained during the decolonisation process (the former was the case in Indonesia, the latter in Malaysia)
4. the position of the trading minorities (far stronger in Malaysia than in Indonesia as far as the Chinese are concerned – in 1956/57 Indonesia nationalised also all Dutch owned enterprises and required all Dutch citizens to leave the country – incidentally it is worth mentioning here that about 150 to 200,000 Eurasians who had adopted Indonesian citizenship also felt compelled to flee to Holland – the nationalised enterprises suffered from defective management ).
For some solid information on these and other matters see L.Blusse “Report on the first Cambridge – Delhi – Leiden – Yogyakarta Conference ” Delhi, 3-5 January 1985 (online).
I should have mentioned that the earlier demarcation line was based on the armistice of October 1946. This one wasn’t respected either.
This movie gives a glimpse of life in pre-war Jakarta:
I’ll embed that
There’s also this (hope it’s not the same video just different sections), mainly Jakarta I think but also Bali, I haven’t watched through to the end, keep meaning to do a post about these videos, from University of Pennsylvania Museum of Archaeology and Anthropology (Penn Museum). How much has changed?
Patung it is a different movie, not of the same pictorial quality but a welcome addition all the same.
I directed my ire at Odinius but Ross is also rather smug as far as his opinion on the comparative merit of British colonialism is concerned.
How come that Furnivall was in despair about it and Orwell (who was in the Imperial Police in Burma) came to despise it.
In my years in the UK I got quite enough of British self-congratualation, thank you, and I am sorry to encounter it here again.
Well actually sorry dumb of me but the second video is from 1955, by Watson Kintner, as is this one, which is just “Java”.
This is also “Java” and then it switches to Ceylon at some point
Arie, Orwell is one of my favourite authors, and was one of the most honest socialists I’ve ever encountered. However, that doesn’t make his every view binding on me.
Burma is scarcely a great argument for emancipation, thouygh there are other countries that became independent and are pretty damned sound. Sri Lanak, with tis excellent attitude to terrorists, is one such.
I’m not saying we should go back and re-colonise, even were that a practical option, but it can’t be denied that numerous African states were much better off under the British Empire.
My parents’ and grandparents’ generation were proud of their ‘dominion over palm and pine,’ not because they wished the ‘natives’ ill but because they believed, correctly, that the Empire was a benevolent factor in their lives.
Ross, .apart from the fact that Sri Lanka was colonised by both the British and the Dutch, it seems to me a bit odd to refer to that country as a successful product of British colonialism. It hasn’t managed to get on top of its internal divisions and it is just emerging from a murderous civil war, in which ‘the other side’ did not just consist of a bunch of terrorists. It is arguable that its internal divisions are also due to the erstwhile British preference for Tamils.
“that numerous African states were much better off under the British Empire.”
Yes, but the elites there wouldn’t agree with you. They are better off today. This is also the case in Indonesia. The Indonesian elite, especially the ‘homines novi’ who are now in charge, is better off under its own dispensation than it would have been under the Dutch. It is quite a different story as far as ordinary Indonesians are concerned. They were better governed before the war. The rule of law was firmly established, there was greater respect for human rights and there was virtually no corruption. It was on the whole a well ordered society, as Holland itself was and is. The elite version of history would of course never acknowledge that.
Pre-war Indonesia suffered, to be sure, from the internal contradiction that on the one hand there was a theoretical acknowledgement of merit, as for instance shown in educational qualifications, but that on the other hand there was a colour bar to the higher positions. There was not enough scope for an up and coming Indonesian educational elite and it was from its ranks that the nationalist leaders were recruited (Sukarno, Hatta and Sjahrir are the prime examples here).
Raymond Kennedy has rightly said that education is dynamite for a colonial system.
However, the picture now presented by the Indonesian elite of the colonial period (of which movies such as ‘Merah Putih’ are popular versions) is largely mendacious but yet widely accepted by foreign ‘observers’ who have no access to the primary sources.
Oh! I misinterpreted your sentiments. Empires were not so bad, after all. Though the more modern ones, China’s and the Soviets, were awful, indeed.
Empires are always, at some point, viewed as terrible by the people who lack access to the center.
…and there’s the rub. Despite a lot of talk at home about Rights of Man, liberty and so own, none of the colonial empires allowed colonized “natives” to vote in their parliaments, or granted full citizenship on par with what the white colonizers enjoyed. The problem, of course, with using the language of liberty and rights is that, eventually, people want it to become more than just window dressing. Given that circumstance, it’s inevitable that those left out would want to skim the top layer off the cake and start anew.
Most of the time, this just entailed a new top layer forming, with a new set of exploiters. Typically these were the same elites cultivated by the colonialists to be their yes men. But at least these fellows could represent themselves as representative, and by doing so, make people feel as if the new states were “theirs.”
Probably right. Perhaps the argument I have often put forward, that rajas, here, or rajahs, in India, or tribal chiefs in Africa, were a better idea than half-baked intellectuals as inheritors of authority when we withdrew.

If you mean Aussie and Canada, those two countries turned out pretty well
Yup, the near-extermination and marginalization of the indigenous peoples are minor not-worthy-to-mention hick-ups in the success stories that Australia and Canada are. These groups are now very successful at serving as tourist attractions.
Pre-White North America and Australia were not exactly paradisical
Paradisical as in the glorious 20th century, the age of genocides?
We cannot turn back the time but looking at the cost of lives and misery caused to local peoples one cannot seriously view colonialism as something positive.
Arie Brand
1948 the Republic acknowledged the line that the Dutch army had reached in the first ‘agresi militer’ as demarcation line and bound itself to no longer infiltrate Dutch occupied territory. This was an empty promise.
Pangeran Diponegoro, does there ring a bell? Empty promises, the Dutch virtually invented it and the Indonesians learned from their former masters. Too bad the current leadership is still full of it. It’s time for Indonesia to ditch that “Dutch treat”.
Odinius for once I agree with you. However, as far as Indonesia is concerned the elite that took over in the “national revolution” did not consist of the former yes men of the Dutch. Most of them had been imprisoned or exiled at one stage or another. If the former ‘yes men’, that is the traditional elite with at the top the Javanese aristocracy, had retained its position for a while there would have been greater institutional continuity.
Apart from the inbuilt contradiction about educating an elite and then maintaining a colour bar (to a certain extent) there is , for societies that are democratic at home, a far more serious inbuilt contradiction: they can never create a democracy in their colonies. The reason being of course that the ultimate political sanction in a democracy is to send the government of the day packing. If that happened in a colony the colonial situation would come to an end. Various surrogates have been thought of. One could have a ‘consultative council’ at the top (in Indonesia de “Volksraad”) and democracy of a sort at lower levels (“Regentschapsraden” en “gemeenteraden”- councils at the level of the kabupaten and cities and towns). But these remained surrogates for the full thing.
In the Philippines Rizal was speaking at one stage (in a letter to Blumentritt) of Filipino representation in the Spanish parliament, such as it was then. But if that had been done on a proportional basis Filipino representatives would by now outnumber the Spanish ones by almost 3 to 1. The situation would even have been more unbalanced in Dutch parliament. This kind of ‘solution’ is only feasible with small populations. France has it for some of its remaining overseas territories, I think.
In short a colony is an impossible thing for a democracy.
This all is not to suggest that the Indonesian ‘new elite’, apart from being hungry for its own place in the sun, was universally so for democracy. Sukarno, at least, abolished it at the first opportunity he had, to replace it with ‘guided democracy”(‘demokrasi dipimpin’) – a euphemism for authoritarianism
Laredion, Pangeran Dipo Negoro huh? I have a story to tell here. Many years ago I went to Magelang to see for myself the stage where it all took place. As it happened there was an Indonesian teacher there with a group of students whom he gave the full low down on the betrayal by that Dutch sabre dragger. Since I was the only foreigner there some moments later he approached me and asked where I came from. I said prudently Australia, which was the literal truth (moreover I did not only come from there – I am Australian by nationality). He found out soon enough that I am of Dutch origin, however, and to my surprise he started to reminisce happily about his youth in colonial times. He still knew the names of all his Dutch teachers. Here was an Indonesian, so I thought, who didn’t judge the situation in his own youth by what happened a century before. Many contemporary Indonesians, who often only know about the colonial situation through propaganda in the style of “Merah Putih”, have however a very odd sense of chronology. If one judged democracy in Britain in the 1930’s, say, by the situation that prevailed before the Reform Bill, more than a hundred years earlier, people would think you to have a bizarre sense of history. But Indonesians do that all the time when they judge the colonial situation. They come up with seventeenth century examples, for instance, to argue how awful it all was. Well, things were awful in most countries then.
And if you think that the Javanese had to learn the concept and practice of betrayal from the Dutch you have never looked seriously at earlier Javanese history.
Unfortunately, when in the relations between civilised states a certain modicum of good faith had become fairly common it remained a very rare article on the Indonesian side. Sukarno was notorious for entering into an agreement of some sort or other with the firm purpose not to stick to it. The last flagrant one in this category was the Bunker Agreement of August 1962 between Indonesia and the Netherlands re Papua. Even though this provided, among other things, for a plebiscite on self determination in Papua it not only became clear pretty soon that Sukarno did not intend to stick to this but that he had not intended to do so at the very moment Indonesia entered into it (Suharto later understood that it was more profitable to have a fraudulent plebiscite than no plebiscite at all). See for this whole saga my thirteen part series on Australian Webdiary (the first Google entry under my name).
Every nation creates its own national myth and in that regard Indonesia is no different from Holland which also paints a collective history of itself that can often be picked apart quite easily, the same can be said for Britain or France or any other nation.
The Republicans won the Indonesian War of Independence, whether they actually achieved any significant military victory over the Dutch is irrelevant; the Dutch left, Sukharno’s Republic was established and according to the famous dictum the victors get to write the history.
Had the Dutch successfully defeated the Republicans then today we would read about how the Federation of Indonesia (minus Papua) successfully thwarted an early attempt by former Japanese collaborators to establish a Javanese-centric dictatorship over all the Indies but thankfully due to the loyalty of many Indonesians and the gallant police-keeping duties of the Dutch Army a peaceful federal union was created instead (think of Malaysia and the defeat of the Communist insurgency in the 1950’s).
Whether you think Indonesia would have been a better place had the Republicans failed is a matter for one of those tedious historical “what if?” discussions, the Republic won and for better or for worse this is the Indonesia we now have. It ill behoves a national (or former national) of the ex-colonial power to tell them how wrong they are, it deserves the same reception as would be accorded to an Englishman in certain bars I know in Ireland if he were to tell them that their independent Irish Republic was a failure and they should have listened to the British instead.
That famous dictum that ‘the victors get to write the history’ is a description of a sorry situation, not a prescription. Genuine historians try to follow the prescription i.e. to dig out the facts wherever they lead them. Unfortunately, this type of historian is, I think, pretty rare in Indonesia . And most certainly never to be found among the folk that are repsonsible for composing an epos like ‘merah putih’.
“It ill behoves a national (or former national) of the ex-colonial power to tell them how wrong they are,” I beg to disagree. It is such nationals who are most keenly aware of the discrepancy between the dreams that some of their progressive countrymen in the thirties and even in the forties believed in (that of a free, independent, democratic and progressive Indonesia) and the god awful place it has been for most of the time since independence.
I was first tutored in things Indonesian at the University of Amsterdam by the late Professor W.F.Wertheim. Before the war he was a professor at the School of Law in Jakarta and there he started to share that dream. Back in Holland after the war he became a vociferous advocate for Indonesian independence. But later he became an even more vociferous critic of the Suharto regime and an advocate for the many tapol rotting away in Buru.
Why should he have shut up because he happened to be a Dutch citizen? He knew at first hand that the situation in the last decades of the colonial regime was a hell of a lot better for ordinary Indonesians than it was under the Suharto regime. But even if it had not been that he would still have spoken out. And rightly so.
I know at first hand that the situation in Papua under that ‘repressive colonial’ government of ours was infinitely better for ordinary Papuans than it has become since that much heralded ‘pembebasan’ – after which they got to know real repression.
If you attempted to shut me up with your references to those ‘bars in Ireland’ you have failed. Unfortunately for you you don’t have the means at your command that are generally available there. What would you have preferred, a broken glass or a broken bottle?
And hey, Berlian Biru, just as an afterthought: have you thought of the implications of your taboo on critique by nationals of former colonial powers, such as the British, in other situations than those Irish bars you seem to be so familiar with? A Briton has, from your point of view, to keep mum about almost any foreign situation because chances are that at one time or another his country was involved in a colonial government there. Perhaps you should send Blair an email next time he opens his mouth about Mugabe. I bet he prefers it above a broken bottle in his face.

And if you think that the Javanese had to learn the concept and practice of betrayal from the Dutch you have never looked seriously at earlier Javanese history.
Duuh, really? How old are you? My point was to show that empty promises and betrayal are perfect examples of normal human behaviour, not limited to any particular group, anywhere in the world. In the era of colonialism the Europeans (the Dutch included) took it to another level.
Arie, in August 17th 1945 Ahmad Sukarno and Mohammed Hatta declared the independence of Indonesia, they declared that Indonesia was one united republic under the Red and White flag and consisted of all the territory formerly under Dutch control. The Dutch who had been unceremoniously kicked out of their former colonial territory three and a half years earlier disputed this claim, they even went so far as to send armed forces back into Indonesia to fight the Republicans, kill them and try to destroy the Republic.
The Dutch failed, they lost, they were beaten, the rest is history.
I am sorry about my allusion to Irish bars, that was uncalled for, you are of course perfectly entitled to express your viewpoint without fear of violence but nonetheless the point remains; Indonesia is an independent nation now. The Dutch, whether they were quite progressive rulers in the dying decades of their empire or not, were never entitled to be in the country in the first place and if they had been the marvellous, beneficent rulers that you paint them to be then they would either still be here or would have left some form of tangible impression on the newly independent state. The fact that they utterly failed to do so speaks volumes about how the natives of Indonesia viewed Dutch imperial pretensions.
Tony Blair is perfectly correct to criticise the rule of Mugabe, but he does so on the basis that Zimbabwe is an independent state and should be treated as such, the minute Blair or any other Briton says to Mugabe “you should listen to us because when we ran your country we did so much better” (which is your attitude) Mugabe, the people of Zimbabwe and indeed the rest of the world would resoundingly tell Blair to shove his opinions up the Zambesi.
The Dutch are gone, they should never have been here, but we can’t turn back the clock, why you insist in doing so I fail to understand, maybe Indonesia would have been a better country without Sukarno and maybe if my auntie had testicles she’d be my uncle, but we are where we are now and post colonial schadenfreude on the part of apologists for Dutch imperialism has a distinctly unpleasant aroma about it.
The Dutch lost, Sukarno won, try to get over it, it was nearly seventy years ago after all.
The Red Indians lived in Canada for thousands of years, The Aborigines in Australia for as long if not longer. What did they do with the immense potential of those huge areas.
My kin arrived a couple of hundred years ago and both countries are now vast and vital countries.
I don’t feel we have anything to apologise for. They were all busy warring down each other – we hardly introduced conflict, merely were, by virtue of technology, better at it.
And for the record, I always liked Indians. One of my fave photos from childhood was me with two braves in full regalia on the Hamilton Ontario Orange Walk.Before you put your bills or letters in the mail tomorrow a reminder that the price for first class stamps went up to 46 cents.

Hey, I’m Nick!
Manchester, England, United Kingdom · Member since February 2012
Software Architect from Manchester.
Nick (and Florence) was a really great guest and very respectful of my place. They were good communicators before they arrived and 'easy to please' once they were here in the best way in that they got to grips with everything really fast and just got on with living in the flat. They made themselves at home in the best possible sense and left the place nice and clean upon my return.Background Information:
A clause is a group of words within a sentence that includes a subject and a verb. A phrase is a group of related words within a sentence that does not have both a subject and a verb. Embedding is when a phrase or sentence becomes part of another sentence, serving key grammatical functions (Owens, pg 329).
Clauses and phrases are the most advanced method of language sophistication known to man. With them, a sentence can theoretically be made to communicate anything that can be thought (Pinker, 1995). The existence of clauses and phrases manages to both greatly enrich our communication possibilities while often making effective communication more difficult. Expanded sentences are commonly understood as those which include additional information, such as modifiers or negation, but are not as sophisticated as sentences with clauses or phrases.
Because complexity is increased by adding words within and near clauses and phrases, and because of the difficulty in comparing order of acquisition across categories (e.g. negatives, pronouns, etc.), clause and phrase hierarchies should be manipulated based on the individual needs of the student. A student with difficulty understanding negatives should work on clauses and phrases that include negatives.
We call clauses that are missing words elliptical clauses. For example, “The boy I met was named Fred.” instead of “The boy that I met was named Fred.” Elliptical clauses are common, and especially in oral speech, are often easier to understand. Compound and complex sentences occur when sentences combine independent and/or dependent clauses. Complex sentences are often used to show that one idea takes precedence over another. Compound sentences are often used to show that two ideas are of equal importance. While nearly all assessments contain directions with at least some clauses and phrases, the PLS, CASL, CELF, and OWLS are among the assessments that directly assess production of these structures.
Prerequisites: relative pronouns (that, which, who, what) for relative clauses; specific structures for others (nouns for noun phrases, infinitives for infinitive phrases, prepositions for prepositional phrases, etc.)

I love the sentence wheeels! Will be sharing them with teachers in my school here in the Caribbean.
Pingback: Welcome to Free Language Stuff! « Free Language Stuff
Great worksheets. Very user friendly, great composition (not crowded) and a variety of ideas. A real good site.
What great worksheets… what fun!!
Outstanding!! Thank you soo much for all your hard work! You ROCK!!
Love the hierarchy model! However, “after school” is a prepositional phrase, not a dependent clause. A phrase does not build complexity into the sentence structure. The example “She opened her backpack after school” is a simple sentence. Phrases do not create complex sentences. In order to be complex, the sentence must contain at least one dependent clause and an independent clause.
Are there any answers to these worksheets?
No, sorry, for the most part I haven’t had time to do answer sheets.
Thank you your pages give me lots of ideas on workstations that can be used throughout the year, thanks!
These are perfect for my middle school kids who are working on compound and complex sentence structures. Thank you!!

The new flavors will be sold in limited batches, only 500 such batches will be sold. If you're among the few lucky souls to buy such a batch, you can take part in the voting.
The five flavors up for vote are:
Spicy Mary: A smoky, spicy tomato vinegar base gives this bloody mary-inspired chip its kick. Hints of pickled veggies and spices like black and red pepper, ginger, and allspice make your mouth tingle, while crisp celery notes leave a fresh finish.
Dirty Martini: A gin-lover's dream come true, the refined flavor of the Dirty Martini chip comes from a mix of subtle herbal notes, including juniper, and a strong olive flavor.
Creamy Caesar Krinkle Cut: This chip combines everything we love about a Caesar salad (minus the anchovies) to create a classic. Garlic and green onion give this flavor its personality while smooth buttermilk and parmesan cheese make for a creamy finish.
Tuscan Three Cheese Krinkle Cut: Reminiscent of the classic Italian favorite, bruschetta, this flavor combines sweet and tangy roasted pepper and tomato with creamy aged goat and Romano cheeses. Ciao Bella!
Buffalo Bleu Cheese Krinkle Cut: Based on the classic bar food favorite, buffalo wings with bleu cheese dressing, this robustly-flavored chip tastes like the original -- no bones about it! The zesty and smoky tomato base adds heat, making this chip spicy at the first crunch. A smooth finish of celery and creamy bleu cheese flavors cools things down.

Hi Steve, thanks so much for mentioning the People's Choice promotion! I wanted to clarify a couple of things in your post that are a bit confusing. First, anyone can vote online at, not just the people who try our Party Pack. Second, we created only 500 Party Packs so that people could actually try each of the five flavors before they vote online. But once the polls close on March 31, only ONE of those five flavors will actually be produced--the one that gets the highest ratings. The new flavor will be added to our existing line up of chips. Hope that helps!If you are in Colorado this Thursday (October 11, 2007), I encourage you to register and attend DEMOgala 2007.

Apparently, nothing can come between Sofía Vergara and Joe Manganiello ... not even pizza.
A day after the two celebrated the Modern Family actress' 42nd birthday in Malibu with friends, the lovebirds were spotted together again, this time on a solo date—a late one. The two, who are in the "early stages of dating," were seen entering Soho House in West Hollywood around 10 p.m. on Friday, E! News has learned.
And what could possibly make a date better than getting to stare at either Vergara or Manganiello? Pizza, of course. And the gorgeous stars were so into each other that they even paused in between bites of their delicious, cheesy dinner to kiss, a witness told E! News.
PHOTOS: Sofia Vergara and Joe Manganiello are dating ... and are already hotter than these 5 couples
Vergara and the 37-year-old True Blood star enjoyed their delicious, intimate dinner in a cozy booth and couldn't keep their hands off each other. They sat close together and at one point, Vergara snuggled into the nook of the actor's arm as he wrapped it around her shoulders.
The two were heard giggling and making jokes. At one point, Manganiello started waving his arms around while telling one, spurring the actress, whose Modern Family character is known for being hilariously vocal, to throw her head back and laugh out loud.
The actor looked pretty enamored with Vergara, the witness said. The pair's chemistry was electric! The two seemed as though they were in their own world and only had eyes for each other.
Their date was interrupted briefly by two of Vergara's friends, younger men. They greeted the couple and she seemed happy to see them, although the actor appeared reserved during the encounter, the witness said. Can you blame him?

The brain probably does not interpret this statement and automatically think “chiropractic.” Most often it is associated with “cracking the back” to “get rid of back pain.” One might ask, “How is chiropractic related to expressing my authentic self?” What if the body had the capacity to better connect to the internal wisdom and gain a greater understanding of who one is?
And how can one gain access to this? It’s a simple lesson in wiring….
Once upon a time, humans had to run away from big scary creatures or fight in combat with the neighboring tribe. The physiology developed to support humans in these situations to ensure the survival of the human race. Any perceived lack of safety engaged defense physiology. Fast-forward to today, and we are still hard-wired to have defense patterns but are now faced with more modern struggles. Paying the bills, chemical overload, and confronting feelings of worthlessness are all perceived ways in which one may feel life is threatened.
If life is perceived as threatened, there is a disconnection from the full experience. For instance, in the moment a car accident occurs, there is tremendous activity. The quantity of information is too much for the brain to process at that time. In that moment, the brain is only focused on what is needed to survive the event. Blood supply is diminished from the frontal lobe, the portion of the brain responsible for complex thinking, and the immediate focus is not on the bigger questions in life. When focused on survival, the body goes into defense physiology, and the more primitive parts of the brain are predominately in control of one’s experience, body, and life. This works incredibly well for a short-term strategy to preserve life but will not work efficiently to sustain life — let alone maximize human potential. If one remains in this state, there is no choice but to live life in reaction, protection, and defense.
Eventually the strategy to disconnect no longer serves, as the capacity for healing becomes reduced. The ability to “find” the body efficiently is lost; if it cannot be found, it cannot be fixed. This becomes quite apparent to most people when physical pain manifests. Fortunately, this pain is a great opportunity to reconnect to the experience and reprocess and integrate the information that was not processed initially.
Here enters the concept of Reorganizational Healing introduced by Dr. Donald Epstein, D.C.
Reorganizational Healing seeks to create a more efficient, highly organized system within an individual through connecting to a symptom. In contrast, Restorative Therapeutics, such as taking a pill to get rid of a headache, looks to reduce or eliminate a symptom without extracting the deeper meaning behind it. The individual resumes life as it was before without discovering the meaning behind the pain. An application of Reorganizational Healing is Network Spinal Analysis, the chiropractic technique developed by Epstein, which works to advance spinal and neural integrity and develop new levels of self-organization within the individual. These developed neurological strategies will create wellness in all fronts: body, mind and spirit. The patient will become more aware of his body, breath, and energy and grow out of defense into safety where the frontal lobe can then better function and allow oneself to ask the bigger questions in life.
Some tips on staying connected and avoiding defense physiology:
- Follow the organic process of experience. First become aware of your experience as is without judgment. Acknowledge any awareness you have. Accept the experience and what has been acknowledged without the desire to end or change it.
- Utilize your pain as your “check engine” light. Your pain is your opportunity. It is a perfect time to stop and pay attention to what is really going on. Once you have done this, you can take inventory and, if needed, change what you are doing.
- Practice listening to your body. To help you better understand the story of your pain, a great daily habit is to take a few moments to bring your awareness to your body through your own touch and breath.May 22, 2015
Who needs a pet hampster in the classroom when you can have live clams?
Students at Perry Primary School are participating in a unique project to try and raise clams in a salt water aquarium.
"Last year, Ms. Hagberg and I wanted to come up with a way to improve education of science out here. Brainstorming we came up with, we decided what we'd like to do is start an aquaculture program being,” says Jack Palaio Perry Primary Special Ed. Teacher.
Because Perry is in a coastal area, teachers say they hope the kindergarten through second grade students will learn about aquaculture as an occupation and develop an appreciation for marine sea life.
"Starting out small, learning about different things that go on in our community. We think it's real important, living on the nature coast for the children to be able to experience and have hands on opportunities to see how clams grow and develop,” explains Cathy Hagberg, Perry Primary School Science teacher.
Students seem to be learning already.
"She was telling us about the clams. She put them in the water and spread them out so they wouldn't get close together,” says first grader Pallis.
If class participation on the first day is any indication, teachers won't have to worry about these little scientists "clamming" up any time soon.
The clam growing project is funded by the JB Butler Science grant.
The clams were donated.The West Valley Outdoor Learning Center has a hawk and owl sanctuary. The hawk and owl sanctuary is home to permanently injured native birds of prey.
These birds could not survive on their own in the wild. The rest of their lives will be spent educating students and the public about their role in the environment. Students and the public will gain excitement and understanding of these amazing birds by seeing them up close.
The birds are cared for and trained by licensed rehabilitor and handler Jami Ostby Marsh. Dr. Ponti and Marlyn Olmor also provide crucial support for the hawk and owl sanctuary.
The building was provided by Ziggler Building Supplies and built by Inland Northwest Wildlife Council volunteers. With out these contributions this great education tool would not be possible.
The mission for the center is to put a purpose to a life of an animal that would otherwise be euthanized, through education. The birds will live a long happy life, and will be cared for in the best possible way.
Our sanctuary has been expanded to include an outdoor eagle mew for our Bald Eagle, Aqui. The new mew was built by Ryan Van Tine and a few very helpful and dedicated volunteers. Aqui is happy to be in his new home and has become a great ambassador for the conservation of his species.
If you are interested in volunteering or having the birds visit your group please contact us here.
Squeakers is a saw-whet owl who came to us with a wing injury, which left her unable to fly. Although she is small she is mighty. She is one of our feistiest raptors here at the center. What ever you do don't call her a baby owl! She is full grown, and proud!
Tilt, is a western screech owl who joined our crew in 2004. Tilt has a head injury which has left his vision impared. He is named Tilt because of the way he tilts when he looks at his visitors in the classroom. Like his friend Squeakers, Tilt is also a full grown owl.
Grey is a Barred Owl who came to the center in 2005. Grey has a head injury which has left him with behaviors that are not typical of wild owls, so he is unable to survive on his own in the wild. Grey is a very popular education bird and loves "performing" for audiences of all ages
Aqui is a Bald Eagle who joined as a juvenile in 2004. Aqui had a wing injury and was unable to care for himself in the wild. He is getting ready for his big move into a new outdoor mew which will take place later this summer.
Willie the barn owl was donated to us from Washington State University. She came to their hospital with an injured eye. The doctors aren't sure what happened to her eye but unfortunately they had to remove it. Since owls need both eyes to hunt their prey Willie probably wouldn't be able to survive in the wild so she lives in the sanctuary and likes to visit school groups.

Pantelones is a rough legged hawk and her name in Spanish means pants. She has this name because of the feathers on her legs down to her talons. You can see that her roommate Kiwi, a red tailed hawk, doesn't have feathers on her legs. Pantalones lives in more artic climates and visits our neighborhoods in the wintertime. Pants, as we call her, was donated to us by Omak Animal Hospital. Sadly she was shot in the wing and would never be able to fly again. She now is being trained to be an education bird.
For more information about rough legged hawks check out,
Albert is a female great horned owl that came to live with us in 2003. She was brought to Ponti Veterinary Hospital with a broken wing. Dr Ponti decided that Albert would never be able to fly again so he suggested that she become an education bird. She likes to eat mice, rats and rabbits.
To find out more about great horned owls please visit,
Hanovi is a great horned owl that was also donated by Ponti Veterinary Hospital. He also has a permanently injured wing. Often times owls like to eat carrion or dead animals that have been hit by cars. Since owls are built for silent flight and not speed they often times are unable to get out of the way and get hit by a car. Hanovi loves to do presentations for school groups.
For more information about great horned owls check out,
Kiwi is a red tailed hawk that came to live with us in 2004. She is from the Colville, Washington area. She was found with a damaged wing and the veterinarian wasn't sure what had happened to her. Kiwi is a very intelligent bird and she loves to eat quail. Kiwi is one of our favorite education birds because she loves to be on the glove and visit new places.

Yes, B is correct.
The reason is that in order to compare brother and "I" the two words must be in the same case -- in this instance, they must both be in subject case. The sentence is somewhat truncated. The entire thought would read like this:
"My brother knows more about technology than I do." You wouldn't say "...than me do" right?

I have gotten my fair share of all of those grades. I have had professors that have had an impact on me to the core. They have asked for a high level of scholarship, and for that I am eternally grateful. But at the same time, I now what it means to push myself, and therefore, I know what it means to push others. You can blame me or you can blame my professors. There is this academic standard that I myself am still trying to attain. I am not there myself, but I can challenge my students to become scholars.
I do want to say that academic achievement is not the only kind of intelligence in which one can excel, but if you’re going to be in the academic environment, know that you are going to be challenged academically – and if you want an A – work hard for it.
What’s the identity insight in this post? You are not your grade. Your grade does not define you. A grade is some measure for a course or your work. A grade does not define you.A Hall County woman was arrested Wednesday on charges of possessing and attempting to distribute methamphetamine and other drugs, according to the Multi-Agency Narcotics Squad.
Walita Faye Wooten, 36, was charged with possession of methamphetamine with intent to distribute, possession of alprazolam, an anti-anxiety medication, with intent to distribute and possession of marijuana, said Lt. Scott Ware, head of the squad.
Agents searched Ms. Wooten’s residence in the 5300 block of Lawson Robinson Road, Ware said, and found methamphetamine, marijuana, alprazolam tablets, packaging materials and digital scales.
The street value of the drugs seized was estimated at $1,300, Ware said.

Corsair Hydro H80, H100 series coolersTwo units of the impressive McLaren P1 supercar are being offered for sale by a dealership located in the Netherlands.
If you were looking to add the hot McLaren P1 to your garage but you’ve missed it for some reason, than you have come to the right place, because not one but two units of the McLaren P1 are currently looking for new owners. The hypercars are being sold by a dealership located in the Netherlands and one of them is finished in Supernova Silver metallic while the other has a Pearl White metallic finish. Both of them are brand new and they can be yours for 1.8 million euros, each.
The McLaren P1 is the fastest ever production supercar produced in Woking, Surrey, England, and it’s rivaling the Ferrari LaFerrari and the Porsche 918 Spyder. This is a two-door coupe rear mid-engine and rear-wheel drive layout hybrid supercar, with a 3.8 liter twin turbo V8 petrol engine under its hood, backed up by an electric motor. The assembly is producing a total of 890 HP and 978 Nm of torque. The 0 to 100 km/h acceleration is made in 2.8 seconds and top speed has been electronically limited to “just” 350 km/h (217 mph). Only 375 units of the McLaren P1 have been produced.
Sale Link 1 / Sale Link 2Today I visited the Atsuta Shrine with a friend. We wanted to visit Kami no Ondo, a shop that specialises in all kinds of paper and paper craft supplies. Since the shop is close to the Shrine we decided to visit it as well.
Atsuta Shrine is one of the important Shinto Shrines in Japan. Infact it is considered the 2nd most important shrine after the Grand Shrines of Ise in Mie Prefecture. The Shrine stands amidst tall trees in Nagoya's Atsuta Ward. The Shrine buildings are built in the Shinmei-zukuri architecture and are said to be modeled after the Grand Shrines of Ise.
Many of the shrine buildings were destroyed in the World War II bombings. The main Shrine Building, the Honden and other buildings were reconstructed in 1955.
The Atsuta Shrine enshrines the Sun Goddess Amaterasu and the Five Gods of Atsuta. The Shrine is also home to ' Kusanagi-no-Tsurugi', a sword which is one of the Three Sacred Imperial Treasures. It is believed that three treasures, Yata no Kagami (a mirror), Kusanagi no Tsurugi (a sword) and Yasakani no Magatama (a jewel) were brought to earth by Ninigi-no-Mikoto, the grandson of the Sun Goddess Amaterasu. The Japanese Imperial Family are descendants of Ninigi-no Mikoto. The three sacred treasures are considered to represent, valor, wisdom and benevolence. The Three Sacred Treasures find a mention in the Kojiki and Nihonshoki, the oldest Chronicles containing explanations about the origin of the Japanese islands and the Kami.Since these three treasures are legendary, the exact locations of these treasures are not disclosed but it is believed that the Sword is located in the Atsuta Shrine in Nagoya, the mirror is located in the Ise Grand Shrine and the jewel is located at the Imperial Palace in Tokyo. Traditionally these three sacred treasures can be seen only by the Emperor and certain priests and these treasures are presented to the Emperor at the time of his enthronement ceremony, which is a private affair.
The Treasure Hall, Bunkaden, houses about 4000 articles donated by the Imperial family, Shoguns, feudal lords and even common people. The collection contains articles like ancient documents, sacred garments, masks, furniture and even household items.
There are many halls where various ceremonies like weddings etc are conducted.
We saw few Plum blossoms on the Shrine grounds.

Harvard Business School graduate and matchmaker Rachel Greenwald recently completed a 10-year study where she talked to over 1,000 single men. This study revealed some often counter-intuitive reasons behind their dating habits, and most importantly, why they sometimes don’t call women back. JDate got a chance to sit down with Rachel and talk about her new book, WHY HE DIDN’T CALL YOU BACK: 1,000 Guys Reveal What They Really Thought About You After Your Date.
JDate: For this book, you conducted a 10-year research project with 1,000 single men to uncover the top ten reasons why they don’t call their dates back. What is the number one reason?The good news is that chivalry is not dead! A surprising 84% of men said they expect to pay for the meal, but they want to know their gesture is appreciated.
Rachel Greenwald: The number one most popular reason men don’t call back is “The Boss Lady.” This label applies when a man thinks a woman is terrific – smart, good-looking, and successful – but he decides he’d rather hire her than date her. Women often guess that men are intimidated by their great job or strong personality. But men sincerely said that’s not it. They get enough aggression at work all day – when they come home they want to be with someone softer, more nurturing. They do want someone intelligent with an interesting career, but they crave a warm demeanor.
JDate: Describe the “Exit Interview” technique you used to extract information from these 1,000 guys?
Rachel: I used a tactic I learned at Harvard Business School called “Exit Interviews” to reveal candid answers from men who had disappeared into a black hole. I called the former dates of my clients, I approached single men at Starbucks, I talked to guys at speed dating events, and I even spent six hours once in the food court at Newark Airport (during my flight delay) asking random men about their dating disconnects. During those 1,000 interviews across ten years, I never accepted glib answers like, “There was just no chemistry.” I asked “Why was there no chemistry?” I poked and prodded until I got specific details about all the little things women said and did on their dates. It turns out there are clear, consistent patterns about what turned men on, and what turned them off.
JDate: Out of your findings, which reason surprised you the most?
Rachel: One of the most surprising reasons men don’t call back is “The Never Ever Mistake.” This occurs when a woman makes an emphatic or absolute statement using words such as “I would never” or “I definitely will” or “I hate.” For example, one New York woman emphasized how much she loved living in New York by telling her date, “I’d never leave this city! My job, my family, my friends are all here!” Because he grew up on the west coast, he wasn’t sure he’d always want to stay in New York, especially after he had kids. He’d enjoyed their date together, but the next day he decided she was geographically inflexible and that she didn’t have long-term relationship potential. He took her “never ever” statement literally, even though one day she might have moved for compelling reasons, especially if they were married.
JDate: In your book you say women should never send a “thank you” email or text after a date. Why?
Rachel: Men told me that while they appreciate the post-date “Thank You Email,” it ultimately causes them to lose interest in a woman because men like the chase. They told me that when they receive your email (or text) the morning after a date, they do not think, “Oh, what good manners she has!” Rather, they think it means you like them. Turns out it’s more deflating than endearing because he wanted to contact you first and do the pursuing (assuming he liked you too). You should thank him graciously at the end of the date, but don’t steal his thunder the next day. And if you don’t hear from him at all? He’s just not that into you, of course. He’s a big boy and knows how to contact you if he wants to see you again. Your email isn’t subtle when sent under the pretext of a “thank you.”
JDate: You say in your book that women should do “the fake-purse grab” when the dinner check arrives. Can you explain?
Rachel: I conducted a national poll and asked men how they prefer women handle the awkward arrival of the dinner check on the first date. The good news is that chivalry is not dead! A surprising 84% of men said they expect to pay for the meal, but they want to know their gesture is appreciated. They don’t want to feel like the woman expects them to pay. For this reason, they prefer the “fake-purse grab” to the “blind eye.” I recommend that you reach for your purse and say sweetly, “May I contribute to this?” The vast majority of the time he will decline your offer, at which point you can thank him sincerely. If he allows you to split the bill, you probably won’t be hearing from him again (or if he does call back, it’s doubtful he’s interested in anything serious with you).
JDate: Why are there more failed first dates today than ever before?He’s a big boy and knows how to contact you if he wants to see you again. Your email isn’t subtle when sent under the pretext of a ‘thank you.’
Rachel: This is a recent and scary phenomenon. With the explosion of online dating, single men and women have the illusion of infinite options. They believe a more perfect match is just a mouse-click away. Today, people go on dates to “rule out” rather than “rule in” because they know they’ll be home in an hour, surfing the internet for someone “better.” Everyone is window shopping, but few are buying.
JDate: The case studies in your book offer hope and inspiration for the women looking for “Mr. Right.” What is the take-away for women as they read these true stories about your clients?
Rachel: My research gives women new information which empowers them to retain the men they actually want to date. By tweaking small comments and gestures they often make unknowingly, they’ll have more men pursuing them and calling back. Ultimately the woman will have the choice to accept or decline the next date, rather than waiting by the phone and wondering what happened. I truly believe it’s not that good guys aren’t out there, but rather that simple misperceptions – which can be easily fixed – are standing in Cupid’s way. Over 80% of my clients who have used this Exit Interview information (as shown in these case studies) have dramatically changed their dating results and found a wonderful guy within a few months.
JDate: The book is also a fascinating glimpse into the mind of the single man. What’s the number one thing men do like?
Rachel: The number one thing that indicated whether a woman had future-wife potential was actually rather…. um, bland! Men said they look for a woman who is a really “nice” person. Initially I assumed “nice” meant “boring,” but the anecdotes I heard turned out to be poignant. Guys remembered brief gestures or comments when a woman acted nice, kind, thoughtful, or considerate. One story that sticks out is when a guy was really impressed because his date cleaned up some sugar she spilled on the countertop at Starbucks. This small gesture really made an impact in him!
JDate: Thank you Rachel, I’m sure this advice and your book will be pretty eye-opening for our members.
Rachel: Thanks for the nice chat!
Listen up, Brides-to-be!Every bride-to-be wishes for a fairytale wedding, regardless of what her budget is. And although planning and organizing a wedding is a huge task in itself, the first step towards getting everything organized is by choosing the color scheme. Coral happens to be 2014's hottest, and most popular hue for weddings. It has a vibrant and fresh appeal that can work wonders for your wedding. With an amicable mix of various other colors, we have put together 7 unique ideas that can work with coral.
Regardless of the color scheme, don't give your guests a dress code to follow. Don't overdo it. Remember, the wedding pictures live on forever.
Regardless of the color scheme, don't give your guests a dress code to follow. Don't overdo it. Remember, the wedding pictures live on forever.
7 Coral Wedding Themes
- Coral + Gold
- Coral + Gray
- Coral + Green
- Coral + Navy Blue
- Coral + Pink
- Coral + Turquoise
- Coral + White
Coral & Gold Wedding
A postcard-style 'Save the Date' card with hints of coral and gold.
The wedding invitations are a great way to clue in your guests about the color theme.
As coral comes in various shades, make sure that you know which hue you wish to go with. This will also help you select the complementing gold hues to perfect the theme. Also, for the reception, the lighting can add a lot to the ambiance and enhance the wedding colors. Place candles along the tables that are covered with coral tablecloths; it's an excellent way to decorate the venue.
Coral & Gray Wedding
Send the card specifying the wedding date and location.
Work the color gray in such a way that it doesn't appear gloomy.
The combination of coral and gray is awe-inspiring as the subtle gray won't let the bold coral to appear too harsh. Also, rather than constricting yourself to a single shade of coral and gray, feel free to style your wedding with various shades. It will brighten up your wedding, and give it a modern touch.
Coral & Green Wedding
To reduce extra expense, email your 'Save the Date' cards to family and friends.
A simple wedding invitation with your choice of color scheme works with every budget.
From the ceremony to the reception, there are so many elements to decorate. Make sure that you have a balance between the two colors, and aren't going overboard with either of it. Remember, the ceremony lasts less than an hour. So be wise and try not to spend a lot on over-the-top decorative items. Instead, you can use other elements such as candles, flowers, etc., to bring it all together.
Don't feel stuck to the clichéd 'Save the Date' card ideas; do be creative!
Always write the names of all guests whenever possible; it's much warmer and more welcoming.
The combination of coral and navy blue is amazing for a garden wedding. These contrasting colors truly pop when paired together. For the bridesmaid dresses, even though your color scheme doesn't allow you to be flexible with the color, experiment with the necklines. Also, if you wish to add a vintage feel to your wedding, add a bit of antique gold to the centerpieces.
Coral & Pink Wedding
Formal is for wedding invitations; these cards can be as quirky as you want.
Always give credit to the hosts; traditionally speaking, the bride's parents who will pay for the wedding expenses.
Working with coral and pink can be disastrous, if you're not careful. As these hues can appear quite similar to one another, you need to know where and how much to add. So, choose the decorations wisely and sparingly as you don't want to go overboard. Let white be a neutral shade that provides balance between the two dominant colors.
Coral & Turquoise Wedding
Think outside the box; this showcases how fun a 'Save the Date' card can be.
To find customized text and colors for your invitations, seek help via online websites.
The combination is oh-so-colorful, and risky if not done correctly. Coral and turquoise not only complement one another, but vie for your attention. With subtle additions, your entire wedding décor can be uplifted to a whole new level. Rather than wearing coral or turquoise bridesmaid dresses, have them drape shawls instead. Tie satin ribbons on the top table. Hang lanterns all around the venue.
Coral & White Wedding
This 'Save the Date' card is sweet, romantic, and ticks all the check boxes.
A simple, yet elegant, wedding invitation is sometimes all that you need.
Giving coral its well-deserved space, pairing it with white can give you more room to work the theme. Setting the mood for the event, you can choose various shades of coral wedding decorations here.
Once you've finalized a color theme, stick to it and don't compromise. Begin with the wedding stationery, and work your way to other sections of the wedding. And if you really want a particular style of décor, bridesmaids dresses, or any other element, do make it a point to make it happen. This is your wedding, and you have to call the shots.Choose your preferred language. We speak English (US) and 41 other languages.

There are 3 people looking at these apartments.
“Staff was very nice. Extremely helpful with organizing tours or recommending areas to go. Pool view was awesome. Room and balcony were very large with a nice kitchenette. Was nice being away from the busyness of the old city, but still walking distance to some beaches and grocery.”
“Great location, close to main street and all nearby restaurants, shops and bars. Quiet at night which is a big bonus. All facilities especially the air con work perfectly and our host was extremely friendly and helpful.”
“Location, down behind the Pile Gate at the water front. Step out the door, round the corner an you are at a beautiful small jetty. Great staff service and well equipped apartment.”
“My friend and I were only staying for four nights so wanted to make the most of our time in Dubrovnik. We had emailed ahead to arrange a taxi transfer from the airport to the hotel - Akan arranged this and we had a fantastic quick journey to the hotel, where our driver pointed out different parts of Dubrovnik along the way. Akan the landlord was very welcoming and friendly throughout our stay. We were particularly grateful as he upgraded our room to a clean and spacious two bed apartment which looked straight out onto the beautiful view of the harbour and caught the morning sun on the balcony. Even though Villa Erna is advertised as apartments, the rooms were still cleaned on a daily basis. Overall the apartment was of a very high and very clean standard. We were also grateful to be provided with washing up liquid, cleaning sponges, toilet roll, shampoo, etc - features which are often not included when staying in holiday apartments. The pool area was small but well equipped with sun loungers - there were always plenty for all the guests to use. The surroundings were peaceful and calm and only a small walk to the very nice Copacabana beach. It was easy and cheap to catch the bus into Dubrovnik old town - 5 minutes walk to the number 6 bus, and less than a 15 minute journey to the town. We would recommend doing the walk around the city walls or going up the cable car to see some stunning views. A trip across to the island is also a must. Overall, our stay at Villa Erna was exactly what we were looking for and we had a relaxing and memorable holiday for a very reasonable price. I have already recommended Villa Erna to friends and would definitely visit again! The only thing I was I had done differently was take the payment for the apartment in cash, as it is difficult for the landlord to pick up a signal for credit cards - it is a help if you can pay cash!”
“The lady of the house was very kind and helpfull with us!”
”
“Good position in the middle of the Dubrovnik with all the necessary facilities. Really clean apartments with lot of space and the staff was very helpful”
“You can not find better apartment in oldtown Dubrovnik. You have full access to everything in the apartment include kitchen, dishwasher and Laundry machine. My girlfriend and I stay there for 5 days, it's a great place for couple. Very budget friendly and convenient for any activities in old town.”
“Everything is good. We recomend this facilitie for groups”
“A very nice and spacious apartment with a unique view over the old city and the sea. Very friendly and helpful service from the owner.”
“Location is great although we need to climb uphill from the old town to the apartment. Great value because room was big, clean with good kitchen and bathroom facilities. Wifi was excellent. Host lives upstairs and very helpful with directions. Gave us a welcoming bottle of dessert wine. A grocery store close by.”

HUNTINGTON -- The Huntington Museum of Art knows our fair city was founded and still chugs along strongly in its love of trains.
In fact, there are "Tracks" now laid through the heart of the museum.
Opened Nov. 3, the exhibit .
"Tracks" is celebrated at 7 p.m. Tuesday, Nov. 27, during the Fourth Tuesday Tour that features a guided tour of the exhibit and an appearance by author and local historian James E. Casto portraying Collis P. Huntington. A free reception follows.
Costumed as Collis P. Huntington, the famed rail tycoon who founded Huntington, Casto frequently appears at civic clubs, schools and other groups in a first-person program that offers a glimpse of Huntington's life and times. Casto was a reporter and editor at The Herald-Dispatch for more than 40 years before his retirement in 2004. He's the author of a number of books on local and regional history.
Free Tuesdays at the Huntington Museum of Art are sponsored by AT&T.
Organized and circulated by George Eastman House International Museum of Photography and Film, Rochester, N.Y., the exhibit was previously on tour, however, senior curator Jenine Culligan said that the museum was already booked when it was touring nationally just a few years ago.
Because of Huntington's continual strong ties to the railroad, Culligan said they worked to get the exhibit to Huntington, where it will be housed through Jan. 27, 2013.
Culligan said the museum, which has had in years past several rail-themed exhibits, was due for a great show such as this photographic survey of train history that is packed with dramatic places and people.
This survey of images runs from the 1850s up through 2006 of everything from scenery and train wrecks to workers and famous trains that have made a mark on history.
Culligan said each photographer's style and subject draw you in.
Photographers such as Aaron Siskind and Lewis W. Hine documented workers back in the 1930s and 1940s.
Siskind captured the life of the "Pullman Porters," while Hine's work, "Railroad Workers and Rail Photos," from 1925, was a step behind the sooted scenes of the train into the work of the steam boiler operators, the trackwalkers, the wheel grinders, the car waiters and the switch operators.
Many of the early train photos show trains taking people where they could have never gone before without great difficulty from 1865 snow galleries near Crested Peak in Nevada and the canyons of Grand River in Utah to Henri-Cartier-Bresson's work, "Caravan on Rails" from 1961, a Time Life picture from a Mongolian desert showing how the rail had replaced the camel caravan of Marco Polo's days.
"They wanted to show how much photography and trains had changed life," Culligan said of why the exhibit was organized by the Eastman House. "They were both invented about the same time, and they were not just in America but in lives in general around the world these two innovations kind of did bring people into a modern era. Trains made traveling so much easier, and photography allowed people to be able to capture real moments of life."
The exhibit shows how the two were married together in such promotional pieces as the Carleton Watkins' stereograph series of prints showing the grandeur of Pullman's Palace cars as well as a 1926 Kodak ad saying "Take a Brownie With You," showing a woman on a train with her camera on her lap.
The exhibit shows also how photographers have been there throughout rail history to capture the good, the bad and the ugly.
A C.R. Savage shot from 1869 shows the historic connecting of the Union Pacific and the Central Pacific Railroads on Promontory Point in Utah on May 10.
While Paul Fusco captures the 1968 funeral train of Bobby Kennedy as it rolled past emotional crowds across America.
The exhibit also features a 51-photo book by Candace Plummer Gaudiani, whose 2006 work, "Forty Eight States," is a series of black and white colophon cards depicting trains, train yards and scenery throughout America.
"It's nice to work with the George Eastman House and in particularly this show because it will draw in photography buffs, train buffs and history buffs," Culligan said. "All will be interested in this show."

The German was able to hold off home driver Fernando Alonso in his Ferrari and his team mate Mark Webber. As is quite common here at Valencia, the weather is great at the start of the Grand Prix. No clouds to be seen and the track temperature already high at 47°C. As the 5 red lights went out, the Red Bull keeps their leading positions. Massa made agreat start, initially tried to take the inside of Webber but saw Alonso come back through the outside of turn 1. The Spaniard had a rather clumsy start but took back the lost places before turn 2. Massa then settled in 4th, ahead of Lewis Hamilton. Nico Rosberg takes 6th, Button 7th, Schumacher 8th. Vitaly Petrov had a miserable start and dropped to P15. Pastor Maldonado also lost considerable places and is down to 22nd. After 5 laps, Vettel has a 2 second lead over Webber who is another second ahead of Alonso. Button, who was stuck behind Rosberg since the start of the race managed to get past the Mercedes GP driver into turn 1 after using all of his KERS in the final section of lap 5. On lap 11 Fernando Alonso has slightly closed down the gap to Webber and by enough of a margin to get into the DRS zone. That enables Alonso to post quick second sector times as none of the other front runners have DRS available. That same lap, the first pitstops are starting to take place. Heidfeld, Barrichello and Kobayashi are the first to make a stop. At the end of lap 14 Webber pits and takes another set of options. Vettel had several moments already, showing how the rear tyres are nearly at their end of their life. Lewis Hamilton made a stop at the same time as he was unable to keep up with the pace of the leaders. Vettel and Alonso pitted on lap 15, just like Button and Schumacher. The latter had just been passed by Lewis Hamilton, posting a fastest lap on his brand new option tyres. One lap later Schumacher is in the pits again for a new front wing. Just as he left the pitlane on the previous lap he saw Petrov cutting the corner and clipping his front wing. After the change, Schumacher returned to the track in 22nd position and is unlikely to get into the points at this event. Once again, an early stop shows beneficial. Lewis Hamilton is now in 4th, gaining a place on Felipe Massa who pitted 2 laps later than he did. Alonso is still behind Webber but is extremely close, all the time less than 0.7s behind the Australian. One lap later Webber finally succumbs to the pressure and sees Alonso fly by at the end of the first DRS zone. Sergio Pérez meanwhile is trying a long first stint. By lap 26, nearly halfway through the event he is still on his first set of tyres. He is a massive 5 seconds off the pace. After getting passed by Petrov and Kobayashi he then makes his first stop. Meanwhile at the front, Sebastian Vettel puts in the fastest lap of the race. He must have gotten word of Alonso closing in on him, so he had to react before the Spaniard came close to the DRS window. After lap 25, Vettel is 3.2s ahead of Alonso, 1.6 more on Webber and then a gap of 12 seconds to Massa. Lewis Hamilton fell back from 4th to 6th as he already made a second stop on lap 23. On lap 28 Webber stops for the second time as well. He too will be trying to take advantage of the undercut on Alonso. Alonso pits one lap later and loses his place again to Webber. Another lap later, Vettel pits and leaves the pits just ahead of Massa. That leaves the running order now Vettel, Massa, Webber and Alonso. Massa did however pit another lap later without really interfering with the battle as Webber easily got past him thanks to his much fresher tyres. On lap 33 Button is now complaining that his KERS is not working anymore. The Englishman is now running in 6th place, 37s off the lead and 5 seconds behild Felipe Massa. In lap 43, with just 15 left to go, Hamilton makes his presumably last stop and switches to the medium tyres. Webber does the same in what is a rather strange pit entry. He was completely out of shape and ovesteery before entering the pitlane. It almost looked like he was just unable to make the corner and eventually decided to make a stop. Alonso does 2 laps longer on the softer options and rejoins the track in the middle of a pack of cars, but still ahead of Mark Webber. After all front runners completed their stops, Vettel is still in the lead, 8.7s ahead of Alonso. Webber is 3 seconds down on the Ferrari after outbraking himself. Lewis Hamilton is 30s down on Webber, with Massa a further 7 seconds down. While positions at the front seem rather fixed, Paul Di Resta is putting up a fight in the last number of laps to try and get Sebastian Buemi. His apparently too short 7th gear looks to hamper his progress there, as top speed isn't higher for him, even with the DRS open.

Harris County Sheriff's Department investigators are looking for a man, said to be 30 to 35 years old, who they believe abducted a five-year-old girl from the Fairbanks Library, 7122 North Gessner.
Authorities are asking for the public's help in finding the man who offered the girl candy to come with him around 5:30 p.m. Tuesday, October 30.
Shortly after the family reported the girl missing and were giving details to HCSO deputies, a Houston Police Department officer drove up with the girl in his car, investigators said.
According to the deputies' report:
The officer stated he had received a call to respond to a female toddler left in a parking lot at the 10100 block of Tanner Road ,less than two miles from the library. A business owner found the child standing alone in the parking lot across from his business.
Deputies interviewed the child and were told, that she had been approached by a Hispanic male between the ages of 30 to 35 years old, average build weighing around 180 lbs. with a protruding stomach. The male is described as 5'4 to 5'5 in height, wearing a black Chicago Bulls baseball hat and a dark colored workout jumpsuit or jogging suit. He asked her if she wanted some candy and to follow him to where he had more candy. The suspect then led the toddler to a dark colored, possibly brown, sedan and drove off with the child. He then let her out at the Tanner Road location. The toddler was later transported to Texas Children's Hospital for an evaluation.
If anyone has information on this male suspect in the library yesterday around 5:30 to 5:45 p.m., please call the Harris County Sheriff's Homicide unit at 713-967-5810 or Crime Stoppers at 713-222-TIPS (8477)

Houston, TX 770Reds rally to beat Braves
By Ed Shepherd
SPORTS CORRESPONDENT
A nice little rally, off a 2-0 deficit after half an inning of play, helped the Reds come back and defeat the Braves, 14-2, in a 10-run-rule championship game of the South Highline National Little League End Of Season tournament for the Minors division at Normandy Park City Hall Sunday.
The Reds, who finished with a league best 16-5 record, move on to play in the Tournament of Champions that South Highline National hosts starting June 13.
Maybe the nice little rally happened for a reason and these 9-10 year old boys for the Reds were already knowing and believing in themselves to erase that deficit, and, quickly.
"We preach to the whole team, it's a long game, don't let an error or getting behind in the game get them down. It's a long game, they can battle through it," said Reds manager Chad Parker.
First off the Braves made noise, scoring two runs on two hits as Owen McLean singled and Tristen Trujillo walked and scored on a sacrifice fly to make it 1-0 for the Braves. Then, Ian Ritter's RBI single made it 2-0 Braves after the first inning completed.
Showing immediate moxy, the Reds came back in the bottom of the first inning with five runs on three hits and two of the hits were home runs.
Saverio De Simone singled a looping ball to right field, dropping in front of the fielder before Ronan Bishop singled a hard bouncing shot up the middle. Runners were at the corners but where they were on the bases. It didn't matter as Sean McLaughlin launched the ball over the right fielder's head and the ball kept rolling all the way to the fence, which was far enough for McLaughlin to round first, second, third and home before the ball was relayed in. That gave the Reds a 3-2 lead.
"I missed hitting it out, I wished I had," said McLaughlin.
The Braves would not see things get any easier for themselves as the next batter, Cole Fenton, benefited when the ball got under the second baseman's glove and into center field.
Then Mason Hayes hit the ball to third, routinely, but the ball was thrown past the first baseman and then trying to get Hayes rounding second and heading to third with a throw, the ball was thrown past the third baseman. Hayes went home. One runner was on base, so that throwing around of the baseball led to a 5-2 lead for the Reds.
"When you're nervous you can throw the ball around, be over-excited," said Parker, who admitted his team could do that themselves and has done that same thing in games this past season.
"On average, in a Minors game during the season, there can be six to eight errors," said Parker.
Beside errors, walks also did in the Braves in this game as the next inning, they helped lead to a few more runs for the Reds, who led 10-2 after the bottom of the second inning was completed.
"We emphasize to the kids that if they make a mistake don't worry about it, let it go, and keep on playing," said Parker. "Don't compound it so you make more mistakes after the first one."
Tate Parker, one of two sons on the team for Chad, whose other son is the youngest member of the squad, knew his kid would not be shaken by the Braves early hitting of his pitching.
"Tate's been through it, he knows how to handle it," said Parker. Tate threw a four-hitter and two of the four hits came in the first inning. He also struck out six and only allowed one walk.
McLaughlin leads his team in batting average, and, power, hitting around .600 for the season but it's not average that Parker says is most important -- and that's one more reason why this team had its success.
"Batting average is not as important as other things, like on-base percentage," said Parker. "We want the kids to hit the ball and make the other team play defense. Good things happen when you put the ball in play."
The defense for the Reds was what Parker would want to see at this point in the season.
"Defensively, we were the best all year," he said. "We worked pretty hard in practice, knocking balls down, making routine plays."
The Reds did more hitting than anything else happening to end this game with their bottom of the third batting which included Hayes with a single, Bishop with a single, De Simone walking, and Jackson hitting a 2-RBI single followed by Brayden Pedersen's exclamation point of an RBI single for the final score.
This Reds team was going to be hard to beat and the other managers of the Minors teams in the South Highline National charter must have known these facts by Parker.
"We had nine returning players, we won the championship last year," said Parker. "Our coaching staff is together again this year after last season."
All those things greatly contribute to a well run machine and last year before the season ended Parker and company, like the parents, etc. bought trophies for the team with their names engraved on them.
"We believed in you, guys, and we did that," said Parker, talking to his players after the game.
This year we didn't order trophies before the championship and engrave your names. But we had medallions made for you instead with your names on them."
So pretty much the same thing. The players know that their parents, coaches, manager, and everyone else believes in their abilities.
And,they couldn't be beat.
And, Parker knew that, too, as he continued to talk to his players while holding shiny medallion necklaces in his hand.
"We knew if you guys came to play you couldn't be beat," said Parker.
He was right, again.
And....
"The parents and coaches are all very proud of them," said Parker.
Players for the Reds are Cooper Parker, Cole Fenton, Mason Hayes, Tanner Jackson, Brayden Pedersen, Ronan Bishop, Saverio De Simone, Ulises Godinez, Tate Parker, Nicolas Balladone, Jahmir Jackson, Brayden Jackson and Sean McLaughlin. The manager is Chad Parker and coaches are Gildo De Simone and Bjorn Jackson.
Players for the Braves are Andrew Kubik, Declan O' Grrady-Graham, Mason Quinjano, Ian Ritter, Alexis Santos-Andrade, Garrett Gracey, Colson King, Owen McLean, Colin Olmstead, Zaire Polee, Tristen Trujillo, Daylen Whited and Cole Hennig. The manager is Dave McLean and the coaches are Abner Banwer and Nathan Wammer.

Kincardine’s economic development should rely more heavily on businesses and organizations working more closely together, according to the municipality’s economic development corporation.
The Penetangore Regional Economic Development Corporation (PREDC) held its annual meet and greet event on June 19 at the Best Western Plus Governor’s
“That’s what we’ll continue to do,” Coristine said, “because we are better when we are working together.”
Starting this year, PREDC plans to host business seminars and post information on its website with ideas for how businesses can share ideas. There is also a plan in the works for a future innovation centre to help new entrepreneurs get up and running. Coristine said it’s a large undertaking and PREDC is looking at potential partnerships and federal funding opportunities to make it happen.
Bren de Leeuw, senior community development manager for EMC (Excellence in Manufacturing Consortium) and a Kincardine resident, was the guest speaker at the meet and greet event. She said EMC was founded in
“It’s all about getting manufacturers to work together and share best practices,” she said.
Coristine said the municipality has seen a recent influx of new businesses, including Mirage Décor, Penetangear, Little Beginnings Daycare and Learning Centre in Kincardine and Patz Pizza in Tiverton, as well as the soon to be constructed Marriott hotel and convention centre.What is the Definition of Elegant Code?
I always try to write elegant code, but what does that mean exactly? Up until now, it was always a "I knows it when I sees it" kind of thing, but I believe I have captured the key points that define elegant code for myself.
In commenting an algorithm I wrote recently in theHeron interpreterfor resolving types,I felt an apology was in order to the reader. The algorithm I used for resolving types didn't feel very elegant, but I couldn't think of anything better. The problem I had at first was that I wasn't sure what made the algorithm inelegant.
In short the algorithm is this: when creating the abstract syntax tree (AST) I create place-holders of type "UnresolvedType" which contain the type name as a string. These are then replaced with the concrete type during a second pass over the AST. This is because the necessary information to create a proper HeronType is not available until the AST is fully constructed.
In forcing myself to try and write the comment, I realize that the source of inelegance was that it was too easy for a programmer to forget to resolve a type afterwards (which I had in fact done, and am currently correcting!).
However, I also realized that some of the other criteria I have for elegance were satisfied. This prompted me to summarize herewhat my criteria
So what is your definition of elegant code?Liverpool’s midfield to thrive in absence of Steven Gerrard?
At the age of 33, Steven Gerrard remains an integral part of the Liverpool team. So far this season, he has recorded six assists (joint second in the league) and averaged 2.7 key passes per game – third highest after the unstoppable Luis Suarez and the pass master Mesut Ozil.
These qualities of the England skipper are hardly a revelation to anyone with an interest in LFC news. The question is – how do Liverpool perform in games of high intensity with Gerrard in the side? How do they deal with opponents pressing them high up? And equally as important, do Liverpool themselves press effectively enough with Gerrard at the heart of midfield?
This season, Liverpool’s performance tends to drop in the second half. This was particularly noticeable away to Aston Villa (Liverpool did not concede only thanks to Simon Mignolet’s heroics), away to Swansea (drew 2-2), at home to Southampton (lost 0-1) and away to Everton (drew 3-3). In these games, Liverpool had to sit much deeper after the interval (and even in the first half against the Saints) and suck up pressure. It was their incapability of counter-pressing rather than cautiousness which prevented them from pushing up.
Brendan Rodgers is a quite pragmatic manager. He does not require his team to press high up the pitch and maintain a high defensive line when the players at his disposal or their physical condition do not meet the desired requirements, as the likes of Marcelo Bielsa and Andre Villas-Boas, apparently, do. Neither does he find disjointed pressing useful – unlike Jose Mourinho – who usually does not mind a “broken” side.
Nevertheless, Rodgers’ footballing philosophy is most definitely proactive, and he likes his sides to press whenever possible and win the ball back quickly. However, the midfield combination featuring Gerrard alongside Lucas Leiva is not ideal for this kind of football. Luis Suarez can initiate pressure from the front, arguably, better than anyone else in the league, Jordan Henderson’s energy is boundless, Liverpool have two energetic wingers in the shape of Raheem Sterling and Victor Moses, but the Liverpool captain is not apt at pressing high up anymore. Even in his heyday his positional sense was questionable at times, and nowadays he often leaves Lucas exposed when trying to act as a ball winner.
The thrashing of Tottenham last week demonstrated how potent the midfield trio of Joe Allen, Jordan Henderson and Lucas Leiva and the base of it may be. Allen is a widely criticised player, even among Liverpool fans. But his contribution to that emphatic victory was absolutely crucial. His positioning was very good, he pressed effectively and won extraordinary eight tackles, two of which were right on the halfway line and three – in opponent’s half. Henderson’s performance who pressed, dropped deep and distributed accurate passes was brilliant. Thus, having Suarez, Henderson and Allen all adept at intense pressing resulted in Liverpool preventing Tottenham from building attacking moves out of the back.
Pressing high up might be especially useful against Chelsea. When Southampton visited Stamford Bridge on the 1st of December, the Blues just could not deal with the high pressing from Mauricio Pocchetino’s side. Jose Mourinho had to alter his tactics drastically at half-time by introducing Demba Ba as an outlet for simple long balls. Such were Chelsea’s struggles against an athletic, relentlessly pressing side.
If Allen and Henderson continue the way they were crucial to brushing aside Tottenham, they will be key in preventing Liverpool from being overrun in midfield at the Etihad. Manchester City boast a powerful duo of Yaya Toure and Fernandinho, whose power might be matched by the work ethic of Allen and Henderson. Besides, Henderson offers a big threat breaking through the middle as he did brilliantly against the Spurs and in a similar fashion last season against Arsenal at the Emirates. Those runs might prove particularly dangerous against City considering their shape not featuring a designated holder.
The relative freedom Henderson enjoyed against Tottenham breaking forward owed much to Allen’s disciplined positioning who is keen on protecting the back four as Lucas. When in good form (and his performance at White Hart Lane indicates he perhaps finally is), the Welshman is quite strong defensively despite his rather diminutive stature. At Swansea, in his first season in top-flight football he averaged 3.1 successful tackles per game (10th highest in the league) and 2.1 interceptions. Fielding Allen and Henderson in the centre of the park at the Etihad would be useful as part of a cautious approach against a high-scoring side, and could prove an effective proactive move at Stamford Bridge against a Chelsea side vulnerable to high pressing.
Steven Gerrard remains a classy footballer. He has many strengths and, most importantly, he is a true role model. But it will be no wonder, if Liverpool perform well against Man City and Chelsea with their legend watching from the stands.
Liverpool will probably evolve away from having kingpins. It’s great, gives a team a focal point, but in modern football, a dangerous indulgent. Barcelona are trying to ween themselves off Messi ( and for good reason too). Liverpool will continue to develop 3-4 key players for the spine of the team. I personally find Coutinho to be the key to Liverpool’s fluency going forward. But am sure BR will prefer to have 2-3 other players with such similar impact.
Was going to bookmark this site but the amount of navel gazing articles on one team made me realise this is little more than a Liverpool blog with pretensions.
Nick, 3 of the 32 longform articles currently on the homepage are about Liverpool.

They are a bunch of great young men who had no intention of doing it the wrong way. I hope the school, especially the Principal and the Athletic Director, make the changes necessary so that no student athlete or team will have to suffer such consequences that are out of their control. I would hope the same to any school whose athletes have worked so hard together to pursue their dreams and goals. High school athletics is about learning, camaraderie, growth, achieving goals, adversity and life lessons to name a few. Good luck to all the young men and women in the state with their athletic and academic goals this year in particular to those who are about to enter into the utah high school football playoffs.
Wow good thing East isn't in Region 8.
All those jealous schools would have stripped them of thier Region Championship and made them forfeit every game...
Nice to know there is a Region led by people with common sense. In Region 8, they punish a team for a clerical mistake by an adult in the office that isn't even there anymore. Nice to know they don't punish the kids for an adults mistake...
What a joke!
"We're trying to punish the school. The biggest thing is, besides the four players who played who are ineligible, there are 126 players who did it the right way, and they deserve a chance to play."
If that is their argument, the same should hold true for Timpview last year, there was only 1 player in question... the other 126 players were stripped of their region title!
While I agree that it may have been in error that the kids were allowed to play, the SAME thing holds true in most other cases.
I think it was a Cottonwood kid but not sure, who moved from California and because an uncle signed his parents name, that kid was not allowed to play.
SO you will punish HIM for what others did, but not the rest of the East kids?
Again... what a JOKE and a TRAVESTY.
Shame on all involved in this decision!
Not so fast, they are meeting at the state tomorrow at 9 to allow the state to make a ruling.
Memo to rest of UTAH, put or take more away from other programs in school to fund the penalty fee (small beans) $1500 annually to skirt this rule. Wow hopefully, UHSAA will crack down harder on this violation. It doesn't discourage breaking the rules does it. A starter, wow...Way to do the right thing region 6.
Sorry but if the UHSAA does not step in and vacate these wins, the whole system is a joke. The hearing tomorrow is about the UHSAA doing the right thing. Hey, everybody has a story to go with their reasons for moving and transferring. But the rules are clearly spelled out. Blame who you want, but East High broke the rules and should forfeit all games in which they used ineligible players.
If the UHSAA does not make the necessary changes tomorrow, it is time for them to disband and let everyone do whatever they want. The rules are there, and I don't care who at East messed up. But where you have already gone and punished others, the same punishment should be levied here in this case.
@in-the-know
This is a decision by the principles of that region, just as the Timpview decision was made by the principles in that region. That is how the system is set up. Also Timpview had some other very serious problems occuring there so they were repeat offenders although not for the same violations. The situations are completely different.
In th words Ed Lover "C'mon son!" Since when does "we didn't know" excuse breaking a rule. There is no grey area here, if a player plays and has not been cleared then its a violation of the rules.
Take Jordan for example, they had two players ruled ineligible to play this season because of choices an adult made. If we were to follow East logic then Jordan should have played those players and when caught (and they would have been) said "well we didn't know, dont punish the kids because the adults messed up".
It might seem cold but thats the way it is. A right is a right and a wrong is a wrong. Thats just my opion though, we'll see what happens with the state meeting tomorrow. If they let East slide then I say give Timpview back its reigion 8 title from LAST year.
Alright state ruling you are up next, here is some help from your own guidelines.
*Article I Section 8 (c) - This one proves that the coach knew
*Article II Section (a), (b), (c) - These ones prove that the coach and the administration knew exactly what was happening and tried to get by it thinking nobody would catch it.
*Article III Section 1 - This one proves that the Principal knew.
*Article III Section 10 - This proves that the students knew
Announcers announce before every game the Raise the Bar Motto for Utah High School Athletics before every game, and now you are asking the kids and coaches and administration not to live by it and tell them it means nothing. If you are going to take action, take action. If not, then get rid of the rules because you choose not to live by them anyway.
UtahBruin - AMEN!!!!!!
I read the entire story, and still have no idea what "wrongs" were committed. What, exactly, made these four kids ineligible to play football? Is this the gestapo at work here? fourth string subs? kids who attended East for a year and a half--and they're ineligible to play football? you haven't explained exactly why they are ineligible, and who cares? is this a grudge charge by a rival school? Am I still living in America?
Gotta love high school football in Utah! This story would receive 2-3 lines as an after thought in a sports section, but not hear. Such indepth reporting!
Hey dumprake and company - the UHSAA has rules that are set up. East did not follow them, and Highland turned them in for it. What is it that you are not understanding here? East got caught cheating. Had Highland not turned it in, East would have gotten away with it.
Principals, AD's, and coaches are trained every single year by the UHSAA. Coaches are required to take rules clinics every single year before their season starts. I don't know what to tell you other than East High's incompetence cost a lot of innocent kids a football season. Tomorrow the UHSAA will strip the wins and they will be done after their game tomorrow night.
I agree with those who say to reinstate Timpview's 2011 Region title if UHSAA does not vacate East's wins this year. I am a Timpview football parent and have seen our eyes blackened far too many times to want to let this one go. The inequity between the two decisions in both regions, if not corrected by UHSAA, will prove that Timpview is ALWAYS untreated unfairly when it comes to football.
I think most commenters on the story must have read a different story than I did. No players were recruited. Two moved because of custody issues, one had not played football for two years because of a heart condition. They all would have been eligible had the AD followed through and the UHSAA done their job at the beginning of the season. But if you read the comments, kids were recruited and put in peoples basements, documents forged and payoffs made. I said it in the other story and I'll ask it again:
For all of you who seem to think there in no difference between
willfully cheating the elligibilty process and a clerical oversight in
which not intent to decieve and an imeasureble about of effect came fom
it, should ask yourselves if you are willing to go to jail for tax fraud
when you make an arethmetic mistake that benifited you $5 on your taxes
in 2010?

Big U Fan , I agree with you 100% they are reading a different story and posting it on here.
It bothers me when a team, school or coach uses a player's life situation as a reason to ask for forgiveness when caught cheating. Every kid has something going on in their lives that makes it difficult to be a student-athlete. There were a total of 4 ineligible athletes on this team! Not just a simple oversight. Please stop playing the sympathy card. It is not fair to those kids to have their private lives paraded out in public...unless that has been the plan all along.
A lot of people don't realize that this is not a situation that is unique to East High School, but things like this go on at other schools more than you realize. I witnessed a starting high school quarterback at a Utah High School sluff an entire year in some of his classes, basically attending school half a day most of the year and playing the other part of the day, sometimes getting in trouble in the community. This included an entire year's worth of failing grades in classes such as band, for simply not bothering to show up to class. His advisors would pressure certain teachers to come up with a plan to do make up work to make him eligible. He then took two weeks of summer school and valiantly made up enough credits to declare him eligible with erased year long failing grades in those classes. Other students in that school somehow had grades transform from failing to passing with no input from the teacher that issued the failing grades. An entire basketbal team went from ineligible to eligible when game time rolled around. The young quarterback was hailed as a comeback inspiration that fall.
The coach know and he played the kids. thats all I need to hear about the story. they should be 0-8. Same situation as timpview. The difference is that the timpview situation doesn't really matter anymore. They just released that one in the paper. UHSAA is too gutless to do what they need to when the people are standing right in front of them.
Reading again the data about "why" the players could be ruled ineligable... I could not help seeing the reoccuring excuse of "while they are good, we would still be successfull with out them"
School officials... you don't seem to get it! Its not ok as long as they were not good players or they did not contribute to the win... the win or lose does not matter!
If they were ineligable, then that is that. No matter if they have a great story or not.
If they were ineligable, then the games need to not count, period!Skip to comments.Texas Dem Official: Rick Perry Is a 'Hateful' Race-Baiting 'Insurrectionist'
Posted on 07/07/2014 6:16:30 PM PDT by equalator
"That's how the Tea Party and Texans like Rick Perry are going remembered: anti-immigrant and hateful and really insurrectionists. These people are supposed to be about patriotism, and he's sitting here accusing the president of conspiracy.
"It's perfectly acceptable for Republicans to hate Latinos and Arabs."
"They constantly fear-monger about Latinos and Arab-Americans and Muslims in the same way," she added.
(Excerpt) Read more at breitbart.com ...
Here is the same nutcase being dragged away from a Senate Hearing. She's worried we fear-monger about millions of criminal, disease-ridden illegal Mexicans. And she loves arabs too, because they're so dandy.
If the president is conspiring against the American people, I don't see what is wrong and "unpatriotic" about pointing it out.
She does a really good Debbie Whatshername-Schitz impression.
You’d think that people with a grain of sense, including leftists if any such exists, would learn to ignore loud manic women seeking public attention.
When the Isis muslims take over, they’ll rape/murder her last, because she’s so enlightened.
Only a racist would believe that OTHER PEOPLE are supposed to obey the law’s the same as they are expected to.
if Rick Perry is a racist,then what does that make Harry Reid? He hates everybody!
What, did perry do something about the endless illegal flood into Texas?
Everything I needed to know about Islam I learned on 9/11.
Their going to put us all into Internment campos
Whoops, they’re
La Raza Rick Perry, the man with a history of being pro-ILLEGAL alien is being called anti-immigrant?! LOL!!!!
Texas, I know you folks down there will fight these leftist, hate-filled idiots to the last man. Do not ever let these people take over your state, and we all know you won’t, or else you’ll be swirling down the proverbial toilet with the rest of us. The Democrats have no morals. It’s all about political power and control to these people. They will destroy any person or institution that gets in their way. They seek not to persuade us, the American people, to their way of thinking, but to manipulate and control our actions and way of life. They can’t be negotiated with nor can we form alliances with them. They need to be driven out and defeated in every national, state, and local political office. It’s the only way to save the country now.
Only stupid people grab the race card to win the argument. Getting in an argument with those people is like playing chess with a pigeon. The pigeon walks around the chess board, knocking the pieces over and crapping on everything. Then they prance around like they have the victory.
Hey, Sarah...I got yer “insurrection” hangin’ right heah, sweetheart. Heh, heh...heh, heh...
Well then, Harry Reid must be a Christian-hating, Tea Party-bashing, anti-American, Communist-loving, pro-Islamic, anti-Israeli, anti-Constitution, pro-illegals, anti-citizen pig!
Did I cover everything?
Gotta maintain the illusion that there are two parties, lest the natives ask uncomfortable questions.
He’s probably gay too.
patriotism is not to the president.
it’s to the Constitution and the ideals for which it stands
these tards actually believe 0fail-a-lot is a king
So, in reality, this woman is an insurrectionist, or a race hater. Did she not know being an official of any political party she is sworn to uphold the constitution and the laws provided by the US and State congress? This woman is an insurrectionist, or a hater of the United States of America
And Dems know a thing or two about hateful race-baiting!
I have never heard more name-calling than from Democratic politicians in the past five years. And the same people in the press that used to scream about when a Republican or two would use the word “communist” are strangely silent over these slanders.
Another tool trying to show up differences between the two factions of the uniparty when there really aren’t any of significance.
Rick must be doing something right. :-)
Anything important is never left to the vote of the people. We only get to vote on some man; we never get to vote on what he is to do.

If Rick Perry was to do his job the Texas National guard would be all over the border and the Texas AIR national guard choppers would be flying 24/7!
Da tird world
Yes there are.
Is there a reason Sarah Slamen’s name doesn’t appear anywhere in this thread?
Yup. Perry is letting his Democrat origins show - - - .
That ought to read “Democrat” and “Republican Establishment.”
They wrote the whole damn book.
Well, ironically, this woman is the true insurrectionist. She disagrees with facts, the US constitution and the rule of law. Maybe she’d be happier in North Korea, taking away the rights of others

Expand Messages
- of the nineteenth century were the wrecking balls of western
civilization. Their poisonous ideas challenged traditional Christian views and
seduced Europe and America into a grand social experiment in unbelief.
What philosophers discuss over tea in one generation is taught in college
in the next. A generation later it's taught in high school. Then it's in
popular culture and finally it's even taught in primary school.
Charles Darwin's atheistic theory of evolution undermined the Christian
faith of hundreds of millions. Marx, Nietzsche and Freud were directly and
profoundly influenced by Darwin's writings. The Darwinian contention that
human beings are nothing more than soulless descendants of apes who have no
conscious existence after death became the presuppositional foundation of the
whole secular intellectual edifice.
Ironically, Darwin's biographers freely admit that Darwin offered very
little original thought in his famous 1859 book "The Origin of Species by
Means of Natural Selection." Evolution as a theory of natural history had
preceded him by at least two generations. Earlier writers had even discussed
natural selection. Darwin's own grandfather, Erasmus Darwin, had written on
evolution.
Until Darwin, evolution had been confined to the smallest corner of the
intellectual elite. Darwin is famous because he tied all the loose ends
together and presented it in an orderly way that caught fire among a far wider
range of educated people.
Darwin is also famous for his extremely confrontational and racist 1871
book "The Descent of Man." This book was penned to counter the criticism of
his 1859 book and to fully and boldly develop his belief that human beings
are descended from apes.
The Descent of Man is unfortunately overtly racist and claims that certain
brown skinned peoples are less evolved than the Europeans. This gave great
momentum to biological based racism and gave it intellectual
respectability. Aborigines were legally hunted like big game in Australia. Belgians in
the Congo shot black natives with impunity. Hitler quoted extensively from
Darwin in his book, "Mein Kampf," and developed his claim of Aryan
superiority from Darwinian principles.
In the United States, in the late nineteenth century, evolution was taught
and discussed only among the educated elite. Evolution was taught only at
the university level and to some degree in the high schools. In the 1880s
only about 4% of American students went on to high school which was called
secondary school. Only about 1% of the population went to college. All the
rest were educated in primary school up to the eighth grade.
The well educated people in the US were increasingly secularized while the
primary schools still held to traditional Christian values. This led to a
divide between the upper class and the common man that persists to a degree
down to the present generation. Secular Humanism has emerged as the
dominant faith of the elite. Darwinism is its origins myth.
Karl Marx and Charles Darwin were contemporaries and familiar with each
other's work. Marx was influenced by Darwin and mentioned him in his book,
"Das Kapital." Marx subscribed to a philosophy of economic determinism. He
regarded economic gain as the strongest urge of the human animal. He regarded
humans as animals; as mere atoms in motion.
Marx subscribed to the Hegelian concept that human government is greater
than the sum of its parts. Thus we have the Marxist illogic that regards the
individual as worthless but if you put the individuals together into a
government then you have something of real value. Marx considered human
government the savior of mankind that would lead people to utopia.
Marx's writings inspired generations of revolutionaries that embarked on
the largest economic social experiment of all time. The experiment to see if
an all powerful government owning all property could create a perfect
utopian society failed miserably. Historians estimate that between 70 million
and 100 million people were killed by communist governments in their quest
for utopia.
Nevertheless Marxist ideas still guide the socialistic tendencies of all
the modern democracies of Europe and of North and South America.
A generation after Darwin and Marx a bolder and more passionately
atheistic philosopher arose. His name was Friedrich Nietzsche and he believed that
humans are most profoundly motivated by a desire to dominate others.
Nietzsche called this "the will to power."
Nietzsche was an existentialist philosopher. Existentialism is radical
individualism in which the individual must exert his own will and throw off
social convention to create his own unique life. He regarded those who lived
according to the rules as inauthentic, as mere followers and small minded.
Nietzsche rejected God's law and wrote some overtly blasphemous things. He
also had radical views on politics. He was of the opinion that all the
great civilizations of the ancient world were built on slavery and brutality
in which the intellectual elite lived luxuriously off of the hard labor of
the many. He rationalized that slavery and oppression were good because it
freed the elite to build fabulous buildings and produce great works of art.
Hitler read Nietzsche extensively and even gave copies of Nietzsche's books
to his officer corps.
Nietzsche's existentialism and atheism was very influential among the
intellectuals of his own time and reverberates down to our own day especially
in postmodernism. Nietzsche influenced the existentialist philosophers Jean
Paul Sartre and Albert Camus and their post WWII philosophy of pessimism.
The youth rebellion of the 1960s had many elements of Nietzschean radical
existentialism.
Sigmund Freud regarded sexuality as the principle motivator of humans. His
entire psychoanalytic therapy is based on the influence of sexual feelings
and desires. He was especially concerned with repression of sexual urges
and how that influenced the mental health of the individual.
Those he influenced went on to launch the sexual revolution in which
traditional family structure and fidelity were abandoned. This also is a great
social experiment that is ruining lives all across the world. Family
breakdown, child abandonment, abortion of millions of babies and the spread of
more than three dozen varieties of sexually transmitted disease are grim
witness to sexual anarchy.
Darwin saw man as a soulless animal motivated only by the will to survive.
Marx saw man as a purely economic creature. Nietzsche saw man through the
lens of power and the will to rule others. Freud saw man as motivated
disproportionately by sex. Their blasphemy and lawlessness has torn the heart
out of humanity and brought about the alienation and despair that leads to
lawlessness, family breakdown, serial killings, shooting sprees and teenage
suicide.
Darwin, Marx, Nietzsche and Freud worked no miracles and had no
supernatural accreditation yet billions of people follow them. These four men offered
nothing but a vain attempt at utopia in this life and no promise of life
hereafter.
Jesus Christ by contrast came in fulfillment of over three hundred
predictive prophecies that were written in the Old Testament hundreds of years
before His birth. He worked miracles among the people of his time and miracles
still occur today in His name. He taught us God's morals and He lived a
perfect life and then suffered and died for our sins. We receive forgiveness
of sins through Christ. He is the promised Messiah of Israel and the
redeemer of all mankind.
Christ rose from the dead and ascended into heaven. This also was foretold
by the prophets. Those four men rule from the grave but Christ rules from
heaven and is greater than all.

I will respond in some detail first for part one, then go into a
detailed look at understanding/interpreting genesis in a manner which I

part 2 and 3. Bear with me as this may get long.

you read Genesis not just as text to be interpreted in a basic sense,
but in a scholarly sense looking at the usage of symbols, numbers as
well as the local cultures and mythologies you see that a 24 hour 6 day
creation is not necessarily an accurate or correct interpretation.
It looks like? Well, there is a lot of "looks like" in the Bible. It
looks like God condones genocide, infant sacrifice when it suits him,
polygamy, murder, regicide, slavery, imperialism etc. It looks like
Jesus is an animal of the species sheep. It looks like John of
Revelation was on acid. Looks like is not a very structured or correct
way to look at scripture is it? We know this and accept it. Strangely
this breaks down at genesis.
We have discussed here before the fact that the bible uses symbolism,
allegory, metaphor and so on to describe events. We also all are aware
that clues in the text help us determine which is what. Yet for some
reason this seems to end at genesis creation story. For example,
Revelation is chock full of vivid, rich imagery that is clearly not
literal in the classic sense. We could list reams of verses here that
are full of references we do not look on as literal. Psalms,
Isaiah,revelation etc etc.>>
***
1. Probably no need to have said this. If you go back to and see what I was responding to and why I said it, you will see that my point was this: Sauce for the goose is just as sweet to the gander. If isolated or atomic "apperances" are per se proof of macroevolution, then an isolated or atomic reading of the creation account of Genesis 1 is proof that macroevolution is rightly rejected.
2. I see that in your email you managed to find old comments of mine. That's cool, and even I didn't know where exactly they were without really putting a search engine to use. So you may also be aware that I posit that the appeal to symbolism, allegory, and figures of speech can *only go so far* and can also be *misapplied* in modernist interpretation of the Scriptures. Sure, symoblism, allegory and figures of speech are all real, but there are also rules which govern their usage. If you see a rampaging, rabid dog get put down by an animal control officer with a gun and someone describes the event in saying, "That dog bit the dust," you don't want to say that the person was asserting that the dog literally bit some dust or sand; this is because of various abductive and inductive rules which govern the use and interpretation of language.
So it's simply the case that you find non-literal uses of speech in places in the Bible where others find none. I do not dismiss out of hand the idea that one may encounter an instance here or there of symbolism, allegory, or figures of speech in the first two chapters of Genesis. In fact, things such as these will not in general always have a narrow confinement to works of fiction, novels, or something else. So it's not the case that one point of contention at hand is whether the said forms of language are or can be used in Genesis 1-2.

You went on to write:
<<Let[']s go back in time to earlier discussions we had. You made the comment
"Then the LORD God formed man of dust from the ground..."--then it
should be that God formed man directly from the dust of the ground"
Here are the verses in question:
. "
According to you the Bible clearly states without room for wiggling
that humans (well, men were, women came from our rib) were made from
the dust of the earth. Ok, fine. It clearly states that. It ALSO
clearly says that God "breathed into his nostrils" and then went and
planted a garden."
Let me quote the following/
Let me add. So did God breathe into his nostrils? Did God actually
bend over Man and blow into his nostrils? Cos thats what it says (the
blowing bit). Clearly. Well, breathing into his nostrils would mean he
figuratively gave man the breath of life as some say. (I apologise if I
put words in your mouth - most people I know say this). Yet we have a
contradiction in our interpretation methods - man is CLEARLY formed from
the dust of the earth BUT God did not literally put his mouth on (God
has a mouth?) or close to man's nose and blew into it. So in one
sentence we claim part a is literal and part b is not.>>
***
Different thoughts come to mind:
(1) Notice immediately that you have two obligations to deal with at this point. First, I had actually offered a specific thought experiment or analogy, the would-be truthfulness of which is not contingent upon whether the nostrils argument is correct. So you still need to address the specifics that I earlier mentioned.
(2a) The second obligation is that you bolster the nostrils argument. It's necessary to do so, because it proves too much. The argument apparently is based on this assumption: that any (would-be) controversial phrase which appears in relative close proximity or context to such another phrase cannot plausibly be meant to be taken literally. But this is not a good presupposition.
I don't know if this is used outside America, but here we have the idomatic phrase "breathed new life into sb." If we take a broken-down, worn-out old jalopy and give it new tires, upholstry, engine (the works) such that it becomes a useful car again, we can say that our restorative efforts have "breathed new life into the car." Meanwhile, idiomatically we can also say that we "made some dough"--rather, that we earned some money from working.
So now just imagine if I were to say the following in natural conversation or writing: "The body shop really breathed new life into the car. So I was feeling good again, so then I took the keys, headed out and commenced to make some dough." Given the assumption that you have just made, you yourself would probably think that if you heard my saying this then both phrases in question were meant to be taken non-literally and that I simply left to go to work or make money. But this assumption is fallible, and you don't know what my occupation is or what I was doing when I got the phone call from the repair shop telling me my car was fixed. It could be that I am baking a cake for a birthday party, and I was starting to do this before I got a phone call telling me that my car was ready to be picked up.
So the nostrils argument doesn't really take us anywhere. Perhaps God did literally breathe into Adam's nostrils.
(2b) Apropos (2a), if you ask around I think you will find that the common, ordinary concept that one has of breathing is merely one of someone's expeling or sending forth breathable air--no complicated, unprimitive and added ideas or connotations of the working of the lungs, the biochemical reactions of muscle tissue needed to make that happen, etc. So the language of Genesis 2 regarding the nostrils apparently requires neither figurative language nor a theophany or the like.
(3) Now back to the specific analogy which I made so long ago and the would-be truthfulness of which is *not* contingent upon whether the nostrils argument is correct. I'll reiterate it. If someone says, "They made older cars out of steel," then it is understood by all that steel is presented by the speaker as being the primary ingredient or building block of the car or its chassis. Likewise: "They made the pots out of clay"--the pots were formed rather directly from clay with clay being a primary ingredient. "They shaped, molded and formed this other pot from a better batch of clay"--clay is again used rather directly and as a primary ingredient to form the pot. More examples can be produced (e.g., Gen 6:14; Ex 25:10).
But if this is the consistent behavior of the type of phrase at issue, then by analogy it should be that when it appears in Genesis 2, its behavior is no different. Consequently, man was formed rather directly from dust--not indirectly and billions of years removed from the creation of so-called star dust--and as a primary ingredient.
(4) So at the end of the day, no, it is not the case that *we* claim that one of those two passages is literal while the other is not, as you said in the quotation above. For all I know, the second phrase is quite possibly to be taken literally. In any case, there remains ample reason even in the face of the second phrase to conclude that the first phrase is almost certainly to be taken literally.
*******
(3)
You went on to say:
<<Also (and I have mentioned this before) but the 2 creation stories
appear to contradict each other. The 1st one says nothing about
being formed from the dust - it just says we were made in his image.
Which according to the bible happened both AFTER all the animals and
plants were created AND BEFORE they were created (looking at both
creation stories). If the bible is literal then both are true - which is
not literally possible. Adam and Eve cannot both have been made before
plants and animals AND after.>>
It is entirely plausible that the second account does not express the idea that man was made before animals were made. The thematic/chronological distinction of writing style seems to be a real one in ancient literature and you can read about this, for example, on Glenn Miller's website (Christian Thinktank). The thematic/chronological distinction of narration or storytelling is even increasingly important in cinema and the small screen today, with uses of flashforwards especially at the beginning of a film or TV episode. Meanwhile, a translation such as the NIV takes a different route and renders certain verbs as anterior/past perfect verbs in Genesis 2, thus resolving (as it were) the supposed contradiction in a manner which one would like to believe truly accords with Classical Hebrew grammar.

Again, the issue is not that we are related in the basic
animals/mammals sense but in that we have COMMON ANCESTORS. We have
pseudogenes that show that we not only are related to certain species
but that we HAD TO HAVE HAD AN ANCESTOR COMMON TO BOTH/ALL of us. THat
of course means a species that PREDATES us all. Did God create the earth
to look like that? Sure it is possible - after all, "it looks like" a
lot of things in the Bible. However, Pseudogenes are like tracks that
one can follow backwards to see what was going on in the past. The fact
that we and chimps have a 2 or 3 % genetic variability is not so
significant to evolutionists/scientists as the fact that the tracks
show an ancestor common to us both.>>
I don't keep track of the details of scientific arguments for macroevolution, so I won't address this. However, I am leery, wary, or skeptical of people's treatment of related issues *on both sides* of the issue, and rightly so.

arguments that I did not address (though some were inadequately

No, after I thought about it I think on one hand I forgot that later and indirectly you addressed Shaun's concerns and that most recently I had in my indignation forgotten that you had already posited that Adam was a real person, just not the first man simpliciter.

According to the verses Adam was of the earth/dust and was the 1st
Adam. Jesus is the second and LAST Adam. Yet between the two and past
Jesus there have been BILLIONS of male humans on this planet. IF this is
literal then Jesus was the last. Clearly what the scriptures are
showing here is that adam is more than just a man. He is a spiritual
representation of our initiation into our relationship and covenant
with God. It is not a statement on creation and how it was done. Adam
is a representative. The bringer of the covenant and relationship with
God.>>
***
The Corinthians passage is a miror image of Genesis 2. You still get Adam being made from the earth in Genesis 2, and there are clearly allusions to the creation of account of Genesis 2 in the Corinthian passage. So Adam is again said to be made from something other than "star dust" or primates. (All the more reason to reject the idea of mention of "star dust" is the use of the word "earth" in the Corinthian passage.)
The passage goes further than this, actually. If you have man's being made from dust in the common and naive sense of the phrase in Gen 2, then the whole purpose in asserting that Adam was merely the first "spiritual representative" of man is defeated. Sure, let Adam be the universe's first "spiritual representative" of man according to 1 Corinthians if you will, but so what of it if the passage still holds that Adam and his progeny are not genetically descended from earlier humans and ultimately from apes and primordial soup?
Meanwhile, the Corinthian passage is not the only passage using the word "earth" or some similar word in speaking of the origin of species. In Genesis 2:19 (cf. 1:24) animals are formed out of the "ground," and this similarity means again that any attempt to see the mention of so-called "star dust" in Genesis 2 would be a tortured one. Actually, Genesis 2:19 is interesting for another reason. In that verse certain animals are formed from the ground, yet also after plants and animals from which they are supposed to be descended. So not only does the book of Genesis contradict the idea that man is a product of macroevolution, but the book of Genesis also contradicts other facets of macroevolutionism.
And so I remain convinced that "TE"s take things too far. Even if you can make the case that macroevolutionism is accurate *in some instances*, you don't get proof of this belief system when it comes to the origin of all species, especially mankind; the evidence simply doesn't go that far. And why should it? For example, would it be so truly hard to believe that the creation of man (simpliciter) could be held as a special thing in God's eyes, special enough to warrant man's being created in a manner not common, unspecial, unremarkable, or pedestrian as the common route of macroevolution?

Finally, you wrote:
<<The verse in mathew is as follows:
Mat 19:4 He answered,
"Have you not read that he who created them from the beginning made
them male and female,
God created them male and female. Yah, God did. Any TE would agree with
that. Also, lets stop for a minute and just pretend that evolution is
totally proved fact and beyond debate. Would Paul or Jesus mentioned
that or have made allusion to that in their interactions with the
people of their day? No, why would they? Paul would know nothing of it
(unless God told him) and Jesus would have no need (and anyhow, what
would he have said, "Boys, have you ever heard of DNA...") to mention
it.
Ok, this is long. I hope you were kind enough to hang in there! If not,

I doubt that you will find no one who says there was no Adam but also that God used evolution to create mankind.

Re:
Here is a summary of what I thought of the articles or material that you reproduced. The material is speculative but do not seem to offer much in the way of conclusive or well-grounded arguments. They seem more catered as a preaching to the choir and not as a truly persuasive piece of writing.
Evolutionists may read them and get a chill down their spine like our friend Chris. Old-earth creationists may read them and be fascinated with particular theories on why a long era is subdivided into six or seven parts specifically. YECs will read them and see no reason whatsoever to change their mind, which is right; again, the articles don't really deliver what they seem to promise at the outset of one's reading them. The sum of it is food for thought, and some of it may be true; in the meantime, I think it's likely to just solidify a person's viewpoint on the issues, whatever his viewpoint happens to be.
As for the exhortation or call that I read comments on Watts, I'm not sure why this was done. As far as I recall, he didn't do anything to prove old-earth creationism over and against theistic evolutionism or vice versa.
Um, I guess that's all for now.

ABSTRACT
Although parental care increases the chances of offspring survival and reproduction, a parent incurs a cost of providing investment because it compromises its own future reproductive success. A parent has to effectively make split-second decisions regarding nest making, foraging, offspring defense, etc. in order to make the most of its time and energy allocations. To maximize the benefits in parental investment trade-offs, a parent makes investment decisions based on brood characteristics such as size, quality, and age as well as its past investment in the current brood. The effects of brood characteristics and past investment in the current brood have been studied extensively. However, there is an absence in the literature regarding the effects predator characteristics have on parental decisions and investment. I studied the parental responses to predator threats on offspring by guarding convict cichlids, Archocentrus nigrofasciatus. To better understand parental decisions in relation to predator characteristics, threats by a heterospecific model predator to offspring were made with variable wait times between attacks and by model predators of various sizes.
A parent may face repeated encounters with the same predator; how should it respond to defending against the same predator again? Because when investing in its offspring a parent incurs costs, the parent should put forth only enough effort and defense to repel the predator. Any extra effort put into the defense could compromise the parent's potential future reproductive success. If a predator does reappear quickly, the parent should increase its investment to ensure the predator is deterred. As the wait time between predator attacks increases, the cost of retaining information about prior encounters increases, while the value of that information decreases. Therefore, I predicted that when times between threats by the same predator are at or less than one minute, a female should increase her parental defense; whereas, if the time between attacks is longer than one minute, a female should not increase her parental defense. To test this, I threatened the offspring of 16 females using the following times between attacks: 0.5, 1, 2, or 5 minutes.
Breeding pairs of convict cichlids were placed in 76 liter fish aquaria (water ranging in temperature from 25-28 degrees Celsius) with six plastic plants and one terracotta flower pot. Within the first day of a pair’s spawning, the male was removed, leaving the female to guard the eggs. Removal of the male allowed for a more precise measurement of parental investment since the investment of only one parent was monitored. On days 4 through 11 of the brood cycle, I threatened the fry with a model predator and recorded the number of times the guarding female bit the model. I then waited the amount of return time specified by the treatment, and then retested the female. Results show that female convict cichlid parents did not significantly modulate their defense efforts in relation to the various wait times between threats toward their offspring.
I also predicted that predator size should influence a parent's investment decisions—the reasoning behind it being a parent would need to expend more effort to deter a larger predator. To test this, I threatened the offspring of 15 females using a large predator model and a small predator model and then recorded the number of times the female bit each model in an experimental setup similar to that of the first experiment. In this experiment, however, the time between predator attacks remained constant (5 minutes), but the size of the predator varied between “large” and “small” (the average adult female standard length is about 50mm; therefore, “large” indicates greater than 50mm and “small” indicates less than 50mm). Each female was subjected to both models, and results show that female convict cichlids defend more aggressively against larger predators.
These experiments provide insight into the effects predator characteristics have on parental investment decisions. Although the wait times used in the first experiment had no significant effect on females’ parental investment, further research could compare wait times with greater differences to find if there exists any consistency or strategy in defending against a returning predator. The second experiment offered insight into a guarding female’s perception of a heterospecific’s predatory ability. From this, further investigations of a parent’s perceived threat to its offspring and a parent’s perceived threat to its own safety could be explored by varying predator size, morphology, marking and coloration, and attack behavior.

Abstract/Summary
Like many cities throughout the UK, Glasgow has a long history of both urbanisation and industrialisation, resulting in elevated concentrations of potentially harmful elements (PHEs). Between 1830 and 1968 Glasgow was home to one of the world’s largest producers of Cr-based chemicals. Chromite ore processing residue (COPR) arising from the factory was used as infill material across large areas of SE Glasgow, resulting in widespread land contamination with Cr(VI), a known human carcinogen of significant mobility. A recent survey by the British Geological Survey (BGS) of Glasgow and its surrounding urban environment has highlighted numerous sites with total Cr concentrations exceeding soil guideline values (SGVs) generated by the Contaminated Land Exposure Assessment (CLEA) model.Sponsored by:

The Knicks acquired the three draft picks through a variety of means. The #21 pick was their own pick. The #18 pick was traded by the Detroit Pistons to the San Antonio Spurs in 1993 as part of the Dennis Rodman/Sean Elliot trade between Detroit and San Antonio. When the Knicks dumped Charles Smith’s salary on the Spurs in the middle of the 1995-96 season, the Spurs passed along the Pistons’ pick.
The #19 pick was acquired as a result of former Knick coach Pat Riley leaving the team after the 1994-95 season while still having a year left on his contract (letting the Knicks know through a fax – sleazy, Pat! Sleazy!!). The Knicks accused the Heat of tampering with Riley while he was under contract tot he Knicks. The dispute was settled in September of 1995 with the Heat giving the Knicks $1,000,000 as well as the #19 pick (which the Heat had, in turn, acquired from the Atlanta Hawks in 1994 in the Kevin Willis/Steve Smith and Grant Long trade).
So, armed with three first round draft picks, sources at the time alleged that the Knicks tried to trade up but could not get anyone to take their package of picks for a higher-ranked player (which makes sense, as, again, this was a highly regarded draft, so people weren’t going to let go of their picks easily – the Bucks got a future first rounder just for swapping the #4 and the #5 picks!).
Ultimately, the Knicks drafted Syracuse star John Wallace at #18, Kentucky star Walter McCarthy at #19 and Mississippi State forward Dontae’ Jones.
That’s a pretty disappointing haul, but it’s made even more disappointing when you look who was drafted around those players.
Here’s picks #10-21 in the 1996 NBA Draft…
10. Erick Dampier
11. Todd Fuller
12. Vitaly Potapenko
13. Kobe Bryant
14. Peja Stojakovic
15. Steve Nash
16. Tony Delk
17. Jermaine O’Neal
18. John Wallace
19. Walter McCarthy
20. Zydrunas Ilgauskas
21. Dontae’ Jones
Yep, just three picks away from two-time NBA Most Valuable Player (MVP), Steve Nash, and five away from Kobe Bryant (who has an an NBA MVP of his own as well as one or five NBA titles).
The most galling part is that Zydrunas Ilgauskus also has had a long, distinguished NBA career (including two All-Star Game appearances) and the Knicks literally drafted around him.
Luckily, for hindsight purposes, the following picks to close out the first round were a bit less exciting….
22. Roy Rogers
23. Efthimios Rentzias
24. Derek Fisher
25. Martin Müürsepp
26. Jerome Williams
27. Brian Evans
28. Priest Lauderdale
29. Travis Knight
Derek Fisher, of course, has gone on to win five NBA titles with the Los Angeles Lakers and was certainly a steal at #24, but had he ended up on the Knicks in 1996-97, I don’t know if he even would have seen any playing time at point guard behind third-year man, Charlie Ward, and Chris Childs (who the Knicks ultimately signed with their salary cap space, along with shooting guard Allan Houston). Jerome “Junkyard Dog” Williams had a good NBA career (ending it as a member of the Knicks in 2005), but it was not like he was obviously a better player at the time than either Wallace, McCarthy or Jones.
No, the Knicks’ problem in 1996 was not one of inept drafting, but rather one of simple bad luck. They were just one pick away from Jermaine O’Neal! Heck, Cleveland only got the #20 pick over the Knicks through a coin toss (the two teams finished with the same record in 1995-96), so that was another thing that just didn’t go the Knicks’ way (I wonder if the Knicks would have even have drafted Ilgauskus if they had the chance).
The draft looked even worse a year later, as the Knicks officially gave up on all three players, trading all three players before the start of the next season! Wallace was dealt as part of a three-way deal that netted the Knicks center Chris Dudley, while McCarthy and Jones were dealt (along with the Knicks 1997 draft choice, John Thomas) for the immortal Chris Mills. Jones, by the way, is notable in the fact that while he never actually played a game for the Knicks in 1996-97 due to an injury, he still managed to get himself suspended during the Knicks/Heat playoff brawl during the 1997 NBA Playoffs (so he missed the first few games of his Celtics career, a career that was extremely short-lived).
I guess Chris Mills was part of the Latrell Sprewell trade, so maybe without him they would not have landed Sprewell! That’s something, right? I doubt Mills was actually the key to that deal, but still, it’s something!
Anyhow, that is the story of the 1996 Knicks NBA Draft. Sad, huh? Why exactly did so many of you want me to feature this? It is way depressing!!
I always got annoyed with JVG for for not playing Wallace more my thinking was “he’s the only one who had any game” because the odffense seemd to bog down alot. LOL At least I had an excuse in that I went to SU and he did one-man gang them to the finals. Didn’t Jones break his foot in camp or have it broken in the NCAAs. Those were the days when rookies didn’t play which was OK while they were on their run but by then it was clearly winding down and the indifference (yes I mean you Frederic Weis draft) well you get the point.
Good point, Nick, I should have mentioned Jones’ injury was why he didn’t play for the Knicks in 1996-97. I edited it to fix that. Thanks!
Keep these articles coming! I started following the Knicks in 2005 (i still cannot fathom why) and it was this site that really cemented my fanatasism. Anyway it is really great to learn these little nuggets of history. Did any of the Knicks picks achieve once they left the Knicks, playing or otherwise?
As an aside i would be intrigued by a deal centered around Prince if he is unhappy with the coach. Only got a year left on his salary but it would probably take another team to get it done if it is even at all possible or necessary.
wow- i’ve never heard anything related to that riley rumor… where can one read more?… (who doesn’t want more reasons to hate that guy)
John Wallace did not have a terrible career. He just always seemed like maybe he’d smoked some pot right before the game and wasn’t in the mood to rebound or guard anyone.
tommy heinsohn still talks about Walter McCarty…
Seriously though, after Charlie Ward, all the way up until Isiah became GM and snatched Trevor Ariza in the second round, the knicks’ drafting was terrible. I remember trying so hard to be excited about Lavor Postell, and wondering when we were going to be saved by the Frederic Weis, and then the Nene pick – the one good player we drafted in that timespan – and we immediately traded him (along with Camby) for a gimp. Then when we traded that gimp, after paying him for two years and him only playing in 18 games, he experienced a career renaissance, playing 6th man for a very good pistons team, and now still getting quality minutes for the Spurs. Essentially, we traded Camby, Nene, and McDyess for Stephon Marbury…
I know that’s not really fair to say, because who knew that McDyess’s injury was so serious… I’ve been trying to figure it out, and apparently at some point he had microfracture surgery, but it’s unclear if it was before or after the Knicks signed him, and even with that, the surgery was in its infancy back then. It had wrecked Penny Hardaway’s career, but many thought that was mostly psychological. It wasn’t until later when Allan Houston’s and Chris Webber’s careers both took serious downturns after the surgery that people became wary of it.
In Layden’s defense — McDyess was considered one of the top PFs in the league before his injury. He took essentially an entire year off, then looked great in the preseason (17.7 points and 13.3 rebounds in 29 min/game) before he got hurt again — if I remember correctly it was actually thought to be an unrelated injury, although I can’t imagine that reinjuring the same knee twice was just chance.
That being said – for much of the 1999-2000 playoffs Camby was the best player on the floor — just ran into the DRob and Duncan buzzsaw in the finals. I can’t say I was particularly happy about the trade when it happened….
Just read Peter Vescey in the Post he seems to bring that (resigning by fax) and that JVG “quit” when it looked like the team would suck almost every month or so. LOL
Thanks Brian. Entertaining as always. Just wondering, though, if there is any public documentation verifying that Grunfeld was trying to trade up, and if so, who of that crop was he targeting? I’d wager that Kobe and Jermaine O’Neal were not on their board because the Knicks were looking to contend immediately. We were also behind the curve on Euros, so I’d guess against Peja (and Z, who of course could have been had with the #19 pick). If they’d traded up, we probably would have ended up with Fuller or Potapenko, only furthering our frustration.
As it was, the Knicks ultimately just went with people they’d just seen play in the Final Four that spring. I guess they were saving $ on scouting so they could throw it at Chris Childs….
Z-oh wow I never looked at it that way, I thought they picked guys who were great or at least good in the Final Four. I never looked at it like they were too lazy or couldn’t be bothered to do much more than watch the tournament.
I actually liked John Wallace.
BBA, I went to Syracuse (as I seem to be mentioning every third post sorry) so I was beyond thrilled about the pick and him. JVG wa sloath to play rookies and I think Wallace got the plays no D rap (perhaps well-earned but it was a long time ago).
Good question, Z, I probably should have tempered that point, as it was more a matter being discussed in the newspapers at the time as being “from sources” (as obviously the Knicks are not going to say “we are trying to trade up!”). I was willing to go with it because, well, it just plain ol’ made sense, ya know? But I’ll throw in a qualifier there! Thanks for the pick-up.
I wasn’t being fully serious, of course. But the point was: the 1990s Knicks were not looking to draft high schoolers or Europeans. They didn’t want projects. They wanted people who could come in and fill a niche (the reason they traded most of their picks away during the decade). The few picks they made in the decade were all seniors from elite programs: Greg Anthony, Hubert Davis, Monty Williams, Charlie Ward, Wallace, McCarty, etc…. Wallace and McCarty were seniors from the two top college teams in the country and had just played against each other to great exposure in the NCAA finals (just across the Holland Tunnel, feeding the “too lazy” theory! :)
It’s really not a wonder that they went with those guys (and Jones too, who’d also pumped up his stock with SWMS’s run to the final four). With all the great players in the draft, though, I really do wonder what the Knicks’ draft board looked like that day. Maybe Grunfeld targeted John Wallace and knew he didn’t need to trade up to get him. (Or maybe he thought he could combine Wallace and McCarty into one complete player. That guy would have been great!).
(ps– McCarty is now an assistant coach with the Pacers. And Monty Williams is head coach of the Hornets. So the Knicks brass was clearly looking for high IQ, high character players in these drafts. So maybe Steve Nash would have been snatched up if he’d been available? Just thinking out loud…)
Wasnt there a real strong rumor that during the 1999 draft the Knicks were close to trading their pick (#15 and we all know who they drafted with that pick) plus Chris Childs to the Cavs for their 1st round pick (#8) to draft Andre Miller which is who the Cavs drafted and kept with that pick??
Knicks-Magic game rescheduled for March 28th at 7:30. Damn, hoping they wouldve forgotten about the game and spared the Knicks from another loss. lol
Good stuff, Brian. Definitely an instrumental (largely missed) moment for the Knicks recent history).
Total speculation, but if the Knicks offer #18 and 19 to move up, say, 1-3 spots, I would think they could have. But, not knowing what’s going to become of these guys why on earth would you be so anxious to move up a couple spots to make 1 risky mid-1st pick rather than hedge your bets with 2 or 3? Maybe the Knicks really saw JO or Nash or Peja as a can’t miss prospect and just couldn’t get up there because others also were salivating about Peja, Nash, Delk, and JO so wouldn’t trade down… but I have to assume the Knicks were more trying to get up to at least the 13 spot or maybe higher and just didn’t want to give away their picks to more up a couple of spots. That makes a lot of sense. In 20-20 hindsight, of course, they should have given all 3 even to move up one spot and take JO. (At the time I wouldn’t be surprised if they traded up and still took a “proven” college guy like Wallace, McCarty, Delk, etc… missing on the higher upside risks who panned out really well…)
I agree. However, it’s not 100% true. Dontae’ Jones was a JC guy with only 1 NCAA season and serious attitude concerns… a risky pick. So, with 3 choices in 4 picks the Knicks did take one risk… Say the Blazers take the Jones risk (in a prelude to their Qyntel Woods choice years later) and the Cavs still pick Z… maybe the Knicks do take the JO risk with their 3rd pick… Maybe the Cavs take JO and the Knicks Z… they did trade for Turkcan and take Weis a few drafts later. They were largely conservative, but not entirely.
He never did anything in the NBA, though, so I don’t know how you can blame not playing as a rookie… JO, for example, barely played for several years and still managed somehow.
Wasn’t a particularly good one, either…

My latest LA Times Sports Legends Revealed deals with the Yankees’ Brett Gardner.
Check it out here!
I remember this draft vividly – we were all excited about John Wallace in particular, who had just had a great Final 4 run. Wallace showed flashes throughout that rookie year, but really let us all down during the playoffs when he got a start in Game 7 against the Heat because LJ was suspended. Wallace was terrible in that game and we went on to lose. I remember reading somewhere that he cried in the locker room after the game because he felt he’d let the team down (which he did). He got traded for Dudley the following year. I thought he’d a be a productive player for years to come, but he disappeared after putting up some numbers in Toronto. I think the Knicks even re-signed him under Jeff Van Gundy, but he never played and was gone soon after.
I will say though that while Chris Mills and Dudley sound pretty terrible, our team was stacked during that year and heading towards long playoff runs. We were two deep at every position except small forward and center, and Dudley and Mills represented quality depth. It was Childs/Ward, Houston/Starks, LJ/Mills, Oakley/Buck Williams, Ewing/Dudley. We were going for it all, so getting two decent veterans was a good fit and really not a terrible outcome.Yom Tov Lipman Heller [Paperback]List Price: $29.99

Young Canadians have little to cheer about in the latest jobs report, which showed youth unemployment rising to its highest level in six months even as the overall labour market bounced back slightly from the previous month's slide.
Statistics Canada’s April Labour Force Survey revealed employment among youth — those aged 15-24 — fell by 19,000 jobs in April, while the unemployment rate in the age group rose three-tenths of a point to 14.5 per cent.
Overall, Canada’s labour market bounced back from a four-year low in March, churning out 12,500 net new jobs — all full-time. That helped take some of the sting out of March’s massive 54,500-job contraction, though the unemployment rate stayed at 7.2 per cent.
Economists noted that young workers were the only demographic counted by Statistics Canada that has not recovered the jobs lost during the recession.
April was the third consecutive month in which there was a decline in jobs for youth and the unemployment rate in that demographic edged up to the October 2012 level, the Conference Board of Canada pointed out.
High youth unemployment has been a problem since the recession, when about 200,000 jobs for youth disappeared, with few of them coming back, said Pedro Antunes, the board’s director of national and provincial forecasting.
“So these latest monthly numbers are just more bad news. We just haven’t seen this segment of the labour market recover at all,” he said.
Antunes said he believes the labour market is fairly tight overall, and he has been starting to hear some organizations complain they are having trouble finding employees in some parts of the country. The problem appears to be that the jobs they are calling for do not align with what young people have been trained for, he said.
“We do suspect that what employers are looking for is not necessarily the skill set that youth have and that’s been the ongoing problem in general since the recession.”
There appears to be a correlation between lost part-time jobs and rising youth unemployment as, increasingly, the types of jobs open to young people trend toward temporary, part-time and contract work.
“Most of them are employed part-time or not fully employed, certainly,” Antunes said.
Youth tend to feel the brunt of a slow economy, Antunes said, because they "are the least experienced, they have the least tenure and they’re the first to go when there is a cycle, that’s nothing new. We saw that in 2008-2009 just like we had seen in many previous recessions or slowdowns.
"What’s really surprising about this recession is that it’s been so long-lived for youth. ... We haven’t seen any recovery in terms of employment for that cohort since the recession and we’re now running four or five years since then,” he said.
Erin Weir, an economist."
Ken Lewenza, president of the Canadian Auto Workers’ union, said he is concerned that the new jobs created have no impact on tamping down “chronically high” youth unemployment.
“Government should not allow the economy to limp along at this pace indefinitely — it is a terrible growth and jobs strategy. Persistently high unemployment in many parts of the country, particularly among young people, requires action on the part of government and industry,” he said in a statement.
“In failing to address the problem of high youth unemployment, we’re turning our back on young people struggling to find jobs, pay forever-escalating tuition costs and just get by.”
Despite an overall rebound in Canada’s labour market, April's gain wasn’t sufficient to offset the losses of the first three months of the year, leaving Canada about 13,000 jobs short of where employment stood on Jan. 1.
Among the positive signs in the report: Some 36,000 full-time jobs were added in the month, mitigated by a 23,600 drop in part-time work. As well, all the net new jobs were employees, rather than in the self-employed category. And the battered manufacturing sector added 20,600 workers, the best month in almost a year.
On the negative side, all the gains came in the public sector, with private-sector employers actually shedding 20,000 jobs. That fact surprised some economists, as Canada's governments are supposed to be in belt-tightening mode and have called on the private sector to stop sitting on cash and start spending to stimulate the economy.

Lemon MeringueAustralian Damian Cudlin will replace Yonny Hernandez on the Paul Bird Racing CRT team for this weekend’s Aragon MotoGP and his home Grand Prix at Phillip Island, the team announced this morning.
Cudlin, who has raced in both the World Endurance and the German Superbike Championship this season, raced in the 2011 Japanese MotoGP with Pramac Racing and competed in Moto2 at both Assen and the Sachsenring in 2012.
Hernandez, meanwhile, has been released from his contract with the PBM team so he can take over Ben Spies’ Pramac Ducati for the rest of the 2013 MotoGP World Championship.
Brit Michael Laverty, who has campaigned the CRT-specification PBM machine all season, will switch to the Aprilia ART machine for the remainder of the season. The former British Supersport Champion tested the machine at Misano last week and is hoping to improve the team's results in the final five GPs.
"PBM are looking forward to working with Damian at the Aragon and Phillip Island GPs where he will race the PBM bikes,” said Phil Borley, the team’s technical director. “With his experience and knowledge, we hope to continue the development of our bike and have a positive weekend together. Unfortunately, we will not have the chance to test before the race and so the first sessions will be important for Damian to acclimatize to the bike, the Bridgestone tires."Aspiration & Access
Strategic Principle
Raise students’ college and career aspirations, readiness, and success by offering well-designed services and support, particularly for low-income, first-generation, and students of color; encourage and facilitate students’ thinking about and planning for learning beyond high school; educate families and communities about the value of postsecondary learning; and develop a common approach, language, and understanding regarding the options available to students and families in Central Ohio.
What We Know
Deciding whether to go to college, choosing the right school, and finding the resources to pay for it are critical decisions in any student’s life. In most families, parents help their children make good choices. But too often, young people lack these family supports, particularly when their parents have themselves not had the benefit of higher education. Also, research shows that most of the young people who seek advice from their high school guidance counselors don’t find the information they get to be particularly helpful.
Strategic Actions
- Expand school counseling to intentionally focus on college and career planning as early as the middle school years and continuing through high school graduation.
- Involve parents and guardians in the “aspiration process” as early as elementary and middle school so that they become knowledgeable and continuing partners in understanding student achievement and planning for postsecondary enrollment.
- Develop a set of common metrics to track improved student access and success from high school through post-secondary education, specifically noting low-income, first-generation, and students of color.
- Conduct district-level and regional public education campaigns to show students, families, and communities the value of pursuing college degrees and certificates.This application is a continuation of application Ser. No. 08/533,757, filed Sep. 26, 1995, now U.S. Pat. No. 5,692,310.
This invention relates generally to hand tools, and more particularly, relates to an attachment for a power saw to enable plumb or vertical cuts to be made without the necessity of first marking a vertical or plumb line.
In the construction industry it is frequently necessary to make plumb cuts. For instance, during the construction of a building, carpenters and other persons working on the site measure and secure together pieces of dimension lumber to form a structure. During the course of measuring and assembling the lumber to form a structure, it may be necessary to make angled cuts in the lumber, and a variety of measuring tools are available for appropriately marking the lumber which can then be cut along the mark by using a power or hand saw.
In the construction of a roof, for example, boards are supported near their lower ends on the top edge of a wall and extend upwardly to a ridge line where they are secured to like boards extending upwardly from an opposite wall. These boards serve as rafters in the roof structure of a building. It is common practice in the prior art to install rafters with the lower or tail ends cut perpendicular to the longitudinal axis of the rafter and after all of the rafters are installed to strike a chalk line along a top or bottom edge of the rafters and then mark each rafter by using an appropriate hand tool to provide a plumb or vertical line at the lower end of each rafter. A carpenter then uses a saw to cut along the marked plumb lines to provide an appropriate angle on the tail ends of the rafters. This procedure requires several time consuming steps, adding to the cost of the project.
Similarly, it is frequently necessary to make angled cuts at the upper ends or ridge line of the rafters or in other structures, including hip-roof constructions and the like.
As presently practiced, all of these special cuts require careful measuring and marking followed by cutting along the marked lines with an appropriate tool, such as a power hand saw.
Accordingly, there is need for a device which will enable angled cuts, and especially plumb cuts, to be made without first marking a line along which the cut is to be made.
In accordance with the present invention, a simple and inexpensive attachment is provided for a cutting tool, especially a power hand saw, which enables a vertical or other angled cut to be made without first marking a line along which the cut is to be made.
In a preferred embodiment, the attachment comprises a "bulls eye" or circular level adjustably positioned in a mounting frame that is attachable to a power hand saw so that a carpenter or other person can observe the position of the bubble in the level and make a plumb cut or other angled cut without first marking a line along which the cut is to be made. Attachment of the frame of the level indicating device to the saw is made by using existing bolts or screws on the saw, which are removed and then repositioned through appropriate openings in the frame of the level indicating device.
The foregoing, as well as other objects and advantages of the invention, will become apparent from the following detailed description when considered in conjunction with the accompanying drawings, wherein like reference characters designate like parts throughout the several views, and wherein:
FIG. 1 is a top, rear perspective view of a power saw having the level indicating attachment of the invention affixed thereto.
FIG. 2 is a side view in elevation of a saw such as illustrated in FIG. 1, with the level indicating attachment of the invention secured thereto.
FIG. 3 is a rear view in elevation of a saw such as illustrated in FIG. 1, showing the level indicating attachment affixed thereto.
FIG. 4 is a rear perspective view of a saw such as illustrated in FIG. 1, showing the locations of bolts or screws to which the level indicating attachment of the invention may be secured.
FIG. 5 is an enlarged rear view in elevation of the level indicating attachment of the invention.
FIG. 6 is an exploded perspective view of the level indicating attachment of the invention.
FIG. 7 is a side view of the level indicating attachment, shown partially in section.
FIG. 8 is a view illustrating how a saw may be oriented to cut a rafter tail using the level indicating device of the invention.
FIG. 9 is a side view in elevation of the saw of FIG. 8, showing it being used to make a vertical cut in the tail end of a rafter.
FIG. 10 is a fragmentary schematic view in end elevation showing a rafter and depicting how a plumb cut is made at the tail end of the rafter to provide a vertical surface against which facia may be attached; and
FIG. 11 is a somewhat schematic perspective view showing a plurality of rafters and how a chalk line may be struck to mark the point at which vertical cuts may be made.
Referring more particularly to the drawings, a power hand saw having a level indicating attachment according to the invention affixed thereto is indicated generally at 10 in FIGS. 1-3, 8 and 9. A typical power hand saw without the level indicating attachment of the invention is indicated generally at 11 in FIG. 4. As specifically illustrated and described herein, the power hand saw has a circular cutting blade 12.
The level indicating attachment of the invention is indicated generally at 15, and comprises a mounting frame or bracket 16 having a cup-shaped housing 17 with an end wall 18 at its base and an open other end 19. A central opening 20 is formed through the end wall 18.
A mounting ear 21 projects radially outwardly from one side of the cup-shaped housing 17 near its base end in essentially coplaner relationship with the end wall 18, and a mounting arm 22 extends from the bottom of the cupped-shaped housing in generally coplanar relationship with the ear 21 and includes an offset end portion 23. Mounting openings 24 and 25 are formed through the ear 21 and offset portion 23, respectively. Although a particular relationship is illustrated herein between the mounting ear 21 and the arm 22, it should be understood that variations in the positional relationships of these elements can be made in order to mount the frame 16 to different saws or tools, depending upon the positioning and spacing of the bolts or screws in the saw or other tool on which the level indicating attachment 15 will be mounted.
A so-called "bulls eye" or circular level 30 is mounted in the cup-shaped housing 17 by means of a disc-shaped mounting plate 31 and bolt 32. The circular level 30 is first attached to the mounting plate 31 as by use of an adhesive or other suitable fastening means, and the bolt 32 attached to the rear of the mounting plate 31 is then extended through the opening 20 in the rear wall 18 of the cup-shaped housing 17. A lock washer 33 and nut 34 are placed on the bolt 32 on the side of wall 18 opposite the position of the mounting plate 31 to securely attach the mounting plate and thus the circular level 30 to the housing and frame 16. A transparent plastic cover 40 may be secured in the open end of the cup-shaped housing in covering relationship to the circular level 30 to protect it from dust, dirt and the like.
As seen best in FIG. 5, the face of the circular level is marked with suitable indicia 36 positioned to correspond with different angle cuts that may be made when the level indicating attachment is affixed to a saw 11. A bubble 37 is shown in full lines in FIG. 5 in the position it would normally occupy during conventional use of the circular level, with the level horizontal, and is shown in dashed lines in the position it would occupy when used in the manner contemplated by the present invention, applied to a saw 11 to make a vertical cut such as depicted in FIGS. 8 and 9.
As shown in FIG. 4, a typical saw 11 has structural components that include fastening bolts or screws 50 and 51 in specific locations. The locations of these bolts or screws may vary depending upon the particular make and model of a saw and a variety of differently configured attaching frames 16 may be provided to accommodate those different positions and spacings. The saw 11 shown in FIG. 4 has the bolts or screws 50 and 51 positioned appropriately for use with the frame 16 shown in FIGS. 3 and 5. Thus, the bolts or screws 50 and 51 are simply removed and the frame 16 positioned against the back of the saw, with the holes 24 and 25 aligned with the holes in which the bolts or screws 50 and 51 were originally received, and the bolts or screws then repositioned to securely fix the level indicating attachment of the invention to the saw.
The level indicating attachment of the invention may be calibrated by clamping the saw in alignment with a known vertical or plumb line, or by sinking the saw blade into a known vertical or plumb line, and then loosening the nut 34 so that the bolt 32 may be grasped with the fingers and rotated to rotate the mounting plate 31 and the circular level 30 to position the bubble 37 in centered relationship with an appropriate mark 36a. Thereafter, the nut 34 is tightened and the saw used to make vertical or plumb cuts, or other angled cuts as determined by the mark 36 or 36a that is used on the face of the circular level 30.
Accordingly, and with particular reference to FIGS. 8-11, a chalk line L may be struck across the tail ends T of rafters R and the saw 11 used to make plumb cuts C in the tail ends of the rafters without the need for marking vertical lines along which the cuts are to be made.
The frame and housing of the invention may be made of any suitable material, including 60-61 T-6 grade aluminum, and the circular level may comprise any suitable model, such as the Sears Craftsman acrylic circular level, model number 39891..404 Error. Page Not Found

Kite Surfers also out during the gale force winds
Extreme sport enthusiasts are set to take advantage of one of the biggest swells of the decade on the west coast of Ireland, caused by recent Storm Christine. Video: Valerie O' Sullivan.
Several dozen of the world’s top surfers have arrived on the Irish west coast to catch some of the biggest waves of the year.
Surfers are braving the storms and the waves at Mullaghmore Head, Co Sligo, with visitors arriving from California, Portugal and Spain to ride storm-lashed waves at various locations from Kerry to Donegal.
Waves of more than 10 metres occasionally rose to double the height with driving winds at Mullaghmore and off south Co Donegal coasts.
Irish Surfing Association chairman Henry Moore, (50), who travelled from his Tramore home to catch the Mullaghmore waves, suffered a gash to his face as his surf board snapped in the sea. He dismissed the injury as “only a scratch” as his board broke when he was paddling out.
Neil Britton from the Finn McCool Surf School in Rossnowlagh, Co Donegal, also went surfing at Mullaghmore. He said: “People from California, South Africa and Portugal and other European countries contacted me. These are unprecedented waves and they would have checked the surf sites in advance before travelling.
“We’ve had some bigger waves in the past in Mullaghmore but these are also quite extraordinary. The big surf waves have probably peaked, but we can expect the visitors to stay around for a few days longer to catch more giant waves.”Key things you need to know aboutDr. McLaren:

Sending Junior off to college won't be cheap. So don't let a bad deal at the bank drain even more cash from your pocket.
GoBankingRates.com this week has released its list of the 10 best banks for college students. The website scanned its database for the basic checking accounts that delivered the most affordable and convenient features for students, many who will be establishing their first relationship with a bank.
Charlotte-based Bank of America ranks No. 2 on the list.
Bizspace Spotlight
Banks have identified college students as fertile prospects, considering many adults can trace their banking relationship back that first account on campus. Students also are targets for credit card issuers. GoBankingRates.com says the median credit card debt of a college freshman is $939, and up to $1,645 for all undergrads.
So picking a bank with favorable terms for students in important. GoBankingRates.com says banks with free checking, ATM access on and around campus and online and mobile banking are attractive.

Dave Franco shows off his bulging bicep while posing on the hood of a car in this photo from his Wonderland Magazine cover feature, provided exclusively to JustJared.com.
Here is what the 26-year-old Warm Bodies actor had to share with the mag:
On advice from his brother James Franco: “The.”
On doing both writing and acting: “There are so many actors out there who sit around in between jobs, waiting to audition. I was doing that for a while but you get antsy and you end up taking these jobs that you don’t necessarily love out of boredom. Having something to do that feeds my creativity enables me to be more patient.”
On acting and fame: “For a long time, I can’t say that I loved acting because I was so nervous going to class everyday. But I kept at it and I became a little more comfortable and started having a bit more fun with it [...] The whole acting world is too much. Honestly, I have a freak-out moment at least once every other month, thinking ‘Is this the life I’m aspiring to lead?’ Because I really do cherish the anonymity that I have left.”

Summary:
Great vehicle
Faults:
The starter appears to be going, I think. When I go to crank it a few seconds of whining occurs before it actually cranks. I will be having it looked at by my mechanic, in the very near future.
The automatic locks don't always work correctly so sometimes I have to manually lock or unlock the doors, and my rear windows have stopped rolling down, the front ones work perfectly.
Lastly, the lift gate doesn't want to stay up.
Has anyone else experienced these problem and what did you do to fix them if so?
General Comments:
Overall, I am enjoying the jeep. The ride is comfortable and it has plenty of power while not costing me anymore on gas than my previous vehicle (00 Saturn LS2). It has a rebuilt engine that was put in at about 200,000 miles, so about 40,000 miles ago, by the previous owner who drove it across county.
Would you buy another car from this manufacturer? Don't Know

A nation-wide adult education program emphasizing Zionism was approved today by 500 delegates attending the Spring conference of Hadassah at the Hotel Pennsylvania. The program will be implemented by the 375 Hadassah chapters in 46 states.
The program revolves about the study of Jewish problem as they are affected by current social, economic and political questions. It was made clear by speakers that the Jewish homeland movement would be the core of the courses.
“Only through Palestine can we achieve a rounded sphere of interests,” said Dr. Jacob S. Golub, education director of the Zionist Organization of America. “Only through a Jewish homeland can we function Jewishly as a people.”
Mrs. Edward Jacobs, president of Hadassah, stressed the importance of studying Jewish problems not as isolated phenomena, but as integrated elements of modern life. She proposed the re-evaluation of Zionism in relation of the changing ideas of current times.
In announcing the program, Mrs. Emanuel Halpern, Hadassah education chairman, said the curriculum will be organized about problems and projects rather than subjects. As examples she cited the study of Zionist policy in Palestine and of the problem of anti-Semitism as an outgrowth of general social and economic maladjustment.
A group of Jewish educators is cooperating in formulating the enlarged program of study, Mrs. Halpern said, and a series of pamphlets written by authorities will be issued on a variety of problems.
The conference closed tonight with a mass meeting under the auspices of the New York chapter.Reviews by Mikklo

Really good game!Mikklo | Nov. 22, 2013 | Review of Desperados Wanted Dead or Alive - PC
This game is about John Cooper and his team. The game is a stealth based real-time tactics game with a very good gameplay and story. The story takes place in the old Western! John Cooper is the leader in the group of six people. All the people have different things they're good at. You will unlock all the different characters as the game goes on and in the end you can play with all of them. The game is long and you want to play it again because it won’t be like the last time. There is lots of different ways to reach the goal with the map. John Cooper is a bounty-hunter and your goal is to capture the man "El Diablo" but first you have to collect your team. The story is very good and you enjoy it during the whole game and works good as a story-game. The mechanic is very good for being a game from 2001. The AI is totally okay and I can find games today with poorer AI. The controls is good too and it doesn't have long loading time either. The graphics is okay for the time and if you play it, you will get used to it. I find this game very good and worth the price of it. It is good fun and I will play it in the future to.

Creepy GameMikklo | Aug. 13, 2013 | Review of Condemned Criminal Origins STEAM - PC
The game Condemned: Criminal Origins is a horror/adventure game. You play the role as the FBI-agent Ethan Thomas who is accused of murder. The goal with the game is to find the murder and prove that he is innocent by investigate the environment. At the same time you are looking for clues, you have to find weapons, for example a pip from the wall, to fight against the enemies. There will be a lot of fights and many of the fights is just like the one before but they are so complicate that you will never get tired of them. The gameplay is good, you are always afraid and feel unsafe. You will never know when something is going too happened and the atmosphere is amazing. Everybody who likes this sort of horror game should try this. The game is a little bit short with only one game mode but that the game is worth to buy anyway.

Good ThingsMikklo | Aug. 13, 2013 | Review of Complete GTA Bundle - PC
This is very good things, I strongly this for everyone who like these games. My memoires from the time with GTA III and Vice City are amazing and with this package you can get all those memories back. The package contains every good GTA game that you want to play, and all of the games in the same package. 34.99£ is an amazing price for this collection. I can’t find words to describe the happiness for this. GTA IV is an amazing game with very good graphic and gameplay. The big concrete world is not as fun as the enormous world in GTA: San Andreas but very good though. GTA: San Andreas is a game that everybody should have played if you are a gamer. The game is truly the best game made. The graphic is good for a game that was released 2005 and there is an endless gameplay. GTA: Vice City the game before San Andreas and have a really good world, like all of the other GTA-games. It is like San Andreas but with a smaller world and in a place like Florida. GTA III is like GTA IV but with 10 years older graphic. GTA IV Episode of Liberty City contains two expansion packs for GTA IV. These expansions are worth the money if you like the original GTA IV. They are maybe a little bit short but very good. I would recommend this to everybody who likes pc-gaming.

A century too late, Nikola Tesla is blowing up.
First, visiting performing artist Thaddeus Phillips presented the world premiere of his new one-man play based on the works of Tesla, inventor of the radio and first alternating current power system. Then, it was announced that the Denver Center Theatre Company will enter into a collaboration with Buntport, which hosted Phillips’ play in October, to develop its own original multimedia production to explore Tesla’s life and inventions.
Today, the Colorado Springs company TheatreWorks announced that not only will it bring Phillips back next season to present his Tesla play – since renamed from “Microworld(s), Part I” to “Capsule 33″ – but it will also bow its own creation, “I Am Nikola Tesla,” to launch its 2010-11 season on Sept. 16.
“I Am Nikola Tesla” will be written as an ensemble creation piece directed by longtime artistic director Murray Ross.
Colorado Springs has its own Tesla connection. In 1899, the legendary scientist came there to conduct an eventful series of experiments in wireless energy. Ross’ new production “explores this extraordinary and mysterious character, a real genius and perhaps a real fraud, and his momentous stay in our hometown.”
“Capsule 33,” among other things, explores the consequences of Tesla’s ideas being crushed by barons like J.P. Morgan because, without wires, you can’t make money. And how Tesla, in has final years, is said to have fallen head over heels for a pigeon. It will be presented in October.
The Tesla-mania overshadows a huge title on the new season announced today — the first Colorado staging of the recent Broadway hit comedy, “Boeing Boeing.”
TheatreWorks performs at the Bon Vivant Theater, 3955 Cragwood Drive, in Colorado Springs.

Article CommentsMOYES TO SPEND BIG
The response to Manchester United's impressive financial results is the suggestion that money will be spent this summer, with the Daily Express saying that David Moyes 'could be given anything between £150m-£200m more to make the squad he inherited from Sir Alex Ferguson "competitive" again'.
"It's fair to say we are focused on strengthening the squad," said executive-vice-chairman Edward Woodward. "We aren't afraid of moving in the market in a way we perhaps haven't seen in recent years."
No names are mentioned by the Daily Express or The Sun but both agree that there could be an unprecedented £150m spend this summer. The big teases. The names of Tottenham pair Jan Vertonghen and Mousa Dembele have been mentioned on the interweb so we'll just throw those out there with a 'yep, could make sense'.
SPURS WANT VELTMAN
'Tottenham are chasing Ajax and Holland defender Joel Veltman,' says the Daily Mirror, who claim that Manchester United, Arsenal and AC Milan have also shown interest in the 22-year-old centre-half who made his debut for the Dutch national side in November.
But Ajax do not want to sell, with director of football Marc Overmars saying recently: ."
LUIZ TO BARCA?
Here we sodding go again. 'Chelsea defender David Luiz is top of Barcelona's wanted list again as they prepare for the summer transfer window,' says the Daily Mirror for perhaps the 427th time. But Barcelona may struggle to get their man as a) Luiz has become a key part of Jose Mourinho's squad and b) Barcelona could only value him at £22m, which is nowhere near enough for the 26-year-old fun-bucket.
AND THE REST
Lukas Podolski has told Arsenal fans he is going nowhere...Manchester City could go back in for Porto midfielder Fernando this summer despite being knocked back by him in January and seeing him sign a new contract...Barry Ferguson is poised to be named as Blackpool's new manager after receiving support from his playing squad...Roberto Mancini, now manager of Turkish side Galatasaray, is considering going back to Manchester City to try to sign defender Matija Nastasic...Bolton are furious after being blocked by the Premier League in their bid to sign West Brom left-back Goran Popov on loan...Guly do Prado is set to leave Southampton this summer with no sign of a new contract on the table...Charlton hope to sign Blackburn striker Leon Best on loan for the rest of the season...Inter Milan and their new owner Erick Thohir are looking to raid the Premier League for reinforcements, with Nemanja Vidic and Erik Lamela the top targets...Coventry are lining up a move for Kilmarnock striker Kris Boyd this summer...Arsenal are watching Wolfsburg attacking midfielder Maximilian Arnold, 19, who has a buy-out clause of about £8m.PC TimeCop 9.3

Using the GPU !!!
Hi , guys !
Today is my first day ... Is it true that only Nvidia GPU can be used along with the CPU ? I'm asking because I have an ATI Radeon 5770 on my rig .
Thank's to everyone for any clue !
By default, yes, only Nvidia GPUs are supported here and then for Windows only.
But there are third party programmers busy with allowing you to use the ATI GPUs as well, through what's called the anonymous platform.
The upside of using this platform is that Seti could be ported to any obscure piece of hardware or operating system. The down side is that the user will have to adjust the science applications for his computer himself, this is no longer done by the project when they release a new updated science application. The graphics (screen saver) option will also go lost.
If you like to use these applications nonetheless, see this thread for a lot more information.

The Nihoa Millerbird is a tiny land bird that was discovered on the island of Nihoa in 1923. Another subspecies once occurred on Laysan Island, where it went extinct in the early 20th century after the island was devegetated by introduced rabbits. It has dark gray-brown feathers above, a buffy-white belly, and a thin dark colored bill. This bird got its name because its favorite food is the miller moth. Male and female birds are similar looking. They hves a metallic and bubbling voice.
These shy little birds spend their time near the ground in goosefoot (Chenopodium sanwicheum) and ilima (Sida Fallax) foraging for food. Their nests are constructed of grass stems and rootlets and concealed in small shrubs. Nesting may occur anytime between January and May, and an average of two eggs are laid.
The Nihoa Millerbird was found only on Nihoa and because Nihoa is a mere 156 acres, its habitat is very limited. On September 2, 2011, a scientific expedition began, led by U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service and American Bird Conservancy (ABC), to establish a second population of this endangered bird on Laysan Island to guard against possible extinction. A second translocation was completed in August of 2012.
Millerbirds have been absent from Laysan for nearly 100 years after a closely related subspecies went extinct in the early 20th Century. As part of a decades-long restoration effort, this translocation restores this insect-eating songbird to Laysan’s ecosystem. Biologists from FWS and ABC, avian husbandry experts, and a wildlife veterinarian took special care to ensure the safe transport and arrival of the Millerbirds at Laysan after their 3-day voyage from Nihoa.Bishop Murphy: No One Knows Where the Blessed Sacrament Is!
As I reported last week, my Pastor informed us that at the request of Bishop Murphy (Diocese of Rockville Centre) that the church would be moving the tabernacle back to the center of the church. I wasn't sure at the time if this was a general request or something limited to my parish. If it was limited to my parish, what provoked this request? Well now I know. The Bishop visited at confirmation time and was not pleased with what he saw. My Pastor, Father Joe, printed the request of the Bishop this week in the bulletin for all to read along with his response. I will print the Bishop's letter here along with my recap of Father Joe's response. My emphases and [comments].

Recently I had the pleasure and the privilege of confirming young men and women in your parish. It was a beautiful moment and one that I very much appreciated. I thank you for the warm welcome that you gave to me and also for the way that you and all those who work with you strive so much to make the experience of worshiping the Lord such a fulfilling and fruitful one.
As I mentioned to you during that day, I am very concerned about the comportment of the faithful in your parish church prior to the celebration of the Eucharist. I am not blaming anyone. I am not trying to say that anyone is at fault. I am simply saying that the comportment is not compatible with proper preparation for the celebration of Mass. This interferes with the ability of the people to enter into the liturgy and have the kind of active participation that the Second Vatican Council calls for.
In my judgment, a major reason for this is the fact that the Blessed Sacrament is reserved in a separate chapel that is so removed from the main body of the church that no one knows where the Blessed Sacrament is. I don’t mean that literally but I mean that. I find this problematic. [Yes! Yes! Problematic is a very diplomatic understatement.]
In the document of the United States Bishops “Built of Living Stones - Art, Architecture, and Worship” [Irony! Built of Living Stones being used as a defense of common sense. That made me laugh!] which is the normative document of the Bishops Conference in the United States on liturgical matters § 74 §, it is clear that the Blessed Sacrament is to be placed in such a way in the body of the Church that whether it is in the chapel or not, it must be visible to those who come to worship. This is consistent with the documents of the Second Vatican Council as well as with the most recent documents of the Holy See including Redemptionis Sacramentum. Therefore, I am directing you to begin a process of locating the tabernacle with the Blessed Sacrament in the main body of the ‘church. The most simple thing would be to place it in the center of the reredos in the place which clearly set up to have a tabernacle, and where at the last liturgy I celebrated there was a bouquet flowers. [I loved this line!]

Please do net see this as anything but an act of support for you and for the good work you do as pastor. You and I share the pastoral responsibility for Center Moriches. I would be remiss if I did not say this to you. I say it to you as my brother and as my collaborator with full confidence that you have both the love of your people and the pastoral skills good and holy priest to bring this about for the present and future good of the Body Christ in Center Moriches.
Please know that The Office Worship is at your disposal to help you in this process. If I can be of any help, you know that wish so to be.With my prayers and best wishes, I am
Fraternally yours in Christ,
William Murphy
Bishop of Rockville Centre
This is wonderful! Trust me when I tell you the St. John's is by no means the poster child for irreverence. I have been to many other parishes that are much more in need of a similar loving correction.
With that said, I am so glad that Bishop Murphy took notice of the problem, keenly identified the root cause, and followed up. This is excellent pastoral leadership. Equally good has been Father Joe's response. He quickly and happily complied with the Bishop by printing a series of articles in the bulletin about proper deportment in Church and then spoke at all the masses last week on the topic. He also indicated that he will be moving a number of activities out of the church itself so as to foster an environment of prayer.
He has also announced that he is preparing for a ceremony to move the tabernacle. I cannot wait for this. My great thanks and appreciation for their wonderful leadership and pastoral care in helping making the Eucharist, source and summit of our faith, once again front and center.

What a lovely letter from the bishop! I'm always happy to see someone more concerned with fixing the problem than affixing blame.
Sounds almost as if the pastor was just waiting for some support to "do the right thing" -- possibly countervailing pressure in the parish?
It is great that there is a ready made space for the move.
It is nice the bishop did the follow up on a visit.
It is silly - given all the parishes that have the tabernacle in the sanctuary or slightly off to one side or the other - to imply it will magically change issues of lack of reverence or increase vocations.
But where will they put the lovely bouquet of flowers if they have to put this tabernacle thingmabob in the place previously reserved for floral arrangements?!
One of the parishes in my town has a beautiful main altar, very tall and covered in wonderful carvings. It now has a one of the same "fake" arrangements since the tabernacle was moved to the back of church. Where we can all have our back to Jesus for a good part of the Mass. I see people genuflecting to the flowers all the time, forgetting that Jesus is in the back. Sad, sad, sad. Can I get this bishop for a day or two?
Leticia,
I was thinking of you when I read the letter. I knew you would be as thrilled as I am.
I hope Bishop Murphy continues to eat his Wheaties or whatever he is doing!
"Leticia said....
Shortly after our new pastor came he made passing mention that he would love to move the tabernacle back to the center from its little chapel-esque hiding place. His big problem now is in finding or buying something appropriate on which to place it - the church now has a people's altar and there is easily 50 feet between the altar and the wall with nothing but air and chairs. With any luck the whole sanctuary will be re-reformed, but that's a tremendous undertaking.
It is good to see your bishop taking an active role in making sure things are done correctly. Sometimes the "chief liturgist" title can be used for good!
."
What?! I had no idea this was such a likely occurance! What alternative Universe has this even happened in?? Shows what I know.
Wow, wow, wow!! What a wonderful bishop!! I'm almost giddy with delight reading that letter.
I'm in a parish where the Tabernacle is 'off the the side' of the altar.
I see people coming into the church and genuflect in everywhich direction EXCEPT towards the Tabernacle. I don't blame them; they just obviously haven't been properly catechized.
Let's keep praying that ALL our parishes and dioceses will have bishops strong and faithful enough to address this issue.
Amen!!! What a great and Holy Bishop !!
How does moving the tabernacle 'restore' anything regarding Jesus?
A tabernacle does not have to have any reserved sacrament in it and it is really nothing with the reserved sacrament - as can be seen in many old churches with multiple altars and corresponding tabernacles.
Not only a wonderful bishop, but a wonderful priest to take the bishop's request without the bridling lots of us would feel at an implied criticism.
Thank God for Bishp Murphy, reverence, reverence, reverence, that's what it's all about. also, belief in our Lord's True Presence in the tabernacle. Wish our bishop would do the same.
I am a member of the diocese of RVC and am very happy about Bishop Murphy doing as he has done. I have had my issues with the Bishop over the years before the latest Moto Propio from the Blessed Father on allowing the Traditional Latin Mass be said, which he only allowed in one church in the entire diocese. St Agnes has mass in Spanish and other parishes as televised on the diocese station Telecare have African masses, Spanish and everything you can name, but he refused the TLM.
He may want to now start looking at all of the parishes in the diocese with no crucifix next as I can count how many are exactly without christ on the cross but instead have the Protestant "risen Christ"
Pray for the bishop, the Pope and a full restoration in all things in Christ
What a great letter by our bishop! I am proud of him.
May God bless him always!
Thank you for a very interesting and uplifting post.
In the past I have occasionally attended First Saturdays with my parents at this church. I'm very, very elated at this development; finally the reredos have a true focal point.
I hope that something similar happens with the tabernacle at St. Mary's in Roslyn, my childhood parish.
A Blessing indeed. Our Church did the same, moved the tabernacle from a distant position on the left front of the church, where one would normally find a statue of Mary, back to the center of the altar, under the cross of St. Francis. Then Mary was moved from the right side of the church to the left, and St. Joseph placed on the right. Oh the times they are a changing - back to the future.
We should all pray that Bishop Murphy can talk to others and they to take a stand, not only for the tabernacle but for the Catholic churches to go back to looking Catholic. I feel strong that when we tried to become more protestant is when the Catholics and our children started leaving. When the church puts Jesus back where he belongs in the center, and statues and stations of the cross so they can be found and seen as reminders, maybe then the people that have become weak catholics and our children, we believe and love there faith that isn't watered down. and confession is brought back, and priest speak of its importance more than at Easter and Christmas, and make people remember when you missed a mass you had to go to confession before receiving Jesus. Now no one takes the church serious and it did when I was a child in the 50s and 60s Pray for more Bishops and priest to see these things. What a Holy Bishop may they all look toward this Holy Man take steps with him.
There are some great shops on-line that sell old church furnishings. Our TLM parish is building a new church because we are busting at the seams. The priest found an antique altar, stations, and sanctuary candleholder at king richards--- (you can google it)
No excuse for ugly 1970's church furnishings! Buy new, I mean old.
"It is silly - given all the parishes that have the tabernacle in the sanctuary or slightly off to one side or the other - to imply it will magically change issues of lack of reverence or increase vocations."
Well then, it goes to show you how faithful the Faithful are if they know of the tabernacle's presence and still act as they do. If it turned off the bishop, then yes, it will have a "magical" effect. As you pray, so do you believe...
It is NOT the tabernacle that is important.
Bottomline - it is a storage area.
Our Lord said to a privileged soul
recently. My tabernacle is being removed from the center of the altars. Why? I am not the center of your Lives?
We have the bishop's chair covering our tabernacle! God Bless your Bishop.
The tabernacle is NOT just a "storage area". It is the Ark of the Covenant! It is the place where our Eucharistic Jesus lives...Body, Blood, Soul and Divinity!
Thanks be to God for this wonderful bishop and may God bless us with many more!
Major error ----
the tabernacle is NOT the 'ark of the covenant' - never was, never will be.
Who teaches that error? Who can document it as official church teaching???
It is NOT where Jesus 'lives' either.
It is the place to store the reserved sacrament IF there is any to be kept.
It is not a major error.
The reserved sacrement is JESUS.
It is not just a storage place.
Anybody who claims it is not were Jesus lives, has no clue.
Moronic statements like this are why the church is a mess.
This is from the Catechism of the Catholic Church
Title: CCC Search Result - Paragraph # 1183
Keywords: -None-
Description: -None-
Body: 3 The tabernacle is to be situated "in churches in a most worthy place with the greatest honor." The dignity, placing, and security of the Eucharistic tabernacle should foster adoration before the Lord really present in the Blessed Sacrament of the altar.
This Bishop you can take with a "grain of salt". Many of the parishoners in the Diocese know this too. Many of the Priests feel the same way. The tabernacle needs to be in a separate place where people can sit and pay respect. Many healings and miracles have taken place by the tabernacle while people have been in prayer.
NO ONE said the reserved sacrament was other than Jesus.
The tabernacle is not the same as the reserved sacrament - just as it is not the 'ark of the Covenant' or the place where Jesus 'lives'.
The CCC citation speaks of location of the tabernacle - it does not back up the claim of it being the 'ark' or where Jesus 'lives'.
Hurray for the Bishop
Interior decorators always point at in a home for a focal point. Out focal point in the church is the Altar, not the choir or the priest sitting high on a throne. It is our Lord that is the main attraction and it is because of Him that makes us Catholic different than any other religion. People of other faiths come to the Catholic church in time of distress, I know, for I have had the occation of such events. They felt comfortable even though they did not know why or understand that we have a Crucifix. We need more Bishops who will stand up and recognize what is important.
When I enter the church, I look for the tabernacle and sometimes you can not find it. The sanctuary light is also moved in some cases. I always look for the sanctuary light for I know I will find my Lord close by. A reminder why I am Catholic.
God Love you,
The Bishop could always put up a sign that says" This way to the Tabernacle". It is much cheaper than moving it and wasting the Parishoners money.
The sanctuary light is a sign that there is reserved sacrament in the tabernacle and is located near the tabernacle.
It is not about Jesus being 'nearby'.
If the light is not on the tabernacle is empty.
Kudos to the Bishop, but keep in mind this bishop isn't exactly a champion of orthodoxy and orthopraxis. He's probably minding his ps and qs to avoid drawing more negative attention to himself since all of his scandals:
Yes! Yes! Yes!!! I recently went to the Sunday afternoon Mass at your parish (sorry, but that was a big mistake! Drums and yucky music) and was absolutely dismayed at the lack of the presence of the Tabernacle. In fact, as I was reading this post, it was your parish that came to mind...and then I read further about the band blocking the doors...and I thought to myself "Coincidence?" and then I saw the picture of the beautiful reredo and I KNEW I was thinking of the right parish. For the life of me I could not understand why there was a plant in the place of the Tabernacle. Now, I am happy to hear the Tabernacle will be front and center.
Now if only they could get rid of that crappy "Lifeteen" music junk and bring back real hymns into the Mass. I understand that this Mass is geared towards teens, but they deserve better. Heck, I've exposed my second-grade catechism class to Latin hymns...no reason that teens should get any less! :)
Another poster noted that the altar is the focal point of the church. It is where we celebrate the Mass. People forget that the tabernacle is not part of the altar.
Most of what has taken place, the demise of the appearance of the church, lack of reverence, attendance, un catechised youth, etc-mostly if not all has to do with Vatican II though never mentioned by name because one does not want to throw stones at a valid council, which I could not help but notice Bishop Murphy continued to refer to. If you read into his letter, his main reasoning for putting the blessed sacrament back was due to the "participation" of the laity as mandated by the Second Vatican Council. Do the laity really feel such a need to do a reading, sing and clap along, and walk through the sacresty? Do they need the attention that bad?
What I wonder is there anyway that the church can reverse this council without admitting that she was wrong?
There is no reason to 'reverse' Vatican II.
There is no reason to reverse Vatican II?
Well, by the fruits one shall know them!
I guess with the liturgy that is abused on down to clergy who abuse the youth, the liberalizing reforms have just done wonders for those who want to remain part of the church Christ established here on earth for one reason-Salvation of souls
When you have Shepherds such as those in Connecticut, Mahoney in LA, Law in Boston, on and on-responsible for the salvation of the souls of their flock but so willing to put them at risk, one has to look at the loopholes and liberal interpretation these 16 council documents have caused
The council of Trent was called for many reasons, much to do with the abuse of the liturgy.
One can only wait for such to take place probably not in my lifetime, but it will have to because the church can not go on the way it has where a gesture such as placing the blessed sacrament back in the center is cause for celebration!!
Are these complaints truly the 'fruits' of Vatican II?
Or are they the 'fruits' of those who objected to it, who found ways to undermine how it was implemented?
No, these are the fruits, as it is due to those who have fully embraced Vatican II and it penchant for vagueness, ambiguity, freedom of religion, and ecumenism that we have this problem today
Deny it would not be correct
But to embrace error would be to condone such
The tabernacle is based on the historic "Ark of the Covenant" which housed the Ten Commandments.
A Catholic tabernacle houses the Blessed Sacrament. Jesus Christ IS the New Covenant in Eucharist Form.
The tabernacle is "the complete fulfillment of what the Ark of the Covenant represented!
Yes!!!
And so because Jesus Christ is the New Covenant in Eucharist Form...
The tabernacle is the "ark of the NEW Covenant"!!!
May God bless us all!
Praised be Jesus Christ truly present in the Eucharist!!
To the person who wants the tabernacle off in a side chapel so there's a place for quiet prayer --instead of front and center:
There's no reason why you can't have BOTH. Many churches now have a perpetual adoration chapel AND a centrally located tabernacle....
Jesus isn't limited to one physical location per church building, after all! =)December 26, 2009

For most a trip to Shreveport for the Independence Bowl is a look at a foreign city - a new place to explore and see for a few days during the holiday season. For Texas A&M freshman linebacker Jonathan Stewart, however, it's home.The 6-foot-4, 227-pounder who started seven games this season graduated from C.E. Byrd High School in Shreveport last May, and last year at this time had just wrapped up his senior season. Now he's going to be able to suit up once again in front of a hometown crowd."I was thinking about coming back home," Stewart said of the prospects of playing in the Independence Bowl. "Everything has it's positives in life, and fortunately I just got back to Shreveport."For most true freshmen in college football, a trip home for a game wouldn't necessarily mean playing time. Stewart went to College Station, however, and walked into a perfect situation where the Aggies needed immediate help at linebacker. To go along with the already thin ranks, sophomore Ricky Cavanaugh suffered a knee injury that ultimately ended his 2009 season.After showing the ability to quickly grasp the Aggie defense, Stewart moved into a first-team spot during August training camp and made his first start in the season opener against New Mexico. ...More...

Drinking Water Inspectorate
Private Water Supplies Operational Policy and Procedure Statement.
Any private water supply can pose a threat to health unless the water is properly protected and treated. The supply may become contaminated with harmful micro-organisms, chemicals, or other substances. Many are harmless, but some may cause serious illness or even death in vulnerable people. You may not be able to tell whether your water is safe as contamination may not show by smell, taste or colour of the water.
These regulations came into force in January 2010 and replaced the previous 1991 regulations. The Drinking Water Inspectorate (DWI) serve as the advisory body for the implementation of the regulations and produce guidance to help local authorities and private water supply operators comply with the law.
The regulations classify private water supplies into three categories, excluding those to single domestic dwellings. The classification of a supply is primarily dependent upon the number and type of premises served and the volume of water used. The regulations have also introduced a new requirement for local authorities to monitor onward distribution systems.
An onward distribution system is found where water is supplied by a water undertaker or licensed supplier and is then further distributed by a third party.
Whichever supply is applicable, the principles remain the same, Huntingdonshire District Council must (with the exception of SPDs) risk assess the supply and monitor it in accordance with the information obtained.
When monitoring, Huntingdonshire District Council needs to be satisfied that the abstracted or distributed water meets the proscribed criteria for wholesomeness.
Should a sample fail to be wholesome, Huntingdonshire District Council must carry out an investigation to determine the cause and has a range of options available to ensure a safe and wholesome supply.
If the house you and your family live in is the only property supplied by a water source, and only your family drink the water, Huntingdonshire District Council will not carry out a risk assessment unless you ask us. We will also charge for this service.
The regulations are designed to be cost neutral, i.e. to be delivered at no cost to the Huntingdonshire District Council. To enable this the regulations state the maximum fees that can be charged for the various aspects of private water supply work.
For an up-to-date summary of the costs involved, refer to the 'Private Water Supplies Operational Policy and Procedure Statement'. For further general information on Private Water Supplies, refer to the Guidance pages of the DWI website.
If you have recently received a letter with regards to 'Onward Distribution Systems' you can access the electronic version of the questionnaire in the linked documents.

This means that your program has crashed; the kernel saves a memory image of
the process when it crashed as the file 'core'. You can use the GNU symbolic

tell you which signal caused the program to terminate, or to step through its
execution to see where it goes wrong.
Lots of things can cause a program to work fine on IRIX but crash on Linux.
Aren't most SGIs 64-bit? Could be a 32-vs-64-bit problem. Also suspect
endianness problems (IA32 and therefore Linux running on IA32 is

Music was in the air at Pyne Road Park Saturday night during the Junior Service League’s “Pickin in the Park” concert.
Hundreds filled up the park as they awaited performances by the Marshall Tucker Band, Wet Willie and up and coming band Paris Luna.
Susan Riley and Lyn Gabriel drove from Lizella Saturday to see the Marshall Tucker Band.
“I grew up with Chris Hicks (a member of the band) and he lived a mile away from me,” said Gabrielle. “I was excited when I won the tickets to the concert to see the band.”
They planned on dancing and having a good time at the concert.
Others who came to see Wet Willie and the Marshall Tucker Band became new fans of Paris Luna after the band’s performance. They were the first to perform.
“We like Paris Luna now. Their music was really good. We really enjoyed it,” said Emily Price.
Price and her husband and friends said that it was great to be able to attend their first concert in LaGrange.
Much of the younger crowd did not know much about the bands, but were there to have a good time.
“When I heard people talking about it, it sounded like it would be fun and I’ve never been to a concert,” said Jamie Palmer. “It’s a good time for me and my friends to just hang out and hear some new music.”
The concert benefited the West Georgia Health Community Cancer Center; the JSL said that they would like to have the event annually.Beek

The silly thing is of course that your resolution isn't sufficient to make it clear whether Branden is being reasonable by kicking people off the channel. You simply require that standard Debian policies would apply, but it's not clear that any such policies exist or would prevent Branden from kicking off non-developers. Yes, most Debian lists are public. First, note that there are Debian lists that are non-public--more than just debian-private. Second note that the list creation template allows for the creation of private lists. Yes the listmasters probably tend to reject such requests without justification, but I think that it is sufficiently unclear what is policy, what is common practice, etc that this resolution will leave us in a strictly worse situation than we find ourselves in today. Perhaps the effort on -private failed because it was handled badly. I'd suggest trying to get consensus on small points. For example, try to get consensun on what level of agreement within the channel is required to kick people off. You might find that you could get people to agree that kicking someone off that a significant fraction of the people on the channel want around is considered rude and thus shouldn't be done. You might find that kicking people off with any objection at all from developers on the channel is considered rude. If you can't get consensus on any of these points--not even on a mininum level of agreement is required to get rid of someone then why do you think you will do better with a GR?The combination of Linn’s 3K driver array and a powerful isobarik bass system mounted in a beautifully curved, resonance-free cabinet makes Akubarik an exceptional passive speaker.

To say that the Kennedy brothers were popular was an understatement. The two hottest Halloween costumes at the class party that year, less than a month before JFK was shot, had been John and Bobby plastic masks. My first inkling that something big had happened on November 22, 1963, was when I got in the car and the mom who was driving carpool that day said nothing but only sobbed the drive home.
I heard Roger Stone do a radio interview on his book and realized I had read little to nothing on the assassination of John F. Kennedy. I didn’t go see the Oliver Stone film. I found it strange that I’ve read books on the Viet Nam War and Watergate – the other two defining political events in my growing up years – but I had never taken the time to accept or reject the Warren Commission. It’s interesting that in the back of my mind I’ve sort of known there are two self-contradictory popular beliefs that guide popular perception on the Kennedy Assassination:
- the Warren Report is seriously flawed
- anyone that presents an alternative view of the Warren Report is a kook
So who does Roger Stone – longtime political strategist for Richard Nixon, Ronald Reagan, George H. Bush, and George W. Bush – say killed JFK? Since he has a picture of President Lyndon Baines Johnson on the cover and subtitles the book, The Case Against LBJ, I’m not giving a spoiler to tell you where this book is going. (Note: Stone is equally hard on Republicans as Democrats; he is an equal opportunity sledgehammer.) [Read more…]Graduate Studies in English

whom the real credit must go for educating me, and thousands of others
across the country. Anything written by Pavel is definitely required

worth the money. You will not regret it.
PART 1
PART 1
The old Pararescue "Bible" ARRSR 55-11, Vol II (1 Sept 1983), Chapter 8, section 15 is titled
Physical Readiness. This regulation was the
collective work of the Vietnam era legends who fought hard and took the
fight to the enemy in the most noble of military professions, Combat
Search and Rescue. These men flew as far north as the Chinese border of
Vietnam to recover downed aircrews. They operated in Vietnam, Thailand,
Laos, and Cambodia. Many lost their lives, and many heroes were born.
What’s more, the wealth of knowledge that was gained from ten years of
fighting is still invaluable today.
ARRSR 55-11, Chapter 8-15, Paragraph a. states the following:
"Total fitness for combat includes
technical fitness, mental and emotional fitness, and physical fitness. If
any of these attributes are lacking, combat effectiveness suffers
proportionately. Without technical fitness, a Pararescuemen lacks the
knowledge and skill for combat, without mental and emotional fitness, he
lacks the incentive and confidence for combat, and without physical
fitness he lacks the physical ability and stamina for
combat."
The chapter goes on to identify several key factors that are vital for
combat performance such as "the ability
to recover from exertion rapidly". It further
states, "A sound body, free of disease
and defect, does not in itself constitute physical
fitness." This is a point that seems to be lost on
the majority of folks, and vice versa, working out with an unsound body
does not constitute physical fitness either. There’s more: "Before an untrained Pararescuemen can be considered
physically fit for combat, he must develop the following important
traits.
The authors go further to ensure there is no
confusion.
MUSCULAR ENDURANCE. The Pararescueman needs muscular endurance
to perform his duties under the most tiring combat conditions. Muscular
endurance is characterized by the ability to perform continuous work over
long periods of time. The ability to endure depends on the ability of the
blood and circulatory system to deliver large amounts of oxygen and
nutrients to the muscles while rapidly carrying away the waste
products.
CIRCULO-RESPIRATORY ENDURANCE. The development of wind
(circulo-respiratory endurance) is necessary to maintain muscular
endurance. Circulo-respiratory endurance depends the efficiency of the
blood vessels, lungs, and heart. The maximum effort a man can exert over a
period of time is limited by his capacity to absorb oxygen and expel
carbon dioxide. The average man’s circulo-respiratory capacity can be
greatly increases by exercise.
AGILITY
A Pararescueman must be able to change direction quickly and as
faultlessly as possible. The ability to react instantly and to maintain
equilibrium during rapid changes of body position may save his life. This
important characteristic of agility may be developed by conditioning
exercises that require varied and rapid changes of body position on the
ground and in the air (e.g. when falling or jumping).
COORDINATION
Coordination is the ability to move all parts of the body in a smooth,
efficient, and concerted effort (commonly called timing). A
well-coordinated individual does not make useless movements. He moves with
precision and accuracy and thus saves energy. Coordination is best
developed by practicing diversified muscular activities and skills
affecting all body parts.
Thus far, our forefathers have imparted their wisdom on the physical
fitness traits needed to survive, and thrive in combat. This is not unlike
reading something a great martial arts grandmaster has written. Every time
I read it, something new pops out. Most usually I am reminded that most of
us forget the basics. Further on the chapter lists and describes 21
"Basic Physical Skills":
In addition to those skills listed above, it is also stated that
activities such as Rucksack Speed
Marching, cross country running, wind sprints, and circuit
training are vital parts of true combat fitness. I
would include swimming to this list.
With a guide like this you would think that life on the teams when it
comes to physical fitness is a breeze. It isn’t. Unfortunately ARRSR 55-11
is not officially used any more. The USAF Air Rescue and Recovery Service
(ARRS) doesn’t exist anymore, and the military has a funny way of
discarding the past, doomed to repeat the mistakes made years earlier. The
huge surge of bodybuilding and aerobics in this country clouded the minds
of those who designed fitness programs in the military, and in branches
like the US Army, rhyme, reason, and logic are non-existent in their daily
PT.
As a Pararescueman, normally referred to as a PJ, I received a very
good education in athletics when I went through selection and the
following pipeline of Jump School, Combat Diver School, SERE School,
Military Freefall School, and Pararescue School. I was a farmer and logger
from northeastern Vermont and while I did a lot of weight lifting, I knew
little about calisthenics, running, or swimming. After becoming a lean
machine, I started bodybuilding during my medical training to get ready
for the field and tactics phase of training. I ate right, I slept well, I
pushed myself, and I did in fact gain a good deal of lean muscle mass. But
a few things happened when I did this. The first thing I noticed was that
I couldn’t run nearly as fast as I needed to and with big thighs, comes
lots of chafing. In combat, you do not have spandex to help you out. I
didn’t worry too much though. According to all the muscle magazines I was
strong as an ox and I was going to be able to kick some major butt in any
area of life.
That illusion faded after about the first 20 minutes in the field.
Master Sergeant Copper, a thin wiry guy strapped on his ruck, and we
followed suit. The packs weighed about 80lbs, sometimes more. Copper took
off like a bat out of hell. It was all we could do to keep up in the steep
mountains and high plateaus of New Mexico. According to the magazines I
should have smoked that old man! I had trained for five months for this
day and 20 minutes into it I faced the fact that it had all been a waste.
Fortunately for my ego I was not alone. The rest of the class who had done
some weight lifting and calisthenics was no better off. We were all in a
world of hurt. All the weight I gained and those awesome muscles that
turned women’s eyes vanished over the next couple months. I got skinny
again and adapted to my new role as a pack mule. It was a very difficult
time for me. I loved bodybuilding and I loved the gym. Muscle and Fitness
was my bible and I was faithful to it. Now what?
I spent the next 7 years trying to find the balance between lifting
weights and endurance. It seemed that guys who did power lifting were
always way too slow. They couldn’t run well with or with out a load and
they tired easily. Bodybuilders are notorious for collapsing in the field
because they have to be fed all the time, thus they are worthless. Runners
can’t carry heavy loads and neither can calisthenics gurus. We are truly
reinventing the wheel and with little success. Most operators have a
deep-set defense mechanism and they will accuse someone of being weak if
he admits that he feels he could be stronger. They say that they are good
to go and that you should get back in the gym. This
narrow-minded approach catches up with them eventually in the form of bad
backs and knees to name a few ailments. By then their attitude has shifted
and they have ruined their bodies. I am determined not to allow
that.
Last year I began a quest to find the Holy Grail of fitness. I knew it
was out there. It had to be. I was about to give up until one day I picked
up Muscle Media magazine and was introduced to Pavel Tsatsouline and
Dragon Door Publications. That day my life changed and a few months later
I had a set of Kettlebells, and a few months after that I was standing in
front of Pavel in his Kettlebell Instructor Certification Course. Life
hasn’t been the same since. I don’t have rippling muscles or anything. I
spend too much time on irregular sleep schedules and my diet is a mix of
anything I can get and MREs and lately I have been in the field a lot so I
get to work out only a few times a week if I am lucky. BUT, my functional
strength has gone through the roof. My legs, back, shoulders, abs, and
arms are functionally much stronger than they were. I have to laugh now
because on long patrols I see the young new guys suffering under the
weight of their packs while I feel fine. I watch as their strength is
sapped in the Florida heat and how they try to do anything they can to
shift the load. I laugh at their foolish bull headed insistence that they
know what they are doing and go to the gym more and only get weaker in the
field. They may physically look better, but their performance in the field
tells a different story. In the last couple months I have tested Pavel’s
training in all manner of special operations missions on land and in the
water. His knowledge and advice are worth his weight in diamonds. After
all, it was his job to make sure that the Spetsnaz were as strong as they
could possibly be. With Pavel at the helm, I’m glad I never had to fight
any of them!
A few weeks ago I stumbled on to a box of old books and regulations
that Master Sergeant Dave Young had left at the 41st RQS when
he retired. In that I found the old ARRSR 55-11 Volumes 1&2. I read
chapter 8 with amazement. Had we forgotten all that wisdom so soon?
Unfortunately yes we have.
Enter Mother Russia. A hard land filled with hard people. For you and
I, their research concerning physical culture is a gold mine. It may be
difficult to understand, but Mother Russia has done more than her fair
share of research in what I call "Human Potential". Many of us
remember Russia as the enemy, a cold war villain. These days we tend to
think of it as a poor and starving country, which may or may not be a
threat. Looking deeper at this society, we see a country with few frills
and little luxury that was determined to show the world what they were
made of. This took the form of sports and military might. This is
significant because unlike the US, Soviet government money poured in to
support research and development in the "Human Potential" arena. In the
US, sports training was left to a handful of coaches and relied on trial
and error. Literally reinventing the wheel. Very little money was given to
universities to study human potential. Here in the land of plenty we fell
behind.
In many ways, the Soviets failed in the military department. In some
ways they excelled. Did you know that every single unit had a gym? Even
submarines! Clearly they had some good direction. Can you imagine if every
company or squadron in the US military had a gym?
Russian sports have excelled in many areas. Hockey, wrestling, weight
lifting, swimming, etc… The Russians cleaned house in events involving
strength. The techniques they used from day one are only now being
discovered and touted as revolutions in fitness by the powerlifting
communities and in sports arenas such as the NFL, NHL, Soccer, and
basketball to name a few. Much of this is due to the work of Pavel
Tsatsouline and Coach John Davies (the secret weapon of many
winning sports teams today). What was their secret weapon of choice?
Kettlebells.
Kettlebells (KB) are a little intimidating at first. Shaped like a
cannonball with a handle attached, most people look at them and raise
their eyebrows. Some even laugh. Then they pick them up and find the
balance of a KB is just plain weird. They then try to look like its no big
thing and walk away quickly. Its lots of fun to watch. Kettlebell origins
are lost to history, but their track record is proven. The KB can be used
for a number of things. It is an awesome tool to improve your
cardiovascular fitness. It is common for your heart rate to hit 190-200BPM
during the ballistic lifts. When I first started I worked out attached to
a LifePak-10 and Pulse Oximeter just to confirm the fact. Its true! Many
KB lifters (Girevik) experience a 25BPM drop in the first 2 months of
their resting heart rate. With just a few reps you will be gasping for
breath so badly that you will have to stop. Be assured this is the
beginning to a hard but rewarding journey. With ballistic drills, your
strength endurance will skyrocket.
KBs are awesome for working the whole body. One unique way they do this
is through a very distorted placement of balance. The weight of a dumbbell
is well balanced. Not a KB! It is always off to one side or another. It’s
never quite right. It takes the whole body working together to actually
perform the lift. Another very important point is that a KB will never
allow you to daze off the way you can do through a set of leg curls or a
cardio work out. The instant that you divert your attention, the KB will
get your attention in a hurry and it may hurt like hell. Nothing gets your
attention faster than a 24kg KB on your foot or head. Thus you are
definitely training the mind as well as the body. Many articles in
magazines talk about using a concentrated mindset to improve your lifts. A
KB requires it; there is no choice in the matter.
KB lifting dramatically strengthens the tendons and ligaments of
your body. They also promote development of stabilizing muscles like
nothing else due to their balance. They are also superior for building
muscle because in all lifts, there is a greater load on the muscle
through out the full range of motion. A dumbbell or barbell curl drops
its load at the end of the rep, not so with a KB.
Kettlebell lifting will also build an iron core, strengthening your
back and legs at every turn. They are also superior in abdominal
development due to the required high-tension techniques.
Simple workouts with kettlebells lasting from 10-45 minutes will do
amazing things for your Strength, Endurance, Agility, and
Coordination. Because you are performing these movements and lifts
with weight you build all of the four combat fitness traits at the same
time. Specialization can be done, but seems unnecessary for the combat
soldier.
The fact is Kettlebells may well be the single most effective work out
tool in existence. They will allow you to become functionally stronger
than you have ever been, and prepare you for combat operations. It WILL
directly improve your ability to perform the 21 "Basic Physical
Skills" as well as ruck marching, swimming, etc…
To further emphasize this point, in 1983, a Soviet scientist named
Vorapeyev finished a multi-year study using the standard Soviet
Military PT test as the test criteria: Pull-ups, Standing Broad Jump,
100m Sprint, and 1k run. There were two groups tested. The first
trained specifically for these exercises and used the most modern
facilities. The second group used nothing but Kettlebells, an
ancient weight resembling a cannonball with a handle. Much to the
researchers’ surprise, the Kettlebell group always came out on top
by a long run! This despite the fact that they never trained
specifically for the tested exercises! More tests and studies were
done immediately testing grip strength, strength endurance, and three
powerlifts. They found that a Kettlebell lifter has far superior
strength-endurance and strength-coordination than other weight
lifting athletes. Further more, despite the fact that the KB group never
specifically trained for certain exercises they always came out on top
proving that Kettlebells better prepared the athlete for a full range
of activities.
This point was not lost on the military. They were ecstatic. Here was
an activity that would prepare the troops physically for anything they
faced in the field; and all with out expensive fancy gym equipment.
Immediately, all military units were outfitted with a full compliment
of Kettlebells.
The government’s discovery was nothing new to the Russian sporting
communities. Kettlebells had always been the primary strengthening tool of
athletes and they were put into legend by strongmen like Arthur Saxon and
Eugene Sandow. Nor was the Kettlebell unknown to the military. There is an
official military KB competition every year, and the soviet airborne
and special operations units have always used them.
In the early 90’s, a Soviet Spetsnaz Drill Instructor immigrated to the
USA and became a revolution by himself. A nationally ranked Kettlebell
lifter with a degree in Physical Culture, Pavel Tsatsouline has
been spreading this priceless training around the country developing a
following of amazingly dedicated and powerful students. I had the great
pleasure of training with this man, and I am now a Certified Kettlebell
Instructor. It is with this knowledge I now possess, that I will now talk
to you about incorporating Kettlebells and high-tension techniques into
your workouts resulting in enhanced sports performance and true Combat
Fitness.
Kettlebells for Combat Fitness
Bodybuilding won’t help you in the field. Powerlifting has some
benefits. Olympic Lifting has more benefits than strict powerlifting.
Kettlebell lifting directly benefits every single activity that special
operations soldiers engage in.
I have explained that they build superior cardiovascular endurance,
strength endurance, strength coordination, tendon and ligament strength,
and mind-body coordination. But how do you work them into your daily
PT?
First you have to buy a set. I won’t lie. They are expensive. Once you
have them and get used to them you will never look back. They are only
available at along with the books and
tapes from Pavel Tsatsouline, which explain everything I have, but in
greater detail.
Next, get rid of your current routine! Replace it with joint mobility
exercises when you wake up. Doing so will remove the need to "warm up"
which is a silly idea for a soldier in the first place. If you think that
a cave man warmed up before he ran down a deer you are sadly
mistaken!
Then begin a combination of bodyweight exercises and Kettlebells. For
example, do the following exercises for your Monday morning work out: Jump
rope, Windmills (KB), 1 arm push ups, Military press, 1 leg squats, Pull
ups, and KB snatches.
After much progress in these or other exercises spelled out by Pavel,
be sure to begin to gravitate towards a strong core. You do this by
working in exercises that work the legs, back, and abs. Perhaps by doing
more squatting lifts, deadlifts, pull-ups, and Janda sit-ups.
When your core has reached great strength, now you can begin to get
really serious! Advanced lifts like the Bent Press and the Two Hands
Anyhow will challenge you in new ways. Increase the number of reps in
ballistic lifts like the Snatch. Try for 50 reps per arm with 24Kg! As you
begin these new trials of strength and endurance you will become something
of a machine in the field. Rarely tiring and able to go on like that damn
pink bunny in the old Energizer commercials.
What about Running and Swimming? Do not stop doing these
activities, but be sure to follow these two rules:
Here are some more guidelines for working out with or with out
Kettlebells.
The authors of ARRSR 55-11 obviously did their homework. The
"Strength Circuit Conditioning" section provides the following
guidance. My comments are in parentheses.
-Be sure to warm up and cool down before and after
exercising. (Use
joint mobility exercises to "warm up". Use walking and light stretching to
"cool down")
-A circuit is a circle of men who perform the exercises
together.
-Each member will take a turn deciding what the next exercise will be.
For example, after a set of pushups, the next man to the right will choose
the next exercise and reps.
-Vigorously accomplish low reps of each exercise. (Excellent!)
-Do multiple repetitions of the circuit.
(Be sure to do the same exercises for
each circuit, i.e. C1-Pushups, pull-ups, Janda sit-ups, Military press.
C2-Repeat C1)
-There are no set exercises you have to use for each
circuit. (Variety is essential, but do not vary too much from day to day.
Have some core exercises that make up ¾ of the circuit an ¼ is anything
the team wants. Feel free to vary the order each day or even each
circuit)
-The interval between exercises should be two minutes or
less. (Yes, for
soldiers who must build their recovery capability. Be sure to walk around
during this rest interval to assist your body’s
recovery)
-Not every man will be able to complete the workout. Some may only be
able to do two full circuits while other will be able to do five or more.
Regardless, everyone will get the maximum benefit from this type of
training.
-Normally five complete circuits will
be completed in 30-45 min. (Excellent, notice the time does not exceed 45
minutes. More than this results in Neurological decline and
injury)
-Rarely exceed 25 reps per
exercise. (Excellent for exercises like push-ups. For 1 leg squats and
similar difficult exercises, do no more than 5 reps. For ballistic lifts
like snatches, there is no limit)
The same guidance applies to Kettlebells. Some additional guidance is
required though.
More tips for Kettlebells:
-For pure strength, rest longer between exercises.
-For endurance, shorten your rest.
-For Muscular endurance, meet in the middle.
-For military personnel warming up is not exactly required. You should
perform a Super Joints circuit when you wake up. That is more than enough.
On the battlefield, you will not have the opportunity to warm up.
-Do not exceed 45 minutes per workout. In the beginning you will be
wiped out in 5-10 minutes. More than 45 minutes and you have reached a
point of diminishing returns.
As you can see, Kettlebells fit in perfectly with team PT. If you
follow the model given to us in ARRSR 55-11 you can successfully run a fun
and challenging PT session anytime. For variety you can choose to do just
calisthenics from time to time and once a week the team should run an
obstacle course and/or conduct a road march for time (I prefer the idea of
a road march once a month when you are doing a lot of KB work). When it
comes to large teams, break down the team so you have two or more circuits
going at the same time. The optimum number of men per circuit is 10. If
you have 20 or more, obviously you will have to restrict the number of
people who get to name exercises. Too many exercises will take you over
the 45-minute time schedule. Be creative and use variety.
A good NCO or Commander will also see the value of Kettlebells from a
deployment standpoint. I have been in forward areas many times with
inadequate gym facilities and we were forced to improvise. It never worked
out quite right. Kettlebells on the other hand are the perfect forward
area workout tools. All you need is a couple KBs of different weights
and you will always have the ability to work out effectively in any place.
You don’t need any more space than a broom closet or a small patch of
outdoors. They take up next to no space in the ISU-90 and you can keep
them in a corner or under a table in the tent. How could it get any
better?
I hope by now you see and understand the amazing versatility of
Kettlebells. I have given you history, scientific studies, US and Soviet
workout tips, and explanation on why the Kettlebell is the best combat
fitness and conditioning tool available. Dare to break a few so-called
rules, get back to the basics, and start living and thriving again with
this amazing tool. ENJOY!

The best way to have an abundant bountiful vegetable garden is to keep your free-ranging chickens entirely out of it. Keep it enclosed, fenced off, and out of bounds. Don’t grow vegetables amongst free-ranging chicken, because of the remote possibility of sickness and disease such as salmonella.
Low-height vegetables should be off limits to free-ranging chickens because 1) they will eat them all, and 2) if fresh chicken manure comes in contact with these vegetables, anyone who eats them could become violently ill.
Here are some points for keeping chickens out of your vegetable garden:
Create an enclosure or zone surrounding your vegetable garden. Keep your chickens out of that zone during the entire growing season, until the garden is spent. Using a mobile tractor, place your chickens over your finished vegetable garden to clean it up, aerate it, eat any insects and bugs, and fertilize it with their manure.
When your chickens are finished, move them out of the vegetable garden zone. If you have a potager, tractor your chickens on the plot that you’ll next leave dormant, and then move your chickens to another zone.
Grow vegetables, especially ornamental vegetables, interspersed with other plant layers throughout your chicken garden for design and for your chickens, but not for your consumption.
Grow vegetables for human consumption in an entirely different part of your property, such as the front yard, where your chickens never free-range.The Question of Dual?”
He looked her in the eye and deadpanned, "I’m protesting dualism.” She ran away.
Fr. Julian Carron says that dualism leads to nihilism. I think that what he is getting at is that dualism denies the religious sense. By religious sense, I mean the seeming innate ability for human being to sense the existence of a higher power. And, by dualism, I understand that Fr. Carron means the post-Cartesian, post-modern dualism.
Let’s first put this in perspective. Most of the thought of Western civilization is dualistic. Platonism and neo-Platonism are very dualistic. The Manicheans were notoriously dualistic, far more than the Greeks. As a matter of fact, in definitions of dualism in various encyclopedias and websites, the example often given is Manichaeanism.
Although Augustine vigorously rejected all of the Manichaean doctrines, he retained a latent-Manichaean and strongly dualistic perspective on reality.
I saw the History channel documentary titled Sex and the Bible. A surprise to me, I thought it was very good—informative and thought provoking, with seemingly no ideological agenda. The commentators were all women seminary or college professors. They were respectful of Augustine but gently and firmly critical of his dualism. One said that the extreme dualism between body and soul found in Augustine is not Biblically justified. I am unaware of any reason to disagree. It goes without saying that Christians should be as Biblically grounded as possible and that is something that Augustine himself would agree with whole-heartedly.
Another perspective on this is that some of the Greek Bishops and thinkers that were contemporary with the converted Augustine considered him to be not much more than a Manichaean in Christian clothing. To be fair, I think some of this attitude was simply based on suspicion from his Manichaean days, as much as anything else. Also, to be fair and balanced, it should be pointed out that throughout his service as a bishop, Augustine was continually fighting major heresies; yet, he never once got into a conflict over doctrine with his Greek contemporaries.
One Orthodox person today expressed it to me that they do not consider Augustine’s conversion to have been complete. Of course they accept Augustine’s confession, experience of being born again, profession of faith and Baptism as valid. Their complaint is that he did not fully purge himself of his extremely dualistic worldview. One might discount some of this attitude as resulting from cultural differences and associated overtones of suspicion and paranoia between the Latin and Greek Church. However, the Greek speaking Christian thinkers had previously had to deal with the issue of dualism coming from Greek philosophy. I have been told they rejected the dualism from Greek philosophy that was not consistent with Christianity. I take it on face value that the Greeks know non-Christian dualism when they see it. I have the great respect for Orthodox thought, and in this case I side with the Orthodox in their indictment of Augustine’s dualism.
I hope, and prefer to think, that the attitudes and beliefs expressed by Msgr. Lorenzo Albacete and Fr. Julian Carron represent the trend of orthodox, contemporary Roman Catholic thought. Thankfully, it does appear that Roman Catholic thought today is more grounded in the Bible than ever before.

There’s a certain vaudevillian flair to all his work, but it’s the sort of vaudeville that powers the absurdist despair of Samuel Beckett’s Waiting For Godot; one-liners and gags are just another way to deal with the inevitability of death. The difference is, there’s a core of faith and optimism at the heart of Blatty’s writing. Horror exists, as do evil and the monsters who perpetrate it, but there’s also God in his heaven, purpose, and at least the possibility of justice. Crazy strips away the unpleasantness; what little suspense there is comes from the fantastical mystery at the story’s core. It’s cheery, and not much else.
The main problem is that as a novel, Crazy makes a pretty good short story. It contains all the ingredients of a longer book: Joey El Bueno, a screenwriter whiling away his days in a nursing home, is writing his memoirs, sort of. Instead of telling the story of his life, he’s reliving certain key moments of his childhood in 1941 New York. His father is a hard-working single parent with a soft heart, and Joey’s pals are a comically exaggerated lot, although few of them stand out clearly. Of those, the most important—really, the only important—is Jane Bent, a baffling freckled girl who indulges in moral advice and the occasional act of magic. Unsure who Jane is, or if she’s anyone at all, Joey remembers when she came into his life, and how that changed his world.
Which is all well and good. The problem is that Blatty never focuses on any subject long enough to give any of this much weight beyond the occasional punchline. Joey’s narration, with its endlessly digressive sentences, is entertaining, but it short-circuits any attempts at creating a sense of place. Characters move in and out of view as though their names were sufficient to make them interesting. There’s no depth to the tale—for all the time-jumping, this moves in a straight line to a heartwarming, slightly hollow conclusion. If Crazy were shorter, the lack of coherency might’ve been charming; longer, and the scenes might’ve connected more. As is, it’s a diversion that’s never more than slight.After spending nearly a decade behind bars, Ryan Ferguson's fate is in the hands of the Western District Court of Appeals in Kansas City, Mo.
The appellate court heard arguments from both the state and Ferguson's defense team Tuesday.
Ferguson, 28, and his friend, Charles Erickson, were both charged with robbing and killing Columbia Daily Tribune sports editor Kent Heitholt as he left work on Halloween night 2001.
Erickson accepted a plea deal and testified that he and Ferguson committed the crime together for drinking money.
Ferguson was convicted of second-degree murder and robbery in 2005 and sentenced to 40 years in prison.
He has maintained his innocence the entire time.
His attorney, Kathleen Zellner, says there is no physical evidence connecting Ferguson to the crime.
In January, Ferguson's legal team filed a writ of habeas corpus, meaning his team believes he is being held on insufficient evidence.
"This was a case that was built on the testimony of two eyewitnesses and they both admitted perjury at Ryan Ferguson's trial," Zellner told ABC News. "So there's no evidence left.".
During Tuesday's hearing, attorneys received 15 minutes to argue Ferguson's case then the state's attorneys argued their side for 15 minutes. Ferguson's legal team then got a five minute rebuttal.
The judges heard about the witnesses recanting their testimonies as well as Brady violations, where the prosecution doesn't provide information to the defense before trial.
Both Zellner and Ferguson's father, Bill Ferguson, told ABC 17 News Tuesday that they are extremely encouraged by the judge's knowledge of the case and the line of questioning during Tuesday's oral arguments.
"The judges came in prepared and asked good questions of the attorney general who wasn't prepared to give good, valid answers," said Bill Ferguson. "I'd say it was a bad day for the attorney general and a good day for Ryan."
Depending on the outcome from the Western District Court of Appeals, Ferguson could be granted a bail amount. That means he could walk out of prison within weeks.
Support to free Ferguson has gained momentum in recent years. Currently, there are more than 56,000 followers of the "Free Ryan Ferguson" Facebook page.
His case has also garnered national attention, with several network television specials.
Ferguson's father is also planning to tour in a vehicle wrapped with Ryan's photo and the slogan "Wrongfully Convicted. Time for Justice." to spread awareness.Wildgame Innovation Bucker Up Ripe 'N' Apple Deer Attractant is the Ultimate Deer Attractant Supplement!

It's not a fancy place, but it's definitely the place where to get a healthy and filling meal on a fair price.
Cons: No Fruit Juices
It's not a fancy place, but it's definitely the place where to get a healthy and filling meal on a fair price.
I had an eggplant salad, TVP in tomato sauce and a coconut date ball for dessert. None of it was spiced with curry and it was all delicious and cheap. Plenty of vegan options, too.
Rama is mainly offering vegetarian options. Almost everything using Indian spices and flavours.
The taste is fine, however, since I value health over taste(for ex. no fried food goes down to my tummy) there is almost nothing left to choose from.
The place definitely has some interesting wibe, though, you get very little for moderate price.
They have a happy hour that begins at 7PM and you can get a discount on all the food then. However, by that time most of the food is gone and there are only limited options, so it is only recommended if you are not very picky. The nice thing about this place is they have Latvian vegetarian choices such as vegetarian pelmeni, mushrooms, Latvian soups, etc. On weekdays, you can sit on the second floor and it is much less crowded than the first floor. If you want to eat dinner here, I recommend you go at around 5PM so you still have a lot of food options.
A big plus is that they are open on Sun.
Don't visit this location if you think, it is important to feel 100% welcome. The staff was a bit rude and not able or in the mood to speak English. The obviously religious background gave me the creeps. On my walk to the dirty and only toilet I got lost, so my walk ended in front of a huge and ugly altar, or something like that.
But I also have to say that the food was really good. We found a buffet with a wide range of mainly vegan food and it was very cleary labeled, if the food was vegan or just vegetarian.
If I find myself in Riga ever again, a second visit at Rama would be guaranteed, because it is simply not very easy to find a restaurant with vegan dishes in Latvia.
4 cow heads for a veg. restaurant in Latvia, means 3 cow heads for a location like Rama in Berlin, Vienna or Stockholm.
By the way: You can over-fill your belly for about 5 Euro there.
I thought it was just fine. No linen tablecloths and candles, but a good variety of appetizing veg foods at modest prices. Bright, clean cafeteria-style operation, offering a good selection of hot and cold foods: mains, salads, desserts, drinks. Best veg food in town! Served by competent Krishna womenfolk. A distance from city center, on Barona near Gertrudes, but streetcars 6 and 11 from center go right by it for 70 centimes. I'm going back!
Rama is a good value if you want a meal at a good price, but I was disappointed by the food. I found it band and uninteresting.
...!
Good and healthy food (the coco burgers are some of the greatest ever), cheap price.
We ended up going back several times during our time in Riga. The food was of very high quality, served cafeteria style. the value for money is the best I have ever experienced. It is however somewhere to eat rather than somewhere for a Romantic meal..
I haven't been myself but a friend who has been told me the following by email:-
"I went to this Rama healthy food place!!! Fantastic!!! food was lovely! I'll be
going back one day soon."
The emphasis isn't on ambience or mood lighting and the staff aren't the most helpful ever encountered but for cheap plentiful (mostly) vegan food you won't find much better in Riga. If you have a vegan passport it may be helpful in Rama as I struggled to explain veganism without it! Everything's priced item by item and is all very very cheap and for a good cause. Especially recommend the homemade ginger tea!
There is a small section for vegans. The staff speaks English and there is a little shop below the restaurant where some cruelty-free products are.- Scrolling Banner Code?

A career Hotelier, Julian always ensures his Guests are well looked after!
Julian Brackenbury purchased this villa in 2007
Private, well equipped, lovely location. Many unique added features not seen in other rental properties.
Golf course, private pool, not overlooked.
We stayed June/July 09. This was our first Rental Home and we were concerned wether this would be as described. Or if there would be any unexpected charges. Melrose Villa is exactly what they say it is. Clean, quiet, a good supply of linens and a well equipped kitchen.
I was in contact mutiple times with the owner before our trip asking questions. My questions were all answered promptly and fully.
I would recommend this property and already have to my friends. When we go back to Florida I plan stay here again.
Lovely place, stayed with 2 children. Great villa, lovely touches like toy box, books and films. Lovely golf course walks too.
My expectations were high on returning to Florida after 18 years and I was not disappointed. Southern Dunes resort was well looked after, very clean and had security gates which made us feel safe and secure. The villa was just as described, very spacious and clean. It had everything we needed for catering at home and lots of towels, bed sheets, and amenities. The management company were great, on hand instantly and Gill and Ted were very friendly and helpful.
We had a brilliant holiday and would go back tomorrow if we could!
Would recommend Mannys Chop House which is down the road from the resort, book early as it is always busy.
Melrose Villa is very private and is not overlooked by other homes.
The pool area is small . The website states that the villa has a safe , but it doesn't . The en-suite bathroom is small , no seperate shower room. The villa is clean and has all the kitchen & laundry facilities that you expect . Walmart is at the entrance to the gated community .
Manny's Chophouse is a must when eating out : the best value for money ever . Southern Dunes golf course is very expensive compared to others locally , although it is always in great condition.
The villa is good value for money .
Just returned from renting this villa for the month of Feb. 2011 and even before unpacking my bags I contacted the owner to see about booking it again for next Feb. The Villa is exactly as described and has everything one would need. It is located in a beautiful golf community (I'm already missing my morning walks) with one of the most beautiful courses I have ever played.
The property was very clean and well maintained with many restaurants (don't miss Manny's Chop House) and grocery stores close by. Both the owner and the property management company are very pleasant and easy to deal with. Any questions I had were answered promptly and to my complete satisfaction. The central Fla. location (20 min. to Disney) puts you close to more places than you'll have time to visit.
I think the fact that I'm so anxious to book it again tells you all you need to know.
This villa was perfect for my family. It was just like home. There even was a crib for my baby, that I didn´t know about before we arrived. We´ll stay here next time we´re in Florida.
Close to Disney, Universal, Sea World, Haines City, Davenport, Universal and International Drive. Situated on a world-class Golf Course at Southern Dunes. Located close by are various restaurants, bars and convenience stores, including a Wal-Mart supermarket less than 5 minutes drive away!

New window blinds fitted and new flat screen TV's in master and second bedroom. Master bed TV has computer connections. Massage shower head fitted in master en suite. The facilities at Melrose Villa are premium!!

then a building should be able to as well. The Marriott Hotel chain purchased the Clarion Hotel in the Gaslamp, rebranded it, and called in the nip/tuk
specialists to give the old lady a makeover - and what a job they did. The reconstruction resulted in a world-class hotel with an incredible ambiance.
Everything about the place exudes warmth, relaxation, comfort and class. The rooms are cozy. The furniture blends together. There is a sense of belonging
and symmetry. Feng Shui.
With the dramatic resurgence of downtown San Diego, a project such as the Marriott Gaslamp Quarter is seen as just another upgrade to the area. It wasn't many years ago that the Gaslamp was seedy with a few restaurants, many many
parking lots and a completely uninviting warehouse district that was home to winos and street people.
Slowly but surely the Gaslamp developed into a hip entertainment center and one by one the parking lots were replaced by construction cranes building a new infrastructure of swanky hotels and trendy retail shops...and more restaurants. The crown jewel of this renaissance is the San Diego Marriott Gaslamp Quarter.
The catalyst to the transformation was the construction of the San Diego Convention Center. The completion was the building of the San Diego Padres
new home, Petco Park, right in the heart of the Gaslamp. The warehouses were razed and the newly cleared area made way for the construction of the stadium.
No more baseball at an NFL stadium, now the Padres had their own park. It was
an instant success with people being able to take the trolley, get to the Gaslamp early, have dinner and enjoy the game. The stadium is a gem, and
even though its brand new, it feels like it's been there forever, ala Chicago's Wrigley Field.
The Marriott is right next door. It is the place to stay, and as an added attraction, it has a rooftop bar, called Altitude, where you can get a bird's eye view of the game and enjoy food and drink. And party hardy after the game. Life is good!
Altitude - Night and Day Home to the hottest club in San Diego, Altitude is at the very top of the Marriott Gaslamp. It provides a bird's eye view of the Padres when they play at Petco Park.
To top things off, the games are broadcast on big screen HDTV's. When the game is over Altitude remains a networking action spot. The DJ spins, the fire pits blaze and the eye-candy strut their stuff. It's casual. It's elegant. Dresses or t-shirts are the order of the day because anything goes.
Two bars serve specialized drinks and there's a handy supply of beach blankets in case it gets too chilly. The blankets are welcome on certain nights because it can get cool in San Diego. An express elevator goes directly to Altitude but the lines are long, especially on weekends. Guests can use their key card for access from the other three elevators - a nice advantage.
The completely refurbished lobby welcomes guests. There is a convenience shop
stocked with necessities to take along to the game directly across the street.
Fresh flowers add warmth. The check-in desk has three giant bowls of candy...nice! Everything is new, hip and coordinated. Guest rooms are comfy, bright and luxurious. An abundance of natural light enhances the mood. The
views of the bay and the water just put you in good spirits. The Soleil@K restaurant at street level has a bistro-like atmosphere..Latest News

In a very disturbing month where several of our Black Media Icons have been given the boot by Corporate America, I think we all should look into what is the bigger plan as these strategic moves are being made in the manner of a controlled demolition.
In one of my earlier articles I quoted comedian/talk show host/author/actor Steve Harvey when he stated that “Hollywood is MORE racist than America.”
So with not only the cancellation of The Michael Baisden Show, which is at the height of its popularity, but with the firing from CNN of Soledad O’Brien, Donna Brazile & Roland Martin, along with the public lynching/character assassination of the righteously outspoken Boston Talk Show Host Warren Ballentine, one has to ask oneself “are strong Black influential voices now on the hitlist?
Why is this happening and WHO is NEXT?
…….this is a discussion that I believe is LONG overdue!
Time: Saturday March 23,.When it comes to perfume, I have two fears: one is smelling like a grandma and the other is overdoing it. I like scents that are clean, slightly floral and have a musky undertone. Not sure if that even makes sense but let’s go with it shall we? My go-to perfumes of late have been Flowerbomb by Victor & Rolf (love this!), and Pure Grace by Philosophy (reviewed here). There’s a third that’s now in my regular rotation: Balenciaga’s Florabotanica*, which launched last fall.Continue ReadingNow that Tila Tequila is done looking for love, what's keeping her busy? Her new girlfriend Courtenay Semel! Tila and Courtenay made a cameo at the 944 second anniversary party Wednesday night, where they stopped to talk to Hollyscoop about their relationship.
What was it about Courtenay that made Tila stop looking for love? "For the show I did two seasons back to back and everything kind of forced. Eliminating all these people, always looking for love, I was like, 'I'm so over this' then she walked into my life. It was like a fresh of breath air," said Tila.
Courtenay, who proudly showed off a 'Be With Me Always' necklace she received from Tila during a recent trip to Tokyo, says she doesn't get jealous when other men hit on her girlfriend. "She knows I wouldn't really bother," added Tila.
So is there love for real? Their chemistry speaks for itself, but you can watch our exclusive video below and judge for yourself.I don’t talk about cosmetics but the other day I was looking at my empty bottle of Eudermine and I couldn’t resist showing it to you. Eudermine was released in 1893 and it marked Shiseido’s move from pharmaceuticals to cosmetics. It is a Revitalising Lotion and according to Wikipedia it was formulated as a treatment to remove lead residue from skin as Japanese women used white lead based powder to create a porcelain effect in their makeup. Contrarily to its formula portfolio Eudermine is soft as silk and a real panacea for skin. With the slightest hint of extra stress in my life my skin breaks with read spots and dry spots. Eudermine normalizes every irregularity with its thick, gelatinous consistency. It doesn’t contain alcohol and leaves my skin feeling clean, cool and balanced. Since 1893 the formula has allegedly stayed the same but it has changed its packaging several times. The current bottle was designed in 1997 by Serge Lutens to celebrate more than 100 years in the market. It is a minimalistic red flacon with a small spherical cap. The name is written on the label using a very angular font very close to the one currently used for Serge Lutens L’Eau Serge Lutens and L’Eau Froide and Serge Lutens logo but in a symmetrically mirrored coupling of the letters that makes them look like Japanese ideograms. The bottle looks is an evolution of the Serge Lutens 50ml bottles and it shows the same disrespect to practicality as the bell bottles: the cap is a delicate sphere that just slips into the neck of the bottle. It is not a screw cap which means that you cannot travel with it! In its latest incarnation Eudermine is the perfect example of western marketing ideas transfused to Japan, dressed in Japanese simplicity, polished to perfection by the eclectic taste of Serge Lutens and recirculated to the west. The quality of the product is phenomenal. This bottle is simply too beautiful to be just a lotion!
This work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivs 3.0 Unported License.
Truly gorgeous–both the bottle and the image! And what a history–I had no idea!
The esthetics of Shiseido have always been amazing. Serge Lutens helped while he was artistic director but he also fitted in to a company that already had a vision. And it also helps to know that what is inside the bottle is also very good.
The image here is original.
My face lives on Shiseido from moisturizer to shaving cream. Love it! That bottle is incredible, but I haven’t really paid attention to the perfume. I guess I need to give it a sniff next time I’m at the store.
Please don’t, its completely odourless! :)
It is just a very good product for your face in a very beautiful bottle.
Wow, you make me want to plunk down some money for a bottle pronto. Probably won’t, though, as usually most skin products that people rave about make my (very oily) skin break out. :(
Oh, I forgot to mention, I have oily patches too! It’s like a war field on my face when I stress :)
I like Shiseido and use many of their product. Actually, my vSO refuses to use anything for washing his face other than Benefiance Extra Creamy Cleansing Foam.
I should definitely try Eudermine. (Loved the title! :) )
Shiseido products are not cheap but still they are incredible value for money. They seem to always manage to perform better than the competition.
The title somehow manages to be relevant every now and then :)
I do not know prices for Shiseido in your country but where I live this is the line closer to the bottom of the department store brands range. That’s why I like it :)
Eudermine must be around 50 euro nowadays! Damn euro exchange rates!T 1.78% PremixThis treatment applies to the following species:

"For the successful financing of an NPP, technological, political (both domestic and international), reputational and economic issues must be dealt with in a holistic manner, whereby the financing entities must be able to answer the question 'Is this a good project?'"
David Coull of Bell Gully takes an in-depth look at the impact of recent regulatory reforms in New Zealand's exploration and production industry:
"Since 2009, the New Zealand government has actively focused on promoting and enabling the local oil and gas industry, undertaking a series of changes designed to help the industry grow, including by attracting new international investors into the sector."
Uwe M Erling of Noerr, Douglas Glass of Akin Gump Strauss Hauer & Feld, Angus Jones of Allen & Overy, Mathew Kidwell of Morgan Lewis & Bockius, Paul Murphy of Milbank Tweed Hadley & McCloy and Craig Spurn of McCarthy Tetrault discuss the volume of transactional work, regulatory developments, the impact of major energy disasters and changes to the legal market in their jurisdictions.
This year we single out 634 practitioners from 283 firms who are considered leading experts in energy law. Global giant Dentons leads the way in our research with lawyers from 13 of its offices around the globe selected. Baker Botts performs very strongly with its Houston office a hub of activity; following closely behind is international heavyweight Norton Rose Fulbright. Several other firms, including Herbert Smith Freehills, Vinson & Elkins and Morgan Lewis & Bockius, perform impressively.
We also highlight the leading lawyers in the world by region: North America, Europe, Latin America, Asia-Pacific and the Middle East and Africa.
With the continuing shale boom in North America and its emergence in other jurisdictions, the busy renewables sector, and nuclear work returning post-Fukushima, the past year has been a busy one for energy lawyers. One source described the sector as “almost recession-proof”; given the growing legal market it seems the majority of firms agree. We have heard reports of burgeoning practices in key energy hubs, notably Texas, London, Johannesburg and Rio de Janeiro, which have all seen more entrants into the market over the past few years.
In this section we single out the 11 best-represented firms and 10 most highly regarded individuals in our research overall.
Norton Rose Fulbright leads our research with 27 representatives from its offices around the globe. The recent merger of two "first-class" firms in this area elevates this newly formed entity to the top of our research. Dentons is another recently combined firm to perform well this year and it has 24 lawyers from across Asia, Europe and the US selected for inclusion. Leading energy firm Baker Botts follows closely behind with 22 listings, and Herbert Smith Freehills and Morgan Lewis & Bockius both have 19 "top practitioners" singled out in this publication.
For the first time since its inception in 2005, The International Who’s Who of Oil and Gas Lawyers has expanded its remit beyond oil and gas to include lawyers in the nuclear energy, renewables and power sectors. Having conducted hundreds of hours of interviews with private practitioners and in-house counsel, we whittled the list down to just over 600 individuals in 74 countries, from Algeria to Vietnam. Compiling the observations from all the people we spoke to, Who’s Who Legal takes a look at the key developments across the energy legal market over the past year.
Benefiting from over 15 years of independent research, comprising hundreds of hours of interviews with the leading private practitioners and in-house teams around the world, Who’s Who Legal assesses the past 12 months in the international oil and gas legal market.
In this section we analyse the findings of our research in greater depth to identify the firms and practitioners who stand out worldwide...Ever since T-Mobile announced the Samsung Galaxy S II back in August, the phone has remained shrouded in mystery. The first sign came when T-Mobile had the phone behind glass and refused to give out any specifics about specs or a release date only saying that it would be out this fall and that it would have a 4.2-inch display with a dual-core processor.
We theorized that the lack of details probably had something to do with the phone’s processor and it seems like we have our confirmation today. Yesterday, we learned that T-Mobile’s Galaxy S II would not have the same chip as the AT&T and Sprint models and Samsung’s Galaxy S support account has confirmed that the device has a 1.5 GHz dual core Qualcomm APQ8060 processor.
The processor that was heavily rumored to be under the hood.
You see, the AT&T and Sprint variants both employ a 1.2GHz Exynos processor from Samsung, a processor that doesn’t support HSPA+ 42mpbs speeds. And if you recall, T-Mobile’s Galaxy S II has been rumored to be compatible with T-Mobile’s 42Mpbs HSPA+ network.
Qualcomm’s processor is compatible with the MDM8220 modem, the Exynos processor is not. Now, that doesn’t necessarily mean that 42Mpbs HSPA+ is 100% certain, it’s not, but it’s definitely a good sign.
Now all we need is a release date and a full spec sheet.Definitions for unlaugh

Congratulations to Exercise Physiology student from the School of Exercise, Biomedical and Health Sciences, Greg Levin, who was one of the recipients of the inaugural Cancer Council Western Australia top-up Ancillary PhD Scholarships, which supports the work of promising young PhD students with a research interest in cancer.
The scholarship, which is worth $12,000 and goes on top of his existing Australian Postgraduate Award (APA), will allow Greg to conduct research into the effects of exercise on the mental health and quality of life of cancer survivors, and is part of $2.1 million in research funding announced by the Cancer Council last week.
Greg is currently working with the team at ECU’s Health and Wellness Institute, and hopes to understand why and how cancer survivors experience a boost in self-esteem and quality-of-life when they combine exercise with their treatments.
“The fact I now have University and Cancer Council backing to undertake my PhD study is a real positive,” said Greg.
“This funding has given me added incentive to work as hard as I can with my project and ultimately contribute to the growing body of evidence about the benefits of exercise for cancer survivors."

Groupset is the name for the collective group of parts on the bike covering transmission, gearing and braking. Each groupset is created to suit a certain style of riding and grouped into a range with matching gears, brakes, transmission and wheels. They are categorised by name with all the new innovation coming in at the top then trickling down several layers in following years. Today’s mid-price groupsets have features which were only available to professional riders several years ago albeit with only a slight weight gain as you move down the hierarchy of groupsets being the only penalty.
Components include: bottom bracket, brake callipers, brake discs, brake levers, cables, cassette, chain, chainset, gear levers, front and rear mech (derailleur), hubs, pedals and wheels – although pedals, hubs and wheels are rarely included in groupset sales.
Shimano is the biggest bicycle component manufacturer in the world. The Japanese company makes groupsets for road, mountain, trekking and leisure bikes meaning they have a product suitable for almost any kind of bike.
Shimano off-road groupsets are categorised by discipline and hierarchy groupsets from professional to entry level is as follows:

I started scrapbooking back in 1997, but really just hoarded supplies until a few years ago when I reconnected with a old friend from Jr. High. Once we realized we both had papercrafting in common, my love for papercrafts was rekindled and I've been obsessed ever since! I am a Graphic Designer at my 'day job,' so I love coming home and getting inky instead of staring at a computer screen.
Hi, I'm Nette! I live in Indianapolis with my sweet husband Carlin. We are active in our church, and love the Indianapolis Colts. I’ve always had a love for all sorts of crafts. Paper-crafting, specifically card making is a passion of mine. It’s so nice to know that someone’s day will be brightened when they open their mailbox and find something besides bills and junk-mail. I love Lawn Fawn stamps, so being part of the Lawnscaping Design Team gives me another reason to break out these fun and whimsical stamps. This challenge blog is unique in that each challenge is different but all are loads of fun. Please visit my blog!
Hi, I'm Karin. I’m from Gothenburg, Sweden where I live with my husband and our sweet 3-year-old son. I have been doing arts and crafts, sewing, drawing, water color painting, paper crafting etc. for as long as I can remember, so it was no surprise that I chose that path for my career and studied arts and crafts with a focus on textiles for 5 years at Gothenburg university. I have how now been teaching textile crafts and language full time (45 h/week) at Ytterby Highschool; 7-9grade, for 15 years. I LOVE my students and my job but always wish I had more time for paper crafting (-: . I adore Kelly's cute Lawn Fawn images and I am super excited to be on the Lawnscaping team!

Hi, my name is Tamara. I live in Holland, in a small town called “Hoogkarspel." I was born in Bovenkarspel, a small town 10 minutes away from here, but we moved to Hoogkarspel when I was eight years old. My parents and sister live nearby. I love animals, cuteness, photography (addicted to Instagram), my Phone, computers and music. I work as a pain nurse in a hospital four days a week. In my free time I love to craft, photograph, walk with my Yorkie girl, listen to Music and watch TV. I’ve been crafting for 3 years now, love to make layouts of all my Instagram photo’s but I also love making cards. I describe my style as CAS & cute. Less is more.... I love Ranger Distress, Jenni Bowlin, and Hero Arts inks. My favorite tools are my Silhouette, Crop-a-dile corner chomper, slice, and Cuttlebug. I love everything about LAWN FAWN and penny black, Hero arts and Waltzing mouse stamps. I’m very proud being part of the Lawnscaping design team. Love challenges
Hi, my name is Elise and I live in State College, PA with my wonderful husband. I currently work as a bank teller and I am also very involved in my church. I started making cards shortly after getting married four years ago when my mother-in-law gave me a Cricut. I have since become passionate for stamping. Please visit my blog at

Fighter Model Used In Star Wars: A New Hope On eBay, More Than You Can Afford

Unfortunately, the little thing is only 18" H x 14" W, so there goes using it as a treehouse. So, what can one expect to pay for such a diminutive T.I.E. Fighter? How about $170,000? Yeah. There's never been a better time to kidnap, extort, blackmail, and/or auction your hitman services. I'll start by knocking off The Superficial Writer. Do I hear $10? $5? $1? 2-for-1 Whopper card?

Thanks Johnathan, you know anything about robbing banks?For British-born actress Minnie Driver, her break in movies came in 1995 when she was cast to portray the central character in “Circle of Friends,” an Irish schoolgirl named Benny Hogan. It was a role that required her to put on 25 pounds and to put on hold another talent she had been nurturing since childhood.
“I was in a band, we were signed to Island Records. We didn’t even have a name yet when I got cast in ‘Circle of Friends’ and my life took a bit of a different turn,” said the actress during a phone interview to discuss her one-night concert in Hermosa Beach.
The Thursday night show at Saint Rocke is in support of Driver’s upcoming cover album “Ask Me to Dance,” a collection of songs that have been meaningful in her life, including “Close to Me” by the Cure, “Better Be Home Soon” by Crowded House and “Master Blaster” by Stevie Wonder. It’s set to be released in October and will be the third album for Driver, 44, whose musical influences include Americana and country music, like artists Neil Young, Bob Dylan and Bonnie Raitt.
For the concert, her band will include keyboardist Rami Jaffee, a founding member of the Wallflowers and current member of Foo Fighters; Joe Karnes, founding bassist of Fitz and the Tantrums; drummer Brendan Buckley, who plays with Shakira; and her longtime friend, guitarist Mark “Doc” Dauer, who has produced all of her albums.
“All these musicians respect her and her musical abilities,” Dauer said. “She’s incredibly engaging, she’s one of the smartest people I know, very artistic, very witty on her feet and so no two shows are alike.”
Driver first learned how to play the piano when she was about 5 years old. She later taught herself how to play guitar and sang in choir. She also acted in school plays and her mother, former model Gaynor Churchward, encouraged her to pursue acting.
Her acting career began in the 1990s with a role in the TV film “God on the Rocks” and appearances on several British TV series. During that time, Driver performed with the band that was working on a development deal with Island Records before she was cast in “Circle of Friends.”
That move led to roles in films like “Grosse Pointe Blank” in 1997, in which she starred with John Cusack, and “Good Will Hunting” in 1997, which earned her an Academy Award nomination.
Driver’s personal life also became fodder for tabloids thanks to her romantic relationships with actors Matt Damon and, later, Josh Brolin.
But through it all, there was always her music and in 2004 she released her first album, “Everything I’ve Got in My Pocket,” a collection of folk-pop songs. That was followed in 2007 with her second album, “Seastories.” It was recorded in Los Angeles and New York and included collaborations with Ryan Adams and Liz Phair.
“I’ve always done both (music and acting). It was a total toss-up as to which one would be my full career,” Driver said.
The upcoming album of cover songs was something Driver and her band had been planning for a while, and it was a good way to get back into recording since it’s been a few years between records, she said. But new original material is also on the way.
“I’ve got a whole other record ready to go, which I’ll put out in another couple of years,” she said. “But this was a great way to get back into recording.”
Meanwhile, Driver, who is now the mother of a young child and three stepchildren, continues with her acting career, often blending it with her musical talents.
She received an Emmy nomination last week for her starring role as a wife struggling with the loss of her unborn child in the Lifetime movie “Return to Zero,” for which she also wrote the title song. In addition, she plays a character she describes as a “bad mommy” in “Beyond the Lights,” a film about a rising young female musician, set for release in November.
“I’m fantastically busy but I love it,” she said. “You make time for the things you love and this all comes from my heart.”HOME MLB Colorado Rockies Gear Colorado Rockies Mens Colorado Rockies Mens Cups, Mugs & Shots Product ID: 836482

Helmets are just not mainstream to the majorty of the population.
Also, their risk managers have not realized the exposure. I own a construction company and my insurance carrier has never audited my use of safety equipment. I do use safety equipment and my accident modifier makes my insurance company happy.
It will just take a big lawsuit.
I'm not sure how the liability laws are for self injury though. For example if a delivery guy is driving a car but doesn't wear his seat belt. Is the company liable for his self injury.
However, if he's driving and causes an injury to someone else due to negligence I could see the company being sued as it was part of his work.
So, the long and short is, I have no clue.
JJ's is about two blocks from my office in downtown Sarasota, so I see their delivery guys bombing around every day.
Never seen any of them wearing helmets.
The thing that bothers me is how they blow through stop lights/signs, curb hop, blast down sidewalks, etc. Just waiting for one of the them to mow down some elderly retired couple on the sidewalk. Not doing a lot to enhance the image of cyclists in general.
Most of them ride fixie beaters, but one older mangy guy rides a Cervelo that looks to be a couple of years old, but very dirty. He made a delivery to our office one day and I started to ask him about his bike, thinking he might be a free-spirit roadie moonlighting as a sandwich delivery guy. It was apparent the guy didn't know squat about bikes, other than he had a "nice" one. Hate to say it, but I have suspicions about exactly how this guy "acquired" it.
Mark
Yeah, the Sarasota guys are idiots. I almost hit one a few weeks back because he "jaywalked" across an intersection against traffic.
We don't have the delivery cyclists in the burbs...but I become a very happy woman when we got one a few miles from here!
The sammiches are delicious!! (Whoever thinks otherwise is crazy!!) And they sell their day old bread for 50 cents a loaf...they make FANTASTIC meatball subs or other sub sandwiches... I have been asked why I enjoy JJ so much vs. a place like subway. I feel like their ingredients are much fresher.
Plus they are from Central IL - like me! (EIU was where the first one was...)
</semi-related hijack off>
Do they supply the bikes?
I like their Billy Club
Sorry, any sandwich place that doesn't have mustard as one of the standard toppings (you have to get it in packets after the fact, if they even have any packets) is not a place I want to go.
I've always found their sandwiches to be... meh...>>IMAGE…]

SAN FRANCISCO -- After Italy's Luna Rossa handily won its third race in the Louis Vuitton Cup semifinals Friday, skipper Max Sirena lashed out against Oracle Team USA, which is under investigation for hiding lead pellets in the boats it raced in the America's Cup World Series last year.
"I'm not happy for my sport, not happy for the people watching us and especially because they are always the guys that are playing these games really clean and nice, but in reality they are always the guys that try to cheat," Sirena said with a strong Italian accent after Friday's decisive win over Sweden's Artemis Racing. "I don't even look at them anymore. I lost my -- how do you say in English? -- my respect. I lost my respect for them completely."
The latest trouble to hit the America's Cup is an embarrassing humiliation at the least for Oracle Team USA. The team has already forfeited its World Series trophies, but whether the team will be penalized by the international jury investigating the matter, or whether the America's Cup next month will be affected, remains to be seen.
Russell Coutts, CEO of Oracle Team USA, acknowledged Friday that the infraction is "serious," even though it occurred in 45-foot catamarans during four races in the ACWS last year.
The infraction was a "mistake" committed by unnamed workers without the knowledge of the team's management or skippers, Coutts said. When the problem was brought to the team's attention, the team immediately forfeited its titles.
"We don't condone breaking the rules," Coutts said. "We had a policy in place. That policy wasn't followed."
Coutts said this incident is nothing if not "stupidity," because adding "lead shot" inside the front "king posts" didn't help the overall performance of the boat.
"It's pretty obvious it's not designers that were involved," he said. "If you had designer input, they would have told you not to do it. It's actually going to make the boat go slightly slower."
The extra weight was discovered by a boat builder preparing one of the AC45s for the Red Bull Youth America's Cup next month. After America's Cup measurement committee members inspected it, they concluded that "the modifications appear to be intentional efforts" to circumvent the class rules "and are therefore serious in nature." The three AC45s in question were sailed by Oracle, as well as Ben Ainslie Racing.
Ainslie, an Olympic gold medalist who borrowed an Oracle boat to sail for Britain in the ACWS last summer, and Emirates Team New Zealand issued comments Friday.
"As skipper of the boat I had no knowledge whatsoever that the boat was being raced out of measurement," Ainslie said in a statement. "I am deeply disappointed by this incident and will do all I can to assist the relevant parties in any further investigations."
Grant Dalton, managing director of the New Zealand team, said he was "stunned" by the revelations.
"I find it difficult to believe that what we learned last night actually happened at the top level of our sport," Dalton said.
The only team making light of the news was Iain Percy, skipper of Sweden's Artemis Racing. He said he was so busy preparing for Friday's race against Luna Rossa that he barely had a chance to focus on Oracle's troubles, except to "have a chuckle, feel sorry for my mates across the way then get on with the race today."
The revelations overshadowed Race 3 of the best-of-seven Louis Vuitton Cup semifinals between Luna Rossa and Artemis Racing. On Friday both teams sailed their best races, with each improving its tactics and speed. Luna Rossa had a perfect start, hydrofoiled well through its downwind turns and beat Artemis by 1 minute, 18 seconds.
The teams face each other at 1:15 p.m. Saturday. If the Italians win, the Swedes will be eliminated and Luna Rossa will advance to the Louis Vuitton finals against New Zealand.

Please share remembrances and condolences at.Match.com has agreed that they will start screening their members to ensure they are not sex offenders. While it is certainly a nice gesture, and one that will protect people, it is not going to make a tangible difference in how people date online. At the end of the day, people must be more careful when choosing who to date, whether they meet online or not.
This came about when Carole Markin was sexually assaulted after a date with Alan Paul Wurtzel, who she met on Match.com, and who is a convicted sex offender. Had Markin done a simple Google search of Wurtzel, she would have seen that he was a sex offender. It’s great that Match is going to run background checks, but we still need to be careful.
I don’t go out with anyone without knowing their last name, finding out where they work, and doing a Google search. It’s not a guarantee that I will be safe, nor does it give me a sense of false security, but it only takes a minute, and in the case of someone like Wurtzel, could protect me. Match is doing what all sites should do, but it’s not fool proof.
Do we ever know who are dating? People lie about their height and age, but people also lie about being a sex offender whether you meet them online, in a bar, at the grocery store, or in temple or church. Nobody is going to tell you they like long walks on the beach, red wine, and sexually assaulting women. Some lies transcend all types of dating. Important to note that just because someone is not in the sexual offenders database, does not mean they are not a sexual offender.
It is an industry changing decision for Match.com to take this step, and while eHarmony does it already, Match is the industry leader, and what they do, and don’t do, matters. This decision however, should not make anyone dating online feel any safer. Good for them for doing the right thing, but we need to meet them halfway and do our part.
Always meet people in a public place, and don’t invite them to your home. Find out their last name, and where they work. Do a Google search to see if any red flags come up. Search for them on Facebook and see if you know people in common. We live in a digital and connected time and to not use the resources available to us is stupid. Use the Internet to help you.
Dating is brutal. Meeting a complete stranger to hang out and have a drink is odd, and even if you spend hours on the phone, they are still a stranger. Know that. You have a responsibility to date responsibly. It’s all a crapshoot and in the end do we ever really know someone? I married a man and 5 years later divorced someone else. You really just never know.
The chances of meeting someone to share your life with are not great. I believe there is someone for everyone, and truly hope we get more than one shot at finding them, so if online dating helps my odds then I’m in. Although I doubt I will find my soulmate online, I will follow the example set by Match.com, and be careful, cautious, and proactive in my search. All we can really do is cross our fingers, try to be safe,Speed doesn’t always equal talent – and Urban Meyer covets both. Before the notion of “SEC speed” even existed, Meyer wanted to load up on quick players. Ohio State’s most recent recruiting class served as another example of Meyer’s insatiable thirst for speed.
The Buckeyes weren’t devoid of speed in the secondary last season. But the talent and philosophy didn’t mesh, rendering any advantage irrelevant. With Everett Withers’ departure and Chris Ash’s arrival, however, plans have changed. An aggressive style was instituted and with it a meshing of speed and talent.
Those characteristics will be spotlighted at the underrated position of nickelback, which is also the name of an overrated band. In an instant last season – perhaps the most important moment – nickelback Tyvis Powell etched his name into Ohio State lore with a then-season saving interception. Speed and talent were on full display.
Powell had 48 tackles in 2013, but it was his interception of Michigan quarterback Devin Gardner on what could have been a game-winning two-point conversion that will be remembered. In 2014, Powell will shift over to strong safety, giving way to Cam Burrows, Armani Reeves, Eli Apple and whoever else might make a dent in fall camp.
The nickelback position took a hit in spring practice when safety Vonn Bell was lost to a knee injury. It thrust Burrows into the safety role, having a domino effect on nickel, where everyone shot up a rung. Bell and Burrows will compete for a starting safety job in August, with Bell entering camp as the odds-on-favorite.
Nickelback has become a position of importance for the Buckeyes – and most teams across the country. Along with quarterback and wide receiver, no position on the football field has been uplifted more by the rise of spread offenses. Constant passing, four and five wide receivers means the defense must answer with an equal amount of defensive backs.
Ohio State has vowed to play more base defense this season, which diminishes the need for nickel formations. Safeties-turned-linebackers Darron Lee and Chris Worley could help Ohio State’s cause in passing situations. But the oversized bodies can limit who they can cover.
Meyer’s motto has long been about putting the best 11 players on the field, and that doesn’t change when it comes to nickelback. If a talented cornerback or safety makes the most sense at nickel, that’s who will be called upon. Kerry Coombs spent a month this spring deciphering who can and cannot play the position, finding that the Buckeyes have a horde of candidates.
“There’s some guys,” he said. “Eli can play the nickel. If Vonn is at safety, then Cam Burrows can play nickel. So we've got some pieces there, and we've got some really good freshmen coming in that are going to have a chance to do that.”
At the top of that list is Erick Smith and Damon Webb. Meyer has already spent time gushing over Smith, and the true freshman made it clear earlier this summer that his goal is to find the field quickly and make sure coaches don’t forget his name.
“Erick Smith, he’s a guy I'm really excited to get here,” Meyer said. “He played corner in the [U.S. Army All-American Bowl], but we plan on putting him at safety. And, once again, immediately [on the depth chart].”
At the inaugural Ohio-Michigan Border Classic, Smith didn’t hide his disappointment after Ohio lost the game. He admitted he’ll file it away in the back of his mind and pull it out twice in the month of November. It’s all part of his intensely competitive nature.
“I want to make the best of my opportunities,” Smith said. “I’m not going to back down because I'm a freshman. Proving people wrong is used as motivation. I’m fearless. I've been playing football too long to be scared. I'm ready to step out there. I just have to remain patient. I love competition.”
Both Smith and Webb are cut from the same cloth. They’re football players to the core, eager to deliver a big hit while never shying away from the rigors of the sport. Glenville head coach Ted Ginn Sr. and Cass Tech head coach Thomas Wilcher each elevated their respective players’ status to the top when listing all the greats they’ve coached.
Supplanting Burrows, Reeves or Apple will prove difficult. The trio’s experienced and knows what the position entails. All three have size and strength to keep the upper hand against bigger receivers.
It’s possible that Reeves’s spring performance could have given him an advantage over the competition. It would also add clarity to the cornerback position, clearing the way for Gareon Conley and Apple to play opposite Doran Grant.
You won’t find Meyer, Coombs, Chris Ash or Luke Fickell complaining about a surplus of viable options. Nickelback is a position of value in today’s college football, with Powell essentially being a starter last season.
It may take three weeks of camp to get the specifics sorted out, but when the official depth chart is posted, the fifth defensive back will have speed and talent.
The safety position seems solid, with Burrows to back up Bell and Powell, but the corners seem thin... I'm sure the freshman are good, but makes me nervous to see a true freshman inserted into a corner position.. After watching the spring game, for some reason I was left with the impression Apple could use another year before stepping into a starting role, especially the nickel..
Apple and Conley will both be RS Freshman this coming season.I have reservations about Smith stepping into starting NB spot too. I felt that Apple was the best DB on the field during the spring game. I was there and watched him allot and he seems to have a nose for the ball when it's in the air. Also I was looking at the new rostor Osu released and noticed that Christopher Worley was listed as a safety while Darren Lee was listed at LB. All spring they said both were Walkout Linebackers. Wonder why CW is listed @ SAF?
Yea my bad, I didn't mean to reference Apple as a true freshman, I was just assuming he would get time at nickel if reeves and grant are the starting CBs.. He did seem to have a knack for the ball, I think it's his size that I'm down on, he looked small to me, and the nickel back needs to be able make tackles on running plays out of spread offenses...
no idea on Worley...
i welcome the safety/nickel trio of Bell Burrows and Smith, Smith seems to have that ball hawking ability, i cant speak for Burrows speed but his size is monsterous and Bell seems to be on track for the next Big thing. He played great in that bowl game given the circumstances. also dont sleep on Webb and Latimore making a splash early on that depth chart.

I believe he's talking about the competition for the OTHER safety spot, opposite Powell, and who will end up as the 5th defensive back.

I know some of those safeties and DB's at Wisconsin under Ash could flat out lay the wood. Hoping some of that was scheme combined with skill.
Smith is going to be a great one.

I'm not sure that Reeves locking up nickle means that the other corner will be Apple/Conley. He was previously listed as the starter at both positions, with another corner coming in when he's at nickle.
I think using the word overrated is way too kind for those no-talent ass clowns from Canada FWIW.
It really is a shame that Vonn was hurt this spring as I believe he is the most athletic safety we have had here for a very long time ( as the Clemson interception will attest to). Hopefully he fully heals up and hits the ground running this fall because we need him back there to be one of our defensive playmakers. I know it is not a popular belief but I thank Armani wins the other CB job due to his physical nature being suited for our change in philosophy. Cam will start the season as the nickel, his skillset is perfect for the role due to his size,speed and coverage skills. It is really hard not to get to excited about our secondary cause, honestly, when was the last time we had this much talent and explosiveness in our backups? With our schedule this year there is no reason why we shouldn't be a top 20 D, unless we score to fast and often
It gets kind of rough in the back of my limousine,
I love Cam, and I hope he gets on the field due to his ability, but if he's the starting nickle, I doubt he'll be on the field much. Lee/Worley probably have that "spot" locked up.
My man, Tyvis Powell
Go Bucks!
I really like Webb at the nickel and Smith in the backend. I've got my hopes that they can play some substantial minuets this fall.
To be honest I dont like webb at the nickle at all, I dont think his game is suited for it, he will be the next great osu shut down corner on the outside but there is a reason the nickle guys always gets moved to saftey, o johnson, Hines, Bryant, Powell.....those are the kinda guys they like there, I see webb as more of a roby
^ best post ever ^
I like Webb in the rotation at the nickle and also to possibly back up Grant at the boundary corner.
At least our Nickleback wont suck......
Imo the band is not over rated.
The band is alot like the Foo Fighters. I don't believe either has ever put out a crappy song
" It's real good whatcha done Anthony, real good ! "
I'll never claim to be an authority on Rock and Roll, but putting Foo Fighters and Nickelback in the same sentence is like putting "teeth" and "penis" in the same sentence. You just don't do it man.
"because we couldn't go for three"
I just cringed at that notion. Ouch! Lmao
There is nothing more remarkable as learning to think better.
I will be shocked if its not bell at the saftey and burrows playing the nickel, which I think he will be great at, and maybe smith coming in for dime packages
^ best post ever ^
Talent and options...great to be a fan of the osu. Keep in mind they're all young and will make some mistakes, but unlike last year they should look better as the season progresses
'Piss excellence' -RB
A Year away from being one of the best units on the field.
I wish that this "nickel" and a spot on the DL were like Heacock's defenses. The Bucks had a DB that could hit like a LB while also having a faster player on the DL to cause disruption by rushing the QB and also sometimes dropping into coverage. Cam Heyward played it great when he got his chance to lead the DL. Those positions were called the "Star" and the "Leo". We seem to have a great Leo that fits the mold in Spence....I just miss the good old days when our Leo (or Viper that lines up as the 7) and our Star were feared players. It seems that the defense has been a bit weaker since the difference of the Star and Leo positions. Maybe there has been no "star" or "Leo" because of the lack of personnel to play the spots...that definitely IS NOT the case now. Plus, with the addition of Chris Ash, we may have lost the Star forever....unless the nickel is the Star and Spence with his speed, and long arms (he is a prototypical Leo) is the Leo. The defense is just different now and we all loved the Buckeye defenses under Heacock. Even Tressel said,"Jim Heacock is the reason why this team is playing for the national title. His defense carries the team".
Remember those days? They could return as I believe this could be one of the best defenses that Ohio State has had in a long time and the Buckeye offense is twice what the Buckeye offenses were in the days of Tressel, Heacock, and Fickell who learned Heacock's defenses for years before Heacock left. I'm Fick's biggest fan. I've never blamed him...but I'm going to start if the defense is not as good as they can be here in 2014.
"I hope they're last in everything"
Thanks, Urb!
Webb needs to STAY at corner, like said, that guy can be a lock down corner.
Maybe we should run a 3-3-5 defense with the depth we have, lol?
It's a really nice problem, we are so loaded on defense!!!
"The Past Builds the Future"
Why not go a 4-1-6? Use two nickels or extra safeties to replace a LB or two. If we have the talent and hitters in the secondary (and it sure sounds like we do), I say get them on the field all together against the spread.
What's round on the ends and high in the middle? Tell me if you know!
If we have a unit that didn't suck last year, it was the DL. Why would be get rid of one to add someone from another group who hasn't shown they are better? Same kind of goes for dropping a LB, although it's more of an even trade there.
Crimson, I was thinking that a few of our safeties almost have LB size, but are a step faster. If the best 11 happen to be 6 DBs, play them all at the same time, right?
What's round on the ends and high in the middle? Tell me if you know!
Yeah, I'm not sure 4-1-6 is a terrible idea (3-x-x worries me). One of Perry, Grant/McMillan, and Lee/Worley better deserve to be on the field. Powell, Bell, Burrows, and Apple/Conley/Reeves (plus true freshmen) aren't proven commodities either, although I like the potential of a lot of them. Lee/Worley is probably the first one off for a 4-2-5, and I'd love to see Burrows step in, but I'm not sure who's better right now.
I totally agree with your reply. I don't want to see us drop to 3 linemen and basically concede the pass rush to play pass defense. I am sure we would still see pressure from the 3 linemen, but put 4 on the field to minimize the double-teams, and limit the QB's time to throw.
What's round on the ends and high in the middle? Tell me if you know!Nov. 23, 2012

BLOOMINGTON, Ind. - The Indiana women's basketball team won its fourth-straight game with a 60-49 win over IUPUI in Assembly Hall on Friday night. IU held a third straight opponent under 50 points, the first time for a Hoosier team to perform that feat since 1973-74. Three Hoosiers scored in double-figures led by Aulani Sinclair's 20 points.
Linda Rubene started things offensively for Indiana (4-1) with back-to-back layups before she found an open Milika Taufa who connected on a 3-point field goal at the 17:39 mark to give IU a 7-0 lead.
After an IUPUI (3-2) field goal, Jasmine McGhee nailed a layup to get the lead back to seven points. Taufa followed with another field goal before Sinclair took advantage of a Jaguar turnover to hit a jumper to give Indiana a 13-2 edge with 15:59 to play in the opening stanza.
Indiana pushed its lead to 15 points, 27-12, but IUPUI answered with a 6-0 run to cut the deficit into single digits with 4:30 to play in the half.

The world becomes your lucky star
You wander around like a peacock
With your lover on your arm
Next time you fall
You think youve heard it all
No one could turn your insides out
And your friends hear you say
If your heart slips away
I'll wonder what it's all about
Chorus
Well it's first time love, giving you fever
Second time love, cooling your brow
Finally love takes your hand in the dark
And leads you home somehow
So never say never another
Just because somebody broke your heart
Get your chin off the floor
You'll never know what's in store
If you don't give love a chance to start
And if you don't believe in following feelings
It's never too late to start
Cause of you open your eyes
Then you'll realize
I'm the one whos chasing your heart
Chorus And its...
And it's first time love making your heartbeat
Second time love making it stop
Finally love picks you up from the bottom
And leads you home some how.

Ricardo Lamas Slams Nik Lentz: He Has No Heart
Top ranked UFC featherweight Ricardo Lamas fired back at Nik Lentz today during an interview with MMAJunkie.
Lentz took a shot at Lamas’ performance this past Saturday against Hacran Dias, saying he would beat Lamas easy. “The Bully” didn’t take too kindly to that, and fired back by saying:
“if he wants some, he can get some.”
Lamas continued with:
“First of all, this kid doesn’t even have heart,” he said. “I’ve heard stories about this guy; my boy Luis Palomino, ‘Baboon,’ was down at (American Top Team) for a while, sparred with Nik one time, messed him up, and then Nik wanted to duck him for the rest of the sparring sessions he was there. They would not let ‘Baboon’ spar with him. To me, that shows no heart.
“When I go up against somebody and they give me a licking in a sparring session, you bet your ass I’m coming after you the next time. There’s no way you’re not going to let me spar you again, because I’m going to come after you until I get you. That just shows if you have heart or not, and this kid has no heart.
“He goes on Twitter saying, ‘I (would) beat Ricardo Lamas or Cub Swanson easy. Easy money.’ I know he’s popping his mouth off to get a better fight, but there’s no need for that.”
Neither fighter currently has a fight scheduled, but with Lamas’ broken thumb, it may be a while before we get to see this one resolved in the cage.(Note: This story was updated at 7:30 p.m. Feb. 28, 2014, to replace an incomplete version of the story.)
Nearly 700 students received free dental services during a two-day pediatric dental clinic through N.C. Missions of Mercy, the state’s largest free mobile dental program.
The Project L.I.F.T learning community partnered with the N.C. Dental Health Fund and other public and private organizations to offer free teeth cleanings, screenings, sealants and other preventive services to uninsured and under-insured students from nine Charlotte-Mecklenburg schools.
More than 30 stations were set up in the gym at Friendship Missionary Baptist Church on Thursday and Friday, and volunteer dental professionals from across the state spent roughly 30 minutes with each student.
Community and educational volunteers – such as students in Central Piedmont Community College’s dental program – also helped educate kids about proper dental hygiene.
Even though many had never been to a dentist, there wasn’t much apprehension from the students, said Scott Davenport, president of the N.C. Dental Society.
Jordan Logan, 11, is a sixth-grader at Ranson IB Middle School. Friday afternoon wasn’t the first time he’d seen a dentist, so he wasn’t nervous, he said. But he did learn something new, such as the best toothbrush position to get plaque off his back teeth.
The free clinic took more than a year of planning to put together, and area dentists Spurgeon Webber and Brandi Jackson – who co-chaired the initiative – called it historic.
It was the first Missions of Mercy pediatric clinic in the state, Jackson said, and the first privately funded pediatric dental clinic in the nation to bring together public and private entities.
A grant from Sisters of Mercy and private funding helped ensure the event was successful, Webber said. Next steps include helping parents find resources for ongoing care, such as the Mecklenburg County Health Department and others, organizers said.
“Improved education through improved health is good for our community,” Webber said. “It’s a template that can be duplicated and improved upon regionally and nationally.”About these stories

DURHAM —
Collin Wilkes, member of Boy Scout Troop 451 in Durham, is at the National Boy Scouts of America Jamboree this week at the Summit Bechtel Reserve in West Virginia. He is serving as hometown news correspondent for Jamboree Troop A120, made up of scouts from Durham. This is another of the periodic reports he will file for readers of The Herald-Sun.The Indians were still giving trouble along the Texas frontier. A line of government posts, extending from Red River on the north to the Rio Grande on the south, made a pretense of holding the Comanches and their allies in check, while this arm of the service was ably seconded by the Texas Rangers. Yet in spite of all precaution, the redskins raided the settlements at their pleasure, stealing horses and adding rapine and murder to their category of crimes. Hence for a number of years after my marriage we lived at the Edwards ranch as a matter of precaution against Indian raids. I was absent from home so much that this arrangement suited me, and as the new ranch was distant but a day’s ride, any inconvenience was more than recompensed in security. It was my intention to follow the trail and trading, at the same time running a ranch where anything unfit for market might be sent to mature or increase. As long as I could add to my working capital, I was content, while the remnants of my speculations found a refuge on the Clear Fork.
During the winter of 1871-72 very little of importance transpired. Several social letters passed between Major Mabry and myself, in one of which he casually mentioned the fact that land scrip had declined until it was offered on the streets of the capital as low as twenty dollars a section. He knew I had been dabbling in land certificates, and in a friendly spirit wanted to post me on their decline, and had incidentally mentioned the fact for my information. Some inkling of horse sense told me that I ought to secure more land, and after thinking the matter over, I wrote to a merchant in Austin, and had him buy me one hundred sections. He was very anxious to purchase a second hundred at the same figure, but it would make too serious an inroad into my trading capital, and I declined his friendly assistance. My wife was the only person whom I took into confidence in buying the scrip, and I even had her secrete it in the bottom of a trunk, with strict admonitions never to mention it unless it became of value. It was not taxable, the public domain was bountiful, and I was young enough man those days to bide my time.
The winter proved a severe one in Kansas. Nearly every drover who wintered his cattle in the north met with almost complete loss. The previous summer had been too wet for cattle to do well, and they had gone into winter thin in flesh. Instead of curing like hay, the buffalo grass had rotted from excessive rains, losing its nutritive qualities, and this resulted in serious loss among all range cattle. The result was financial ruin to many drovers, and even augured a lighter drive north the coming spring. Early in the winter I bought two brands of cattle in Erath County, paying half cash and getting six months’ time on the remainder. Both brands occupied the same range, and when we gathered them in the early spring, they counted out a few over six thousand animals. These two contingents were extra good cattle, costing me five dollars a head, counting yearlings up, and from them I selected two thousand steer cattle for the trail. The mixed stuff was again sent to my Clear Fork ranch, and the steers went into a neighborhood herd intended for the Kansas market. But when the latter was all ready to start, such discouraging reports came down from the north that my friends weakened, and I bought their cattle outright.Paint Color Expert Sue Kim Goes Live

Joan Baez (center) was joined by the Indigo Girls for a closing set on Sunday.
LENOX — Joan Baez mentioned early on that she had recently visited the original site of Woodstock, the music festival she played while pregnant in August 1969.
“What a trip, man,” she said of going back there, adopting a far-out hippie accent that has never been part of her persona.
The past has always been alive for Baez, which is maybe why her set at Tanglewood on a muggy but sun-drenched day here was tinged with so much nostalgia on Sunday. She was already in familiar territory, too, sharing the bill with the Indigo Girls, who played Tanglewood with Baez in 1990.
Baez, who turned 72 this year, didn’t look back wistfully so much as she reassessed those halcyon days and gave thoughtful, often powerful renderings of some of her signature songs along with lesser-known material.
The potency of her earliest recordings — coiled tightly around Baez’s quaking soprano at the time — has given way to a more supple sound in recent years. Revisiting “Joe Hill” and “It’s All Over Now, Baby Blue,” she was at ease, her voice warm and unhurried, her phrasing the most nuanced it has ever been.
She’s traveling with a backing band that allows her to unfurl. Together with multi-instrumentalist Dirk Powell and her son, Gabe Harris, on percussion, they framed the songs in a loose Americana aesthetic that was nimble enough to accommodate folk standards (“Lily of the West”), country classics (“Long Black Veil”), and pop songs (“Imagine”).
It was astonishing to hear how Baez has grown into “The House of the Rising Sun,” turning it into a crawling acoustic blues lament, complete with a minor chord that Baez picked on her guitar to dissonant effect. “Swing Low, Sweet Chariot” — sung in honor of Baez’s mother, who died, at age 100, a few months ago — was similarly revelatory, a nearly a cappella rendition with Baez’s voice burrowing into her mid register and swooping to still-impressive heights.
More than 25 years into their career, the Indigo Girls are still emblematic of just how far hard work and solid musicianship can take you. Watching them on stage — and singing along at full volume to songs that hold up as classics (“Closer to Fine”) — you couldn’t help but sense they’ve become two trees that share the same roots. Amy Ray is the sturdy oak to Emily Saliers’s graceful willow.
Along with their band, they joined Baez for a closing set, rousing the crowd with “Don’t Think Twice, It’s All Right,” “The Water Is Wide,” and “Blowin’ in the Wind,” among others. They were songs that, like the afternoon’s performers, have stood the test of timeStelton now selling world's smallest electric espresso machine

Sorry to be the bearer of bad news but I checked with the owner of EL NORTE
which is now ARTISAN Entertainment. Their plan is to reissue to film in
theaters briefly in the late fall and than release on video and DVD which
will not be until end of 99 or beginning of 2000. They have never heard of
the other company
but I suspect their may have been some confusion when ARTISAN announced
last month it was reissuing the film. Perhaps someone thought the video was
comming soon.

After 45 years, Juanita Hayes-Hill has decided to sell Little Pals Day Care Center. Hayes-Hill, 75, opened the center with Nellie Beasley, now deceased, in 1968 with the idea of providing child care that also taught the basics for children on their way to kindergarten.
“We started on a song and a prayer,” and a little help from an SBA loan, Hayes-Hill said.
Since then, thousands of children – and later the children of those children – have attended Little Pals.
What started as a two-bedroom house converted into a day care center grew into the current building licensed for up to 80 children at 2739 N. Hillside.
Hayes-Hill hopes to sell Little Pals as is and has had some people express interest in it. But she’s not selling it as an easy venture.
“It’s a lot of work,” she said. “Day care is not a glamorous profession. ... The paperwork is tremendous. Meeting the licensing requirements, the yearly in-service requirements.
“There is a business aspect to it. A lot of people will come up to me and say they want to open up a day care center because they love children. That’s good, but you also have to have a business sense. And you have to be qualified.”
Over the years, the center has competed with larger, national day care chains.
“I think what has kept us in business all these years is the fact that we care,” she said. “That’s our model. ... Our kids know that every adult here is here to meet their needs. Our kids are right at home and comfortable and that’s what we
Hayes-Hill said she’ll miss the interaction with the children. She said she has enjoyed holding “graduations” each year for the children who are moving on to kindergarten, complete with their caps and gowns. Other yearly traditions included pony rides and hatching chicks and baby ducks.
In her retirement, she plans to volunteer more with Harry Hynes Hospice, rock babies at other day care centers and work on a book of all the cute things kids have said over the years. She’s actively involved in the Early Childhood Directors Organization of Wichita, National Association for the Education of Young Children and the St. Paul African Methodist Episcopal Church of Wichita.
Both of Alishea English’s children – daughter London, 5, and son Brooklyn, 10 – have attended Little Pals.
“It was just a very loving and nurturing environment,” English said. “It was always easy to leave them here because they were taken care of and they were being educated. They do a lot of fundamental enrichment work ... and get the education they need to be successful in kindergarten and beyond.”product details-Tab

Comments about Garnier Nutrisse Ultra Color Ultra Intense Red for Darker Hair Permanent Color, Light Intense Auburn R3, 1 ea:
I was skeptical about this color mainly because of the super low cost, but it has worked very well for me. The mildly pungent odor during processing was a small price to pay for the gorgeous results. I have never received so many compliments on my color, and it looked great even applied over highlights. My hair is naturally dark blonde, fine and thick with no gray.
Bottom Line Yes, I would recommend this to a friend

Only one minor problem...

See all my reviews
My husband brought me this when I asked for red hair dye. It is really, REALLY red. Plus, extra bonus, it doesn't fade as much as most other brands.One major drawback, it bleeds for a long time! Usually, for about two weeks after coloring the water in the tub tints orange. So, you have to be careful to protect your clothes while it is drying.

Color is gorgeous! I had been recently been dying my hair browns but I decided to go back to red and I'm so happy that I did! The color came out a cherry red and it compliments my beige skintone real well.

Perfect Red
By RedHairedRockHead
from Undisclosed
I use this product very infrequently; my usual coloring routine is henna, which takes planning and time, since I leave it on overnight. I have used this Garnier red when my roots begin to show and I just don't have time to make a batch of henna, have it sit on my head for 12 hours, and rinse it completely. The Garnier is a very close match for my deep burgundy/wine henna color and I always keep a box in the house for "hairmergencies". That being said, it has the same problems commercial dyes all have, which is what drove me to using henna in the first place - it smells bad, it damages the cuticle of my hair, and it contains chemicals that may threaten my long term health.

I get TONS of compliments on this color!
By Crimsoncrushedrose
from Turlock,CA
I always get so many compliments on this hair color! When I tell people it's a dye, they immediately ask me what brand and shade it is! My hair is naturally a more brown toned auburn, this turns it into an eye-popping red hue that goes perfectly with my pale, easily flushed complexion and green eyes! I hope it NEVER gets discontinued!

This is the first hair color I have used that gives you the exact color it says on the box. If you want to go red like she is on the box I recommend this highly.

Pilates exercises may be a beneficial adjunctive treatment for patients with heart failure, offering functional capacity improvements, according to a study published in the December issue of Cardiovascular Therapeutics.
(HealthDay)—Pilates exercises may be a beneficial adjunctive treatment for patients with heart failure, offering functional capacity improvements, according to a study published in the December issue of Cardiovascular Therapeutics.
To examine the efficacy of Pilates in patients with heart failure, Guilherme Veiga Guimarães, M.D., of the Universidade de São Paulo in Brazil, and colleagues conducted a study involving 16 patients with New York Heart Association class I or II heart failure who were randomly assigned to 30 minutes of aerobic exercise followed by 20 minutes of either mat Pilates training or a conventional cardiac rehabilitation program for 16 weeks.
At 16 weeks, the researchers found that patients in both groups showed a significant increase in exercise time, with a larger increase for the Pilates group (11.9 ± 2.5 to 17.8 ± 4 minutes and 11.7 ± 3.9 to 14.2 ± 4 minutes, respectively). Only the Pilates training exhibited significant increases from baseline in ventilation, peak oxygen consumption (VO2), and O2 pulse. Compared with the conventional group, peak VO2 was significantly improved in the Pilates group.
"The results of this study demonstrate the feasibility of a combined aerobic training and mat Pilates method by its safe and functional capacity improvements in patients with heart failure," the authors write.

The University of Wyoming men’s golf team has been named an All-Academic Team by the Golf Coaches Association of America (GCAA) for the fourth-consecutive season. The Cowboys were one of 81 Division I programs and 141 men’s golf programs overall to earn the honor presented by Farmers Insurance.
“I’m proud of our kids’ efforts in the classroom and for all the travel we do it is very impressive to earn this award,” head coach Joe Jensen said. “We have a culture of getting work done in the classroom and it is a great feeling to earn this award.”
To be eligible for GCAA All-Academic Team honors, a program must post a combined grade-point average above 3.0 during the academic year. Wyoming was one of three Mountain West school to earn the award. Five Cowboys earned Academic All-MW honors with two student-athletes earning MW Scholar Athlete.
"I'm very appreciative of our faculty and administration, especially the Academic Support office," Jensen said. "Our student-athletes receive tremendous support and guidance from them.”Stepan Posts a Successful Season With Waterloo
The legendary Shattuck-St. Mary’s Preparatory School in Faribault, Minnesota is known for producing some of the greatest hockey talents the NHL has seen in recent years. Names like Sidney Crosby, Zach Parise, Jonathan Toews and Derek Stepan have all donned the Shattuck-St. Mary’s Sabres sweater. But it was another Shattuck player and another Stepan that drew the Nashville Predators attention.
“When Zach Stepan was available in the draft we knew we had a very intelligent, two-way player that we couldn’t pass up,” Predators Assistant General Manager Paul Fenton said. “He thinks through the game and sees the ice better than a lot of players that were available at that point.”
The Predators selected Stepan, a 5-11, 171-pound forward ranked 53rd among North American skaters in Central Scouting's final rankings, in the fourth round of the 2012 NHL Entry Draft.
Prior to the draft, the Hastings, Minn., native had just finished his senior season at Shattuck-St. Mary’s in the Upper Midwest High School Elite League. Stepan took the ice in 50 games, posting 65 points (22g-43a) during the regular season as the Sabres finished 50-5-2. That success carried over into the Elite League, where he added 20 points (7g-13a) in 15 games as Shattuck went on to win the U18 Tier 1 National Championship for the second consecutive season after defeating the L.A. Junior Kings in the championship game.
Following his senior season, Stepan, who is committed to Ohio State University, decided to forgo his first year of college, and instead joined the United States Hockey League’s Waterloo Black Hawks for the 2012-13 season. He finished his first USHL season with 78 points (32g-46a) in 56 games, and was named the USHL CCM Player of the Week on four separate occasions, most recently on April 8. Prior to last week’s award, he held the honor on Jan. 7 and shared the title on two other occasions (Nov. 26 and Oct. 29).
“The thing about playing in Waterloo and at this level is the opponents are a lot bigger and a lot more skilled,” Stepan said. “So the key to my development with Waterloo has been learning to play at a consistent level against this level of players. Down at Shattuck, there were some teams that weren’t as big or as skilled, so you didn’t have to work as hard on some nights. Here you have to work hard and be consistent every time you play because all the teams are the same skill level.”
Thanks in part to an eight-game winning streak at the end of the regular season and Stepan’s play, the Black Hawks are currently facing the Fargo Force in the opening round of the USHL playoffs. Stepan recorded 12 points (6g-6a) during that eight game stretch.
“There were some really good players at Shattuck and the practice speed was nearly at this level, but not everything was that high-paced,” Stepan said. “As this season has gone on, the game has slowed down and it’s been easier from the mental side.”
While Predators fans are eager to see a player of Stepan’s skill level make it to Nashville, concerns over his size still linger among professional scouts and pundits. Waterloo’s head coach P.K. O’Handley – an 11-year coaching veteran who recently won his 500th game – disagrees with those concerns and assessments.
“There have been some questions about his size, but size doesn’t matter in his case,” O’Handley said. “He plays bigger than he is. He is still young and he is going to continue to grow and mature. I don’t think his size will be a factor in his career.
“Zach is a very intelligent player on both sides of the puck. He has great vision and his defensive game is really coming around. He has a certain tenacity about his game and he just won’t be denied. He also shoots the puck like a pro.”
While physical and mental maturity has helped with his recent success, Stepan believes it wouldn’t be possible without the coaching prowess of O’Handley.
“There are a couple of reasons why P.K. is a successful coach,” Stepan said. “First, he’s been around the game for a long time and he’s just an intelligent, seasoned coach, who knows the game very well. Also, he genuinely cares about all his players. When you have a coach who cares so much about preparing players for the next level, I think that really helps guys focus on giving him their best. I think those two things are why he’s been able to win so many hockey games and have so many players move on to the next level.”
Another Predator was also able to mature and develop within P.K. O’Handley’s system and he went on to post one of the best rookie seasons in franchise history. That player is second-year forward, Craig Smith.
O’Handley, who Smith lists as the most influential person in his career, said he’s humbled by the recognition, but it’s more about the players growing up as good men than growing up as good hockey players.
“I’m a demanding coach who doesn’t let his players cut corners,” O’Handley said. “They have to embrace the work ethic and be willing to give everything they have. These guys have to be able to play through any adversity in order to be successful at the next level. Successful players that I have coached, like Craig and Joe [Pavelski], were able to embrace everything – the work ethic, the adversity – and they went on to be pretty successful at the next level.
“I try to help them grow not only as hockey players, but as men – to develop them as a whole. I care about what they do on and off the ice. I want them to be just as good off the ice as they are on it. I’m very humbled that they see me as a role model, or as an influential guy, but I just want to see my players do well in everything.”
Stepan hopes to follow Smith’s career path as he decides on the next step of his career. In Smith’s case, his next stop after Waterloo was the University of Wisconsin, but for Stepan that next step is still taking shape.
“It’s an inspirational thing for me, knowing that such a good player developed in Waterloo and did so well in this system and had that much success in Nashville,” Stepan said of Smith. “His success shows just how good the Waterloo system is and I’m excited to use what I’ve learned while playing for P.K. as I move on to the next level.”
Other than O’Handley, Stepan has another eye watching him as he develops as a player – his cousin and third-year forward for the New York Rangers, Derek Stepan.
“He told me to just have fun with it,” Stepan said of his cousin. “He and I are kind of on the same page of – If you get too serious, it can almost throw you off your game. You have to always play your game and play it the way you know you can be successful.”
Even at a young age, Stepan seems to already have a grasp on the work ethic we’ve come to expect from the Nashville Predators.
“If you work hard and play your game, the success will come with it.”Dr. Diana K. Lemley, MD

Wisconsin lawmakers praise Obama decision on Syria

The weakness in the world's most widely used browser was identified by security company McAfee Inc, and later confirmed by Microsoft.
Google said on Tuesday that in mid-December, it detected an attack on its corporate infrastructure originating from China that resulted in the theft of its intellectual property. It eventually found that more than 20 other companies had been infiltrated.
McAfee said on Thursday that those who engineered the attacks tricked employees of the companies into clicking on a link to a website that secretly downloaded sophisticated malicious software onto their PCs through a campaign that the hackers apparently dubbed Operation Aurora.
We have never seen attacks of this sophistication in the commercial space. We have previously only seen them in the government space, said Dmitri Alperovitch, a vice president of research with McAfee.
Microsoft later confirmed the flaw, and sent out an advisory to users to help mitigate the problem. It is still working on a patch that would solve it.
The company has determined that Internet Explorer was one of the vectors used in targeted and sophisticated attacks against Google and other corporate networks, Microsoft said.
The world's largest software company said using Internet Explorer in protected mode with security settings at high would limit the impact of the vulnerability..
McAfee's Alperovitch declined to say which companies had hired McAfee, saying they had signed confidentiality agreements.
So far the only other victim to come forward is design software maker Adobe Systems Inc, which has said that it is still investigating the matter.
Some researchers have speculated that the attackers may have exploited flaws in Adobe's Acrobat software and its widely used Reader program for opening PDF documents.
McAfee's researchers said that they found no evidence that was the case.
Still, they said that the hackers may have used other types of malicious software to break into Google and the other companies.
Internet Explorer is vulnerable on all recent versions of the Windows operating system, including Windows 7, according to McAfee. Microsoft said attacks had been limited to IE6, an older version of the application.

You may even think that you’ll never be able to get the problem under control, however, all is not lost, and in this article we aim to give you some information on not just one acne home treatment, but a few.
The reason for this is it will probably take you a while to find the right acne home treatment for you, and that’s why patience, and perseverance is something you will need. There are no miracle cures for acne, and if you’re serious about getting it under control, you need to know your spots won’t clear-up overnight.
Acne Home Treatment – The Basics
Many people think acne is caused by poor hygiene, and this simply isn’t true. In fact, you may be frustrated that you’ve stepped up your hygiene routine, only to find that your acne is worse. The reason for this is “over-cleansing”.
The more you rub at your skin, and the more different products you use when getting rid of acne fast, the more irritable your skin will become, and in turn, you’ll suffer more spots. Listed below are some of the most common regimes you should follow as an acne home treatment:
- Only wash your skin morning, and night, and make sure you don’t use abrasive items such as sponges, or face-cloths, and DEFINITELY do not rub at your skin.
- When you wash, use a cleanser that has been formulated for sensitive skin, and has active ingredients that will aid as an acne solution.
- If you have long hair, keep it off your face, and the reason for this is your hair contains oils that can block your pores. You should also consider washing your hair every-day when getting rid of acne fast to help keep these oils at bay.
- Take a multi-vitamin each day, and before you decide on which one, speak to a professional about what vitamins will best help as an acne home treatment.
- Chromium is usually associated with weight-loss, but it’s also very useful while getting rid of acne fast because it’s excellent at healing wounds on the skin, so this should be another supplement you should consider taking.
- If you can, avoid wearing make-up, this will only block your pores, and cause more pimples. If you can’t do without it, keep the time you wear make-up to a minimum, and only use water based products, or products that are formulated for sensitive skin.
- Above all, DON’T pick, or pop your pimples, this will not make them go away, and contrary to popular belief, this is not a good method when treating acne marks or scars.
- Zenmed Acne Treatment, this Derma Cleanse formulation is created for long-term clear skin. Zenmed have based all of our formulations on the exfoliating qualities of alpha and beta hydroxy acids that will prevent dead skin build-up from happening in the first place, hence preventing pimple formation. This inspired approach treats all steps of the Acne cycle. Click Here to visit Zenmed official site to see the product I’m talking about.
Getting Rid of Acne Fast – What you should know
Whilst following the above guidelines will help when getting rid of acne, there are a couple of other things you can do. If you’re currently taking medically prescribed medicine for your acne, you may start to notice you’re sensitive to the sun. If this is the case, check with your doctor. This is also true of some acne products you can buy over the counter at your local pharmacy, so check on these as well.
If you’re told you stay out of the sun, make sure you follow this advice, and if you can’t avoid it, use a sun-block for sensitive skin that won’t block your pores.
You should also make sure you steer clear of any greasy products that can irritate your skin. In fact the more natural the products you use, the better.
Acne Home Treatment – Natural Methods
As a cleanser, you may be surprised that you can use fresh grapes. All you need to do is take 3 or 4 grapes from the fridge, cut them open, and rub the flesh over your skin. This will help to cleanse, and cool your skin, but make sure you follow with a cool water rinse afterwards. Below are a few more tips on acne home treatment:
- Cucumber is a great acne home treatment if you’re suffering from dry skin, and pimples that are starting to heal, but feel rough. There are a couple of ways you can use cucumber. Firstly, blend 1 cup of oatmeal, with 1 small cucumber. Mix this with one teaspoon of yogurt, and apply as a mask. Leave it for 30 minutes, and then wash off. Another way you can use cucumber when getting rid of acne fast is to mash a whole cucumber, and then strain the liquid from it. Mix this with 1 tablespoon of sugar, and apply to your skin. This acne remedy should only be left on for 10 minutes and then gently rinsed off.
- If you don’t have the time to prepare a face mask, you can use natural honey. The only thing you need to make sure you do is rinse with warm water before applying the honey, because this will help open your pores. Leave the honey for 30 minutes, rinse off, and finish with some cold water to close your pores again.
- Yet another acne home treatment is yogurt and yeast, and this is perfect if you have oily skin. Brewer’s yeast is best for this acne home treatment, and you will need 1 teaspoon mixed with some plain yogurt. Apply the mixture to all the oil prone parts of your skin, as well as your pimples. This should be left on for about 15 to 20 minutes. Again, rinse off with warm water, and finish off with a splash of cold to close your pores.
These are just a few select acne home remedies you can choose from, and the best thing about them is they won’t cost you an inordinate amount of money, and most of the ingredients can be found around your home.
The other added benefit is you won’t have to worry about harmful side effects because all the ingredients are completely natural. However, it is always worth doing a skin test first, and if you’re allergic to any of the foodstuffs mentioned, consult your doctor before trying them.

Better warm up the TiVo, Team Jacob; Us Magazine reports that New Moon hunk Taylor Lautner will be testing out his comedic chops on December 12, as the host of Saturday Night Live. (Apparently, SNL‘s attempts to woo Lautner’s co-star, Robert Pattinson, have so far fallen flat.)
The questions abound: Do you think Lautner has the sense of humor to pull off the gig? Do you think T-Laut will spoof his classic The Adventures of Sharkboy and Lavagirl 3-D? Perhaps most importantly, how many skits do you think will require Taylor to doff his shirt? Share your predictions in the comments section!Endnotes for Chapter II

Return of the Jedi'sAt the time, the folk song in Malta was non existent! With simple, folk-style catchy tunes written by Joe to the lyrics of leading poets, and later, to his own lyrics as well, The Greenfields embarked on this new venture. It was not too long before influential radio and television people became aware of this new group, with its new folk-style songs on the local music scene. In fact, backed by a big number of radio and television shows, The Greenfields soon managed to make the Maltese public aware of this brand new 'local' type of music - the Maltese Folk Song! In a couple of years, songs like 'Il-Karozzin', 'Il-Vapur ta' l-art', 'Il-Banda t'Indri', 'Lejliet l-Imnarja', 'Tgħidx le Katrina', 'L-Għajn', and many other songs became instant household tunes. Obviously, other singers and groups followed, and the Maltese folk song scene flourished.
Unfortunately, Charles passed away in February 1990, and the Greenfields lost his guitar playing, and the third harmony voice in their singing. However, Joe and Carmen decided to keep going on as a duo.
To mark these two anniversaries for The Greenfields, and for Maltese music alike, WE productions broadcast The Greenfields' Biography, on the National Television channel TVM, on Tuesday, 9 March 2010.
Since then, The Greenfields have stopped activity in Hotels and Nightclubs. However, they do still perform on the local scene, taking part in social activities of towns and villages, Festas, Maltese Folk nights, Radio and TV.
While we thank Smash Radio for the continual support shown towards the programme, we must also say a BIG Thank You, to the vast amount of listeners who made it a point to tune in to 104.6, every Saturday morning, to listen to the Programme, and even more so, to those who participated regularly on it.
On the labels of Coca Cola bottles one would find printed a short phrase from the most popular songs of each of the singers chosen. Using the mobile, one can scan the printed bar code on the label to view a 10 seconds clip of the song printed on the bottle. Then, one may send the message and clip to friends on their mobile.
The singers chosen by Coca Cola for this endeavor represent a spread of over 50 years, and a wide spectrum of different kinds of music produced in Malta. From Folk to Rock, to Pop, to DJing!
Three popular songs from The Greenfields were chosen, namely "Ċeklem, Ċeklem, Karozzin", "Il-Vapur tal-art" and "Il-Banda ta' Indri'"
The campaign was officially launched during a reception at Cafe del Mar, Qawra, on Thursday 24 July 2014.
So if YOU find a Coca Cola bottle with one of the Greenfields' songs, drink the contents, of course, but also use your mobile to view, llisten and share the songs with your friends! It's fun!!By Jim GaramoneAmerican Forces Press Service
WASHINGTON, July 7, 2005 A recent attack on a medical assistance team in Afghanistan highlights the enemy's desperation, officials in the country said.
A joint Afghan-U.S. medical assistance team came under attack from a small group of enemy forces in the eastern province of Kunar. Soldiers drove the enemy away and continue to search the region.
"It's incredible to us that the enemy would attack our forces while we are providing innocent Afghans with health care," said Army Lt. Col. Jerry O'Hara, a spokesman for Combined Joint Task Force 76. "These attacks will not deter us; we will continue to provide this type of civic assistance to the people of Afghanistan.
"The enemy has proved through their actions again that they are only interested in oppression and terror for the people of this nation," he continued. "Every step we take forward with the Afghanistan government further and further marginalizes their cause."
The number of attacks directed against Afghan and coalition forces has increased, said Pentagon officials, who noted that there are a couple of reasons. First, summer is the "season" for war in the region. Winter in Central Asia is tough, and throughout history, it was a time when opposing sides hunkered down and waited for the weather to improve.
Second, the democratically elected Afghan government is making real progress. About 8.5 million Afghans voted in the October 2004 contest that elected Hamid Karzai as president. On Sept. 18, Afghanistan will hold elections for a national assembly and provincial councils. Officials hope the elections will show Taliban and al Qaeda remnants that the Afghan people do not sympathize with their brand of extremism.
In addition to the elections, other signs of progress in Afghanistan make terrorist positions untenable. Afghan and coalition officials are building roads, digging wells, building schools, establishing health clinics, providing veterinary services, and providing security. The NATO International Security Assistance Force has assumed security in the area around the capital of Kabul and the eastern part of the country, to include the city of Herat. About 8,000 NATO soldiers are helping the Afghan National Army and police forces maintain order and stability in the area.
The steps have splintered the Taliban. Officials said Taliban sympathizers are increasingly turning to the government. Karzai has reached out to those people to bring them into the political process. Officials believe this is a sign that the "moderates" in Afghanistan are winning.
Now is not the time to declare victory and pull out of the country, officials said. The opposition knows its only hope of beating the Afghan government and the coalition is to continue these small-scale attacks and hope that the international community loses patience.
Pentagon officials believe that, as the September elections approach, Taliban and al Qaeda operatives will step up their attacks in hopes of intimidating voters.
There is a hard-core group in the Taliban that will continue to fight, and the United States has about 19,000 troops in country to continue offensive operations.
Increasingly effective Afghan forces are joining those forces. There are about 24,000 members of the Afghan National Army and coalition forces have accelerated training to reach 70,000 by September 2007. In addition, there are about 40,000 Afghan police aiming toward 62,000 by October 2006.Your filtersClear All

Predicting Flash Floods The Front Range, part of the Rocky Mountains in Colorado, is prone to flash flooding because of steep surfaces and the heavy summer rains it experiences. Recently the National Center for Atmospheric Research (NCAR) has been testing a new forecasting system that aims to give specific flash flood warnings at least 30 minutes and possibly even 1 to 2 hours before the event. It is difficult to predict when flash floods will occur because they are so sudden. Although radar can detect heavy rain, it is hard to say whether a storm will stall over a particular area or what specific water source a flood is going to hit. These events depend on a number of factors, including soil and topographic and hydrologic features of the area. The new system provides a synthesis of information on both land and atmosphere, taking both surface conditions and hydrology into account. NCAR scientist David Yates said that the system is “unique in that it provides a detailed forecast of the location and duration of a severe storm, as well as the watershed’s likely response to the heavy rain. Since flash floods are complex and fast-moving events, we need to know about both weather and ground conditions in order to predict them.” Funded by the National Science Foundation and NOAA, the system uses radar detection from the National Weather Service and short-term computerized forecasts generated by NCAR’s Weather Research and Forecasting model, which simulates local atmospheric conditions in great detail. The new system will enable scientists to forecast the occurrence of flash floods for both particular streams as well as larger areas and to issue advance warning to those who will be affected. Thunderstorms Linked to Asthma A recent study by researchers from the University of Georgia and Emory University found that the number of hospital visits for asthma-related problems in the Atlanta area increased after thunderstorms. While numerous studies have documented the link between asthma and thunderstorms, this is the first conducted in the Southeastern United States, where thunderstorms and asthma are common. The study, published in the online edition of the medical journal Thorax, examined hospital data from 20 counties in the Atlanta region from 1993 to 2004. It also used data on thunderstorms, total daily rainfall, and maximum five-second wind gusts from Atlanta’s Hartsfield-Jackson International Airport. From more than 10 million emergency room visit records, the team found a 3 percent increase in visits for asthma on days after a thunderstorm. Researchers speculate that asthma hospitalizations increase following thunderstorms because pollen grains rupture when they come into contact with rainwater, which releases allergens that are then scattered by strong winds during the storm. Lead author Andrew Grundstein, a climatologist in the Department of Geography at the University of Georgia, said, “While a 3-percent increase in risk may seem modest, asthma is quite prevalent in Atlanta, and a modest relative increase could have a significant public health impact for a region with more than 5 million people.” Stefanie Ebelt Sarnat of Emory added, “Obtaining a better understanding of the mechanistic basis of the phenomenon of thunderstorm-induced asthma will allow for better intervention strategies and improved emergencies services planning.” Understanding Lightning Researchers at the University of Florida (UF) and the Florida Institute of Technology (FIT) recently were able to use electric field and X-ray detectors to search for the source of X-rays generated by lightning. Their goal is to be able to predict where lightning will strike. The researchers showed that as lightning moves from cloud to ground, the X-rays are emitted at the beginning of each step leader, which is the path of ionized air that creates a return storke channel. “Nobody understands how lightning makes X-rays,” said Martin Uman, a professor of electrical and computer engineering, adding, “it’s obviously happening. And we have put limits on how it’s happening and where it’s happening.” In 2002, UF/FIT researchers showed that the negatively charged leader is what produces the X-rays. In the most recent study, UF/FIT researchers further narrowed the source of X-rays down to the beginning of each step in the step leader. Understanding how lightning moves is key to one day making predictions about lightning strikes. The possibility could help researchers develop better lightning protection systems. “A spark that begins inside a thunderstorm somehow manages to travel many miles to the ground, where it can hurt people and damage property,” said Joseph Dwyer, a professor in the Department of Physics and Space Sciences at FIT. He added, “Now, for the first time, we can actually detect lightning moving toward the ground using X-rays. So just as medical X-rays provide doctors with a clearer view inside patients, X-rays allow us to probe parts of the lightning that are otherwise very difficult to measure.” The study was published in the online edition of the American Geophysical Union’s Geophysical Research Letters. No More April Showers Could the American Southwest get any hotter and drier? It could and already is, say researchers from the University of Arizona (UA) in Tucson. In a study published in the American Geophysical Union’s Geophysical Research Letters, the researchers write that the northward shift of the westerly winds is bringing less rain and snow in the springtime. The researchers compared the month-to-month winter storm track, temperature, and precipitation records for the western United States as well as pressure at different levels of the atmosphere from 1978 to 1998. They found that changes in late-winter precipitation in the western United States are related to changes in the storm track path. “We used to have this season from October to April where we had a chance for a storm. Now it’s from October to March,” said Stephanie A. McAfee, a doctoral candidate in the UA’s department of geosciences. The study is the first to make this connection between the poleward movement of the storm track—which has been documented for decades—and the changing storm pattern in the Southwest. The occurrence affects Southern California, Arizona, Nevada, Utah, western Colorado, and western New Mexico. “During the period it’s raining less, it also tends to be warmer than it used to be,” said McAfee. Researchers fear the earlier occurrence of heat and dryness will have an impact on snowpack, hydrological processes, and water resources. Blame Ike In a strange case of a hurricane actually improving someone’s life instead of causing destruction and sorrow, Marlow Wayne Reynolds has Ike to thank for a brief stint of freedom he experienced in early September. Reynolds, who received a 40-year term for murder and several other charges in 2004, escaped from prison in Brazoria, Texas, on September 9, just days before Hurricane Ike hit the region. While residents were evacuating and authorities were focused on the hurricane, Reynolds managed to stay on the run for three weeks. With the help of several witnesses, he was finally found hiding in the woods near the San Bernard River and captured on September 28.Nigeria is the most populous country in Africa. The 2006 provisional census counted over 140 million people (United Nations 2007), 64 percent of whom live in rural areas. These rural areas are undergoing radical, noticeable change, particularly in the agricultural sector. The agricultural sector is increasingly market-oriented and has seen a diversification of income opportunities and an increasing division of labor. It is therefore important to have a highly efficient rural service sector that fosters agricultural productivity and development outcomes. However, access to rural services, has only had marginal impacts in the agricultural sector. Rural households, therefore, continue to face poor access to agricultural and social services. These gaps in rural service provision need to be closed in order to enable the countryside to mobilize its development potential.
To distinguish rural from urban development, one must define “rural.” Demographers classify a population as rural based on the size or occupational distribution of residents and the geographical characteristics of the area. Most definitions consider an area rural if people work or live on farms. The number of residents in a population considered rural differs from less than 2000 (Reardon et al. 2001) to less than 5001 (Acemoglu et al. 2001) to less than 10,000 people (International Fund for Agricultural Development 2001). In Nigeria, areas with populations above 20,000 are considered urban, meaning that rural areas have sizes below this cut-off (Onokerhoraye 1984).
Decentralization has become a key issue in development policy in the last two decades. Decentralization is a process of transitioning from a governance structure in which power is concentrated at the central or national level to one in which authority to make decisions and implement them is shifted to lower level governments or agencies. It consists of a transfer of public functions from higher tiers to lower tiers of governance.My Love Affair with the F-word.
A that we all need to have a vice to help us stay humble and human while aspiring to be better. Mine is definitely swearing as sometimes it is the only way to fully express the feeling in the moment. So a few F bombs amongst a clean living life is not the end of the world.
Definitely. I also think that so many things have a place in life. We can get too dogmatic about what clean living is and forget to live. Glad you enjoyed the article Caitlin.
Fuck yeah… I completely relate! Thank you for being real!
Ha! Thanks for reading Carrie.
OK, Abe Lincoln once said that folks with few vices have few virtues, so maybe swearing is a good thing, but in my opinion the word fuck is the lazyman's noun, verb, adverb, adjective, and so on. When someone says something was really fucking great, they have not said anything. They might as well have grunted their pleasure about whatever it was. They have not articulated an emotion or observation in any meaningful way, just used fuck as a catchall. If I say, fuck, that hurt, you catch my drift, but again, I might as well have moaned as spoken words about it. Just my 2 fucking cents.
Edward, I think you have a point, in that relying on any word, including the f-bomb, makes language ineffective. When used with some thought though, it can be quite potent.
Sometimes it is definitely the most appropriate word, that is for sure!
Enjoyed this, Katrina. Thanks.

Thanks Bob! Glad it was worthwhile to you.
I am so there. Sometimes it really is all that needs to be said. Just sums so much up. Especially my favorite usage – "fuck off" Just perfect so often
Nice!
It was just yesterday I need a Fuck refresher… here let me fucking share.
Nice one Katrina!
I do think it's a matter of consciousness. We bring that to all our words, not just the four letter ones. How many times is the question "how are you doing?" asked, then answered consciously? We echo the mundane reply 'I'm fine and you?' or some other rhetoric when I yearn for a more conscious call and response…. 'What keeps you going day after day of minimal sleep with a smile on your face?' 'I am driven by the love a Mother has for her child.'
How am I doing? I'm pretty fucking tired thanks for asking! But really I know this too will pass and I want to cherish every moment; exciting and mundane.
Ms. Txx
Well said Tara!
interesting…. I disagree.
You can absolutely do that Cathy.
I wonder, though, in what way do you disagree? Do you have a perspective to share that can shed some light on the subject?
"every sound carries vibration and that vibration makes up our world" from the article.
Or maybe research and reflect on the depth, meaning, intent of the feelings which need to be expressed by those swear words.. get a thesaurus! become more literate and learn to say things like,.. spectacular, glorious, tragic, hurtful, angering, shaming, bewildered, intensely angry, bitter, angst, furious, bewildered, offended, delayed, deliberately, hateful, intent..
be a healthy contributor to the range of human expression instead of relying on crude sometimes offending guttural intonations to express yourself.
For myself, the word 'fuck' is sometimes very passionately used. Nothing a thesaurus can help me find a better term for. Sometimes its not about 'finding' the right word, nor about someone's education. Sometimes is just fits, perfectly.
Precisely!
I checked back to see if you or anyone had read my comments..
Then I decided to read your bio and book info! Surprise! Not a f…k in the book or its description! You can write a well-developed sentence and a thoght out book with a sequence without resorting to " try the f..k fo rawhile and then another sh..t may occur. You can write without using swear words!
Of course I can Cathy.
My point wasn't that I need to use swear words, or even that I do so that often. It was that I give myself the freedom to include them when useful just like any other vocabulary. You notice I only said the f-word once in this article?
I think I love you… I so relate… and quite frankly, (I teach yoga), and sometimes even swear in class. Some may find this very inappropriate. although, you know what, my students love it & live it. Someone once gave me a book on Etiquette of Teaching, and one of my students literally said, 'throw that shit away". She also explained, that she loved that she come into a class, not too yuppy, not too trendy & that everyone was just being themselves, and yoga is not only about seemingly being perfect, but also about excepting who we are… and I am some who says 'fuck'… a lot! 😉
Thanks for this share… loved it. I particularly appreciated that you described the world in vibration through sound & I firmly believe that sometimes there is no better word to use than the word 'fuck'. In love making, in seeing a wonderful luminous rainbow, in pain, in awe… you get it… I know 'you' do!! 😉
Namaste!
Thanks for sharing Sheila. Your students appreciate you being real. Me too!
[…] To that, I blurted out in a relatively innocuous tone, “What are you? A p*ssy?” […]
Interesting topic. As I became more dedicated to the path over the last year, my use of 'certain words' actually increased. Why? Because I was loosening up – in SO many ways – including in regard to the rules I had for myself. Attractive, educated women from affluent neighborhoods…we don't cuss in public, right? Heaven forbid that someone might get the wrong idea about me or a man runs for cover when the S-word comes out of my mouth after a couple of beers (beer…a whole different topic).
I have actually found a certain kind of freedom is allowing myself to use profanity when I feel like it. However, I have made a conscious decision to reduce my use of it in general conversation – but only because I've decided that I don't like the way it sounds…not because of any 'rules'.
Namaste, and thanks for the post.
Yes! I relate completely to the process of giving myself more freedom as I progress on the path.
And I don't swear that often in conversation with others… Except those closest to me. But not my Mom and Dad.
Namaste, and thanks for reading!
I am also known as the swearing yogi… The F-word sometimes puts just the right kinda energy into the story of what is being told… Laughter was had by all.
Laughter is good!
I like this article….but did not like the leading pic….could have done better….because I have a great t-shirt that is my alter ego….that would have worked well for this post…
As one partner said, the f word says it all quite succiently…. and you cannot get better than that. In the English language…there really is yet to be another word that is an equal match..
It was hard to choose a pic for this one Heather. I actually left it up to my editor and think she did a decent job at finding something controversial to match the subject. Unfortunately we didn't have access to that t-shirt of yours.
Thanks for reading. Glad you enjoyed.” […]A man charged with sex offences faked his own suicide and fled to the other side of the world.
Idwal Glyn Jones panicked when he was charged with touching the breasts of an 11-year-old girl.
He left his clothes, shoes and some pills at the edge of a deep lake at Dorothea quarry in Gwynedd , sparking a major police air and under water search for his body.
But investigations showed that he was alive and well – and he ended up living in Thailand for almost ten years. Today he was back in court to face the music.
He appeared from custody at Mold Crown Court after he was extradited under an European arrest warrant.
But despite everything he had done to try and get out of it, a judge told him that the guidelines did not suggest a prison sentence, and he walked free.
Judge David Hale said he also took into account that the defendant had been in custody since last August – some months in a Thai prison where he was said to have little food and was shackled at night.
Jones, 57, who in 2004 lived at Plas Gwernoer, Nantlle but was now described as no fixed abode, admitted two charges of sexual activity with a child back in 2004.
He was placed on a three year community order with supervision and a community sex offender group work programme.
Jones must register with the police as a sex offender for five years and a five year SOPO (Sexual Offences Prevention Order) was made.
Judge Hale branded Jones “an extremely stupid and foolish man” for giving in to temptation and touching the child as he did on two occasions.
“It has had a profound effect upon her,” he said.
“You were sufficiently scared to fake your own suicide at considerable public expense in terms of the time spent searching for you at the time,” Judge Hale said.
But you had gone to Thailand where you lived for ten years.
He had been arrested last August and had spent time in a Thai prison which he accepted had not been pleasant.
The offences were aggravated by the profound effect on the victim and the allegation that he had shown her a pornographic film at the time.
But under the guidelines he could not impose a custodial sentence – certainly not of any longer length than he had already served.
The judge said that the case high-lighted the indirect effect on victims of such offences.
The defendant and others may have regarded it as simply touching – but the victim impact statement showed the wider effects.
The victim, now in her early 20s, had told how her mother became more protective of her after what had happened, and she had rebelled which had caused all sorts of difficulties.
Prosecuting barrister Andrew McInnes said that in the summer of 2004 the victim disclosed that the defendant had deliberately touched and fondled her breasts on two occasions.
Police went to his home and arrested him, when cautioned he said “Oh my God” and refused to be interviewed.
He was bailed pending a full interview with the victim but then on August 7, 2004, the defendant’s clothing, shoes and a bottle of his prescribed tablets were found scattered about at Dorothea Quarry.
It appeared that the defendant had taken his own life and police spent a number of days searching the area with a helicopter and the lake with an underwater search team.
He failed to answer his bail two days later but investigations showed that he had fled to Thailand and his partner and children followed him there at one stage.
In 2011 an European arrest warrant was issued, it was served on the Thai Ministry of Foreign Affairs and he was arrested on August 2 last year.
More than 700 indecent images of children had been found on his computer back in 2004 but he had not been extradited for that and could now not be prosecuted for those, Mr McInnes explained.
Brett Williamson, defending, said that his client was a man of good character who had spent 227 days in custody.
His time in a Thai jail had not been easy – he had been shackled at night and had been given limited food which consisted of rice.
The defendant was remorseful, he had hope for the future, was willing to comply with any orders of the court and unlike many such offenders was now, belatedly, facing up to what he had done.Dance Proms 2012

Doug E. Fresh at The Orbit Room
If you’ve ever heard someone beat box, you can thank rapper, record producer, and the “Human Beat Box” who popularized the technique: Doug E. Fresh.
Fresh and the Get Fresh Crew were among hip-hop's founders in the ‘80s, and he most recently made a small comeback as his signature dance moves were featured in the 2010 hit “Teach Me How to Dougie” from the rap group Cali Swag District.
The 21-and-older concert will take place at 8 p.m. Friday, April 18, at The Orbit Room, 2525 Lake Eastbrook Blvd. SE. Tickets are $25 in advance, $30 the day of the show, at the box office, Ticketmaster or online at orbitroom.com.
Actors’ Theatre's “God of Carnage”
This 90-minute play about two couples who meet after a playground fight between their respective children shows what happens when civilized people give way to their less-than-polite instincts and allow the “God of Carnage” to reign free.
The cracks in the veneer of social politeness deepen and finally give way in this comedy about what happens when half-hearted diplomacy fails. The play, originally penned in French by Yasmina Reza, won the 2009 Tony Award for Best Play. The Broadway rendition starred the late James Gandolfini along with Jeff Daniels, Marcia Gay Haden and Hope Davis.
The six-show run is on Thursdays through Saturdays from April 17-26 at 8 p.m. at Spectrum Theatre, 160 Fountain St. NE, on the campus of Grand Rapids Community College.
Tickets are $24-$26 online at actorstheatregrandrapids.org or 616-234-3946.

December 8, 2011-- Home Textiles Today,
Dalton, Ga. - Area rug house Kaleen has named Grey Christie its new regional vp for the north region, a promotion from his prior post as national accounts manager.
Still based here out of the company's U.S. headquarters, Christie reports to Joe Barkley, evp.
Since 2009, Christie has served as the national accounts manager at Kaleen, which is owned and operated by the Rathi family and is celebrating its 15th year in business in the U.S.
Prior to that stint, Christie was territory manager in the mid-south region. And earlier in his career, he worked in sales positions within the industry on the West Coast and in the New England region.
Christie is closing in on 20 years of career experience in the rug industry.
"Grey's attitude and work ethic are contagious," said Barkley. "He has gained respect in the industry for being extremely knowledgeable and experienced in all aspects of sales, this experience will provide great opportunities for Kaleen to continue the positive growth experienced over the past decade".

Are the manufacturers in cohorts with the dry cleaning industry to extort additional funds from me? This thinking has caused me to damage articles of clothing that would have been nicely preserved if I had only heeded the instruction shown on the care label.
For example, this past winter I purchased a nice leather biker jacket. Any fashionista knows that they must have at least one biker jacket in their wardrobe. Against instruction, I designated myself as a leather cleaning expert, immersed the jacket in a tub of water, and proceeded to clean it with cold water wash. After letting it drip dry for days, it became a shrunken jacket which left me with elbow pain. Did I learn my lesson? No! I found another leather jacket and threw it in a tub of water as well. Luckily, it turned out fine.

Who Watches the Watchmen?
CBS and the Boston Globe have decided if you can't dazzle them with your brilliance, baffle them with your B.S. Put your waders on boys and girls, because it's getting deep around here.
Dan Rather's response on national TV: "Today, on the internet and elsewhere, some people -- including many who are partisan political operatives -- concentrated not on the key questions the overall story raised but on the documents that were part of the support of the story." I have to question Dan Rather's news judgement (please note, not his patriotism), since he thinks allegations of activity that wasn't either illegal or unethical that happened 30 years ago is far more important than allegations of outright fraud that happened 2 days ago.
I can almost see the thought bubbles above Dan Rather's head "must tough it out -- if I can just tough it out long enough, it will all go away." Since I'm not a journalist, I won't go the extra mile and claim I really can see them.
CBS put on the lamest defense: an expert witness on handwriting who has said in the past that you can't positively authenticate a signature from a photocopy. Well, guess what, he positively authenticated a signature from a photocopy. CBS had no expert on documents themselves though -- not that they've named yet. As I said before, if they can't name one, can't produce his or her work, I have to doubt they exist. There's far more evidence for Santa Claus than there is that CBS did a thorough investigation of these documents.
The Boston Globe took up the slack on that and announced that a top expert on documents authenticated the documents. This one will blow your mind. They used the expert that Bill at INDC first contacted and who said 90% chance of forgery. After a Globe reporter talked with Dr. Bouffard, they ran the following headline:
Authenticity backed on Bush documents
OK, we can all get back to pummelling President Bush for his actions 30 years ago. Well, not so fast. It seems the good Dr. is "pissed" at the Globe for misrepresenting his views. What he told them was that he was still looking into it, getting more information, somethings he thought at first weren't quite true, and he was still considering it. But he still thinks the documents are most likely forgeries.
The guys at Powerline are ahead of the curve on all this (why not, they've been at the head of the pack so far) and have come out with a great idea:
"The next question is, how old are the "first-generation" copies that CBS has? If those copies, based on testing the paper, are themselves twenty or thirty years old, it would add considerable plausibility to the claim that there were, in fact, authentic originals, even if those originals cannot now be recovered. But I'll bet they're not. I'll bet that if tested, the CBS copies would be very, very recent. (I don't know how precise dating of paper can be. If any readers are experts in this, let us know.) So, here is the bottom line: if the CBS copies are recent, then the alleged originals were recently in existence. So where are they? Were they recently destroyed? If so, why and by whom?
If CBS would make its purported first-generation copies available for testing, it could go a long way toward verifying their authenticity, or--much more likely--proving that they are recently-created fakes.
One loophole in this approach: a clever forger could obtain thirty-year old paper, and use it to create the fake memos. So if the originals (or CBS' copies) are on old paper, it wouldn't necessarily prove they are authentic (they could, of course, have been forged long ago, but it's hard to see why anyone would have done that). But if CBS's copies are new, and they can't explain what happened to the originals, it would be the last nail in Dan Rather's coffin.
So let's get CBS's copies and test the paper.
I wouldn't worry about that clever forger too much - nothing has been particularly clever about it so far.
Wouldn't it be nice to put the whole sorry mess in front of an investigative inquiry, put everybody under oath, have CBS and the Globe put all their cards on the table, and get to the bottom of this? Maybe Lord Hutton is available. After all, when Hutton spoke, heads rolled.Posted by Kevin Murphy at September 11, 2004 3:51 PM | Media Criticism 17: Go Dylan Go

"I wake up at 7 a.m. I shower, shave, eat breakfast, and have a double espresso, a cigarette, vitamins, and supplements."
"Then I lift weights at the gym; I rarely do cardio. When I'm in Paris, I love to walk through the Champ de Mars."
What Do You Think?I just returned from a recent trip to Rats Glass. We had to pick up a 32 roadster body for a customer and I took a few pictures during our visit. Bob Brace, Cruisin Products. I had to pick up a 32 roadster body for one of my customers and I took a few moments to talk with George and take a few pictures. We were concerned about George and Rats Glass because we (Cruisin’ Products) displayed at Goodguys in Columbus this year and Rats Glass wasn't there. The reason George wasn't there is because of an accident that laid him up for a little while. George is an avid bicycle rider. He rides on average about 200 miles a week. While participating in a group ride, a rider went down and took a few riders with him. George was one of those collaterally damaged riders. That was just before the Goodguys event. His injuries prevented him from traveling to the event. George (a.k.a. Rat) and Bob Brace I'm happy to report that George and Rats Glass are now doing just fine. Our industry has suffered a little this past year due to the economy but, Rats Glass is not one of them. I took a few pictures around the complex and talked with George about his business. George is on solid ground. He solely owns everything at Rats Glass. No landlords, banks or other creditors to satisfy on a monthly basis. He and his workers are dealing with a 7 body back log on their build schedule. George tries to keep one body of each model he offers in stock. He showed me the area where he stores the various body styles and the picture shows a cross section of the various body styles in different stages waiting to be finished. He admits that certain bodies sell as fast as they are finished and some have him backlogged. George indicated to me that if anything, his business has increased. If you are in the market for a composite body , you need to talk to Rats Glass. Contact George at Rats Glass (865) 995-2756 or visit their website at for information and pricing on the bodies they build. Gallery Type: Shop Toursthumbimage:

My anvil came from from Thak.ca, which was good for me because I'm in canada, so the shipping ended up being only about $50 for 110 kg anvil.
I would recommend finding a dealer who is at least local to your country, to save on shipping. And also if they are close enough that you can pay them a visit and check out their products before you buy, that is a very good idea.
Also, never buy an anvil from china. Even a little jewelry one. I've heard horror stories about chinese made anvils cracking open, revealing sand or lead inside.... Written by Frank Dabelstein <frank@dabelstein.dk>
Silent film may be the only unique art form ever to have flourished and then become extinct. The great ironyindeed, tragedyof its demise is that it reached its peak only in the last few years before the talkie revolution. Silent films from 1927 through 1930 dazzle with their fluid and sophisticated mastery of visual storytelling; the last thing they need is dialogue. F.W. Murnau's City Girl is a perfect example of this artistry, and what happened to it. The follow-up to Murnau's legendary masterpiece Sunrise, City Girl was made during the waning days of silents, and in a concession to the changeover to sound it was re-cut before its release and given a recorded score featuring singing farmhands. Not surprisingly, the hybrid film sank like a stone. Miraculously, an original silent print survived and was rediscovered in the vaults at 20th Century-Fox. I first saw it at the National Film Theatre in London during a Murnau retrospective. I'd never heard of it, but when I went to see Nosferatu the speaker introducing it added, "Be sure to come back next week and see City Girlit's better than Sunrise!" This claim would be very hard to defend, but while lacking the transcendence of Sunrise, City Girl is in some ways a more complex and interesting work.
It also defends the honor of city girls from the laughably caricatured vamp who causes all the trouble in Sunrise. Like the earlier film, City Girl deals with the clash between urban and rural values, but here the countryside is no more pure or wholesome than the city. Unlike the vague, timeless setting of Sunrise, City Girl's milieu is the contemporary American Midwest. Kate (Mary Duncan) is a waitress in a busy Chicago lunchroom who lives in a dreary tenement and dreams of escaping the city. She meets Lem (Charles Farrell), a naïve and sweet-natured farm boy who has been sent to the city to sell his family's wheat crop. They fall in love, marry, and set out for the wheat-fields. But Kate's dreams are shattered by Lem's harsh, tyrannical father (David Torrence), and she finds herself waiting on rowdy, leering farmhands who are even worse than the lunchroom customers. Kate loses faith in Lem when he is unable to stand up to his father, and the marriage appears to be over almost before it began, until a series of melodramatic events force the various characters to examine their true motives and feelings.
Every aspect of this story is expressed through visual details. We are introduced to Lem on the train to Chicago, eating hand-packed sandwiches, oblivious to the flirtations of a vamp across the aisle whose interest is aroused by his bankroll (we know right off this isn't going to be Sunrise II.) We see Kate sassily quashing passes from customers ("What do you do in the evenings?" "YOU'LL never know!") and we see her in her dingy little room, watering a pathetic dusty flower on the fire-escape and listening to a wind-up mechanical bird while the El rushes past the window. The sweaty, chaotic bustle of the lunchroom is captured with tremendous verve. Once the scene moves to the country, the symbolism of wheat becomes the heart of the film (which Murnau wanted to call "Our Daily Bread.") In a ravishing scene, the newlyweds run through a glistening, swirling field of grain; when they arrive at the house, Lem's little sister greets Kate with a bouquet of wheat stalks. When the dour father enters, he rebukes her for wasting their cash crop; to him grain only means money. He also notices that Kate has put her cloche hat down on the family bible, and he is convinced that she's a floozy who sees Lem as a gravy train.
The Torrence brothers, David and Ernest, specialized in hissable nastiness, but here David's worried, American Gothic face conveys the hard life that has turned this man into a monster. It's hard to believe he could be genetically linked to a sweet-faced, curly-haired cutie like Charles Farrell, but he does make Lem's anguished weakness believable. Mary Duncan is perfect as a feisty yet vulnerable working girl, a type that would become much more common in early talkies. Duncan left the screen in 1933 when she married a polo player named "Laddie" Sanford. She lived to be 98, but her retirement was Hollywood's loss. I would like to see this intelligent, natural, black-eyed actress in something else.
City Girl is marred by an ending that feels rushed and unconvincing, but it raises interesting, at times troubling themes concerning marriage, traditional gender roles and family relationships. The most poignant aspect of this exquisitely directed film is not that it was one of the last silent movies made in Hollywood, but that its director would die in a car crash just three years later, at the age of forty-two. That was cinema's loss..

WISH is located in the historic Art Deco hotel called "The Hotel" in the heart of South Beach. One of executive chef Andrea Curto’s signature dishes is this tangy goat cheese tart.
FOR THE DOUGH:
In the bowl of a standing mixer with the paddle attachment, add the flour. On low speed, beat in the butter until it resembles a coarse meal. Add the salt and enough water to make the dough come together in a ball. Wrap the dough in plastic wrap and refrigerate for at least 1 hour.
FOR THE FILLING:
In a large skillet over medium-high heat, add the oil and mushrooms. Cook, stirring often, until all of the liquid released from the mushrooms has evaporated. Set aside until cool enough to handle. Use a kitchen towel to squeeze out the excess moisture.
In a mixing bowl, combine the goat cheese, eggs, garlic, chives, thyme, cream and mushrooms. Season to taste with the salt and pepper. Cover and refrigerate until ready to use.
Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F.
Remove the dough from the refrigerator and allow it to soften slightly and gently shape the dough into a rectangle. On a lightly floured surface, roll the dough out to an 11-inch by 15-inch rectangle and gently ease it into a 9-inch by 13-inch baking sheet. Turn the excess dough into the pan and gently press with your fingers to create the tart's edge. Pierce the bottom of the crust all over with the tines of a fork to prevent the dough from rising unevenly during baking. Line the tart shell with foil or parchment paper, and weigh it down with pastry weights or dried beans. Bake the pastry for 20 to 25 minutes, or until the pastry just begins to turn tan and the rim is golden. Lift the foil or parchment paper and weights or beans from the tart and bake 5 to 7 minutes more, or until the crust is completely set. Place the crust on a rack to cool slightly. Do not turn the oven off.
Into the cooled crust, spread the goat cheese mixture out evenly. Bake the tart for 25 minutes, or until the cheese begins to turn golden.
TO SERVE:
Place a slice of tart on top of a bed of mesclun greens and garnish the plate with the pickled beets and spiced walnuts.

Found a dirty q-tip on the floor; tells me they didn't clean well...vacuum would pick that up....The lengthy and ultimately fruitless attempts to knock Island Lake Mayor-elect Charles Amrich and Trustee-elect Tony Sciarrone off last month's ballot cost the village nearly $44,125 in legal fees, records show.
Lawyers with the Ancel, Glink, Diamond, Bush, DiCianni and Krafthefer firm represented the local electoral board that heard a pair of cases against Amrich. They also handled the cases and related issues in Lake County circuit court.
Contact information ( * required )
The firm prepared for the Sciarrone case, too, but the matter was dropped before it could be heard by the electoral board.
The cases took three months to resolve.
Last week, Ancel Glink's lawyers resigned from village service before they could be sacked by the new administration. The departure is effective this Thursday, the day Amrich will take office.
The bills for the electoral work, which were acquired by the Daily Herald under the Freedom of Information Act, accounted for more than 30 percent of what the village has been charged for legal services so far this year, records show.
The total outraged the mayor-elect.
"It's the taxpayers' money," said Amrich, who defeated incumbent Debbie Herrmann to win the job he held from 1985 to 2005. "I think it's unfair, I really do."
Ancel Glink attorney Keri-Lyn Krafthefer called the bills unavoidable.
"Once an objection is filed, the village has no choice but to convene the electoral board," Krafthefer said in an email. "There is simply nothing the village could have done, and no action the village board could have taken, to avoid these costs."
A long process
It's not uncommon for political activists to challenge the petitions of candidates they oppose -- but the situation in Island Lake this year was unusual in a few ways.
Most challenges end after a single electoral board hearing. After hearing testimony and reviewing documents, the board lets the candidate stay on the ballot or the candidate is removed, and that's that.
But Amrich had to fight for three months to stay on the ballot. He twice took his case to court after electoral boards ruled against him.
By the time a judge said his candidacy was legitimate, Election Day was less than a month away.
Herrmann would have been the lone mayoral candidate on the ballot if Amrich was ruled ineligible. She declined to comment for this story.
Island Lake residents Daniel Field and Louis Sharp were behind the effort to remove Amrich and Sciarrone from the ballot. Both men are business owners with financial ties to village hall.
Field has a municipal contract for computer services, while Sharp Towing is the first company the police department calls when it needs a vehicle removed from a local street. Sharp is a former trustee.
The men filed their first objections to the Amrich and Sciarrone candidacies in January. They argued the candidates were ineligible to run because of financial debts to the village.
An electoral board consisting of trustees Shannon Fox, Thea Morris and Laurie Rabattini knocked Amrich off the ballot after a hearing in early February. Only Rabattini sided with Amrich.
The case against Sciarrone was dropped the same night.
Krafthefer advised the electoral board during the Amrich hearing. Field and Sharp had their own attorney, as did Amrich.
Amrich appealed the ruling to Lake County court. A judge dismissed the case because Amrich's lawyer, David McArdle, didn't properly deliver vital paperwork in the matter. Krafthefer represented the village in court.
Days later, Amrich's slate mates appointed him to fill the vacancy on their team. Once again, Field and Sharp objected to his candidacy -- this time, they argued paperwork was filed late and improperly.
Another electoral board hearing was held in early March, and once more Krafthefer advised the panel. As it had before, the board sided with Field and Sharp and removed Amrich from the ballot with a 2-1 vote.
Amrich took the second case to court, too. On March 12, Judge Christopher Starck reversed the electoral board's ruling and said Amrich satisfied the legal requirements and could run.
As she had earlier, Krafthefer represented the village in court. She also handled a pair of procedural lawsuits stemming from the electoral board decisions.
Field and Sharp have appealed to the state Supreme Court. Ancel Glink's lawyers no longer are involved.
Despite the legal roadblocks, Amrich won the mayor's race with nearly 79 percent of the vote. All members of his slate won by similarly wide margins.
'They have to pay'
Ancel Glink's bills for the electoral board process covered paperwork preparation, review of emails, advice to the village clerk, correspondence, attendance at the board hearings, court appearances and a variety of other tasks.
The firm charged the village for 291 hours of work on the cases, documents revealed. That's more than 12 complete days of service.
Once the objections were filed, village officials had to convene electoral boards, Krafthefer said. And by their nature, those proceedings incur legal fees.
"The village did not cause the cost of the electoral board hearings -- nor did Ancel Glink," Krafthefer said. "But they have to pay for it."
Krafthefer suggested the bills could have been lower if Amrich's attorney filed his paperwork correctly the first time or if either side opted not to fight the matter in court.
Throughout their campaign, Amrich and his allies complained about the village's bills from Ancel Glink, which have totaled hundreds of thousands of dollars in recent years and tower above the legal fees of most other Lake County communities.
Amrich had pledged to dump Ancel Glink if elected. The associated costs of the firm's work during the electoral-board process added fuel to the already blazing fire.
Amrich called the village's $44,125 tab "ridiculous."
"I honestly believe that the objectors, Sharp and Field, should be paying for this," Amrich said.
Field was surprised by the size of the legal bills, too. Still, he defended his efforts to remove Amrich from the ballot.
"There are rules in place for a reason," Field said in an email.
Sharp declined to comment.
Amrich estimated he and Sciarrone had to pay their lawyers about $20,500 to handle the cases. One attorney donated at least some of his legal services, according to state campaign disclosure repots. Other legal services were billed to Amrich's campaign committee and will be paid with political donations, records indicate.
Amrich said he supports recently proposed state legislation that would have a county-level electoral board consider objections in municipal, school and township races. That would eliminate any local political bias on the panel, proponents have said. It also would take the financial burden off the local government.
And that's what really burns Amrich.
"It's just sad they had to waste the village's money for no reason at all," he said., all masts and rigging removed w/ a tug preparing to the tow to Boston.

In this appeal, the Court of Appeals affirms the family court's decision to impute additional income to the husband for purposes of wife's temporary and permanent alimony awards, to award permanent alimony to wife, and to exclude certain pre-separation debts from the marital estate. Because of the Court of Appeal's finding regarding temporary alimony, it reversed the portion of the family court's order that found husband's overpayment of temporary alimony negated his requirement to pay his wife's attorney's fees and costs.4826 - C-Sculptures v. Brown
The Browns appeal the circuit court's confirmation of an arbitration award to C-Sculptures arguing the arbitrator manifestly disregarded the law on contractor licensing and the right to enforce a contract. The Browns further appeal the award of attorney's fees to C-Sculptures arguing C-Sculptures improperly manipulated its pleadings and prayer for relief to position itself as the prevailing party.

Elise Burke arrived at AnMed to have an abdominal hysterectomy on March 22, 2005. During a routine preoperative procedure, a nurse inadvertently left a cleansing sponge inside Ms. Burke's body. The hysterectomy was performed later the same morning but the sponge was not discovered. After the surgery, Ms. Burke experienced increasing discomfort, discolored vaginal discharge, and an offensive odor she was unable to prevent those around her from noticing. Over the following two months, Ms. Burke contacted her doctor on six separate occasions seeking medical assistance to address these concerns. On May 23, 2005, Ms. Burke's doctor performed a vaginal exam and discovered fragments of the sponge that had been left in her body. AnMed Health admitted liability to Elise Burke arising out of the preoperative procedure, and the jury returned a $250,000.00 verdict for Ms. Burke. AnMed contends the trial court erred in refusing to excuse for cause potential jurors who were allegedly indebted to AnMed, in admitting costs of Ms. Burke's initial operation as evidence of damages, and in refusing to grant AnMed's motion for a new trial. We affirm.4829 - Steinmetz v. American Media Services
American Media Services, LLC, and several limited liability companies (collectively AMS) it created to upgrade radio stations appeal an arbitration award in favor of Mark S. Steinmetz. We dismiss AMS's appeal.4830 - State v. Mill.4831 - Matsell v. Crowfield Plantation

ManU, Aon Agree On $270M Deal To Change Name Of Carrington Training Base
Published April 9, 2013

CLICK ON ONE OF THESE BUTTONS
MAKING A COMMITMENT: In London, Duncan Robinson reported the Aon deal is worth almost double the $120M the group spent on the four-year deal to sponsor ManU’s shirts in '09. One insider said, “It’s a substantial commitment.” Aon CMO Phil Clement said, “We are continuing to invest very aggressively in the brand. We’ve gone from no brand awareness in countries like Japan and South Korea to incredible brand awareness. It’s been an explosion" (FINANCIAL TIMES, 4/8). The BBC's David Bond reported the move will "lead to concerns from some United supporters that the club's American owners, the Glazer Family, will now seek to cash in again by selling the lucrative naming rights for Old Trafford." However, ManU Exec Vice-Chair Ed Woodward insisted, "Old Trafford will not be sold." ManU sources added that the Glazers see Old Trafford as the "heart and soul" of the club and "do not want to do anything that might jeopardise that" (BBC, 4/8). In London, Simon Stone wrote the fact that ManU has “added friendly matches” into the contract is “intriguing as it means from their 2014 tour, they will be wearing two different companies on their kit” (INDEPENDENT, 4/8).
STICKING TO THE PLAN: In London, Rory Smith wrote, "Such commercial deals are a core part of the ownership strategy" implemented by the Glazer family when they took over in '05. United "now have partners for everything" -- Concha y Toro do the alcoholic beverages, Honda the motorcycles and Mr. Potato the savory snacks, and the joke doing the rounds on Twitter Monday was that even Manager Alex Ferguson’s "famed hairdryer would soon be brought to you by Babyliss." What is in the deals for the club’s commercial partners "is not immediately clear, but that does not appear to make the prospect of a tie-in with one of the world’s most recognisable brands any the less appealing." But what is in it for the owners and the club "is more obvious." The $180M in sponsorship and merchandising revenue allows the club "to go toe-to-toe with the likes of [Manchester] City and Chelsea, although some way short of Bayern Munich, the leaders in the field" (LONDON TIMES, 4/9).Spring 2007

HOUSTON (ICIS)--DuPont shut down its Orange cracker in Texas on Friday, following a lightning strike, the company said in a public filing.
The US company has 680,000 tonnes/year of ethylene capacity at the site.
A DuPont spokesperson could not be immediately contacted for comment.
News of the shutdown came as ethylene prices surged on Friday.
Ethylene for July traded as high as to 59.50 cents/lb, erasing losses from the previous sessions and leaving the monomer with an average gain of 1% forI started thinking about the topic of whether I should be censoring my 14-year old daughter’s music this week when I was listening to the new Pink album, “The Truth about Love.” shit day. I was, however, taken aback by Pink’s song “Slut Like You.” Not that the song needs more explanation than the title provides, but basically Pink is out for a good time, and she doesn’t give a sh__ with whom.
My daughter likes a lot of the popular females on the radio today: Nicki Minaj, Ke$ha, Katy Perry. Common themes in their music are excessive drinking and sex with a healthy dose of swearing, hardly topics and language that most parents want their freshman daughters pondering. I started wondering if these songs and their contents have a negative influence on impressionable youngsters, in this case young girls. Should I be more vigilant about the music my daughter is allowed to listen to? Aren’t these artists—particularly females who could be potential role models—making casual sex and regular intoxication seem pretty routine?
Now might seem like a strange time for me to start worrying about this topic as my 14-year old is my fourth and youngest child and my third girl. I’ve never been big on imposing a lot of rules but prefer to just making tweaks when needed. I’ve been lucky that I haven’t needed to make too many over the years. Along these lines, I’ve never told any of the kids they weren’t allowed to listen to any particular music, and upon reflection this evening I decided not to change my stance. Why? Glad you asked.
1. These songs are everywhere: every radio station plays them, they’re the pump-up music before high school sporting events, the musical guests on Saturday Night Live play them, you hear them on Song Pop (I’m addicted)—they’re literally impossible to escape. If I try to restrict the music my teens listen to, they’ll be hearing the same songs somewhere else anyway, and I’ll just be the repressive parent who doesn tends toward Jack Johnson and older Bruce Springsteen, while my older girls have taken a shine to country. I love that they can find what they like, even if it doesn’t happen to be my choice.
3. They aren’t necessarily going to do what they hear in songs. I’m a middle aged mom who likes rap, but I have never shot anyone and I don’t sleep around. I understand that teenagers may be more impressionable than an old dog like me, but my experience with my older girls. Even if you keep your teenager from hearing about such things in music, they’re going to have an even closer look at it on an everyday basis. I don’t mean kids are getting drunk and fornicating in the halls, but from what I understand they may well be talking about it. I still yield a bit more influence over my kids than a pop star.
I’m glad I thought this through and am comfortable with my decision. I have two daughters in college, so I’m not completely new at this, and if I were to notice things moving off course I’d probably have to re-evaluate not just music choices but also many other things, as well. Until that day comes, I’ll let my daughter listen to what she wants.1973 Chevrolet Camaro Z28 Type LT sport coupe, Matching numbers, 350 engine LT1, 4 speed transmission M21 muncie, 373 posi rear...

What is apprenticeship?
A person enrolled in a formal training program that combines on-the-job training with related technical instruction. The program is designed to produce workers that are fully competent in all aspects of an occupation.
How do I create an apprentice program?
Both state and federal apprenticeship laws allow employers to design their own program that provides an individual with specific skills, training, and job related instruction that are tailored to the company’s needs.
In order for an apprenticeship program to be recognized and considered "bona fide":
- The program must be approved by the Minnesota Department of Labor and Industry or the United States Department of Labor;
- there must be a written contract between the apprentice and the sponsor approved by the Minnesota Department of Labor and Industry or the United States Department of Labor;
- the apprentice must be registered with the Minnesota Department of Labor and Industry or the United States Department of Labor; the contract must clearly define the length of training, which includes the number of hours, an outline of the skills to be learned and the compensation that the apprentice will receive.
What are the apprenticeship requirements?
If a contractor’s apprenticeship program is "bona fide", an apprentice is not subject to the state and/or federal wage decisions incorporated into a contract, provided the contractor can demonstrate the following:
- The apprentice is performing the work of his/her trade;
- the apprentice is registered with the Minnesota Department of Labor and Industry or the United States Department of Labor;
- the apprentice is compensated according to the rate specified in the program for the level of progress;
- The ratio of apprentices to journeyman workers on the project is not greater than the ratio permitted for the contractor's entire work force under the registered program.
If a contractor fails to comply with the terms of the apprentice requirements mentioned above or fails to provide proof of a "bona fide" program, the contractor shall compensate the laborer or mechanic not less than the applicable total prevailing wage rate for the actual work performed and for all hours worked.
What are the apprenticeship ratio requirements?
In the absence of a defined ratio, which means the number of apprentices to journeymen, the Minnesota Apprenticeship Advisory Council allows one apprentice for the first journeyman and one additional apprentice for each additional three journeymen; therefore, the ratio on projects funded in whole or in part with state and/or federal funds would be as follows:
To verify whether or not a worker is a registered apprentice, contact the Minnesota Department of Labor and Industry's Apprenticeship Division at 651-284-5191. To find out more about apprenticeship programs, visit Minnesota Department of Labor and Industry's Apprenticeship. Visit the Resources page for more information.

The publisher announced today that it will add 300 new jobs to the facility, which was unveiled in 2010, and opened last September. Currently, the center employs around 400 individuals.
The facility--officially called the European Customer Experience Centre of Excellence--was established with the sole purpose of providing customer support for BioWare's Star Wars: The Old Republic. That has now changed, with the facility providing multilingual support (16 languages in total) and services for "major titles." These were not named.
"In today’s fast-moving digital environment, we need to engage with our worldwide customer base on a 24/7 basis, across all of EA's games and services and in multiple languages," EA COO Peter Moore said in a statement.
Moore further explained that Galway remains a hotspot for EA because it has an attractive fusion of technology infrastructure and talent availability, as well as a "pro-business" environment.
I live in Galway, why then is it necessary for me to contact the US to get help for my account??? EA help center is so awful. I tried their chat in an attempt to solve my problem. They directed me to their specialized team, who put me on hold for over an hour (probably costing a fortune) and then directed me back to the chat! 6 months and the issue still isn't resovled. Good job EA, really good work.

Ireland really needed this. Good work EA.
i don't care if i was running out of money or even dying. i'd get a job at EA just so i could bring it down from the inside
As long as they produce games worth playing, I won't complain. Let's see what happens.
Leave it to EA to create jobs overseas instead of in it's own country (USA)... But then again, that's the new trend right? Hand the jobs over to people that will work for 5 cents an hour and sacrifice quality. Typical...
it's good that there are new jobs. But EA CREATING NEW 300 Jobs IN WHICH UNIVRESE? :)))))
I don't mean to be rude, but considering how heavy the accents on some irish can get, isn't opening customer support over there abit counter-intuitive?.
Jobs are badly needed in Ireland atm so this is quite good news

Those 300 more people will be happy that they can ride on the sinking ship for a while, then move on.
Perhaps these irish people will at least try to help you with your support requests instead of trying to get rid of you, but I think they're required to read EA's "how to extort our customers" manual first, then follow these rules.

Term limits are needed
I have to comment on Richard Rubin's March 14 Marin Voice column in opposition to term limits for the Marin supervisors.
Mr. Rubin does not address the elephant in the room.
The fact is a person that decides to run against a Marin Supervisor needs approximately $150,000 or more to be able to have a successful run against the highly entrenched supervisor.
This is what prevents supervisors from getting voted out no matter how they perform as well as usually be unopposed.
In the public sector, the performance of the supervisors would result in dismissal:
the $32 million computer fiasco
unsustainable pensions
the supervisors compliant acceptance of Association of Bay Area Governments' housing allocations when they knew they were not correct.
I am a Democrat, and fully support term limits be added to the ballot and let the voters decide if 12 years, rather than lifetime entrenched politicians with a poor track record, is better than the voting booth.

Free advice on transit
Our local transit system is spending money to figure out why people don't use the buses.
I can tell you — for free.
The buses are inconvenient and unreliable.
If you need to get somewhere in time, you'd better not count on them. It's hard to justify a bus ride when you have to leave 1.5 hours early for a trip that would take 15 minutes in the car, and there's a good chance the connecting bus won't show up.
If the buses are going to run only once an hour, they should at least make their connections. And if something does goes wrong with the connecting bus, there's no information.
Recently, my son waited from 12:30 p.m. until 2:10 p.m. at the transit center for the 12:40 Golden Gate Transit bus to Rohnert Park. There was no alert online, no phone number to call, nobody came by the station to inform folks that the buses were running more than an hour and a half late and no extra bus was put on the road to pick up the slack.
He just had to wait, and hope, that eventually something would show up.
Sadly, this is not uncommon.
The transit system treats its riders like second-class citizens.
And there's your reason people don't use it, in a nutshell.

Only a sophomore in the festival circuit, Pemberton Festival in scenic British Columbia had a slightly less problem-wrought run than the festival’s premiere back in 2008. 6 years of planning and reorganization appeared to work to great effect for the festival, which brought in headliners including Outkast, Kendrick Lamar, Frank Ocean and others for this year, on top of live comedy acts such as The Trailer Park Boys, Jay Chandrasekhar and Bob Saget. In the shadow of Mount Currie, 6 stages catered to nearly 20,000 attendees over the 5 day event, placing Pemberton Festival in an interesting position as a rival to other more established parties in the Pacific Northwest like Sasquatch Festival and Bumbershoot.
Kicking things off on Friday, Tyler, the Creator and the Golf Wang skate team hosted fans of Odd Future at a skate park within the festival grounds, to coincide with the release of a collaborative sneaker between Golf Wang and Vans. Shortly after, Tyler was joined on stage alongside Jasper Dolphin and Taco for a set filled with antics, setting the mood for the weekend early on. A TDE takeover occurred later that evening, with Kendrick Lamar arriving by chopper, leading up to Schoolboy Q’s late night set. Going forward into the second day, festival-goers filed out of their campsites in anticipation of Chance the Rapper, AraabMuzik, Deadmau5 and others on the slate. Largely a stranger to Canadian venues, Chance the Rapper was certainly an exclamation point on the weekend for many in attendance, delivering a performance that suggested Chance was just as excited as the fans to be there. Wrapping up the final day, big hitters like Outkast, Justice and Frank Ocean capped off the proceedings. Grammy-award winners and genre bending partners Andre 3000 and Big Boi moved through many of the tracks you would expect, including "B.O.B." and “Hey Ya”, with the always-enigmatic Andre wearing a one-piece jumpsuit emblazoned with “I Pray There is a God at the End of All This”, with an oversized dangling “SOLD” tag. Outkast closed their set with some final words to fans; “stank you smelly much, this is for y’all!”, before Frank Ocean was given the honour of the final performance slot of Pemberton Festival 2014. Frank was joined on stage by a record player, which he would sing along to as he dropped the needle, aided by a large screen of atmospheric visuals.

July 12, 2011 – The American Society for Biochemistry and Molecular Biology this week called for passage of federal legislation to establish a uniform regulatory landscape for the derivation and use of human embryonic stem cells.
Calling existing legislation “ambiguous” and citing and “the constant specter of judicial challenges” that researchers face, the society representing thousands of biomedical researchers insisted that the promises of embryonic stem cell research are in peril and the development of much-needed therapies and cures is being delayed.
The statement said the lack “of a cogent, unified federal policy … has resulted in a discouraging and obstructionist research environment that has dissuaded many scientists from entering the field while driving others to work abroad.”
Benjamin Corb, director of public affairs for ASBMB, emphasized that a recent poll by the advocacy group Research!America showed that almost 70 percent of Americans approve of embryonic stem cell research.
Also, he said, there have been two bipartisan congressional efforts in the past decade advancing legislation to boost federal funding for embryonic stem cell research, which paved the way for the Obama administration to issue a 2009 executive order increasing the number of stem cell lines eligible for federal funding.
ASBMB also recommended nullifying what is known as the Dickey-Wicker amendment, saying: “This onerous law, which prohibits federal funding for any research ‘in which a human embryo or embryos are destroyed,’ places ambiguous and unreasonable restrictions on human embryonic stem cell research, stifling progress and delaying the development of cures and treatments.”

The 25-year-old right-hander won on Monday, holding Miami to one run on six hits and three walks in five innings.
Hanson has struggled since the All-Star break. Despite winning both of his decisions, Hanson has posted a 7.45 earned run average with 16 walks in 19 1/3 innings over four starts.
The Braves recalled pitcher Cory Gearrin from Triple-A Gwinnett to take Hanson's spot on the roster.
Gearrin has appeared in two games for the Braves this season, allowing one run in 2 2/3 innings.
In 33 appearances for Gwinnett, Gearrin is 3-1 with a 1.27 ERA.I’s was Editor (and Co-Editor) of Liberal Democrat Voice from May 2007 to Jan 2015, and writes at The Collected Stephen Tall.
I’m a small blogger, and I want to be able to sign up for regulation – as Leveson wanted me to. I’m afraid this campaign, and these amendments if they succeed, will deny me that choice.
One of the side-effects of the relentless propaganda campaign run by sections of the press against these reforms is the people assume regulation will be compulsory, and that it means only sticks and no carrot.
In fact, Leveson intended, and the Royal Charter envisages, that regulation will be entirely voluntary. None of the bloggers who wrote to the Guardian will have to sign up.
The reason Leveson thinks people will be incentivised to sign up is the big carrot regulation offers – protection from costs in libel cases. The threat of libel, and the risk of having to pay lawyers’ costs for the other side, is by far the biggest chilling factor on the free speech of bloggers. Signing up for this is in my view a no-brainer, as long as regulation is free or very low cost for the small blogger.
In contrast, the risk of “exemplary damages” is hugely exaggerated. They’ll only be awarded if a blogger shows deliberate or reckless disregard for people’s rights, “of an outrageous nature”. In other words unless you’re deliberately and unjustifiably monstering someone, it ain’t gonna happen. And, by the way, if none of this ever happens, it’s worth noting that courts can give exemplary damages against bloggers in libel cases already, including those who signed the Guardian letter.
I support bloggers’ freedom to choose not to be regulated. It’ll be very disappointing if liberal democrats, whose leader has supported the Royal Charter, want to deny me the choice to access the benefits of self-regulation.
Stephen, we are well aware that you are against any regulation of the British press, but Lib Dem Voice is not a platform for you to carry out your own private campaigns, and I and many others would rather that you didnt use it as such. Thanks.
You will be well aware that most of those who are trying to scupper the proposed press regulation are not doing so because they have concerns about the fine details – they are doing so because they want it entirely destroyed. They want the freedom to be able to continue doing this:
“Trans woman commits suicide after being bullied by the Daily Mail”
You and some of the other “liberal” blog sites may well think you are joining a noble cause to try to modify the proposals, but dont be fooled. I suspect you are being treated as a “useful idiot” by the like of Guido Fawkes and Rupert Murdoch – giving them the cover they need to be able to say they have cross-party backing for their assault on ordinary people.
An interesting post about the purpose of LDV.
Tony Greaves
I agree with Cllr Wright.
Perhaps LDV editors should review the information available on the “About us” menu item, where it says that: “Our editorial line is neutral on matters of debate within the party and ….”
You can already be sued. The system would give a measure of protection in exchange for the burden of regulation. I’m struggling for logical reasons why a journalist/blogger would oppose this beyond hoping to take the Murdoch or Dacre shilling down the line.
@ Carl Gardner – I wouldn’t want to stop you. But you’re assuming you can join free of charge. The new self-regulation body will cost money and there is nothing in the legislation which says small sites will get it any cheaper than major publishers. I’ve no idea if a non-profit site like LibDemVoice would be able to afford to join yet, so you’ll excuse me if I hold back on the enthusiasm.
@ Cllr Mark Wright – you’re pro-Charter/regulation, and I’m anti. I get it. But your comment doesn’t engage with the concerns being expressed here at all. These are concerns expressed by folk like Sunny Hundal, Mark Ferguson and Laurence Durnan (all of them pro-Leveson). They are also concerns expressed by Hacked Off — to quote from their own press release which I linked to in my piece:
So if we’re “useful idiots” then we’re in very good company. For the record, btw, I consulted my LDV editorial colleagues before signing in the site’s name.
@ Richard Dean – The letter specifically recognises that its signatories disagree on the substance of the post-Leveson legislation so I was comfortable signing it on behalf of LibDemVoice. Though the site’s neutral we’ve never pretended that those of us who contribute to it are: the point is we represent a diverse range of views within the party, and offer a platform to anyone within (and sometimes beyond) the party to put across their own views. It would be a bit weird if the only people prevented from putting their own views across were those of us who put in the time to running the site!
@ Alistair – as I’ve always said, the one good proposal within Leveson was access to low-cost arbitration that avoided the ruinous expense of litigation. But as I’ve also said above, there is still too little clarity about the proposed system for us to know quite what risk we’d be taking on by signing up to the proposed regulatory system.
“You will be well aware that most of those who are trying to scupper the proposed press regulation are not doing so because they have concerns about the fine details”
So where does that leave people who do have concerns about the fine details? That is where the devil is usually to be found. This is legislation drafted in haste and passed into law without much scrutiny (3 hours plus whatever the Lords give it on reconsideration – when they also have some signficant bits of the substantive Crime & Courts legislation to deal with). That is a crazy way to make legislation as significant and potentially far reaching as this.
The Labour govenment was massively criticised for introducing huge numbers of provisions at report stage when they couldn’t be properly scrutinised in the Criminal Justice Act – that’s just what’s happening here.
Stephen – the Royal Charter says “The membership of a regulatory body should be open to all publishers on fair,
reasonable and non-discriminatory terms, including making membership potentially available on different terms for different types of publisher.” so there is plenty of scope for dealing with small publishers. But I agree that how this will operate in practice isn’t clear – which comes back the the broken record I keep playing about the lack of scrutiny for this legislation..
But if you’re backing amendments that would change the definition of a “relevant publisher” so as to take small and non-profit blogs out of the system altogether – benefits and all – then you certainly do want to deny me choice, in spite of what you say.
Which is it?
@Hywel,
You’re right about what the Royal Charter says. But signing up will be of no benefit to bloggers (or at least, won’t give us the same benefits as it gives the press) if we’re excluded from the legislation. That’s the devilish detail I’m arguing with Stephen about.
I don’t have a problem with this post on LDV. I supported the regulation of the press, but I have a full time job and I do not have enough time to look at the details. It does alarm me reading this article the breadth of opposition to the parts of the agreement that relate to blogging and I hope it is not too late to make changes to what was agreed.
I would call it normal, not a bit weird at all. You either take responsibility or you don’t, there’s no half way.
“But if you’re backing amendments that would change the definition of a “relevant publisher” so as to take small and non-profit blogs out of the system altogether – benefits and all – then you certainly do want to deny me choice, in spite of what you say.”
As a blogger you’re eligible to be regulated, according to the royal charter. The Crime and Courts Bill governs only the “sticks” of exemplary damages and costs, and its definition of “relevant publisher” is already much more restricted than that in the royal charter. If you’re an individual blogger it already excludes you.
“Trans woman commits suicide after being bullied by the Daily Mail””
A tragic occurrence. But repeatedly posting links to this story isn’t really a substitute for reasoned discussion about press regulation, is it? Shouldn’t a liberal favour a more considered approach to such an important issue, rather than indulging in a kind of emotional blackmail?
@Hywel:
“This is legislation drafted in haste and passed into law without much scrutiny”
Perhaps it should be renamed the ‘Dangerous Press-dogs Act’?
@ Carl Gardner – .”
I fully support independent self-regulation and the right of those who want to opt-in being able to do so.
My personal view is this shouldn’t be (probably can’t be) legally enshrined without impinging on free speech.
With my LDV hat on, though, it will depend on more practical considerations, such as cost and the actual make-up of the regulator itself.
There’s also a Catch-22 for me: I don’t really want to be any part of a club that includes the Daily Mail/Express/Sun: if it does the code is clearly too diluted; and if it doesn’t then the regulator is clearly unworkable.
Haven’t you already joined that club, Stephen? All of you post online articles whose taste and appropriateness can be subject to debate.
That list of co-signatories is a very good reason not to support anything they advocate. Stephen is the only sensible person out of that whole bunch and on this occasion (unusually) I think he is profoundly mistaken.
Anything that unites the right wing press is not likely to be good for the rest of society !
“That list of co-signatories is a very good reason not to support anything they advocate.”
As a general principle, wouldn’t it be a good idea to look at the arguments on their merits, rather than taking a look at the proponents’ names and deciding on that basis to oppose whatever it is they may be saying?
“As a general principle, wouldn’t it be a good idea to look at the arguments on their merits, rather than taking a look at the proponents’ names and deciding on that basis to oppose whatever it is they may be saying?”
Yes, done that too. But if Enoch Powell, Gerry Adams, Ian Paisley and Tony Benn were signed up to something, and wrote to a national newspaper publicising their mutual alignment in an effort to influence others, then my view would typically be influenced … and not in a positive way. Stephen aside, this is the modern day equivalent of the “No” campaign front bench in the 1975 EEC referendum, and as such are a highly (negatively) persuasive bunch!
Dominic
I think your comparison is ridiculous, but – even on those terms – if Enoch Powell, Gerry Adams, Ian Paisley and Tony Benn had agreed about something, I should be sufficiently impressed by that fact to consider it quite carefully on its merits rather than dismissing it unconsidered.
You mean like they all agreed that we should withdraw from the (then) EEC? Yes, very impressive :roll eyes:
The 4 I mentioned were certainly more heavyweight than Stephen’s co-signatories but a similar level of flapping of white coats
Dominic
How you arrive at your political opinions is your business, of course, but I don’t think you should ridicule others for considering issues on their merits. I find it rarely does any harm.Graff G-5257-LC3-ACU Antique Copper Canterbury Bar Faucet with Porcelain Lever Handle and Sidespray

Edinson Cavani's brace fired Napoli into the semi-finals of the Coppa Italia on Wednesday at the expense of reigning champions Inter Milan.
Cavani's second-half strikes secured a 2-0 win at the San Paolo stadium that sees Napoli safely through to a last-four encounter with Siena, who defeated Chievo 1-0 in today's other quarter-final tie.
Walter Mazzarri's side had won just two of their last six Serie A games coming into tonight's match and were facing an Inter side riding a seven-match winning streak in the league, but Napoli turned the form book on its head with an assured display.
Cavani opened the scoring after 50 minutes, stroking home from the penalty spot after being fouled in the box by Thiago Motta, who was named in the side despite being strongly linked with a move to Paris St Germain.
The Uruguay star added his second in stoppage time as Napoli denied Inter a place in the semi-finals for the first time in nine years.
Siena booked their berth in the semis for the first time after their narrow win at Chievo.
Mattia Destro scored the game's only goal after 54 minutes, and Siena held on for the victory despite having to play the final half-hour with 10 men following the dismissal of Paolo Grossi.
The quarter-final matches conclude tomorrow with Lazio's trip to AC Milan. The winners of that tie will face Juventus.Ingredients

vs.3.2Columbia, MD – March 23, 2007: CELSION CORPORATION (AMEX: CLN) today announced it has filed for a Special Protocol Assessment (SPA) with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the design of its phase III trial of ThermoDox™ (Thermally Sensitive Liposomal Doxorubicin) in combination with radiofrequency ablation (RFA) to treat patients with non-resectable Hepatocellular Carcinoma (HCC). The Phase III trial, a randomized, double-blinded study, will examine the efficacy and safety of ThermoDox plus RFA versus RFA-alone. As proposed, the global trial is expected to enroll and randomize approximately 600 patients.
Dr. William Hahne, Celsion's Vice President of Research and Development, commented, "This filing is the culmination of over a year's dialogue with the FDA regarding endpoints and clinical study design for HCC, Celsion's lead indication. We believe we have addressed all of the Agency's suggestions on trial design and endpoints, and expect to receive a response back in late spring or early summer."
Michael Tardugno, Celsion's President and Chief Executive Officer, added, "Submission of our protocol is an important milestone for Celsion as it clearly demonstrates our commitment to ThermoDox as a treatment for primary liver cancer. Clearance through the SPA process will provide a clear pathway to approval. By commercializing ThermoDox, Celsion will address the unmet medical needs of HCC patients, who have very few treatment options. Our objective is to improve the efficacy of RFA, the standard of care therapy, and to provide another treatment option for this indication. We expect this SPA process enables the fastest path to market. We will disclose more details on our Phase III program as we near enrollment."
About Special Protocol Assessment: A Special Protocol Assessment (SPA) from the FDA is an agreement that the Phase III trial protocol design, clinical endpoints, and statistical analyses are acceptable to support regulatory approval. An SPA is binding upon the FDA unless a substantial scientific issue essential to determining safety or efficacy is identified after the testing is begun. For more information please visit the FDA website:.
About Hepatocellular Carcinoma: Hepatocellular Carcinoma (HCC) is the most common form of primary liver cancer, and one of the most deadliest forms of cancer. It is estimated that up to 90% of liver cancer patients will die within five years of diagnosis. The incidence of primary liver cancer (approximately 19,000 new cases per year in the US) is relatively low compared to other cancers in the US, but is the #4 cancer worldwide estimated at over 500,000, with particularly high incidence in Asia. The most common underlying etiologies of HCC are Hepatitis B, C, and Cirrhosis, which are also on the rise in the West.
Although the most successful treatments for primary liver cancer are either surgical resection or liver transplantation, unfortunately over 80% of these HCC patients are non-resectable and only candidates for minimally invasive procedures such as radiofrequency ablation (RFA). Early stage liver cancer generally has few symptoms and delay detection and diagnosis, and when finally detected the tumor frequently is too large for surgery. There are few alternative treatments, since radiation therapy and chemotherapy have been largely ineffective...
Celsion has also developed a microwave based system, the Prolieve Thermodilatation® system, for the treatment of benign prostatic hyperplasia which is marketed in the United States under an exclusive distribution agreement with Boston Scientific Corporation.Jazz Ousts Nuggets, Avoids Making History
Article excerpt
The Utah Jazz, desperate to avoid one of the most embarrassing defeats in National Basketball Association history, finally ended the Denver Nuggets' memorable playoff run Saturday.
Karl Malone scored 31 points as Utah halted its playoff skid against the upstart Nuggets with a 91-81 victory in Game 7 of their Western Conference semifinal series.
"Everybody loves Cinderella, everybody loves the underdog. So it was neat to get the job done," Malone said.
As the 17th successive home team to win a Game 7, Utah avoided the embarrassment of becoming the first team to lose a playoff series after leading 3-0.
Malone hit 12 of 23 shots and also pulled down 14 rebounds as the Jazz earned only its second trip to the conference finals. In 1992, Utah lost in six games to Portland.
But Malone said it was too early to rejoice.
"Houston will be tough," he said. "Until we touch untouched waters, I have nothing to celebrate. We've been to the Western Conference finals before."
Jeff Hornacek scored 18 points for the Jazz, which will face the Houston Rockets in a series that starts Monday in Houston. …Joined: 03 July 2005

Between the flashes of lightning and roars of the thunder, the rhythmic "plit plat, plit plat" sound of the falling raindrops entices you to the window.

Ashiya's family hasn't arrived on her birthday. She looked at the rains, dark clouds tried to locate a year back on this same day.
It had rained heavily, Tree branch was about to fall someone pulled her. Frightened held on to the shirt of the man, found herself in the arms of Meer. She was soaked in water so was he; they sensed body's warm touch that was so comforting. In birthday party, co-incidentally Meer came with a friend. They chatted felt some attraction towards each other. Days followed they would keep meeting. Meer proposed,
"Rains poured from where God stays,He brought u to me in some ways,
I love U, do U?"
Ashiya replied,
"U r someone who made me feel special, Ur love in my life is most essential.I love u."
Meer worked in Bangalore, Ashiya in Pune. She reached Bangalore; he was hassled by her presence not glad. She went feeling he doesn't love her. She switched off her mobile. When switched on Meer called up, "How careless she is!". Ashiya argued, "Does her presence really matter?" They echoed they r getting only pain and called off their relationship.
Back to present, Ashiya cried, "I CANT… I WANT...". The doorbell rang she opened saw Meer. He said, "I CANT… I WANT...I mean…" Ashiya hugged him. Meer gave anklets took her in his arms danced engrossed in love. Family had to break the door to join. They felt rains poured wishes coming true in their lives.

I had travelled through Lancaster as a child to visit relatives further north, and my only memory was a Pennsylvania Dutch restaurant with a windmill, where I fell in love with shoefly pie. Last summer was my first visit since about 1965, and my wife and I eagerly sought out the windmill. To my delight, it was still there, and so was the shoefly pie. The name of the restaurant, which I had long forgotten, was Dutch Haven, which they now bill as “the place that made shoefly pie famous”. Dating from the 1920’s, it ceased being a restaurant in the 1990’s, and now is a bakery and craft store, where among other things you can buy an “I love Intercourse” cap, referring of course to the town of Intercourse, Pennsylvania, just a few miles north. If you were ever an adolescent boy, you no doubt have heard of the town of Intercourse, but my wife and I actually had a chance to drive through it for the first time in our lives a couple of days later. Very picturesque countryside.
Right next door to the Dutch Haven is Jakey’s Amish Barbeque, which like the shoefly pie was exceedingly delicious. When I asked the server if the recipe was really Amish, he said not really, it was from North Carolina. Like many things in Lancaster, it’s called Amish to attract the tourists. Nothing wrong with that if it tastes good, I said.
The old Lincoln Highway, which once ran from the East Coast to the West Coast, runs through the city of Lancaster and several miles east of the city through some of the most beautiful farmland in the world. Like any highway through a suburb of a major city, it is an endless procession of traffic and shopping malls, but in a way I have never witnessed before in my life. Behind every mall, is an endless array of farmland, and not just one farm, but a farm beyond it, and another farm beyond that. It’s as if the malls are creating a wall between the commercial culture of urban Lancaster and the pristine farmland beyond.
My wife wanted to “eat Pennsylvania Dutch food and gain five pounds”, so we asked the motel clerk for a recommendation. The buffet was good but overpriced (about twenty-five dollars for all you can eat), so we opted for the soup and salad bar and some delicious microbrews. Next day to avoid the tourist traps, we asked the woman at the Mennonite Historical Society which we visited for our research where we could find good Pennsylvania Dutch food. She told us that a few miles east on the Lincoln Highway (Route 30) was a buffet restaurant called Diener’s, run by Amish and Mennonites. If you go be forewarned, the place is run by farmers who go to bed early, and in spite of serving dinner, closes at 6PM. Luckily, we arrived early, and had one of the best meals of our lives. Simple, farm fresh food, spread out on at least twenty tables, all you can eat for $9.99.
The next morning we woke early. My wife, brandishing a guidebook, had mapped a drive through the beautiful farmland of Amish country, north of the shopping malls on Route 30. She had also found yet another Amish/Mennonite buffet called Yoder’s which got a rave review in her guidebook, and was conveniently located along our northern route.
As often as I have seen the pictures, I was still amazed to see how the Amish navigate their horses and buggies through highway traffic, which often is not proceeding slowly. You get a reassuring sense that this is their world, and you must adjust to their way of life if you wish to be a part of it.
The farms behind farms behind farms I previously mentioned unfolded before us in a vast panorama. I tend to be a fast driver, but I found myself driving considerably below the speed limit just to take it all in, and frequently feeling the need to speed up when cars lined up behind me. The towns have such charming names: in addition to Intercourse, there is Paradise, Eden, Bird in Hand, Fertility, Blue Ball, and Zooks Corner.
Along the way came Yoder’s, which we expected to be like Diener’s the day before. But in this case Yoder’s was an Amish/Mennonite shopping mall, tastefully designed in neo-Colonial style, complete with a Christian book store, and (like Diener’s) Biblical quotations posted on the walls, comforting since all were of the “Love thy neighbor” and “God loves you” variety instead of “God hates liberals.” (Believe me, I once saw billboards like the latter in North Carolina).
If Diener’s had twenty food tables, Yoder’s must have had thirty, and the lunch buffet was $9.99. (A few dollars more for the dinner buffet.) Every bit as delicious as our meal the day before. I told my wife I was eating cream corn, and she corrected me that the corn had been cooked in its own sweet juice that I mistook for cream. I find it difficult to tell the difference between the Mennonites and the Amish, but it seemed that most of the Pennsylvania Dutch we saw were Old Order Mennonites. Many of them spoke German, which I later learned was a Pennsylvania Dutch German dialect. Because the restaurant was quite crowded, we ended up in the banquet room across from a table of about a dozen or so Mennonite teenage boys and girls in traditional dress. At one point, I noticed they were sitting silently with their heads bowed, obviously in prayer.
My genealogy research has revealed that, unknown to me until recently, I had Mennonite ancestors who came to Lancaster County from Switzerland via Germany in 1717 to escape religious persecution. They maintained their religion through my maternal great great grandfather, who died in 1875, and my great grandmother finally married outside the faith (Although her uncle, my great great grandfather’s younger brother, became a Presbyterian earlier). My late mother and grandmother never spoke of our Mennonite ancestors, and I wonder if my mother even knew they existed. Seeing the pious young men and women praying, and hearing the adults speaking Pennsylvania Dutch German, I could not help but wonder if they were like my ancestors.
Before our visit to Lancaster, we had just come from a stay in Carlisle, Pennsylvania, about two thirds the size of Lancaster, with its own shopping mall strewn highway on its outskirts, and some very beautiful farmland as well (although the two are meticulously separated), but otherwise as different from Lancaster as day from night. Carlisle is a historic town, which studiously promotes its history through signposts and the like, and surprisingly cosmospolitan, perhaps due to the presence of Dickinson College and the U.S. Army War College. As a lover of international cuisine, I was delighted to find a Belgian restaurant (with over a hundred beers), a brew pub with Irish food, a Middle Eastern restaurant (which I haven’t tried yet) , and a Japanese noodle restaurant (with srihacha sauce readily available for my hot spice addiction). The people we met were uniformly charming and friendly. And yet a whiter community you would not find. My wife and I barely saw a single African-American or Asian during our entire stay, except briefly on the Dickinson College campus and the aforesaid noodle restaurant.
The city of Lancaster, on the other hand, in the heart of conservative Amish country, is as ethnically diverse as Baltimore, with African-American and Latino citizens very much in evidence, while on the other hand the area along the Lincoln Highway almost feels like a Pennsylvania Dutch theme park, full of little children and the elderly (since my wife and I have both turned sixty, I guess we qualify as the latter). Some Amish farmers even charge tourists a fee to allow them to help with the farm work, not to mention the buggy rides.
None of this seems to alter the intergrity of the Amish lifestyle. As my wife very astutely observed, when the Amish realized they were becoming a tourist attraction, they took control of the business. There is no big corporation in charge of Amish farm tours or buggy rides. This is a way for the Amish to share their lifestyle with the outside world while keeping it at arms length. Many of them have gotten rich in the process. I can think of no better example of the American promise of freedom of religion or the fulfillment of the American Dream.Amish, food, genealogy, Glenn Beck and the leadership of Fox News made a mockery of their commitment to me and two rabbis.

Recent studies of Roman gold-mining, in Britain at Dolaucothi, and in Spain at las Médulas, Montefurado and Puerto del Palo, have shown that many valuable results can be obtained at such sites by a careful programme of field-work. The present article is the result of field-work in the region of the Rio Duerna in 1970. It was also possible to undertake a special in-depth survey of one of the mines, the working known as los Castellones. This mine was chosen as one of the most important and interesting in the valley.
Previously attention has centred on the hard-rock mines of the south of Spain and Portugal, and there are few sources referring to the gold-mines of the north in any but very general terms. O. Davies has compiled a list of most of them and thus rendered a valuable service, in spite of some errors. Strangely he does not give the most comprehensive source as his reference for the mines of the Duerna area (which he calls ‘Quintanilla’ on his map IIIa), although he makes use of it elsewhere.Learn how easy it is to sync an existing GitHub or Google Code repo to a SourceForge project!

Roasting beets and fennel intensifies their flavor. Drizzled with a tarragon-infused vinaigrette, this is a perfect salad for fall entertaining.
2 medium beets
1 large fennel bulb
2 tablespoons olive oil
1 package (6 ounces) mixed salad greens
2 seedless oranges, peeled and thinly sliced
1/2 cup sliced red onion
6 tablespoons olive oil
3 tablespoons white wine vinegar
2 teaspoons McCormick Gourmet™ Tarragon
1 teaspoon McCormick® Pure Vanilla Extract
1/2 teaspoon McCormick Gourmet™ Sicilian Sea Salt
1/2 teaspoon sugar
1/4 teaspoon McCormick Gourmet™ Black Pepper, Coarse Ground
Preheat oven to 425°F. Remove greens and bottom roots from beets. Wrap beets with foil. Roast 45 to 60 minutes or until beets are tender when pierced with small knife. Cool until able to handle. Peel beets and cut into slices.
Meanwhile, trim base from fennel bulb. Reserve fennel fronds for garnish. Cut fennel into wedges. Toss with 2 tablespoons of the oil. Arrange fennel in single layer on foil-lined shallow baking pan sprayed with no stick cooking spray. Roast fennel 25 to 30 minutes, turning halfway through cook time. Cool.
Mix remaining 6 tablespoons oil, vinegar, tarragon, vanilla, sea salt, sugar and pepper in small bowl with wire whisk until well blended. Divide greens, oranges, beets, fennel and red onion among 6 salad plates. Serve with dressing. Garnish with fennel fronds, if desired.
(Amount per serving)It was always this time of year, when fresh green peppers were being picked from a garden at a small farm near our home in a suburb of St. Paul, that my mom would make Hungarian stuffed peppers. They were a family favorite. I still look forward to the first big pot of stuffed peppers I make each summer. They are packed tight with uncooked rice, ground beef and ground pork and paprika and simmer in a large pot of tomato juice. And served with a very generous mound of mashed potatoes. I posted that recipe a couple of years ago. You can get right to that recipe by clicking here.
The stuffed peppers I made this week were far from those Hungarian-style peppers. I used leftover Rice and Orzo Summer Pilaf (recipe in my column this week), filled with fresh, local vegetables to stuff the first peppers of the season that I bought at my localÂ farmers market. I mixed some chopped tomato and some rinsed and drained chickpeas to make the peppers a meal.
The photo above shows the stuffed peppers ready to hit the oven. Some folks may like to blanch the pepper halves before stuffing so that they become very soft during the baking time. I prefer more texture. When the peppers are baked without being blanched they are crisp-tender.
I had a chunk of tomato basil goat cheese in the refrigerator that I was trying for the first time, a purchase from a new farmer at the market this year. Her family raises the goats on their farm near Motley and Eichten’s in Center City, famous for their gouda cheese, make the cheese for them using the milk from their goats. The farmer said she uses the goat cheese on grilled sandwiches, so I knew it must be a good melting cheese. I grated some up and sprinkled it over the peppers during the last minutes of baking.
These peppers make a satisfying meal. And, when you’re using leftover Rice and Orzo Summer Pilaf, the meal takes only minutes to make. They’re not my mom’s Hungarian stuffed peppers, yet they are surprisingly delicious.
Rice and Orzo Summer Pilaf Stuffed Peppers
I had about 2 cups of leftover Pilaf. It was enough to stuff 4 pepper halves.
- 2 cups Rice and Orzo Summer Pilaf
- 1 large fresh tomato, chopped
- Chickpeas, rinsed and drained, as many as you desire to add to the stuffing
- 2 medium green peppers, cut in half lengthwise, seeds removed
- 1/4 cup grated cheese of your choice
- 1/4 to 1/2 cup vegetable broth or beef broth
Preheat oven to 375 degrees.
Mix Pilaf, tomato and chickpeas together in a bowl. Generously stuff each of the four pepper halves with the mixture. Arrange in a baking dish. Pour just enough broth into the baking dish to cover the bottom, about 1/4 inch deep. Cover the dish with aluminum foil and seal tightly. Bake in preheated oven for 30 minutes. Remove foil from baking dish. Sprinkle cheese on each stuffed pepper. Return to oven and bake, uncovered, about 10 minutes or until cheese is melted and slightly browned. Serve immediately.Every now and then you are surprised by how deftly a film can balance between two different themes or elements. The fact that For A Good Time, Call… can be both sweet and raunchy at the same time is a testament to co-writers Lauren Anne Miller and Katie Anne Naylon along with feature debut director Jamie Travis.
But the film really succeeds by presenting two women in Lauren and Ari Graynor that, despite their bickering, you end up rooting on to become friends (that’s the sweet part). The raunchy part is filled in by the backdrop of them running a phone sex line out of their apartment in New York as Lauren breaks out of her shell. A few weeks ago I was able to sit down with Miller and Graynor to talk about finding that balance, the soundboard featured in the film, catching audiences off guard, a bejeweled dildo named Susan, and much more. Below you will find my full video interview and past that a transcription.
The Film Stage: Did you create the soundboard in the film? Who has it now?
Lauren Anne Miller: Who…
Ari Graynor: I thought you had it.
Miller: No, I don’t have it.
Graynor: Or Sue has it.
Miller: No, actually, no one has it. We lost it somewhere in the mix.
Oh, no!
Miller: We tried to get it. But we have a new one.
Graynor: Oh.
Miller: But yea, that was one of those things that was in the script. Like, in the original. We put it in there and kind of forgot about it. You go to shoot it and someone hands you a little keyboard from 1983 and you record stuff. I don’t think it actually worked to record, if I remember, on set. But the stuff that…
Graynor: Yea, you did!
Technical difficulties?
Graynor: You did record it.
Miller: And it played it back?
Graynor: Yea, and it played it back. We did go to the ADR booth… we’re making a digital version of that which will be on our website in a week or so. But we had to go to the studio… by the way, my mom was there that day and we had to record all those things for every key.
Miller: We had to record 40 different things so when you go online you can string together your own funny little sentence.
Graynor: But the most fun thing is that our two pink phones exist and Lauren has one and Katie has one.
Miller: Yea, we have the phones.
How did you come up with the character names? What’s that story?
Miller: We’re just really uncreative.
[Laughs]
Graynor: Is there a story!? Well, my God, of course there is.
Miller: We just… I don’t know. It was one of those things. My husband, Seth Rogen, and his writing partner, Evan Goldberg, they wrote Superbad with their names. It was just literally, ‘Let’s do the same thing. It’ll be funny.’ I don’t think we really intended to keep it but because the character were based on ourselves. Katie and I met in college. We were a random roommate match and we are very different people just like the Katie and Lauren in the movie. I’m certainly more of the rule follower and Katie’s more of the rule breaker, if you will. And Katie ran a phone sex line out of college. Out of her dorm room. 1-800-FSU-TITS. So it was based on true events. I should say ‘Inspired by’. This is not a documentary of our story.
Graynor: It’s a biopic.
[Laughs] In the film you have green tea to help your throat. Did it ever get to that point on set?
Graynor: I think we were just tired. I think there were days where we were, as you do in independent film making, it’s quite a sprint. You shoot for 14-15 hours a day and we would be back on set 10 hours later. So we were tired, as one is when you shoot, but the phone sex… there’s not that much in it. It’s set in the world of phone sex. It exists. But it’s not like we were screaming on a daily basis. We had our moments.
What part of the process did you find the balance between sweet and raunchy? Was it in the script or was it found in the editing room?
Miller: Certainly a combo of the two, but that was the intention. To tell this sort of sweet friendship story but through something that could make these characters uncomfortable so that they could discover what they are really meant to be and to live up to their potential. I think you have to put your characters in hot water sometimes so, especially for Lauren’s character, to be tossed into this world. She’s having this really boring, normal sex. To be tossed into this world where she’s forced to be a little bit more outrageous is a really good test to put her through. And at the same time…
Graynor: For Katie to be able to hide behind the phone and to be able to present a certain kind of confidence. A certain kind of bravado. And really to have that be a total front for who she actually is, it’s kind of a genius setup. But when I first read the script the sweetness was just pouring out of it. And that’s what I thought made it so special.
Miller: Just comes so naturally… that sweetness.
[Laughs]
Graynor: Friendly sweetness.
As we recently saw with Ruby Sparks, what do you think of this growing trend of women writing their own roles?
Miller: I think it’s great. I think making a movie as an actor; as a writer; as anything… is difficult. I think a lot of people have dreams and desires to do something and it’s about recognizing that maybe if someone else isn’t going to give you that opportunity, maybe you need to make it happen for yourself. And there’s a lot of amazingly talented people out there waiting for the chance to do something. We got tired of waiting. We just decided to make it happen for ourselves and I think it’s so awesome that so many people are doing that. It’s so inspiring.
What do you think of the press tours and Q&As?
Graynor: The Q&A, it’s always so exciting and nerve-wracking to hear what people thought. We only went to Sundance and we had an incredible, surprising response there.
Miller: It was amazing.
Graynor: It was unbelievable. I always joke that I have what I call ‘Birthday Party Syndrome.’ And I get it before every screening. And I was just talking about it with our premiere. I’m always afraid that no one will be there. No one will like it.
[Laughs]
Graynor: When we sneak in at the end of the screenings and we hear laughter. Each time it’s happened in every city and we just look at each other, ‘Oh my God, it’s happening!’ It’s all of those things at once because this is our baby and of course we want people to love it. And we’ve been so lucky so far that the response, knock on wood, has been pretty wonderful.
This looks like a studio movie. It even starts like a studio film a bit with an easy going start. Do you think you’ll catch some audiences off guard?
Miller: Who knows. We were very lucky that we had an extraordinary director of photography and he was able to make our movie look so incredible in a short period of time. As far as our story goes that was just the natural way to start our story off. You have to show your characters living in a very real, normal way. And then the color starts coming in and you really start to get into your journey. I hope that people are excited that we made this movie really quickly and in a short period of time. But I hope that it can stand on its own in the world of comedy.
Graynor: And in terms of selling the movie by starting off sort of clean in the beginning and it gets crazier: the two realities of our movie is that there is phone sex and at the same time it’s very sweet and innocent in a lot of ways. Certainly that’s tricky to present both sides of that in trailers, TV spots, or interviews, but we’re doing our best to let people know about both sides so that no one finds themselves… pleasantly surprised at the movie but not surprised that both of those facets exist.
What were your favorite props?
Graynor: Earl. Kevin.
Miller: Earl and Kevin were…
Are those…
Graynor: Earl and Kevin are two of our favorite dildos.
Miller: And the bejeweled dildo…
Graynor: What was her name? Susan? Sherry?
Miller: Susan.
Graynor: Susan.
Miller: But I would say for me, that even moreso than the keyboard, was the thong banner that Ari’s hanging. That, literally, was one of those things we wrote and I truly forgot about it. I showed up on set that day and sure enough there was someone sewing underwear together. I literally wanted to be like, ‘I am so sorry about this crazy idea we had.’ And there they are. I’m so proud of that thong banner. I think that was the first thong banner ever.
Graynor: Really?
Miller: It may be.
Graynor: Maybe.
Miller: I don’t know.

A dip in existing home sales and a weaker-than-expected reading on new unemployment claims proved to be an anchor on the stock market Thursday, erasing a morning rally bid.
The day began with mostly good news. Spain’s government was able to sell more bonds than anticipated, albeit at higher yields than last time around, and earnings from Bank of America and Morgan Stanley came out better than expected as did results from Verizon Communications and DuPont.
Enthusiasm over earnings and the brief respite from Europe’s debt woes were short-lived though, as the weekly reading on new U.S. jobless claims came in above expectations at 386,000, then about 30 minutes into the trading session existing home sales showed a decline in March to just under 4.5 million, below the expected figure of slightly more than 4.6 million. Another data point out Thursday, the Philadelphia Fed’s monthly manufacturing gauge, also disappointed by coming in at its lowest reading since January and below the consensus forecast at 8.5.
Morning gains fizzled and in afternoon trading the Dow was off 68 points at 12,964, hte S&P 500 7 points 1,378 and the Nasdaq 15 points to 3,017.
Financial stocks seemed to be a bright spot early after BofA and Morgan Stanley topped estimates, but while the latter held up with a 1.4% gain the former slipped into the red, losing 1.4%. (See “Say Goodbye To Blockbuster Bank Earnings.”)
Travelers, the insurance giant, was a big early winner and extended its rally to 4.9% gain after trouncing estimates by a big margin. Fellow Dow component Verizon gained 1.5% after narrowly edging the consensus view, while DuPont slipped 1.8% despite a sales gain that pushed results past the Street’s expectations.

Thursday, April 12, 2012
Much of the locally based pollution sources are old landfills, textile mills, industrial buildings, and other hazardous waste sites that were contaminated before modern environmental laws took effect, according to Eugenia Marks, Senior Director for Policy at the Audubon Society of Rhode Island. (See below for the complete breakdown.)
The turning point for environmental regulation was four decades ago—in the early 1970s, when the landmark Clean Water Act and Clean Air Act were passed, along with a slew of other environmental reforms. Rhode Island, along with the rest of the country, has come a long way since then, but it is still paying the price for the sins of the past, Marks said.
GoLocalProv examined five local sources of potential toxic pollution: hazardous waste sites, active and closed landfills; leaking underground storage tanks; businesses like incinerators and chemical manufacturing plants that produce toxic chemicals; and businesses that have a permit to release bacteria and toxic chemicals into waterways within certain limits. Data for each was culled from various databases maintained by the state DEM, the EPA, and other sources. (See below for more information.)
The Communities at the Top
The communities with the highest concentration of toxic pollution sources are also the most urbanized areas of the state. Central Falls found itself at the top of the list, followed by Providence, Pawtucket, and Woonsocket. But there are notable exception of rural communities that neared the top of the list, including Warren and Middletown.
It’s no coincidence, she said, that higher rates of diseases like diabetes and asthma are also concentrated in the same places.
“We know that health and environment go hand in hand,” Rose said. “That’s why it’s so important that protections be put in place so that every community can enjoy a healthy environment.”
But toxic sites aren’t concentrated in the cities only. Rose, a former state organizer for the Toxics Action Center, said toxic sites line some of the state’s water bodies, reflecting a historic use of water by textile mills. The mills may no longer be running, but businesses like wastewater treatment plants and boat yards to be closer to the water. And in Providence, the scrap metal businesses along Allens Avenue are one of the major potential sources of pollution in the city, according to environmental advocates.
Pollution Sites: What is the risk?
The toxic sites listed below pose varying risks to public health and the environment.
“We have a lot of risks in life and this is one of them,” Rose said. “It is something to be concerned about.”
But even if an accident occurs or a rule occurs at one of the toxic sites, the level of risk to the public can only be assessed by determining on a case by case basis how people would become exposed to the toxic chemicals, according to John Torgan, director of ocean and coastal conservation at the state chapter of the Nature Conservancy. “Just the presence of toxic substances doesn’t mean there’s a public health risk,” Torgan said.
Toxic Tanks to Lethal Landfills
Sources of toxic chemicals range from leaking underground storage tanks hidden from view to that eyesore of an old landfill. Below are the five categories of toxic sites reviewed in the GoLocalProv toxic towns ranking:
■ Businesses that produce or release toxic chemicals: These are businesses that are in the national Toxics Release Inventory, also maintained by the EPA. The database tracks businesses—which are required to report such things—that use, manufacture, treat, transport, or release 650 various toxic chemicals. The category is far broader than the water dischargers and includes potential pollution from air emissions, releases into the ground, and underground injections as well as surface water discharges. The inventory can be accessed online here.
■ Superfund sites: Since the 1970s, the word “Superfund” has become virtually synonymous with hazardous waste sites, although the term technically refers to sites that have been identified as serious enough to warrant the EPA getting involved to clean them up and find those responsible for the contamination. There are degrees of seriousness—the most toxic Superfund sites are on the National Priorities List. As of 2008, there were a dozen NPL Superfund sites in Rhode Island—within three miles of more than 115,000 residents, according to the Toxics Action Center. But the total number of all Superfund sites is currently just shy of 150. Click here to view the EPA database.
■ Leaking underground storage tanks: Known as LUSTs, these hidden dangers are most commonly associated with gas stations. It wasn’t until the 1980s that the country woke up the hazards of broken and poorly insulated tanks contaminating the surround environment. According to the last count by DEM, there were approximately 1,700 LUSTs in Rhode Island as of 2006. The state has a fund to help businesses repair or upgrade their tanks, but the review commission that reviews businesses applications has a $1 million backlog, according to Paul Beaudette, one of the members. The threat of contamination from an underground storage tank is very much a real one: in the early 2000s, a leaky tank at a gas station in Burrillville released toxic BTEs in the aquifer which served as the drinking water for residents. (BTE stands for benzene, toluene, and ethylbenzene compounds.)

A global, shared responsibility calls for an increased number of Member States to contribute with higher amounts to UNEP, in particular to the Environment Fund. Governments are the core of UNEP’s funding because UNEP is an intergovernmental organization owned by the 193 UN Member States. The Member States must collectively change the current reality right now: UNEP is dependent on 15 countries for 93 per cent of the funding to the Environment Fund (2013). Each and every country is a donor, each and every country is a recipient. Resourcing the 2014-2015 budget will require a broadening and deepening of the current donor base.
Fortunately, support for UNEP is widespread. Altogether 181 countries made at least one voluntary contribution to the Environment Fund in the period 1973-2011. Some 12 countries maintained regular annual contributions over the same period.
Moreover, when it comes to the environment, the challenges do not stop at borders. Therefore, every Member State has a role both as a donor and as a recipient.
Contributions to the Environment Fund 2013
Subsequent to the governments’ commitment in Rio to providing Stable, Secure, Adequate, Increased Financial Resources for UNEP (paragraph 88b) through both regular budget and voluntary contributions, several governments recognized that some collective momentum was needed to achieve this commitment. Discussions were hence initiated amongst some Member States with the main purpose of finding a way to share the funding burden and generating additional contributions, in particular, to the Environment Fund (EF). So far the discussions have identified key areas that led to the development of a global funding strategy and identified a need for more in-depth analysis on the quality of funding and what can be jointly done to reach out to as wide a range of funding partners as possible. Country-by-country strategies are also being developed for the Member States and the secretariat jointly.

The stirring of a body of viscous fluid using multiplestirring rods is known to be particularly effective whenthe rods trace out a path corresponding to a nontrivialmathematical braid. The optimal braid is the so-called"pigtail braid", in which three stirring rods executethe usual "over-under" motion associated with braiding plaiting) hair. We show how to achieve this optimalbraiding motion straightforwardly: one stirring rod isdriven in a figure-of-eight motion, while the other tworods are baffles, which rotate episodically about theircommon centre. We also explore the extent to which the physical baffles may be replaced by flow structures(such as periodic islands). a jetted tub.

Hans Fugal kindly tried to help me on this list on 6 Dec 2005, and sent me this informative link: However, that didn't fix it for me.

This past Friday, the USC women's volleyball team paid an after-school visit to Pio Pico Middle School in order to launch their partnership through the SCORE Initiative.
The program unites local middle and elementary schools with student-athletes in order to educate through the "Four Quarters" of SCORE: Physical Health, Academic Integrity, Team Building, and Community Responsibility. The SCORE Initiative includes monthly contact between the team and school, as well as the opportunity for the young students to attend a sporting event on USC's campus.
The pairing between Pio Pico and women's volleyball seemed perfect even from the start. The Pio Pico Panthers volleyball team has consistently been one of the best in the Los Angeles Unified School District, and they couldn't wait to meet one of the best college teams in the nation.
First, the athletes gathered in the school's auditorium for an educational session. They spoke about the importance of each SCORE Quarter as it relates to being a Trojan student-athlete.
Afterwards, the athletes answered questions about balancing their busy schedules, handling teammates who might not be performing well, eating habits before games, and even participating in the crosstown rivalry with UCLA.
Next, the action moved to the gym for an impromptu session of volleyball games. The Trojans and Panthers teamed up for casual drills to share their love of the game.
At the end of the day, the kids received SCORE notebooks, pens, and autographed posters as reminders of the lessons taught by their new mentors.
The Trojans plan to host more opportunities at Pio Pico next year in an attempt to positively impact the student body. Additionally, the Panthers will visit Galen Center next Fall to cheer on their team in the 2014 season.

To avoid watered down iced coffee…freeze some extra coffee into cubes and add coffee cubes to your drink instead of regular
Cari S. On Monday, June 13 at 6:46 am
Oooh!. That’s a great idea, Sara.
Lisa On Monday, June 13 at 8:19 am
Ditto. Any leftover coffee gets frozen in ice cube trays and goes into a ziplock bag in the freezer. Any time we want iced coffee, those are the cubes we use.
crystal On Monday, June 13 at 12:53 pm
a bagel place in LA does the frozen coffee cubes. Its amazing! First time I’ve ever seen it done commercially.
Melissa On Monday, June 13 at 1:11 pm
That is brilliant and yet so common sense. Why didn’t I think of that?!
jennie On Monday, June 13 at 1:37 pm
*Like!* Our cafe downtown has served the frozen coffee cubes for years. I’m always a little disappointed when I buy an iced latte somewhere else and they give me regular ones! It really keeps the drink tasting strong, which is how I like it.

If you like frappuccinos, freeze some milk (I had some milk about to expire so I put a cup in a sandwich bag, froze flat on a cookie sheet, then put in a gallon freezer bag) thaw at 30% power for 30 seconds then put double strength coffee (add frozen cubes if you want it more frozen) in blender with milk. I like mocha so I add chocolate syrup and a couple pkgs of stevia. I know this is going to save me a lot of money since I now make frapps at home.

Sara: Thats the first thing I thought of! i read that in a magazine a couple years ago, but they used the coffee ice cubes for homemade blended coffee. It makes an amazing difference! Throw all these ingrediants above in the blender with coffee ice cubes, chocolate and/or caramel syrup, whip up some cream and voila! At home frappuchinos

If you have never heard of white coffee (sometimes called green coffee) then you probably have never been to Washington, Idaho or possibly northern Oregon and checked out one of their millions of coffee stands. Its WONDERFUL. It doesn’t have the bitter taste of black coffee but has twice the caff. Its made in shots for espresso. (can be done with a french press at home) I have made iced coffee by the pitcher using the sweet and condensed milk before and it is similar to a McDonalds iced coffee. Yum. In an effort to create a frape using white coffee I decided to make the ice cubes after making an every increasing batch when I was trying to get it to taste just right. My favorite syrups are salted caramel and Irish Cream. They are so smooth and way good. Anyway long ramble short, check out thomas hammer coffee online and look for white zombie coffee. Its worth the investment! Oh and Torani syrups have the best flavor in my opinion.
That’s just my 2 cents though.
Angela On Tuesday, August 30 at 11:09 pm
Thanks to Sara for the coffee ice cube idea. I tried it and it TOTALLY makes a big difference. I already freeze leftover coffee to use in my chocolate cake recipe so this is just another way to not waste a precious drop! Thanks.
CarolAnn On Friday, September 2 at 10:58 pm
I made a half batch of this brew last night and OH YUM! I don’t drink hot coffee, just foufy coffees with 1/2 & 1/2 and chocolate. I mixed this per Ree’s naughty naughty bad girl directions and 1 packet of raw stevia instead of sugar. I quit buying these drinks because they’re too costly. I just used cheap store brand coffee and it’s wonderful. Since I’m not a hot coffee lover it’s good enough for me cause I guess I don’t know the difference. Blissful ignorance is where I’m coming from here, and it’s working for me. Yee ha!! When I take my daughter out for her b-day girls day out tomorrow I’m meeting her at the door with an iced cuppa this brew. She’s gonna love it!!
I’m going to mix up a complete drink (brew, 1/2 & 1/2 and stevia) and freeze and bag it for future use. That way as it melts it’ll just blend right in. Oh yah!!

Barbara On Friday, June 17 at 6:40 pm
Don’t despair fellow “can’t drink coffee” people!!!! I make a similar drink with Caffix (a roasted grain beverage) that has almost the same taste without the shakes and tossing and turning at night! I just mix some “faux” coffee in some water, add stevia to taste, and some nonfat powdered milk in a tall glass and then fill with ice cubes. Sometimes I use a package of sugar (14 calories) or half and half (if I’m not watching my weight). When I am, I just use the powdered milk for that creamy taste even though it isn’t as rich… I keep some Caffix in my purse too for when I go to a restaurant. I put some in my water glass–since it usually tastes terrible–and add a pkg of sugar or stevia… If they said anything, I just tell them I can’t drink caffeinated drinks or soda pop, but they never do…
Wonderwiper On Monday, June 20 at 9:59 pm
@Amy…just use decaf. No shakes. The older I get the less I can drink regular coffee too. Try decaf, you don’t want to miss out on this bliss. : )
happy birds On Thursday, June 23 at 8:49 pm
this is 4 the gals who can not drink coffee due 2 its caffeinated property. I was wondering if any of you have tried Chicory? Like some above, I am not allowed to ingest any food or drink products containing caffeine. Chicory tastes like coffee but doesn’t have the side effects that coffee does. If u like the taste of coffee and not its side effects give chicory a try. Hope this may help or benefit someone.

Love, love, love the Toddy maker. I couldn’t live without mine! I suffer from acid reflux, and this has helped tremendously. I love that I have concentrate ready to go at any time….may just have to go make me a latte now
Benita On Monday, June 13 at 7:08 pm
I agree with everyone’s comets on the Toddy. It is a great product and really does cut down the acid released by brewing coffee hot. I got mine at a Borders Cafe years ago.
Robin On Tuesday, June 14 at 11:40 am
Another option to the Toddy, is to use a french press. Use 2/3 cup of strong flavored ground coffee and 3 cups of cold water. Put the press in just until liquid begins to show through the screen. Let sit on the counter for 12 to 24 hours.
When ready, press the grounds down and (Like Ree) pour liquid through a fine mesh sieve lined with a coffee filter. The ground stay in the press and the coffee filter strains out the finer sediment.
Refridgerate and use in a 50/50 mix with cold milk or cold water over a glass full of ice. Can also be used in a 50/50 mix with water and heated for a cup of hot coffee.
My family devours this in the summer so I make two presses at a time, every other day. It’s a much more manageable quantity.
Kelli On Wednesday, June 15 at 2:39 pm
@ Robin – That is such a BRILLIANT idea!!! I tried Ree’s idea, only I poured the grounds/water mixture into a filter in my regular old drip coffee maker. It worked, except for I kept having to dump grounds out and it was going SUUUPER slowly towards the end. Doing the brewing process in a french would take care of the majority of the grounds.
Katherine On Wednesday, June 15 at 4:02 pm
You HAVE to get a Toddy…. they will make this process 100 times easier. We have had ours for YEARS. My MIL has an old school one toddy must have first made. We are crazy addicted we go through 1 bag/batch a week.
The ice coffee i am making right now is coffee-mate french vanilla creamer and milk.
YOu can also do milk, brown sugar & chocolate syrup
Cher On Thursday, June 16 at 10:17 am
I have had my Toddy coffee maker for about 13 years. The flavor, smoothness, and convenience is fantastic. My friends and family always comment on how good my coffee is.
Judy G On Saturday, June 18 at 9:17 pm
41 years ago I got a Coffee Toddy maker as a wedding gift. Love it! It also works for hot coffee. Just add hot water.
Lori B On Tuesday, June 28 at 8:35 am
My husband owns a coffee shop and we too use and LOVE the toddy. SO smooth and delicious!
Melissa Moore On Tuesday, June 28 at 1:11 pm
Toddy is the BEST!! Simple process and amazing coffee! LOVE!
Liz T On Monday, July 11 at 9:53 pm
We love the Toddy Coffee System at our house, too! We have had the same one for about 12 years…definitely a good investment!
Linda D On Monday, August 1 at 11:53 pm
I LOVE my Toddy coffee maker too! I store my coffee syrup in an empty 5# honey bottle. It is great for taking camping. It is delicious with a layer of chocolate syrup in the bottom of the glass, then add 3 or 4 times that amount in coffee syrup and then add milk until it is a golden brown.
Robyn :) On Wednesday, September 7 at 11:56 pm
LOVE Toddy!! I usually use a Dark Roast from Trader Joes… what do you brew in yours? Anyone try the beans/grind from the Toddy website?

Beth On Monday, June 13 at 6:29 am
Yum, looks delicious! We use the Filtron cold brew system to make our coffee, and love it! (). Same principle as the container/cheesecloth process, just different parts. Looking forward to trying some iced coffee this summer.
Mary S On Tuesday, June 14 at 12:46 pm
We too have the Filtron system and LOVE it! We store the cold filtered coffee in the fridge and use it cold, microwaved for the singel hot cup as needed, over ice cream and in recipes…yum yum yum!

Maggie On Monday, June 13 at 6:32 am
I’m a former barista, and I miss having access to cold brewed iced coffee in large quantities!
A note about the taste – because you’re not adding hot water the coffee doesn’t develop the same bitter notes that hot coffee (or hot coffee allowed to cool to be served as iced coffee – blech!) can have. So it should have some natural sweetness and the flavors of the coffee can really shine through. It’s so worth it to try this with some good, single-origin fancy-pants coffee if you can get your hands on it. This also means it won’t take as much sugar/syrup to achieve the level of sweetness you like.
I encourage everyone to make cold brew at home, it’ll change your life!
Angie P On Monday, June 13 at 7:38 am
I wonder if you can sweeten the concentrate, and if so, how much sugar would you add? Or is it better to just sweeten it by the glass?
Angie P On Monday, June 13 at 7:38 am
I wonder if you can sweeten the concentrate, and if so, how much sugar would you add? Or is it better to just sweeten it by the glass?
Sally On Monday, June 13 at 8:01 am
Angie P — It’s better to sweeten it by the glass. If you like it really sweet, the sugar might not all dissolve, so you might want to consider making a simple syrup and using that instead.
SteffiWeffi On Monday, June 13 at 8:23 am
I’m also a former barista and I use this method with Chai Lattes too. Instead of pouring sugar in the coffee/tea in the cup, I make a simple syrup sugar:water (I use 2:1), boil, allow to cool, then pour that in the concetrate.
cook4ever On Monday, June 13 at 10:57 am
This is good information about the lack of bitterness in this coffee because you do not use hot water. I do not like cream or sugar in coffee and I thought I would not be able to try this with good results. Now I know better. It looks awesome, I use organic coffee so that will certainly help with the taste.
sarajo On Monday, June 13 at 3:14 pm
I love, love, love iced coffee! I’ll have to try the cold brew technique. I’ve started making a simple syrup and stashing it in the fridge. It takes just a few minutes to do, and then you don’t have to worry about the sugar not dissolving. I used to need milk in mine, but i’ve gotten to the point where I can do coffee, ice and a splash or two of simple syrup. The sweetened condensed milk version is really, really good, though!
Thanks for the info about lack of bitterness using this cold brew method.
We used fresh brewed coffee put into containers in fridge at our coffee shop
but I am betting this cold brew method will be amazing.
Peace
Rachael On Monday, June 13 at 6:53 pm
This is so true about sweetness. I barely sweeten my iced coffee. The cold brew method seems to almost bring out chocolate undertones. Mmmm.
Lisa On Tuesday, June 14 at 11:28 am
Maggie is absolutely right; the cold-brewed coffee tastes significantly different (better!) than the hot-brewed then cooled coffee does. For that reason I wouldn’t freeze regular brewed coffee into ice cubes because it will give the cold-brewed coffee a different flavor. I am an only-drink-it-sweet hot coffee girl and I don’t even need or want much sweetner with the cold-brewed. Sally’s idea about making a simple syrup is great because it’s hard to get sugar to dissolve in cold liquid. I make a much smaller quantity of the cold brew concentrate in my french press which lasts me several days. You have to try this!! It is soooo good.
Elicia On Wednesday, June 29 at 2:02 pm
For those of you who don’t use regular sugar, but like sweetened and flavored coffees like Vanilla Lattes and Mochas, at my local grocery and organic foods stores they have small bottles of liquid Stevia concentrate mixed with extracts like Chocolate and Vanila and so on. I love how easy it is to carry in my purse, and I am going to try it in this cold-press coffee version. You can add 5-10 drops -to taste- to your coffee, so the bottle lasts forever. I’m still using one I purchased in March.

Courtney On Monday, June 13 at 6:34 am

Jeanette On Monday, June 13 at 6:38 am
What an inventive idea! I have never seen coffee made this way. I thought the only way to brew coffee was with hot water. I would definitely give this method a try. Thanks for sharing :). I don’t know if this means I’ve been living under a rock, but I have never heard of Imbibe magazine.

12
Aaron On Monday, June 13 at 6:42 am
I’ve been doing this for years as well. 2 cups of ground coffee to 9 cups of water. I’ve also found that steeping much longer than 12 hours causes the bitterness of the beans we’re trying to avoid to leech out into the brew, so I’d recommend no more than 12-13 hours. Also, no sense buying an expensive contraption like the Toddy Maker when 2 normal sized pitchers will do the trick. If you like your coffee black as I do, I use a half coffee, half water mixture. Nice to see other people discovering this awesome thing!
13
Stephanie On Monday, June 13 at 6:43 am
All I have to say is YUM. I will try the iced coffee with skim milk tomorrow morning! I will try the eagle brand milk and half and half next weekend!! (I save my splurges for the weekend.)
Aunt Dee On Monday, June 13 at 1:43 pm
I just tried it with some leftover Keurig french roast, and fat free half and half, and it was pretty darned refreshing!
14
Jennie On Monday, June 13 at 6:44 am
Ooo, I’m going to try this. It looks good. Thanks Ree. I also agree with the first commenter. I have a bag of coffee cubes in my freezer so when they melt it’s no biggy! Also, I like to crunch them at the end.
JugglingMom4 On Saturday, August 6 at 12:49 pm
Ditto on the ice cubes. I have stopped buying iced coffee at the coffee shop because I have superior ice cubes at home.
I don’t have the storage space at home to make such a large batch, so I use my french press to make a cold-brew cup overnight to be ready in the morning–one cup at a time. . .and no need to strain with a separate strainer. =)
15
Andrea P On Monday, June 13 at 6:45 am
I have long enjoyed coffee concentrate. My grandma had a Filtron coffee contraption that I inherited. I have terrific memories of Grandma’s coffee. Now, I will just have to try the Vietnamese version. And maybe a coffee smoothie too.

Heather (Heather's Dish) On Monday, June 13 at 6:45 am
i have to agree, iced coffee is pure nectar for me as well! so good, especially in the summer (although in the winter i still drink it and just wear a heavier jacket)!
17
Jennifer Jo On Monday, June 13 at 6:46 am
I love this stuff—make it all summer long.
Here’s a hint: when straining the coffee, just pull the cheesecloth into a bunch at the top and squeeze. The coffee goes right through—no waiting. And, as we all know, time is of the essence when you’re needing that glass of iced coffee.
18
Michelleq On Monday, June 13 at 6:46 am
Wow, that’s a big batch of iced coffee!!!! Does it get bitter as it ages in the fridge? 3 weeks seems like a long time to hold it without sacrificing flavor.
Kristin @ Country Fried Egg Roll On Sunday, July 3 at 2:34 am
I think it gets stale tasting (not really bitter, but more sour) after a week. If I’m not going to use it by them, I do as most others suggest and freeze it into cubes.
19
mary b On Monday, June 13 at 6:46 am
I recently read about a cold brew method, but had yet to try it. Looks easy though, you’ve convinced me.
Love iced coffee! No sugar and some light cream for me.
It is also good when you toss some cinnamon in with the grounds, I wonder if that will work w/the cold brew method.

That’s the way I like iced coffee Mary! I’ll have to try this cold brewed thing!

How do you store the left over sweetened condensed milk? And, for how long is it good after you open it? THANK YOU for this recipe- because I have the same exact problem with iced coffee– and I am going right now to make this concentrate- I can’t WAIT !
Kirsten is Comfortably Domestic On Monday, June 13 at 9:37 am
You can store sweetened condensed milk in an airtight container in the refrigerator for-what-seems-like-ever. Seems like I always have a little sweetened condensed milk in the fridge, waiting to be included in a new recipe. On the iced coffee front–I am not a coffee drinker, but the lack of bitter notes, and the addition of sweetened condensed milk/half & half might just draw me in. Sounds delicious!
Neena On Monday, June 13 at 10:39 am
I store the extra condensed milk in an old honey bear, but you could use any squeezy bottle. Makes for easy dispensing into coffee or oatmeal (my fave!)
Stephanie On Monday, June 13 at 5:02 pm
who has leftover sweetened condensed milk?!?!?

I’m so glad you shared this recipe!!! Who’s the best PW? You are!
Ree On Monday, June 13 at 7:14 am
Kathy, it’s definitely 8 quarts/2 gallons of water. This makes a bunch of concentrate, so you can definitely halve the recipe if you’d like.
Kathy On Tuesday, June 21 at 7:06 pm
1 lb of ground coffee is 5 cups dry. Just start halving the recipe, till you find the right size for you to work with. I cut it down to a quart to begin with and it was great. Time to make some more.
Meg Manion Silliker On Thursday, June 23 at 3:25 pm
crap – i read it as 8 cups of water too!! i added more water but the original batch has been steeping for 8 hours – have i just ruined it by adding the h2o this late in the game?!
Ann from Montana On Saturday, July 30 at 5:39 pm
I reduced the whole thing to ounces and make the same proportions:
2 ounces ground coffee
32 ounces water (4 cups)
I have a Chemex pot and filters so I pour my mix through a filter into the Chemex and the resulting concentrate fills 1 large mason jar – perfect for me as I don’t have the frig storage space for the amount that Ree makes.
Many Thanks to Ree for the whole enlightenment of concentrate. IT IS WONDERFUL!!!
*** I make a cinnamon simple syrup and use that, the concentrate and half and half – major YUM!

Blind Horse On Monday, June 13 at 7:03 am
Fascinating, but for those of us hardy souls who drink our iced coffee black, is this going to be too strong?
I make all my coffee in a french press, for iced coffee I simply brew with half the hot water, then add ice until it’s full. The ice melts, making the brew strength just right, I press out the grounds and pour over more ice. Divine!
Sally On Monday, June 13 at 8:12 am
I always drink my coffee black and this is not too strong. It’s very mellow; very good. This is edging out iced tea as my go-to summer drink, at least at home.
Blind Horse On Monday, June 13 at 1:04 pm
Thanks Sally! I’ll try it as is and adjust from there.
Abby On Monday, June 13 at 9:27 pm
You can just add water instead of milk. It is still concentrated without it. You can even add water and *heat* it. It’s so much less bitter and the flavors are amazing.
Slicey On Tuesday, June 21 at 10:24 am
Cold Press is a concentrate, so you should definitely add some ice water if you’re going to drink it black.

Sarah On Monday, June 13 at 7:27 am
I recently played around with making a frappacino (sp?). I used the coffee ice cubes mentioned above and blended them with cold coffee. The results were okay, but I think I could achieve greatness with your cold coffee, a blender and frozen coffee cubes.
37
Christine On Monday, June 13 at 7:27 am
Who knew?! I love this idea. Bur I’ll be using SOY MILK in my iced coffee – I discovered soy lattes several years ago, and was hooked. I don’t make true lattes at home, just strong coffee about half and half with soy milk. You get lots of creaminess from regular soy milk with at least half the calories of half & half.
liz On Monday, June 13 at 7:40 am
Almond milk is also very tasty in iced coffee.

Mariesa On Monday, June 13 at 7:30 am
Thank you for sharing this! I’ve really be thinking about how to make iced coffee now that it’s jumped from cold to super hot here on the east coast. This is great! I might have to fiddle with the amounts since I think I’ll only have enough room for a pitcher in my fridge unfortunately.

Allyn On Monday, June 13 at 7:34 am
Yum!!!!!!!! I always mean to start making this at the beginning of every summer, and I always forget. Not this year! It’s the perfect lazy way to start the morning, which is key in my book. We used to make it secretly when I worked at Starbucks. Now, to find room in my fridge….

Janet On Monday, June 13 at 7:37 am
what are your thoughts on adding the condensed milk to the original mixture so that when you pour it, it is ready to go? would that work or would it go bad?
Sandi On Monday, June 13 at 10:34 am
That’s exactly what I came here to ask. Particularly for those of us not making gallons at a time, it seems a lot easier. Then it would be just pour and drink. I don’t drink coffee often, and pretty much never like it hot unless it has a ton of chocolate and sugar in it, but I have found I do enjoy the occasional iced coffee, especially from flavored coffee beans. Drinking one every day is most definitely not on my weight loss plan, however!
Gen On Tuesday, June 14 at 6:26 am
If you want to sweeten your concentrate once it’s been filtered, that might be fine. I do believe you would be decreasing it’s shelf like. I don’t think it would last as long as 3 weeks anymore. So, if you plan on drinking it up quick.
I do not find it hard to sweeten my cold coffee to my liking. It’s already fast enough that you’re not brewing it etc. Just dump the concentrate in and some water/milk and some sugar. I sometimes use flavored coffee mates to sweeten mine.
46

Beth On Monday, June 13 at 7:42 am
Skipping the brewing is key to coffee that I consider drinkable! Way less of that bitter awfulness going on with cold press. A friend in college did this to make regular coffee as well. She let it soak for a good 24 hours, though, so it was more like coffee syrup. Just add hot water instead of cold to reach your desired strength, and you’re good to go.
49
Sarah On Monday, June 13 at 7:43 am
We’ve been making it like this in my house for ages, except we go through that much concentrate in about a week. We drink it almost straight, we might be a little too hardcore if you ask me.

Leighann On Monday, June 13 at 7:46 am
Deb over @ Smitten Kitchen posted the New York Times recipe for this a few years back and I’ve been in love ever since. I do a smaller batch with 2 quarts of water and 1 3/4 cps of coffee. Strain into a gallon container and water down to your taste (it is UBER strong before you thin it out). I put in at least another quart of water each time. Will try the Viet version as that is something I’ve loved for years!!
City Girl to Country Girl On Monday, June 13 at 9:25 am
I remember that NYT recipe and the many, many, many coffees I made from it. It was goood. That was when I was going though a massive iced coffee phase and would make the coffee at home AND order Caramel Macchiatos at Starbucks everyday after work. I also remember I had to ditch regular and move on to decaf that year because of the perma shakes! lol.

Leighann On Monday, June 13 at 11:54 am
I could not wait to try the Viet version, and as I made a big ole pitcher of this coffee yesterday, I just had to swing by the grocery store on the way home from work for lunch for a can of the sweetened condensed milk.

How much coffee do you add for 1/2 gallon?
KarenH On Monday, June 13 at 2:12 pm
The original recipe we used was 1/3 cup coffee to 1 1/3 cups water. I think for the large mason jar we generally put in 1 1/2 cups coffee, more if we aren’t using a dark or french roast.
Sally On Monday, June 13 at 3:42 pm
joy78, for a half-gallon I’d use 2 cups of ground coffee.

Jen On Monday, June 13 at 7:57 am
A much smaller (and easier) batch works much the same way if you put coffee grounds in a french press, fill with water and let sit overnight. You end up with two good cups, no big bins to wash,and can throw it together fresh every night!

OMG! Yes! Yes! Yes! It is hot enough here in New Orleans now that all I drink is iced coffee. Thank you for the fabulous tip, it will definitely save the wallet when I’m tempted to stop in the shop below work and pick up an iced one on the way into the office!
MMMMM…Iced coffee on a hot day. What a delish pick me up!

Mmm. When I lived in Italy I had a caffe shakerato everyday during the summer. You pour a double espresso with a teaspoon of sugar over ice, give it a good shake (cocktail style) and strain it into a glass. Perfect for a post gelato pick-me-up!
Sally On Monday, June 13 at 3:56 pm
I just read about that on an Italian food blog last week. Sounds like a great pick-me-up.

I use Agave Syrup for sweetening, I find it dissolves nicely. I also use this method in smaller quantities. I do 2/3 cup of coffee grounds to 3 cups of water in a big Mason Jar and leave it overnight.
Elf M. Sternberg On Monday, June 13 at 10:45 pm
Ditto on the Agave. Stuff’s a miracle. You don’t have to wait forever for the sugar to dissolve, which it rarely wants to do, in the cold stuff. If you can find it, though, simple syrup with a touch of light, unsulfered molasses is also amazing.
Elicia On Wednesday, June 29 at 2:10 pm
I love lAgave nectar too, but I also love liquid Stevia, and especially the varieties with Vanilla and Chocolate extract!!

We brew ours in a 1/2 gallon Mason jar and filter it though a Melitta cone so it doesn’t take up a lot of room but we do have to make it more often to keep with the the demand.

Beth in Illinois On Monday, June 13 at 8:04 am

Kierstan @ Life {and running} in Iowa On Monday, June 13 at 8:05 am
I have been just brewing a large pot of coffee in the morning so I can have my 2 piping hot glasses right away and then stowing the rest of the pot in the fridge so I can have some iced coffee later in the day. Not as great as it could be, but it works.
I am going to have to give this method a try!

Phyllis On Monday, June 13 at 8:06 am
Ree… thank you for posting this. I love, love, love iced coffee and have been drinking it for well over 20 years. (Living in a tropical climate will do that for you!) I have never tried the cold brewed method, let alone I have never heard of it. I will be doing so tomorrow.
I also love you are using Cafe Bustelo. The only coffee good enough for iced coffees I believe. I can no longer buy Bustelo where I live (out of the US) and when friends ask what to send me for birthday or, Christmas gifts, I always answer, Bustelo coffee.
Now I just have to find a container big enough to do this in.
One question; when you cover the coffee with the water, do you leave out of the frig on the counter or, does it need refrigeration?
Thanks again Ree.

This is the system I have been using for years – it is basically the same thing that you are already doing, just a little less complicated. I was just thinking if someone else wanted to make there own, this system might be a little bit easier.

Simple Girl On Monday, June 13 at 8:07 am
Sweetened condensed milk has such a unique, beautiful flavor! I also love to use it in icing glazes, or Chai Tea, or….. now iced coffee!
73
Sally On Monday, June 13 at 8:07 am
I used to use the Toddy, but now I make it this way using this formula:
I generally triple the amounts. Cold brewed coffee is so much smoother than coffee made with hot water, though I like both.
When I’m feeling the need for something decadent, the Vietnamese coffee hits the spot. So good!

joy78 On Monday, June 13 at 8:08 am
I LOVE LOVE LOVE iced coffee. Starbucks is by far the best but McD’s will do in a pinch (esp since its only $1)!!! I can’t drink the whole cup so I can make a Venti last me 2 days! YUM!!!!
I am definitely a cream person, after all I use cream in my hot coffee so why not in my cold coffee! I could never leave a big pitcher like that in my fridge since my kids would always be sneaking it (and then bouncing off the walls)!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
One thing I would change is instead of using sugar to make simple syrup and add that. I find the sugar take too long to dissolve. Plus thats what they use at Starbucks. Sorry Ree but we have a Starbucks 2 minutes from my house!! The good thing is parking is horrible so it prevents me from going too often!
I will definitely be trying this method. Now I just have to figure out how much the measurements are since you used weight for the coffee. Any tips?
Matt K On Monday, June 13 at 9:28 am
ditto the simple syrup. when adding sugar to a cold drink, it just doesn’t dissolve period. you just get crystals here and there when your straw hits the bottom of the cup. definitely need to use simple syrup if you want to sweeten it.
Deb C On Monday, June 13 at 4:22 pm
There ya go – a Mickey D’s large iced coffee w/cream and then I buy a container of chocolate milk. Take a good swig of the bitter stuff then add the chocolate milk – love sipping on the iced mocha the rest of the a.m.
Also, at home I warm up a half cup of milk, throw in a teaspon of folgers instant crystals – stir to dissolve, fill with ice and alternating whole milk and chocolate milk. Fast, easy, delicious.
Sandi On Monday, June 13 at 7:00 pm
16 oz per 8 qts = 2 oz per 1 qt, so I used the 4oz coffee I had with 2 qts of water
If you mean cups instead of ounces, there are about 5.5 cups in 16 oz coffee grounds, but I didn’t extrapolate the math further.
joy78 On Tuesday, June 14 at 4:44 pm
Thanks Sandi.
Margaret On Friday, June 17 at 10:10 am
I worked at Starbucks for many years. They brew double strength coffee with a blend they specially came up with for iced coffee called Terrazza. You can also buy Gazebo Blend in the summer months which makes a great iced coffee.
The measurements for hot brewed are 2 tablespoons of coffee for 6 oz. water. So iced coffee would take 4 tablespoons for 6 oz . water. Sounds like a lot, but it’s what gives the coffee the full, complex flavor. Simple syrup is used to sweeten.
They use a measuring beaker to get the right amount of ice cubes, sweetener and half-and -half.
Ann from Montana On Saturday, July 30 at 5:48 pm
YES to simple syrup. The “chemistry” of making the syrup is the magic. I make cinnamon syrup (simple syrup of 1 cup water, 1 cup sugar, add 4 cinnamon sticks after the sugar is disolved in the water and frig overnight then remove sticks). 1/2 concentrate, 1/2 half and half and cinnamon syrup to taste. That’s my brew :)!

Oh my! This makes me want to drink coffee again. I used to make iced coffee (hot poured over a ton of ice) during the hot summers.
Maybe I can do the same with decaf. I haven’t been able to drink caffeine for the last year due to stomach issues. But I sure do miss it!

I’m an iced coffee fanatic as well, I start drinking it in February or March to help will spring and summer to come sooner. I’ve been using a Bodum Iced coffee press that I received for Christmas that works pretty well, but I can’t wait to try this method. It would be great to have such a large batch!
82
KimV. On Monday, June 13 at 8:20 am
I’ve been doing this for a few years now and it is truly wonderful-makes a great extract that’s super concentrated, rich and smooth without bitterness. And it can really pack a punch. The ratio I use ( I think it came from a recipe in the NY Times) is 1 lb. course ground coffee to 10 cups water and I let it stand overnight at room temp. before filtering into a decanter for the fridge. Yummy and easy- just like Ree says.
83
Meredith On Monday, June 13 at 8:20 am

Natalie On Monday, June 13 at 8:24 am
I had gastric bypass 2 years ago and the acid from regular coffee is too harsh on my ‘pouch’ to drink all the time. Cold brew has 60% less acid, for those of you that get heart burn! Also – you can use the ground twice. I let my concentrate sit for 48 hours and it is super concentrated, only a few table spoons and some cold water!
I use this system and love the look of it on my counter.
Dana On Monday, June 20 at 8:49 pm
Natalie,
I ordered the Hourglass Coffee maker last week… well, the one offered in the Sky Mall catalog… Same one, but different name (Natural Health Coffee Maker.) After ordering I received an email that it was backordered, just like they are on the hourglasscoffee.com site… soooooooo disappointed. I was also looking forward to better tasting coffee with less acid and less teeth staining!
I may have to try Ree’s method in the meantime…….

My Mom used to make iced coffee in the summertime. I remember that she poured cooled coffee into ice-cube trays and froze them so she could ice down her coffee without diluting it. I thought that was genius and I do the same. You can sweeten the coffee ice-cubes, too. Just a thought. You may enjoy. At any rate, it made me think of my mother, which is always a good thing.

Mim On Monday, June 13 at 8:31 am
Oh glorious day! Thanks for this one Ree! I’ve been using the hot brew method for iced coffee, because I have a Keurig. I use to make a big pot of coffee when I had a regular coffee maker, about 2 qts worth, then add a can of sweetened condensed milk, mix it all up and put it in the fridge to chill. Now I can try the cold brew method and have an abundance of ice coffee again. Thank you thank you thank you. :0)

Laura Bradshaw On Monday, June 13 at 8:33 am
Doesn’t the coffee cubes take on a funny, freezery taste? Not that I’m a connoissesur.
Carla On Saturday, August 20 at 2:42 pm
Didn’t notice this in the comments; but didn’t read them all. Yet.
What she didn’t mention is that cold brewing coffee like this (or similar) takes all the acidity out of it. No bitterness! No upset stomach for those who have trouble with coffee. Even cheap coffee comes out fairly decent when brewed this way.
Once you get used to it, coffee brewed the normal way tastes like cigarette ashes. It really does spoil a person!
They do make cold brew pots – I like the hourglass one. It makes enough coffee extract for me to have 2-3 cups of coffee (hot or iced) for a week and a half or two weeks. I take a jar to work and I keep some at home. It’s really great! I take it on the road when I travel.
And I just opened a can of scm; i’ll have to try the vietnamese idea.
Carla On Saturday, August 20 at 2:46 pm
I bought a couple of covered ice cube trays on Amazon – not very expensive. That should prevent the cubes from absorbing freezer odors.
Steer clear of the one they have that’s like a circular tube. It’s a pain to get the cubes popped out and it didn’t last long. Stick with the flat covered ones.

The Electoral Court has ruled that a full inquiry will be heard in an application seeking the resignation of IEC chairperson Pansy Tlakula.
IEC chairperson Pansy Tlakula. (M&G)
The Electoral Court ruled on Tuesday that a full inquiry would be heard in an application seeking the resignation of IEC chairperson Pansy Tlakula.
"We are of the opinion that the matter needs further clarity," Judge Lotter Wepener said.
The court – sitting in the high court in Johannesburg – would hear the inquiry on Friday at 10am. This gave Tlakula sufficient time to file the necessary affidavit, he said.
The court was hearing an application by opposition parties to have Tlakula resign as Electoral Commission of South Africa (IEC) chair. The court spent Tuesday listening to arguments from the opposition parties and Tlakula on the urgency of the application.
'Not enough time'
Daniel Berger SC, for Tlakula, argued that there was not enough time for her to file an affidavit in response to the application. "She will have to leave the commission to respond—it's undesirable and unpractical," he said.
"To formulate an affidavit of this magnitude is a huge task. She doesn't have to be put through that."
Berger said the court should deal with the matter after the national elections which would give Tlakula enough time to respond.
However, Wepener highlighted the importance of the matter and told Berger that it was a "serious matter" and if it required a person to stand back and deal with it, they should.
David Unterhalter SC, for the political parties, told the court it would be a misconduct for Tlakula to remain in her office for the upcoming national elections. "You need to make a recommendation that she simply cannot continue to occupy this office," Unterhalter said.
"The matter is urgent because the looming election makes it necessary, where parties believe that the commission is headed by someone who is not suitable."
Unterhalter added: "If the election comes and goes and this person presides over that election, we have done a disservice to South African citizens." – SapaFirst Class Petty Officer Jason Phillips, formally of Craig, has been awarded the Sailor of the Year Award.
The Army Times Publishing Company annually presents the Sailor of the Year Award to an outstanding sailor. Criteria considered in the award include heroism, patriotism and selfless service to country. Servicemen nominate and vote for candidates for the award.
Getting Phillips to talk about himself is like pulling teeth. He'll talk about his men, wife and son, using deliberative words of praise, but he's more reserved when speaking about himself. And maybe that is part of the reason he received the award.
In his own words, the Sailor of the Year Award recognizes "hard work and achievements." He figures he received it because, as an intelligence specialist, he leads the 18 men under his command well. And that is really all he has to say on the subject.
Phillips graduated from Moffat County High School in 1991 and joined the Navy two and a half months later, because his dad, Jim Phillips, who Jason describes as his idol, was a Navy man, serving four years before Jason was born.
Now it's 12 years later and Phillips says he loves the Navy, but he can still remember his first day of service. He felt a bit different then.
"I didn't know what I'd done," Phillips said during a phone interview from his home at Fallon Naval Air Station in Fallon, Nev.
He remembers waking up with a shaved head. A first class petty officer was yelling at him. There was a lot of yelling that first day. He was sent from one place to another, going through enlistment work. He remembers that day as being full of confusion.
Now he sees helping newly enlisted sailors adjust to the Navy as one of his main job duties. Remembering his own first day of military service enables him to do that job.
"Guys in the Navy have to put up with things that normal people won't put up with," Phillips said. "They're away from their home and family. They're always being yelled at and have little freedom."
Phillips works to show his men that the Navy isn't a bad thing, even though they may think it is at first. He tries to support them by being a base of knowledge for them, by building a relationship of understanding, and treating everyone fairly.
He acknowledges that the Navy isn't for everyone, but it still makes him mad to hear new sailors badmouthing his branch of the armed forces.
Conversely, one of the main thrills of his job is when he sees a young sailor fall in love with the Navy.
"It's usually after their first enlistment," he said. "You know it's happened when you hear the pride in their voice. That's when they see the good they're doing, when they see the big picture."
Phillips enjoys the Navy so much, he's staying on for the 20-year long haul. There's no doubt in his mind he's going to stay with it till retirement.
Phillips' career has taken him to 13 different countries, including several Middle East nations and Italy. His wife, Angie Phillips, also a Moffat County High School graduate, said she loves Italy, and her husband praises her for the way she adapted to Italian culture.
"Angie is tougher than I am," he said. "She learned to speak Italian and was always talking to the neighbors. There's no challenge she doesn't take on."
Phillips began his service as a weapons technician aboard the USS Roosevelt. But he soon grew bored with that position, and he began serving as an intelligence specialist, the capacity in which he still serves today.
In 1997, Phillips served in Bahrain, an archipelago of sand islands in the Persian Gulf, between Saudi Arabia and Qatar.
In Bahrain, Phillips was responsible for analysis of enemy intelligence and identification of threats to troops. He had to understand enemy culture so that he could better guess what their tactics might be.
That boils down to one main responsibility to protect American troops.
Phillips is currently stationed at Fallon Naval Air Station, where he lives with his wife and their two sons, the elder age five and the younger nine months of age.
His sons are too young yet for him to tell the effect all the moving has had on them, but he suspects they will handle it well, not because of him but because of his wife.
After hearing Phillips talk about the life he's had with the Navy, it isn't surprising that Phillips recommends the military to others as a path through their lives.
"It gives you a chance at responsibility," he said. "I grew up in the Navy."

Fundraiser for town pool to be held at Nennie’s this Sunday
NEW IPSWICH — A fundraiser will be held this weekend to raise money to purchase a computer to be used at the New Ipswich Town Pool.
Pool Director Elizabeth Pogorzelski is organizing a cookout at Nennie’s 5 Star Café in New Ipswich on Sunday from 3 to 7 p.m. Tickets are $10 and include a meal of hot dogs and hamburgers with cookout fixings. Tickets are available for purchase at the pool during regular swim hours prior to the cookout.
Proceeds from the fundraiser will go toward purchasing a computer that will be used to check people in at the pool and to organize swim meets, according to Pogorzelski.
“We are looking to raise as much money as we can. We are fundraising for the pool: specifically a computer,” wrote Pogorzelski in an email interview Monday. “This way we can check people into the pool electronically with barcode passes, update medical forms, run swim meets, print stickers for swim ribbons, etc.”
Pogorzelski said the goal is to raise at least $500 to pay for the computer, but additional funds will be needed for software, a scanner for the barcode pass and a printer. Any money left over will go toward equipment for the pool’s swim team, for practice equipment such as kickboards, pull buoys and hand paddles.
So far this year, the pool has raised $400 toward these costs through swimathons, bake sales, pool movie nights and cookout tickets sold to date.
In other pool news, the following changes have been made to classes held at the pool; parent-child classes are now held every Wednesday from 1 to 1:30 p.m. Water aerobics classes will be held July 14, July 18, July 24 and July 29 and Aug. 8, Aug. 12, Aug. 18, Aug. 19 and Aug. 22 from 11 to 11:30 a.m. Both classes are come-as-you-can at a cost of $5 per class.

Violinist Joshua Bell will play Tchaikovsky’s beloved Violin Concerto, while guest conductor Andrey Boreyko will conduct HKPO in Prokofiev’s Symphony No.5 and Vasks’s Musica Dolorosa. Swire Maestro: Joshua Bell plays Tchaikovsky is a celebratory programme of the 10th anniversary of the establishment of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region. Swire Classic Insights Pre-Concert talks, free admission and open to the public, will be held from 7.15pm to 7.45pm on the Level 4 Foyer of the Cultural Centre Concert Hall. Benedict Cruft, Dean of Music of the Hong Kong Academy for Performing Arts will speak on Friday, while Leung Kin-fung, Swire First Associate Concertmaster of HKPO will speak in Cantonese on Saturday.
“Classical superstar” violinist Joshua Bell has captivated audiences worldwide with his poetic musicality. He just won the prestigious Avery Fisher prize, joining the ranks of such previous recipients as cellist Yo-Yo Ma, pianists Emanuel Ax, violinists Midori and the Emerson String Quartet. In 2005, he was inducted into the Hollywood Bowl Hall of Fame. In 2004, Billboard Magazine named his best-selling record “Romance of the Violin” Classical Album of the Year and Bell the Classical Artist of the Year. Bell plays on the precious 1713 Gibson ex Huberman Stradivarius. This will be the fifth time Joshua Bell is returning to play with the Hong Kong Philharmonic.
The Russian conductor Andrey Boreyko is one of the most exciting and dynamic conductors to emerge from Eastern Europe in recent years. He is currently Chief Conductor of the Hamburg Symphony Orchestra and Chief Conductor of Bern Symphony Orchestra, and has guest conducted such top-flight orchestras as the Amsterdam Concertgebouw, the Berlin Philharmonic and the Chicago Symphony. “Keep your eye on Boreyko… his personal future sky seems to have no limit.” (, March 2005)
One of the “big four” violin concertos in the history of music, Tchaikovsky’s Violin Concerto has some of the most charming melodies and display of pyrotechnics for the soloist. The Fifth Symphony is Prokofiev’s signature work which he composed after returning to his homeland in the 1936. Contemporary Lithuanian composer Vasks’s Musica dolorosa for string orchestra tries to search for an answer to the never-ending question of human suffering.

I stumbled upon your site (Arguments Against) and was, at first, very angry. However, this anger wasn’t at your beliefs, or your sarcastic responses to the arguments placed against atheism. I was angry at the ignorance displayed by people that make use of said arguments.
I am a disciple of Jesus, and I am hesitant at calling myself a “Christian” because of the idiocy that many Christians display. As I was reading your “Arguments Against” page, I laughed at almost each one, simply because I’ve heard them all, and for the most part, they are very (very) weak. It amazes me that Christians actually think these arguments are legitimate.
Most Christians that encounter an atheist immediately want to argue and debate–to tear down. I have to admit, at first I thought your site was going to be a typical “I hate Christianity” site, but after reading some of your correspondence, I was compelled to think differently. You mentioned your reason for not having a forum, or a discussion board, and I agree completely. Every “Christianity v. Atheism” forum on the internet eventually turns into hogwash–there seems to exist very little productive discussion. It’s usually a Christian attacking an Atheist, and then the Atheist striking right back, or vice versa.
I’m glad to see that you encourage productive, civil discussion and debate.
Thanks for the nice note. Sadly, I have heard every single one of the items on the Arguments page — most of them more than once. Sometimes they are the result of simple ignorance, and I don’t think less of someone just because they don’t know something (well, unless they are going out of their way not to know it). But sometimes they are used as “zingers” that will, the speaker hopes, shut down an atheist and show the foolishness of atheism. Ironically, when a well-informed atheist has a response to the “zinger,” the conversation generally ends anyway, since the questioner seldom knows how to continue the discussion. This is just sad. I wish that we could all discuss our differences and opinions without worrying about who will “win” a given conversation.
I should also point out that for every lame argument against atheism, there is a lame argument against theism. Ignorance works both ways.
Please don’t hesitate to call yourself a Christian just because some Christians are idiots. I call myself an atheist even though there are plenty of seriously annoying atheists out there.
The point of this site is to spark discussion and generate understanding. I’m glad that you are with me on this — I think that willingness to civilly share ideas is often more important than what those ideas actually are.By Peter Saunders
Some franchises fit well-defined industry parameters, but others seem to appear out of the blue. So it was when Canada’s first Sky Zone Indoor Trampoline Park opened in Mississauga, Ont., in November 2011. The closest point of comparison may be a bowling alley, as families and groups of friends flock to a dedicated indoor facility for ‘pay-to-play’ entertainment—but in this case, to literally bounce off the walls.
“Our original idea, back in 2002, was to start a new professional sport,” explains Jeff Platt, CEO. “We soon realized that would cost tens of millions of dollars, so instead we opened our research and development (R&D) centre as a trampoline park to the public. No one had done this before and there were no experts we could go to. We had to grow the concept organically and develop our own procedures.”
The first location opened in 2004 in Las Vegas, Nev., following refinement of the business model. The second opened in 2006 in St. Louis, Mo., to test the concept’s appeal in more of a typical city market.
Franchising began after a third location opened in 2008 in Sacramento, Calif. Five franchises opened across the U.S. in 2010.
“My sister-in-law opened the franchise in Boston, Mass., and I saw it in January 2011, filled with happy people,” says Caroline Irving, who soon became the first Canadian franchisee. “I was so impressed and intrigued. I knew it would work in Toronto.”
Irving credits her strong faith in the business model not only to market research, but also to ‘mom research.’
“I have five kids and I want them off the couch, doing something active and healthy,” she says. “Canadians spend a lot of money on their children. And everyone loves trampolines. They appeal to kids for their birthday parties, to teenagers who love dodgeball and to parents seeking a simple pleasure that’s not technological. The concept offers something for everyone.”
She began speaking with Platt and looking for properties in the Greater Toronto Area (GTA) by February. By May, when she signed a multiple-unit franchise agreement, she was deep into negotiations for her first facility, a former indoor soccer field in Mississauga, just west of Toronto. She took possession on September 1 and was open for business on November 8. It was soon bustling, with a typical Saturday seeing 14 birthday parties booked.
“I hope to open a location within Toronto proper next,” says Irving. “I want somewhere big enough that people can get to easily. Then we’ll head east to Ajax or Pickering, Ont. The idea is to open the second location within a year and then the third on in the next year.”
Platt is pursuing franchising opportunities in other parts of the country, too.
“We’re looking at cities like Vancouver and Montreal, so long as we can find the right partner,” he says. “It’s not a cheap investment. A facility like this costs several million dollars to buy and build out.”

Macrospace
Interview by: Andreas Misund Berntsen
Wireless phone gaming is becoming more and more of a reality in our everyday life. Macrospace is the leading provider of wireless gaming solutions to network operators, service providers, portals, handset manufacturers and brand owners. The company's products and services enable its customers to rapidly launch secure, reliable, cost effective and revenue generating services. With expertise in single and multiplayer gaming, web emulation and content provisioning, Macrospace is uniquely positioned to offer complete end-to-end solutions ranging from content development through to final delivery and billing. ProvisionX?, the company's fully managed provisioning solution, is the most widely deployed content download service worldwide.
Hi, can you introduce yourself and your company to our readers?
Hi, my name is Kim Daniel Arthur, and I work as a part of the games team at Macrospace. Macrospace is the leading provider of wireless gaming solutions to network operators, service providers, portals, handset manufacturers and brand owners. As a company we have a range of technologies for over-the-air game delivery and web emulation, but my involvement is purely on the games side of the business.
What does your job at Macrospace involve, and how did you get it?
Together with the guys in the games team at Macrospace I take part in most areas of the game development process. As a developer my main focus is coding both the games and in-house development tools. Creating a game is very much a team effort and we all work very closely throughout the whole process, from initial game concepts to the final touches.
Although we all have our roles within the games team, be it game or level designer, developer or artist we very much get involved in all stages of the development process, and this makes our jobs both varied very exciting.
I'm sure not all the readers know enough about wireless game development, so can you tell us a bit about J2ME, and how it has matured.
Java is a technology developed by Sun Microsystems, with the aim of creating applications that run on any compatible device from any manufacturer. There are several ?flavours? of Java, and the version for small devices like phones and PDAs is called Java 2 Micro Edition, or J2ME. J2ME together with MIDP (Mobile Information Device Profile) is a development platform tailored specifically for mobile devices, and is the basis of most downloadable mobile games. It allows developers to target a whole range of mobile devices from all of the major manufacturers, and the tools and development environments our developers use are now very well established thanks to the support from the wider Java community.
J2ME or MIDP as a platform has been around for a few years now, and nearly all modern handsets incorporate this technology. These days most phones will have "Java support", meaning they can run games developed for the J2ME/MIDP platform.
Both the phones with Java support and the mobile games themselves have matured a lot during the last year or so; not so long ago most people used low-end black and white handsets with slow processors and small screens (96x65 pixels was common). Today, most phones are capable of running games, with full colour, decent sized screens and polyphonic sound, so developing new games and applications is really exciting right now.
Do you think the technology is mature enough to allow real-time online gameplay between connected gamers?
The main factor when it comes to real-time online play is the time it takes data to travel from phone to phone, known as network latency. With the mobile networks that are most widespread now you are looking at an average of 1 to 2 seconds. This is very well suited for turn-based multiplayer games like
Macrospace?s CannonsME
or similar turn based strategy games. As for real-time multiplayer games, this could well become the ?next big thing? as the new mobile network standards are rolled out, with lower latency and greater bandwidth. Realistically, it is likely to be a year or two until online gaming on mobile phones is commonplace.
Could you tell us a bit about what the process of developing a J2ME game involves? For instance, how much time is spent planning?
The process of developing a J2ME game is very similar to that of programming a Gameboy Advance game or similar, although the scale of the projects in terms of both human and technical resources is quite a bit smaller. A lot of my time as a developer is spent upfront trying to find an interesting style and genre of game to develop ? a lot of ideas come from keeping my eyes and ears out for things that inspire me. Once the overall feel of the game has been decided, I develop a more detailed approach to the game idea, developing a series of concepts with the focus on how the gameplay and story might work, as well as some ideas of how the game will look visually.
The actual time spent programming and refining a game varies from 1-6 months, depending of the scale of the project. The game is continually tested and evaluated as you work on it, so it is very much a team effort. As you might suspect, attention to detail and meticulous planning is important to make a game that both plays well and looks good! At Macrospace we spend a lot of time and effort making sure the game runs as well as possible, which pays off when we get emails from happy gamers saying what fun they have playing our games.
From a technical standpoint, how far do you think wireless gaming will have come in a year or two, or maybe five?
Wireless gaming as we know it today is just the beginning. As technology
advances and people become more aware of mobile gaming I think it will expand to become a major industry in itself, much as console and PC gaming has become. For example location based systems combined with high bandwith wireless networks open up for whole new genres of gameplay that have yet to be explored.
Advances in graphics and sound will also make mobile gaming far more immersive, and many of the handset manufacturers are working on phones that can run 3D graphics, which would allow the sort of games we are used to seeing on the Playstation or GameCube to work just as well on a mobile phone. The advantage a phone has over any other gaming device is its connectivity, and I think there is huge scope for multiplayer games that can span different countries and time zones.
As of now, what trends do you see in the games people choose to play? Are there certain genres that people seem to prefer? Do you think this will change over time?
The mobile gaming market is still young and users seem to be a mix of "impulse" and "early adopters". The type of games that are popular on phones is quite similar to other areas of the game industry, with platform games and shoot ?em ups amongst the most popular right now. Users also seem to favour games with a well-known brand, and mobile versions of console or PC games are quite common. Having said that, consumers are also very good at identifying high quality games, so there is no chance for us developers to get complacent!
As the technology behind the games gets better there will be new ways of playing games, but I think there are only so many basic game types, from platformers to racing games.
It could be hard to estimate, but how long do you think it would take for an average hobby programmer to learn J2ME and learn enough to actually make something fun? Do you have any tips or recommended books?
The good thing with developing for J2ME is that all the tools you need are free, and for those that have programmed for other flavours of Java before, there are more similarities than differences. It is important to understand the limitations of the target device both in terms of speed and available memory before you dive into a new game project, and looking at what other developers have done is a good source of inspiration and techniques.
The tools provided from
Sun Microsystems
are very user friendly and will get you up and running quickly, and browsing through the provided demo games also gives a good introduction on how to get started.
There are many online resources related to J2ME and J2ME programming, see below for a quick list:
-
- IGN's wireless gaming section
- list of devices and device specs
- Another detailed list of Java devices
- easy to use publicly available fixed point library for J2ME
- Nokia's developer site, lots of news, tools and developer forums

Combat Arms: Line of Sight..What face will Sen. Dick Durbin (D-IL) be speaking out of today when he convenes a hearing before the US Senate Judiciary Subcommittee on the Constitution, Civil Rights and Human Rights at the behest of the Islamic grievance-mongering industry? It remains to be seen, but no doubt the topic of the Council on American-Islamic Relations (CAIR) will come up – an appropriate topic considering he has taken all sides on the issue with respect to CAIR.
Earlier this month, Durbin sent a letter to the CAIR-Chicago chapter hailing its “efforts to advocate for tolerance”:
CAIR-Chicago advances a greater understanding of the Muslim culture and serves as an essential thread in the multicultural fabric of our nation. Your efforts to advocate for tolerance promote the civil liberties of all communities.
Durbin had a much different opinion back in 2003 when he spoke up during a hearing of the Senate Judiciary Subcommittee on Terrorism and Homeland Security two years after 9/11, when he described CAIR as “unusual in its extreme rhetoric and its association with groups that are suspect.”
Has CAIR suddenly grown less extreme in its rhetoric and longtime association with international terrorist organizations? Are its supposed efforts to “advocate for tolerance” the reason why the FBI cut off all formal ties with CAIR in 2009?
Don’t expect the lapdog media to ask Sen. Durbin about his remarkable volte face with respect to CAIR.
Every time I hear about Islam’s much heralded “tolerance” I wish I had the speaker at arm’s reach.
At arm’s reach because it is much more imperative for such a speaker to answer your question when their collar is in the grasp of the questioner.
The question would be “When was the last time that CAIR advocated for tolerance for Israel?”
Would someone in reach of Dick Durbin’s collar please ask him that question?Enchanting vineyards
Travel Tales: Napa Valley
by Jen O'Neill
I.
Wine is Divine…
The valley’s original inhabitants, the Wappo Indians, saw the land’s potential when they named it “Napa” or “the land of plenty.” The arrangement of the rolling hills, elevation and the dramatic climate—warm, sunny days and cool nights— delivers the ideal combination for grapes to ripen slowly and consistently. The area's topography touts more than 30 different varieties of soils. One acre of land is home to between 900 and 1,300 vines—that’s a whopping 1,200 glasses of wine!
Source: Napa Chamber of Commerce
Proverbial Themes: The Grapes of Wrath
Life in the Napa Valley isn’t always as glorious as the perfectly aligned grapevine rows. If anything, the valley’s past is best symbolized by the twists and turns of a corkscrew. Behind the scenes, there are endless stories of migrant workers who have endured harsh conditions and oppressive situations. There are even the occasional stories of workers who have seen success with their own wineries. The Ceja Vineyards is one of my favorite rags to riches stories. Another incredible anecdote is of wine proprietor, Robert Mondavi, who overcame turbulent times to become the Napa Valley’s most prominent patriarchal figure.

Barrels at Alpha Omega Winery
So Much To Do…
There’s an endless array of sobering activities in Napa Valley. After an organic brunch, a hot air balloon ride swept my friends and me away so we could view the verdant vineyards from a bird’s perspective. Going in the opposite direction—down under—is equally enjoyable. The caves of Rutherford Hill Winery display 8,000 oak barrels of aging French and American wines. And my favorite activity is the grape stomp at St. Supery Winery—I am convinced this is the ultimate healing agent. On many occasions, my friends claimed that no credible winery would allow strangers to stomp on grapes and opted for another unrefined activity: to roll around in mud.
Source: NapaValley.com
Charm’s Way
Riding a bike is the best way to indulge in the town’s milieu and taste the delicious air. The slow life in Napa allows the possibility of making virtually nothing into something, and turning the mundane into the extraordinary. Br. Timothy’s Corkscrew Collection at the Culinary Institute of America at Greystone is a perfect example. As an up-and-coming artistic epicenter and culinary hub, there are many opportunities to engage all of the senses. And at the end of the day, no visit to Napa is complete without planting myself on a bench at V. Sattui Winery to begin my long goodbyes to the Valley. It’s never easy to make a clean break—luckily there’s a beginning and middle, but never a finale.

References:As the deadline for registering to vote nears, officials from many Massachusetts cities and towns say they are seeing a surge in interest, especially among young people.
Election offices will be open until 8 p.m. Wednesday to allow ample time for last-minute registrations — and people have been coming in by the hundreds, a Boston election official said.
“We’re swamped,” said Gerry Cuddyer, chairwoman of the Board of Election Commissioners in Boston. “It’s wonderful from our perspective.”
Cuddyer said city officials have noticed an increase in young voters, mostly due to active voter-registration campaigns on college campuses.
“Students are hoping to weigh in strongly in this election,” she said, adding that there has been a rise in Latino voters. “There are changing demographics in the city, and as they become part of the fabric of the city, they are interested in its future and the future as a nation.”
Tight races for president and US Senate in Massachusetts are also driving interest, analysts have said. The majority of registrations are for unenrolled, or independent, voters.
Outside Boston, officials also said they are experiencing an uptick in voter registration.
“People are coming in like crazy. I’ve never seen it like this, and I’ve been doing elections for 10 years,” said Richard Reyes, a senior clerk in the election office for the city of Lawrence. He said he and his colleagues have at least 200 forms each on their desks to process. “People have been coming back who haven’t voted in years.”
Reyes noted that his office has received more than 600 applications for absentee ballots, especially from students, and expects that number to reach 800.
Lawrence has nearly 40,000 registered voters and is expecting a 50 percent turnout, similar to that in the 2008 presidential election, said Lawrence City Clerk William Maloney.
In New Bedford, Election Commissioner Maria Tomasia said registration has been nonstop. “We had to add two more people on staff to help with typing and filing,” she said. “We just can’t keep up with it. It’s worse than 2008.”
In Plymouth, officials are expecting their highest-voter registration numbers to date as they approach 39,000, said Laurence Pizer, the town clerk. More than 60 percent of voters are registered as unenrolled, he said.
“As of last Wednesday, we were up to date with our voter registrations, but the pile has hit around 300,” Pizer said. “It’s overwhelming, but in a good way.”
In Wellesley, Town Clerk Kathleen Nagle told a different story. She said registration numbers appeared to be similar to those in the 2004 election.
Her office had received about 30 to 40 voter forms a day for the past few weeks, and most have arrived by mail. She noted that there has been a large number of absentee ballot requests from travelers and college students.
To register, Massachusetts residents who are also US citizens and at least 18 years old can mail in their voter registration form to their local election officials as long as it is postmarked by Wednesday.
The voter registration form is available online to print out in English, Spanish, and Chinese. Residents can also register to vote in person at any election office or registration event within the state, or obtain a form while renewing or applying for a driver’s license.
Those who have moved in the past six months or have not voted for an extended period must reregister in order to vote in November, said Secretary of State William F. Galvin.
“Our first task is to make sure everyone who is entitled to vote can register,” Galvin said. “If you have any doubt, call your local office to verify voter status.”Sarah N. Mattero can be reached at sarah.mattero@

This one is going straight into my keeper file! Very, very good. I also threw in cubed eggplant and roasted the veggies in the oven at 425 for about 40 minutes. If you oven roast, use two large pans or trays so veggies won't be crowded. Can't wait to try this on the grill. If you haven't tried white balsamic vinegar, go ahead and splurge on some. It's milder than the dark balsamic and very versatile.
Great salad - I served it over a bed of arugula. I thought I had white balsamic, but we were out, so I used regular. It was delicious; the taste definitely didn't suffer from using the dark balsamic (I think it actually gave it a richer better flavor).
I ended up roasting my veggies instead of grilling because I couldn't find my grill pan. I adore roasted veggies, though, and loved them done this way. I thought the dressing was good but found I would have preferred to eat the veggies without it. Made for ZWT8 France. Merci!

Question from 2.17.07 WebEx Review: If mom is more than 6 months postpartum and is no longer breastfeeding, should she receive a last set of benefits before being terminated for Categorical Ineligibility? If so, do those benefits need to be issued before changes are made to the infant’s Health Information screen?
Answer: According to MOM 5.2-3, under Certification Periods: For a BF Woman, "If her infant is six (6) months or older, she is given 15 days notification of pending ineligibility. If she is due to receive vouchers within the 15 days, CPAs may issue one-month’s vouchers."
As explained on pages 33-34 of the 2.17.07 Release Document, after Release 2.17.07 is implemented, the system will auto-terminate mom if her infant is more than 6 months old and she is no longer breastfeeding (the checkmark is removed from the Breastfeeding Now checkbox in the infant's Health Information screen).
The following steps should be taken in order to insure mom receives her last set of benefits and policy guidelines are met:
- Issue Benefits to Mom:
1. Open mom's Participant Folder
2. Issue one last set of benefits to mom for her current food package (remove the checkmarks from all but the first set auto-suggested and, to keep it simple, from any other household members being suggested at this time)
3. Once the set of benefits is issued, close mom's Participant Folder (it must be closed for the system to auto-terminate)
- Change Infant’s Breastfeeding Status, Auto-Terminate Mom’s Cert, and Issue Benefits to Infant:
4. Open the infant's Participant Folder
5. Click on the Health Information tab
6. Click on the Breastfeeding Now checkbox to remove the checkmark
7. Click Yes on the message indicating mom's cert will be terminated
8. Click on another tab and save the changes to Health Information
9. The Select Formula screen opens; complete it
10. Issue benefits to the infant and other members of the household
- Issue Ineligibility Letter to Mom:
11. Open mom's Participant Folder again
12. Click on Participant Activities on the menu bar
13. Select Generate Official Notification
This is specific to a breastfeeding woman who has an infant more than 6 months old and has completely stopped breastfeeding. As long as she is breastfeeding at least one time per day, she should continue as a Some-BF woman.

Deutsche Telekom, the German parent of the only major U.S. wireless carrier not to offer the iPhone, says it has a deal to begin selling Apple devices in the U.S. in 2013.
The news came with little fanfare, buried halfway through a news release on capital expenditure plans for the coming year, and occupied a single line: "T-Mobile USA has entered into an agreement with Apple to bring products to market together in 2013."
Precisely what Apple devices might go on sale isn't spelled out, but Apple offers just two that run on cellular networks: the iPhone and iPad.
The deal comes as T-Mobile is preparing to launch a wireless network based on the high-speed LTE technology in 2013. Its current network is based on the slower HSPA+ standard.
T-Mobile USA has lost out on the iPhone, which continues to be the most popular handset in the U.S. It has attempted to court subscribers of rival AT&T with lower rates, but the impact of such a promotion could never match selling the phone itself.
Deutsche Telekom said it plans to spend.
A spokesman for T-Mobile USA declined to offer any additional information on deal.

While the backward compatibility offering may not be ready on release day, the unit will be able to play downloaded PSP titles that users already own. This news is actually a bit of a surprise, considering that the last time Sony did backward compatibility (as on the PS3) they ended up tossing it out.
From what we understand, the backward compatibility is really nothing more than downloading a new NGP version of the game. The NGP updated versions will offer some additional support, such as support for the second analog stick, for example.
Rumors of cross platform play continue, but we will see how that evolves the closer we get to the actual E3 announcement. According to the whispers that we have heard, Sony plans to launch the NGP in at least one region during the holiday season. If not by the holiday season, it will be by the end of the year, for sure. It is likely that the NGP will not arrive in the U.S. until at least next year.

The 37-year-old Beckham, who had been without a club ever since leaving LA Galaxy after winning his second straight MLS Cup back in December, travelled to Paris on Thursday to complete the deal. He has signed a five-month contract until the end of the season after passing his medical. Beckham confirmed in a press conference in Paris that he would not be receiving a salary, and instead his wages would be donated to a children's charity.
"David turned down offers from all over the world, so we're happy to have him here," PSG president Nasser Al-Khelaifi said in front of assembled reporters. ," Beckham said. "I got a lot of offers, more than I've had in my career. I chose Paris Saint-Germain, because I can see what the club are trying to do. I can see the players the clubs are bringing in."
Beckham is PSG's second signing of the transfer window after the previous arrival of Lucas Moura from Sao Paulo, a deal that had already been agreed at the start of the 2012-13 campaign.Calendar Of Events Health

Although Kristel stopped playing Emmanuelle (for a time) after just three films, the character continued in other forms, most famously in the persona of exotically beautiful Indonesian Laura Gemser, who starred in an imitation Italian-produced series generally known as "Black Emanuelle" (note the single m). Black Emanuelle (Emanuelle near, 1975) was the first, and Gemser went on to play the character in eight more films, while in at least another four her character's names were misleadingly changed to Emanuelle when they were dubbed into English.
Emanuelle Around the World was the fifth "Black Emanuelle" movie, and one of five directed and co-written by the infamous Joe D'Amato. Born Aristide Massaccesi, D'Amato had rather peculiar notions of eroticism, frequently adding graphic horror elements to the mix, most famously in the appalling Emanuelle and the Last Cannibals (Emanuelle e gli ultimi cannibali , 1977). Emanuelle Around the World is similarly contradictory, with Emanuelle (Gemser) a photojournalist on a crusade against the exploitation and humiliation of women in a film that outrageously exploits and humiliates women during the course of its 102-minute running time.
Where the French Emmanuelle movies were generally about one woman's sexual liberation, and the lovemaking on a mutually consensual basis, scenes of Emanuelle Around the World's heroine enjoying sex whenever, wherever, and with whomever she pleases shares screentime with multiple gang rapes and, among other things, forced sex acts with various animals. D'Amato clearly intends for male audiences to find such violent and disturbing scenes titillating, but instead such footage is merely execrable.
Except for its most brutal vignettes, by today's blunt hard-core standards, Emanuelle Around the World (original title: Emanuelle - perché violenza alle donne?, or "Emanuelle - Why Violence Against Womankind?") is almost tame. Severin Film's all-region DVD offers the "XXX European Version," but in fact there's probably less than 15 minutes of anything like hard-core sex. Intercourse scenes with Gamser are simulated, though other scenes involving lesser players and extras clearly are not.
The story has globe-trotting Emanuelle on the trail of a white slave ring with similarly beautiful reporter Cora Norman (Karin Schubert). Her research does indeed take her around the world: the film was shot in both New York and San Francisco, in India, Italy, Hong Kong, and Iran, and the locations, both exteriors and interiors, are well-chosen.
The film's script, however, is not one of its greater assets, mainly because Emanuelle's battle against men who sexually abuse women is so patently phony and insincere. (Mild Spoiler: The film ends with Emanuelle, having blown the lid off the white slave trade and the scandal "spreading like an oil spot," is last seen aboard a yacht sailing past the Statue of Liberty, with by sheer chance a huge industrial fire in the background, an oddly apropos image given its big gang rape-by-U.S. Senators finale.)
Video & Audio
Emanuelle Around the World is given a fine 16:9 widescreen transfer at 1.77:1, approximating the film's original 1.85:1 release. The transfer uses French title elements, where it was called Le Vice dans La Peau, or "The Vice in the Skin," and apparently exhibited at 1.66:1, at least based on the title graphics. The titles are on the soft side, but the rest of the film looks great. The English mono is okay, but the Italian mono track (with optional English subtitles) is superior. There are no Extra Features
Parting Thoughts
Emanuelle Around the World is recommended for those curious about '70s era erotic cinema and for fans of actress Gemser, whose beauty far eclipses everything else about the film. All others are duly warned.

Richard A. Whitt was named the recipient of the 2014 Theodore Roosevelt Association Police Award for his ability to overcome injury and continue to render outstanding service to Dallas police during a June 9 ceremony at Dallas police headquarters.
Whitt, a 1991 Bendle High School graduate and former officer with Genesee Township and Flint police, was honored after he was shot multiple times by a sniper, but was able to recover and become a leader in Dallas police's Fusion Center -- an intelligence-gathering operation that works to support officers in the field.
"It's hard to put into words," Whitt said of the award. "It's good that the Theodore Roosevelt Association reaches out to officers that have been in a major incident."
Whitt was injured shortly after 9 p.m. Nov. 28, 2010, after a man opened fire on his ex-girlfriend's apartment with an assault rifle, according to a memo nominating Whitt for the award.
Officers arrived at the apartment complex and made contact with the shooting victim and were told by several witnesses that the shooter had fled the scene. The shooter did flee the scene on foot, but it was later learned that he had run to his nearby pickup truck, where he was able to reload his rifle.
The suspect returned to the apartment complex and took up a sniper's position under an unlit set of stairs west of where officers were investigating the first shooting, according to the memo.
Whitt and another officer arrived to work with a crowd of spectators, but they unknowingly stopped their vehicle directly in front of the suspect's concealed sniper position.
The suspect opened fire on the officers as soon as they exited their vehicle.
Three rounds went through the cruiser's door and struck Whitt: two in the upper left leg and another in the left calf.
Officers from the original scene responded and covered Whitt, who was bleeding profusely from the attack. Officers were able to get Whitt into the rear of the damaged police cruiser and begin first aid until they were able to load him into an ambulance and transport him to a hospital.
Whitt underwent multiple surgeries following the attack and months of physical therapy. He was able to return to work on a temporary basis April 11, 2011 -- 134 days after the attack.
"It was a pretty intense night," Whitt said. "I've always been positive about it."
Whitt said he requested an assignment with the department's Fusion Center, which is a tactical response unit that assists officers in the field and gathers information that could help them better respond to situations.
He was instrumental in creating a geo-coded database of the city's apartments to assist officers in locating a single apartment in Dallas' sprawling complexes. He is also considered an expert in the sovereign citizen movement and home-grown extremist groups.
"Officer Whitt has never shied away from an assignment and more times than not, will be the first to volunteer for any task," his nomination reads. "Other officers in the unit continually seek him out as a source of knowledge and expertise."
Whitt said the support of his family and friends, including officers that he worked with in Michigan, helped him recover from the attack and get back to work.
"I just wish I could thank everybody that called and sent cards and letters to me, and thank them for all the support they gave me through the whole deal," Whitt said. "It's nice to know people actually do these types of things for each other anymore."
Below is a video produced by Dallas police that includes video of the shooting scene and an interview with Whitt:On Mon, 2006-10-09 at 13:22 -0600, Doran L.

A recent survey conducted by a local Chinese-language magazine shows that only 23 percent of high-ranking executives in local companies are women, even if their education levels are now higher than their male counterparts'.
Not surprisingly, caring for children or elderly family members remains the main responsibility of women in 74 percent of households. They also do all the housework in more than 60 percent of cases. Even among double-income families, data show that men share housework with women in just 10 percent of couples.
Another survey by the Ministry of Labor also indicates that women are paid 16.1 percent less on average than men in Taiwan. This means that women need to work 59 days more than men per year to earn the same level of income. It is clear that the heavy burden of housework and unfair treatment in the workplace have combined to suppress the creativity of many women.
According to the Gender Equality in Employment Act of 2007, female employees in Taiwan may apply for parental leave with up to 60 percent of their salary for six months. Yet, complementary measures still haven't been implemented and most women are afraid of losing their jobs when returning to work. Taiwan should be inspired to follow the example of states like Finland, Norway and Sweden, which place a high priority on family-friendly policies. Norway, for example, provides a combination of 12 months' paid parental leave with universal access to childcare at highly subsidized rates.
The unexpected pregnancy of teenagers is another growing issue in Taiwan. Problems related to teen pregnancy such as abortion, unemployment and lack of adequate finances, not only harm young women but also their children. Teen mothers are more likely to be isolated from friends and to even stop pursuing higher education. Taiwan health authorities should know that proper sex education in the Netherlands has successfully reduced the rate of teen pregnancy. According to a study dating from 2011, there are only 1.67 teenage pregnancies out of a thousand Dutch girls (15-19 years old), while the birth rate among Taiwanese teen moms is about 3.68 percent.FIFA barrs Iranian Women Soccer Team from Competing in the First Youth Olymic games in Singapore.

Taxonomy
Description & Behavior
Southern bluefin tuna, Thunnus maccoyii (Castelnau, 1872), are a very large species commonly caught by Indonesian and Japanese commercial long-liners in the Indian Ocean, their spawning ground. If a southern bluefin tuna reaches adulthood (when they are about 12 years old) before they're caught, they can grow up to 2.45 m and weigh up to 260 kg. These fish have swim bladders and are silvery white in color on their lower (ventral) side. Their first dorsal fin is either yellow or blue and their anal fin and finlets are dusky yellow-edged with black. Their median caudal keel is yellow in adults. They are marked with colorless transverse lines and rows of colorless dots. Southern bluefin tunas are a large pelagic species that lives between 20 and 40 years of age.
World Range & Habitat
Thunnus maccoyii can be found in the Atlantic, Indian and Pacific Oceans in both temperate and cold seas, primarily between 10°S and 50°S, to nearly 60°S. They are pelagic (open water) with a depth range between 0-50 m. They prefer to inhabit temperate waters that are between 5-20°C.
Feeding Behavior (Ecology)
Southern bluefin tuna, Thunnus maccoyii, are opportunistic feeders that prey on a wide variety of fishes, crustaceans, cephalopods, salps and other marine animals.
Life History
Thunnus maccoyii are often caught near their spawning grounds in the Indian Ocean. During spawning, the adult fish migrate to tropical seas, off the west coast of Australia, up to 10°S. Spawning fish and larvae can be found in waters with surface temperatures between 20-30°C. They have a minimum population doubling time of 4.5 - 14 years, making the southern bluefin tuna a prime target for overfishing.
Conservation Status & Comments
Southern bluefin tuna are a highly migratory species. If the current exploitation continues, the population will be below 500 mature individuals within the next century, which is a number far too low to be sustainable.
Southern bluefin tuna, Thunnus maccoyii, are listed as Critically Endangered A2bd on the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species:
CRITICALLY ENDANGERED (CR)
A taxon is Critically Endangered when it is facing an extremely high risk of extinction in the wild in the immediate future, as defined by any of the criteria (A to E) as described here.

Mutharika addressing a Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) rally in Malawi’s capital, Lilongwe sharply objected to rights activists calls to respect minority rights including that of gays and lesbians in the fight for HIV/Aids.
He adopted Zimbabwean President Robert Mugabe’s stance against homosexuals saying they area worse than dogs.
“You will never see dogs marry each other,” Mutharika told thousands of his supporters in remarks broadcast like on state radio MBC.
“These people want us to behave worse than dogs. I cannot allow it,” he said.
Muthaeika said the sanctity of a family revolved around a father, a mother and children
Government has been accusing human rights groups campaigning for minority rights of being funded by foreign interests.
Last year, the Malawi’ s first openly gay couple was convicted of practicing homosexuality and sentenced to the maximum 14 years in jail. The president pardoned the couple following international pressure.—(Reporting by Judith Moyo, Nyasa Times)MEMORANDUM 2007-36
November 26, 2007
TO THE HEADS OF ALL STATE AGENCIES
I. INTRODUCTION
This Memorandum updates and replaces Comptroller's Memorandum 2006-36 dated November 29, 2006.
The Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement, and Modernization Act of 2003 (MMA) added a prescription drug program to Medicare, referred to as "Part D" of Medicare. Prescription drug coverage under Medicare was available January 1, 2006. This program requires that the State, as an entity that provides prescription drug coverage to Medicare beneficiaries, must disclose whether the entity's coverage is "creditable prescription drug coverage" (Disclosure Notice). The disclosure is required whether the entity's coverage is primary or secondary to Medicare. The Creditable Coverage Disclosure Notice (hereinafter the "Notice") must be provided to all Part D eligible individuals who are covered under, or who apply for, the State's prescription drug coverage. The Notice requirement applies with respect to Medicare beneficiaries who are active employees and those who are retired, as well as to Medicare beneficiaries who are covered as spouses under active or retiree coverage.
The prescription drug benefits of the State employee and retiree health plan qualify as creditable coverage, meaning that the benefits provided are at least as valuable as the benefits provided under Medicare Part D.
The Retirement and Benefits Services Division mailed the Notice to retired employees and beneficiaries with the 2007 Open Enrollment materials, and will provide such Notices to Retirees in the future. The Division has also mailed the Notice to all active employees and their spouses who are, or will be, age 65 on or before January 1, 2009.
In that connection, the purpose of this Memorandum is to remind state agencies of the procedures that have been implemented to assure that all Medicare eligible employees and their dependents are provided the Notice as required by federal law, and the tasks that must be performed at the Agency level to identify those eligible for such Notice.
II. NOTICE PROCEDURES - The Division will continue to provide Notices to retired beneficiaries. Agencies should refer all questions from retired employees or their dependents to the Retirement Health Insurance Unit at (860) 702 3533.
The Division will continue to provide the annual Notice to all employees and their enrolled beneficiaries who are identified as Medicare-eligible and are enrolled in active employee health coverage.
A. Recordkeeping - In order to assure compliance with federal regulations that require employers to provide the Notice at certain times as outlined in B. below, the following information must be obtained from all Medicare beneficiaries prior to the issuance of the Notice in B. below:
The information must be entered into the CORE-CT Personal Information page for employees (Workforce Administration > Personal Information > Modify a Person, select the Regional tab), or on the Update Dependent\Beneficiary page (Benefits > Employee/Dependent Information > Update Dependent/Beneficiary, select the Personal Profile tab, then click on the US Flag - US Federal Government drop down), for dependent\beneficiaries. A Job Aid will be issued on this subject in the near future.
B. Notice is also required at certain other times, and must be provided by the employing Agency as follows:
C. Use the form letter EE_0708_Creditable Coverage Notice_form.doc (enclosed) in the above situations. Do not use earlier versions of the Notice. Complete all fields in the form letter, and a place a copy of the Notice in the employee's personnel file used for benefit purposes. The text of this letter cannot be changed by the Agency.
D. If an employee or beneficiary is losing state employee coverage, and requests a personalized Notice, please contact the number below and request that a personalized Notice be sent.
III. QUESTIONS
Inquiries from employees who have questions about Medicare D that are not answered in the Creditable Coverage Notice should be referred to Medicare. Inquiries from retired employees should be referred to the Retirement Health Insurance Unit at 702-3533. Personnel or Payroll staff who have questions concerning the Medicare D Creditable Coverage Notice should contact the Comptroller's Retirement & Benefit Services Division, Health Care Analysis Unit at (860) 702-3539.
Very truly yours,
Nancy Wyman

Return to Comptroller's Home PageJust about now, we should be reading the first stories on the sales of the new GMT900 trucks.
That is the designation for the General Motors truck platform replacing the GMT800, starting now. The vehicles built off this platform include the Chevy Silverado and GMC Sierra fullsize pickups; Chevy Avalanche, Suburban, Tahoe; GMC Denali, Yukon and Cadillac Escalade SUVs – even the Hummer H2. They are being phased into production now, SUVs first.
Watch for words like "disappointing." You will read the new GMT900 may not be able to save GM. But don't worry.
The new SUVs and the pickups that follow in another year will do just fine. They are much improved, with better fuel economy, handling, fit and finish. But too much is being expected of them.
They won't single-handedly save GM. Sales won't match the volumes of a few years ago, when they soared to more than 1.5 million just in the U.S. I doubt 2006 sales will be able to equal last year's 1.4 million units, and they could drop again in 2007.
The old GMT800 did save GM – absolutely. It's possible the auto maker would be out of business now but for that platform. Look at total North America production, according to Ward's data:
- 2005: 1,491,084
- 2004: 1,704,239
- 2003:Â 1,810,340
- 2002:Â 1,672,804
- 2001: 1,569,198
Those volumes are incredible.Â At 1.8 million, with a $5,000 pre-tax profit per vehicle (my estimate) that is a $9 billion profit! If GM had another platform that profitable, there wouldnâ€™t be any speculation about bankruptcy.
If it had two more platforms like the GMT800, Democrats would be demanding we break up GM.
What happened to the money? GM lost it everywhere else in North America, but that platform still saved the company.
Unfortunately the market growth isn't in big, body-on-frame vehicles anymore.Â Fuel prices are playing a role in the decline, but more likely they have just run their course.
The growth is in smaller models and cross/utility vehicles. There's much more competition, too. Nissan is selling 85,000 big Titan pickups a year and not just to folks who never before owned a pickup. Some conquests are from GM.
When Toyota cranks up its new Texas fullsize pickup plant, some of those sales will come out of GM's hide, too. The new Mercedes R-Class and GL-Class CUVs swill grab some customers that might have bought Cadillac Escalades.
With the market shift and new competition, profits slide. Prices get chopped, or dollars are put on the hood. That's just the way it is.
GMT900 still will be the highest-volume platform at GM; it just won't come close to past years' volumes.
Over time, the new trucks should help stabilize GM's falling market share and transaction prices. But GM's new cars and CUVs have to come on real strong behind these big boys.
If the present management can't show signs of a turnaround soon, expect a change by fall.

Energy and Water Management
POC: Matthew Rothgeb, NASA TEERM Principal Center (321-867-8476)
The goal of the Energy and Water Management Program associated with the Technology Evaluation for Environmental Risk Mitigation Principal Center (TEERM) is to assist NASA efficiently manage, and accurately report energy and water data to effectively reduce utility consumption and increase renewable energy use in accordance with federal regulatory requirements. Rising utility costs, stringent regulatory requirements, and inefficient facility operation and maintenance pose a risk to NASA's mission. The Energy and Water Management Program aids in monitoring, analyzing, and reporting utility data , and promotes efficient usage of NASA resources to reduce mission risk and ensure compliance.

NASA spent $125.52M on facility energy in Fiscal Year (FY) 2014. Although that represents less than one percent of NASA's overall annual budget, the upward trend in energy costs concerns the Agency. To date, NASA has reduced energy consumption by 28.55%, while energy unit costs have increased by 60.0%. The increasing energy unit costs offset energy conservation, which results in NASA using less but spending more.
The National Energy Conservation Policy Act (NECPA), as amended by the Energy Policy Act of 2005 (EPAct 2005), and the Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007 (EISA 2007), mandates energy and water conservation goals for all federal agencies, including NASA. In addition to the requirements set forth in NECPA, federal agencies must also meet the requirements of Executive Order (EO) 13423, (January 2007) and EO 13514 (October 2009). There are also reporting requirements associated with these regulatory requirements. The Presidential Memorandum of Federal Leadership on Energy Management released on December 5, 2013 updated various existing requirements. NASA Headquarters Environmental Management Division (HQ EMD) created the Energy and Water Management Program to support NASA in achieving these regulatory requirements.
With assistance from TEERM, HQ EMD has compiled and submitted the NASA Annual Report to the Department of Energy (DOE) every year since FY 2007. The reports contain information on how NASA is meeting federally mandated energy and water management goals. TEERM monitors input for timeliness, anomalies, and conformity to the new energy and water reporting guidelines and compiles the information into the final report. Additionally, TEERM has worked with HQ EMD to develop Center and Agency dashboards to show at a glance quarterly progress toward federal energy and water goals. These charts will continue to be updated in FY 2014 and beyond. TEERM is also working with the NASA Environmental Tracking System (NETS) to create a web-based version of these charts. TEERM has also adapted these charts and tables to assist HQ EMD with Baseline Performance Reviews (BPRs).

TEERM recently supported the annual NASA Energy Efficiency Panel (EEP) face-to-face meeting, hosted by the National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) in Golden, Colorado. The three day workshop (August 25–27) consisted of two days of NREL/NASA-provided training and a one day EEP meeting. Training sessions included Utility Energy Service Contracts (UESC) strategies, renewable energy procurement and project opportunity screening, energy security and resiliency, combined heat and power (CHP), net zero building projects, microgrids, energy storage, various NREL software tools, and energy management control systems (EMCS). The EEP face-to-face meeting allows NASA Center Energy Managers and other EEP members to discuss topics relevant to agency strategy, including federal reporting requirements, agency procedural guidance, funding, and lessons learned.
TEERM is also supporting the Hydrogen and Fuel Cells Interagency Working Group (IWG). Established shortly after former President George W. Bush announced the Hydrogen Fuel Initiative in 2003, this IWG serves as the mechanism for collaboration among the federal agencies involved in hydrogen-related research, development, and demonstration. TEERM developed a matrix showing all Hydrogen and Fuel Cell activities from the various NASA Centers to be included in the Group’s extensive hydrogen research taxonomy of past, present, and future hydrogen activities of the Federal government. TEERM redesigned NASA’s Hydrogen website to include Fuel Cells and provides regular updates to showcase NASA’s activity in these areas. Visit NASA’s Hydrogen Web site.
The Energy and Water Management Program assists NASA HQ with Environmental and Energy Functional Reviews at NASA Centers. Engineers work with HQ EMD personnel to interview Center management and assess site progress toward federal requirements as well as address areas where HQ can further assist Centers. Each NASA site is visited in a three-year cycle for this internal review.
NASA TEERM is responsible for organizing and facilitating the NASA Energy Innovation Working Group (EIWG), a multi-Center collaborative effort initiated by the Agency Energy Coordinator. The EIWG was formed to collaborate on ideas to move the energy reduction significantly at the agency level and is tasked with and is tasked with addressing energy security risk reduction for NASA critical infrastructure and achieving NASA facility energy efficiency mandates. The EIWG membership includes civil servants from Glenn Research Center (GRC), Jet Propulsion Lab (JPL), Johnson Space Center (JSC), Kennedy Space Center (KSC), and HQ.

We stay only for two nights, and didn't meet Zvonimira but everything was perfect. Great location, in center and right to the sea. Place was clean and comfortable.
Just perfect!
+ Great location with view on the sea. Possibility to park our car on the private car park of Zvonimira. Easy check-in/check-out
- Wireless didn't work properly in the apartment #2. Not enough cutlery for 2 people.
The apartment was great, as advertised. Clean, comfy, plenty of space, parking was easy, etc. The location was fantastic and right on the main water front and commercial drag by the Old Town. Walking distance to almost everything in the tourist areas. Sibenik was way better than we expected. It was smaller and much quieter than Dubrovnik (no cruise ships emptying thousands of camera toting tourists into Old Town) and it had a better feel than Split. We visited in November, so it was pretty quiet. That being said, the space really is right above some fun clubs and bars, but the bands playing can be heard clearly from the window, and a few of them could sorely use some drum lessons! A plus for some, a minus for others. By closing the window much of the noise was gone, and it was nothing a few earplugs couldn't solve. If you've ever lived in a major city this will seem like nothing, and we stayed on a Saturday night. Also the apartment is right above a nice little cafe so we found ourselves having a beer right there instead of going too far from home. I would also add this - we were pretty positively surprised by the food options in Sibenik. We ate better meals than Dubrovnik at half the cost. We even listened to the Cathedral choir practicing at dinner one evening, voices echoing off the stone walls of the city. Not something we got anywhere else in Croatia. The hosts were prompt to respond to our requests and gave us some good advice about things to do. Really a positive experience, and we would look it up again if we ever come back.

-very comfortable to wear all day
-very long reach for the cord and the volume adjustment was great
Cons: -mic failed in FIRST day. people on ventrillo heard a pop like it was being unplugged and could not to get to work again. yet i plugged in my old headset and everything worked great. I would NOT recommend people buy this product. I've never had an audio system or speaker die in the first day of use ever.
Other Thoughts: While it lasted it seemed like a worth while product and was easily one of the most comfortable of lower end headsets i've used.READ FULL REVIEW

This review is from: SAPPHIRE 100275L Radeon X1650PRO 512MB 128-Bit GDDR2 AGP 4X/8X Video Card
Pros: Worked great for the few hours i had it befor RMA.
Played COD4 on near highest settings @ 1024x768. i had artifacting on the large field maps as soon as they loaded, but worked otherwise.
Cons: As great as the card was, i bought it for the full heat sink fan, which in the newegg pic covers the ram chips as well. But the picture is of an older revision. instead it came with a small square blue heat sink fan, much like the other version newegg sells. Not a big deal, but i RMA'ed the card. new egg was exceptional for the service.
Other Thoughts: Using a low end system but the card defently worked well:

I love that I have the experience from running our shop, and seeing what successful shops do to be able to help others. I’m thinking of getting my portfolio together and opening a website just for freelance work. More on that to come…
We bought our forever home. Well, I think it’s our forever home. I love my community, and we’re really close to the lake. It’s a gorgeous home with more than enough room for all our hobbies. Mike wishes the garage was bigger… but to make him content we would have had to buy a house with a 4 bay garage. Speaking of hobbies…
We bought and assembled a 3d printer! So far we’re printing things for the kids and I for around the house, and Mike is printing things to make the machines at work run better. I’ll post more about that later, with pictures!
And finally I have some designs that I’m working on for the shop. Keep an eye out in the next week or two!
So now that I’ve caught you up, how are all of my friends doing?
Leave me a comment and let me wracking. I’m going to have to compile all the artwork I’ve done so far. I’m hoping I have enough solid work to create a good portfolio. Time will tell!
And how did my year go? So glad you asked! I’m very proud of myself. I know I’ve let my Etsy shop go a bit and haven’t written on the blog or done any shows or kept in contact on Facebook, but it’s all paid off. My first semester I managed a 3.4 GPA. That’s impressive for me, especially because I am raising 3 girls and Mike travels so much! If it wasn’t for my mom moving out here to help I’d be lost. Last month he was home one week, gone the other three. It was amazing to me when I got an invitation to apply to Mortar Board, senior national honors society. They choose 100 people from campus with a high GPA and ask them to submit an application. I didn’t actually expect to get in. I was a horrible student in high school. I did my best when I was in college the first time around, but honestly it was all just a blur because I was trying to figure out how to be a young single mom. I was accepted, along with 12 other females. They explained that they upped the requirements this year, so I was that much more flattered and excited! It was the icing on this past year. It’s been a long year, but I’m so proud of myself for finally doing something I thought I’d never have the courage to do. any. He’s in the beginning stages of figuring it all out now. Which college, who offers online courses, what are his requirements as a transfer student. Fun, fun, fun. He’ll still have to work full time, but we think work will be a little flexible as long as he doesn’t slack there. He’ll be a part time student, and work full time, along with being a great dad & husband. Yep… he’s that awesome!
An update on my college stuff? Oh, just the exciting stuff. TB test. Paperwork. I can’t wait until the classes actually start (remind me I said that in December). I’m getting further along on my portfolio for my scholarship. I’ve done a few pencil drawings & some photography. I really need to be better about remembering the camera when we go out. I could have gotten some beautiful shots around the UW campus & the capitol building. I’ll just have to remember it on our girl’s weekend out there at the end of July! Going to with my buddy FudgiePickles to spend the night in Madison, then going to Summer Craftacular Sunday morning (as a customer this time). We’re going to hopefully get to spend some time with PangeaHandmade, maybe help her set up for the show. And JennasAttic if she’s not working her buns off! Going to be fabulous!!!
Here’s a photograph of a barn we pass by when we head to the next town. I absolutely love the old door! “Eat ice cream for daily happiness”… AMEN! Mike literally whipped the car to the side of the road for me to get a quick photo… he’s a nut like that :)
Now go eat ice cream!!!
Have a safe & happy 4th. Enjoy friends & family & the old place took up our time… cleaning & mowing & just general living in a humongous home! It’s been a welcome relief to only have one bathtub to clean. Our yard takes about 20 minutes to mow. We’ll miss the quiet & being far away from the road and cars, but we have the most wonderful neighbors. It seems like with every sad thing we think of there’s a happy thing right behind it.
Window over the built-in’s.
Old door hardware. Love <3
So what have we been up to? Mike’s had to fill his time with a new project… a motorcycle! He bought a 79′ Suzuki for a few hundred dollars to fix up. I won’t tell you how much has gone into it, but Mike is going to know the bike inside & out! It is turning out to be a pretty nice project.
The carbs need to be put in… waiting on parts.
Our thoughts are always with our new studio. We went from having a gas kiln & wood kiln to needing an electric kiln to get back to production. Here in town an electric kiln is going to be the way to go. We might actually have a lead on a kiln. We’re hoping the price is reasonable. We will see! We are selling our stock in the meantime to help with kiln costs.
I think the kids like the new place…
I also have some exciting news… I’m going back to college! So far I have an Associates in Early Childhood Education. I really wish someone had told me then that I would make less being a preschool teacher than if I worked at McDonalds. Oh, well. That degree did give me credits toward my next adventure. I’m going back for graphic design. I think I’m equally nervous & excited. I’ll {hopefully} be applying what I learn to the blog as I go, so look for some new exciting updates this fall! As for me going to a 4 year school, refer back to our shop to support my crazy adventure. I have a feeling I’ll need to upgrade my laptop soon ;) bus & living closer to school. The hour that it took to get home will be well spent snacking & having extra cuddle time. It’s all so bittersweet. I’ll miss my morning coffee with the sun shining in on me from our big windows.
In the spirit of making every day count we decided in all the insanity we’d do one last wood firing. It’ll be a long time before we get the opportunity again. Mike has thrown some great pieces. Hopefully this firing will be just as good, or better than the last. I think I’ll post some video of this one. I’ll definitely get some of us unloading it.
Until then… We’ll be having a sale in the shop! Check it out, and don’t forget to use the coupon code! (check the shop banner for the current sale). We’re trying to get rid of stock & get enough money scraped together for an electric kiln that we can use to start our business again somewhere else. We thank everyone who has supported us so far! We appreciate it more than you know. as if we’ll have that accomplished in time to buy a home. So, rentals here we come. Again. We’re trying to make the best of it. But as it’s probably pretty apparent with my lack of posts I’ve become a tad depressed. I’m hoping once we’re settled in wherever we’re going to be I’ll get a little energy back. Until then I’ll be trying to post some more & keep my spirits up. I have a feeling in the end things will work out the best for everyone! 2012 may not be our year for our business, but our family is going to be very well taken care of and happy!
(Sorry no pictures this time… next time I promise!) had very little space. All my craft supplies lived in a small Harry Potter closet (the coolest thing about the whole place) under the stairs. It was a nightmare to try to get in and out of with supplies. I had to set up on the kitchen table & clear it off as soon as I was interrupted. It wasn’t all horrible, but it’s much nicer to have a studio with a dedicated space.
We had a miracle drop in our laps. A coworker of Mike’s was moving to Spain and was willing to rent to us our dream house. A four bedroom, three bathroom house on 7 acres of land with a pottery studio all ready on site. The owner used to be a potter but had to quit after it bothered his back too much. The plan was to build the pottery back up, pay down our debts, and buy the house. We were being very optimistic. Very.
Mike was happy to have a studio again. It had been years since he was able work on his pottery. We had a small studio back in NY. Here we have a nice big studio with two wheels, a wood kiln, a small electric kiln, and we’ve built a gas kiln. With Mike working full time, and having three girls to look after it’s been challenging to get the studio time we need to produce efficiently.
I’ve learned so much in the past two years. I’ve gotten better at photographing our work. Mike and I are getting better at working together well. We have started to branch out doing craft shows. We are finally getting a good following and some great products. We are selling at a gallery and doing very well.
Unfortunately it’s not enough to have great product. I know we still have a long long way to go. We need to polish our image, story, and get the word out there on blogs and articles.
Here comes the really depressing part… the owners are visiting this October to clean out the rest of their things to sell the house. We didn’t anticipate how much extra costs would be. We are paying a lot more for heating, paying for snow plowing to get out of our driveway in the winter, and just general upkeep. Every time we think we’re having a good month something unexpected comes up. There is no way we could ever afford it realistically. We have already cut every possible corner.
We aren’t going to give up. We are going to look for a home that’s more affordable with space to (hopefully) build up the pottery again. It will take time though. In the meantime we will continue to list what we have in stock & I’ll keep making and listing journals. Our dream is changing a bit, but we’ll never give up on it.
An extra special huge thank you to our customers who have made it possible for us to live our dream so far. We appreciate you more than you know!Bourbaki is far from being dead (the story mentioned in FOM was a "canular", a well-organised joke of many years ago): a book has been published not long ago Bourbaki, N. Elements de mathematique : Algebre commutative. Chap. 5 : entiers. Chap. 6 : valuations. Chap. 7 : diviseurs / Paris : Masson, 1985. - 351 p.; there is a regular Seminaire Bourbaki at ENS, which produces, every few months, a thick volume of mathematically very high standard proceedings (see Seminaire Bourbaki at); more books are in a (slow) pipeline for production; the "Association Bourbaki" has an office at ENS, and a (part time) secretary (Mme Le Dret ext. 2088, Ulm 45 RC J5 BOURBAKI ). The formal members form a "secret" group; but they must "retire" at the age of 50, then they can speak loud. I often discussed with Pierre Cartier, who is very open-minded, and I have an ongoing, so far informal, collaboration with a recently "retired" one (a leading geometer - working in singularities, at ENS): he surely has "foundational" interest and most of todays' Bourbaki's people, he tells me, do not like Dieudonne''s way of presenting matters. (We both naively like to stress a structural-geometric side in mathematics, besides the formal-linguistic one, probably under the influence of some aspects of Bourbaki's). Surely, Bourbaki today never or rarely discusses foundation. Yet, as I am an (applied) logician, when I eat at the "cantine" of ENS , where Dieudonne' spirit is still wandering around, I wait for my neighbour to eat first .... just to check for poison.

Algeria election defeat stuns Islamists
Algerian election defeat stun Islamists
This week’s election in Algeria did not lead to the victory expected by the country’s Islamist parties.
Islamist parties in Algeria failed to wrest control away from the ruling majority in the country’s May 10th legislative elections. As a result, Algeria stands as an exception to the “green wave” that brought Islamist parties to power in Tunisia, Morocco and beyond.
According to the initial results that emerged on Friday (May 11th), the National Liberation Front (FLN) nearly won an outright majority with 220 seats. Collectively, Islamist parties could do no better than 59 seats.
“The people voted to punish the FLN in 1992 by shunning it in favour of the Islamic Salvation Front (FIS),” said Interior Minister Dahou Ould Kablia on Saturday. “This time around, the people voted to escape from the dangers to national stability.”
Abdelaziz Belkhadem, general secretary of the FLN, expressed delight at the victory. “The party will forge alliances in Parliament,” he said, in order to prevent a return to a one-party system.
Reactions from the Islamist parties, who long projected their victory, were not so optimistic.
The Green Algeria Alliance called the election results “manipulation on a grand scale”, and said it would hold the president fully responsible of any proven fraud.
Abdallah Djaballah of the Front for Justice and Development (FJD) initially condemned Thursday’s vote as an “electoral charade”. He took a harsher tone on Sunday, telling AFP that the results “closed the door on change by the ballot box”.
“The Tunisian option is all that’s left for those who believe in change,” Djaballah said.
The FJD is also threatening to withdraw from Parliament after winning just seven of the 462 available seats.
Abdelmadjid Menasra of the Front for Change called the election “worse than fraud”, saying it “was a sham from the outset”. Islamist parties failed to rally voters in support of their manifestos, Menasra said, but he refused to accept their defeat.
The former FIS gave its response to the election result in a statement signed by leaders Abassi Madani and Ali Belhadj. “The legislative elections highlight the deepening crisis of confidence between the people of Algeria and a corrupt regime,” they wrote.
The result came as a blow to the Islamist parties, who had hoped that the Arab Spring would spill over into Algeria.
Analyst Mounir Boudjemaa said the poll signalled a decline of political Islamism in Algeria.
“The Green Alliance is a victim of its own contradictions,” he told Magharebia. “How can a party like the MSP (Movement of Society for Peace), which was in government and decided at the last minute to go over to the opposition, remain in government? This is not credible in the eyes of the public.”
“What happened during the Arab Spring had an effect on Algerians, but not necessarily in the way the outside world expected,” said Noureddine Hakiki, a political observer.
“In Egypt, in Libya… there was change, but it took the form of regression and disorder. Algerians don’t want insecurity, they want stability”, he said.
“We’ve been there and done that with Islamism; it’s an era we’ll never forget. Everyone was deeply affected by the war. It’s a chapter that this generation doesn’t want to reopen,” Hakiki said.
The smooth running of the poll drew praise from the international observers sent to monitor it. The international community unanimously welcomed the lack of major incidents and the election of 120 women to Parliament.

Nucleoli are dynamic structures described a few hundred years ago as distinct nuclear compartments, easily visualized under the light microscope, and the place of birth for ribosomes [ [
Synthesis of new ribosomes is an essential and energy consuming cellular process controlled directly or indirectly by oncogenes and tumor suppressors including c-Myc, PTEN and p53 [
The nucleolus responds quickly to several forms of cellular stress (
One bottleneck in cancer cell proliferation is the rate of ribosome production since an abundance of ribosomes is needed to sustain cell growth and proliferation. HeLa cells for instance produce several thousands of ribosomes per minute [
Conditions that induce nucleolar stress and lead to p53-induced effects on cells. A wide range of cell stressors, small molecules, or mutant nucleolar/ribosomal proteins can block ribosomal RNA synthesis or processing thereby inhibiting ribosome biogenesis. The resulting nucleolar stress activates signaling pathways that may lead to p53-induced cell cycle arrest, apoptosis, differentiation, and/or senescence dependent on cell type and level of stress.
Many chemotherapeutic drugs inhibit either rDNA transcription or rRNA processing [
The nucleolus undergoes dramatic visible morphological changes and molecular re-arrangements when exposed to different cytostatic/cytotoxic compounds [
Another dramatic effect on the nucleolus can be seen in cells exposed to low concentrations of Actinomycin D (<10 nM), that preferentially inhibits transcription by RNA pol I [
It is important to emphasize that the majority of ribosomal proteins play critical roles in either ribosomal RNA processing, ribosome subunit assembly or pre-ribosome subunit export [
Examples of changes in nucleolar morphology induced by nucleolar stress. U2OS osteosarcoma cells were treated with 5nM Actinomycin D (Act D) for two hours, which induced a rapid shrinkage of the nucleoli (middle panel) compared to control cells (left panel). The arrow points at one nucleolus in the control sample. U2OS cells were also treated with 5,6-dichloro-1-beta-D-ribofuranosylbenzimidazole (DRB) for 6 hours, a drug that induces unraveling and fragmentation of nucleoli by inhibition of RNA pol II dependent transcription (right panel). The granular component (GC) appears as a remnant dark dot (red arrow) whereas the fibrillar centers containing the rDNA genes unravel and disperse throughout the nucleoplasm surrounding the remnant GC (white arrow).
An intact ribosome biogenesis apparatus is required for normal human development, and several human genetic disorders that stem from defects in key proteins of the ribosome biogenesis machinery have been described, reviewed in references [ [
The mechanism of p53 activation following nucleolar stress is not completely understood. There are at present two main models although they may represent different sides of the same coin [
Using micropore irradiation of cell nuclei, Rubbi and Milner could show that extensive DNA damage in the nucleus failed to stabilize p53 unless the nucleolus was also irradiated [
The second model states that a subset of ribosomal proteins binds to the MDM2 protein following disruption of ribosome biogenesis leading to inhibition of the MDM2 E3 ubiquitin ligase activity and p53 stabilization [ [
As mentioned, another remaining issue is if RPL11 and RPL5 activate p53 in DBA patients. It is conceivable that p53 activation causes at least some of the DBA phenotypes [ [
The ubiquitin like molecule
The RPL11-MDM2-p53 molecular network regulating nucleolar stress. Simplified schematic representation of the cell nucleus and nucleolus under normal conditions (upper panel) and following nucleolar stress (lower panel). In the nucleolus, RPL11 is modified by NEDD8 and binds to PICT1 and can also recruit the PML protein. RPL11 and other nucleolar proteins including the histone chaperone NPM1 [
As mentioned, acetylation of p53 may play an important role in stabilization of the protein and activation of its transcriptional functions. As recently described, Myb-binding protein 1a ( [

Ribosome biogenesis in malignant cells should be exploited as an anti-cancer therapy target since this is one of the major biosynthetic activities in the cancer cell [

Fantasy Analysis:
This is a big blow to New England's offense but they have enough talent on offense where this really should not hold them back. TE Rob Gronkowski
should see the biggest bump to his fantasy point total since he often works the underneath routes. In addition, since WR Wes Welker
has been limited in the Pats' first two games, New England may opt for more three-WR sets. As for Winslow's fantasy impact, I wouldn't consider adding him until he produced on the field. Hernandez is worth stashing on your bench for the next month.Contact Admissions Counselors

Michael Tilson Thomas and the San Francisco Symphony have begun their two-week Beethoven festival, dubbed the "Beethoven Project." One of its goals is scholarly: to connect the dots between some of the titan's early rarities and his late-period ascensions. But, basically, what Thursday's opening program accomplished was to make your jaw drop.
The program -- the first of its two performances -- was devoted to those youthful rarities, including "some really oddball stuff," which is how John Mangum, the orchestra's director of artistic planning, put it in a pre-concert talk. The most oddball was the Sonatina in C major for Mandolin and Fortepiano, sort of a 19th-century bluegrass prophecy; more on that later. The jaw-dropper was the Cantata on the Death of the Emperor Joseph II, a massive work for orchestra, chorus and four soloists, which points toward much later masterworks -- and which Beethoven composed at age 19.
Not fair, right?
Composed in 1790 -- after the passing of the Holy Roman Empire's monarch -- this grand endeavor stretches across 40 minutes. (You may recognize some of its themes; Beethoven recycled them into "Fidelio.")" Beethoven; likewise, a delicate chorale for winds; and the entwining of solo voices, chorus and instrumental forces, all commandingly marshaled by Tilson Thomas, making for a vast and expressive emotional matrix.
The San Francisco Symphony Chorus, directed by Ragnar Bohlin, gripped onto this piece from its opening outbursts: "Todt! Todt! Todt!" ("Dead! Dead! Dead!"). Then four strong soloists dove straight in: soprano Sally Matthews, mezzo-soprano Tamara Mumford, tenor Barry Banks and bass-baritone Andrew Foster-Williams.
Beethoven assigns two central arias and a recitative to the soprano, and Matthews lived up to her star billing. One could listen all night to her singing: exquisite, plush and very mezzo-y. She traced the curve of Beethoven's swan's-neck melodies, conveying their deep solace. Her first aria seemed predictive of Brahms' Alto Rhapsody; interesting, as Brahms was a fan of this cantata, which was first performed in 1884, long after Beethoven's death.
The gravity of this work stood in contrast to the one preceding it: "Adelaide," a song from 1796, setting verse by German Romantic poet Friedrich Matthisson and exuding a young man's pure-hearted love of a woman. Composed by Beethoven for piano and voice, it has been newly arranged for chorus by Bohlin, who conducted. (The sole instrumentalist was principal keyboardist Robin Sutherland, playing Beethoven's original piano part, superbly.)
These expanded accolades for "Adelaide" were gorgeous: love's rustlings and murmurs, echoing and lapping through the chorus. Oh, Adelaide!
After intermission, as the house lights dimmed and patrons rushed to their seats, it was time for the "oddball" stuff: mandolinist Joseph Brent and fortepianist Eric Zivian were spot-lit in a far corner of the stage, looking as if they had wandered in from one of Wes Anderson's film sets. They launched into the aforementioned Sonatina; a quiet, quirky and charming performance. And very folkish; its finger-picking principal theme is a bluegrass forerunner. Who knew?
This imaginative program concluded with something more familiar: Symphony No. 2 in D major, which the orchestra was recording for future release on CD. To these ears, the spacious opening movements weren't vivid enough; Tilson Thomas was locked into a dynamic mid-range. The Scherzo was elegant, somewhat slower and less comically exaggerated than in many performances. The finale was best, skewering that outrageous theme which sounds like Buster Keaton tumbling down a flight of stairs and leaping to his feet. For all his familiarity, Beethoven still surprises.

1. SUSPENSION/BRAKES
The general suspension and chassis design on these cars is superb, but R26-R aside, they’re a little soft for ultimate grip and handling. The solution is simple in the form of a full coilover suspension kit. Most of the top suspension manufacturers already have kits available, so it’s an easy upgrade. The standard brakes are pretty good, but big brake kits are already available and are a wise move for tuned and track-used cars.

“We knew that the community wanted tools to make collaboration easier, but we didn’t realize the amount of impact the tools would have. Our efforts for the past year will continue to pay dividends in 2011 as we release more sophisticated tools to aid our community’s research efforts,” said Geni’s President Noah Tutak.
Geni has experienced a tremendous growth phase by dedicating resources to the development of many features that empower the Geni community to solve the problem of genealogy: forming a single family tree of the world. Geni’s significant growth is a result of several factors:
- Features introduced on Geni in 2010 have created a Wikipedia-style environment for research and collaboration.
- Geni is a free service with a premium model, meaning anyone can use the vast majority of the features on the site without a barrier-to-entry, including profile merging and search capabilities for documents, discussions and more than a hundred million profiles.
- The release of an API that allows the automation of many collaborative tasks.
- Implementation of tr8n, an open source translation tool that Geni developed to crowd source the site’s translation efforts.
With the release of the API, Geni has become a vast information source for third parties ranging from international genealogical societies to researchers at MIT. As the API functionality expands and the collaboration efforts grow, Geni is positioned to become a key resource for historians, anthropologists, and genealogy experts around the globe.

Zakaria, who hosts a show on CNN, allegedly lifted copy from a New Yorker article on gun control for his regular column in Time. He apologized for the mistake, and Time has suspended his column for a month.
Zakaria spoke to Michigan policy and business leaders about job creation on May 29 on Mackinac Island.

CM Punk comes out to say he’s going to help Laurinaitis learn what the people really want, given his “People Power” campaign. Punk managed to get political for an instant when he implied that Laurinaitis was a Republican (I’m already sick of typing the general manager’s last name, so he’ll just be “Johnny Ace” for the rest of this article).

Commercial break.
After a commercial break, we are shown a replay of last week’s Tag Team Title exchange. Then we get Kofi Kingston vs. Dolph Ziggler, with all of the ringside characters you’d assume.
The rumor sheets, as of Monday afternoon, all said Mason Ryan was Ziggler’s new bodyguard. Instead, we see Ryan backstage with Epico, Primo, Rosa and AW, watching Kofi/Ziggler on a monitor. We are informed by Cole that a) AW has said he is waiting for just the right moment to invoke Epico and Primo's rematch, and, b) AW is willing to work with anyone who wants his services.
Ziggler gets the pin after Swagger interferes. It's about time one of Vickie's boys got a win on a show other than Superstars. *** I predict AW requests the Tag Title rematch for Over the Limit, then Vickie gets Ziggler/Swagger thrown into the match as well, and AW throws a fit.

Up next is Randy Orton and Sheamus vs. Chris Jericho and Alberto Del Rio. All four men get their full-length intros. This feels reeeeeeally long. As the match starts, I begin to wonder if their’s an ulterior motive for putting Y2J into a match with three SmackDown superstars.
Great match out of all four competitors. The contest ended when Sheamus accidentally nailed Orton with the Brogue Kick. Y2J got the pin on the World Heavyweight Champion, giving both Jericho and Orton a reason to potentially be involved in the title match at Over the Limit. Orton nails Sheamus with the RKO before leaving the ring.
We return from a commercial break, and Johnny Ace sends Eve out to tell The Big Show that his apology didn’t seem sincere. As soon as she leaves, Johnny is approached by ADR, Y2J and Orton, all claiming to deserve a shot at the World Heavyweight Championship.
Sheamus joins the fray and gets called a “clumsy ass” by Orton. Johnny Ace tells Sheamus his title defense at Over the Limit will be a Fatal Four-Way.
Hold up! So you're telling me that at Extreme Rules, Chris Jericho lost (for the second time on consecutive PPVs) to CM Punk in a match for the WWE Championship, and Daniel Bryan lost (for the second time on consecutive PPVs) to Sheamus in a match for the World Heavyweight Championship—and then the next PPV, they both get title shots against the champion of the brand they don't work for? DOES ANYONE ELSE HAVE A PROBLEM WITH THIS?
The Funkasauras is up next, bringing the Fuckadactyls with him, getting the Funkateers pumped. The Miz is introduced as his opponent and does a great bit on the mic that includes a Mike Tyson’s Punchout reference to “King Hippo.”
I’m a bigger fan of The Miz than most. I really don’t want to see The Miz job to Brodus Clay, but I don’t have high hopes. Brodus Clay gets the victory, and without any mention of Swagger or Ziggler, it looks like the Funkasauras has moved on. ***I predict Brodus Clay will suffer his first real loss sometime after No Way Out, building a legitimate feud with a pay-off at Money In The Bank. Then he challenges for the US or IC Title at SummerSlam.
The Miz continues to be used way below his potential. I thought there was supposed to be a big pay-off after his win for Johnny Ace at WrestleMania 28. WHEN WILL THE MIZ RETURN TO PROMINENCE?
Does anyone else think it’s funny that Eve, Mark Henry, Alberto Del Rio and Sheamus represent WWE for the Be A Star anti-bullying campaign? These are little kids.
Isn't WWE sending a mixed message? Maybe I’m just not giving today’s youth the credit they deserve for being able to distinguish between reality and what they see on WWE programming.
After the commercial break, we get an update on the “injury” of COO Triple H, but not before sitting through a recap of last week’s attack.
If you watch SmackDown and Superstars, this is the fourth time you’ve seen this (if you include Raw last week). Probably the fifth, since I’m sure there was at least one replay on Raw last week. Triple H is apparently scheduled for surgery, is currently wearing some crazy arm-brace, is still performing his duties as COO and as part of Floyd Mayweather’s entourage and will be live on Raw next week.
Cole informs us that Brock was invited to join the show tonight but sent his “legal representation” instead. Out comes Paul Heyman!
I really, really hope Heyman remains on WWE television for the duration of Lesnar’s stay. Heyman reads a letter from Brock that claims he’s never coming back. ***I predict Triple H calls out Paul Heyman next week and informs him that Brock Lesnar can't quit (due to contractual obligation). This will directly or indirectly lead to Lesnar/Helmsley at SummerSlam.
The Big Show is backstage chatting with a couple of guys from some struggling USA show about sexy detectives. They start making fun of Johnny Ace’s voice. TBS laughs like the Jolly Green Giant, and Eve approaches.
Time for a sexy reprimand! To his credit, The Big Show has a great “Aww shit, I'm busted!” face. If he keeps it up, he may land a legitimate acting role some day, a la Andre the Giant in The Princess Bride.
As CM Punk comes to the ring for his match against Lord Tensai, Johnny Ace interjects and informs the WWE Champion that it will be a handicap match. Daniel Bryan gets to join Tensai.
Solid match from three solid grapplers. CM Punk is often compared to Steve Austin, but he doesn’t have the superpower of always overcoming all obstacles, so he loses the handicap match, and Raw goes off the air after Bryan gets him in the Yes Lock.
Let's hope these two feud for a really long time, as they aren't giving their match at OTL the buildup that it deserves.
Cliff's Notes
Both Cena and Orton used the word "ass" this week—looks like we're slowly on our way to a higher parental rating. Brock Lesnar no-showed/claimed to quit via "legal representative" Paul Heyman.
Cena only appeared via satellite, but the show still felt stacked. Mason Ryan has apparently joined AW's crew, along with Epico, Primo and Rosa. The Big Show seems to be feuding with Eve. Beth Phoenix is back on TV, and the Miz is the most recent victim of the Funkasauras.
The Tag Team Division and Divas Division are starting to take shape, but they still have a lot of work to do.
Orton has reasserted himself into the World Heavyweight Title picture, and OTL will prove whether Sheamus is legit or simply a paper champion. Lord Tensai remains a part of the main event picture, and John Laurinaitis/Eve are feuding with just about everyone.
Over the Limit isn't looking as promising as Extreme Rules, but it has potential. WWE has a week and a half to seduce the few members of the WWE Universe that still legally purchase PPVs.Since your web browser does not support JavaScript,

Posted
The first project to recover environmental water using the Murray-Darling Basin Plan's adjustment mechanism has been announced.
The Victorian Government will spend $56 million to build a regulator and several other structures at Lindsay Island, about five kilometres over the South Australian border, near Renmark.
The water-saving project will utilise the funding which had been allocated for water buybacks.
The Victorian Agriculture Minister, Peter Walsh, says it will deliver water to the floodplain, with as little as one-ninth of the water.
"You can flood the floodplain approximately an additional 6,000 hectares, you can achieve the outcomes for the environment based on a 10 or 15,000 meg a day river, rather than having to have a major flood event of 80 or 90,000 megalitres a day to flood that river," he said.
He says it is good news for the environment and food producers.
"It's anticipated that there would be significant savings, so you could achieve those environmental outcomes that are described by the plan but you could achieve it with smarter use of held water by the environment," he said.
"The environment doesn't need to take as much out of food production."
However, Riverland irrigators say they have not been properly consulted over the project.
Lindsay Point almond grower Paul Martin says he wants to know what effect the new structures will have on river flows.
"I'm concerned as an irrigator that we don't get left with a reduced flow, which particularly, following the flood years, could give us a high salinity level in the Lindsay Creek and that's always ... [a] concern in any of these alterations to the system," he said.
"The amount of consultation we have had on this issue is minuscule. I've learnt a bit about what's happening but there's ... a lot more happening than what I've been told and I would think my neighbours are equally in the dark.
"So look, until we get some detail and someone explains what's going and what the impacts are, we're all going to be a bit nervous."

Nice game
Here are some hints:
1. While a enemy is in the air he is at your mercy and can be kept there with your uzi, if that wasn't good enough if you press space while a enemy is in the air they'll fly upwards allowing you to shot them a few times press space then pile in some shots.
2. The aggresser can fill the screen with spike balls very quick.
3. If you pause the game while you lava bomb is damaging a enemy it will keep doing damage works on bosses.
3. The pimp turret is overpowered as are the scatter shot and the rocket launcher the falcon gun and the gravetry gun are rubbish in comparsion,

In order to be successful as a first-time entrepreneur, it’s important to understand that as your business grows, what got you to where you are won’t necessarily keep moving you forward.
In his excellent book The Hard Things About Hard Things, Ben Horowitz explains why it’s important to be almost short-sighted when hiring people into your business. Instead of wondering whether new hires will be able to grow with your business over the next few years, he suggests only looking at the next 18 months, because by then you’ll be a completely different business and your needs will have changed.
Most fast-growing startups (growing at least 100 percent year-on-year) go through three distinct phases over their lifetime and knowing which phase you’re currently in will help you be prepared as you transition to the next phase.
Let’s look at each phase in a bit of detail.
Phase 1 – Validation
Key focus: product-market fit
Key milestone: initial paying customers
Key people: founders
Typical revenue: $1M or less
Typical size: 5 people or less
Example companies: Buffer, Secret, Shyp
In this phase you have a small team consisting of a few founders and maybe a few extra people, whether that be software engineers, support people, etc. During this phase you’re not generating much (if any) revenue and you may or may not have proven product-market fit.
Your one and only focus is on building an amazing product and getting the word out by any means possible. Your team all sit together and instead of meetings you just walk up to someone and speak to them.
Your goal at this point is launching your product if you haven’t already. If you have, your goal might involve getting your first 1,000 free users or 100 paying users. You’re not thinking too much about becoming a big business, raising capital or going on a hiring spree. You just want to build something that’s validated by a market of people who’ll appreciate your effort.
Phase 2 – Revenue
Key focus: sales funnel
Key milestone: conversion rate & culture (internal NPS)
Key people: leadership team (founders & management team)
Typical revenue: $1M-$10M
Typical size: 5-100 people
Example companies: Pebble, Medium, Hipmunk
You’ve proven product market fit and are confident there’s a huge T.A.M. (Total Addressable Market) of customers who will willingly pay for your product. During phase 2, most startups focus on really understanding their funnel metrics which include traffic, leads, conversion rate and retention rate (by number of customers and by revenue) because getting these metrics to acceptable levels means the business is ready for phase 3.
Optimization of the sales process, which includes website (especially checkout and free trial if applicable) and possibly a small sales team, are critical. Improving your visitor to trial conversion rate by just a few percent can have a huge impact on your revenue, so getting an intimate understanding of conversion rate optimization and split testing during phase 2 should be a top priority.
Also critical to a phase 2 startup is building a team of capable leaders around the founders and thinking about the role each founder will play as the business starts to scale. It’s important to think about the strengths and weaknesses of each founder.
Just because you’re a founder, doesn’t mean you need to be CEO, for example. If you’re an amazing engineer then there’s nothing wrong with hiring a capable CEO to help you craft an overall strategy for the business.
During phase 2, it’s critical to be very selective during the hiring process as this is where bad hiring can damage the culture and future potential of your business. For Bigcommerce, Eddie and I interviewed every one of our first 100 employees together. It was hard, but we knew it would help us build a foundational team that aligned with our values.
By now you may have also raised a series A round of financing to help with the increasing costs of building the business. If you’re going for growth, profitability may be a few years out, so being able to cover salaries and others costs while you grow becomes important.
As a rule of thumb, phase 2 startups should aim to have at least 18 months of runway (cash in the bank to cover expenses) after raising a round of financing.
Phase 3 – Scale
Key focus: market share
Key milestone: revenue
Key people: executive team
Typical revenue: $10M-$100M+
Typical size: 100-1,000 people
Example companies: Uber, Dropbox, Spotify
Now that you understand (and have optimized) your key business metrics and have built a capable executive team with a few dozen (or a few hundred) employees, it’s time to double down on the business and focus on scale – scaling your people, scaling your technology, scaling your marketing and scaling your customer acquisition.
If you hit or exceeded the financial forecast you created when you raised your initial round of financing then you’ll probably raise more money – somewhere in the $10-$50M range over one or two rounds so you can spend aggressively on customer acquisition and talent.
Most phase 3 companies have mature organisational structures by now including a full executive team of 5 to 20 people, as well as multiple offices depending on where they do business.
The key focus may start to shift from revenue growth to profitability as many phase 3 companies start contemplating an exit, especially those that have raised venture capital. An exit could be going public or being acquired by a larger player interested in your space.
An important consideration for phase 3 companies is speed and politics inside the business. Founders and executives should lead by example with core values that reflect an organisation free of politics, bias and favouritism.
Speed in all areas of the business should also be rewarded and recognised regularly. It’s important that employees in a phase 3 company understand that regardless of how well your business is doing, you’re never done, so a cultural bias towards ambition and a drive to win are important.Israel Allows In 7 Syrian Refugees as Fighting Nears Border

Product Description
By Jim GaramoneAmerican Forces Press Service
WASHINGTON, Dec. 19, 2006 "There are more forces trying to unite Iraq than are trying to pull it apart,” Army Lt. Gen. Martin Dempsey said today in Baghdad.
“So long as they don't give up on themselves, we won't give up on them,” the commander of Multinational Security Transition Command Iraq told Pentagon reporters during a teleconference.
“Iraqi security forces will reach their goal of 325,000 trained and equipped members this month,” he said. As of Dec. 13, the Iraqi Interior Ministry forces numbered about 188,300 while the Defense Ministry had about 134,700.
But these forces, while effective, need more training, Dempsey said. He said that 2007 will be a year where the coalition will help the Iraqi forces become more capable.
“In particular, we will focus on intelligence, logistics and leaders,” Dempsey said.
Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki has announced that the Iraqi army must grow by 19,000 soldiers. This means another 20 battalions, five brigade headquarters and three division headquarters. This growth will allow Iraqi commanders to place additional forces in the the most heavily contested provinces, Dempsey said. The increase will also allow commanders “to pull units off line from time to time to rearm, refit and retrain.”
The prime minister wants the Iraqi army to be more responsive and deployable. “We've helped the minister of Defense develop a plan to form an operational reserve that will be functional and deployable throughout Iraq in early 2007,” Dempsey said.
The Iraqi government is funding the manpower increase, Dempsey said, and that in itself is important. “The significance of this is that the security ministers are beginning to take financial responsibility for equipping their own security forces,” he said.
Iraqi leaders are reaching out to take control of the country’s security, Dempsey said. This is all part of the transitions occurring throughout the country, as coalition forces turn over responsibility to Iraqi forces.
“Transitions from our control to theirs are occurring almost every day, in things as visible to you as control of battlespace and as invisible, but just as important, as financial responsibility for life-support contracts, management of the training base and distribution of fuel and ammunition,” Dempsey said.
Dempsey said his command is working closely with Interior Ministry officials to train and, in some cases, reform the police. Coalition personnel are mentoring Iraqi personnel at the ministry level, and the Iraqis are cracking down on corruption and disloyalty in the ministry itself, said Multinational Forces Iraq officials in Baghdad.
Interior officials also called for whole national police brigades to be retrained. This so-called “re-bluing” of the police was intended to get rid of corrupt leaders and to give police more professional skills.
On a more tactical level, coalition personnel are working to reform selected police stations, beginning with Baghdad, Dempsey said. All of these efforts have the idea of increasing police capabilities and addressing the problems of militia influence in the police, the general said.
The interior and defense ministers understand that they have to assess and address the loyalty of their forces, Dempsey said.
“Transitions are always challenging, and these transitions are especially challenging,” the general said. “But it's vital that we continue to acknowledge and encourage the desire of Iraq's civilian, military and police leaders to take charge.”Discover a selection of top forums freeware pimp on the internet.

Regis University, the fourth-seeded team in the RMAC baseball tournament, won the title 9-2 over CSU-Pueblo on Saturday in Pueblo, claiming the conference’s automatic berth in the NCAA Division II Central Region tournament this week.
Top-seeded Colorado Mesa, which went 1-2, is ranked No. 2 in the region and will get a spot in the tournament when pairings are announced late this evening.
Minnesota State-Mankato defeated the top-ranked team in the region, St. Cloud State, 9-7 on Saturday to force a second title game, which it won 11-6 to win the Northern Sun conference title.
Mankato is ranked third in the region and could jump into the No. 1 spot and host the regional tournament. Regis, which was No. 8 in the region, will get one of the six spots, likely knocking out either No. 5 Wayne State, which went 0-2 in the NSIC tournament, or No. 6 Winona State, which went 1-2 but beat Wayne State.
New Mexico Highlands is fourth in the region.

At a Glance
(1 items)
Layout $2.00Amazon Shop buttons are programmatically attached to all reviews, regardless of products' final review scores. Our parent company, IDG, receives advertisement revenue for shopping activity generated by the links. Because the buttons are attached programmatically, they should not be interpreted as editorial endorsements.
If you thought photo collages were a thing of the past, think again. In reality, they’ve merely gone the way of Polaroids and telephone handsets—they died for awhile, but are coming back to life with major digital mojo. Layout, a photo-editing app for iPad 2 or later, helps you create and share photo layouts for easy collage storytelling.
True to its name, Layout gives you control over your collage's look, from background and border thickness to aspect ratio and photo fill settings. While the program ships with fully editable preset templates, you can also construct your own from scratch. I found it's way more fun to swipe and cut your own layout. The process feels like playing Fruit Ninja, albeit with more tactile results.
Layout does limit how much you can chop and divide your photos, and the manual swipe has some quirks. For instance, you must swipe in the center and then adjust the frame, rather than swiping where you want new divider to show—but that's an easy adjustment.
To add a picture to a section, just tap the empty space and a selection wheel will pop up. From the photo icon, you can access photos from your Camera Roll or from your Facebook, Twitter, Flickr, or Instagram feed. To access online photo services, turn on Enhanced Picker from the cog icon at the top left of the screen.
Juicy Bits Software, the developers of this app, really take advantage of the iPad’s touch gesture abilities by allowing you to pinch and zoom in to your photos, and to drag and reposition your them within each frame. There's a face detection utility too, which zooms into faces, but be warned: The app will really zoom into your face, and even some photos I shot with a DSLR looked grainy when zoomed in that close.
You can also edit your photo from the app's radial menu. Just tap on the magic wand icon for a particular image and perform basic photo edits, crop or change the orientation, apply various filters or effects, and draw or add stickers on your photo. Oddly, you have to manually install the supplied sticker pack, even though it’s free.
Though the range of possible edits is extensive, I did have a few issues with the Photo Editor. When you go to a different section—say, Effects or Enhance—and apply those edits, you must remember to tap the Done button to exit out of the Photo Editor. Even if you applied effects in the previous screen, they will not appear on your images unless you tap Done.
There is no Undo/Redo function in the Photo Editor, which can be annoying if you're layering edits. Plus, if you apply an effect and later want to revert the image to the original, you’ll have to re-import the image or tap Undo from the main screen until you reach the desired editing stage. That's inconvenient because you can't preview what your edited images will look like in relation to other images in the collage while working in the Photo Editor.
On the other hand, Layout offers some helpful utilities that I wasn’t expecting. For instance, if you have pre-existing captions on your photos, and then go to change the caption size of a different photo in the layout, a triangular arrow points down, directing you to the font size setting in your other captions. This feature lets you visually drag and lock the text to a particular size. Or, if you select Apply to All, the app will apply one font setting to all captions in your layout. Unfortunately, there's no choice of caption colors, which feels limiting. The color options (black or white) are automatically selected, though you can choose whether your caption has a background or not. It’s a small request, but I'd also like the ability to place text anywhere on the layout and to add a title to my collages.
If you plan to print your collage—even if you're not using Layout for your year-end holiday greeting card—be sure to enable the larger project size. Layout’s largest output is 2048 x 2048 pixels (or 4 megapixels), so you'll need that higher resolution for print-quality photos.
Whatever size you choose, you can print your layout directly from the app, email it, or export it to Camera Roll, Facebook, Twitter, or Flickr.
Layout is designed to be an easy-to-use tool for creating quick, creative collages on the go. While more flexible text and editing features would be welcome, Layout delivers on its basic promise: minimum effort, quick results, and easy-to-share finished products.Click to expand

Reported: 1/4/2014 10:46:00 PM 22:46
Posted: 1/10/2014
Location: Long Beach, CA
Shape: Light
Duration:7:00 minutes
LONG BEACH, CA.. interacted with a UFO while stargazing and using a Green high output laser beam.
so i was star gazing in my back yard as i normally do and i come across a star i think is moving that may just be a. i recently purchased a green laser which emits a visible beam 5miles, like what you see in the military. i come across what i think is a satellite . so i point my laser at it and it seems to have moved away from it, i thought i was tripping or maybe had shaky hands so i position myself against my step fathers truck to get a posture while pointing and using my 2 hands instead of one.
Here comes the crazy part. As i start pointing my laser at this object i notice that it is moving and not moving in a single direction as you would see with a satellite. this thing starts moving left, right, side to side almost trying get out of my beam as i point at it, i do this for about 2 mins until i start feeling like i should tell some one but know one at my home was home and nor where any of my neighbors in their backyards .
So what do i do ? well, i thought since i am seeing this and i cant tell know one nor video tape it i get the idea to start circling the object as to attract people to looking at it instead of me pointing a laser directly on it. i want to add that this idea came because i live along side the 710 fwy and i know for a fact people can see my beam from far so i new i can maybe get some people in traffic to see it and i hopefully was successful with that cause what happen next gave me the chills up and down my spine and i still have the chills as i write this. also i want to add that this isn't the first time i seen something i cant identify, but it is the first time i ever interacted with one .
As i start circling the object it get more aggressive to moving away from the light as if knowing i am circling it and in doing so giving up its position , i continue to do so and it keeps trying get out of the circle i put it in, i then notice that when ever the beam would be in front of its direction it will quickly move away from it as if it was scared of crossing it as weird as it sounds. i know this wasn't a satellite nor a plan cause planes cant move that fast nor in the aggressive manner this object moved. I then start to notice that this object is positioning itself over my house , pretty much right over me so at this point i am pointing straight up with my neck looking straight up to the point my neck hurts . i got kinda freaked out at that point even more and start thinking about all abduction movies and thinking maybe this thing is position itself over me to know my location, i don't know but it really freaked me out . now my laser starts dying which emits a le! ss visible beam that can bee seen , at this same time i notice the object starts to also fade but still remains over what looks to me like its directly over me but just in the heavens with the stars pretty much hanging out flying around. my laser then dies and honestly i felt alone at that moment cause i was in complete darkness and it hit me that what i was seeing was real and was interacting with me and my laser beam . i stare at it for a couple mins more , noticing that its not really moving anymore but staying directly above me where it positioned itself in the heavens.
my lasers off,i am in darkness, i start getting more freaked out thinking that maybe its gonna get me , beam me up , i just start thinking of all the movies i seen with people interacting with ufo's which never end well. i wont lie i start feeling fear in me and something telling me go inside the house and recharge my laser. i do so , and decide to report for the first time an experience i have with a ufo that to me is the scariest encounter i have ever had the privilege of seeing . since a kid i have star gazed, i am 29. i have seen many weird things in the skies i cant explain to this day which i am sure allot of people have seen things many times also if they star gaze frequently thru their life . what i saw was real and i really cant explain any more into detail about it but what i explained . i haven't gone back outside my house yet and do plan to after i finish this sighting description . honestly i am kinda scared to go back out and look at the sky and or see if its s! till in the same spot but i am only because of my curiosity and faith that nothing bad will happen to me .
it looked exactly like a dim star or satellite that moves in a single continues lane that many people i am sure have seen . it didn't make any different colors it just stayed white like the stars , it moved quick, it moved away from my laser as if it were scared of it or didn't want to be seen or pointed out. i don't know what it was but know it wasn't a plane . i really wish i had someone over tonight to be my witness . i actually bought the laser because i would frequently see things through out my life in the skies, that i just wanted to finally point them out when star gazing and hopefully show other people . sadly i was alone and still am , my report is done and i hope who ever reads this maybe gets the same idea with the laser pointer and or someone saw a green beam pointing along the 710 fwy at an object moving away from my beam in the skies high above the heavens , at 9:00 pm . this is is not a hoax. hopefully some one has seen something similar or interacted with a ! ufo as i have with a high output green laser beam ..

Funny?
Earlier in the week I received this email:
WTF? I've never left a comment on a youtube video. I click through to see this:
Ugh...My son. He's pretty much ruled the Xoom since we got it a couple of months ago and he watches all the Rome Total War videos (I did learn that the History channel used the creator's graphics engine for the re-enactment of ancient battles...good to know). Anyway, I let him use it and it uses my Google account.
He had asked about a week ago how to leave comments and I told him that he wasn't allowed to. Apparently he had done this before asking. I chastised him appropriately. We banned the Xoom for a week.
I can't help but laugh though. I sent it to Kris then ran downstairs to make her look too. LC wanted to know what we were looking at and I had to kick him out of the room because I saw Kris' face start to light up in laughter. It was funny, but we have to be parents.
That's all I got...the well is dry. I was hoping this would stir some thoughts, but apparently not.

No Thanks"I am pained. Though I have no resigned from the party, I will definitely arrive at a decision on what to do within a day or two," he said in Delhi.Read: LS elections: Lalu announces list of 25 candidates
Ram Kripal had earlier made it known that he resented 'parivarvad' (dynastic trend) in the RJD and Lalu ignoring senior party leaders.
He did not receive or meet Misa. Asked if he would join the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), he replied, “I have not decided.”
There is talk of the BJP making Ram Kripal its candidate from Patliputra or Madhepura if he switches over.
A top BJP leader who did not want to be named said, "You could wait for a surprise at Madhepura." Read: Lalu Prasad faces revolt after fielding daughter
Lalu, who was to campaign in Saran area for his wife, Rabri Devi, a former chief minister, said, "Ram Kripal is my best MP and the most seasoned politician. He can never ditch me.”
Lalu downplayed talk of rebellion, saying, "(Ram Kripal) Yadav never asked for Patliputra seat and I am not aware of his annoyance. I think he is being influenced by some party. We need him in our fight for social justice.”
Rabri Devi said, "He is like my devar (brother-in-law). He is still in the party and will never leave it. In any case, he has not resigned.”
Misa said, "I will never stand from Patliputra if such a tall leader of the party with over 30 years in politics wants it. He is like my uncle. I am ready to withdraw ".
Ram Kripal’s displeasure came to light on Thursday evening, when Lalu convened a press meet to release the list of candidates for 25 of the 27 seats the RJD will contest in the Lok Sabha polls. The RJD’s allies, the Congress and the NCP, have got 12 and one seat respectively.HT poll result: 74% voters agree with Lalu's allegations, says Nitish is behind RJD split
The RJD is grappling with the Rajya Sabha member’s annoyance soon after a revolt by Gulam Gaus, leader of the party in Bihar council.
Gaus said Lalu had ignored backward Muslims to create a Sheikhdom. He said he would take the field independently against the RJD candidate in West Champaran.
Lalu has not yet nominated a candidate for Madhepura. Sources privy to the RJD’s internal workings said the party top brass had sent feelers to Ram Kripal to contest from the seat against Janata Dal (United) president Sharad Yadav.
RJD insiders are worried that a walkout by Ram Kripal will demoralise the party rank and file and benefit the BJP.
In the 2009 Lok Sabha polls, Lalu had lost the Pataliputra seat to JD(U)'s Ranjan Prasad Yadav. This time, another rebel RJD MLC, Nawal Kishore Yadav, is being touted as the BJP candidate for Patliputra, which has a huge Yadav segment.Whole Red Snapper Recipes14 recipes to browse.

Local police say the holiday could prove to be louder than previous celebrations, given the state’s new, relaxed fireworks law that allows for previously banned items such as bottle rockets, Roman candles and firecrackers.
So the message for residents? Keep the noise within reason, Kalamazoo Public Safety Chief Jeff Hadley said.
“It’s kind of an interesting clash … between the new fireworks law and the (city’s) existing noise ordinance,” Hadley said. “What we’ve directed our officers to do is use a reasonableness standard.
“With the holiday does come a certain expectation that there are going to be fireworks and there is going to be noise, but some people can take it too far and we’re going to have to use our best judgment on when we enforce the noise ordinance.”
At Monday’s City Commission meeting, some commissioners told Hadley they are concerned how the new fireworks law will affect city residents.
Commissioner Bob Cinabro said fireworks waking residents up at 2 a.m. is a quality of life issue.
“This is a topic that is very close to my heart,” he said. “I think it’s a serious quality of life issue in this community.”
City officials need to make sure the community is tranquil, Cinabro said, without constant fireworks noise up to 3 a.m.
“I’m just speaking as one person, as one citizen,” he said.
Hadley said Tuesday certain factors officers will take in to consideration when receiving a report of a possible noise violation are time of day and the circumstances.
He said it is likely that a resident setting off loud fireworks at, say, 9 p.m. on the Fourth is likely to get more leeway than a resident doing the same thing at 3 a.m. on July 5.
“I think that’s probably a pretty reasonable conclusion,” Hadley said. “It would depend on the individual officer and the individual circumstances.”
With the Fourth of July less than 24 hours away, Hadley admitted Tuesday that the dry conditions in the city and the increased danger of fires are of more concern to him right now than other issues that fireworks could present.
“Noise can be a nuisance and troublesome for a short period of time,” the chief said. “If something burns to the ground, that has long-lasting effects … for the individual and the community.”

In today's society, eyeglasses can now be ordered over the Internet, but first you will need to know how to measure eyeglasses properly. You do however need a prescription from the eye doctor to pick out new frames online, which can eliminate the fitting process. In order to ensure that your glasses will fit properly, you have to know how to measure eyeglasses accurately.
To measure eyeglasses you will need:
- an old pair of eyeglasses
- ruler with millimeters
- Measure the bridge size, which is the measurement across the nose. When you measure eyeglasses the bridge width is the horizontal distance between the nasal surfaces of the rim and the frame. The bridge is one of the most important measurements because it is the fit of the frame over your nose. You need your eyeglasses frames to sit comfortably on your nose to keep your eyeglasses from being irritating and annoying.
- Measure the lens width. The lens is the vertical measurement of the outer edges of one side of the lens to the outer edge of the other side of the lens. Measure both lenses to get the most accurate measurement. Make sure you measure eyeglasses lens properly because it is what will determine the fit of the frame on the glasses on your face. You don't want the eyeglasses frames to be too small or too big, but you want the frame to fit just right on your face.
- Measure the lens height. The lens height is the horizontal measurement from the highest point on the top of the lens to the lowest point of the bottom of the lens. The lens height is not required when ordering your eyeglasses online. The lens height will give you a general idea of the fit of the lens over your eye. When you measure eyeglasses lens height it will help you to see how narrow or tall your lens height is, and can help you find adequate frames that suite you when you order online.
- Measure the arm length. The arm length is the distance from the temple to the end of the arm on the frame. The arm length is the overall length of the side. It is measured from the dowel point (the bend where the arm attaches to the frame) to the length of the drop (the curve behind the ear). When you measure eyeglasses the arm length is important because it determines the comfort level of the fit over your ears.
Note: when using the millimeter ruler, make sure that you measure precisely, because the slightest off measurement can cause your eyeglasses not to fit properly. Always double check and triple check your measurements to ensure the proper fit when you order you eyeglasses..)Thursday, 29 Dec 2011 10:00 AM
Nancy Pelosi, wanna getaway? Sure, the House Minority leader said, “God bless the 99 percent,” but perhaps she should have added, “God forbid, if I’ll ever vacation like them.”
The former House Speaker is enjoying her holiday at a posh Hawaiian resort in a suite that costs $10,000 a night, while most vacationing Americans don’t come close to spending that in a year.
Nancy Pelosi is certainly not a member of the 99% she so publicly admires, and she doesn’t want to be.
For the second Christmas in a row, Pelosi is staying at the luxurious Four Seasons Resort Hualalai at Historic Ka'upulehu in Kona, reports the Hawaii Reporter.
According to the report, Nancy Pelosi has been escorted by local police during her two visits, at a cost of $34,000 to local taxpayers each visit, i.e. the 99 percent.
Editor's Note: Is this the Video that will cost Pelosi Her Job? Watch it now.
By the way, Congresswoman Pelosi’s colleague and fellow Democrat, President Obama, who is enjoying a 17-day vacation in Hawaii, is also racking up the charges.
The Reporter says his trip is costing around 4 million of the 99 percent’s hard earned dollars..
According to a New York Times analysis of financial disclosure, members of Congress got, on average, 15 percent richer during the past six years, while the average American’s net worth dropped 8 percent.
Members of Congress even fare better than the uber-wealthy.
While the net worth of the richest 10 percent of Americans has remained relatively unchanged since 2004, the net worth of lawmakers has enjoyed double-digit improvement, the Times reports.
So, what is the cause of this tremendous disparity?
If you ask Steve Kroft of CBS’s ‘60 Minutes,’ he’ll say one of the reasons is because of the lawmakers “legal” access to insider information.
Based on information provided by the conservative Hoover Institution, elected officials, like Pelosi, are exempt from insider trading laws – the same laws that would put any other citizen in prison.
Even if they are a member of the Pelosi’s favored 99 percent.
As it relates to elected officials – this secret information ranges from timely details on lucrative federal contracts to legislation that can cause companies’ stocks to rise and fall dramatically.
How do they get away with it? Simply put, lawmakers have exempted themselves from the laws that govern every other citizen.
‘60 Minutes’ reported that Pelosi and her husband have participated in at least eight IPOs (initial public offerings) while having access to information directly relating to the companies involved. One of those came in 2008, from Visa, just as a troublesome piece of legislation that would have hurt credit card companies, began making its way through the House.
“Undisturbed by a potential conflict of interest Pelosi and her husband purchased 5,000 shares of Visa at the initial price of $44 dollars.
Two days later it was trading at $64. The credit card legislation never made it to the floor of the House,” 60 Minutes" reported.
The Hoover Institution’s Peter Schweizer stressed that what Pelosi did was absolutely, 100 percent legal.
“There are all sorts of forms of honest grafts that congressmen engage in that allow them to become very, very wealthy.
So it's not illegal, but I think it's highly unethical, I think it's highly offensive, and wrong,” he told Kroft.
Following the “60 Minutes” report, Pelosi’s office issued a statement saying, “It is very troubling that ‘60 Minutes’ would base their reporting off of an already-discredited conservative author who has made a career out of attacking Democr.Montgomery real estate agent Derek Tye flies his drone helicopter with a GoPro camera attached around a property he is selling on Deerfield Road.

Closer from upcoming EP, self-released by Chicago band in April
Photograph courtesy of Zoran Orlic
Post-punk Chicago-based four piece Disappears are set to follow last year's Pre-Language album with a self-released EP, Kone, on April 16, and we've got a first listen of the closer 'Kone (Edit)':
The track opens with guitars meshing over distant, ringing feedback. One sends up flares of tremolo, while another planes across the stereoscope, forging a steely drone, massing until a syncopated rhythm kicks in. Frontman Brian Case's vocals play out as echoed howls over a circular, sparse post-punk core, one which feels like it's barely keeping a torrent of motorik fury at bay. As the track closes, the dissonant noise rears up again, only this time its a controlled feedback-storm, eventually coming into its own as the other instruments fall out, leaving it hanging there, a quivering, metallic spectre. It's an incantatory, long-form cut, and one that promises big things from the band's next album, due later in the year.

Takashi Tsukamoto resigned as chairman of Mizuho Financial Group Inc. after Japan’s third- largest lender was penalized over loans to criminal groups for the second time in three months.
Mizuho Financial Group Inc.’s President Yasuhiro Sato will give up six months of pay for failing to stop loans made to criminal groups as Japan’s third- biggest bank awaits further penalties from regulators.
Takashi Tsukamoto will step down as chairman of Mizuho Financial Group Inc. after regulators ordered a second round of penalties at Japan’s third-largest bank for making loans to criminal groups.
Mizuho Financial Group Inc.’s investigators said a probe into loans made to gangsters uncovered a failure in internal controls rather than efforts by Japan’s third-largest bank to deliberately mislead regulators.
Mizuho Financial Group Inc. cut pay for President Yasuhiro Sato and said the chairman of its lending unit will step down after Japan’s third-biggest bank by market value failed to address loans made to crime groups.
Mizuho Financial Group Inc. may cut pay and add new board members to mollify investors, lawmakers and regulators after failing to end loans to crime groups in the biggest scandal of President Yasuhiro Sato’s two-year tenure.Sorry, this item is currently

- Subject: BULLETIN: First Images from the SOHO Spacecraft - Status Report
- From: Cary Oler <oler@holly.cc.uleth.ca>
- Date: Wed, 14 Oct 1998 02:38:20 -0600 (MDT)SOHO SPACECRAFT STATUS REPORT First Images Look GREAT !! 14 October 1998 The Solar and Heliospheric Observatory (SOHO) spacecraft is performing above expectations since control of the spacecraft was recently regained. Recommissioning activities for the numerous scientific instruments are continuing and will persist through the remainder of October. Over the weekend and today, the MDI/SOI (Michelson Doppler Imager/Solar Oscillations Investigation) instruments and the LION (Low Energy Ion and Electron Instrument) sensor on the COSTEP (Comprehensive Suprathermal and Energetic Particle Analyzer) instrument were all successfully switched on yesterday and today. Yesterdays first-light images from the MDI instrument showed a notable blotchy pattern that was assumed to be related to non-thermal equilibrium in the MDI filter. Today, the filter reached equilibrium and new imagery from MDI show practically no trace of the blotchiness observed yesterday. One of the most significant (and worrisome) events occurred today: the activation and recommissioning of the EIT (Extreme ultraviolet Imaging Telescope) instrument. EIT was successfully turned on today (13 October) and four images from each of the four extreme ultraviolet wavelengths were successfully obtained. An examination of the images revealed excellent image quality. It appears the CCD detector has actually benefited from the 3 month bakeout that occurred when the spacecraft lost control. Current FULL-RESOLUTION imagery is now being released in honour of the spacecrafts second year of operation. The imagery may be obtained at: Please note that these images are not true with respect to the Sun's north and south pole. The orientation of the spacecraft has not yet been trimmed so that these sensors see the Sun's north pole at the top of the image (as was the case prior to the spacecraft problem). In these images, the northern solar pole is more nearly toward the lower-right side of the image frames while the eastern limb is toward the upper-right and the western limb is toward the lower-left of the image frame. This oddity, which affects all of the imaging instruments, will be corrected when the spacecraft is rolled into an appropriate orientation. The LASCO (White Light And Spectrometric Coronagraph) instrument was also successfully activated today. All heaters, calibration lamps and shutters of each of the C1, C2 and C3 cameras have been tested successfully. Dark images from each of the cameras at 0 seconds and 60 seconds have been obtained. Activities currently in-progress include checking out the C2 and C3 filter wheels, mechanisms and the cameras themselves. This will be followed by checking the C1 mechanisms and camera, and then by a complete calibration sequence of the LASCO telescopes. Not until these steps have been completed will the telescope doors be opened and the solar corona be imaged. The process of recommissioning the UVCS (UltraViolet Coronagraph Spectrometer) instrument is also continuing without problems today. It has been a GREAT day for SOHO! ** End of Bulletin **

> Posted by Sonja Kelly, Fellow, CFI
In 2013, Elisabeth Rhyne was asked what she was particularly excited about as she looked forward to the future of financial inclusion. Her response? “A second data point.”
Well, now we have that second data point. The 2014 Global Findex reports that 62 percent of people in the world have a bank or mobile money account, up from 51 percent in 2011, and those two points describe a line. Simply projecting that line forward takes the world to about 83 percent of people with accounts by the year 2020. But of course, that’s not the whole story…
The Global Findex encouragingly articulates some concrete steps that governments and providers can take to accelerate progress toward financial access. I would venture to guess that these steps would bridge the gap between the projected 83 percent and the full 100 percent by 2020 (you can read about the World Bank’s goal of universal access by 2020 here).
So let’s just assume that universal access will be a reality by 2020. We can envision a world in the near future where people receive wages, government payments, and remittances into their bank accounts. Businesses spend less on payroll and have fewer risks than if they paid out in cash. Governments avoid corruption associated with social benefit payments by having a cheaper G2P system that entails fewer human intermediaries. Remittances are cheap—or even free—and go directly into the recipient’s bank account. Cause for celebration, right?
Well, yes, but not so fast.

Somalia is facing another potentially life-threatening drought. Aid agencies in East Africa indicate a strong possibility that drought in 2014 will be as severe as that of 2011, which resulted in the deaths of about 260,000 people. But this year, Somalia’s people may not be able to count on a trusted lifeline in times of drought: remittances from the United States and other countries. Remittances from the United States to Somalia are responsible for roughly $214 million annually, but increasingly, U.S. regulators are imposing a string of service provider shutdowns. If these services are constrained, the effects of a drought on Somalis will likely be exacerbated.
The reason for this challenge for cash flows between friends and family across the Somali diaspora? Regulatory issues centering on the risk of these remittances funding potentially dangerous individuals. In 2011, for example, two Somali-Americans from Rochester, Minnesota were convicted of supplying cash to the terrorist group al-Shabab. Such incidents prompt often sweeping regulatory action and/or preemptive actions by banks to avoid transactions involving Somalia. Danielle Piskadlo, Manager, Investing in Inclusive Finance, CFI.

Voters in Maine, Maryland and Washington approved the legalization of same-sex marriage in their states. In addition, voters in Minnesota rejected a state constitutional amendment to define marriage as an opposite-sex union. The outcome of these referendums adds complexity to the options and obligations of employers in providing benefits for employees’ same-sex spouses and partners.
Same-sex marriage is already legal in Massachusetts (2004), Connecticut (2008), Iowa (2009), Vermont (2009), New Hampshire (2010) and Washington, D.C. (2010). In addition, California continues to recognize same-sex marriages that were performed between June 16 and November 4, 2008, the period in which same-sex marriage was legal in California.
Maryland
On November 6, 2012, Maryland and Maine (as described below) became the first states to legalize same-sex marriage by popular vote. All other states that previously legalized same-sex marriage have done so through either legislation or court order. Voters upheld a same-sex marriage law enacted by the Maryland legislature earlier in 2012. The law allows same-sex couples in Maryland to marry beginning January 1, 2013. The law replaces an existing state law defining marriage as an opposite-sex union.
Maryland already recognizes domestic partnerships for same-sex couples whose relationship meets certain statutory requirements. But domestic partners in Maryland are entitled to only limited rights and obligations under state law, including the ability to make medical and burial decisions, and exemption from state inheritance taxes. In contrast, same-sex spouses in Maryland will be entitled to full spousal-equivalent rights under state law.
Washington
Washington voters also upheld the same-sex marriage law enacted by their state legislature earlier in 2012. The law would have taken effect 90 days after the close of the state legislature’s session earlier this year, but was put on hold pending the outcome of the voter referendum. The state has not yet confirmed when the law will take effect now that it has been upheld by voters. The law will replace an existing state law defining marriage as an opposite-sex union.
Washington began recognizing domestic partnerships in 2007. A law enacted in 2009 extended all of the rights and benefits of marriage under state law to same-sex domestic partners registered with the state. The extension of these rights to domestic partners presumably no longer will be necessary once same-sex marriage becomes legal in Washington.
Maine
Maine (along with Maryland, as described above) became one of the first states to legalize same-sex marriage by public vote when voters passed a pro-marriage referendum on November 6,. Same-sex spouses in Maine will be entitled to full spousal-equivalent rights.
Minnesota
Voters in Minnesota rejected an amendment to their state constitution to define marriage as an opposite-sex union. Minnesota is the first state in which voters have rejected an amendment to the state constitution to ban same-sex marriage; voters in 30 other states have approved similar amendments over the past 15 years. Despite the outcome of the voter referendum, a state law banning same-sex marriage continues to prohibit same-sex couples from marrying in Minnesota.
Federal Law
The federal Defense of Marriage Act (DOMA) defines “marriage” as a legal union between one man and one woman as husband and wife for all purposes of federal law. DOMA defines “spouse” as a person of the opposite sex who is a husband or wife and provides that states are not required to recognize same-sex marriages performed in other states. Several recent court decisions have questioned the constitutionality of DOMA. Most recently, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit found DOMA unconstitutional under the equal protection clause of the U.S. Constitution in Windsor v. United States. Seven federal courts have now ruled that DOMA is unconstitutional; three of these decisions have been appealed to the Supreme Court of the United States. Pending the ultimate review of these decisions by the Supreme Court, DOMA is still in effect and marriage continues to be defined as an opposite-sex union for all purposes of federal law, although the federal government has announced its refusal to defend part of DOMA.
Next Steps for Employers
The rapid developments in state laws recognizing marriage and other forms of same-sex unions can be confusing for employers providing benefits to employees’ same-sex spouses and partners. Employers should review their employee benefit plans and consider whether any plans and procedures need to be updated to address the conflicting state law approaches to the recognition of marriages and other forms of same-sex unions. Additionally, for those employers that have employees who work (or live) in jurisdictions that have legalized same-sex marriage, they should expect to see an increase in requests for spousal benefit coverage from employees who have legally married their same-sex partners.Love you too!

Need style advice? Make a date with a ModStylist »A new Batman Beyond series! I used to love the cartoon, so I was excited to see a new series that I could easily jump into. Batman Beyond Universe begins a year after “Joker Night” which is available in Batman Beyond: 10,000 Clowns. For those of you unfamiliar with the Batman Beyond series, in short, it takes place in the future. The cartoon series pilot began in the year 2019 with an aging Bruce Wayne as Batman, not quite able to keep up with the battles anymore. The series then moves forward to 2039 and now sits in the 2040’s. Terry McGinnis joins forces with the old Bruce Wayne and becomes Batman. The new Batman suit implores new technology like a cloaking device, night vision and rocket boosters.
This issue, as I noted, picks up after “Joker Night” . Batman Beyond Universe #1 eludes to events that occur in that story, so it’s definitely something I want to pick up. The first issue in this new series is a lot of fun. It was exciting to get back into this universe, where I haven’t been in nearly a decade. If anything, reading this issue just made me want to go out and pick up the cartoon series on DVD. Nether the less, I like this issue and the story is it beginning. We get to see old Bruce Wayne and Barbra Gordon, as well as a couple other exciting character additions. Kyle Higgins’ writing is solid with smooth dialogue that is easy to follow. This is tricky because many of the character speaking are doing so over headsets or phones and are not actually pictured in the comic book cell. As a new #1 issue, this Batman Beyond Universe spends some additional time on the characters. We get introductions to the primary characters, ensuring that we know who is who. Higgins also makes it a point to ensure that this series is not a break from previous Batman Beyond canon but instead, is just a continuation of where “Joker Night” left off.
The end of the issue also includes a cool side story of Justice League Beyond (A.K.A. JLB) which is the futuristic Justice League that includes several new characters along with our legendary hero, Superman. The side story reminds me of the Shazaam story DC did with the new Justice League series in The New 52. I’m very curious how that story will pan out and am excited for the next issue.
The illustrations are a lot of fun. Thony Silas and Andrew Elder do a fantastic job of bringing the look and feel of the cartoon series into Batman Beyond Universe. The primary characters look exactly how I remember them which is reassuring and also brings in a sense of nostalgia. The only negative I have for this issue surrounds the action sequences. In scenes where physical confrontations are occurring, I found myself a little unclear as to what exactly was happening in each frame. This is something that is not uncommon in comic books, so it’s not a make or break situation but I’m hoping that as the series continues, Elder and Salis will ease into their roles more smoothly.
Overall, I like this new series and am excited to get back into the Batman Beyond time frame. I’m a little disappointed that some of the story relies on events that occurred in other publications not because I don’t want more to read but because I wasn’t aware of their connection prior to Batman Beyond Universe #1 being released. I am now going to check out Batman Beyond: 10,000 Clowns, which is a graphic novel, and Batman Beyond 2.0. Both are referenced in this issue and I’m curious how deeply the stories are tied together. Hopefully I’ll be able to knock them out before next month’s issue and I’ll have a better understanding of Batman Beyond Universe.Thread

Synovial Cyst Surgery
Hi all ....
Hope this information can be of value to others! This is a follow up regarding my synovial cyst removal. If you have experienced a synovial cyst ... you know the pain associated! To rid you of much of the pain this is the process I took...
Had an MRI on June 25th; it revealed the 8CM round cyst at the L4/L5. The cyst was inside my thecal sac, pressing on the nerves that run down my right leg. Met with a neurosurgeon on July 8th. He explained the surgery and recovery process.
SURGERY: Was a 4-5 hour process. No Fusion of Discs! They make a 2-4 inch incision along the vertebrae. Drill a small hole in the vertebrae & make an incision in the thecal sac. This reveals the cyst. They removed the cyst, cauterize the thecal sac and close it all up. Please DO NOT let this process intimidate you... It sounds like a lot to us but I am under the impression that to a Neurosurgeon it is routine stuff!
RECOVERY: Had the cyst removed at 7:30 am on July 15th. Woke up in recovery with tears of JOY, as it was the first time in 3 - 4 months that my right leg was not screaming!! Got into my hospital room at about 1 pm and took my first walk at about 2 pm. AMAZING! It felt as though God had done a miracle right in my body!!
Not gonna lie, RECOVERY was a bit painful but without the horrible leg pains it was manageable. The 3 hr. ride home from the hospital the next day was the worst! They offered to keep me for another day but I am very short legged and the hospital beds, chairs and toilets were so HIGH! (Instead of turning around, stretching up to the toilet seat then trying to get off... I straddled the seat like a horse saddle, sitting backwards! It worked SO MUCH better!) I felt it would be easier at home as most of my furniture and fixtures are located just a little closer to the floor and my legs did not have to dangle to reach the floor. Forced myself to walk, no lifting over 10 pounds, limited bending and stretching. I have been very careful on stairs as the right leg is experiencing some muscle weakness. By July 20th I was off the pain meds with the exception of a half dose before so I would be sure to sleep through most of the night. Taking my "go to" pain reliever Ibuprofen in-between to help minimize swelling and soreness at the incision site. Naps and my ice pack helped also...
July 26th I had my stitches removed and left for a business seminar. My husband drove most of the 950 miles and we took lots of breaks so I could stretch my legs. The business seminar entailed a lot of walking and stair climbing. I had to leave meetings early to ice my back and took it as slow and easy as possible. July 31st we drove the 950 miles home.
Currently, taking a couple of days to allow my body to catch up, as a business seminar was probably NOT the recommended thing to do that soon after surgery. HOWEVER, my Neurosurgeon did know about the seminar, gave me the OK with careful instructions to follow. I have some sensations in the right leg such as some slight muscle thumping in the calf and thigh. Have a little ache/pain in the upper thigh. I believe these symptoms are associated with the nerves waking up and working properly. Most likely there is a little muscle weakness that when strengthened will subside. Still icing, napping and taking about 600-800 mg of Ibuprofen. (Prior to surgery 2400-3600 mg a day was the norm! For some reason, nothing else seemed to touch the pain!)
Have a six-week follow up with the Neurosurgeon on August 24th and I'm expecting a FULL OUT recovery!!!
Praising God!! AND hoping this post reassures and helps others in pain. I think I need to change my log in name to "GOT A GRIP"!!!

Lawrence's two murder trials is set to begin at 2 p.m. today, Tuesday, Dec. 10, but a judge first will have to decide whether to grant Lawrence a separate trial from his remaining co-defendant.
A prosecutor and the attorneys representing the 24-year-old Lawrence and Rico A. Saldana are scheduled to begin jury selection at 2 p.m. to settle on a 14-person panel that will decide if the two defendants are guilty or not guilty of first-degree premeditated murder in the Aug. 29, 2012, drive-by shooting death of 6-year-old Lay'la Jones.
Saginaw County Circuit Judge Darnell Jackson will preside over the trial, but before jury selection, he is scheduled to rule on a motion filed by Lawrence's attorney, William White, seeking separate trials for Lawrence and Saldana.
White on Dec. 2 filed the motion, and asked the judge to separate the trials because the defendants will be presenting differing versions of the events.
The attorney wrote that. Lawrence's “theory,” White wrote, is that “although (Lawrence) was in the car, he did not shoot out of the car nor was he aware that any other occupant of the car would start shooting out of the car.”
In his response, Saginaw County Assistant Prosecutor A. George Best, who is trying the case, pointed out that while White filed a sworn affidavit regarding his understanding of the theories, Lawrence himself did not file one. Such an affidavit from a defendant generally is required for such motions.
Best also noted there are “no allegations of which defendant (if either) will testify or what they will say,” which the prosecutor argued is necessary to show the defendants will have “antagonistic defenses,” another element generally required for such motions.
One factor the judge must consider, Best wrote, is the “potential drain on the parties' resources.”
A second and third trial in the Jones homicide — Levonne J. Greer, a co-defendant of Lawrence and Saldana, already is serving life without parole for a first-degree murder conviction — would be “a tremendous waste of the limited resources of the taxpayers of this county,” Best wrote.
Additionally, Best wrote, “forcing the mother of the deceased (who now lives and is employed in another state) and other witnesses to disrupt their lives three times for the same case is outrageous.”
Continuing his argument regarding a lack of affidavit from Lawrence, Best wrote that after police arrested Lawrence in late August after an FBI-coordinated, nationwide manhunt, Lawrence told investigators, “I don't know what happened there.”
“At best,” Best wrote, “Lawrence's attorney has a 'theory of the case' that does not fit with the evidence that now exists.”
A fourth co-defendant, a 21-year-old man, has testified multiple times, including at Lawrence's preliminary hearing, that he was in.
Jackson earlier this month was to rule on a change of venue motion that White filed, but the attorneys and judge were able to resolve that motion in chambers with Jackson telling them he would conduct jury selection the same as it was for the trial of Kenneth T. Bluew, a former Buena Vista Township police officer who killed Jennifer Webb in August 2011 and also had sought a change of venue.
Jackson also presided over that trial. Rather than order Bluew's trial moved to a different county, Jackson at the request of Bluew's attorney.
Court officials have arranged to use Chief Circuit Judge Fred L. Borchard's courtroom as an “overflow room” for spectators to watch jury selection.
In addition to the murder and conspiracy charges, which both is facing up to life in prison without parole in connection with the April 15 strangulation death of his Angelica Olivarez, the mother of his now-4-year-old son. A judge last week bound Lawrence over for trial on an open count of murder and other felonies.
Lawrence and Greer remain jailed without bond.

Agustin Aguayo, who enlisted in 2002 during the run-up to the Iraq war, asked the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia to release him from a military prison. He had sought an honorable discharge as a conscientious objector.
Aguayo, who has been held in a U.S. prison in Germany since going AWOL, said he enlisted as a way to earn money for his education. Although military operations in Afghanistan were underway and discussions about Iraq were ongoing, he said he never considered that he’d have to fight.
He faces up to seven years in prison on charges of desertion and missing movement and is scheduled to face trial next month, said his attorney, Peter Goldberger.
Goldberger said he would ask the appeals court to reconsider the decision.
The above is from Matt Apuzzo's "Army medic is denied objector status" (AP) Agustin Aguayo is set to be court-martialed (in Germany) March 6th. This is a talking entry for Sunday night, just FYI. Aguayo has been turned down and now faces the scheduled court-martial but we're still not supposed to talk "impeachment" or even offer criticism. On the latter, Mia notes
Missy Comley Beattie's "The Object of My Disaffection" (CounterPunch):
Respect for the office-don't you wonder about the meaning of this? Aren't you aghast that anyone would have the testicles or breasticles to blast and bash me or anyone else for criticizing the occupier of 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue? Truth is I receive e-mails from people who read my articles and don't like it that I unleash my inner insight and open a can of fury on George Bush. But it's not just the internet responders. I actually know people who can't bring themselves to say anything remotely disapproving of the worst president in the history of presidents because they respect the office of the presidency. Egad.
The.
Yeah, he brags about sleeping just fine, like Bully Mama, no reality or hardship need to touch his "beautiful mind." In the real world, people aren't so fortunate. In the real world people are dying because of123 (AP).
Tonight? AP's count is now 3137. So that's fourteen more and the 'crackdown' (which was never more than a pancea) has, yet again, cracked up. Brian Murphy (AP) reports: "Militants struck back Sunday in their first major blow against a U.S.-led security clampdown in Baghdad with car bombings that killed at least 63 people, left scores injured and sent a grim message to officials boasting that extremist factions were on the run.." In addition, Reuters notes a car bomb in Baghdad that killed two and wounded eleven, a bomb attack in Samawa wounded four bodyguards, five corpses were discovered in Baghdad (on Saturday), three in Balad (on Saturday), one in Suwayra today, and two today in Sulaiman Pak.
That's only some of the news. There were also announced deaths. The US military announced: "A Multi-National Division - Baghdad Soldier died in a grenade explosion in a northern neighborhood of the Iraqi capital Feb 17." And they announced: "Insurgent small arms fire targeted a Multi-National Division - Baghdad dismounted patrol north of the Iraqi capital, killing one Soldier Feb 17. The unit was conducting a combat security patrol on foot when they came under fire, killing the Soldier. There were no other U.S. casualties in this attack."
Dropping back to last week's efforts to sell/spin Iran as the next war zone, the administration found a lot of stenographers willing to repeat the nonsense with little to no questioning. (Proving that the lesson of Judith Miller was no change at all.) From Patrick Cockburn's "First, the US Deluded Itself About the War, Then About the Source of the Weapons" (Independent of London via Common Dreams):.
And other facts that put the spin into doubt emerge elsewhere, such as from Farah Stockman and Thanassis Cambanis' "Doubts raised on linking of Iran to US deaths in Iraq" (Boston Globe):
According to data compiled by the Iraq Coalition Casualty Count, a nonprofit group that tracks US deaths, a staggering 60 percent or more of US deaths have occurred in areas where Sunni insurgents are active. Those insurgents are believed to receive much of their funding and weapons from private donors in Sunni Arab countries, including Syria, Saudi Arabia, and Jordan, not Iran. Only 4 percent of US casualties have taken place in Shi'ite controlled areas in the provinces, while about a quarter of total US fatalities have taken place in Baghdad, where both Shi'ites and Sunnis fighters operate.
That data goes against the assertion on Sunday by a US official that "Iran is a significant contributor to attacks on coalition forces."
And it cuts both ways. From Kim Murphy's "Iran alleges U.S. involvement in deadly attack" (Los Angeles Times):.
If the US can put out unsourced claims, why not others?
Okay, the talking part. Jess and Ty (no links, I'm tired) were replying to e-mails (Jess to this site and Ty to Third) and a number of e-mails came in on that noting they seemed distant or detached or bothered. That's actually my fault. Somewhere in hour two of waiting for illustrations to upload to Flickr, I passed out. When I came to, I crawled into bed. I didn't realize that it was 'freaky' until after I got up a few hours later. (By the way, Jim posted to the first entry today. I was out of it and waiting for Third's links to be available, so he just put those in and posted it.) When I realized there was concern (over the fact that I banged the hell, repeatedly, out of my head when I hit the ground), I called Elaine so she could attest that this is usually how a faint has always gone for me. (In fact, at one point, for kicks -- this was years ago and is not recommended, just something stupid kids do and grow out of it -- a group of us were attempting to pass out. I know Elaine's brother managed to catch me and slid me to the floor, but I know, once I was on the floor, I was banging my head repeatedly against it.) So once Elaine did explain that to me, everyone was fine. Susan and Julia both specifically e-mailed asking, "Is something wrong with you?" so I'll guess that others who wrote today and got replies may have picked up on something as well.
That's all it was. That and being up since six am Saturday morning and still up after 4:00 pm today. My head is killing me (from banging it while I was out) but there's nothing "seriously wrong" as Marcia wondered in her e-mail.
That is why we don't have a note finished at Third. But anyway, that's also why this entry will be a challenge to follow. Congrats if you've been able to. There will be at least one entry (by me) tomorrow and Ruth's planning on doing her report. I was already iffy on the snapshot. If there are a number of things going on, there may end up being a snapshot, but it's highly likely that there won't be.
Jeremy Brecher's "A New Paradigm for Peace in Iraq" is popping up in e-mails. Link goes to Common Dreams by the way. We're holding our Nation stats for next week for two reasons -- one it didn't fit into the theme that suddenly developed for The Third Estate Sunday Review, two, I'm furious, there's no other word. Harvard grads whose parents are 'connected' don't need to be in the internship program at The Nation and that's certainly not how it's sold when they have their hands out (yet again) begging. The internship program is supposed to assist and help those in need get a foot in the door. By it's very nature, an internship program is supposed to help people who would otherwise be shut out. When you're jetting from your Harvard campus to another country, with a movie star, you're not suffering. You have no doors closed to you. You do have a backroom deal going on organized between your parents and the magazine. And that's digusting. Considering how few African-Americans or Latinos ever pop up in that damn magazine, for them to be handing out internships to spoiled, pampered, jet setting children is appalling. (It's equally appalling that someone in that situation would accept such an internship.) The whole thing comes at a time when Ralph Nader just made the point about how elitists some are (Friday on KPFA's Living Room with Kris Welch).
So I've just explained that I am furious with the magazine like never before (and members know I have been the one pulling punches in this community). Brecher may be getting caught in the fallout of my fury. I think the article is a good step, I will say that, it's past time that they talk about withdrawal. I think it's not very honest to, when you finally get around to addressing what Naomi Klein, Sharon Smith, Howard Zinn, Anthony Arnove, Antonia Juhasz, etc., have been addressing all along, play like people are as stupid as your magazine. Nobody is as stupid as The Nation. In fact that might need to be the new advertising slogan: "Nobody is as stupid as The Nation." In a baby steps kind of way, at another time, I could find things to applaud in Brecher's article. Instead, it's flaws are on full display, such as when he talks about the oil privatization in a really superficial way (he can't offer readers the percentages involved that will be going out of the country) and he can't note Antonia Juhasz who has done more work on that subject than anyone else in the last year. So I think the article's pretty much worthless. People are aware of what withdrawal means if, unlike The Nation, they've been advocating it and exploring the topic for some time. If that's not fair to Brecher's article, my apologies but I'm disgusted by the internship program. (And if a spoiled brat is offended by the comments above, in my college days, I was called one as well -- of course, I turned down opportunities and suggested they go to other people -- people in need -- because I knew I already had finanical opportunities that some people will never have.)
That's it for tonight. The e-mail address for this site is common_ills@yahoo.com.

ByPaul KielPublishedMarch 29, 2006, 10:57 PM EST There's no reason to wait around until Howard Kaloogian produces a photo that shows the Baghdad he found during his trip to Iraq, which "is much more calm and stable than what many people believe it to be." You can look for yourself through the photos from the trip made available on Move America Forward's website. Let's see, is it this one, of Camp Victory, where the truth tellers stayed? Or is it this one, of the bombed out Republican Guard palace, hosted on Truth Tour participant Mark Williams' site? Maybe not. Keep looking.Ed.

You, me,and the free world!!
Excellent article - and all true.
Mitt Romney had on stage at his last big Ohio rally none other than Elaine Chao - yes, she’s married to Mr. McConnell who is stuck in the Senate as our standard-bearer.
She was a pampered, spoiled brat as Labor Secretary. She did nothing according to principle but rather according to big-government, big-spending ideals.
Buy American!
Maybe they just turned it around!
What a joke. No, I’m not reading the rest.
Rove is busily taking in contributions to his super-PAC or whatever it is, and FOX / Hannity are still going to give him a platform from which to raise money and pretend to be a conservative WINNER.
Please, please let us retire Rove and no more Bush family for a good long time. We need political entitlement reform. pfft!
Superb article, although I read Rubio as a Bush circle protege. Anyway, worth recycling an old tagline.
This RWR and GHWB personal relationship was also echoed with Eisenhower and Nixon. Not one in eight years did DDE and Mamie invite Dick and Pat to the White House for a private dinner. But GHWB did become emotional at the Reagan funeral. RWR’s biggest failures were GHWB and Sandra Day O’Connor.
The only possible way to save this country is to find out who makes up the cabal that forced Reagan to select Bush as his VP. Then destroy it.
I am afraid there will always be some Republican stupid enough to write this guy a $300 million check.
A better statement of why the Republican party got it wrong:
“.....” Daniel Greenfield aka Sultan Knish
Link to full article:
You underestimate the GOP’s virtually infinite capacity to learn the wrong lesson.
One of the sharpest pieces of writing I have read in a long time. I saved it. Thanks.
Didn’t Karl Rove, Tom DeLay, and Jack Abramhof promise conservatives a permanent Republican majority if we’d just relax a few principles?
Compassionate Conservatism.
Ownership Society.
Big Government Conservatism.
Project for a New American Century.
No Child Left Behind.
Medicare Part D.
Faith-Based Initiatives (controlled and financed by government).
Neo-conned.
Correction here: Pressy Bush got his start as a shoe salesman in Ohio and got the idea to better himself by going East to attend Yale, where he diligently brown-nosed, facilitated, convenienced, and did much service for the rich snots in varsity sweaters. Then he parlayed old school ties into a U.S. Senate seat.
Sequaciousness was a hallmark of both Pressy and Poppy.
And snobbery.
Say "Jeb-Chris-Marco" three times really fast, and you'll get some idea of the breathlessness of the talking heads last week, as they elevated themselves into hyperdrive, "reserving" slots in the winner's circle for the 2016 GOP nomination.
Ping to my last. Sorry to be the bearer of bad tidings, but Karl's already reserved the 2016 nom for Jebby Boy.
” Run another cheerful capitalist who promises to use his Olympics experience to fix the economy, but never really seizes those grievances and goes for the throat?”
Romney brought a cap pistol to a gunfight. Never has worked, never will work. When you run against a thug, you have to out battle the thug.
I realize and I suspect he will destroy Texas trying to install handsome baby Jeb as Governor.
I wish we could send Boehner and Rove off to a deserted island.
We give them a few boxes of tissue and a dry erase board—that way Rove can figure all the variances and percentages for Boehner’s tissue rations. Because you know Boehner will be blubbering.
I can dream...
Wipe out Rove, Bush 1 and Bush 2 from Conservative history, all 3 were nothing more than traitors to this country!
Glad someone else caught this. I understand the desire to see a hispanic surname among the GOP's rising stars, but lets first make sure their surname, and maybe some nice sounding rhetoric, aren't the only reason we support them.
Whenever I hear HW Bush and Reagan mentioned together for some reason I think of the former using the occasion of the latter’s memorial service to make crappy jokes about Millie, his dog.
BTTT!
