"Everything will depend on technological and climate possibilities. We will get proposals from the companies," Novak said.
"We will see how the situation would evolve," added Novak, who is a part of Russian Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev's delegation to the Arctic Yamal peninsula where local gas producer Novatek is expanding liquefied natural gas production.
The Organisation of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and some non-Opec producers including Russia last week said they would curb oil output by a combined 1.2 million bpd.
They are looking to prop up oil prices that plummeted below $60 per barrel from a 4-year high above $85 hit in October on oversupply worries.
Of that, Russia undertook to cut 228,000 bpd.
According to the initial agreement between Opec and other producers, reached in late 2016, Russia also had to gradually cut its oil production, by 300,000 bpd from 11.247 million bpd reached in October that year.
"It was not that gradual 2 years ago, there were jumps [in output reduction] in January because of the weather. We will watch and monitor," Novak said.
Kirill Dmitriev, the head of the Russian Direct Investment Fund, welcomed last week's deal, saying it is conducive with "strengthening of Russia's macroeconomic stability". - ReutersGot given this fantastic book by my wife. It is a very interesting account of the trade in ice from America to rest of the world. This explains why the British are soo stingy when it comes to ice in drinks and why every fridge in America has an ice machine and why us brits like warm flat bitter instead of ice cold largers. Doesn't explain all you can drink soda's though. Well worth a read.
Ice Ice BabySaudi Arabia Country Risk Report
Saudi Arabia boasts a strong logistics sector, particularly regarding the availability and cost of key utilities, such as electricity and fuel, and good levels of transport network connectivity. In addition, the country has the largest population in the Gulf Cooperation Council with high per capita incomes, making it potentially attractive to consumer-facing businesses, such as retail, telecoms and healthcare. The labour market is also one of the most attractive in MENA, boosted by relatively high educational attainment levels and strengthening investment in research and development, although Saudisation efforts are likely to result in difficulties for firms that hire highly-skilled expatriate workers. The over-reliance on oil has become apparent with the price fall in 2020, contributing to strong efforts to diversify the economy to the services sector, in particular tourism, as part of Vision 2030. As part of this, Saudi Arabia has a relatively supportive business environment, with plans to encourage foreign investment. Businesses situated away from the Yemen border also face relatively low-security risks, with efforts to stamp out corruption. However, the Islamic legal system could deter foreign investors and change will be needed to realise tourism-related dreams..Hello everyone! I know I posted this meme just few days ago, but lucky for me, I have a ton of books in store and, also, I am not really in the mood for a review so‚Ä¶. here we are again!
The book community is an amazing place, where you can discover good book after good book. Yes, the community is not the only meaning to discover new books, but it‚Äôs one of the most pleasant and rich. And the additions to my TBR are always a lot when I frequent the book community (blog, twitter, Goodreads or Instagram. On every platform this is the best way to discover new books!) so I thought it would be nice to share some appreciation for the hard work that sometimes promoting our favorite reading could be!
I have to say that I won‚Äôt always be able to say where I discovered all the books that I mentioned, but all the books I would mention in this meme are books that I discovered thanks to you all. It could be a review, a can‚Äôt wait Wednesday, a twit, a post somewhere. It‚Äôs not important what, just know that I have you to thanks to making me discover new books!
This time around I have managed to collect books from different genres, and since November would be sci-fi month, there are a couple of titles in there that made me extremely curious! The first one is Gridlinked that I discovered thanks to Olga. I read her review of the fourth book in this series, and then I just had to read the one for the first book. Obviously they were amazing reviews, and here we are! The second one is Sisters of the Vast Black, that I discovered thanks to Maddalena‚Äòs review. I really hope to read at least on of them in November. I am keeping my finger crossed!
But the other books seems just so interesting too! Unmentionable: The Victorian Lady‚Äôs Guide to Sex, Marriage, and Manners seems an interesting book, and I discovered this one thanks to Jess. And then we have Heart of Stone, a historical romance that I discovered thank to Lisa. Her review was convincing, and last but not least, we have a fantasy! BtB‚Äòs review was enough to pick my curiosity.
And what do you think? Have you read some of them? And which are the new entries in your TBR? Let me know!
Happy reading!

Wow, what a great Cougar of the Month! Congratulations to Max and remember to stay PEAK!VW Golf R
Firm ditches V6 to give new flagship tuned version of GTI‚Äôs turbo. Is it more convincing than its big-selling brother?
With the old R32, more power never equalled a significant performance advantage. But now, there‚Äôs no question that the Golf R is a step up from the GTI. You‚Äôll certainly pay for the privilege, as a starting price of just over ¬£30,000 is a considerable jump up from the GTI. However, the R more than backs this up with big-league performance and a more focused chassis. At last, the Golf has a worthy, if expensive, flagship
Volkswagen‚Äôs Golf GTI has always been a tough act to follow. That‚Äôs why the four-wheel drive, V6-engined Golf R32 never quite established itself as a convincing flagship of the MkV range.
But could the MkVI version change that? VW has ditched the naturally aspirated V6, and instead extracted more power from the GTI‚Äôs lighter, more efficient 2.0-litre four-cylinder turbo. The result is an all-new model: the Golf R.
Fitted with 18-inch alloy wheels, twin central-exit exhaust pipes and striking metallic blue paint, the R certainly looks the part. Indeed, if you‚Äôre a hot hatch purist, you‚Äôll prefer it to its flashier cousin, the Scirocco R.
Under the bonnet, there‚Äôs a highly tuned version of the powerplant from the MkV GTI, rather than the newer MkVI motor. The block is reinforced and the cylinder head replaced, while special pistons, conrods, high-pressure fuel injectors, a new turbo and a more effective intercooler are used. The results are impressive: 265bhp and 345Nm of torque make it the most potent Golf yet. That‚Äôs a major step up from the 200bhp GTI, not to mention the old R32. It sounds brilliant, too.

Crucially, the turbo engine is much cleaner and more fuel efficient than the V6-engined R32. Emissions drop from 257g/km for the MkV to 199g/km for the Golf R. Fuel economy is up around 4mpg to 33.2mpg on the combined cycle for a manual model. Fitting the optional twin-clutch DSG transmission bumps that figure up to 33.6mpg.
The Golf R is a seriously quick car ‚Äì it‚Äôs a clear league above the GTI, and significantly livelier than the R32 it replaces. It‚Äôs not as rabid or unruly as the Ford Focus RS, but that means you can extract more of the hatch‚Äôs performance more of the time.
Much of this is due to the new 4MOTION all-wheel drive transmission, which can send as much as 100 per cent of the engine‚Äôs torque to the rear wheels if it senses the front tyres are struggling. And with new springs and dampers, revised anti-roll bars and specially tuned power-steering, it‚Äôs no wonder the R has a sharper and more direct feel than the GTI. But we‚Äôre pleasantly surprised that this doesn‚Äôt come at the expense of comfort ‚Äì even though the newcomer runs on stiffer, 25mm lower suspension.
Less pleasing is the fact that VW persists in making its Adaptive Chassis Control (ACC) suspension an option on the Golf ‚Äì even on its ¬£30,000 flagship.
Our car didn‚Äôt come equipped with the switchable two-stage dampers, but it still felt spot-on. Whether the R would strike such a fine balance between ride and handling if it were equipped with the optional 19-inch wheels is debatable. We tried the Golf R with the DSG transmission, and although this delivers rapid and tremendously smooth gearshifts, it didn‚Äôt feel quite so convincing as it does in the GTI.
In ‚ÄòD‚Äô mode, the box is too keen to short-shift into the highest possible gear; in ‚ÄòS‚Äô mode it‚Äôs the opposite, as it‚Äôs a bit too keen to kick down.
The set-up is great when you override the automatic modes and use the button-style paddles, but there are times when you would rather let the gearbox do the work ‚Äì which seems a shame in a car this driver focused. It does at least suit the Golf‚Äôs no-fuss nature. Even on demanding roads, you never sense anything unsettling going on beneath you. All you get is a level of assurance and ability that makes the R‚Äôs front-wheel-drive rivals feel a little ragged.
Rival: Ford Focus RS The Ford is as extreme as they come. We drive the tuned Graham Goode version on Page 30, but even the standard 301bhp RS feels as if it would suit 50bhp less power. The Golf R will appear tame to owners of the Ford, although there isn‚Äôt much between them on the road ‚Äì and the VW has broader abilities and appeal.There are a ton of new features at the forefront and behind the scenes in the new SharePoint 2013 Server Preview. Joel Oleson has a great post which talks to his top 10 new features in SP 2013 which I certainly agree with for the most part.
However, for a quick reference for those that just want an overview of What‚Äôs new and different in SharePoint 2013 Server, I have compiled an easy to read list of some of the new and different features in SharePoint 2013 that I found intriguing based on Microsoft‚Äôs recently published What‚Äôs New article with some screenshots:
Social Networking
Enhanced Newsfeeds and Microblogging
Personal and public newsfeeds, where you can start conversations, see activities such as document, tagging, person or site activities and integration with Microblogging which allows anyone the ability to post to a private or public newsfeed where everyone (or people you identify) can view, ‚Äúlike‚Äù, and respond to posts
Document and Site Sharing
SkyDrive like functionality where you can store personal or shared documents, collaborate on documents with your colleagues and follow documents of interest.
Central Sites page
A place to keep track of all of your owned sites and sites you would like to follow across your SharePoint environment.
Central Tasks page
A place where you can centrally keep track of all of your active, completed, or overdue tasks in all of your SharePoint sites. If you are integrated with Exchange, you can see all of your Outlook tasks here as well!
Document Libraries and Lists
Callout feature
A new callout feature has been created in place of the Edit Control Block menu which now has a nice preview of the document you are interested in with extra information such as ability to open, share and take some extra actions.
SkyDrive Pro
SkyDrive Pro is like SharePoint 2010 Workspace but not necessarily a replacement. SkyDrive Pro can run in parallel with the consumer version of SkyDrive and can give you access to your SharePoint related documents when you‚Äôre offline and automatically sync updates to the SharePoint server when you go back online. The big difference is the that it will have the ‚ÄòPro‚Äô features of SharePoint such as social networking, collaboration, search, metadata, workflow and compliance.
Drag and Drop
Using Windows Explorer, you can now drag and drop documents into SharePoint directly
Editing List Items on the list itself like Excel
You can now edit list items on the list itself instead of being forced to go to a list item edit page. It‚Äôs a one click mechanism that lets you edit the list item like a row in Excel.
Web Content Authoring
Retained Pasted Text Formatting
All Page Editor Web Parts, Content Editor Web Parts, and HTML field controls can now retain all pasted text formatting when copying content from Microsoft Word.
Drag and Drop and On Page Customization of Current and Global Navigation Menus
Customize global and current navigation menus by dragging menu items directly from page and edit the links on the page instead of going to a navigation settings page
New Video Content Type with simplified upload process
A new video content type adds simplified upload process with thumbnail previews while allowing you to pick a frame from within the video to use as the thumbnail preview image and embed from online sources like YouTube.

We were in Thailand at the time, on a three-day getaway from our home in Laos. Mike had noticed something different downstairs ten days previously, and we‚Äôd scheduled an appointment to get it checked out in Thailand while we were there (Laos medical facilities are, shall we say, sub-par).
Right up until the day of the appointment, I wasn‚Äôt worried. The chances of it being anything serious are so slim, I reasoned. And after everything that‚Äôs already landed on us in the last two years ‚Äì a baby‚Äôs broken femur, my broken ankle, depression, Mike‚Äôs two herniated discs and spinal surgeries ‚Äì it‚Äôs so not our turn for this sort of medical drama anymore, amen.
I was carrying our five-month old and simultaneously trying to prevent our leashed and unhappy two-year-old from climbing into a fishpond, when Mike walked up to me after his appointment and said the words: ‚ÄúI have a tumor. It needs to come out as soon as possible. The doctor said it could be life-threatening.‚Äù
Well. So much for not our turn anymore.
As we were driving back to Laos the next day, Mike and I began to do something we‚Äôve gotten rather skilled at doing ‚Äì planning for how to deal with a medical challenge in Bangkok while we continued living in Laos.
During that drive home, we decided that Mike would leave ASAP to have surgery in Bangkok while I stayed in Laos with the kids. If further treatment was needed after that, we hoped that perhaps Mike could commute to Bangkok for radiation or chemotherapy and then return to Laos and work in between treatments.
It seemed like a good plan to us. It didn‚Äôt seem like such a good plan to two of our good Australian friends ‚Äì both doctors ‚Äì who are also currently living in Laos.
These two friends came around to our house that day after we arrived home from Thailand. Over the course of the next three hours they lovingly but firmly laid out all the reasons why, given Mike‚Äôs test results, we should all catch the first available flight to Australia.
Forty-eight hours later, one minute before midnight on New Years Eve, our flight from Bangkok to Brisbane lifted off. I believe we were being serenaded at the time by our exhausted two year old screaming in rotation, ‚ÄúCOOKIE MAMA, RIGHT NOW!!‚Äù and ‚ÄúOFF PLANE!!‚Äù
Now it‚Äôs the 20th of January. We‚Äôre living at my parent‚Äôs house. Again. Mike had surgery in Brisbane six days after we landed in Australia. His tumor turned out, as expected, to be cancer. What we didn‚Äôt really expect was for a Stage 3 diagnosis. Lymph nodes in his groin and his chest have already been affected. I‚Äôm writing this article in the oncology unit, sitting beside Mike. The nurses are preparing to hook up the first treatment in what will be at least nine weeks of chemotherapy.
I am so profoundly grateful that we are not in Laos or Bangkok right now, and that our kids are being watched over by their grandparents while I‚Äôm here.
I was wondering yesterday what to write about this month that might be relevant to you all when this question popped into my mind: How will you know when it‚Äôs right to leave the field?
Our first inclination when Mike was diagnosed was to stay in Asia. We only decided to temporarily relocate to Australia because we invited, and then took, the advice of two friends who knew more than we did about what we might be dealing with.
One of those two doctor friends reassured us as we were still trying to process stepping away from Mike‚Äôs job, our house, and ‚Äúnormal‚Äù life for an indeterminate amount of time.
‚ÄúThe specifics about your house and everything else will sort themselves out,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúThey always do. And within six months this will all most likely be behind you. You‚Äôll be back. You just need to step away for a while.‚Äù
What sort of situations or warning flags would make you decide to step away for a while, or even leave the field permanently?
Sometimes we‚Äôre faced with a pretty clear crisis point, like a cancer diagnosis, that raises the question of whether to go or to stay. Speaking as both a psychologist and someone who has been through a couple of those crisis points, I can tell you that no matter how calm you feel in the immediate aftermath of a crisis point, you may not be thinking logically and rationally. Right when you need to be making 101 important decisions, you will not be at your best.
Make up your mind now not to go it alone during those moments. Who will you trust to help you untangle your options and to give you advice? Think now about who could be a good sounding board for you then.
Beyond that, however, think about what sorts of seasons and reasons should cause you to at least consider leaving the field. In the absence of a specific crisis point, we can slowly acclimatize to all sorts of stresses and strains without realizing the extent of the pressure that we (or our relationships) are under. That proverbial frog in the boiling pot of water might have survived if he‚Äôd kept his eye on a thermostat. Along those lines, we should keep some of our own personal and relational thermostats within view when we‚Äôre living in potential pressure-cooker situations. When you choose to live overseas, it‚Äôs wise to identify some personal warning signs that should prompt you to reconsider whether your life overseas is worth the cost that you and your loved ones are paying.
What signs of marital strain would act as this sort of trigger for you? What about issues with your children, or your (or a loved one‚Äôs) faith, job, sense of vocation, or health? Where would you go if you had to leave the field on short notice?
Think about these questions this week. Talk about them with your partner, friends, or family.
I hope you never have to put any ‚Äúemergency exit‚Äù scenarios into place. But if you do, I hope you‚Äôll know when to leave and that you‚Äôll have somewhere soft to land for a season while you sort out your life. On those fronts, at least, Mike and I count ourselves blessed.
Share your wisdom with us all. Have you ever had to make an emergency exit from your home abroad? What helped you during that time?
And, what sorts of reasons or seasons might prompt you to leave the field?

Marketing FINANCIAL SERVICES
The Target
Profile
Salisbury Bank & Trust Wealth Advisory Services serves the communities of NW Connecticut and proximate communities in New York and Massachusetts since 1848. The Wealth Advisory group holds over $1 Billion in assets under administration for Personal Trusts, Custody Accounts, Estate Accounts, and Charitable Accounts.
Challenge
Getting the word out to wealthy families in the 3 states they serve, along with newly relocated families from NYC, while competing with larger, well-known wealth advisory companies is the main challenge.
PLAN / STRATEGY
Strategy for Awareness
1. Research
First, we asked ourselves what search terms our potential customers are searching for online in the NYC area. We narrowed the search terms by their projected traffic on Google. We also researched the competition, particularly what advertising methods and what language the competition was using.
2. Create website pages
Next, we designed the landing pages for the campaign based on our research findings and experience in the industry. In a highly regulated industry, you have a lot of rules to play by, but that did not stand in the way of differentiating this brand. They have a load of talent, who have all come from the big players in the world of banking ‚Äì all here to personally help clients manage their wealth. A brand story like that lends itself to really rich creative, which allowed us to capture and communicate the spirit of the brand.
3. Advertising ‚Äì Print and Digital
We started with a teaser campaign, to engage potential customers. The new campaign was rendered across social media, print and via digital banners. Google ad campaign was also launched. This whole effort started because we kept seeing print ads that didn‚Äôt make any sense (to us), so we contacted the bank and well, the rest is history.
Let's Start Something new
Looks great, right? Imagine the success in store for your brand when you work with us. Connect with us.Electronics can produce sounds quite easily with a few parts. In this bog we are sharing a simple way to create a piano with a 555 timer. The maker designed as well as tested the circuit with 123D Circuits and created the original device. The hardware or raw materials needed in this task include a 555 timer, 8 pushbuttons, a 100nF capacitor, an assorted resistor, a piezo buzzer, 22AWG hookup wire, a 9V battery connector, a solderless breadboard, a 9V battery.
The creation of this musical instrument involves some tricky mathematics. The piano involves an astable mode of common 555 timer integrated with a circuit that will generate sound that drives the speaker. Every musical note bears a prime frequency, it refers to the specific number of times a thing vibrates when it produces a particular sound. The frequency of sound generated by 555 timer in the astable mode depends on the Capacitor ¬© values along with 2 resistors (RA and RB). the relationship goes as ‚Äúfrequency = 1/.7(RA+RB) C. In this specific instrument, the values of RA and C are same for all notes. This means, only RB is left out for producing the sounds. Therefore, you can say that for every specific frequency, ‚ÄúRB=¬Ω(1/.7C x frequency ‚Äì RA)‚Äù.
The way the thing is wired for any specific button RB happens to be the value for all resistors right from the button till the end of resistor chain. You just need to find the correct chain of resistors for your instrument. For more, just check out the image given below:
It is advised to check and try the parts before purchasing them. It will allow you to try various resistor configurations and values before finalizing your design.

My Review:
Lady Gwendolyn Barnes has always longed to be treated as an equal, both in family life and beyond. Her father is a brute of a man and believes women should be seen and not heard. Thankfully, whenever her father wasn‚Äôt in town (which was a lot) her brothers and friends taught her how to fight, and fight well. But now he‚Äôs returned and he‚Äôs more determined than ever to see her married off to an even more brutish man named Gawain. Allen of Ellsworth longs for a place to call his own, a calling and purpose to fulfill. Still quite broken up about his love for Lady Merry, he seeks just that in Gwen‚Äôs village. They meet and sparks fly. But so many obstacles are in their way. Can they find the strength to follow God even when all seems bleakest?
I really enjoyed Dauntless way back when it released and I read it for review, despite my slight dislike for it‚Äôs main character. I had a little bit of the same problem here (Gwen still wasn‚Äôt as likable as I hope for in a MC) but can I say, this was a huge step up for this series! I should mention that if you haven‚Äôt heard of this series, they can definitely be read as standalones, but it was quite fun to see what became of the characters from Dauntless in this book! Merry, Timothy, Cedric, Red‚Ä¶all of them make appearances. And Allen was always my favorite character in the first book, so reading his story was the best part! *thumbs up*
Oh, Allen. If you haven‚Äôt already guessed, I just adored him. üòâ Strong, fearless, faithful, aware of his own faults. He was truly a perfect hero! And Gwen, though impossibly stubborn (you understood why at least‚Ä¶) was a great heroine as well. Her journey was rocky, and I had a lot of sympathy for her character. Even though it was set in medieval times with circumstances not of this age or implicitly relevant to me at all, I still could relate with Gwen and her struggles on a level that surprised me. And that is an amazing display of talent from the author!
If you enjoy fairy tale-esque books, this is for you. Set in medieval times with wonderful adventure, sweet romance, and portraying genuine struggles of the heart‚ÄìChivalrous was even better than the first in this series. Plus, look at that cover! The model portrayed is really a perfect Gwen. A great, easy, and clean YA read good for both teens and adults! I read this one along with my little sister and we both loved it. I‚Äôm just sorry it took me so long to finish it and share with you.
*I received this book free from the publisher in exchange for my honest review.
{Content: Pretty clean read! Only thing I‚Äôd mention is that since it‚Äôs set in medieval times (when women were treated as pawns) there‚Äôs a part where a woman is kidnapped and there is talk of possibly forcing ‚Äúmarital intimacies.‚Äù Nothing explicit, but implied.}

Downton Abbey has given Elizabeth von Arnim‚Äôs novels a boost., Elizabeth and Her German Garden was a loosely autobiographical account of Von Arnim's life on her husband's Pomeranian estate, Nassenheide, and was unusual in the way that the sympathetic female narrator either cheerfully disregarded or, more often than not, gently mocked her husband and family. The book was a wild success and by 1899 it had run through 21 editions. She went on to publish more than 20 successful novels and yet, despite all this, her work now exists more or less under the radar.
However, all this may be about to change as in recent months she has been the subject of a discreet resurgence. It started with Virago's republication of Civil to Strangers and Other Writings, which contains the transcript of an interview, given by Barbara Pym to the BBC in. This Enchanted April was republished as one of a quintet of designer hardbacks with a Liberty fabric cover made by Angie Lewin. Then in Radio 4's Open Book she was voted the most neglected female writer by its listeners. And last but not least, a few weeks ago she even got that fleeting reference on Downton Abbey.
Who was this writer then, so famous in her day and yet only quietly coming into our sights again now?).!

The sale of the helicopter business has cleared the company for takeoff.
The sale of the helicopter business has cleared the company for takeoff.
With the $9 billion sale of Sikorsky in the books, United Technologies (UTX) is poised for growth as secular tailwinds support longer-term expansion in its four remaining operating segments. In selling the helicopter platform, United Technologies streamlined its aerospace business by reducing exposure to a difficult military market and focusing resources on enhancing the efficiency of a component-focused portfolio that derives nearly 75% of sales from a commercial aerospace market enjoying a cyclical upswing.
After nearly 20 years and $10 billion of development, Pratt & Whitney will ramp production of its innovative geared turbofan engine, for which it has secured more than 6,000 orders. Through 2020, Pratt's earnings will be pressured as the mix shifts from legacy engines and services toward the GTF, which records a negative margin at delivery. However, this new installed base will secure a long runway of lucrative aftermarket services that will plump segment cash flows for decades. With the acquisitions of Hamilton Sundstrand and Goodrich, UTC Aerospace Systems quadrupled the value of its content per plane from an average $800,000 in 2000 to $3.2 million today. Industry forecasts suggest that the number of aircraft in service could double by 2030 as growth in revenue passenger miles continues to climb. We expect that Pratt's return to the narrow-body market and UTAS' nose-to-tail systems will take advantage of this trajectory.

Representation is becoming more and more important in storytelling and comics these days, and I welcome it. Characters of all types belong in the spotlight. But like I said in Tuesday‚Äôs blog post, ‚ÄúStereotypical,‚Äù doing so in science fiction can be tricky. Well, there‚Äôs not much of a trick to it. You just do it. The trick is how to do it without being heavy-handed or coming off like you‚Äôre oh-so-tolerant-and-progressive and you should be congratulated for including a gay character in your cast.
It all depends on the type of science fiction story you‚Äôre writing. In an apocalypse or tyrannical society, you probably need to be heavy-handed to get your point across. In a setting where humanity has transcended its intolerance (i.e. Star Trek) you can just go ahead and include whoever you want in your cast of characters without having to point it out. The Millennium Federation is the latter, so representation for us is just a matter of putting characters in panels. We feel we‚Äôve done well so far. Men and women (whether they‚Äôre human or not) have been equally represented in the comic so far, but there have been some tricky aspects.
Race and/or nationality among Humans in STAR POWER is irrelevant. United Earth is just as the name says it is: united. There are no more borders or countries. Humans got their act together and came together as one people. So, while Danica was born in the area of the world we know as Brazil (info you can find in the bonus lore section of THE SEARCH FOR BLACK HOLE BILL), she‚Äôs not really South American in our setting because South America doesn‚Äôt exist on United Earth. It‚Äôs just United Earth. Dr. Brightman isn‚Äôt technically African-American, nor is Commander Landon Chinese, nor is Dr. Venit Japanese, because there are no such countries on United Earth. You get the idea.
There hasn‚Äôt been much romance(!) in STAR POWER yet, so sexuality hasn‚Äôt been an aspect of our stories. Garth doesn‚Äôt even know this yet, but in my notes there are members of the cast who are gay and asexual, but since love and attraction haven‚Äôt been huge story elements, it simply hasn‚Äôt come up yet! Being transgender isn‚Äôt a big deal in our future either, because in my mind the science and medicine of transitioning is so good that it‚Äôs practically seamless. Gender is a whole other issue (for Humans, anyway), but it‚Äôs not difficult to include a gender-fluid character.
Representation is important to us, but we want to do it in a way that 1) is not heavy-handed, 2) is not patting ourselves on the back for being oh-so-progressive-and-tolerant, and 3) fits into our setting. Thankfully, here in the blog and the bonus lore sections of our books, we can be as heavy-handed and full of clumsy exposition as we please..

Legend has it that Nirartha gifted a lock of his hair that is stored in one of the three enclosures. The stunning cliff overlooks a long, wide stretch of beach and is between the villages of Air Satang and Yeh Embang, at the end of a 300m-long (100-ft.) side road. Look for the sign at the turn-off near the warungs.The man in the street could be forgiven for thinking that FinTech is the only application of blockchains, and miss the innovation happening in property, logistics, recruitment, health and general commerce. Sectors where businesses are actively looking to utilize the efficiencies of blockchain technology to reduce costs and improve services.
In 2017, of the monies raised for ICO projects about 30%,[i] went to companies developing applications in finance, investment and payments, significant but not the largest sector to attract investment. The promise of blockchain is crossing into every industry, and this will be case going forward.
Fintech has dominated the headlines in part because there is an assumption that banks and other financial institutions are behind the curve in terms of adoption of new tech. This is clearly nonsense, like for like banks and insurers continually invest heavily in tech infrastructure, true some goes on maintenance of legacy systems but for the most part banks write big cheques to technology companies and consultants to find ways of improving their tech stack to serve customers better. The presence of so many banks on the membership list of the Ethereum Enterprise Alliance (EEA) highlights their commitment to the space and using blockchain technology to develop new ways of working.
The challenge for financial institutions is that they have to deliver services at scale with zero tolerance of failure. It is therefore logical that many prefer to use tech incubators or sandbox schemes to assess the opportunity or pass the research and development risk of building out new services built on new technology to third parties. Once the tech or application is proven they can buy it or licence it.
Moreover, many of the Fintech applications that have come to market are what William Mougayer, author of The Business Blockchain, and recognised investor and commentator would describe as version 1.0 of blockchain innovation. Services that are effectively replacements for existing technology systems such as payments or the settlement and custody of securities. They are not new business applications. For example, a number of exchanges, fintech sites using blockchain technology to settle and managed trades have raised funds through crowd sales and equally have failed to deliver. Hacks, poor security protocols or just plain bad business management have seen investors lose everything. The names of Youbit[ii], others such as Nicehash [iii]or Bitfinex[iv] may soon be forgotten but not for the investors who lost 10s of millions of dollars to criminals.
The market though is changing, for the better. Better technologists and management teams with finance industry knowledge and qualifications are coming into the field - this was noticeable in Q3 2017, and as result better projects are being launched: Modultrade.io, Blockex.io, GBX.gi, AiX.IO, Nagagroup.com etc , that have a greater chance of achieving rates of mass adoption that make them viable business concerns. Companies such as the exchange Quoine in Japan are regulated entities and mark a shift in terms of what crowd sale participants expect: a high level of transparency, in the board, in operations forecasts and business outlook. As well as a sound proven technology that is operationally fit for purpose at scale and not sitting in a white paper as a hypothetical model.
So as 2018 gathers pace, FinTech will maintain its share of headlines but is likely to be linked to true innovations and savings in applications that deliver: ownership and transfer of assets, lending risk assessment and trade finance; applications where the role of blockchain technology is to support the delivery of a good idea and is not the idea in itself.

The product range ranges from creams, tinctures, oils and chocolate to coffee. Basically, CBD is known for its calming effects, caffeine has the exact opposite effect. The question to be considered here is whether CBD makes sense in coffee.
A trendy drink in the USA.
CBD coffee originated in the US. As CBD oils and other drugs became more and more popular, more cafes specialized in CBD have opened over time. At the moment, it is impossible to determine the exact moment in time, the development changed from state to state. However, the Seattle debuts started relatively early.
A company based there called Trichome already offered cannabis-based coffee in 2014. At the time, drinks were still psychoactive as they didn‚Äôt just contain CBD. However, over time, food laws became more stringent, until at some point they could no longer be sold. At this point, the cafe decided to introduce people to the benefits of CBD.
The Gr√∂n Caf√© in Oregon pioneered this movement. This cafe claims to be America‚Äôs first licensed CBD cafe. The facility opened in 2018 to bring people closer to CBD, according to owner Christine Smith. At Gr√∂n Cafe, you must learn to get the best CBD effects.
German companies did not miss this opportunity either. The first cannabis cafe called Cannameleon opened about a year ago in W√ºrzburg. First, you had to write a doctor‚Äôs prescription to get the delicious coffee.
Dance of CBD and caffeine.
The CBD case study itself is full of holes. Accordingly, less data can be found on how caffeine and CBD interact with each other. In any case, a study by the Journal of Internal Medicine showed that the physiological backgrounds of CBD and caffeine are similar, meaning they activate the same mechanisms in the brain. All neurotransmitters associated with the endocannabinoid system are found in reduced quantities after four to eight cups of coffee a day. After using cannabis, the result will be exactly the opposite.
In addition, the interaction of these two substances creates the problem that doses are critical. In small amounts, CBD has a stimulating effect, in large amounts it is already hypnotic. With caffeine, symptoms such as palpitations or tremors of the fingers occur even after higher doses. Accordingly, the combination of CBD and caffeine works differently when taken at different doses.
Fortunately, there are now several case reports to rely on. Drinking CBD coffee is often reported to weaken the effects of caffeine. Symptoms such as palpitations and trembling fingers no longer occur, but the person feels more alert. So, while you develop ailments from excessive doses of caffeine, this is exactly the effect that CBD weakens. This is compared to THC and CBD interactions, where CBD also reduces the worst aspects of THC.
How to make CBD coffee?
Making coffee like this isn‚Äôt rocket science, you just need your favorite coffee and the appropriate CBD oil. Then you simply add your desired dose of CBD to the coffee and then drink. In the best case scenario, you add CBD to the coffee when it has cooled down so that it evaporates as little as possible. The taste does not change much, the coffee is a little more oily and bitter, although this is purely a habit. Flavors or other additives also have a positive effect on taste.
If not, you can also brew coffee with THC, but the process is more complicated and does not require more detailed consideration at this stage. In any case, CBD coffee has been shown to be especially beneficial for those who are sometimes caffeine intolerant. Caffeine and CBD alone have the best qualities.

Abstract: Recent research suggests that gene distribution on chromosomes can be informative about their nature. Consequently, gene distribution analysis may contribute not only to better gene detection, but also to better gene annotation, which is particularly important to high-throughput genome projects. This paper investigates possible mathematical models, namely Benford‚Äôs and Zipf‚Äôs law, to describe gene‚Äôs position distributions on human chromosomes. After a review of phenomena following either of these laws, it is shown that observance of Benford‚Äôs law has to be rejected. However, most human chromosomes display gene distributions which can be accurately modelled by Zipf‚Äôs law. This discovery may impact the analysis of genome sequence data since the proposed gene distribution model could be integrated in software involved in gene detection.

Title: A Hybrid Nonlinear Reaction-Diffusion, First-Order-Hyperbolic System Arising from a New Approach to Structured Population Dynamics
Abstract: This talk considers population dynamics taking account of: (i) population structure such as age, stage, size and biomass; (ii) structure modulated population spatial mobility; (iii) structure modulated population growth including both hyperplasia (population number change) and hypertrophy (individual biomass change). Population structural features are modeled via space/time field variables rather than the traditional approach of introducing structure parameters as additional independent variables. In the special case of diffusive transport and mass or size structure, conservation postulates for these new structure field variables along with standard conservation postulates for population number lead to a hybrid nonlinear reaction-diffusion, first-order-hyperbolic system of PDEs. Results on various qualitative properties of this novel system are presented along with application to an aquatic species subject to harvesting. In particular, the model is used to study optimal configurations for marine protective areas designed to prevent catastrophic population collapse from over harvesting.Jackpot City Casino Review

However, over the last year and a half, many women delayed or skipped their annual screening mammography. This has led to breast cancers being caught in later, more advanced stages.
To raise awareness of this health concern, the physicians, nurses and employees from the MemorialCare Breast Center at Long Beach Medical Center gathered to create a giant human breast cancer awareness ribbon.
‚ÄúWe always advocate for preventative cancer screening, but this message is more important than ever this year,‚Äù says Angela Sie, M.D., medical director, breast imaging, MemorialCare Breast Center, Long Beach Medical Center. ‚ÄúEarly detection remains the key to surviving and thriving and screening mammography is the best tool for the early detection of breast cancer.‚Äù
Long Beach Medical Center patient, Siitia (Tia) Tuaolo, is a real-life example of the ripple effect of delayed screenings and shared her experience during this special awareness event. Tia was diagnosed with breast cancer during the pandemic. She was only 42. She delayed her mammogram and by the time she was diagnosed, her cancer had already progressed to stage 3.
One night Tia experienced some soreness in her arm, which she attributed to a workout. But while she slept, she turned over, grabbed her chest and felt a large lump.
‚ÄúRight before I felt the lump, I was in such a healthy phase,‚Äù says Tuaolo. ‚ÄúI was working out, eating really good; I had even lost 30 pounds. I felt healthy, I didn‚Äôt feel sick, but if I would have had my screening, we probably would have caught it a lot sooner.‚Äù
The MemorialCare Breast Center offers the most advanced imaging technology, including tomosynthesis (3D) mammography, to detect breast cancer in its earliest stages. Tomosynthesis captures multiple images of the entire breast from different angles to produce high-resolution, 3D images, which provides more accurate results and increases cancer detection rates.
In addition, every mammogram at the MemorialCare Breast Center is read by a team of all female, sub-specialized, dedicated breast radiologists, who focus only on breast care. Research has shown that this focus and experience results in a higher quality, more accurate mammogram.
If a cancer is detected, the MemorialCare Breast Center also offers the latest treatments that not only increase survival, but improve the patient experience and cosmetic outcomes.
As the ceremony came to an end, Dr. Angela Sie expressed one final takeaway for attendees.
If you have been putting off your screening mammogram, or know someone who has, encourage them to make an appointment. We‚Äôre here to help women through every step of the mammography process, and if needed their cancer journey.

Living Wage Jobs for Our Community
I believe that Tacoma needs a variety of living wage jobs capable of supporting families. If elected I will work to ensure Tacoma encourages jobs in a variety of fields, and make the process of starting or growing a business more accessible. Working for a locally owned business for 12 years, I understand how difficult it can be to navigate that process, but believe with improvement we can increase the number of job opportunities for our citizens. I am passionate about building partnerships connecting our youth with skilled trades, bringing more mid-size businesses to Tacoma, encouraging our existing business to grow, and improving our permitting and planning process to incentivize sustainable local growth.
Housing Options for Everyone
Tacoma should be able to offer affordable housing to all its residents. I want to increase affordable housing options across the city to accommodate everyone; no matter their age or field of employment. I will work to restructure building incentives so perks such as tax breaks and increased building height limits go to contractors with a commitment to affordable housing. My goal is to define what affordable housing truly means for our residents so we can accommodate our current and incoming population. Having a background in urban planning it‚Äôs important to me that we structure our growth intelligently and sustainably across the city. I will work to ensure that our vulnerable populations, such as lower income families and seniors, all have a place to call home.
Improving Infrastructure
Tacoma is a wonderful city, but as we continue to grow, much of our infrastructure needs to be updated and improved. I will work to upgrade and maintain our streets by repairing potholes, push for consistent sidewalks and crosswalks across our community, and will look at options to ease traffic. Another issue I want to address is our aging stormwater system which is undersized and overflows into Puget Sound during heavy rainfall, washing trash and harmful substances into the sound. I support upgrading our storm water infrastructure and looking at creative new ways to address this citywide and preserve the healthy ecosystems in Puget Sound. I also support our valuable municipal projects and investments, and will work to keep them financially sustainable.
Public Transportation and Walkable Neighborhoods
As a former public transportation planner I want to work to decrease congestion on our streets and keep our traffic moving, along with guiding growth around transit hubs and supporting alternative transportation options. I will work to connect and improve our urban trails network, along with bike paths and sidewalks, so citizens have safe, efficient alternatives to driving. As our city grows, I also want to structure our increasing density around transit hubs to create spaces where people can live and work in their communities.
Bright Futures for our Families
As the mother of two young boys, I want Tacoma to be a place where all of our children thrive. With our city population growing, I believe it‚Äôs important to keep our neighborhoods safe and invest in our fire and safety staffing to keep people out of harm's way. I also support building community partnerships and working to keep information on city projects transparent and accessible. It is important to me that we create a culture where citizen input on projects can be heard, so community concerns can be addressed in a timely and respectful manner.
Homelessness
Currently the city of Tacoma is facing a crisis with an increasing number of residents living on the streets. Last January, I participated in the ‚ÄòPoint in Time‚Äô homeless count where I learned that many of the homeless self identified as having mental health and substance abuse issues, and a good portion of those had been homeless for many years. Among them were families, veterans, teenagers and senior citizens; people just like you and me. I will work towards creating a stable safe space for these displaced individuals with basic amenities such as water, bathrooms, trash pickup, safety patrols, and access to services and support when they are ready to access them. Then the real work begins to address the root causes of their situations. Our homeless need support and stability to get off the streets.
Preserving Green Spaces and Ensuring Tacoma has a Sustainable Future
As an environmentalist I have always cared deeply about preserving green spaces and minimizing my footprint. Tacoma is a beautiful city and I want to work towards its long-term sustainability. We need to support industries that will continue the commitment we have to cleaning up our industrial areas and seeking sustainable options that will improve our local ecosystems. By investing in a sustainable future, we can create more jobs for our community while decreasing pollution across the city. Finally, I support increasing our city‚Äôs tree canopy through the creation of a tree committee to help the city reach its goals of increased canopy coverage. Planting more trees helps increase air quality and supports a healthier urban ecosystem, and will help up achieve our goal of a 30% tree canopy by 2030.

- Sotheby‚Äôs shares jump nearly 60% after report says auction house is set to be taken private
U.S. stocks closed higher Monday on the back of strong gains in social media and entertainment shares such as Facebook Inc. and Netflix Inc., as investors await the Federal Reserve‚Äôs policy-setting meeting due to start Tuesday,
How did major indexes fare?
The Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA, +0.09% rose 22.92 points to 26,112.53, supported by Boeing Co. BA, +2.23% which gained 2.2%. The S&P 500 indexSPX, +0.09% climbed 2.69 points to 2,889.67 as social media, entertainment and real estate stocks rallied. The Nasdaq Composite Index COMP, +0.62% added 48.37 points, or 0.6%, to 7,845.02.
What drove the market?
The Federal Reserve will be the focus this week with markets pricing in more than two interest rate cuts this year on fears of the fallout from global trade tensions and a slowdown in the economy. Investors will want to see if those expectations match up to what the Fed is thinking, though no move on interest rates is expected at this week‚Äôs meeting.
A survey of manufacturing activity in the New York state area showed its largest-ever drop into negative territory in June. The Empire State manufacturing index plummeted 26.4 points to negative 8.6 in June, a record decline. Economists had expected a reading of positive 10, according to a survey by Econoday.
Any reading below zero indicates a contraction in activity. The last time the index was negative was in October 2016.
A reading from the National Association of Home Builders survey for June showed that home-builder confidence fell two points to 64 in June, missing economists‚Äô consensus forecast of a one-point increase. Any reading over 50 signals improvement.
On the global trade front, Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross played down the likelihood of a major deal at the Group of 20 summit later this month, even if President Donald Trump and China President Xi Jinping meet. The most likely outcome will be an agreement for the U.S. and China to keep talking, he told The Wall Street Journal in an interview.
Separately, the Office of the U.S. Trade Representative is holding seven days of public hearings on the Trump administration‚Äôs proposal to raise a 25% levy on $300 billion of Chinese exports, including consumer goods such as mobile phones and laptops.
What were analysts saying?
‚ÄúThe past few days managed little to no real progress for bulls nor bears, and by Friday‚Äôs close, S&P was less than a half point away from were prices had closed Monday. This coming week brings about the much anticipated June [Federal Open Market Committee] meeting, and while a lowering of rates has not been priced in by the market for Tuesday, such a move is expected by July, and failure to do so would be a surprise to markets (based on current positioning),‚Äù wrote Mark Newton, technical analyst at Newton Advisors, in a research note.
Ian Winer, an advisory board member of Drexel Hamilton, suggested that the Fed may cut rates sooner and more aggressively than expected due to pressure from President Trump.
‚ÄúI am pretty sure the brow beating led to the massive about face in February from hawkish to dovish. I also don‚Äôt see how his comments and complaints over both social media and live interviews have no effect on the mindset of [Jerome] Powell,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúI think as we get closer to the election we will hear more of the same..

Many people disregard extra parking or turn around areas. As you pull out of your garage or parking area, try to create space to back into so that you may drive forward towards the street. This space can also serve as extra parking. If you are designing a circular driveway, make it wide enough near the front door so that one car can pass while a car is parked there. The entire width of the circle does not have to be this wide. However, the outside circle diameter should be seventy feet wide. You are probably thinking that this is too wide, but I assure you, it is not..

The veteran Redskins quarterback was a guest of SiriusXM NFL Radio here on Radio Row at the Super Bowl on Friday and admitted he was taken aback by the news of the Chiefs trading quarterback Alex Smith to Washington.
If fact, Cousins heard much the same way everyone else did.
‚ÄúIt was a surprise,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúI was working out here in Minneapolis at my hotel and finished my workout, went over to my phone, had a lot of text messages and saw the news. Certainly hadn‚Äôt heard anything. But in this league and my story, I‚Äôve learned that curveballs come all the time.
‚ÄúI expect to be a free agent come March 14. We‚Äôll see if that plays out, and if it does, it‚Äôs a unique opportunity I look forward to. Haven‚Äôt had a chance to pick where I‚Äôm going to play since 2007 when I chose to go to Michigan State. Looking forward to that opportunity.‚Äù
The trade and Smith‚Äôs four-year contract extension cannot be finalized until March 14, when the new league year begins. But the news sets up Cousins to land the most lucrative contract in NFL history, likely topping the five-year, $135 million contract awarded to Matthew Stafford last season.
This was always a possibility for Cousins, who had already played on two franchise tags with Washington and was on pace to either get a third, sign a long-term deal with the club or hit the open market.
Now he‚Äôs high on the Broncos‚Äô list of possible quarterback targets this offseason, as well as that of other quarterback-needy teams.
‚ÄúAt the end of the day, I want to win,‚Äù Cousins said. .‚Äù
Denver‚Äôs top appeal certainly would be its defense, which ranked among the league‚Äôs top five in total yards, passing yards and rushing yards allowed last season. Thought it lost a veteran in safety T.J. Ward before the season opened and could lose veteran cornerback Aqib Talib this offseason, the group still has one of the NFL‚Äôs top players in Von Miller and a stout secondary. But, barring offseason moves, it also has a pair of 1,000-yard receivers in Demaryius Thomas and Emmanuel Sanders and a Hall of Fame quarterback in John Elway making the football decisions.
Cousins‚Äô ties to Colorado already are strong as his agent is Mike McCartney, son of former Colorado coach Bill McCartney, and the man who drafted him at Washington in 2012 was Mike Shanahan, the former Broncos coach.
‚ÄúCertainly you hire an agent for a reason so I let him do his job. But we communicate effectively,‚Äù Cousins said. ‚ÄúHe‚Äôs done a great job for me. I trust him implicitly. Mike McCartney has been phenomenal since the day I hired him back in 2012. But in this league, the winning thing comes and goes..‚ÄùNews & Stories

May 5, 2021 | Focus on Mental Health | Joanne De JongTwo blocks from the oak and boxwood timber slowly turning amber in the downtown Charlottesville park that noticed one essentially the most violent political confrontations of the Trump period is the tightly-secured federal courtroom the place the origins of the racist mayhem that struck over that mid-August weekend in 2017 at the moment are being forensically examined.
Close to 4 years after the occasion, a sprawling civil lawsuit alleging a conspiracy to commit racially motivated violence in opposition to 9 residents of Charlottesville throughout the white-supremacist Unite the Right march and rally is drawing collectively some of essentially the most infamous figures of America‚Äôs alt-right motion.
The case, Sines v Kessler, alleges that 14 folks, together with Richard Spencer and podcaster Chris Cantwell, white nationalists who‚Äôre representing themselves in court, and 10 far-right teams, amongst them Vanguard America, Identity Evropa and the Traditionalist Worker celebration, violated an obscure federal regulation recognized the Ku Klux Klan Act of 1871 citing ‚Äúconspiracy to interfere with civil rights‚Äù.
A various jury, recognized solely by numbers, has been listening to proof that the white nationalists violated the constitutional rights of 9 plaintiffs who had been left injured or emotionally scarred, and now in search of compensation. Jurors want solely discover ‚Äúa preponderance of the evidence‚Äù to say the defendants‚Äô legal responsibility.
But some of the defendants are lacking, most say they‚Äôre now broke, and a few are utilizing the case as a stage to advertise their views.

The statue of the Confederate basic Robert E Lee, to which the white nationalists rallied, has been eliminated, however political amplification of the mayhem over that weekend, which left a younger lady useless and 14 injured, continues.
Last weekend, a political stunt orchestrated by the Lincoln Project designed to tie Glenn Youngkin, Virginia‚Äôs Republican governor-elect, to the riot appeared to backfire. Charlottesville‚Äôs Democratic metropolis council later condemned organizers for relating to their metropolis ‚Äúas nothing more than a political meme, and parading mock white supremacists around our city as nothing more than political cosplay‚Äù.
But the case and its consequence could have extra political than authorized function. A Democratic lawmaker has filed a similar lawsuit aimed toward these concerned in the Capitol riot that names Trump, his lawyer Rudy Giuliani, and members of the far-right Proud Boys and Oath Keepers as conspiracists.
Yet final week defendants in the Charlotttesville case, some airing intra-white nationalist grievances, others describing Charlottesville as a defensive dust-up with the anti-fascist group Antifa, have at instances pushed presiding decide Norman Moon to rub his eyes in exasperation.

An inexact studying of the US neo-Nazi motion is that those with shaved heads and swastika tattoos you‚Äôll be able to see approaching, whereas the preppie extremists, in fits or uniforms of darkish shirts, khaki pants and New Balance sneakers, are extra problematic as a result of, because the lawsuit contends, they plan forward.
It‚Äôs these of the second order being sued in Charlottesville. An imposing safety element for the plaintiffs and attorneys for Integrity First For America, a bunch supported by George Soros‚Äô Open Society, stands outdoors the courthouse.
That speaks to alarm over apparent contacts between Cantwell, who has pleaded responsible to fees associated to pepper-spraying counter-protesters and is serving a federal jail sentence for extortion, and Matt Hale, the previous chief of the World Church of the Creator, a 90s racist skinhead group. Hale is at the moment serving a 40-year sentence for soliciting the homicide of a federal decide.
Defendants declare the Unite the Right rally and march, granted license to congregate by Charlottesville, was designed to protest the town‚Äôs plan to take away General Lee and his horse, Traveller, from its towering plinth. After a collection of prequel confrontations with Antifa counter-protesters, they got here ready for violence.

But so too did Charlottesville authorities, deploying 1,000 regulation enforcement officers to maintain the peace ‚Äì and failing ‚Äì earlier than then governor Terry McAuliffe declared a state of emergency. Last week, the court heard vivid witness testimony of their expertise of what far proper planners and promoters name ‚ÄúCharlottesville 2.0‚Äù.
Natalie Romero, a plaintiff and the primary witness to testify in the case, recalled that neo-Nazi James Fields fractured her cranium in the identical assault that killed 32-year-old counter-protester Heather Heyer. Fields was convicted of first-degree homicide together with a number of counts of aggravated malicious wounding. He was sentenced to a life time period plus 419 years.
Romero testified that she‚Äôd witnessed the torchlight parade and heard chants of ‚ÄúBlood and soil‚Äù as ‚Äúalmost like thunder. Like the earth was growling.‚Äù
Another University of Virginia pupil, Devin Willis, additionally a plaintiff, may hear the white supremacists chanting ‚Äúyou will not replace us‚Äù earlier than they got here into view in an ‚Äúocean of light and flames‚Äù. He added that the column ‚Äúlooked like a lynch mob‚Äù.
The court heard from Holocaust skilled Deborah Lipstadt, recently appointed a US special envoy to combat and monitor antisemitism by Joe Biden. (Biden launched his presidential marketing campaign with a video denouncing the Charlottesville rally he referred to as ‚Äúa defining moment‚Äù for the nation.)
Lipstadt was requested to establish phrases and symbols utilized by organizers and marchers, some to covertly sign alt-right extremism in on-line boards, others utilizing heraldic-reminiscent shields to sign the bearer‚Äôs specific shading of neo-Nazi ideology.
‚ÄúI don‚Äôt surprise easily, but I was taken aback,‚Äù Lipstadt testified.
But the nationalists‚Äô deep attachment to racist symbolism doesn‚Äôt, legally, at all times set up racist conspiracy. Cantwell had suggested that tiki torches, for use in the torchlight parade, could possibly be bought inexpensively at Walmart. Richard Spencer, founder of the National Policy Institute, a white supremacist thinktank, stated claims that such parades had been uniquely evocative of the Third Reich had been ‚Äúridiculous‚Äù.
‚ÄúThe general sentiment is the mystery and magic of fire and darkness,‚Äù he defined.
Defendants claimed that prejudiced pre-Charlottesville conversations on the coronary heart of the case had been superficial and hyperbolic. Nazi salutes, feedback that ‚Äúportable ovens are where it‚Äôs at‚Äù and different inflammatory remarks is a ‚Äúsubcultural thing of being outlandish and stupid,‚Äù Spencer testified.
Matthew Heimbach, a founder of the neo-Nazi Traditionalist Worker celebration, testified that members of the far proper went to lengths to think about ‚Äúthe most outrageous things we could do to troll and create outrage in the media and get reaction‚Äù.
‚ÄúThey absolutely fell for it,‚Äù he added.
The typically comedic squabbles and betrayals between white nationalists, or their use of semantic decoys like ‚ÄúSee Kyle‚Äù for ‚ÄúHeil Hitler‚Äù, shouldn‚Äôt be misunderstood, testified Samantha Froelich, a former member of the white nationalist group Identity Evropa and girlfriend of its founder Elliot Kline, aka Elliot Mosely.
Even their humor, alternately horrific, grandiloquent and bickering, was a ‚Äúway that if someone were to call you out on it and say, ‚ÄòHey, that‚Äôs really disgusting ideology,‚Äô you could turn around and say: it‚Äôs just a joke, we don‚Äôt mean it. Even though they did.‚Äù
In an trade final week, Heimbach described the suit-wearing, Nietzsche-invoking Spencer as ‚Äúbougie‚Äù.
‚ÄúI kind of always viewed you as a bit of a dandy,‚Äù Heimbach stated.
‚ÄúDid you ever see me wear boat shoes?‚Äù Spencer requested.
‚ÄúNot off top of my head, but it wouldn‚Äôt surprise me,‚Äù Heimbach shot again.
The consequence of the lawsuit could show, like all subsequent motion primarily based on the 1871 Ku Klux Klan Act case across the Capitol riot, extra helpful for getting into neo-Nazi stirrings of the Trump period into the official federal court file than in exacting financial compensation from the defendants.
According to Christina Rivera, co-president of Congregate Charlottesville, a plaintiff: ‚ÄúWe want people to remember that being actively anti-racist and anti-fascist is the reason why we are doing this work.‚Äù
The court has already entered default judgments against seven defendants, together with neo-Nazis Elliot Kline and Robert ‚ÄúAzzmador‚Äù Ray, who refused to adjust to court orders to show over digital units. Authorities have been looking for Ray, described by the Southern Poverty Law Center as a tough-talking brawler, since June 2018.
Andrew Anglin, who publishes the hate website the Daily Stormer, is topic to a $14m judgment for orchestrating an antisemitic harassment marketing campaign in opposition to a Montana actual property agent, is lacking and believed to be out of the nation. Jeff Schoep, former commander of the neo-Nazi National Socialist Movement, stated his cellphone ‚Äúaccidentally‚Äù fell into the bathroom, making it inconceivable to recuperate potential proof, and claims to have reformed his views.
But in a telephone name to the Guardian on Thursday, defendant Heimbach dismissed the proceedings as a ‚Äúshow trial‚Äù. He claimed that attempting to hyperlink Nazi Germany to America in 2017 confirmed that ‚Äúthe plaintiffs were trying to make a Hollywood production out the courtroom‚Äù.
He admitted that these on trial weren‚Äôt a lot of a unified risk, a minimum of, not since they‚Äôd marched collectively. ‚ÄúThe far right is fundamentally ideologically fractured, and can hardly sit in the same room together.‚ÄùSafeTouch¬Æ NeoNatural‚Ñ¢ - 2.4 milRegular price Our Price: To Access Pricing and Wholesale discounts.

Covid rules are to be followed compulsorily in hotels, malls, theatres, and schools. The relief for all of us is that vaccines are available, and many have already taken them. The vaccination was available for all age groups, but there was a concern for the children between 5-12 years.
cnbc.com
Pfizer-BioNTech announced that its vaccine is safe and effective for young kids. The good news is that the FDA has approved Pfizer for children between 5-12 years. It is a great sigh of relief for all the parents of this particular age group.
According to the New York Times, the countries with the lowest adult vaccination rates recorded the highest number of cases, with almost 30,000 children hospitalized due to COVID-19 in August.
Pfizer CEO Albert Bourla says, ‚Äúwe are eager to extend the protection afforded by the vaccine to this younger population.‚Äù
nytimes.com
Doses to children were one-third the size of adult doses, given in two doses spaced at three weeks. There were few similar side effects in young children as in young adults. The FDA was under pressure to authorize vaccines for kids.
It had approved the Pfizer vaccine for kids 12 to 15 in May 2021, two months after the drug company submitted trial results to the agency. Pfizer also states that vaccines will be available for age groups below five years once we get the results later this year.Your social life and love life are your priorities.

You're trying to find time for your partner. You're living at a hundred miles an hour. You might make plans for a romantic weekend together.
The past might come knocking at your door and interrupt your solitude. You may have to make a choice. Be careful and think clearly.
You're very attractive, and not just to your partner. This might cause some trouble. Mars in Leo might make it tempting to stray from the righteous path.

AKRON
Akron (0-1) looks to turn the page on a 42-3 loss to Illinois as UAB (1-0) travels to Akron for a showdown at noon on Saturday, Sept. 7th on the CBS Sports Network.
After the dust settled on last week‚Äôs loss to Illinois, I tried to make sense of what happened and how Akron might do this week against UAB.
The personnel decisions had a hand in the loss to Illinois, with Akron relying heavily on youth and inexperience. Akron played at least 15 freshmen, including 11 true freshmen.
Eleven Zips made their first career starts against Illinois, not including the punter Jonah Wieland‚Äôs debut, where he attempted seven punts for a 30.4-yard average. Kicker Jerry Fitschen, who attempted his first career field goals, scored the Zips only points going 1-of-2 on the day.
On defense, Akron started at least two freshman defensive linemen and three freshman defensive backs and played other freshman defensive backs who didn‚Äôt start. Not surprising on the youth movement in the defensive backfield, where Akron‚Äôs roster is made up of mostly underclassman.
On offense, the Zips‚Äô right and left tackles Landon Forman and Austin Sample made their starting debuts along with wide receiver Dustin Burkhart. Illinois defense finished with six sacks, twelve tackles for loss, and three QB hurries.
Akron players projected by some media or fans to be starters did not start but did play such as defensive lineman Justin Sampson and Deandre Brimage and wide receiver Andre Williams.
At least three projected senior starters did not play last week vs Illinois, CB Alvin Davis (#9 All-MAC player for 2019), DT Davon‚Äôte Jest, and LT Trevor Brown.
It remains unclear if Davis, Jest, or Brown will play vs UAB.
UAB
Head coach Bill Clark, his staff, and players have simply done a tremendous job in getting the program through the last five years with as much success as they‚Äôve had.
UAB, due to funding issues, did not compete in football in the 2015 and 2016 season. The coaches and players who remained at UAB though, not playing, prepared to win when football returned in 2017.
UAB‚Äôs first year back was successful with an 8-5 record and a bowl appearance against the Ohio Bobcats. In 2018, UAB won the Conference USA title with an 11-3 record and finished the season with a 37-13 win in the Boca Raton Bowl against a very good defensive team in Northern Illinois.
Phil Steele has UAB in a four-way race for first place in the USA West Division in 2019.
UAB won its first contest of the year, beating FCS opponent Alabama State Hornets 24-19.
How Akron Can beat UAB
I expect Akron will rebound week one and show more of what they can be about against UAB.
If Akron is a winner vs UAB, these are some UAB players they will have to keep in check.
QB Tyler Johnston:
Johnson is a dual-threat QB and Akron has to be prepared to limit his effectiveness on the speed option, QB draws, and scrambles. Johnson had 12 attempts last week for 64 yards and picked up some first downs via the run.
UAB is not afraid to throw the deep ball, taking several deep shots last week when it saw what it liked in Alabama State‚Äôs defensive formations. QB Johnson threw a nice deep ball last week, connecting on big pass plays of 37, 28, and 23 yards, all to different wide receivers. Johnson nearly connected on a few other long throws.
RB Spencer Brown
At 233 pounds, Brown is a load to deal with and is closing in on UABs all-time rushing yardage record, needing only 185 yards to surpass former Minnesota Viking sixth round draft choice QB Joe Webb for first place. UAB had to replace several starters on its offensive line but Brown still rushed for 77 yards last week on 23 carries.
DL Garrett Marino
The senior defensive lineman had 9 tackles last week against Alabama State and was awarded Conference USA Defensive player of the week honors.
Akron will rebound on offense across the board this week and its not just that they face a team in UAB who is replacing seven defensive starters: Akron is more talented than what we saw last week.
The offensive line should play better this week, especially if Trevor Brown returns.
I expect QB Kato Nelson will have more time to throw and will find emerging wide receiver Nate Stewart and Jeremiah Knight with more regularity.
Prediction:
UAB 34, Akron 23Super Tuesday is almost upon us, and if you have not already cast your ballot, this is your last chance.
Expect long lines at the polls, if early voting was any indication.
56,120 Denton County residents voted early this year, more than double the number of early voters in any prior election.
The primary election will determine which candidates will appear on the ballot as the nominees from the Republican and Democrat parties in the November general election. Since most of the local races have no Democratic candidates, the primary is a winner-take-all.
Voters may vote in either the Republican or Democratic primaries, but not both.
Besides the presidential race, the Republican ballot is chock full of state and local races, including a congressional seat, sheriff, justices and judges.
Polls will be open from 7 a.m. to 7 p.m. on Tuesday. Voters must cast their ballots in the precinct where they are registered to vote. There are different polling locations for Republican and Democratic races.
Voters will need to bring photo ID‚Äìsuch as a driver‚Äôs license, CHL, military ID or passport‚Äìto the polls.

How can I whiten my teeth safely?
At our dental office in Delta, patients are sometimes curious about how they can effectively and safely whiten their teeth. While we may feel more confident with a brighter, whiter smile after teeth whitening treatments, not every option out there is safe. Today, our dentists recommend ways to complete this task safely ‚Äî and offer some advice on how to maintain your white smile.
Ask your dentist about teeth whitening options for you
As we age, our teeth will likely naturally lose whiteness for many reasons. Based on the current shade of your teeth, the reasons your teeth have darkened in colour and your specific needs, your dentist can conduct a tooth colour analysis, then recommend options you might consider for safely whitening your smile. Remember that existing restorations will not change colour, since whitening only works on natural tooth enamel.
Our dentists at Ladner Village Dental offer at-home teeth whitening treatments that can be used to effectively whiten your teeth. You'll see us for two appointments. At your first appointment, the dentist will create impressions of your teeth so a custom whitening tray can be made. When you receive your tray, whitening gel and instructions during the second appointment, you'll be asked to try on the trays to ensure they fit properly and so any required adjustments can be made.
You'll place the whitening solution in each tray and wear either twice a day for 30 minutes or overnight for a couple of weeks, depending on the desired level of whitening and degree of staining on existing teeth.
Avoid adverse side effects by working with your dentist
It's important to consult your dentist before, during and after whitening your teeth, since everyone's teeth respond differently to the teeth whitening process. This can help reduce the risk of side effects.
Gum irritation and tooth sensitivity are normal during the period in which you are whitening your teeth, but should subside shortly after you've stopped bleaching. If irritation and/or sensitivity persist, consult your dentist.
Avoid acidic, dark-coloured drinks and foods
You'll want to keep your grin looking as white as possible long after you've invested in whitening your smile. We recommend people who have whitened their teeth regrainpastes to keep your smile white. Add these to your daily routine maintenance to remove stains from your teeth. Brush twice daily for two minutes each time.
Dedicate time to periodic touchups
Depending on the nature of your daily oral hygiene routine, effects from at-home teeth whitening treatments may last one year or even longer. Discolouration can slowly accumulate but will not return to its original pre-treatment shade. Make time for touchups when required.
Researching how you can safely whiten your teeth? Contact our Delta dentist today to schedule a consultation.HP Probook with AMD processor

Dear Priscilla Bennett Friends,
A common perception still today is that domestic violence is often considered a personal private problem and shouldn‚Äôt be exposed.
Some attitudes in the United States have changed over the past decades.
The 1994 Violence Against Women Act pushed justice systems across the country to take domestic violence seriously and treat it as a crime‚Äîa landmark victory making it easier for police officers and first responders to deal with intimate partner violence. But a survey of 500 elected U.S. sheriffs found many felt neutral or agreed with common myths about violence against women like why don‚Äôt they just leave?
Another myth is that abusers‚Äîespecially the charismatic and respectable ones in public‚Äîsuddenly snap when they hurt their partners. Research shows abuse is almost always a pattern of behavior. received medical attention for their injuries. Many victims keep silent out of fear of reprisal or escalation. Leaving the relationship is worse. Abusers typically get more violent when their victims leave. Separation is often called the most dangerous time for victims.
Intimate partner violence follows predictable patterns. It‚Äôs almost never a one-off incident. It‚Äôs not a matter of victims provoking their abusers or of abusers being out of control. The issue of who is at fault isn‚Äôt complicated. It‚Äôs always the abuser or abusers being out of control. The issue of who‚Äôs at fault isn‚Äôt complicated. It‚Äôs always the abuser. People are victimized by partners across race, class, gender, education and geographic lines‚Äîit isn‚Äôt a private family matter. It‚Äôs a major public health issue that affects close to 10 million Americans every year.
In my novel SOMETHING TO BE BRAVE FOR, Katie must deal with the fact that her parents will not support her when she decides to leave her abusive husband Claude who controls all the finances. She has to find a way to freedom with her child without reporting it to the police. Claude, the famous plastic surgeon, would pay them off, and Katie would suffer further brutality with the fear she wouldn‚Äôt survive.
Take good care of yourselves,

Static web design is a type of web design in which the web is implemented solely using HTML and CSS. And the website is not connected to a database for reading content. A static website does not have a control panel for managing website content. And only a web designer can make the necessary changes to a website. The era of static website design is now over. A dynamic website, on the other hand, communicate with the database through server-side programming languages. And stores the necessary information in the database and collects it from the database.
Dynamic website also has a control panel through which you can manage the content of the website. There are several server-side programming languages for communicating with the database, one of which is PHP. PHP is more popular for implementing sites due to its open-source nature.
Today, a very high percentage of sites are run by the PHP programming language. Open source means that a large user community is trying to develop PHP for free. And each member of this user community uses the facilities created to implement their website. PHP site design is very common today. Because the speed of implementing the website is higher and the cost of designing the site with PHP is lower than other methods.
Benefits of PHP Training:
PHP + has an Embed property, meaning that php code can also be placed between html tags, it can also be said to be a scripting language.
Php + can be written both procedurally and object-oriented

Communication-based Train Control System Market to Witness Rise in Demand of CBTC Systems for Metro Trains during 2021-2031
- Oct-2021
- List of Tables : 60
- List of Figures : 101
- 170 Pages
- Technology
Market Snapshot
According to the communication-based train control (CBTC) system market analysis by Fact.MR, communication-based train control systems for train hold more than 45% market share, which is estimated to be valued at US$ 24.5 Bn by 2031. CBTC system demand is estimated to surge at the rate of 11.5% CAGR and create a value of around US$ 10.4 Bn by 2031.
Revenue from Communication-based train Control Systems from 2016 to 2020 Compared to Demand Outlook for 2021 to 2031
CBTC systems consist of ATS (automatic train supervision), ATO (automatic train operation), and ATP (automatic train protection) systems that make a train fully automatic and driverless.
Rail accidents is the prime reason for the adoption of CBTC systems, and in terms of accidents, according to the International Union of Railways, Europe is the leading region with 58% or 6,239 rail accidents over the last two decades, followed by Africa with 29% or 3,048 rail accidents. In 2019, more than 60% of rail accidents in Norway occurred due to rail collisions.
However, the above-mentioned facts are evident to understand the sensitivity of traditional train control systems. Communication-based train control systems are smart enough to reduce accidents by almost 99.9% and increase efficiency.
Rapidly growing population, rising need for fast and safe commute, requirement of accident-free rail transportation, etc., are driving demand for communication-based train control systems for metros and trains.
CBTC system are expected to capture more than 2/5 share of overall automatic train controllers. Communication-based train control systems for passengers and freight rail systems are widely used to reduce human error and protect cargo and goods from theft. Demand for CBTC systems for subways is continuously increasing, owing to high adoption across developed countries to make their rail lines safe.
Furthermore, ETCS (European Train Control System) is likely to grow at a double-digit CAGR and offer a billion-dollar opportunity. European countries such as Germany and the U.K. are prominent contributors to the market. Also, ETCS is widely adopted in other regions such as South Asia & Oceania and the Middle East & Africa.
For improving passenger experience and reducing the risk of train mishaps in the rail transportation sector, automation technologies have witnessed a strong growth rate over the past few years. Semi-automatic trains or driverless trains are in application in countries such as South Korea, Japan, China, and UAE.
Due to the introduction of sensor-based technology, communication between two radio stations is possible. Sensor-based technology is anticipated to eliminate human errors associated with data interpretation and accurately respond to signals coming from wayside systems. Due to this fact, integration of sensor-based technology in railways is likely to reduce the number of train accidents across the globe and provide a hike to the demand trajectory of communication-based train controllers.
Global demand for communication-based train control systems is likely to increase at 11.5% CAGR and create an absolute dollar opportunity of around 4.1 Bn during the assessment period.
Will Infrastructural Development across the Globe Provide a Spurt to Demand for Semi-automatic Train Operations?

The first perception of people with the INFP personality type, is that they are more quiet people or even timid, but what‚Äôs happening on the inside is quite different.
INFPs are generous people with high tolerance to other people‚Äôs beliefs, creative and loyal to their values, although at times can be a little impractical due to becoming consumed by their thoughts and passions.
They often feel misunderstood and alienated from other people, this might be due to the fact that there are not many of them compared to other personality types.
But that doesn‚Äôt mean they cannot have meaningful connections with other people, fortunately, they do have an empathic nature and that allows them to be successful in their relationships, romantic or friendships.
They tend to be very honest especially internally, and most of all they value people who are authentic, because they themselves are very authentic, their sense of self is held in very high regard.
What are INFPs Known For?
Their most admirable trait, which is their idealism might also be their biggest cause of frustration and disappointment, seeing that they will often feel defeated or discouraged when people around them don‚Äôt understand or share their same high ideals
They are deep thinkers and focus mainly on the human condition and what it means to be human, as so, they are very attuned to other people‚Äôs feelings. which makes them want to understand the thoughts, feelings, or emotional state of another person.
this insight and sensibility are what allows them to express themselves with great conviction, they can be quite moving their words come out as emotive and meaningful.
Great sensibility, is hard to be kept bottled up, they feel the need to express themselves in a creative way that is adjusted with their more sensible and insightful inner emotions, think of poets, writers, and actors.
Other Hobbies to try
Are INFPs Dreamers?
They enjoy being dreamers, and their minds are found normally wandering and creating fantastic stories and different approaches to ordinary seemingly bland scenarios.
Their powerful imagination is what allows them to have a rich inner nature, and helps them find their place in the world.
But there‚Äôs also a downside to everything that strays out of balance, and if they daydream or fantasize too much, they can spend long periods of time in this dream world and don‚Äôt take action.
They would benefit from being more proactive because if they linger for too long in this dream state, when they finally come out of it, they realize they didn‚Äôt accomplish anything tangible, and this might leave them feeling frustrated and unfulfilled.
INFP Finding Meaning
Having a predisposition to the abstract side of their rich inner world, It‚Äôs imperative that they look for meaning or purpose in their lives, always roaming might make them feel directionless or stuck.
But when they do find meaning, often it has to do with helping to improve the mood and causing cheerfulness to people around them.
Being very aware of other people‚Äôs feelings, they can at times also internalize other people‚Äôs suffering as if it were their own.
But they don‚Äôt sit in a corner and wallow in this suffering, instead they use it as fuel to provide further assistance to people in need.
They are so emphatic that they can fall into the trap of wanting to help too many people at the same time, this can leave them tired and drained, when this happens it might cause them to give up on the whole endeavor altogether and give up on even trying
That doesn‚Äôt mean that they give up on helping forever, they just need some time to recharge and regenerate, their great capacity for empathy and the strong desire to help cannot be held down for too long.
And before you know it they bounce back and continue their beautiful journey of inspiring compassion, understanding, and harmony wherever they go.

30 September 2020
The term three school holidays can really be a blast. We‚Äôre nearing the end of the year, the weather‚Äôs on the up and we‚Äôre on the downhill towards summer. Whilst this year‚Äôs been a bit funky (understatement maybe?!), for those staying local, there‚Äôs a bunch of things to get into at Northlands that can get you into the school holiday groove.
For the super sleuths in the family, Northlands are hosting a scavenger hunt where kids find the letters around the mall and unscramble them to make the secret words. Once they have it sussed, they can bring their entry back to the Customer Service desk (between ANZ and Vodafone) to receive a Mr Fothergill‚Äôs Grass Hair Kit. Super cute, they can adopt a kitten or a puppy; each kit comes complete with seeds, soil and an adorable pot ready to grow their pet‚Äôs hair. All they need to add is water! Find out more HERE!
Hands up who‚Äôs missed going to the movies? (both hands up for me!) üôÇ There‚Äôs a couple of goodies out for the school holidays that could be worth a box of popcorn or a choc top. The classic, The Secret Garden is out now which looks pretty fantastical. Colin Firth and Julie Walters feature along with some pretty fabulous child actors. A great introduction for new fans and a wonderful reminisce for old.
Robert De Niro, Uma Thurman, Jane Seymour, Christopher Walken. The War with Grandpa packs some star punch. Home Alone-ish, it looks like a lot of fun with a whole bunch of laugh-out-loud moments. Perfect for a little mid-week grandkids, grandparents date, maybe. Check out the HOYTS Northlands screening schedule HERE
The vertical indoor bungy will be in residence at Northlands these school holidays. A great way to burn off some serious energy and practice flips, the vertical bungy will be in the ‚Äúcentre court‚Äù, near Lush and Michael Hill.

‚ÄúPrivate conversations ‚Ä¶ are a great complement to the largely public experience on the platform,‚Äù Jinen Kamdar, product director at Twitter, explains in a new blog post.
‚ÄúYou might prefer to read (or watch) Tweets but converse about them privately,‚Äù Kamdar added. ‚ÄúYou might want to continue a public conversation privately with a smaller group, or start one based on a Tweet you saw.‚Äù
With the group function, users can now start conversations with any of their followers. From there, there‚Äôs no need for everyone to follow each other in order to continue chatting. Users can expect a simple notification when they are added to a chat group.

Twitter has been trying to position itself as a direct-messaging service on par with Facebook Messenger, WhatsApp and a hosting of aggressive upstarts.
Also, the company is slowly rolling out a new mobile video feature designed to accommodate all the gifs, Vines, audio files and videos that users‚Äô networks can produce. All users should soon be able to capture, edit and share videos directly from their Twitter app, Kamdar promises.
Twitter‚Äôs new mobile video camera and inline editing features allow users to capture and share videos up to 30 seconds in length. The launch comes as Twitter continues to lose ground to picture-based social networks, and Instagram in particular.
Facebook‚Äôs Instagram unit recently surpassed 300 million active users, while Twitter reported 284 million monthly active users at the end of the third quarter of the year. ‚ÄúNot only is Instagram‚Äôs audience now larger than Twitter, but its users are 1.8x more engaged, and user growth has been greater,‚Äù Citigroup analyst Mark May wrote in a recent research note.
In response, Twitter has reportedly been telling its most popular users to stop tweeting out Instagram links, which drive traffic back to Instagram.
In the bigger picture, analysts say 2015 is shaping up to be the year that social and video truly converge. If that is correct, Facebook and Twitter could challenge YouTube for a bigger share of the estimated $7.7 billion going to digital video this year.
To that end, Twitter is developing a new video ad unit to support its soon-to-launch native video tool. While details are still being hammered out, Twitter is apparently leaning toward a ‚Äúpay-for-play‚Äù cost structure -- a six-second preview video that would automatically play in user feeds, and the option to click to view the entire video.Kenny Jackett believes he has enough quality in his squad and also the right balance to guide Wolverhampton Wanderers into the Premier League.
After bringing in young striker Benik Afobe from Arsenal early in the January transfer window it was a quiet deadline day at Molineux.
Arguably the best piece of business Wolves completed was to keep hold of prized asset and top scorer Bakary Sako.
The powerful winger, linked with several top flight clubs, will return to Wolverhampton later this week after Mali were knocked out of the African Cup of Nations last Wednesday.
That Wolves have coped so well without Sako, having extended their unbeaten run to eight league matches after their dramatic draw at Bolton, is testament, Jackett believes, to the strength in depth at his disposal.
Asked if he thought he had enough quality to challenge for promotion, Jackett said: ‚ÄúI‚Äôm very confident of the group.
‚ÄúUs finding a balance between attack and defence is a big one really.
‚ÄúThat‚Äôs something you‚Äôre consistently looking for instead of at different times saying ‚Äòcome on, we‚Äôve got to stop the goals against, we‚Äôve got to compete better,‚Äô
‚ÄúWe want to be in the games more, which we weren‚Äôt for a spell.
‚ÄúGoing from there, to keeping it as tight and as competitive as that, but opening up and actually dominating the opposition is where we want to get to.
‚ÄúUs getting the balance, the mix of players, pace, ability, goal scorers, short passers, long passers, defenders, forwards, that mix is there it‚Äôs just about getting the right one.
‚ÄúI‚Äôm confident of getting that right.‚Äù
Jackett said he still had the option to strengthen if needed with the emergency loan window opening next week.
But it looks highly unlikely he will dip into the market unless Wolves are hit by injuries to key players.
As a wide man, James Henry was one of the players hoping to step up in the absence of Sako.
And after being dropped to the bench, Jackett praised his character and commitment by popping up with a stunning goal to rescue Wolves a point at Bolton.
Jackett said: ‚ÄúIt was a fabulous goal, goal of the season stuff.
‚ÄúNo keeper would have got near it, it was a great strike and it‚Äôs earned us a point when it obviously looked at the timing of it that we were going to get beaten by the odd goal.
‚ÄúJames Henry has matured into a player with a really good attitude and has fantastic quality, particularly in that right foot.‚ÄùJust Give Me Time

There comes a time in every relationship when a decision to cut ties or take that next step is eminent. even in love, you can often recognize the exact moment something will not last and to prolong the inevitable leads to your, or someone else‚Äôs pain. Even in that recognition we seem to insist in allowing the other more time.Fiber optic communication network has become the cornerstone of today‚Äôs world of information transfer. With the further development of the network and market demand for communication bandwidth increases, the entire communication network to the part between the user‚Äôs last ten km and last km, the network part is also being optical fiber. FTTH becomes an important direction of the development of fiber optic communication network.
FTTH mainly uses PON network technology, which requires a large number of low-cost optical splitters and other optical passive. Optical splitter device is an integral part of FTTH, and with the promotion of FTTH, there would be a great market demand. The traditional preparation of optical splitter technology is fiber fused biconical taper (FBT) technology. Its characteristics are mature and simple technology. The disadvantage is that the assigned ones too large, and the device size is too large, which causedthe decrease in yield and the rising cost of single channel, shunt reactive stars uniformity will deteriorate. FBT technology based fiber optic splitter preparation techniques have been unable to adapt to the market demand.
As you can see from the perspective of development of optical devices, PLC technology has become a mainstream technology for large-scale preparation of high-performance and low-cost optical splitter. It is the use of PLC technology, to produce the optical splitter chip, coupled with the optical fiber array package, complete the preparation of the optical splitter. Its features are: small size of the device, the cost is relatively low, splitter good uniformity, at the same time, the technical threshold is relatively high, especially for production of more than large ones optical splitter, suitable for mass production. It can ensure that the light emitting device miniaturization, low cost and high performance. Analysis of PLC technology, you can see that the glass-based PLC technology has great advantages in terms of equipment investment, production costs, the optimal choice of production required for fiber-to-the-home, low-cost optical devices such as optical splitter.
International, PLC technology has been widely used in the miniaturization, high-performance optical device fabrication and production, in particular, the optical splitter chip. In China, however, the reality is that we have become a PLC encapsulation big country, but is limited to the optical splitter and optical device fabrication device coupled packaging and downstream industry chain, no one PLC chip Health line, PLC core device chip entirely dependent on imports. Which there is a problem that the core preparation technique of the PLC device lies in the outward, this has resulted in major cost control of the device is limited in the chip at the same time, which also led to the lack of technical support further to the high-end integrated chip development, severe hinder the development of our country in the PLC application.
PLC splitter chip manufacturing process PECVD (plasma enhanced chemical vapor deposition) and FHD (flame hydrolysis deposition) and ion exchange. The former two with the substrate material is a silicon-based silica, and the latter with the substrate material is glass. AWG (arrayed waveguide grating) chip production, Silica optical waveguide splitter chips can be produced on silica on silicon waveguide or glass waveguide. Production by ion exchange glass waveguide PLC chip domestic number of colleges and universities have been conducting research and development, technical appraisal sample has been reached the international advanced level of similar products. The breakthrough of the results from the glass material, preparation equipment, process conditions designed to chip a full range of core technology to master the the buried low loss and low polarization characteristics PLC chip core preparation techniques.
Characteristics of the technology investment, equipment operation and low maintenance costs, simple process conditions, the production of optical passive low transmission loss and polarization characteristics with matching coupling of the fiber loss, environmental stability, and manufacturing costs low, very suitable in need of the PLC production line, can be used for producing low-cost fiber-to-the-home integrated optical splitter chip. Further pilot research and development, to solve adapted to the production of core technology, will be able to achieve your PLC splitter chip mass production.
In fact, in addition to the production of optical splitter chip, glass-based PLC technology R & D production environment with a wide range of other potential applications, for example, can be applied to detect the required light sensor.

Sang-Woo Jun and Collaborators Win Best Paper Award for Predictive Maintenance at the Edge
Sang-Woo Jun, an assistant professor of computer science in the Donald Bren School of Information and Computer Sciences (ICS), was pleased with the Best Paper Award announcement at the 31st International Conference on Field-Programmable Logic and Applications (FPL 21). The award went to ‚ÄúEciton: Very Low-Power LSTM Neural Network Accelerator for Predictive Maintenance at the Edge,‚Äù a paper he co-authored that introduces a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) neural network accelerator for low-power edge sensor nodes. The work was a collaboration with ICS graduate students Jeffrey Chen and Sehwan Hong, Diamond Bar High School student Warrick He, and Professor Jinyeong Moon of Florida State University.
‚ÄúThe work focuses on predictive maintenance, where we collect vibration, voltage, and other sensor data from mechanical machinery and try to predict imminent failures using machine learning techniques,‚Äù says Jun. ‚ÄúThe restriction of this particular project was that we wanted to deploy in existing facilities ‚Äî including ships and factories ‚Äî many of which do not provide power outlets.‚Äù
A Tight Power Budget
As outlined in the paper, today‚Äôs Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS), coupled with the Internet-of-Things (IoT), have created ‚Äúswarms of small, low-power sensor nodes communicating over a wireless network.‚Äù The potential of such swarms is deeper, data-driven analytics, but data collection can increase power consumption. ‚ÄúThe distributed sensor nodes that we target run on power harvesters, which generate a few hundred milliwatts of power from the ambient magnetic field,‚Äù says Jun. ‚ÄúAll sensors, networking and computation needs to fit in that power budget.‚Äù
To ensure their solution remained with that budget, the researchers implemented a neural network inference accelerator for sensor data streams that could filter out ‚Äúuninteresting data‚Äù to reduce power consumption. ‚ÄúWe chose a very low power, restrictive FPGA platform (Lattice iCE40), and implemented a neural network accelerator that uses aggressively compressed neural network models,‚Äù explains Jun. ‚ÄúIn the end, the power consumption for the accelerator measured at 17 mW, an acceptably low number.‚Äù
A Young Contributor
Jun highlighted the contributions of Warrick He, a local high school student who had contacted him in search of research opportunities. ‚ÄúWhat he did was, after trial and error, discover that the training data was not enough to properly train an accurate neural network model,‚Äù says Jun. To address this issue, He sampled the input data to reduce dimensionality, explored different neural network model architectures, and used gaussian noise to create more training data from existing ones. ‚ÄúHe created a neural network model with over 90% of accuracy in predicting electric motor failures, which was used as an evaluation workload in the paper.‚Äù
Future Work
In the future, Jun plans to explore other CPS/IoT domains where such a platform can be beneficial, such as agriculture and healthcare. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm very excited about this line of work.‚Äù

Print BackPrint BackIntroduction: Rustic Pallet Nightstand With Lamp
For over a year now I've been without a light on my side of the bed. I figured that after I made my wife her lamp out of black pipe I would come up with something for myself. I couldn't imagine something that i would like that would fit with our taste.
My wife found an awesome blue rusted cast iron pulley from 1905 at a scrap yard and with that I finally got the inspiration to build my lamp for my side of the bed.
Step 1: Materials and Tools
Materials:
- Pallets, about 4 or 5
- 1x2's
- Screws
- Spray Lacquer
- Black pipe with fittings for your design
- Antique pulley
- Sisal twine
- Lamp socket with cord
- Light bulb
- Outlet with box
- Short extension cord
- Spray paint (I went with hammered dark gray)
Tools:
- Table saw
- Planer
- Drill
- Wood drill bits
- Sander
- Steel wool
- Screw driver
- Wire stripper
- Torch
- Grinder/Dremel/File
- Rope making machine (I will talk about other options for this later)
Step 2: Constructing the Nightstand
For the making of this Instructable I will not really give measurements for everything I am doing because there is room for creativity that will fit you and the space you have. I hope that this will inspire you to make your own and change anything that I have done to make fit your personality.
I will give you the overall dimensions of the base nightstand to give a reference for the project. It measures 15"w x 15.5"d x 28"h
I started with several pallets, about 4 or 5, that I dismantled that gave me some wide and skinny slats. I did have some that split in this process so you need to take that into account. For dismantling pallets there are several Instructables here that go into detail that can help.
At this point I decided to plane down all my boards to clean them up. you can choose to leave them as they are if you like the ruff look.
All sides are made up with three boards butted up tight to each other. Cut all the boards to the same width that will add up to give you the desired depth. And then cut them to length for the width (top and bottom) and height (sides).
Construct the top and bottom panels first by cutting 1x2's to the same dimension of the depth of the three slats together and screw them to the three slats making sure everything is flush and tights on the ends. Now cut two more 1x2's to fit the space between the first two 1x2's. screw them onto the other two sides to create a box.
Next screw the side panels on by flushing the ends with the 1x2's of the top and bottom panels. Do the left and right panels first and finish with the back panel. The back will cover the left and right side panels.
If you want you can add a shelf in the middle by following the same steps as the top and bottom panels with only the first two 1x2's as supports. Position and level it at the desired height and screw it into place.
I decided to add a drawer to the bottom shelf and used the same method above to build it. because I used skinner slats I added a gap between some of them on the side panels which helped in the end to give me a spot to pull the drawer out in the front.
Step 3: Adding Lamp Stand and Power
Because this will be a nightstand I wanted a outlet to power the lamp and a phone charger.
I got a basic electrical box for an outlet to mount on the inside of the open shelf. The outlet I chose had not only the common plugs but also two USB ports for my phone charger. It was a 3.5 amp port. This is a bigger outlet depth wise so I need to grind down some plastic on the electrical box to make sure the outlet fix ok. I popped out one port in the box and placed in the nightstand where I wanted it and traced out the location of the port. I then drilled out a hole in the back panel to feed in a cord to be wired up to the outlet. I then screwed the box into position.
To wire up the outlet I took an extension cord the had a beak in the line that exposed some wire and cut the six feet off of the male end of the cord which had no breaks in it. First strip off enough insulation to wrap the bare wire around the screws on the outlet. The black wire will go to the brass/gold screw the white wire will go to the silver screw and the green/ground will go to the green screw. For my outlet I simply pushed the wire under the screw and tightened it done and gave the wire a tug to make sure it wasn't going to slip out. After everything is wired up screw the outlet into the box pulling the excess wire out the back.
For the lamp stand I used 1/2" black pipe and fittings. There are two floor flanges, two 90 degree elbows, one tee, one end cap, one coupler, one 12" pipe, one 3' pipe, one 4" pipe, one 1-1/2" nipple and two 1" nipples.
Some parts where covered in a coat of oil to protect it from rusting. This is unsightly to me so I took some steel wool and dish soap to scrub all of it off.
I assembled them as pictured. The two sections will be joined together and screwed to the side of the nightstand opposite the bed.
With the lamp stand attached I put four coats of spray lacquer to bring out he color of the wood and protect the black pipe from rusting.
Step 4: A Different Take on the Rope Light
When you hear rope light you think of colorful christmas lights that run the length of the rope. My take is a little different.
I wanted to have a lamp cord run through the center of a larger diameter sisal rope. I made a few attempts to do this and I will explain them and show you the way that I settle on.
My first thought was to take the length of sisal rope and the cord and carefully twist open a section of the three main strands of rope and push in the cord and continue that down the length of rope. This worked but exposed to much of the cord in the center. This is a good opposition if you do not have a rope machine and to get around the exposed cord you could buy or paint a cord that matches the color of the rope.
Next I tried unraveling the three strands completely and rewind them with the cord in the center but I could never get the strands to wind back up tight enough. it looked very sloppy.
I finally decided I needed to make my own rope. I made a machine that would do all the twisting using small strands of sisal twine. I plan on making a different machine that I will post an Instructable but he one in the pictures I made quickly because I was anxious to get done and post this Instructable.
The basics of the machine is to string several strands of twine between three hooks on one side and one anchor point on the other side. The three hooks on geared to a hand crank the will twist the strands together tightly. With a guide to keep the three main bundle of strands separated it moves from the single anchor point down the length of the rope. Adding the twists into the three bundles of strands in one directions causes the now three larger strands to twist the opposite direction as you move that guide down the rope. Before twisting I added lamp socket and cord into the middle.
Again I will be doing an instructable on how to build this machine and make rope. Hopefully soon so look for that.
The funnest part of making the rope was burning off all the small strands that stuck out from the rope.
Step 5: Finished and Final Thoughts
To finish I hung the pulley onto the pipe black pipe between the coupler and end cap which helped hold it into place and not slide around. Then thread the rope plug end through the pulley and down to the side of the nightstand. I took advantage of a natural knot hole to feed the rope through to get to the outlet. You might have to drill a hole if you don't have knot hole anywhere.
I am very please with the outcome of this project. The biggest problem I ran into was getting the cord into the rope. I plan on making a longer one in the future as a part of the rope making machine instructable that I talked about. The extra length of the rope will allow to wrap it around the bottom of the lamp stand section.
One other thing I would like to change in make the drawer a little smaller so it slide in and out a little easier. Keep that in mind you plan on making this.
I would love to hear any comments you have on this project.
Thank you for your interest and if you feel its worthy I would appreciate your vote in the wood and lamp contest.

Posted by Christopher M. Shoffner.
‚ÄúIf we are going to fix our ineffective and unsustainable healthcare ‚Äúsystem‚Äù the only real cure is a vibrant, diverse and independent Primary Care provider base. The only way to get that is to change the way people pay for primary care (giving everyone equal means). Everyone needs primary care and preventive services, not necessarily insurance. I even found SCOTUS making the statement that the only way to buy healthcare was to buy insurance; a false and somewhat scary assumption. By giving everyone the same means to purchase primary care and introducing pricing transparency into primary care, costs will go down and quality will improve. Why? because the patient is now the payer (the only single payer system I agree with) and they can hold the Practitioner/Practice accountable for wait times and interpersonal skills (are they listening to me?) This also alters the economics for the Practitioner; for the better. Reducing the administrative burden thrust upon each practice by the antiquated CPT Code based billing system. We are working diligently in NC (other states are waiting for the template) with all major parties to create the next major ‚Äúpilot project‚Äù for meaningful reform (Medicaid, State Health Plan, Private Payers). This is not a political effort, but an effort by one state to do what is in the best interest of its residents. This is why/how decisions should be made in the political realm.
Author‚Äôs Comments: (Health Train Express)
The terms left and right are counterproductive to the process and usually create a solution that is unpalatable to each side. One alternative would be to expand our little known service, NHS, National Health Service (the former public health service) See my blog at .This would in the short run offset the PCP shortage. ACOs will be a disaster except in already formed organization that are large and comprehensive. They can form an independent ACO
Peter,as a retired specialist (Ophthalmologist) and ex-PCP (ER and general practice for five years) I am on a mission to support Primary Care (the name of which I disagree intensely). I believe all specialists should strive to eliminate the RUC since it is not truly representative of PCP and places all principals in an adversarial position. PCPs have a far greater challenge in dealing with the bureaucracy that specialists avoid. In fact that is a primary reason why young physicians chose to specialize. I agree with all of your ideas and will continue to promote them in my writing, travels and speeches

April 1, 2020
Contact: Cassidy Walter
515-322-0435
JOHNSTON, IOWA ‚Äì Two Iowa Renewable Fuels Association (IRFA) members kicked off the new month by sending the second and third donated shipments of ethanol to the state of Iowa to be used by Iowa Prison Industries (IPI) to continue their production of much-needed hand sanitizer.
This week‚Äôs donations were made by Iowa ethanol producers Southwest Iowa Renewable Energy (SIRE) and Lakeview Plymouth Energy. It follows donations of ethanol and glycerin made earlier by IRFA members Absolute Energy and Western Iowa Energy. The hand sanitizer produced is being distributed for free by the state for priority use.
‚ÄúEven in the face of horrible plant economics, it‚Äôs gratifying to see how Iowa biofuel producers continue to step up to help our state in the midst of this pandemic,‚Äù said IRFA Executive Director Monte Shaw. ‚ÄúIn a time when fuel demand is down and biofuel producers are hurting, we applaud Southwest Iowa Renewable Energy, Lakeview Plymouth Energy, and other biofuel companies who are still working hard to contribute to the fight against COVID-19 by aiding in the critical production of hand sanitizer.‚Äù
Governor Kim Reynolds launched the program to utilize Iowa‚Äôs abundant ethanol and glycerin, a coproduct of biodiesel, production to help ease the shortage of hand sanitizer. Iowa Prison Industries worked to overcome regulatory hurdles and supply issues for other components in the FDA‚Äôs approved hand sanitizer formula.
‚ÄúGiven Iowa‚Äôs production of ethanol and glycerin, this sounded simple, but I can assure you it has taken a lot of hard work and ingenuity,‚Äù added Shaw. ‚ÄúAfter Gov. Reynolds provided the leadership to jumpstart this program, IPI has done incredible work securing the needed components, dealing with shipping, production and safety issues. It‚Äôs been a pleasure to work with them because IPI simply refused to take ‚Äòno‚Äô for an answer and have successfully put out thousands of gallons of hand sanitizer with more being produced every day.‚Äù

That way, when the mushrooms are cooked, they will have the best flavor and texture.
To make your own dried shihitake mushroom sauce, start by preparing a mix of dried shishito peppers, red chili peppers, and lime juice.
The peppers, chili peppers and lime will all be the same color.
Add about a cup of water to the mix and mix until the mix is very smooth.
It should be about 1 cup.
Add in a few teaspoons of salt and pepper, and a bit of vinegar to taste.
Add the mushrooms to the sauce, and mix again.
You‚Äôre done!
To prepare your taco, add some taco seasoning, shredded chicken, shredded cabbage, red onion, garlic, and green onions to the taco.
Toss the taco seasoning and shredded chicken together in a large bowl.
Add some diced mushrooms and chopped onion to the salad and toss it up to the top of the bowl.
Top with some chopped tomatoes and serve it with fresh salsa.
Serve with sour cream, guacamole, and cheese.Gray Enamel with Red Bowtie Tuxedo Cat Dangling Pierced Earring - REE943

.
The Netanyahu picture was taken one day after his election victory by Dan Bar Dov for Demotix/Corbis. Munayyer‚Äôs picture is from Mondoweiss.
Thanks, Jim. The ‚ÄúDog whistle‚Äô was heard around the world, by other dogs, hyenas, cats, lions, deer, wolves, tigers, elephants, guerillas, serpents, alligators, sharks, and whales, .
As you alluded, it still needs to be heard by our mainstream US public, when they rebel and demand to hear more facts, not lies.
It seems to me that this is the opportune time to upgrade BDS to be applied not only to products from Israeli settlements, but also to products from Israel itself. It is high time to do so, since Israel can easily manipulate products from Israel 1948, or its settlements in East Jerusalem, West Bank, and Gaza..
After all, Netanyahu said that there will be No Palestinian State under his watch. It is time to tell Netanyahu that, since he eliminated the demarcation line between Israel ‚Äô48 and ‚Äô67, then BDS will now certainly apply to all of the occupied territory between the River and the Sea.
Netanyahu‚Äôs racism against Non Jews came came out of the closet during this election, as well as his deceiving the world about having wanted a two state solution. The negotiations have always been a sham, because all Israel did was keep expanding and building new settlements even while ‚Äúnegotiating‚Äù
Netanyahu is a a Jewish supremist and liar. It‚Äôs time Israel went on sanctions for its illegal settlements and apartheid. It should also be on sanctions for building its nuclear bombs in secret as well, and threatening Iran with attack for decades
Excellent: Raising the ‚Äúprice of occupation‚Äù must be the witness of activists, using non-violent solutions.
P.S. Friedman is a hoot ‚Äî last week Likud was only ‚Äúcenter-right‚Äù? Einstein and Arendt in 1948 were correct, labeling their future leader a facist (in the NYT no less!).
I would agree with Munayyer: The central point is that the pseudo-peace talks are at an end and change by Israel will NOT come from within. The ‚Äúswing‚Äù vote will come from the US population. HOW it will come is still unknown. But it will come!
Thanks (again) Jim for gathering cogent comments from many sources to summarize the (what I would call) RADICAL shift in the tone of US mainstream conversation vis a vis our ‚Äúfriends‚Äù the Israelis. (I suppose you could say the popular media is finally listening to critics who have been there for a long time).
For the first time in a long time, it seems more permissible to actually call Israeli governmental actions into question, ie, to actually be critical of Israeli policies. Out in print. In the open. Finally.
For a long time, the MSM (mainstream media), especially in the US, has not been permitted to air public criticism. That taboo has been irretrievably smashed. Even American Jews can no longer project a monolithic unity of unquestioning support for the State of Israel.
What is more. The cat is out of the bag. The US public is finally seeing that the Emperor has NO CLOTHES! He‚Äôs been posturing all this time, hoodwinking US and the world, about how he has wanted to share the land with those pesky Palestinians, but they refuse to accept Israeli terms (which have long been demeaning, patronizing, and completely unrealistic).
Instead of Palestinians wanting ALL the land, it has been the Israelis, all along, who have wanted ALL the land, and have been building settlements like mad to give the lie to their charge. ‚ÄúIt is never I and my people who are in any way guilty for the historic impasse; it is always them, the hateful enemy that wants to destroy us‚Äù, etc., etc. ad nauseum.
In worked in South Africa. It can work here. It‚Äôs called BDS. Just now, Josh Reubner of End the Occupation is calling on President Obama to start acting on this convictions and consider what previous US Presidents have repeatedly done: Withhold (as in sanctions), American aid because of Israeli actions that go contrary to US policies in the region. Yes to that. It‚Äôs high time. I think Obama now has reached what you have called ‚Äúa tipping point‚Äù. We have a long way to go, but it‚Äôs more stark. It‚Äôs more clear. The options are clearer. A Jewish ethnocracy that demeans the minority; or a pluralistic, truly democratic state, with liberty and justice for all.
American $ must now be extended or withheld that are in line with US principles, not Likud or Jewish/Zionist Nationalism.
(The irony is that Obama‚Äôs criticism of PM Bibi is based on Bibi‚Äôs repudiation of the Two-State ‚Äúsolution‚Äù to the ‚Äúconflict‚Äù. The Two-State solution has long been dead. The only true option is for the One State to be truly pluralistic (for the present 20% Arab citizens) and proper adjudication of Arab refugee claims ‚Äì to say nothing of compensation for land theft, home demolitions and olive orchard destruction, check-point indignities, etc., etc.)
The grassroots are growing up, sprouting and spreading nationwide. For KUSA ‚Äì Holland/Zeeland Community, I am . . . . .
Very good, Jim. The gulf between the American Left and the Israeli Left (and you have to include many of the Palestinian Israelis who are in the Combined List) is very wide. I just finished checking in at +972 and taking a look at the moving responses of Noam Sheizaf at the recent J-Street convocation to get a sense of where the gap lies. The United States, for all of its talk, has never approached this issue from a human rights perspective, Sheizaf says, and needs to start taking human rights seriously. And Human Rights provides the justification for the BDS Movement, which is based on Human Rights principles. With the Leahy law regarding the illegality of the export of arms to countries that commit human rights crimes, we have the perfect leverage into the ‚ÄúS‚Äù in BDS. And as Sheizaf says in the panel discussion, when Israel ran out of shells during the last Gaza massacre, the US opened up its bunkers and replenished their arsenal. If that is not a clear indication of how we should push for Sanctions, I don‚Äôt know what is. Josh Ruebner made this call back in 2011 on the End the Occupation website. It‚Äôs a call we need to heed.
In addition to BDS (which as grass-roots involvement is essential, though a hard sell), I believe we need to plan strategically right now for the next United Nations vote opposing Israel. Clearly the world is increasingly impatient with the way Netanyahu and other Israeli leaders flaunt international law. There will come, sooner than later, a vote in the Security Council, and the U.S. will be expected to hold up a shield to ‚Äúprotect Israel‚Äù by exercising its veto. Here is an opportunity for President Obama to assert his executive authority. The U.S. could at least abstain.
I believe that the grass roots must speak through BDS. But we must also send a signal that at least this administration is ready to listen to the world‚Äôs impatience with Israel.
Martin Bailey is right. We must send a signal that this administration is ready to listen to the world‚Äôs impatience with Israel. If the Palestinian-Israeli conflict is not resolved before Obama leaves office, it may never be resolved.

With an extensive 38 years within the healthcare industry, seasoned Nurse Practitioner Ward will be bringing her comprehensive expertise in Cardiology, Heart Failure, Adult Heart Transplant, and Nursing Research to the wealth of ability among AHC Nursing Board affiliates. The American Health Council applauds Ward for the work she is doing in the field of transplantation and dedication as a nurse educator.
Ward has always loved helping others. Looking for a way to translate that passion into a fulfilling profession, Ward turned to nursing.

Ward graduated with highest honors in her undergraduate nursing studies and with high honors in her graduate studies as she earned an MSN from Creighton University in 2003. She has made an impact on the treatment and care of the heart failure population with her drive to improve the quality of patient care. During her time at Creighton University, Ward followed the Jesuit mission of Creighton to treat the poor and underserved. In addition to her hard work and dedication, Ward attributes her professional success to the insight and value she gained from the Jesuit mission.
In her present capacity as Advanced Registered Nurse Practitioner at Memorial Regional Hospital, Ward manages advanced heart failure patients. Her duties are dynamic and far-reaching. She is the Lead Advanced Heart Failure Coordinator responsible for inpatient and outpatient management of the advanced heart failure, mechanical support, and adult heart transplant patients. As an active contributor to healthcare research, she is involved in multiple clinical research trials and supports investigator-initiated research. Furthermore, Ward is involved in multiple education projects for both the hospital and clinic staff. She sits on the Heart Failure Task Force for the Memorial Healthcare System to improve clinical outcomes and patient quality indicators.
Her laudable accomplishments have been recognized by professional awards spanning Ward‚Äôs almost four decades in healthcare. Her academic proficiency in graduate school precipitated in the Constance Smith Peterson Award for her nursing accomplishments and community service. Her talent as a devoted clinician was also acknowledged by her peers. Ward received the Employee of the Quarter honor, and the "Customer Excellence" Award and Patient First Awards from Creighton University Medical Center. She has lectured at a variety of speaking engagements on local, state and national levels, providing much-needed health-related guidance to the American public. This professional success inspired Ward to consider a teaching position where she can share her valuable expertise. Ward is presently an Adjunct Nursing Faculty Member at Creighton University and Broward College. In addition, she maintains professional associations with the Heart Failure Society of America and the American Association of Heart Failure Nursing.
Ward is proud of her educational accomplishments and work she has done so far. In her professional future, Ward hopes to be an integral part of the expansion of growth in the heart failure services at Memorial Regional Hospital. She can see herself transitioning into a more active teaching role at the university-level to further grow as a nurse and nurse educator. In her leisure time, Ward enjoys reading autobiographies and spending time with her grandchildren. A testament to her altruistic character, Ward donates her time and resources generously to the American Heart Association and Mended Hearts, a nonprofit organization dedicated to serving heart disease patients, their families, and their caregivers. The American Health Council‚Äôs Nursing Board welcomes Ward‚Äôs specialized knowledge in heart failure and transplantation care and commitment to high-quality patientHeNan, China[email protected]

The Omni-Path hardware and drivers should operate correctly when co-resident with InfiniBand HCAs and their associated drivers. However, on Jessie (Debian 8.x), kmod-ifs-kernel-updates installs a version of ib_mad that includes jumbo MAD support. This version of ib_mad is required for OPA, and is incompatible with the InfiniBand drivers that are in-box with Jessie.
This document is only relevant to Jessie. Debian Stretch's 4.9 kernel ib_mad module already includes support for jumbo MAD, and IB drivers should not require recompilation to be co-resident with OPA on that version of the operating system.
Current Behavior¬∂
The behavior that will be experienced when loading an in-box InfiniBand driver co-resident with OPA is a report of "invalid parameters". Syslog will contain reports of "disagrees about version of symbol ib_unregister_mad_agent", etc. This is due to the fact that the updated ib_mad module has a different version of its ABI than what is expected by the in-box drivers.
It is important to note that the InfiniBand SM must not be running on a machine that has OPA installed. The SM must be executed on an IB-only node. Furthermore, the OPA and IB fabrics are orthogonal to each other. There is no direct communication between the two types of fabric.
Building IB Drivers Against OPA-enabled Headers¬∂
In order to use the in-box InfiniBand drivers with the jumbo-MAD-enabled ib_mad module, they must be recompiled against the updated headers. This process is outlined below. The build system must have build-essentials installed. The build should be executed as a non-root user.
This process assumes that the mlx4 driver is to be included with kmod-ifs-kernel-updates. It should apply to other InfiniBand drivers.
# mkdir ifsbuild # cd ifsbuild # dget # cp ../IntelOPA-IFS.DEBIAN8-x86_64.10.4.2.0.7-2/packages/ifs-kernel-updates*{orig,debian}* . # tar xf ifs-kernel-updates_3.16.0-616.orig.tar.gz # cd ifs-kernel-updates-3.10.0_327.el7.x86_64 # tar xf ../ifs-kernel-updates_3.16.0-616-1ifs.debian.tar.xz # QUILT_PATCHES=‚Äúdebian/patches" quilt push -a # cp -r ../linux-3.16.43/drivers/infiniband/hw/mlx4/ . # cd mlx4 # mv Makefile Makefile.org # cd ..
mlx4/Makefile must now be created. The source below will work for the current version of the mlx4 driver (Jessie 8.9).
Makefile.org should be examined to determine the correct directives for
obj-$(CONFIG_MLX4_INFINIBAND) and
mlx4_ib-y.
# # mlx4 module # # # Called from the kernel module build system. # ifneq ($(KERNELRELEASE),) #kbuild part of makefile ccflags-y := -I$(src)/../include obj-$(CONFIG_MLX4_INFINIBAND) += mlx4_ib.o mlx4_ib-y := ah.o cq.o doorbell.o mad.o main.o mr.o qp.o srq.o mcg.o cm.o alias_GUID.o sysfs.o else #normal makefile KDIR ?= /lib/modules/`uname -r`/build default: $(MAKE) -C $(KDIR) M=$$PWD NOSTDINC_FLAGS=-I$$PWD clean: $(MAKE) -C $(KDIR) M=$$PWD clean install: $(MAKE) INSTALL_MOD_DIR=updates -C $(KDIR) M=$$PWD modules_install endif
Now, the top-level Makefile should be edited to include mlx4 in the build. Add mlx4/ to the end of the obj-y directive. The trailing slash is necessary.
obj-y := rdmavt/ ib_uverbs/ hfi1/ ib_mad/ opa_compat/ \ ib_umad/ ib_sa/ ib_cm/ ib_ucm/ rdma_cm/ rdma_ucm/ ib_srpt/ ib_ipoib/ mlx4/
It may be desirable to update the package version in
debian/changelog to indicate that the package is different than what was shipped with IFS. An entry may be made at the beginning of the file:
ifs-kernel-updates (3.16.0-616-1ifs-mlx4) UNRELEASED; urgency=medium * Add mlx4 module -- Your Name <youremail> Tue, 11 Jul 2017 11:38:22 -0500
The package may now be built via the command:
# debuild -us -uc -b
The
-b flag is necessary because the source does not include a patch to account for the mlx4 additions. If a source package is desired: exclude the
-b flag, create a patch with quilt and add Makefile and mlx4/* to the patch. Further explanation of this process is beyond the scope of this document. See for more information.
The build should complete without errors, although lintian may complain about a few things. The package may now be installed with:
# sudo dpkg -i ../kmod-ifs-kernel-updates_3.16.0-616-1ifs_amd64.deb # depmod -a
The system should now have a recompiled driver installed to
/lib/modules/3.16.0-4-amd64/updates/ifs-kernel-updates/mlx4/mlx4_ib.ko and
modprobe mlx4_ib should execute without errors.
ibstat should include information for the mlx4_0 device.
The system will also need the libmlx4 package installed in order to provide user-space ibverbs access. User-space packages should not require recompilation.

A lot of conventional nail polish still contains some pretty dodgy stuff. Formaldehyde, anyone? Us neither.
When non-toxic nail polish arrived to support our health, planet and our manis, the X-free branding of nail polish was developed to show people the number of chemicals a polish is free from. But over time, this has turned into something of a marketing arms race. With no cosmetic governing body, the X-free labelling got out of hand very quickly, with some companies even including animal products in their ‚Äòfree from‚Äô list.
We decided to step back from the brouhaha and let our formula do all the talking. We are confident our polish is the cleanest AND will give you a durable manicure. But don‚Äôt just take our word for it. We are certified by Made Safe who have analysed every single ingredient and deemed us the cleanest.
Sienna nail polish has always been free of Formaldehyde, DBP, Toluene, Tosylamide/Formaldehyde Resin, Synthetic Camphor, Xylene and Benzophenone -1.
In the name of our commitment to full transparency, we list all the ingredients in our products on our FAQ‚Äôs.
It is worth mentioning that Sienna polish has never contained Benzophenone-1, a known endocrine disrupter. Some of the polishes labelled X-free still include it in their formulas, so when in doubt, check the ingredients list.About Matt

Spinal cord disease can be associated with temporary or permanent inability to empty the urinary bladder. The result is a very full, over-stretched and uncomfortable bladder that is at risk for bacterial infection. Bladder management should improve comfort and reduce the chances of damage or infection of the bladder and kidney.
Bladder management involves frequent trips to places where your dog or cat typically urinates ‚Äì the smell and a safe environment may allow them to relax and eliminate. Medication can also be used that will allow the urinary sphincter to relax (valium, phenoxybenzamine) or the bladder to contract (bethanechol). Lastly, a technique called manual bladder expression can be used to squeeze urine from your pet‚Äôs bladder. This technique is described below:
Bladder location:
If you bend over such that your torso is perpendicular to your hips or parallel to the ground and think about where your bladder is positioned, this will be the same for a dog or cat. The bladder will be tucked up in the top and back of the abdomen right in front of the pelvis or if completely full it may be farther forward along the body wall.
Steps to bladder expression:
- With your pet lying on its side, place hands in a prayer-like fashion over the area where you imagine the bladder is located. If your pet is strong enough to support its weight then this procedure can be done while standing. You may find this procedure works better for you if your hands are facing toward the front of the animal as opposed to the rear.
- Slowly apply equal and progressively increasing pressure to body wall and by extension the urinary bladder. Slow steady and progressive pressure is the key. This is a skill that your pet likely requires so try to be patient, keep trying and DO NOT BECOME DISCOURAGED.
The spinal cord can heal and hopefully your pet will regain the ability to urinate. If, while urinating without assistance, your pet is developing a stream of urine then it is likely this procedure is no longer necessary. If they are dribbling urine or not developing a good stream of urine in a 12 hour period, then likely they still need manual bladder expression. If your pet is painful during this process or the urine is a dark color, blood colored or smells foul then please seek veterinary care.

Jets: Part II.
By Tom Mahoney
3. Interesting Contrast- The best part of this game will be contrasting the two rookies: Zach Wilson was the wacky unpredictable QB at BYU, with the magic arm. Mac was the underrated QB at Alabama, who only got playing time when the Starters got injured, and overcame the rest with smarts, fortitude, and winning. Finally going undefeated and becoming a Champion his senior season. Now, Wilson is struggling with the mental transition to the NFL. While Mac just keeps getting better and better, and looks more like a winner each week.
‚ÄúThey certainly had an impressive win against the Titans a couple weeks back. (Zach) Wilson hit a lot of big throws. They continue to run the ball well. It's a really good running team,‚Äù BB said. ‚ÄúHe had a lot of big throws against Tennessee. He hit some of the outside throws like he did against us. Downfield throws against Tennessee. He's athletic. Gets out of the pocket every week. It's a challenge back there to contain.‚Äù
Both QBs are improving. Being a starting QB in the NFL might be the toughest thing to do in sports. Both guys are really in over their heads. Zach has the advantage physically; He has the better arm and is a better athlete. Meanwhile, Mac is ahead of him mentally, which is so much more important in the NFL. The mental burden put on QBs in the NFL has ruined a lot of young QBs. Mac has handled it so much better than Zack, but Wilson has clearly been making progress the past few weeks, making some good throws. Plus, Mac has twice as many wins as Zach (2 to 1;)
‚ÄúIt's a lot of little things. They haven't changed their offense or changed their defense. They're better at it,‚Äù BB Said. ‚ÄúThey've got more experience doing it, and they're better at it. We're better together as a group in all three phases, playing good complementary football and having a better understanding of the scheme, what they're asked to do, and how they do it.‚Äù
Mac is really a cerebral QB, like Brady was: smart reads, efficient, keep getting 1st Downs. While Zack is the more instinctual QB, like Brett Favre. He runs around like a chicken with his head cut off, spots a WR deep downfield, and just slings it, like so very few could do. So it only makes sense that he would struggle more than Mac, mentally, as a rookie. The Jets are 1 and 4. There only winning coming against the said Titans, where he completed some wacky deep throws.
‚ÄúI think Zach's a really good player," Mac said about Z.‚Äù
4. Pats Defense- The Pats Defense has been up and down. But when you‚Äôre a rookie QB, you really win with defense. The Pats Defense got a little beat-up last week against Dallas and their Veteran QB. They beat up on the Dallas Offense early and forced them into a lot of errors. But the veteran QB stepped it up at the end of the game, and showed how veteran QBs win games. It was a great learning experience for Mac to see. I don‚Äôt see Zach doing that this week.
‚ÄúOur offense is 3rd Down Conversions, possessing the ball and moving the chains, and those give opportunities to run the ball more. The one game where we were able to do that was the New England game and we were able to get possessions," Jets HC Robert Saleh said. "We were able to move the football and we were able to run the ball pretty effectively against New England, but obviously we were turning the ball over at inopportune times. It comes with opportunity and I think once the structure's there, they're getting better at it, but it definitely is not showing. I'm not going to argue with you on that one, but we feel really good about our O-line and where it's at, and it's only going to get better.‚Äù
What happened last week, is not going to happen this week. Zach Wilson really has struggled on every level, except against the Titans for some reason. He is not ready for primetime, and the Patriots Defense is going to put a hurt on him. He has the magic arm and the homefield, but he hasn‚Äôt shown hardly any of the mental acumen that Mac has shown. He's just winging it and flinging it, like he got away with at BYU. Which is a long way from the NFL. He has to show a lot more mentally, then he showed at BYU, to be successful in the NFL.
‚ÄúI think we all stand in lockstep with Joe [Douglas], in terms of we're going to be identified upfront. Our O-line has played very well here over the last few weeks and we anticipate them to continue to play well. Our D-line has been extremely effective. Very-very good playing with a lot of energy. A lot of just overpowering teams, overpowering their opponent," Jets HC Robert Saleh said. "I think it's starting to get established. I know it's hard to see right now, but I think in the trenches, we've been the better team with the exception of those first couple of weeks. But it's been coming along and I think our guys are starting to understand where we're going to make hay and where we're going to win football games.".‚Äù
5. Jets Defense- The Pats and the Jets are in amazingly similar situations. With rookies running their Offenses, they are both over reliant on the Defense. But even when the defense plays well, they have only been able to win one game, when their rookie QB played well in the 2nd half against the Titans. The Jets Offense scored 17-points in the 2nd Half and Overtime. Both Offenses have struggled with rookie QBs. The QB who plays the best will win the game.
‚ÄúDefensively, they continue to play aggressively. One of the best red area teams in the league. They've done a good job of playing on a short field, which they've had to do a few times this year, but they've played really well there,‚Äù BB said. ‚ÄúAll those guys are high-motor guys. (John Franklin) Myers has good power. Good speed on the edge. They do a good job pushing the pocket with their inside guys, so that makes it sometimes difficult for the quarterback to step up, which brings the outside guys into the rush. Quarterback can't move up in the pocket, and then that brings them closer to him. I'd say, again, good complementary rush their run game is up there. Those big guys inside do a good job penetrating, and that clears some space for the edge guys.‚Äù
The two teams are similar. They both have good veteran teams with terrific veteran Defense‚Ä¶ and rookie QBs. Both defenses can put a hurt on an Offense. Both Veteran Defenses know they have to win the game, because their Offenses are not running on all cylinders, with rookies running the engine. And then pray that Wilson can hit a couple of wacky deep throws that 90 precent of QBs can‚Äôt make. Hope, he can put up some points with his wacky instincts while running around like a chicken with his head cut off.
‚ÄúIn our scheme, with the chaos we create up front, our guys are more run and hit, more lateral players," Saleh said. "We look at them, these young men, they're down safeties, which is basically linebackers. There's examples all over the league where guys didn't play behind the ball or it's just very hard to evaluate linebackers nowadays with how the college game has evolved.
The Jets have tried to overcome the rookie QB more with the running game. They want to turn this game into a physical attack on both side of the ball. Attack the Pats Defense with their physical run game, and hope the rookie QB doesn‚Äôt blow it up. They run-run-rub to get the Defense leaning forward. Then try to throw over the top with Wilson‚Äôs great arm. It‚Äôs a good strategy that should be more successful when they don‚Äôt have a rookie QB trying to execute it.
"What can we see from those guys? We can see their ability to read, diagnose the run, hit play coverage and understand the rough concepts infront of them. We feel like they would be able to translate to linebacker easily."
While the Patriots have more of a disciplined do your job defense. It is all about being in the right place at the right time. Keeping the Offense infront of you, let them make the mistake infront of you so the defenders can pounce. It‚Äôs a smart, disciplined veteran defense that will make the Rookie think a lot more than he has in other games. More than his coaches want him too. And thinking is not really his forte. Reading a disciplined Defense isn‚Äôt really his forte either.
6. Jets Offense- The Pats Defense has been up and down. When you have a rookie QB, you really win with defense. The D got a little beat-up last week against Dallas and their Veteran QB. The Jets Offense is not in the same stratosphere as the Cowboys Offense. Dak Prescott is a smart veteran QB, who won it in the clutch, like all good veterans QBs must do. I don‚Äôt see Zach Wilson doing that yet.
‚ÄúThey've got (Corey) Davis. They've got (Elijah) Moore. They've got (Keelan) Cole,‚Äù BB said. ‚ÄúGood backs. They've got (Tyler) Kroft. He (Zach Wilson) has got a bunch of guys. It's always good to have them open."
The Pats played more of a contain defense last week. Keeping the QB in the pocket. What they did last week is the perfect came play for Wilson. He‚Äôs at his best when he can flee the pocket, get outside, and whip the ball 40-50 yards downfield. He‚Äôs not as good a thrower in the pocket. He does not run a controlled balanced offense. He wants to escape the pocket. So he can read the coverage better, and make a wacky throw with his wacky arm. The Pats D will do everything they can to keep him contained in the pocket.
‚ÄúWhen offenses can generate an explosive play in a drive, their percentages of scoring are astronomical,‚Äù Jets HC Saleh said. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs almost guaranteed that they‚Äôre going to get three points. Two explosives in a drive, you might as well just put seven on the board and kick the ball off. So, the objective is to make them go earn it.‚Äù
It sounds like the Pats and Jets have the same strategy, but have opposite tactics to affect the QB. Play tough smart Defense, and try to take advantage of the Rookie QBs mistakes. The Pats want to keep Zach Wilson in the Pocket and force him to read and throw from a stationary position. While Saleh wants to pressure and move Mac Jones out of the pocket and throw on the run.
‚ÄúHe‚Äôs way better than I wanted him to be,‚Äù Jets DC Jeff Ulbrich said about Mac. .‚Äù
Mac is a pocket passer, and Wilson is best escaping the pocket. So he can see his receivers better and is much better throwing on the move. Whichever Defense is best using their opposite tactics will win this game. If Mac can stay in the pocket and throw in rhythm, Pats win. If Wilson can escape the pocket and make big throws downfield, it will be tough for the Pats to match those points.
7. Jets Defense- The Pats win. Mac is just more advanced. Both teams have the Vets on both sides of the ball, and the Jets have home field, which will hurt rookie QBs a lot more. But Mac has progressed so much more mentally, and in making plays that lead to wins that he pulls the game out in the end.

Ask Rookie :)
Dear Rookie, Are you the Director?‚ÄìC. Crate
Hello C. Crate, Why yes, actually I am! I mean, I don‚Äôt want to brag or anything. There‚Äôs no way I could be in charge of so many AWESOME penguins all by myself. It‚Äôs definitely a team effort. But yes, I have been a director many times. Just recently I helped direct a production of Twelfth Fish. Oh! And I also directed a tour of the Boiler Room once. Good times. Oh wait... Wait, did you mean am I THE DIRECTOR? Like, the Director of the Elite Penguin Force? Oh nooo! No no no no no no! N! O! That‚Äôs a big no! The Director is the bravest, smartest, awesomest, bossiest agent ever! NO one knows who they are. Well, maybe G does. Remind me to ask him. No wait! Don‚Äôt! This information is classified! Nothing to see here folks!
Nothing helps you keep your cool like a pair of sunglasses on your face.
Dear Rookie, Why do you wear your sunglasses all the time?‚ÄìSoon Classes
Dear Soon Classes, Ahh, my sunglasses. We‚Äôve been through thick and thin. They‚Äôre like a pair of trusty friends you can wear on your face. A better question would be why WOULDN‚ÄôT I wear them all the time. For one thing, wearing sunglasses is like getting a super power. They let me look at the sun WITHOUT SQUINTING. So awesome. But I guess the biggest reason I wear them all the time is that they help me keep my cool. Whenever I make a mistake, they help me look on the bright side. By making everything less bright. And I make a LOT of mistakes. Oh, and sometimes I accidentally glue them to my face. Which is just silly, because I‚Äôm usually just trying to glue my hat on. Thanks for your question!

Like Macgyver but onlineThoughts on the last shuttle flight
In 1961, John F Kennedy placed a tremendous goal before the United States. Make it to the moon before 1970. Some will say that we put too much money and effort into this, but no one can deny the boost given to the economy nor the technological innovations that took place during the space program.
The miniaturization of electronics needed to meet the size and weight of spacecraft fueled our consumer electronics for the next 40 years. If you watch some of the original news footage, an astronaut is showing Walter Cronkite the camera being used on the lunar surface. It‚Äôs a hand-held camera smaller and lighter than any used by reporters. Blazoned on the side is an RCA logo. Not more than 6 years later, RCA introduces the first video camera for consumer use.
In 1968, before we had even reached the moon, a second order of Saturn V rockets was cancelled by President Johnson. With that decision, the hopes of having additional lunar missions or a permanent US presence in space was delayed for nearly 30 years. In 1975, we launched the last Apollo mission, the Apollo-Soyuz mission. At the time, the Space Shuttle was under development and glide testing got underway just 2 years later. Delays in the program left the US without manned spaceflight capability for almost 6 years and doomed the Skylab space station.
With the last launch of the Space Shuttle today we are entering another period where the US lacks its own manned spaceflight capability. We are relying on the Russians for transport to the International Space Station. In my opinion this is a dangerous situation. If they choose to, the Russians can raise the price per seat or even cut off access completely to the station.
The best hope for the US manned space program lies with the private sector. Even here however, NASA is placing roadblocks. SpaceX () has successfully demonstrated the capability to launch, maneuver, and successfully re-enter and recover a unmanned pressurized capsule. The next mission was scheduled to demonstrate maneuvering around the ISS. Due to the success of the last test flight, SpaceX has requested to skip that mission and move directly to a mission docking at the ISS; however NASA has rejected that request.
SpaceX is currently working on an emergency escape system for its Dragon capsule. Unlike previous manned spacecraft, this escape system is being designed as thrusters built onto the capsule. This provides escape separation capability all the way to orbit not just during the initial lift phase. In addition, SpaceX sees this being used during landing/re-entry to provide land based landing as opposed to sea recovery. It is anticipated that SpaceX will be ready for a manned mission by 2015, a mere 4 years away.
Private enterprise in America has always allowed for greater innovation. Once free of the bureaucracy and politics associated with government programs, I‚Äôm sure we will see faster development and more innovation. One only needs to look at the computer industry to see this.
One final thought ‚Äì $1 Billion of the 2009 Federal Stimulus was allocated to NASA, mostly to allow for 2 additional shuttle flights. If we had placed $50 billion with NASA, what kind of innovation or programs would have come out of that?
What are your thoughts on the impact of the last shuttle flight and the loss of US manned spaceflight capability?

Karachi Electric Supply Company (also known as K-Electric) has gained notoriety these past few days for not providing electricity in most areas of the day (including during Iftar and Sehri timings in some localities) in Karachi.
Sindh High Court (SHC) with a two member bench, chaired by Justice Irfan Saadat Khan, has ordered NEPRA to take any and all legal actions against the power utility company saying that K-Electric should follow NEPRA‚Äôs guidelines.
It should be noted that NEPRA made area-wide loadshedding illegal on January 22, 2016.
Petition on Unannounced Loadshedding
The hearings at SHC began on Monday after a petition was filed regarding unannounced loadshedding by K-Electric. The petition was filed by social activist Karamat Ali who was presented in the court.
Mr Karamat‚Äôs lawyer, Faisal Siddiqui argued that electricity supply for an entire area should not suffer due to non payment of bills from one person. He continued, saying that electricity theft should not be remedied by cutting power supply to everyone in a given area and instead the thief should pay the price.
During the hearing, officials of K-Electric were also present.
80% of Karachi in The Dark
The Supreme Court of Pakistan (SCP) had ordered K-Electric back in 2014 to avoid loadshedding during the holy month of Ramzan, according to Mr. Faisal. Despite the order, 80% of Karachi did not have electricity during Sehr on the first day of Ramzan this year.
The court reserved its decision for later on the same day.
Protests Across The City
Loadshedding in Karachi has sparked a series of protests across the city. So much so that even the likes of Spiderman were seen protesting right next to everyone.

He went on to wrap himself up in chains to mock K-Electric, saying that the power utility was holding people as hostages.
why only k electric‚Ä¶why not sepco and hesco
Very Good News, we wants NEPRA to take KE in govt custody or a corporation so that the decisions can be made in the benefits of common citizen, currently KE have no will, no expertise, to run KE in the interest of country and peoples of Karachi. They are only looting in excess/wrong billing and loadshedding at the highest level, same issue reoccur in 2 days, Tripping of Main stream at Jamshoro
thank god in lahore electricity is own by government not a private company‚Ä¶‚Ä¶.just three to four hours of load shedding in 24 hours
Where in Lahore? Please tell me. Mein wahein shift ho jata hn.
I DON‚ÄôT NOW ABOUT ELECTRICITY CONDITION OF MANY AREAS BUT I LIVE IN JOHARTOWN
Khokhar chowk is also in johar town. ATM at khokhar chowk. since 9 A.M 4 hours was loadshedding. Even now there is no light.
well i live in d block and there is 3 to 4 hours of load shedding in 24 hours
good luck with your situation
Are you adding UPS back time in it as well? Strange? or May be some Politically strong person lives in your area.
In most part of lahore there is 6 to 8 hour load shedding plus low voltage most of the time
idk about load shedding but i must agree with you on low voltage its so annoying .
OUR AC barley works for 30 min and then phussss‚Ä¶.
In my opinion two things are must. (1) KE should be broken into further small companies for easy management and competition (2) NEPRA should make policy and operative rules ensuring general consumer interests especially passing petrol price impact to consumers through higher rates and discriminating slab rates.
This is ridicules..they are taking heavy bills from us & from chand raat we are facing almost 15 hours load shedding every day, also shortage of water due to lack of electricity‚Ä¶. What the hell Govt. is doing for fasting people??
if you are gonna give votes to pp and mqm than this will must happen come on man change something please this time give votes to other parties if you want change in sindh espacially karachi im not supporting niether i am hating some party i just want to say just dont give votes to these to damn parties i either dont live in karachi but when i watch situation of karachi on tv oh!!!!damn what the hell they have done to this city and province.
Even if you don‚Äôt vote or vote some other ‚Äòparty‚Äô than these two, they ll still have higher number of votes. If you know what I mean ‚Ä¶ Same thing for N league. Jski bari h lagi h, wohi aigi party doesn‚Äôt matter if not one person votes for that said party.
You are right..but there is lack of sincere leadership‚Ä¶each & every political party is corrupt‚Ä¶we don‚Äôt have even a single person who is trust-able‚Ä¶The most earning city‚Ä¶.the most ignored one.
2018 Kay elections Mai Nawaz sharif, ya zardari, ya mqm ko dobara vote deejay ga, aur osi circle Mai ghoomtay raheay ga, jis Mai hum decades Sai ghoomtay raheay hain.

While news of the soon-to-begin travel bubble with Australia has been met with excitement by travel lovers and people with family over the ditch, the agriculture sector is hoping it will lead to more foreign workers being allowed into the country.
On Tuesday Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern announced the bubble - which means quarantine-free travel between New Zealand and Australia - will begin on April 19.
The Government says doing away with quarantine for those arriving from Australia will free up between 1000 and 1300 rooms per fortnight in managed isolation and quarantine (MIQ) facilities.
Although around 500 of those spaces will be kept as "contingency should they be needed for the trans-Tasman arrangement", the bubble means there are now hundreds of more places available in MIQ.
Now, with many primary industries continuing to face severe labour shortages, there are calls for those free spaces to go to foreign workers in the farming, horticulture and viticulture sectors.
"MIQ spacing has been continually quoted as a barrier for getting the workers we need," Federated Farmers immigration spokesperson Chris Lewis said on Wednesday.
"With more beds becoming available [the Government] should now allow those with agricultural skills to enter the country."
Lewis said Federated Farmers acknowledged the Government had already made some limited border exceptions for agricultural machinery operators, veterinarians, sheep shearers, animal pregnancy scanners and some skilled dairy staff. However, "these limited exceptions aren't going to go very far with the number of workers needed across the primary industries in the coming months," he said.
"With continued low unemployment and the majority of available workers remaining in the urban centres, all of the primary industries are crying out for labour."
Mike Chapman, chief executive of Horticulture New Zealand, told Newshub he was also hopeful some of the free MIQ spots would go to migrant agriculture workers.
Although the Government granted border exemptions for 2000 recognised seasonal employer (RSE) workers from Pacific countries, that only went a small way to covering the total shortfall of between 5000 and 10,000 workers the industry faced during the peak harvest period.
It's estimated the lack of workers will cost the sector hundreds of millions of dollars in losses, with the labour shortage forcing many growers to leave fruit to rot on trees.
Chapman said the agreement with Australia is a "good start" but even if some of the MIQ places do go to workers in the horticulture industry, it comes too late to help growers during the busy harvest period.
However, he said, "in terms of winter pruning it's not too late".
"If there was some movement through these spaces at MIQ it would be a great assistance to the winter pruning and also it would flow through into the spring crop," he said.
"So it would be an enormous assistance."
But while it is important to get workers into the country in time for winter, Chapman said the real focus was avoiding another labour shortage next harvest season.
"To avoid what happened this year we really need to go back to making the RSE scheme work as it always has - a two-way flow of workers up to the cap of 14,400."
He said the best way for that to happen was through vaccinations and "a new system that doesn't involve MIQ".
When asked about the issue on Wednesday, Agriculture Minister Damien O'Connor told reporters he "certainly will be advocating for more RSE workers to be brought in" if there is an opportunity to do so.
"We'll certainly be putting forward the case that should there be any MIQ space available from the trans-Tasman bubble that some of those places be available for horticulture and agriculture workers," he said.
However, that would have to be balanced by the fact there are still many New Zealanders wanting to come home as well as other sectors calling for essential workers to be given access to MIQ facilities, he said.
COVID-19 Response Minister Chris Hipkins said a decision on how to best utilise the extra MIQ rooms was likely later this month.
"The Government will consider the best ways to use the remaining rooms over the coming weeks, including the option of finding more places for people from the Pacific, including the RSE workforce," Hipkins said in a statement to Newshub.
"[Immigration] Minister [Kris] Faafoi continues to engage with the horticulture and wine sectors around workforce needs, and he reiterates that industries put together plans to better attract New Zealanders and onshore migrants into work."MOST.

The decision paves the way for personal data to be transferred freely from the EU to the UK and will be welcomed by multinational companies.
The decision will allow the European Commission to adopt two adequacy decisions before the end of June to allow a seamless transition at the end of a six-month grace period for data flows.
It relates to the EU‚Äôs overarching General Data Protection Regulation and a directive on processing data connected with criminal offences, including victims, witnesses and suspects.
Prior to Brexit the UK was automatically considered as being aligned to EU data protection standards, but the EU deemed that a fresh assessment was required after the Brexit transition period ended.
Transitional arrangements were agreed alongside the EU-UK Trade and Cooperation Agreement reached in late 2020 to allow personal data to continue to flow freely from EU member states to the UK in the short-term, but there had been uncertainty over the longer-term position.
However, in February, the European Commission issued draft ‚Äòadequacy decisions‚Äô with a view to facilitating the continued free flow of personal data from the EU to the UK..
Chris Combemale, CEO of the Data & Marketing Association (DMA), said: ‚ÄúA positive decision on data adequacy is a huge relief for thousands of businesses across the UK ‚Äì over half of businesses surveyed by the DMA just before Brexit stated this was important for the future of their business. The government estimated that without adequacy the UK economy could lose up to ¬£85 billion, so this announcement is a significant boost after a challenging year.
‚ÄúThe DMA has been working with the UK Government and our DMA partners from across the EU since the Brexit deal negotiations began to impress the fundamental importance of this agreement. The UK can now progress new data legislation, such as the crucial National Data Strategy, knowing that a high-standards and innovation-focussed approach rests in harmony with the European perspective. We look forward to a strong relationship with Europe and the rest of the world in matters of data transfers and standards.‚ÄùTegel Take Outs Southern Style Chicken Tenders 600g

Want to be a part of preserving a part of aviation history for generations to come? Get involved and make a donation to the Tri-Motor Heritage Foundation today!
While modern engineering in the aeronautical sector has brought many advantages to plane design, the Port Clinton, OH-based heritage charity has just announced a new funding initiative to continue the restoration of a 1929 Ford aircraft. The non-profit is committed to preserving the legacy of America‚Äôs aviation industry.
Play your part in bringing the rich history of the Lake Erie region to life. Help the Tri-Motor Heritage Foundation achieve lift-off! More details at
The announcement details the progress made to date on the Tri-Motor project. The plane was a former mainstay of the Island Airlines fleet, damaged in service during Hurricane Andrew. The project aims to restore the airplane to flight-ready condition with the aim of seeing it take to the skies once more.
The Tri-Motor first took off in the Lake Erie Islands region in 1936. The arrival of air travel gave islanders a new year-round solution to getting to and from the mainland quickly and comfortably. This classic Ford aircraft was capable of carrying large payloads and was regularly put to use as a freight hauler, mail plane, school bus, and hearse among other applications. Another advantage of the Tri-Motor was its short takeoff and landing ability, ideal for the short island runways.
The Tri-Motor Heritage Foundation aims to raise enough funds to not only restore the Ford to its former glory but also acquire other related aircraft memorabilia. The organization is committed to educating the public on the importance and development of this plane, bringing history to life through an expertly curated collection of aviation-related items. You can ensure the project‚Äôs success by making even a small contribution.
There are a number of ways that you can support the project. You can make a tax-deductible donation directly via the website through PayPal. The foundation also offers you the opportunity to sponsor a seat on the aircraft. A brass placard bearing your name will be displayed on the seat.

The project originated in 2004 when Tri-Motor expert Maurice Hovious offered local pilot Ken Benjamin and his fellow enthusiasts the opportunity to begin an actual re-build of the famous aircraft. The plane is housed at a dedicated hangar in the Liberty Aviation Museum in Port Clinton.
A spokesperson says, ‚ÄúWhether you attend an event, buy a souvenir, or volunteer your time, there are many opportunities to contribute to our success.‚Äù
With the launch of its latest funding initiative, the Tri-Motor Heritage Foundation continues to invest in the preservation of Island Airlines‚Äô rich history.
With just a few dollars, on a wing and a prayer, watch a Ford Tri-Motor take to the air. Find out more here:

Our Mission:
At eVillageCare, we take pride in being a leader that provides outstanding concierge health services to homebound and elderly patients. Thanks to our compassionate care, vast experience and outstanding support, we ensure that every clients of ours gets a treatment that is tailored to their most exact needs.
Dr. Ming Li Tsang and EVillage Care:
Pioneering a modern idea in a world full of elderly care services, it was Dr. Ming Li Tsang who first set the cornerstone of eVillage Care as a company. Inspired by his youth days and the specialization in his mom's nursing home facility in Hong Kong, Dr. Ming Li Tsang made his passion in elderly care medicine official with the foundation of eVillage Care as the one-stop destination for elderly care to the senior community.
It was exactly the advanced technology, vast experience and broad interest in elderly care that has set eVillage Care apart from the competition. In a current health system that does not provide adequate care for the elderly patients, Dr. Ming Li Tsang saw a great opportunity and took advantage of the lack of support and adequate care in the senior community.
In a system that suffers from lack of coordination and a lot of confusion, eVillage Care steps in as the go-to service of all homebound patients seeking for professional care at affordable prices. Without the need to check in to emergency care whenever a health problem occurs, our platform connects patients with experts and takes the health awareness to the next level.
Another benefit of our tailored senior care services is the social support which is key when it comes to coordinated care from both the caregivers and family members. These two core values definitely add up to the truly personal patient experience that Dr. Tsang instilled into the company spirit when founding eVillage Care.
At the end of the day, senior care is all about going the extra mile, providing a quality of life and being able to offer a placement in a community that supports and coordinates every aspect of modern medicine for elderly patients.

I remember reading Charlotte‚Äôs Web together with my class when I was younger. And last year, Benjamin did the same thing. After, his class watched this very movie and Benjamin came home excited to describe the book and movie to me. I couldn‚Äôt help but grin when he admitted that the movie was good, but the book was better.
And whether your children have read the book and seen the movie, or are brand new to this classic story, this set makes a great Christmas gift. So, to get you started on holiday gift giving, one lucky Mommy Kat and Kids reader is going to win the Charlotte‚Äôs Web Limited Edition Gift Set, a value! To enter to win, just leave a blog comment about whether your children know the touching story yet or not.
Often, one of the best things about my boys discovering the same things I loved as a child is that it lets me experience them again as well. And that‚Äôs definitely true with this gift set! I was excited to surprise my son with it, but I also immediately borrowed the book for a day so that I could read through it again too. Find the gift set at Walmart and other select stores across Canada, and introduce your little ones to a story that‚Äôs been loved for generations.

my kids know and love Charlottes Web
My children all knew the story of Charlotte‚Äôs Web. Each night while they brushed their teeth I would read a chapter from a book. As long as they were brushing I would read. We alternated between Charlotte‚Äôs Web, Where The Red Fern Grows and The Incredible Journey, so they were reread many years over the years to them. I would love to share this with my grandchildren.
Not sure if my grandkids know the story but my son does.
My kids do know the Charlotte‚Äôs Web story, both from the book and the movie.Coir products are derived from coconut husks and now in their many forms offer a great peat-free alternative for the ecologically-aware gardener.
There was a time when coconuts were harvested only for their scrumptious flesh and delicious juice inside. The rest was considered a waste product.
Thankfully for an ever-growing number of discerning gardeners, the natural fibre extracted from the husk of the coconut, found between the hard inner shell and the outer coating has now made a real impact as a plausible and increasingly popular alternative to peat-based products.
Coir (pronounced Coy-er) ticks several boxes as being 100 per cent biodegradable and natural, and therefore the basis of an increasing number of products which cause minimal harm to the environment.
Its arrival on the market with a range of coir-based products is tempting gardeners to work more with this natural product.
Coir mulch is a renewable resource, unlike peat moss, which comes from non-renewable, diminishing peat bogs.
Coir goes by many names. You may find it labelled as coir-peat, coco-peat, coir fibre pith, coir dust, and other similar-sounding names. It is made from the pith found between the coconut fibres. The coir pith gets washed, heat-treated, sieved to remove large particles, and graded. Very often it is compressed into blocks or bricks, which need to be soaked before using. You may also find growbags or bales of coir. Its impact in the gardening market is now substantial and is becoming more accessible and affordable.
Coir is native to most of the Asia pacific region, especially India and Sri Lanka where coconut is produced in large quantities and exported through the world. Recently the global annual production of coir has been estimated at 650,000 and is becoming a product much in demand.
It has several advantages over peat.
Water retention ‚Äì Coir mulch holds 30 percent more water than peat. It absorbs water easily and drains well. This is an important benefit in drought-plagued areas, as use of mulch may reduce water use in the garden by as much as 50 percent.
Soil amendment ‚Äì Coir is versatile in improving.
CoirProducts is the first company in the UK and Northern Ireland to offer the wide range of coir-based products. Updates to the ways coir can be used in the garden are continuously being made, creating a variety of products easily available to anyone who needs them.
All the CoirProducts are ethically produced and sourced, helping a garden to be healthy and eco-friendly. The collection includes items such as:
Coir Pots ‚Äì much in demand now and an ideal way to grow plants without having to put them through any transplanting shock- they can just be placed in the soil and the roots penetrate through the pot and grow through it. The pots are available in a range of sizes.
Coco Peat ‚Äì a multi-use growing medium.
CoirCoins ‚Äì compressed coco peat pellets perfect for sowing and seeding.
Coir Mulch Mats ‚Äì which can be used for weed control, or as pot toppers.
Coir Bricks ‚Äì solid bricks of coconut fibre which expands through soaking in water to produce high quality fibre.
And coir has been adapted to offer, Coir Discs, Growbags, Growcubes, Coir Sheets, and Coir Netting to name a few more, CoirProducts has all the essentials to get your garden flourishing.
Working within a competitive industry, as a company, CoirProducts is not merely profit-driven, but takes pride in helping communities and sharing knowledge.
For example, CoirProducts supports Chestnut Tree House, a children‚Äôs hospice charity that supports over 300 children and young adults in Sussex, by contributing a portion of every purchase towards them. Back at the factory, corporate social responsibility programmes focus on helping local children, and the work also supports the cottage industry, contributing towards rural economic development.

The follow-up to the successful 1975/early 1976 releases ‚Äî the Grammy-nominated ‚ÄúOne Of These Nights‚Äù and the huge-selling ‚ÄúEagles: Their Greatest Hits 1971-1975‚Äù ‚Äî ‚ÄúHotel California‚Äù was the first album to feature guitarist Joe Walsh, whose playing and songwriting influence brought the band from its one week) and make (born John Kosh) has always appreciated a challenge (and a nice production budget). When the Eagles‚Äô manager and record label called looking for an image to properly illustrate the release of a record by a ‚Äúnew‚Äù Eagles band ‚Äî.
THE EAGLES during ‚ÄúHotel California‚Äú introduced guitarist Joe Walsh (middle) to the fold. Walsh brought a heavier rock sound to an album, which won a Grammy in 1977 for Record of the Year. Photo courtesy of Rhino
‚ÄúAfter a six-month stint in New York, the family moved to L.A. in 1974 and I soon fell ‚Äî with great enthusiasm ‚Äî into the West Coast music scene. Heady times. I began working with Peter Asher [Apple] ‚ÄòHotel California‚Äô ‚Äî destined to be the first cut on, and the title of, their next album. It was an obvious hit.
‚ÄúFor the album cover, Don wanted me to find and portray the Hotel California ‚Äî a hotel which would best exemplify a classic ‚ÄòCal-footophouse, called The Lido, in Hollywood by David Alexander. Nobody knows what the sinister figure lurking in the balcony window is doing, or who he is. I assume he must have been a benign spirit as ‚ÄòHotel California‚Äô went platinum immediately.
‚ÄúIt is interesting to note that I got tangled in the same heated debate with Asylum Records over the using of the band‚Äôs name on the cover that I had years earlier with EMI in London. I thought it unnecessary to use the words, The Beatles on ‚ÄòAbbey Road,‚Äô considering the album was so eagerly anticipated and they were the biggest band in the world at the time. Such was the case with ‚ÄòHotel California.‚Äô By 1976 the Eagles were the biggest band in the world and eventually only the title, ‚ÄòHotel California‚Äô appeared on the original cover of the album.
‚ÄúSubsequently, as the sales of ‚ÄòHotel California‚Äô went through the roof, lawyers for The Beverly Hills Hotel threatened me with a ‚Äòcease and desist‚Äô action ‚Äî until it was gently pointed out by my attorney that the hotel‚Äôs requests for bookings had tripled since the release of the album.

1. Have you heard of The Skimm? I get their daily emails and it‚Äôs been a great way to start my days! I wish I could use the app, it looks pretty handy, but they charge for the subscription, so I am sticking with the emails right now.
2. I think I saw this recommended by someone on their blog (can‚Äôt remember who it was. Was it you?) and decided to give it a try. The Garnier Fructis Style Pure Clean Detangler + Air Dry is meant to detangle and smooth your hair when you let it air-dry (which I do on the weekends). I have also used it as a leave-in treatment before blow-drying my hair at the gym and I really like it. My hair is very fine, so it doesn‚Äôt tolerate heavy products very well, but it‚Äôs been handling this just fine (plus, it smells good).
3. I looove Arugula. I‚Äôll have it in salads, I recently added it to a cooked dinner (just at the very end, so it doesn‚Äôt wilt), and I love it on top of pizza. I need to find more ways to eat it though. Maybe just plain by the handful? Don‚Äôt mind if I do!
4. Yeah, yeah, even if I am a little grumpy and mostly sad that Germany didn‚Äôt make it through the group stage at the FIFA World Cup this year (I don‚Äôt even want to talk about it), I love the excitement of the tournament. I haven‚Äôt decided who I am going to cheer for now, but I‚Äôll try to catch a few matches of the knock-out stage and then we‚Äôll see who will become the next world champion!
5. Have you heard of the Pomodoro Technique? I am trying it out at work to get some more uninterrupted, focused work done and the BeFocused app is really helpful (and visually pleasing). 25 minute-blocks of focusing on the task at hand and not looking at email or checking my phone. What‚Äôs your strategy to stay focused?
6. I love this Run because I can muscle shirt from Miles & Pace. I actually won this shirt in a Instagram Giveaway. It‚Äôs really nice and soft and great for summer running.
7. Here it is, our tiny little Weber Q1000 grill that I‚Äôve been loving these last few weeks. It‚Äôs a small, portable camping size, but just perfect for two people.

I‚Äôve become more and more impressed with the MacBook I‚Äôve been evaluating. Between reader comments and the things an Apple rep has showed me, I‚Äôm starting to really see the appeal of OS X.
The much-touted ease of use is really there. With no more instruction than ‚Äúclick here and here,‚Äù my son has fallen in love with PhotoBooth. The picture above is one of many he took while playing around, and he often asks me if he can play with the MacBook. I‚Äôm looking forward to showing him the Comic Life demo I downloaded.
I‚Äôll be talking more about my MacBook experiences in the future, but for now I have to wonder, where are the Vista apologists?
I write a single post about my Mac experiences, and I‚Äôm swamped with comments and traffic spikes. There was no zealotry, just helpful advice and encouraging words. Meanwhile I‚Äôve slagged Windows, especially Vista, several times, and there‚Äôs hardly a peep from my readership.
I‚Äôm on an email list for Illinois technology educators that has hundreds of members, and there‚Äôs a lot of talk about Vista headaches ranging from poor printer and hardware support to it being a massive resource hog. There are a few people who claim to like it, but they‚Äôre more interested in some of the administrative or security tools than anything a user might get excited about. Or, if they do like Vista in general, they have either turned off several features or they just accept the system‚Äôs quirks.
I read a column recently (I wish I could find it) that made a great point: Mac users love their systems. Windows users, meanwhile, just grit their teeth and reboot. This is why guys like John Roling, a former Windows power user, suddenly become Mac enthusiasts. This is why guys like me start exploring other options like Linux, and are willing to at least entertain the notion of purchasing a Mac.
This is why Dell and IBM are forced to offer XP as an option on their systems, and Vista was only installed on 39% of all PCs sold last year. This is why Best Buy is doubling the number of stores stocking Mac products this month.
The only thing the Windows, Mac and Linux camps can agree on is DRM and proprietary multimedia formats suck.
In the meantime, I ask again, where are the Vista apologists? If you‚Äôre out there, speak.18.49 inc. VAT(¬£15.41 ex. VAT)

Templates for creating your online dating profile for dating sites
While we really think that it‚Äôs better to be original on online dating sites, we can understand that sometimes it‚Äôs hard to come up with something that will get you results. That‚Äôs why we‚Äôve got some online dating profile examples just for you.
These are the kind of profiles that would work best on a serious website for meeting someone. That means services like OkCupid, Match.com, and eHarmony. For dating app profiles, check out further down!
Funny Profiles
There‚Äôs nothing that makes for better conversation starters than a funny profile. It can be wacky and leave a really lasting impression on potential matches. A good funny profile can also show others that you‚Äôre the kind of person who knows when to relax and have fun.
Nobody wants to be around someone uptight, after all!
Here‚Äôs a rough example you can follow, just tweak it to how you see fit:
About myself: You‚Äôre obviously hooked on my pictures, but here‚Äôs the dirty deeds about me to distract yourself with. I‚Äôm typically hitting the gym when I‚Äôm not killing it with managing investments. I normally don‚Äôt have a lot of time for that because of all the heart surgeries I do.
When I do get time off, I spend my days parachuting into volcanos and skiing down the sides to where villagers always wait for me like I‚Äôm some kind of hero. Maybe I killed some angry volcano god doing sick tricks, who knows.
Anyway, I‚Äôm really picky‚Ä¶ about getting my steak extremely rare. Other than that I‚Äôm super chill. You can hook up with me anywhere I want, maybe an airplane or something? I‚Äôd say one of the islands I visit normally but I don‚Äôt speak their gibberish languages.
Of course, you are running a big gamble with something like a funny profile. For starters, there‚Äôs a chance that people won‚Äôt take you seriously at all. It can also fall flat and leave people with a bad first impression. As you know, there‚Äôs nothing worse than a bad comedian.
It can be difficult to give an exact template for how you should approach a funny profile. A funny profile should be something that you use if you want to show that you are, in fact, a funny person. That means being able to think on your feet and being funny on your own.
If you use a guide for that and someone finds out you aren‚Äôt actually all that funny, it can be kind of misleading. In this case, it would be better to go with a more direct approach. Of course, there‚Äôs also the cute approach.
Cute Profiles
Cute profiles are something that you have to be able to pull off naturally, as your own personal cuteness will really have to play a role here. It‚Äôs not something you can really fake, so don‚Äôt try it unless you know that you can play up a cute profile.
On the other hand, a cute profile is something that a lot of singles find attractive. It‚Äôs something where they will want to see more of you if it goes off without a hitch. On top of a really cute profile picture though, being quirky can help to :
About myself: Hi there! My name is ___ and if you were to ask my friends, they would tell you that I‚Äôm a little goofy. Even if that‚Äôs true, I‚Äôm usually the responsible one! I think that comes from taking care of my dog Biggles for so long, so I hope you like pups!
I have to say that I‚Äôm really psyched to find someone who is just as excited about bargain hunting as I am. You know, going to Goodwill or something like that and rummaging for wacky clothes and offbeat antiques. Fair warning, I‚Äôm pretty experienced so you‚Äôll have to keep up!
Also, my ideal date is something where we can have a bit of fun and get to know each other. I would love to take a trip somewhere and maybe enjoy some fun sites. I should also say that I love to take pictures, so anywhere we can enjoy some photography would be a blast!
Of course, we‚Äôll have to bring Biggles!
Feel free to be as creative as possible when it comes to showing off your cute, quirky, and sweet side. You can also highlight work you might do that tells people what kind of person you are, like hobbies, interest, and more.
To repeat, a cute profile really relies on its pictures to emphasize the points in the actual bio. Make sure that any pictures you use here emphasize that!
Clever Profiles
If there is one kind of profile that is really going to stand out to online daters, it‚Äôs a clever, witty dating profile. This is where you can really shine with your creativity, and where spontaneous reactions aren‚Äôt vital to pass off a comedic profile.
This is also a great way to go if you are someone who is over 50 and looking for a profile that doesn‚Äôt rely on being cute!
This is really the sort of profile that you can make if you have time to come up with something that you think will really work. It can either be a direct approach or it can be a profile that makes a good joke while working to show off your best attributes.
Here‚Äôs an example of what we mean:
About myself: I‚Äôm currently looking to start dating seriously. I mean that, I may have taken it kind of lightly before but I promise that I want to commit to dating. That could mean you, if you want to go that extra mile with me.
I don‚Äôt always know what to say to keep the ball rolling though, so I‚Äôm going to have to rely on you right here and now to drop me a line. I‚Äôm single, healthy, and active, so I‚Äôm also in good shape. I like to read and enjoy going out when I‚Äôm not doing some Netflix and chill.
Now the ball is in your court. I want to hear about you: what makes you tick, what your interests are, and if you‚Äôre going to be willing to go that extra mile with me.
A good tip for your clever approach is to refer to the profile picture you use. If there‚Äôs a flaw or something, own it and draw attention to it. For example, if you happen to be in a wheelchair, you could write ‚ÄúCan‚Äôt stand waiting to meet you!‚Äù
The sky‚Äôs the limit, and as long as you are open about yourself and willing to be candid about any flaws you might have, you‚Äôll go a long way to making a clever profile.
Catchy Profiles
Catchy profiles can be your best friend when you are out looking to date. We would recommend really emphasizing something that you‚Äôre passionate about, or maybe if you have an unusual passion. You should try to work in a little bit of clever wit if you can.
After all, what better place to put something surprising out there than a dating profile? Give people that little known fact about yourself to really get their attention. There‚Äôs a good reason for this too!
You see, even if being really specific about yourself in your profile turns away potential dates, the flipside is that the people who do respond to, say, your PSN trophy collection, will be far more compatible with you than your typical dater. Here‚Äôs an example:
About myself: As someone who is an avid fan of Warhammer, you should know that I like to really let my artistic side shine through in the miniatures that I paint. I do prefer the Empire when it comes to playing table-top, even though they can be a little dull.
Better than Tau though!
I‚Äôm also someone who enjoys getting together with friends and new people to play dungeons and dragons. We do a weekly campaign session and I would love to ask you to come along, if you‚Äôd be interested in giving it a whirl!
On top of that, I‚Äôm a big reader of fantasy books and I really like to cook a lot of different dishes. Mostly, I try to do a lot of Japanese cuisine, but I‚Äôm also really big into Middle-eastern and Arabic dishes as well!
Really, don‚Äôt feel like you need to hide any sort of quirky or nerdy things about yourself. Do the opposite. Focus on these things about yourself and try to attract the kind of people who actually mesh with you as a person.
The absolute No-Go‚Äôs for dating profiles
Now, we want to discuss some no-go‚Äôs for your bio. These are things that come up as red flags to other users that they shouldn‚Äôt message you, so really keep these points in the back of your mind:
- Don‚Äôt fixate on just yourself in the profile as this can come off as being self-absorbed. Also, don‚Äôt fixate on the potential dater either! That seems creepy and controlling from the get-go.
- Whatever you do, don‚Äôt be boring. Try not to rely on adjectives to describe yourself too much or use clich√©s as a crutch.
- Remember to proofread your writing! This is the first impression someone will have of you when they look at your profile and at you, so try to avoid any errors!
- Avoid being negative. This is absolutely not the place to vent your frustrations with your love life, the service you are using, past relationships, troubles you have, or anything like that. Negativity might get you sympathy, but it won‚Äôt get someone interested in you.
With that in mind, let‚Äôs look at some things you CAN do to make your profile a little easier to write and to help it stand out some more.
The golden rule to dating on the go
Tinder is excellent if you are looking for a one night stand, but it can work if you want to try and start a long-term relationship. Bumble and hinge are better for that though. In any case, you need to sell yourself! Think of yourself as a product here.
What primary keywords define who you are? Are you an athlete? Creative? Passionate? On top of that, what is the person who will want to date you (the consumer) getting out of you? Fun times? Quiet romantic evenings? Partying and more?
Think of a bio as an advertisement and you‚Äôll see dating in a whole new light. Being concise with this kind of approach really encourages fast decision making with finding a match, and there‚Äôs nothing wrong with that.
Swiping to find a match is the new norm, and many dating apps have adopted it as their way of helping you to find matches. Fortunately for you, you don‚Äôt have to worry about new styles each time, as the best tinder bios work on all of them.
But what if you want something more serious? In the following, we‚Äôve split up some advice on how you can best focus your bio on either a service like Tinder, or something like Bumble or hinge.
When it comes to tinder and other hookup apps
If you are looking into an app that is even at all like Tinder, odds are you want someone to swipe right on you for fun rather than commitment. That‚Äôs why it is important to get to the point.
Although applicable for creating any bio, our number one dating profile tip works especially well with hookup apps: focus on three points about yourself. Be clear and concise with these ideas.
Seriously, this is a practical tip for either websites with lengthier bios, or with mobile apps that use shorter ones. It helps you focus on the big things about yourself.
The reason for this is that you can anchor a lot of information into your profile with just three points. Additionally, the rule of threes applies very often to things in western society, and people like it when information comes in sets of three:
About myself: Enjoy making music, amateur woodcarver, and working my way up the corporate ladder.
So list three interesting things about yourself as you can see above, such as your interests, hobbies, and goals to both fill people in on the most important parts about who you are, and to give them ample opportunity to spark a conversation with you.
If you are using a more casual service you can just leave the bio at that. This is generally a good basic place to start. With a more serious dating website you can take these three points as anchors for fleshing out more information.
You can also think of movie quotes that might catch someone‚Äôs attention. These are usually good for at least breaking the ice, and
About myself: Here‚Äôs looking at you kid.
It isn‚Äôt as informative, but you can still stand out with something as simple as this. Of course, you won‚Äôt necessarily find a perfect match doing this, but it can work. Alternatively, you could tell them to ask you a question about something that interests you:
About myself: Ask me about my favorite ingredients.
This can also grab someone‚Äôs focus, and it gives them a point to ask you something about yourself that you enjoy or find interesting. We prefer this to the movie quote approach, but our favorite is still the three point approach.
Something like bumble or hinge
Unlike a bio you might use for a tinder profile, bumble bios should go that extra mile to show that you really are interested in something other than sex. There‚Äôs some flexibility with Bumble, of course, but Hinge is pretty clear on its aim of creating lasting, meaningful relationships.
As such, a good hinge or bumble profile should expand on the idea above about including three interesting hobbies or things about yourself. You should still use these as the focal point of your bio, but absolutely expand on them. Here‚Äôs an example:
About myself: I really enjoy making music using different kinds of instruments, from guitars to keyboards. I‚Äôve recorded a few things that sound pretty good and have gotten some traction as well. I am also an amateur woodcarver, and have tried to work that hobby into both designing instruments (or at least modifying them as I can) and for around the house. It‚Äôs a really practical skill that looks great and gives me a lot of benefits at home. During my day job, I‚Äôm working my way up the corporate ladder with business development for a company. I‚Äôm not sure I‚Äôll stay with it, but the experience has been pretty rewarding so far!
That means providing more detail and information. Of course, you shouldn‚Äôt give everything away either. You want to leave some room in your bio for your potential love interest to ask you questions.
That said, with a more serious platform, we think it is best if you don‚Äôt lean in too hard on either movie quotes or ‚Äúask me about XYZ‚Äù. Better to be real and honest from the get-go. That said, feel free to spice it up with some comedy, something catchy, or even a dash of cuteness.
Getting into the right mindset for a great profile
It isn‚Äôt easy to get into a proper mindset for dating profile writing. Sometimes you can just feel stumped or overwhelmed with possibilities, and you put too much pressure on it. Sure, it‚Äôs a big thing for online dating, but you first need to relax and remember to be honest and be yourself.
This is about pitching you as a person to others. You don‚Äôt want to promise one thing to another person and then offer up something else, same as you wouldn‚Äôt want to meet someone who you thought would be one thing but is entirely something else!
That‚Äôs false advertisement, if we continue with our analogy.
Fortunately for you, you‚Äôre the expert on you. No matter who mundane you may think some of your biggest selling points are, these are still the things about yourself that make you you. Be proud of who you are and what your interests are, and that will encourage matches most.
Nevertheless, here‚Äôs a step-by-step on how you can generally approach each part of writing a profile.
Opening Lines
You shouldn‚Äôt get too wrapped up in the opening line of your bio, but remember that it is important. A lot of people focus on this part after looking at someone‚Äôs profile pic, and so it should at the very least get their attention.
The best way to do this is to either start by immediately introducing yourself. This can either be your name, your profession, or something interesting about you that you feel defines yourself.
Alternatively, you can use a call to action to get their attention, maybe by asking them to do something and then giving them a way to respond. ‚ÄúAsk me about my parrot, swipe right and send me a message.‚Äù
Introduce Yourself
As with your opening, take a moment to really paint a picture for the other person. What are you like? What do you like to do? Do you have any favorite foods, hobbies, or interests? What about things you want to try?
Really try to capture the essence of who you are and put it out there in a way where they will be able to get a clear idea at a glance. It‚Äôs important to be honest here as well, as a lot of the matching process boils down to how you fill out these kinds of sections on your bio.
If you aren‚Äôt sure about what to write, a good approach can be to ask a friend or family member to describe you in a positive way. If you would rather do it yourself, take a look around your home and make notes of your hobbies and how they make you feel.
You can take these notes and put them into a bullet-point list to organize your thoughts. Then, just work them into your bio.
Picture your dream partner
Whether you are using free dating or a paid service, you will inevitably have to describe the kind of partner you would like to have. It‚Äôs important here to be honest, otherwise you run the risk of matching with people you don‚Äôt really want to.
Think about characteristics that you would like your partner to have: are they tall or short? What about weight? Age? Do you want to date a specific ethnicity or are you flexible? What about their hobbies and profession? Do you want kids?
You don‚Äôt have to get all the answers for these upfront, but giving at least a general idea on the type of person you want to date will help filter out unwanted matches.
Wrapping up your hard work
As you know, your bio is the prime real estate for meeting people and putting out everything about yourself to entice people. It should give them enough to satisfy their initial question of whether or not to message you while also leaving them enough room to ask questions.
Try to round off your profile with something funny or interesting. The bigger the hook the better your odds of landing someone that is interested in dating you. You don‚Äôt want to sound robotic after all, so it‚Äôs good to let some light-hearted humor in, and preferably toward the end.
This leaves the other person looking at your bio with a more positive, lasting impression. That‚Äôs vital for making more connections online.
How to pick the right picture for your dating profile
We‚Äôve mentioned this a few times, but one of the best pieces of online dating advice that we can give is to get the best profile photos possible. A great pic will do a lot for selling you on a dating platform, and it gives a lot of context to the way you will write your bio.
Case in point, if you are an amateur painter and want to make a funny profile about that, you should include some sort of picture of you that shows you painting. At the same time, even if it is funny, it should clearly show you and put you in the best light possible.
This kind of context gives people something to go off of when they read through your bio. Additionally, if your picture doesn‚Äôt relate to what you write at all, it can create a disconnect and put people off.
No matter if you are doing something clever or funny, avoid that kind of confusion!
As for the actual profile picture, you should either ask your best friend or someone close to really get a good photo, or consider going to a professional photographer. There are many services that can help you get exactly what you want, and one picture can go a long way.
Profile writing can take some time, and so can finding the right picture. Take your time and make sure you are happy with both. You can always update either later on if you feel like it could be better!Description

Eleni and her son Simeon are from Kalamafka, an inland village near Ierapetra on the southern coast of eastern Crete. Their land rises towards the high spine of Crete, and the trees stand on well-drained terraces,fed by spring water.The earth is stonier than in the middle part of the island, more volcanic, the cliffs made of strange rock formations.
Other farmers focus on quantity, Eleni has solved for quality. She talk slovingly of her trees, the inheritance she received from her family which she plans to pass to Simeon, who studies agronomy himself. They consume their own productat home.She‚Äôs independent and single minded; as trong woman in the largely male world of olive farming. Simeon brings the latest developments in agronomy to their production. He‚Äôs studying the subject at the University of Heraklion. They are the guardians of their trees and they look after their every need.
Elenis known in the area for innovative natural farming techniques.Instead of pesticide she sprays chalky mineral solutions on leaves and fruit to put off pests. She is careful with water in the summer; the olive fly prefers fat, wet fruit. While she doesn‚Äôt have full bio certification, Eleni and Simeon use only organic products in their stewardship of their trees.
The result is an olive oil of truly excellent quality, with low acidity and impeccable taste characteristics, which carries the rare and precious ‚ÄúHigh Polyphenolic‚Äù label. It‚Äôs the top of our range.

Why Sodus?
Why Van Slyck Road?
When Sheniqua Cabiness' body ‚Äî wrapped tightly in a curtain and tied off "in a professional manner" ‚Äî was found in a ditch along Van Slyck Road 30 miles from her Rochester home in April 1998, there were many questions for her mother and police investigators.
Sheniqua, 18, had disappeared two months earlier; she'd left with a friend and told her mother they were going to meet other friends ‚Äî men they'd known from the neighborhood.
Her mother never saw her daughter alive again.
As witnesses recoiled from police and refused to help their investigation, the case itself lost traction between two departments (it was an open homicide for Wayne County Sheriff's Department and a missing person case for Rochester police). The investigation grew cold shortly after her body was found near a drainage pipe and road sign warning that there was a dangerous curve ahead.
Months turned into years, witnesses stayed mum and the questions remained unanswered ‚Äî the most nagging always this: Why was the body dumped on that open, rural road in Wayne County?
What was the connection to a young, often-struggling single mother who'd spent her entire life on the westside of Rochester?
Sixteen years later, prosecutors believe they have the answer ‚Äî thanks to dogged work by a police investigator and the new willingness of once-reluctant witnesses.
And they have their suspect:
On Wednesday, Hubart "Paul" Sirmons, 39, was arraigned before state Supreme Court Justice Alex Renzi and pleaded not guilty to a second-degree murder charge. He's now accused of shooting Sheniqua Cabiness once in the head Feb. 25, 1998, and leaving her body in a ditch on a desolate road in Wayne County.
A road with which he was very familiar.
'A free spirit'
Sheniqua was getting her general equivalency diploma in the winter of 1998. She was caring for her 2-year-old son and renting a home of her own.
"She was a free spirit person, a happy go-girl," said her mother, Rochelle Cabiness. "She didn't let anybody mess with her mom. She was like my best friend because she was my first child. We were very close."
Those things changed in the months before she disappeared, her mother said.
"Once she met them, it was all over with then," Cabiness said, recalling friends of Sheniqua's, whom she blames for the changes. "She started going out. At 18, most kids were going out to clubs, but she wasn't doing that. She was with me, but when she met them, that all changed.
"They just took over her life."
Several of those friends moved into Sheniqua's home and started selling drugs, her mother said.
"I told Sheniqua, 'Come on home, leave the furniture, leave everything, let them have it.' It wasn't worth her life, and they were eventually going down. I told her she was going to go down with them if she didn't get out.
"And she did. And once she came home, they stopped calling her."
But not for long, her mother said.
She'd only been with her mother at her home on Clay Street about a week when some of her friends got arrested for selling drugs and they reached out again to her daughter.
On Feb. 25, Sheniqua planned on going out with friends, but her mother asked her to stay a little later at the house to watch a child for whom she provided day care.
Sheniqua waited for her mother to return home from the store and then she left, wearing some gold jewelry and a blue shirt. She was going, Rochelle recalls, to meet Sirmons, who had dated one of Sheniqua's friends but who had apparently turned his eyes on her daughter.
"She left and she never came back," Cabiness said. "I'd heard about Paul. I heard Paul was supposed to be some real bad boy, go rob people and just take what he wanted."
When Sheniqua's body was found April 12, 1998, by children who'd been playing nearby and who began to untie the bundle when an arm slipped out, Sheniqua was wearing the same outfit her mother last saw her in.
"She still had on all her clothing, and in addition to the clothing she was last seen wearing, she has a pair of Levi's 550 jeans over the top of her own clothes," said First Assistant District Attorney Kelly Wolford. "They are clearly men's jeans, not the right size for her."
She was identified by the medical examiner; her body was in "relatively good condition since it had been out there since February," Wolford said. "When it's cold and kept all bound up, it stayed pretty well-preserved.
"She was shot once in the head. It's a downward trajectory of the bullet that goes front to back and downward from top to bottom. One gunshot wound to the head."
The investigation
No longer a missing person case, the investigation started in earnest for Rochester police when the body was found.
"At that point, they interview a whole bunch of people, including friends who she had been with that night who deny having knowledge of what happened to her," Wolford said.
But the streets, Wolford said, are saying that someone knows what happened. There are witnesses.
Still, no one cooperates with police and the witnesses "basically go underground," Wolford said.
Based on information from interviews, police obtained a warrant to search a home on Frederick Park where the murder was believed to have taken place. The home also was the target of a police drug investigation at the time.
Little was found that pointed to a murder, but the home was tied by paperwork to Sirmons.
Photographs were taken inside the home of the bedrooms, living areas and the kitchen. Unbeknownst to police at the time, the photographs would prove crucial to closing the case 16 years later.
"With no witness testimony to go on and little physical evidence, the case seems desperate," said Wolford. "When the case goes cold, it lays dormant for all that time, it just sort of lays there. There's no DNA, nothing out there that we're waiting on."
Fast-forward eight years, and Rochester police investigators Dave Simpson and Tom Janus are working on a federal investigation of gun and drug violence.
One of the investigation's targets: Sirmons.
"I just started looking into it based on some witness information and the word on the street that he was involved," Simpson said. "We started looking at people who had knowledge of it on drug charges, to see if that might help break the case."
Sirmons and 11 others were arrested in 2010 after almost a year-long investigation by federal and state authorities. He was involved in a drug conspiracy that was responsible for distributing large amounts of cocaine, crack cocaine and heroin in the Rochester area between 2008 and 2010.
In 2012, Sirmons, then 36,.
As he went off to federal prison, Simpson and Janus, and later Simpson's partner, Dave Giudici, continued to investigate Sirmons' potential role in Sheniqua's death.
Simpson dug into Sirmons' past. Past crimes. Past life. And through a familial connection, he learned that Sirmons hadn't lived in Rochester his whole life.
For most of his childhood and through the 10th grade, Sirmons lived in Sodus, on Peoples Road ‚Äî 500 yards from a drainage pipe and a road sign warning there was a dangerous curve ahead.
Investigators now believed they knew why Sheniqua's body was dumped in a remote stretch of road.
The once-cold case was finally heating up, but it wasn't until 2013 when an unrelated robbery would give investigators what they needed: Witnesses that put Sirmons at 55 Frederick Park ‚Äî with a gun in his hands.
'She didn't deserve to die'
Simpson and Wolford said they can reveal few details about the witnesses who will testify against Sirmons, but say those accounts place Sirmons at the home that night.
Those witnesses will testify, Wolford said, that Sirmons shot Sheniqua once in the head, wrapped up her body in a curtain and an extra pair of jeans, drove her to Van Slyck Road and left her in the ditch.
Wolford declined to reveal more about the investigation and won't comment on what prosecutors believe motivated the killing.
Assistant District Attorney Patrick Farrell, who will prosecute the case that has developed in stages during the past 16 years, said the case will rely heavily on circumstantial evidence ‚Äî testimony from the lead witness and paperwork linking Sirmons to the houses on Frederick Park and Peoples Road.
"Essentially, this case is going to boil down to witness accounts that place the suspect in and around the crime scene at the time that the crime occurred, and what we feel is a significant amount of circumstantial evidence corroborating witnesses' accounts," Farrell said.
For her part, Rochelle Cabiness said she is glad someone will face a trial in the death of her daughter, the oldest of her four girls.
A native of Detroit, she said she stayed in Rochester for seven years after the death, hoping that a killer would be identified. In 2005, she decided to go home and live with her family.
"I didn't have any more support (in Rochester) any more, so it was time to come home. I just left. Left everything, just left and came home."
It helps her to know that she and her grandson ‚Äî now a communications student at a college in Utica, who does not remember his mother ‚Äî will have the justice for which she's waited 16 years.
"It did take a long time, but it did come to the light. I'm so glad Simpson stayed on it," she said of the investigator to whom she credits the closure of the case.
"She didn't deserve to die, not for drugs, not for anything. It's been a long time, but I'll be there to see him in court."

However, before we could get a No. 1 vs. No. 2 SEC title game in Atlanta, the Tide had to navigate two more SEC West opponents in Arkansas and Auburn. Alabama was a three-touchdown favorite against the Razorbacks on Saturday, but found themselves in a tight battle in the fourth quarter thanks to Sam Pittman digging deep in the playbook for a wild fake field goal early in the fourth quarter. Pittman sent his kick team out on 4th & 9 for a long field goal and the Tide were in a field goal safe look, but still got fooled on a fake field goal jump pass from the holder.

‚Äî Arkansas Razorback Football (@RazorbackFB) November 20, 2021
It‚Äôs an unbelievable play by the tight end to reach back and haul in the pass, not only getting the first down but keeping his balance and rumbling for the touchdown to cut the Alabama lead to six. The design is beautiful and even takes advantage of the positioning of the officials, as the outside defender gets picked by the official as the tight end comes across the seam to create some added separation.12‚Äù to 20‚Äù.

ENGLISH 520 (SUMMER 2011)
REPRESENTATIONS OF LONDON IN EARLY MODERN ENGLISH
LITERATURE
For Class 1, please read Kagan, de Certeau, and the introduction to John Taylor‚Äôs The carriers cosmographie (STC 23740). I have partially edited Taylor‚Äôs text and posted it to the Library on MoEML You may also read it via Early English Books Online. If you are on campus or logged into the U.Vic. library system, click on the title to go directly to the bibliographic record for The carriers cosmographie; you may read either the page images or the diplomatic transcription.
MoEML will be an important part of our course. Browse the website, especially the Agas map, before our first class. The experimental map has much higher resolution and is easier to pan across. Note that the Ward boundaries (the purple lines) are not correct on the experimental map.
Questions on Critical Readings:
- de Certeau: Why is it pleasurable to look down upon a city? How is looking at a map like the experience of viewing a city from above? Any thoughts on how an early modern Londoner might experience a map given that they could not see the from a plane, skyscraper, or aerial photograph? What sorts of understandings are forged by viewing from above? from walking? Any thoughts (from your own experience) of how being a pedestrian tourist in a city and being a foot commuter in the same city are different/similar experiences? What‚Äôs it like to navigate on foot using a modern map? We will want to return to this chapter throughout Part I of the course, which is mainly about ways of imagining the city by walking its streets or routes. (JJ)
- Kagan: Make sure you understand Kagan‚Äôs three ways of conceptualizing a city (civitas, urbs, res publica). We will try to apply these terms to depictions of various early modern cities. Also note the difference between chorographic and communocentric views. We will want to deploy Kagan‚Äôs terms throughout the course. (JJ)

Aoi Bara no Chikara?) is the 10th episode of the season Yes! Pretty Cure 5 GoGo!, and also the 204th episode of the Pretty Cure franchise overall.
Contents
Synopsis
With the powers of evil growing stronger, Flora tells Pretty Cure to combine their powers of the Red Rose with the Blue. Just as things seem bleak, a mysterious figure debuts!
Summary
Everyone enjoys a snack at Natts House when the Rose Pact begins to shine. They wonder if something may be wrong with King Donuts, but he assures them he is fine. It's then Flora appears and tells them that within the darkness hatred is being born, and if it gathers further it will one day rip the petals of the Red Rose and destroy all hope. She asks the Cures to unite the powers of the Red Rose with the Blue Rose before taking off, but this leaves everyone confused.
Meanwhile, at Eternal, Scorp stayed the whole night to finish the report and was looking for Anacondy when he saw Bunbee eavesdropping. He scolded him and Bunbee said he heard something about an underground storage. Then Anacondy came out and Scorp gave her the report before taking off, causing Bunbee to trail behind him as Scorp claims that if they did nothing but write reports Eternal wouldn't keep people like that for long. In that case, such people are given job undeground for all eternity- wandering around in an endless labyrinth known as the Disposal Area. Bunbee starts panicking, saying he just transferred here, so Scorp suggests they partner up.
The follow day at school the girls think over what Flora told them. Nozomi remains as optimistic as usual when Syrup joins them to say that Eternal will do anything to achieve their goal. Coco tells him to trust Pretty Cure though, because they are the reason Palmier Kingdom was restored to begin with.
Later the girls note how cloudy the sky has gotten while waiting for Coco and Syrup. But suddenly Scorp arrives and they transform before curiously following after him. With this distraction he leads the Cures to another location- just as Syrup and Coco arrive to find them missing. They worry that they may have forgotten them, when Natts arrives to announce they didn't show up yet. Bunbee takes advantage of this moment to appear and capture the fairies.
As the Cures continue giving chase, Scorp suddenly stops when Bunbee appears next to him and reveals that he caught their fairies. Angered the girls try to attack, but their opponents are too strong for them.
Bunbee prepares to leave after deciding there is nothing left to do, when someone suddenly appears in a rush of blue rose petals. The mysterious girl with long purple hair, dressed in a white outfit appears and demands the fairies be released, then she jumps at them and kicks Bunbee, causing him to release them and allow her to catch them. She hands them over to Dream, telling her that this is not good enough before stopping a surprise attack when Bunbee attempts to strike from behind. She continues to speak, warning Dream that the most precious things are the things easily lost, and if this is really important for them they must work harder to protect it.
Taking her advice, the Cures resume the battle. Bunbee ends up near the girl and tries to shoot a rocket at her but she easily stops him. Before Scorp is able to try attacking her, Dream uses Shooting Star on him and they are forced to retreat for Eternal.
Tiredly Dream crashes to the ground but appears to be fine. Then the mysterious girl disappears; with the blue rose petals still floating in the air.
Major Events
- Scorp and Bunbee decide to work together in hopes of getting the Rose Pact.
- Coco and Natts are both revealed to be on the list for Eternal's collection.
- A mysterious warrior known as Milky Rose appears to assist the Cures against Scorp and Bunbee.

A renowned photographer and Nikon #Zcreator based in √ñstersund, Sweden, Strand captured the shot using a Z6 II with the brilliant Nikon Z 14-24mm f/2.8 S trinity lens, shooting at the 14mm wide end with a slow 15-second shutter speed, an aperture of f/5.6 and a low ISO200 sensitivity.
The resulting panoramic image was composited together from six separate exposures, to create the final shot.
"Have you ever seen a halo around the Moon? This fairly common sight occurs when high thin clouds containing millions of tiny ice crystals cover much of the sky," notes the description on the NASA website.
. Exactly how ice-crystals form in clouds remains a topic of research. In the featured image taken last week from √ñstersund, Sweden, a complete lunar halo was captured over snowy trees and rabbit tracks."
Strand is no stranger to having his astro work recognized by NASA, along with other respected outlets such as National Geographic. In fact, in 2016 PostNord (the postal service jointly owned by Sweden and Denmark) issued a series of stamps featuring his images of the Northern Lights.
On top of that, he was named Sweden's Astrophotographer of the Year in 2013 and 2016, and his credits include everything from Coldplay to the Discovery Channel to MSNBC. In short, his work is well worth checking out, so visit his website to see more of his stunning images!

Is CBD oil harmful? Is CBD oil great for me? Just how do I take CBD oil? Are all excellent inquiries. CBD oil reliable sources.
CBD Oil Reliable Sources
Today we‚Äôre most likely to be talking about CBD, oil, cannabidiol oil. I believe there‚Äôs a great deal of misconceptions concerning CBD oil around and also frankly, CBD oil reliable sources. I was really ignorant regarding CBD oil up until I started exploring it.
The big inquiry is what is CBD oil and very primarily, CBD oil is an oil that comes from a cannabis plant.
Currently wait a second ‚Ä¶
I thought cannabis was cannabis, you‚Äôre ideal in some sense. What makes CBD oil not marijuana oil? The cannabis plant, cannabis sativa species has two various kinds.
It has the ‚Äònot get you high‚Äô kind, which is called ‚Äòhemp‚Äô and also included in the cannabis plant, it‚Äôs thought about a marijuana plant.
So a excellent example for this would certainly be canine breeds. You have a domestic pet dog. CBD oil reliable sources. It‚Äôs one types different breeds, can reproduce with each other and create feasible spawn, however there‚Äôs different qualities within that types that alter types, although it‚Äôs all the same types the very same with the hemp in the cannabis plant.
CBD Oil Reliable Sources
So it‚Äôs even more of a spectrum from hemp to marijuana, all within the overarching umbrella of marijuana, Sativa plants.
To make sure that‚Äôs mosting likely to be an important difference because CBD oil generally comes from a hemp plant. The idea is you get a great deal of the benefits from a cannabis plant, yet without the THC element that is extremely high. That could give you a psychoactive are high.
So why do we also appreciate CBD? Why do we respect the marijuana plan as a whole? CBD oil reliable sources. Well, very essentially, cannabis and the cannabinoids that remain in it, engage with the endocannabinoid system in our body.
So this is a system in our body that are some related procedures that govern various facets of our body immune system of pain, receptors of our mood. If you get these particles in your body, it has some administration over those procedures.
- There are 3 points that can interact with your endocannabinoid system. CBD oil reliable sources. The first thing is, you have endogenous, or your body makes its own cannabinoids that interact keeping that system.
- The second is phyto-cannabinoids, which is a great deal we‚Äôre mosting likely to be speaking about below, which are cannabinoids. These molecules are extracted from plants Phyto plant cannabinoids, so those are molecules that include THC the psychedelic element in marijuana plants, however additionally cannabidiol or CBD. Another type of cannabinoid that doesn‚Äôt communicate with the receptors that obtain you high, however does a lot of the other things that engage with that endocannabinoid system.
- The 3rd point is laboratory acquired cannabinoids, so these are clinical compounds like Marinol that have been controlled by the FDA, yet likewise street drugs like flavor, which are laboratory manufactured THC.
That center team is really the emphasis of CBD oil, Phyto cannabinoids.
Is there any way we can remove this from a cannabis plant, put it in some type of automobile that enables it to get in the body, and with any luck amass a few of the favorable gain from the plant? That brings me to my next subject, which is CBD oil as a medicine.
Well, there was a lot of increased interest in 2008 when the FDA accepted a pure CBD.
Oil for epileptics, a rare kind of adolescent seizures, or pediatric seizure problems. They found that this CBD oil, in its most detoxified kind, might in fact reduce the amount of seizures these children were having, and so after a extensive trial as well as extensive security researches it was really accepted. CBD oil reliable sources. Now the public passion has actually come to a head to where they‚Äôre advising that we must check out this as well as see what advantages it might give.
CBD Oil Reliable Sources
The existing body of medical literature bordering CBD oil is a little thin, but there‚Äôs more and more things coming out and right now, there‚Äôs a great deal of pet researches checking out CBD oil and also pain and also state of mind in dependency. CBD oil reliable sources. I assume a whole lot is going to be appearing over the next couple of years, yet right now, a great deal of it is unscientific.
We gave it to 10 individuals and a great deal of them really felt better all the way approximately the much more energetic, randomized regulated trials, where you claim: let‚Äôs take CBD oil as well as compare it to another therapy for discomfort, our mood, or anxiety. And let‚Äôs see if it‚Äôs far better or equal to that treatment. CBD oil reliable sources. A lot of those randomized regulated tests were still waiting ahead out, yet we‚Äôre seeing a great deal of tiny dimension 10, 15, 20 individuals signed up in these tiny tests of CBD oil, where there are some actually interesting end results.
Another concern you should be asking is: is this things secure? Now the biggest security research was undoubtedly performed with the epileptics and the FDA approved CBD oil, however see other forms of CBD have had some smaller sized range safety researches and no significant damaging outcomes have truly appeared of those.
A couple of things they have noted is that it can interfere with some of your laboratory examinations, including your liver feature panels, and also it can also interfere, potentially with blood slimmers like Coumadin or anti-seizure medicines. It can impact the levels of those in your blood stream.
Okay, following topic legality. This is a bit of an progressing question. In 1970 the dangerous drug act, prohibited, cannabis, hemp and all associated products. They put it under the territory of the DEA, made it a legal substance. CBD oil reliable sources. It had not been till 2014, when an agricultural act was passed, additionally known as the ranch bill.
These gloves are also and also that legalized hemp for research functions, and also that was the bill that designated that the hemp plant, although still a cannabis plant, was legitimately defined as a plant that had much less than 0.3 percent THC consisted of in it. Currently, in 2018 there was some more development made when the 2018 type bill came out as well as said currently hemp and also hemp associated products like CBD oil are federally legal.
The tricky component is when we get down to a state degree, so you require to inspect your state standards because the government regulations still say the states can have administration over their own jurisdiction. If you plan on getting CBD oil, I would actually get down to the nuts and bolts of what your state says right now, so you intend to roll the dice and also try CBD oil.
CBD Oil Reliable Sources
What do I do? What I did? I pretended that I was somebody that intended to acquire CBD oil from Ground Zero, never ever checked out items, as well as I started investigating it online. CBD oil reliable sources.
The first thing I located was the FDA: did a study back in when was it 2017 and also they arbitrarily picked 84 online products and also they checked out the tags on the bottle.
So, oh, this item has 0.1 % THC as well as whatever percent CBD. What they found was only 26 of the 84 were labeled correctly, the trim was, there was a lot more THC than they claimed was in it and also there was less CBD than they stated.
There are also a number of case studies where youngsters took it as well as they were actually intoxicated with the THC from these CBD oils. CBD oil reliable sources. There‚Äôs been a bit more progress since then, now that it‚Äôs managed by the USDA and it‚Äôs not a abused substance any longer, there have actually been some patterns and the major pattern is that business that are creating CBD oil are sending their item every batch.
They brew it in a large pot. That‚Äôs not really just how it works, but that‚Äôs how I imagine in my mind and that set they send to a laboratory, that‚Äôs unassociated to the business, as well as they state you check this make certain it doesn‚Äôt have any kind of impurities in it like heavy metals and also see to it it has the amount of CBD, we claim it does as well as it has the amount of THC we state it does or none in any way.
A great deal of these business are linking those set records on their web site or also on the tag of their bottle. CBD oil reliable sources. It‚Äôs where you can conveniently access it and claim this is precisely what‚Äôs in this oil, so I‚Äôm mosting likely to speak about various products currently as well as some of the guidelines. I think you should comply with in choosing a CBD product if you intend on getting some and likewise what the difference in between different products is.
There are 3 different kinds of CBD:
‚Ä¢ Oil.
‚Ä¢ full-spectrum.
‚Ä¢ broad spectrum.
‚Ä¢ and then detoxified CBD oil.
So full spectrum is, if you take the blossom, the leaves you extract the oil and do not get rid of anything from it. There‚Äôs still a bit of THC, there‚Äôs CBD in it, but also there‚Äôs all the other parts of the plant which we generally categorize as a compound called terpenes. There are all different types of terpenes, so all of that remains in the product and the reason that they do. That is something called the entourage impact. Unlike typical pharmaceutical medicines that you could get for your diabetic issues or your high blood pressure, there is normally have one active component.
CBD Oil Reliable Sources
The entourage impact says we desire every one of the useful items within this plant into our item, due to the fact that there have been some small-scale research studies that show the CBD oil works best when there‚Äôs a little of terpene blended with it as well as when there‚Äôs may be even minuscule amounts of THC combined with it So somebody that wants every one of those products from the plant in their oil would be searching for a full spectrum oil. Broad spectrum is the whole plant, yet they eliminate every one of the THC from it so it‚Äôs got 0 % THC, to ensure that may be vital. If it‚Äôs completely unlawful for any THC content in your state, after that you may wish to seek a broad spectrum.
The 3rd group is completely detoxified: CBD oil. CBD oil reliable sources. They take all the terpenes from it. They take all of the THC from it as well as it‚Äôs just CBD. So in that item, you wouldn‚Äôt get this entourage impact, because it would simply be the CBD and also a lot of advocates of CBD oil out there truly ham up this entourage result and also claim, as well as you really don‚Äôt desire pure CBD oil. However a lot of this is anecdotal. A great deal of this is not actually studied in the scientific literature yet, but it will be, view quickly.
Here‚Äôs my listing of things you intend to search for when acquiring a CBD oil if you pick to do so:.
Primary, exactly how is the oil removed so there are much safer as well as much healthier methods. The very best one is called carbon dioxide extraction instead of solvent or ethanol removal. So search for a product that‚Äôs carbon dioxide removed.
Second, try to find a item that has set testing, so they have a lab analysis from a 3rd party resource that claims specifically what‚Äôs in the item as well as has a QR code, those little barcodes. You can scan with your iPhone to connect to that certificate of evaluation from the lab, which suggests, if you get pulled over as well as there‚Äôs this odd bottle of oil in your auto and the police officers like sir that‚Äôs some weed oil right there as well as you‚Äôre, like No, no, no rip-off. This QR code check out the lab evaluation. It really has no percent THC in it, and I can show it so you know specifically what you‚Äôre obtaining those set certificates now.
Below‚Äôs number 3, something you must try to find likewise is to reveal that it does not have heavy metals or chemicals contained in the item. All these things that you don‚Äôt wish to put in your body.
And finally, is it licensed by any type of federal government managed company? Is it USDA natural certified? Does it have good production methods qualification? These are some things that currently it drops under the USDA and not an illegal substance that even more and a lot more business are going to be getting licensed with these practices that are accepted by the USDA.
I went online and attempt to utilize all four of those concepts I simply gave you to discover a product that I could try or tell a person to try. I‚Äôm simply claiming: if somebody were going to attempt it these would be the items I would certainly look at currently.
I browse numerous sites. I browse all of the about us as well as regarding the companies and what they were certified in and what the sets appeared like and 2 of them I boiled it down to, if I were going to get a full spectrum oil that had a little bit of THC, I would possibly use this business called New Leaf. If I were going to make use of, a broad spectrum that really did not have any type of THC in it that had batch screening, no heavy metals was organic, etc, and so on. I think the top brand name I pick is a brand name called Joy Organics.
I would certainly obtain a no THC, 0 % otherwise understood as a broad-spectrum CBD oil If you‚Äôre stressed regarding it since it has absolutely no THC. I‚Äôm pretty sure will not make your medication display favorable, if you get a full spectrum that has tiny degrees of THC in it, I assume you‚Äôre rolling.

The five had allegedly robbed a spaza shop in Myeza Road, Masiphumelele, and made off with some cash, a cellphone and airtime, at 8.30pm.
Masiphumelele community leader, Dumsani Nhlapo, witnessed the robbery and told how he had had to duck and dive bullets.
Mr Nhlapo said he and a friend had called the police and had chased after the fleeing robbers who had fired three shots at them.
According to Ocean View police spokesman, Sergeant Leon Fortuin, officers responding to the robbery were shot at as they approached a red Toyota Corolla on the corner of Kommetjie Road and Capri Drive.
What followed was a high-speed chase along Kommetjie Road towards Fish Hoek, with the police officers and the armed robbery suspects trading gunfire.
During the chase, a 33-year-old constable was shot in the jaw and the shoulder.
Two police vehicles then trapped the suspects‚Äô car on the Fish Hoek sports fields.
Sergeant Fortuin said three of the suspects, aged 24 to 28, had been caught as they had made a run for it.
Two other suspects got away and are still at large.
Harrington Road resident Liz Samuels said she had heard four gunshots, although her husband had told her at the time that she had imagined them. Later she had read on the Facebook community group, Our Fish Hoek, about the shootout.
The injured constable was treated at the scene, then taken to hospital in a critical but stable condition. Police recovered a 9mm pistol as well as 9mm and .38 Special bullets.
The three suspects face charges of attempted murder and armed robbery. They appeared in the Simon‚Äôs Town Magistrate‚Äôs Court on Tuesday August 20. They were denied bail.
Fish Hoek Community Police Forum (CPF) chairman Andre Blom said the valley had seen an increase in violent crime.
The incident was a big ‚Äúwake-up call‚Äù, and he urged residents to join their neighbourhood watches.
Mr Nhlapo said there were business robberies in Masiphumelele almost daily but few were reported to the police.
There had been at least seven robberies in the past week, of which only one had been reported to the police, and that had been by him.
Sergeant Fortuin confirmed there had been two business robberies in Masiphumelele in one day last month.
On Tuesday July 23, the Wetlands spaza shop was robbed of R1000 and the owner‚Äôs cellphone was taken. Later that day, two men robbed a cigarette delivery vehicle of 31 cases of cigarettes to the value of R71 000.
No arrests have been made so far.
According to mayoral committee member for safety and security, JP Smith, there are no CCTV cameras in Fish Hoek, Masiphumelele and Simon‚Äôs Town, as the Metro police strategic surveillance unit can‚Äôt relay a signal to its control centres on the other side of Ou Kaapseweg.
However, Mr Smit said, there were plans to open a CCTV control centre in Ocean View so neighbourhood watches could monitor cameras there. Cameras could then be installed in Masiphumelele with the signals relayed to Ocean View.
But Mr Nhlapo is not convinced CCTV cameras are the solution.
Many of the shops that had been robbed had cameras and they hadn‚Äôt stopped the criminals, he said.

I keep two little flowers pots on my craft table, one for little flower leftovers and one for the bigger ones. You can adapt the size of your banner according to your flower sizes and make as many as you want, with 3 being the minimum. This one is made using a 4 inch long by 3.5 inch wide pennants. First cover chipboard with green paper for a "leafy" background that disappears once you start flowering on it.
This is all you need!
Start by anchoring all of the corners first then work your way around the edges and then inside
Use the "warping" of the flowers to your advantage like the green one on the right, it was a little flat on one side so I used it along the edge- don't worry about little bald spots that why we made the background green!
I usually punch holes to run my trim, but with the flowers this is tough, so just glue on your trim, making sure you hit each corner with the hot glue. I found this super cool leaf trim in my stash, it fit perfectly

These models are all $1,000-plus phones with a $1 million iPhone X in them.
The phones feature the same physical and software features as their higher-end siblings.
But there are some interesting things to note.
The iPhone X model comes with a ‚Äúdual-core‚Äù processor, and the iPhone 8 model comes without one.
Dual-core processors are faster and can be more efficient than single-core, but they tend to have a lower margin and are less reliable.
A $1 billion iPhone X has two cores.
The $300 model features a dual-core processor.
The $1-million iPhone X comes with four cores, and a $100,000 iPhone X costs $1.2 million.
But both of those models are more expensive than the $1 trillion iPhone X that launched earlier this year.
The big difference is the Apple Pay feature.
The iPhone X doesn‚Äôt have a built-in NFC chip, but you can buy a separate card for the iPhone and pay for things like iTunes and other services through Apple Pay.
Apple Pay uses a combination of Touch ID, facial recognition, and proximity sensors.
The NFC chip sits in the back of the phone, and you can‚Äôt use it if it‚Äôs in the foreground.
The fingerprint reader is built into the back.
The front-facing camera is located on the back, and it‚Äôs pretty good.
The Apple Pay features are limited to just a few merchants, like Apple stores, and they only work with cash, gift cards, and in-store purchases.
But you can still pay for most things using the Apple Watch, and Apple Pay works well even when you‚Äôre outside of Apple stores.
When it comes to the iPhone‚Äôs price, the $300 version comes with an unlocked dual-camera iPhone 8 and an unlocked iPhone X. The dual-cameras feature is similar to the $900-plus iPhone X models that Apple sells for $1m and $1 and $2.99, respectively.
The unlocked models feature two cameras on the front, and those cameras can record video at 1080p at 30fps and still be usable in daylight.
The two-camera models cost $1k.
The more expensive $1M model comes pre-loaded with an iPhone X Plus, a 5.8-inch screen, and 64GB of storage.
The phone supports Face ID, Touch ID for iPhone X users, and is powered by a Snapdragon 835 SoC.
The price tag for the $2,000 model is $1 more than the unlocked model, and $600 more than a $3,000 phone.
Both of these phones are available for pre-order on the iPhone Online store, but I‚Äôve not been able to get my hands on one yet.
The only way I could get one is if Apple makes it available.
I asked Apple if it had plans to offer a similar $1-$2,500 smartphone with a dual camera on the $3-3.99 iPhone X or $1 iPhone X+ with dual cameras.
It didn‚Äôt reply to my inquiry.
However, there‚Äôs a $2 iPhone X plus 2x $1 iPhones in the $5-5.99 range, so I guess that‚Äôs still possible.
You can read more about this in the full review I did with the $600 iPhone Xs and $750 iPhone XCs, but it‚Äôs worth noting that they‚Äôre actually cheaper than the phones listed in the list above.
The difference is that the phones are unlocked, so you can add accessories.
You‚Äôre also limited to a certain number of accessories per phone.
So what are the differences between these phones?
There‚Äôs a big difference between a $500 phone with dual camera and a dual phone with a 5-inch display, for example.
The differences are more subtle, and there‚Äôs also a price difference.
The price difference is worth noting, too.
The top-end iPhone X with dual rear cameras, the one pictured here, retails for $3k.
The bottom-end $2 phone has a dual rear camera, and both come in a $200 price range.
In other words, if you want to get the best phone with the most features, the cheapest one is going to be the best option.
The best phones with dual front cameras are more than $1K cheaper than other phones with two cameras.
This includes both the $500 and $500s, the ones with dual iPhone X cameras, and even the $10,000 phones.
There‚Äôs no way to go back and pick out the best iPhone X smartphone for your budget.
But if you‚Äôre looking for an iPhone 8 or X with a pair of dual rear-facing cameras, it‚Äôs probably worth considering.Chocolate tours in Costa Rica aren't just for the traveler with a sweet tooth. If you have an interest in traditional chocolate-producing techniques, the bean's hundreds of years of history and how it's grown and harvested, a chocolate tour in Costa Rica might be for you. Try one of these tours to get a first-hand look -- and taste -- at how a humble bean becomes a luscious desert.
Cacao Trails
Cacao Trails is park land that used to be a cacao plantation, and visitors can still see how the beans are grown and how chocolate is processed on the site. There is also an Indian Museum that details the history of those native to the area, including how they used the cacao bean. A river canoe ride shows off the splendor of the extensive gardens and native wildlife. The full two-hour guided chocolate tour features a history of the cacao bean and includes and hands-on instruction in the traditional methods of chocolate-making.
Tirimbina Chocolate Tour
The Tirimbina Biological Reserve in Sarapiqui, Costa Rica, is an ecotourism-focused park dedicated to teaching visitors about the country's flora, fauna and history. The cacao plot on the reserve no longer is used commercially; instead, guides use the plot to teach visitors about the traditional methods used to grow and process cacoa. The reserve offers two chocolate tours. The standard, two and a half hour tour features a hike across a suspension bridge and a walk through the cacao plot. You will see demonstrations of harvesting, fermentation, drying and processing cacao beans. The one and a half hour night tour takes place in the reserve's chocolate hut, where visitors learn about the development and processing of chocolate and may sample several different types of chocolate and a chocolate drink.
Chocorart
Four miles southeast of Playa Chiquita, Chocorart continues the tradition of chocolate making at the fully commercial plantation. A Swiss couple runs the plantation and organizes tours of four or more people, in your choice of French, English, German, Spanish or Italian. On the tour, you will see how cacao is planted, cultivated and processed on one of the last working cacoa plantations in Costa Rica. At the end of the tour, sample fresh chocolate made right on the plantation. Tours are by reservation only.
Bri Bri Indigenous Reserve
For hundreds of years, the Bri Bri tribe of southeastern Costa Rica has been making chocolate using traditional techniques for healing and purification purposes. The five to six hour tour takes you through much of the Bri Bri Reserve, beginning with a trek across a hanging bridge to visit the homes of tribe members and learn about their history. At the next stop, a shaman will explain medicinal purposes of different plants and herbs. A 30-minute waterfall hike is followed by lunch, after which visitors head to the cacao house to will learn about the chocolate making process and how chocolate has been used by the Bri Bri for more than 300 years. You can sample some organic chocolate products.

As Dr. Rashmi Bhatnagar explains, an abscessed tooth occurs when the nerve tissue surrounding the tooth has become necrotic, or died. This can happen for a number of reasons, including infection or trauma, and because of the death of nerve tissue, an individual may not recognize they have an abscessed tooth since they won‚Äôt experience the sensitivity they otherwise would with intact nerves.
‚ÄúWhen teeth die ‚Äì and people have dead teeth in their mouth all the time without realizing it ‚Äì they won‚Äôt feel the typical things that they otherwise would, things like heat, cold, or pressure,‚Äù says Bhatnagar. ‚ÄúIf you do feel pain in the mouth near a tooth, oftentimes this can be the early signs of an infection at the end of the root which is causing the pain.‚Äù
Any early signs of decay such as these should be inspected sooner rather than later as to avoid death of nerve tissue and ultimately an abscessed tooth. Gum disease can also be a contributing factor toward tissue decay, as bacteria underneath the tooth can create infection, damaging pulp and leading to the buildup of pus. Depending on the severity of an abscessed tooth, a dentist may choose various treatments, but most often abscessed teeth are treated with a root canal.
Though it may be difficult to tell whether you have an abscessed tooth or not due to lack of nerve tissue, the symptoms leading up to generally include pain and swelling, redness of gums, or a foul taste in the mouth around the affected.!

1. Do I need to hire a lawyer, and if so, when do I need one?
The answer to this question really depends on several factors. Factors like the personalities of you and your spouse and the significance of what is at stake in ending your marriage.
Making divorce decisions by yourself and without the help of an attorney sounds like an ideal situation, as it would save you time, money, and maybe, heartache. If you and your spouse are able to resolve these bigger issues together, then you would have to write an agreement that details the terms of your agreement and present it to the court for review and approval. Even when you and your spouse can get along and work out some issues together, there are often other complicated issues to decide, it is a good idea to hire a neutral third person, such as a mediator.
If there are bigger issues involved, which you and your spouse are unable to resolve alone, such as questions of children, money and property, at this point it is a good idea to turn over all the details and the burden of a divorce to a divorce lawyer.
In circumstances that you believe your spouse is being dishonest or vindictive, you should hire an attorney to protect your interests.
Lastly, if your spouse has an attorney, you should be hiring an attorney as well.
2. How much will a divorce cost me?
You will probably find that the cost of a divorce varies quite a bit as there are several factors to take into account. An important factor that is determinative in how much money you will spend, is whether your divorce is contested or uncontested. Meaning, the more you and your spouse can agree and cooperate on major issues, such as division of property, child custody, child support and so on, the less money you will need to spend on attorneys, legal fees, and court costs.
Once your divorce process has been set in motion, you are faced with attorney fees and court costs. Lawyers typically charge one of the two different types of billing arrangements, either a fixed fee or an hourly rate. The type of divorce you are pursuing can make a difference in which type of billing arrangement your attorney decides is appropriate.
A fixed fee rate means that you and your divorce attorney have agreed ahead of time on the total cost of legal work. Generally, attorneys will not choose this type of billing arrangement unless it appears that your divorce is straightforward with no major issues of disagreement between you and your ex-spouse.
If you are going through a contested divorce (meaning you and your spouse cannot agree on major issues such as dividing up the property, child custody and other things) it is likely that your lawyer will not chose a fixed fee rate because it is hard to predict how long your divorce proceeding could take. It is more likely that the attorney will have an hourly rate billing arrangement. In this arrangement, your attorney will charge an hourly rate (which differs among different attorneys, usually depending on their level of experience) for the time he or she has spent on your case.
3. Do I have to move out of my house while we are in the process of getting divorced?
You are not required to move out of your house while you are in the process of getting a divorce. There may be circumstances that the court will order one of the parties to vacate the family home, for instance, if there is abuse present.
If you can‚Äôt reason with your spouse and something significant is at stake, or the atmosphere in your home has become unhealthy for your children, then maybe moving out is an alternative you should think about. However, if you move out, it may be difficult for you to move back in at a later time if you change your mind.
4. How long could my divorce take? Do I have to go to court?
Again, this largely depends on the circumstances surrounding your divorce. Generally, your divorce will take as long as it takes for you and your spouse to agree on the terms of your divorce (a.k.a. ‚Äúseparation agreement‚Äù) or you have a trial before a judge.
In an uncontested divorce, there is complete agreement and cooperation between the parties regarding all issues, which is written in a divorce agreement. The agreement includes issues such as child custody, child support, parenting schedules, college education cost allocation, division of assets, division of debt, alimony, health-related insurances, etc. In this situation, you will complete documents that will be filed with the court and a court date will be assigned for an uncontested hearing. At this hearing, the judge will review and approve your agreement. These documents are usually completed by your divorce attorney, and include your joint petition for divorce (which is a court form), affidavits of irretrievable breakdown for each party, financial statements for each party, parenting course completion if minor children are involved, and a certified copy of your marriage certificate.
In a contested divorce, (when you and your spouse cannot reach an agreement on the major issues in your divorce agreement) you are much more likely to have to go to court; maybe many times, depending on the issues. Under these circumstances, your divorce process will be much longer. The timeline for a contested divorce can range up to almost 2 years if the parties are not able to reach an agreement. It takes about 2-6 weeks from the date of filing your complaint for divorce, to receive summons from the court to serve on the opposing party. Additionally, within in this time frame, the parties must exchange financial documents. From that point, it is really up to the parties to negotiate a workable agreement. If they are not able to, there will be a pre-trial conference to address the issues that have prevented reaching a settlement; this typically takes place within 6-10 months of you filing the complaint. If you are still unable to reach an agreement, your case may go to trial, which generally can be 14 to 16 months after filing the complaint.
5. What are the steps in the divorce process?
Typically, one of the parties files a complaint for divorce with the Probate and Family court in the county where you last lived together if one of you still lives in that county, or if neither of you live in that county, then the county where either you or your spouse lives. Thereafter, the court clerk will send you or your attorney the complaint summons which will have to be served to your spouse. Within 45 days of serving the complaint and summons, the parties are required to exchange three years of tax returns, bank and investment accounts, health insurance information, four recent paystubs, any financial applications either of you have made in the past three years. The most important document you must accurately complete is the Probate and Family Court Financial Statement form. Most of the financial decisions are based on that form, so it is very important to be accurate and fully disclose all of your income, expenses, assets and debt. The court will grant a divorce based on the information provided in that form.
Once these initial steps are completed and the case issues have been identified, a Pretrial Conference will be held. This is a hearing held by the judge who will review case and provide insight as to how the matter should resolve. Typically most cases settle after this hearing. Others may decide to go to trial so the judge can hear testimony of your case, review exhibits, and make a decision on all the contested issues, such as custody, support, and division of assets/debt.
This blog post is very abbreviated, and is intended to give a non-detailed overview. It is always better to consult with an attorney who can provide you with detailed advice unique to your specific situation.

Want a dividend-yielding portfolio? Glean lessons from gardening
For better yield, choose the best seeds and the right places to plant
Patience can be helpful with a dividend portfolio, but regular pruning is also needed
Long-term dividend investors and gardeners have a lot in common: they‚Äôre each seeking to reap a harvest from a carefully tended set of assets.
First off, just like gardeners, investors seeking dividend yield need to locate fertile land that can hopefully produce a bountiful crop. What‚Äôs the investment version of a sunny meadow with plenty of sun and access to water? Companies whose dividends have grown annually for the last several decades typically come from noncyclical sectors such as Consumer Staples, Utilities, and Health Care. Sectors that are more cyclical, such as information technology, may have a harder time producing consistent dividend growth because of their competitive and ever-changing nature. (That said, some tech companies have recently been paying higher dividends.)
Timing is another issue gardeners and dividend investors may need to keep in mind. Just as there are certain seasons more conducive to planting a garden, there can be better times to consider investing for dividend yield. Although trying to time the market can be a risky proposition and caution is always warranted, there may be "seasons" in the economic cycle when investors seeking a high-dividend yield have a better chance.
When the economy works through a rough patch, dividend yields often start to look more tempting. That‚Äôs because dividend-yielding stocks often, though not always, tend to perform better in a slower economic environment. Back in 2016, U.S. 10-year Treasury note yields fell to historic lows down near 1.4% as interest rates stayed near zero and growth around the world slowed. At that point, the average S&P 500 dividend yield of more than 2% began to look attractive to many investors, although they might have had to pay higher prices for the staples, utilities, and health care stocks with the highest dividends.
On the other hand, in mid-2018 when 10-year note yields climbed above 3%, dividend-yielding stocks might have appeared a little less attractive. Investors could buy a 10-year note and get a yield about 100 basis points higher than they‚Äôd get from the average S&P 500 stock. Plus, Treasury notes are generally considered a safer investment than stocks, although no investment is ever truly ‚Äúsafe.‚Äù
After picking the proper spot, deciding on the right time to plant, and tilling the fertile land, gardeners must select high-quality seeds. To give their dividend portfolio the best chance to grow, investors should try to think long term. Rather than selecting ‚Äúflavor of the day‚Äù individual stocks, consider choosing those with proven business success. This means doing some research to find out which companies have managed to regularly grow their business and pay dividends not just for years, but for decades. In other words, just as gardeners may want grade A blueberries, dividend investors may want grade A blue chips.
Once the high-quality seeds are planted, then comes the hard part: patiently awaiting growth. Patience is an essential trait for investors. Holding an asset for six months isn‚Äôt necessarily a long-term investment. Warren Buffett once said: ‚ÄúIf you aren‚Äôt willing to own a stock for 10 years, don‚Äôt even think about owning it for 10 minutes.‚Äù A 10-year holding period may not be right for every individual, but it illustrates that you‚Äôre buying a minority stake in an actual operating business that opens its doors every morning whether stock market sentiment is bullish or bearish. If you‚Äôve selected a successful business, that means it typically earns more money than it spends. And those profits are the direct source of dividend payments.
Once the investment starts to show signs of growth, maintenance is essential. For investors who may view their stock as the tree and the dividends as its fruit, it doesn‚Äôt make sense to cut down the tree to access the apples. Likewise, most long-term investors aren‚Äôt looking for excuses to sell their stock, because if they do, they won‚Äôt be able to enjoy the possible dividend growth that the stock could continue to provide in future years. A solid dividend stock can continue spinning off regular yield.
But that doesn‚Äôt mean you turn a blind eye to your investment and simply hope for the best. Any good gardener will tell you that clearing out the dead wood is critical for future growth. If an investment isn‚Äôt living up to your expectations and the original prospect of dividend growth has turned into a reality of dividend reduction, then that investment may not be fulfilling its purpose. It may need to be ‚Äúpruned‚Äù out of your portfolio.
In recent years, some historically high-dividend-yield stocks started to shrivel in the hot market sun. Some companies once considered benchmarks for regular payouts reduced their dividends or eliminated them altogether. Other companies faced bankruptcy or went out of business.
A plant that was healthy last summer might get eaten by a beetle next year, and stocks, too, go through periods of health and illness. That‚Äôs why it can be important to stay on top of maintenance and pruning, whether it‚Äôs in the garden in your backyard or the dividend stocks in your brokerage account.
Payment of stock dividends is not guaranteed and dividends may be discontinued. The underlying common stock is subject to market and business risks including insolven.

It took my partner and I three months of quizzing locals in our north-to-south tour of the States before hearing of the North Carolina hipster haven.
In hindsight, this was ironic, because the people of Asheville know how to spruik the best of their idyllic home.
Set against the scenic eastern fringe of the Great Smoky Mountains, a range famous for its vivid autumn foliage, Asheville is already a popular destination for adventurous Americans.
Outdoorsy types might know the North Carolina hub as a stop on the Appalachian Trail, the 3500-kilometre eastern cousin of the Pacific Crest Trail hiking route.
The city‚Äôs scenic surrounds house countless waterfalls, including the magnificent Looking Glass Falls, as well as walking and mountain-biking trails.
Indeed, the Smoky Mountains National Park is the US‚Äôs most visited national park.
The much-hyped Blue Ridge Parkway is a highway that bends through mountainous vistas before descending into the heart of Asheville.
We‚Äôve tried to list the best of the city on the encouraging advice of local business owners and patrons ‚Äì all quick to reel off eating, drinking or sightseeing activities.
Bursting with top-notch coffee shops, tattoo parlours and vintage wares, in many ways, the city seems more Portland than Portland. It even has more breweries.
A post-industrial town formerly on the ropes, it has a prolific art deco and warehouse architecture that have melded into its stylish rebirth as a culinary and cultural mecca in the South.
The Wicked Weed brewery and the Rankin Vault (named so because of the bank vault separating rooms) are lively dining spots.
Down by the French Broad River, the Smoky Park Supper Club serves up high-end contemporary American food in a restaurant built from shipping containers. In summer, patrons can watch river tubers drift by from the ample lawn space.
Wedge Brewing is more reminiscent of an East Berlin hangout. Nestled in the grungy River Arts District, it makes up part of a 1600-metre stretch of historical and industrial buildings repurposed into creative studios.
Phil Mechanic Studios is one shabby building in which tourists can witness resident visual artists working in their chosen mediums.
This large precinct dedicated to the arts is one of the things that sets Asheville apart as a boho bubble in the US South, attracting a mass migration of politically progressive urbanites to set up digs.
Asheville‚Äôs extroverted nature also propels its quirkier pastimes, like touring the Pinball Museum, where you can play 75 of these flashing neon relics for about A$19.
Nearby, the operators of the Battery Park Book Exchange and Champagne Bar have seen fit to combine two great indulgences in one luxurious setting.
Stay
Staying at the ritzy Grand Bohemian Hotel will make you feel as though you have come home to a hunting cabin with modern frills. The Tudor-inspired venue is next to the chateau-esque Biltmore Estate tourist attraction, about five kilometres from downtown Asheville.
The Cedar Crest Inn is a smaller-scale bed and breakfast with plush timber interiors. In town, the more affordable Sweet Pea Hostel offers travellers slick budget accommodation in a converted warehouse space.
Eat and drink
Early Girl Eatery doles out comfort food in a homely setting on Wall Street, a narrow but vibrant thoroughfare behind the main streets of Asheville. Go there for an easy introduction to hearty Southern staples.
Down the road, coffee shop Trade and Lore is where the hipsters hang. You can order drinks street-side through a small window at the Rankin Vault, on Rankin Avenue, and people-watch from footpath seats.
The cuisine at Smoky Park Supper Club will blow you away, as will the reasonable bill that arrives at the end. Before the sun goes down, head to the Montford Rooftop Bar for Asheville‚Äôs most charming vistas.
Do
Cruise the shopping area huddled around Lexington Avenue in downtown Asheville, and stretching along Haywood Road in West Asheville. Twice Round, on Haywood Road, has an on-point vintage clothing at great prices.
Hire an inner tube from Zen Tubing and float down the French Broad River during summer, or discover waterfalls in the nearby national and state parks. During autumn, take a scenic drive beneath blazing-red foliage in the Smoky Mountains.Vegetable Dyed Persian and Turkish Area Rugs. How Do They Do It?
, but it is the ivory wool that is easiest to alter through the process of dying to produce beautiful textiles and rugs.
The earliest traditional dyes were those made from various vegetable sources. Vegetables, plants, and yes even bugs were mixed with water in a liquid form to allow the wool to soak and transform to just about any color you can imagine.
Madder plants yield a range of colors from orange, reds, and purples. Saffron will produce yellows and Indigo will create shades of blue. Various other colors are made by mixing Saffron with Indigo or cobalt, and multiple shades of red or violet can be made with insect dye or lac which is derived from the shells of beetles.
Beautiful Persian, Turkish, Oriental and other textiles are a labor love. Unlike many machine manufactured ‚ÄúOriental‚Äù rugs that can be produced in a matter of hours, a hand-woven area rug, beginning from the dying process to the completion of the weaving, can take many months or years to create a single rug.

A brisk wind didn‚Äôt help matters at all and my only morning excursion was a walk to the corner shop holding onto my umbrella firmly.
Evie played indoors.
I didn‚Äôt get a camera out until after lunch when I peered through the gloom at some rather gloomy birds‚Ä¶
‚Ä¶and a goldfinch who had bitten off more than he could chew.
There wasn‚Äôt a lot of traffic but a couple of siskins had to wait for their turn.
When it was time for Evie to have her nap after lunch, I went for a walk. The forecast had suggested that without the day getting noticeably brighter, at least the rain might ease off. This turned out to be the case, so I set out to walk up onto Meikleholm Hill.
I was looking for any sign of brightness to cheer the day up. The trackside garden at the top of Holmwood is still looking good‚Ä¶
‚Ä¶and some sheep had been painted yellow.
It was not a day for views, as I found when I got to the open hill‚Ä¶
‚Ä¶but because there were no sheep about, it was a day for wild flowers as I walked round the shoulder of the hill.
‚Ä¶and one solitary fungus!
There was scabious everywhere and my path was lined with blue.
I was following an angled path and as it took me gently higher up the hill, I found myself actually in the low cloud which had been hanging over the town all day. This was a soggy experience and it didn‚Äôt take me long to decide to leave the misty heights‚Ä¶
‚Ä¶and get back to a slightly drier level.
I followed the track from the water tank down to the Bentpath road, leaving the open hill at this little burn‚Ä¶
‚Ä¶and dodging the low hanging branches beside the track through the trees.
The mist had descended with me and it wasn‚Äôt any brighter now than it had been on the hill but there were things to see‚Ä¶
‚Ä¶and although it seemed to get gloomier the lower down the hill that I went..
‚Ä¶there were patches of brightness, including a very unexpected crocosmia in the woods.
When I got to the road, I followed it back to Langholm‚Ä¶
‚Ä¶and although it didn‚Äôt get any brighter, I was at least sheltered from the wind, and warm and dry enough to unzip my coat.
There was another starling on the power lines above the garden when I got home, but unlike the one yesterday, it was not taking in any rays and it had to hang on firmly in the breeze.
I didn‚Äôt have much enthusiasm for flower pictures, even though it had stopped raining, as everything was dark and damp‚Ä¶
‚Ä¶so I went in and joined the others for a cup of tea.
It seemed like a good day for cooking so I had a go at making a Selkirk Bannock. This is a very fruity leavened bread. It took some time as the dough has to be left to rise, then knocked back and then left to rise again. It was a learning experience because getting a tremendous amount of sultanas kneaded into the mixture was no easy task. However, with the encouragement of Annie, I persevered and the end result was not as bad as I feared that it might be‚Ä¶
‚Ä¶and since it passed the taste test, I will have another go (when I have replenished our stock of sultanas), probably making two smaller bannocks rather than one big one.
While the dough was rising, I found a siskin doing some professional posing. You might think that I have flipped a picture in the editor to make the panel, but it is the same siskin photographed a few seconds apart.
I also saw a coal tit, but I could only just make it out as the day got darker and darker.
We are promised a little sunshine tomorrow morning. I hope we get it and then things can dry up a bit and Evie can have a better outing than her short trip to the garden today.
The flying bird of the day is having an argument.
24 thoughts on ‚ÄúHead in the clouds‚Äù
Your Selkirk Bannock is a new one on me,and I was a chef many years ago..must admit it does look scrumptious.üëç
Like your three trees in the eerie mist,which I don‚Äôt mind as it gives a different perspective on nature,but not to often though.
Our weather this year has had plenty of variety to say the least,certainly not boring üòä
I wouldn‚Äôt mind being bored by some continuous sunshine.
The roadside flower garden is very beautiful.
I love walking on days like you had but trying to take photos in it isn‚Äôt any fun.
The overlook of the town looks very gloomy indeed, but it probably wasn‚Äôt so bad if you were down there.
No, it was very gloomy in the town all day. Not like a late summer day at all.
I know it‚Äôs easy to say when it‚Äôs not me shrouded in mist, but it is quite lovely in your photos. If it makes you feel any better, it was 3¬∫C when I got up this morning.
The volume of raisins you managed to work into that dough is quite impressive!
There was nearly as much fruit as flour by weight in the recipe. üôÇ
Hope you get some nice days soon. So much rain! At least everything is nice and green.
We have had no problem in staying green this summer after a dry spell in spring.
Love the haws and the trackside garden. Oh how I‚Äôd love a misty day because it is in the 80s.
Miserable and gloomy it might have been, but your misty shots are beautiful to see and your baking looks mouth-watering!
The baking tasted good so it was not a bead effort for a first try.
Loved all the wildflowers you saw as you walked and the arguing birds as the flying bird of the day.
You did very well with your photographs in the misty dampness.
The Bannock is a triumph.
The Bannock looks delicious, Tom. And you managed to get some lovely shots of the countryside despite the misty weather. We finally got some of that rain so hopefully things will look a little more refreshed now.
You were saying how parched things were round you so you will welcome rain a bit more than me at the moment. üôÇ
You did well with the camera in the circumstances. I like the reflective siskin
It is not often that birds sit in that particular place.
Really lovely atmospheric photos ‚Ä¶good look at but maybe not to walk through! The Selkirk Bannock looks delicious.
I enjoyed the walk. On the hill in the wind and clouds, it felt quite Byronic and in the valley, it was really quiet and peaceful.
Homemade raisin bread! Did you add cinnamon to the mix? I grew up eating a lot of this kind of bread as my mother loved it.
Your rainy day photos are quite cheery, and I envy your atmospheric conditions right now. üôÇ The birds, especially the mirror image siskins, are a treat. You are good at catching them in your lens.
There is a Level 3 fire evacuation to the north of us now, with strong winds driving smoke this direction. Our county is now on alert. High winds can take embers along with them, spreading the fires. We lost power last night due to high winds. The heavy smoke made this area look Mordor.
The bannock was spice free. It is intentionally a very simple recipe.
I am sorry to hear that the fires are beginning to affect you. I don‚Äôt like the sound of your Mordor comparison at all.
Lines at gas stations are long. There is now a Level 2 evacuation order to the south of us up to our county border, meaning ‚Äúbe set‚Äù. Oregon uses a three level evacuation sequence. Level 1: ‚ÄúBe ready‚Äù, Level 2 : ‚ÄúBe set, Level 3: ‚ÄúLeave now‚Äù. Our town and county is at Level 1 at this time, but the fire from the south looks like it is creeping up faster.
Level 1 sounds bad enough so I hope that you don‚Äôt get to level 2.
LOvely atmospheric (or wet) shots. I admit, I looked at the siskin and wondered why you had turned the image round. üôÇindex Posted on March 8, 2019March 21, 2019 by admin 0 Student Work Leave a Reply Cancel replyYour email address will not be published.

- Larry F. Hodges, Rob Kooper
, Thomas C. Meyer, Barbara O. Rothbaum, Dan Opdyke, Johannes J. de Graaff, James S. Williford, Max M. North:

With 6 engaging fascinating series, learning a new language has never been this fun! The KABIMBA Series uses a natural immersion style of child learning, immersing your child with the right visual and sound that is modelled on our key learning approach.
The unique KABIMBA leaching design is very effective for visual, verbal, musical learners. The more ways in which your child is engaged with the KABIMBA stories, the more quickly and naturally your child absorbs the new language.
Available now in the App Store and Google Play.
‚ÄúMy sons love this program and they are mastering several words and phrases already! It is so nice to see that they don‚Äôt even realize the words are part of a foreign language any more as it comes so natural to them. I love it, and can only imagine this will give them an edge when talking with relatives! In addition, the videos are very engaging and my children ask to watch them nearly every time we are in the car ‚Äì It‚Äôs a clear winner for us!‚Äù
Eniola, United Kingdom
‚ÄúMy children where born in the United States and they hardly understand their native tongue and this has been a bit of a worry for us. After discovering Kabimba, we are now very happy, our kids now understanding the Igbo language including how to greet so fast! I would recommend Kabimba over and over again. The apps are also great for adults as well, they help my husband and I remember forgotten words while learning new ones. Kabimba is very effective and entertaining for all ages (my self and my husband included).‚Äù
Ada, United States
‚ÄúOnly after watching a few videos, my kids were able to remember Hausa words and complete sentences. They are always excited to watch the next video in the series and also asking to go on the quiz app.‚Äù
Fatima, United Kingdom
‚ÄúBoth my older and younger children are fascinated with this Kabimba. The immersion style of the Yoruba videos and quiz app ensures the words really stick. It‚Äôs great to have a native speaker on the videos so my kids and I can get the pronunciation correct. I can‚Äôt wait to see how our children progresses, I think they will definitely have an easier time learning to be fluent in a second language.‚Äù
Bunmi, United Kingdom
‚ÄúMy kids ages 8, 10 and 11 love it. They repeat the words very regularly and have started greeting in Igbo. The videos are great and the corresponding quiz packs are fantastic for re-enforcements of key words and sentences. The videos and quiz combination actually really help the whole family understand Igbo much better. I would definitely recommend Kabima to others.‚Äù

Prepare for soaring mountains under a sparkling blue sky when camping at Mount Magazine State Park in Paris, Arkansas. Located in the rich northwestern region of Arkansas, you‚Äôll find the scenic Subiaco, a mere 25-minute drive from the park, and the exciting city of Booneville, a little over 40 minutes away. Boasting the highest altitudes in all of Arkansas, the park offers breathtaking views of the valley, vast azure lakes, neighboring peaks, and so much more.
Legendary for the medicinal properties of its cool, clear waters and fresh mountain air, Mount Magazine State Park was once home to a host of early Arkansas settlers. Farmers filled the mountains with luscious crops and miles of pastures until the Great Depression shattered the nation and forced farmers to abandon their homes. However, the area was destined for the world to enjoy and was declared an official state park in 1998. Today, Paris campers can delight in magnificent views, luxurious RV camping, fun hang-gliding, scenic hiking, daring rock climbing, and more!
The park features just over 14 miles purely devoted to hiking. Journey up to the tip of Signal Hill, where the 2,753-foot elevation marks the highest point in all of Arkansas, or backpack some of the park‚Äôs longer trails which connect to the Ozark National Forest. One of the benefits of hiking the one-and-a-half-mile trail is the massive highpoint monument: a 400-foot stone map of the six natural divisions of Arkansas.
Looking to enjoy the views in a more relaxed setting on your Mount Magazine State Park camping adventure? Walk along the two-mile-long Benefield Loop Trail, where you might catch glimpses of unique flora and fauna. Have fun searching for species such as the Wood‚Äôs False Hellebore, a green plant that looks like it's been crafted from sugared marzipan, or the western wallflower, a burst of orange flowers that blooms in rocky soil while strolling this trail.
If you're a thrillseeker, then slide on over to the Mount Magazine State Park Visitor Center to register for some white-knuckled rock climbing at Mount Magazine. Not only does the mountain hold the highest elevation in Arkansas, but it also creates the perfect atmosphere for rock climbers to try their hand at some hardcore climbing. From technical and sport climbing to rappelling and traditional Arkansas bouldering, this mountain has it all.
If you‚Äôre in love with the mountain views, but find that rock climbing isn‚Äôt your thing, then take a chance hang gliding at Mount Magazine. A spectacular sport that provides fun for the viewer and the doer alike, hang gliders can register right at the park's visitors' center for a thrilling experience. Soaring high above the mountain range, woodland colors bursting to life below you, you‚Äôll create a memory that will last a lifetime.
Although the visitors' center is used to register for these extreme sports, it's also put to use in cultivating the perfect environment for showcasing Mount Magazine State Park. Filled with 8,000 feet of boundless history, a fragrant garden, audiovisual programs, and so much more, the visitors' center is a haven of learning for locals and travelers alike.
Park that RV rental over at Mount Magazine State Park Campground, where 18 campsites await you in a cozily forested environment. Situated near the ledge of a huge drop-off, the former Cameron Bluff Campground showcases brilliant views all from the comfort of your campsite. Pets are welcome here, and you‚Äôll definitely want to bring them along to walk some of the convenient nature trails around the campground.
Bundle up nice and warm with a hot cup of coffee fresh from your coffee pot, as each site offers water and electric hookups. Sewer hookups are also available, along with an RV dump station, hot showers, and flush toilets. Mount Magazine State Park campers will enjoy convenient amenities to create the luxurious vacation that their hearts desire.
Although Paris, Arkansas is not quite the same as Paris, France, the west side of town still boasts its very own Eiffel Tower. Bring the family on over to Eiffel Tower Park, where you can snap your very own memorable family photo alongside the 25-foot-tall tower that doubles as a spectacular water fountain. Or head over to the Paris-Logan County Coal Miners Memorial for an educational dive into the town‚Äôs history in coal mining. View hundreds of colorful artifacts, photographs, and monuments all commemorating local coal miners.
Also in town is the Cove Lake Recreation Area, a beautiful spot nestled upon a 160-acre mountain lake. This cozy spot offers swimming, canoe and boat rentals, fishing, and hiking all for state park RV campers to enjoy. Escape from the hot summer sun under shaded trees while the kids splash about in the lake, or jump right on in with them for an afternoon treat. A mere ten-minute drive away from your campsite, Cove Lake creates an ideal destination when paired with Mount Magazine State Park.
Running low on gas and groceries? Breathe easy in downtown Paris, as numerous grocery stores and gas stations cater to your needs. If you're in search of some nourishment, stay in town for a variety of dining options. Fine dining, bistro, barbecue, grill, bakeries, Mexican, and fast food all await you right in town. Or head back to Mount Magazine State Park for a fine dining experience at the park's own restaurant that will dazzle and delight the senses. Overlooking a panorama of beauty through floor to ceiling windows, travelers can enjoy flavorful Arkansas food while relaxing in the rustic atmosphere.

On April 1st, 2008 Shane Brewer, the founder and owner of Out of This Galaxy Bakery was diagnosed with Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia. During his treatment he benefited from two charitable organizations: Make-A-Wish Foundation and Friends of Kids with Cancer. During the end of treatments Shane went off to college and received degrees in Culinary Science and Hospitality Management. He later went to Culinary School and recieved a Baking and Pastry degree. While in college he would spend long days in classes and wanted to find alternatives for snacks to the mass produced grocery store offerings. After a while he came up with making granola bites because it was nutritious, easy to carry, and filling. With a degree in Culinary Science, he had all the knowledge of ingredient interactions to make them the way he wanted. He wanted to be unique and produce a bite that tasted homemade and fresh just like what would come out of your own kitchen. With that in mind, he went to work creating a bite that was made from all natural ingredients that you could find in your local grocery store. With no preservatives added we have a commitment to making them fresh so you are guaranteed to have a fresh, high quality bite each time you order. In the end this means more work for us, but a better quality product for you. With each purchase we donate 10% of our proceeds between the two charities. Please see below to learn more about these charities. Know that when you purchase granola bites from our company they are not only fresh, but you are helping to support a great cause. Thank you for your support and please contact us with any questions and we will get back to you as soon as possible.

ORLANDO, Fla ‚Äì The Orange County Convention Center is counting down the hours until it opens the Orlando Winterfest and Holiday Market.
The event begins Thursday and will be the first holiday gift show of the year after previously scheduled events were canceled or postponed into 2021 due to the coronavirus pandemic.
[TRENDING: Safe to shop during pandemic? | Photos show miracle rescue at sea | Video: Massive gator devours duck]
The event will feature 125 vendors, including some local to the Orlando area, live music and entertainment, family activities, a snow zone and festive food and drinks. In a news release, event leaders said the holiday market will provide the time and space for companies that haven‚Äôt had a way to network with their customers face-to-face to help them make the sales they desperately need this year.

The event will kick off Thursday, with the community tree lighting at 4 p.m.
‚ÄúWe have all faced a year like no other. Our International Drive businesses have pushed through with strength and hope as I have never seen before. We are thrilled to have something new and exciting for us all to look forward to this holiday season,‚Äù said Luann Brooks, executive director at the I-Drive Business Improvement District.
Tickets for the event are being sold exclusively through Ticketmaster. General adult admission for one day is $13 in advance or $16 at the door. Child tickets for one day are $6 in advance or $9 at the door. The event is also selling multiple-day passes.

Orange County Convention Center officials say they‚Äôre committed to putting safety ahead of everything and have implemented a number of COVID-19 safety and health guidelines.
‚ÄúAfter safely hosting several events, consumer shows and implementing our recovery and resiliency, we are confident that Winterfest will provide an enjoyable holiday experience for all to enjoy at the OCCC,‚Äù said OCCC Executive Director Mark Tester.

One of the strengths of the AGPM tool is how it has extended the delegation of group policy objects. One of these features is the more granular control over delegation. The AGPM has its own delegation model which allows for more specific settings giving greater leverage over delegation assignments. AGPM also allows for a new feature in the offline editing of GPO‚Äôs. This means that group policy administrators will now have to check-in and check-out GPO‚Äôs for editing. This not only provides better security but also prevents multiple people from editing the same live GPO at the same time.

Malicious actors are using this as a opportunity to set up traps for teachers. Ransomware actors send fake assignments to teachers who work remotely, hoping to infect them with malware. The actors are using documents that fetch the malware from a legitimate code-hosting platform. The ransom is not high, which indicates a low-level actor, yet it still serves as an example of what to watch out for.
The ongoing campaign was noticed by Proofpoint researchers, who are warning about it while at an early phase.
The actors are sending emails using subjects like ‚ÄúSon‚Äôs Assignment Upload‚Äù or ‚ÄúAssignment Upload Failure for [Name of Student],‚Äù posing as the parent of a student who supposedly couldn‚Äôt upload the assignment on the school‚Äôs remote teaching platform. The idea is to trick the teacher into accepting the submission over email, while the addresses are likely sourced from public records. The attachments are either a ZIP or a DOC file, and they are laced with macros that fetch malware from ‚Äònotabug.org.‚Äô
If the victim ‚Äúenables content‚Äù on their MS Office Suite, and once the code hosting service successfully fetches the executables, the attacker receives a notification SMS so that he/she may take over the extortion process. The victim also gets a warning dialog where the actors identify themselves as ‚Äúemployer21.‚Äù
Unfortunately, some school districts still haven‚Äôt elevated their concern for ransomware attacks. Ransomware attacks have increased in volume and speed, and their impact has become much more significant as many schools continue online instruction. Teachers who work from home should keep this example in mind, and be very careful when they receive documents that ask them to ‚Äúenable content.‚Äù In almost all of the cases, this is an attempt to infect them with malware.
Cybercrime is at an all-time high, and hackers are setting their sights on those considered ‚Äúlow hanging fruit.‚Äù Don‚Äôt be their next victim! You can have all of that brilliant stuff on the back end, but if somebody leaves the front door wide open, it‚Äôs not much. No matter how ‚Äúbomb-proof‚Äù the network, you can still invite a hacker in. There are layers to security.

May 27, 2015
>>IMAGE your next move less stressful.
Pack an overnight bag
Skip the stress of trying to find the essentials at your new home or apartment by packing an overnight bag. You should include toothbrushes, haircare products, makeup and clothing, enough to keep you dressed for a couple days.
Label your boxes
Rather than stare at a pyramid of boxes in the living room of your new digs, label each box so that it is delivered to the appropriate room. Sure, you'll have boxes all over the place but at least they'll be in the right room.
Take a picture
You may need to take several actually. Snapping a picture of how your electronics are assembled BEFORE you take them apart will make it much easier to put them back together.
Pack your closet
The easiest way to pack a closet is to leave items hanging and put a large trash bag over the bottom of them and tie it at the top. You should be able to remove the bag and place them in your new closet. Simple!
Use plastic wrap
Shampoos, dish soaps and other liquids have a tendency to leak. Prevent that and the mess you'd have to clean up by wrapping the opening and entire bottle with plastic wrap before packing.
Keep little pieces together
If you have to take items like furniture apart make sure you keep all little pieces together in a sealed bag and label the bag for each item it belongs to.
Hire a sitter
Moving can be confusing without the added pressure of little people and four-legged friends under your feet. Hiring a sitter will remove the stress of worrying about your kids and pets and let you focus on the big move.
So there you go, a few ideas. We also have an even better one - contact Long Island Moving And Storage! Family owned and operated, our Long Island moving company specializes in short hauls and long distance moves. Serving Atlantic Beach, Bayville, and communities across Long Island, we are ready to help you move around the corner or move to Florida!![Dustin Wakefield (Family photo via gofundme.com)

Gabriella Sanders, the soon-to-be ex-wife of the Broncos receiver, claims Sanders lied to Broncos brass about heading to Houston for the birth of their second child in order to miss a practice.
‚ÄúIt was a lie so he could go out partying,‚Äù she claims in court documents obtained by TMZ.
Gabriella also alleges Sanders spent thousands of dollars on the other women in his life.
‚ÄúWhen he‚Äôs not playing football on the field, he ‚Äòplays the field‚Äô with numerous women [with] whom he is or has committed adultery,‚Äù she says, adding Sanders shelled out ‚Äúthousands upon thousands of dollars on girlfriends and wasting the community estate, even purchasing a vehicle for one of his illicit affairs.‚Äù
While Gabriella originally filed for divorce in October after nearly three years of marriage, it appeared the couple had reconciled in December following the birth of their daughter, Zoie. Taking to Instagram, Sanders shared a family shot with the caption, ‚ÄúChristmas came early for us this year #blessed.‚Äù
A judge originally granted a temporary restraining order to Gabriella, giving Sanders ‚Äúlimited‚Äù access to their children. Gabriella also requested an undisclosed amount for child support.
Sanders signed a $33 million contract extension with the Broncos in September.In early July of 2020, Mulesoft released it‚Äôs Mule Migration Assistant (MMA) which automates some aspects of migration from Mule 3.x to 4.x. Promised well over a year ago, better late than never. The documentation can be found at
I took the time to try out the migration process on a very simple project and see what lessons might be learned. This article can be viewed as a description of what I did and a review of the tools.
The MMA application can be downloaded in compiled form from
It‚Äôs available as a tarball and a zip. After decompressing it, you are left with an executable JAR called mule-migration-assistant-runner-1.1.0.jar, plus a collection of support libraries.
I created a trivial Mule project using Studio 6 called ‚Äúmma-hello‚Äù using the 3.9.2 runtime. A simple project demonstrates basic operation of the migration tool without complicating the results. The mma-hello application logs a hello message and sets the response to hello world.
The code looks like this:
And the XML source:
That‚Äôs about as simple as it gets.
To run the assistant, CD into your installed MMA directory. Then:
java -jar mule-migration-assistant-runner-*1.1.0.jar [parameters]
Where documented parameters consist of:
For me, this works out to:
java -jar mule-migration-assistant-runner-1.1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar \
-projectBasePath C:/Users/markj/AnypointStudio/personal-workspace/mma-hello \
-destinationProjectBasePath C:/Users/markj/AnypointStudio/personal-workspace/mma-hello-v4 \
-muleVersion 4.3.0
Note that this command is not fully described on docs.mulesoft.com, nor is it in the README file on GitHub. Rather, you need to drill down a bit into the /docs of the cloned sources, but you can also use the -help parameter to provide more help information:
Typically, the documentation is out of date regarding the actual application. Note the addition of several proxy parameters that allow projects to be migrated in a secured environment.
Running the command above, I get:

To have a look at the results, I imported it into Studio 7.4. The resulting code looks like this:
There are several references to inbound and outbound properties here. I think these are standard warnings regarding such properties, though none are set or used in the mma-hello example. Still, this clutters up the XML code.
Also notice the use of the DW function, migration::HttpListener::httpListenerResponseHeaders(vars). This looks like it‚Äôs pushing vars into headers, but the original code doesn‚Äôt do that. Perhaps this reflects the default behavior of the 3.9.2 HTTP connector. In order for that information to continue to be present in the migrated application, it needs to be pushed into headers.
Finally, the original code in my 3.9.2 code comes across without any problem.
While these additional warnings are useful the first few times the migration assistant is used, it just adds clutter to the code. This would be annoying if you needed to migrate 100 APIs and needlessly increases file sizes.
There are some things that the MMA won‚Äôt handle. For example, it‚Äôs not all that surprising that Java classes don‚Äôt migrate since custom Java classes used in a Mule project would have a lot of references to the older object model. Mapping the old model to the new one would be quite difficult. Also unsupported are:
- DataMapper (manual migration to DataWeave is recommended)
- Custom types defined in Studio
- The <expression-component> element
- Any unlisted connectors or modules.
I had problems when I tried to include a Mule domain, but didn‚Äôt take the time to figure it out. Caveat emptor!
Overall, the Mule Migration Assistant can do a lot of the heavy lifting involved in migration. The documentation suggests that you ‚Äúprepare the code‚Äù for migration, like converting MEL expressions into Dataweave, but that kinda misses the point of a migration tool. If you used DataMapper in your old projects, you are going to have to migrate them by hand to Mule 4 ‚Äì no getting around that. MMA will migrate standard connectors, but not third party or custom ones. The report generated is helpful in pinning down where the problems are. Warnings are too verbose, in my opinion, and there should be an option to reduce/eliminate them. Warning comments will seriously clutter up converted XML.
Bear in mind that this review covers a VERY simple example. More complex applications will be more difficult to migrate. The support provided by the MMA only covers the mechanical parts of the conversion, which is a small part of a large application or set of interlocking APIs. This is where assistance from experts like those provided by MS3 can help to make your migration process smooth, timely, reliable, and within budget.

More importantly, having an online presence is not enough; your website needs to perform well in the search engine.
Since the digital marketing field is becoming more and more competitive, small businesses prefer to hire a reputed SEO agency for their improving Google ranking. Igloo, a reputed SEO agency in Dubai, suggests some insightful strategies to improve search engine performance and boost ranking in Google. Continue reading to know about those strategies and best practices.
If you want to rank higher in Google, follow these best practices and tactics to improve your search engine performance and high authority.
First and foremost, it‚Äôs crucial to know where do you stand in your niche and what are your website‚Äôs performance indexes. You can check out your website authority using different SEO tools. It will help you determine what SEO strategy will work for you.
Moreover, it will also help you to select keywords for your website. If you don‚Äôt have high domain authority, you can target low difficulty, high volume keywords to your website. So, the first thing is to check your website‚Äôs position in the search engine is the first step before applying any SEO strategy.
Based on your position, you need to do smart keyword research. Although difficult keywords have high volume, they are not ideal keyword selection because it‚Äôs hard to compete with a low domain score.
There are several free and paid SEO tools using which you can find relevant keywords in your niche. Choose long-tail keywords for targeting a specific audience. Look for Google‚Äôs recommendation from the autocomplete feature. It will give some idea of keyword selection.
Once you find 5 to 10 keywords, you need to identify the user‚Äôs intent. Understanding the user‚Äôs intent will help you create relevant content that they are looking for. The best way to figure out user intent is to search the keyword in Google.
After you hit enter, you will find a lot of search results. Now, you can analyze them to understand what people want to know for this particular keyword. You can use ‚ÄúPeople also ask‚Äù in Google‚Äôs SERP to figure out the search intent of users. There are mainly three types of user intent: informational intent, transaction intent, and navigational intent.
Based on the keyword and user intent, you need to create high-quality useful SEO-friendly content. Poor and irrelevant content can increase your bounce rate, and users may not stay longer on your site.
SEO-friendly means you need to maintain proper keyword density and the general guidelines of SEO for a better search engine performance. Try to use the focus keyword in your title tags, meta descriptions, heading tags, introduction, conclusion naturally.
Internal linking helps Google to recognize that your website has enough information for the user. It helps you to build a site structure. Another benefit of internal linking is visitors spend more time on your site.
External linking is a good way to improve your site rank and also authority. When you get links from high-authority sites, it indicates to Google that your site is a trusted one and authority in your niche.
Finally, you need to track your pages and figure out which pages are ranking on Google. Based on your performance, you can optimize those pages through content optimization, link building, etc.
Make your content more relevant and appealing by adding frequently asked questions on the topic and proper format. When you add these questions and properly format your content, chances are higher that Google can show them in featured snippets.
These are some simple ways that you can apply to your website for better ranking organically. There are other paid strategies to boost your ranking, such as social media marketing, Google Ads, Influencer marketing, etc. However, it‚Äôs better to work on organic traffic initially before applying any paid campaigns.

From news, emails to social media it‚Äôs hard to get away from the barrage of info. For some, it‚Äôs even more personal as they feel the effects of the Coronavirus (COVID-19) first hand. Our thoughts are with those impacted.
In times like the current, when social distancing has become the norm, how do you get away from the chaos that comes through multiple channels? Some choose to go for a walk, some run, and some workout out at home by whatever means necessary. For many of us mountain bikers, we find solitude being out in the woods on our bikes. In reality, that has always been our happy place where we can hit the trail and brush off the stress of the day.
A late friend of mine had the mantra of ‚ÄúAlways Ride‚Äù. I‚Äôm a firm believer of that and will continue to try and find ways to pedal during these times. Even if it means the Wahoo bike trainer or track stands in the driveway by myself to keep up with Social Distancing guidelines of the health department. I‚Äôve also decided to take less risk with my bike riding right now. I want to minimize the chance for injury and a possible visit to what is an already overwhelmed Emergency room, and Healthcare system. We suggest everyone take this into consideration and do the same. There will always be time later to go faster, bigger and ride the lines you‚Äôve never ridden before. Keep the riding solo. There will always be group rides and post ride beers again.
Stay safe everyone and enjoy some peaceful solitude stoke from the crew over at Transition Bikes.- Lapis and Gold Espresso Cup + Saucer

Wait, I might have just skipped ahead.
As a writer seeking to be published some day, you want to know at which point in your journey you intend to worry about publishing. Many of us prefer the traditional way of a book contract with a suitable publishing house, and some are elated to self publish it. That said, for both, what you absolutely need to be sure of is the genre of the book. That is where the second draft comes in.
1. Decide the genre of the book
Personally I feel that you should start seeking book contracts and literary agents after you‚Äôve decided on the genre of the book and done with a substantial portion of the writing. It may happen that you start thinking romantic comedy as you start writing, and what you end up writing is horror. It has happened with me, so really, it‚Äôs all quite possible.
2. Establish credibility beyond the obvious
The next step when you start reaching out to agents and agencies- I‚Äôd say have an established online presence by then. It helps to have a blog or a website where you self publish and you have some followers. Basically people will stay intrigued by you if they know that you can write for an audience. This blog that you are reading this on, is my attempt to establish that I am good at my craft (albeit some proofreading and editing challenges), and helps me hone my writing further.
A sub step to this would be to get yourself some guest writing assignments elsewhere. That‚Äôs another way to ensure that some part of your content is being published by others too. It adds tremendously to your repertoire.
3. Find a literary agent or a publishing agency
This is when you have to be honest about the potential of your work. If you want to be published by the big names (Harper Collins, Sceptre Books, Hachette India, Hutchinson London and so on) you will most likely need an agent. You will also need one if you are doing literary fiction or big books that you believe have the potential to change the world.
The other books, the smaller stories, the bits of non- fiction are that much harder to find an agent or a publisher for. These probably you should self publish. Non fiction doesn‚Äôt get signed on until the publisher is sure that it will sell in excess of 10,000 copies.
Finding the literary agent who‚Äôs the right fit for you is like finding a needle in a haystack.
Jane Friedman has excellent recommendations when it comes to this. This link here tells you a lot about getting published and of being a part of the right market places when it comes to agents..
I am based out of India and have also researched the Indian landscape. Sameer Kamat, a published author has a lot to say on this.
It doesn‚Äôt matter though, the geography. Literary agents don‚Äôt have quotas for native writers and it‚Äôs all about whose attention you grab first. But finding an agent and getting published traditionally is probably the rung that will test how much faith you have in your work.
4. Keep your materials handy
If it‚Äôs fiction, it is best to have the first 2-3 chapters ready. When they ask for a sample, send the first chapter. It doesn‚Äôt make sense to send something from in between, no matter how well you think you‚Äôve written it.
For non fiction, you can take your pick.
Most agencies will have a form that they expect to be meticulously filled out. Don‚Äôt cut corners there. It is the first representation of the idea that your book is. It demands as much focus as the book itself, if not more. Always keep handy a well written synopsis of the book. Keep it short, nothing more than 500 words and ensure that it captures beautifully the essence of the book. Often that‚Äôs the only document that is requested apart from a query letter.
Be sure to find out more about your agent too. What kind of books have they published before? Which authors do they have on their roster?
5. What after submission?
The right literary agent is both your mentor and guide. They will be able to tell you what worked out and what didn‚Äôt. The best agents serve as great sounding boards and are able to enrich your work with industry insights and their practical experience. Rejection is a part of the process. If anything, it means that your work was read by somebody and that there‚Äôs still scope for it to be turned into a master piece.
Publishing a book makes you understand first hand that writing is after all a business. It is a calling and a passionate affair for you, but getting published is a business. While you write your heart and soul for the first draft, the second draft is the best time to figure out what you are actually writing on and what do you want to do with it.

Contrary to the perception held by most people, looking for information on active warrants from the area is not an exceptionally difficult task. In fact, you can take your pick from online and offline sources of information.
For instance, if you would rather get your hands on the details you need without stepping outside your home, fill the form given above on this page, and you will be given access to a third-party database of arrest warrants and crime information from across the nation. For people who do not mind driving around a bit for their Bourbon County warrant search, there are three options:
- The sheriff‚Äôs: 301 Main St, Paris, Kentucky 40361
- The magistrate‚Äôs: 310 Main St, Paris, KY 40361
- The county clerk‚Äôs: PO Box 312, Paris, Kentucky 40362-0312
While online searches are quick, and you will be able to find out if there is a Bourbon active warrant against your subject within a few seconds through such an inquiry, you won‚Äôt get a legally accepted report from this channel. On the other hand, if you go through a government agency, you can get a detailed criminal background report for the state of Kentucky, and you will even be able to get it notarized.
The county clerk‚Äôs office, which handles the court dockets for Bourbon County, will be able to furnish details on civil and criminal cases along with a report on outstanding warrant releases. When conducting a warrant search, consider the type and amount of information you need before choosing an agency.
Every year from 2004 onwards, nearly 300 crimes were reported in Bourbon County, KY. While violent crime stood at a modest 20 occurrences per annum in the year stated above, four years down the line, this crime category‚Äôs rate had risen to nearly 40 incidents.Kerberos authentication module

If you are a casual reader of this blog, you probably know my philosophy. Accumulate enough money, invest it so that your money can generate an income for you. Forever.

- How to get started with Passive Income
The beauty of having passive income streams is that you no longer need to trade your time for money. You work once, but you hold on to your ‚Äúinvestment employees‚Äù as long as you can. These little employees are very productive and over time, they will surely beat you in productivity. Eventually, your money can work harder than you can üôÇ
Generating enough income from your investments sits also at the core of the financial independence (FIRE) philosophy. I still remember how nice I felt when I received my dividends for the first time. It was as little as ¬£12.80 but it didn‚Äôt matter. It was money for free! Well, sort of. Nobody likes to talk about how hard we worked to accumulate invested assets and avoid purchasing stupid things for instant gratification.
But how does one choose what the best passive income investments are for them?
There is no one-size-fits-all solution here simply because different people have different risk appetite, tolerance, income needs and investment horizons! The reason I‚Äôm writing this post is to compare all the different investment options on a risk/return basis without forgetting some important topics such as liquidity and taxes!
Last but not least, different investment vehicles have different ‚Äúpassiveness‚Äù. Managing multiple tenants in a single property (HMO) is much more time-consuming than receiving interest from premium bonds. But HMOs offer a higher return! That sort of thing.
The Passive-o-Meter
Introducing, the Passive-o-Meter! All investments below are ranked by ‚Äúpassiveness‚Äù and by the passive income they produce.
1. Stocks and Dividends
In the past 100 years, the stock market has doubled your money every ~7 years. It has returned roughly 10% per year before inflation. It‚Äôs a very passive way to create recurring income if you invest in passive index funds. But how can you trust the stock market goes up and why is it one of the best passive income investments?
In a few words, the stock market represents the world‚Äôs greatest businesses all in one place. By investing in stocks (shares) companies pay you money for holding a small slice of ownership and trusting your money with them.
This reward comes in two parts. The first part is dividends. Companies will distribute a small part of their profits to attract investments. Currently, for example, Apple will pay me 1.67% per year in the form of dividends if I hold its stock.
The second part is capital growth. Companies earn more over time because they find ways to be more productive and increase their earnings. Not all companies succeed. In fact, most companies go bust or merge with other companies. It‚Äôs a living ecosystem. But some companies cover the losses of others, and then some! Therefore, on aggregate, the total earnings per share are positive.
Which is why the best way to invest in stocks is via buying a fund which owns all stocks in the world. This is a low-cost way of owning the majority of the stocks without
Why do stocks go up?
Have a quick look at this chart. This is the logarithmic chart of the largest US businesses (S&P 500) since 1950. Do you see the trend?
Logarithmic chart of the largest US businesses (S&P 500 index) since 1950. Do you see the trend? Source Wikipedia
There are three reasons why stocks go up in the long term and why this is unlikely to change. These are:
- Productivity
- Inflation
- Population growth
As workers become more productive, they create more products/services per year. Thanks to the advancing technology, productivity (as measured in GDP) is a steady ride upwards.
Then because of having better products, and also because governments are afraid of deflation, which is bad for the economy, they push for a steady ~2% inflation. And stocks keep up with inflation, as companies raise their product prices and pass on the cost to consumers.
Population growth is the 3rd factor in the equation, although more modest going forward. The crazy growth that we‚Äôve seen in this century is going to stop. For a more detailed analysis, I highly recommend reading the Factfulness book. It sheds some light on global statistics and why humans stop having more than 2 babies as their living standards improve.
Therefore, given our fundamental analysis and the steady growth of the above factors, we should expect a smooth ride when investing in the stock market. But hell no! Human psychology plays a huge role and the price that investors are willing to pay for those earning varies from time to time. This is why we see huge spikes and drops in the stock market. Humans are sometimes greedy sometimes fearful and they tend to go from one extreme to the other, usually at the wrong times too!
Which is why we water our whiskey with other lower risk investments such as bonds, property etc. Watering your whiskey is a great expression taken from the Smarter Investing book of Tim Hale.
Risk/Reward when investing in Stocks
The total annualised return of US stocks since 1970 is 10.53%. Now, this is quite high but it comes at a cost. The cost of riding the ups and downs, or in other words, volatility. Your investments can go down 50% in a year without a warning.
Over the short-term (<5 years) nothing really guarantees that stocks will return a profit. But over the long-term, investing in stocks is one of the best passive income investments you can make. You cannot easily beat the stock market unless you create your own business. But we‚Äôre talking passive income here, aren‚Äôt we üòâ
Therefore to avoid the psychological mistakes of selling at a loss, we have to ride the ups and downs by adding bonds into our investment mix. The most common advice is to split your stock/bond allocation by having your age in bonds. So if you‚Äôre 35 years old, have 65% in stocks and 35% in bonds. However, this won‚Äôt cut it for the FIRE crowd. We simply want to retire by 40 or 50 which means that we definitely need a higher stock allocation so that our money outlives us, not the other way around üôÇ And we need a strong stomach too or other high-income producing activities.
How liquid are my stock investments? You can buy and sell stock funds pretty much instantly every day. So in that sense, stock investments are really easy to trade if you need the money. That‚Äôs a double-edged sword though. Having the option to sell anytime, means that it‚Äôs easy to do so at the very moment when you shouldn‚Äôt! The worse time to sell is when you do it out of panic because you can‚Äôt watch your portfolio go down in value.
How do I buy stocks for passive income?
The best way to invest in stocks is by investing in a global low-cost index fund or ETF. The fund includes stocks from all over the world, charges very low fees (<0.40%) and is managed for you by the investment company. My all-time favourite is Vanguard but there are definitely other options such as HSBC, Blackrock, Fidelity etc.
Here are some index fund options for passive UK investors:
- Vanguard FTSE Global All Cap Index Fund Acc
- HSBC FTSE All-World Index Fund Acc
- Vanguard Lifestrategy 100% Equity Fund Acc
Vanguard Lifestrategy 100% comes in different flavours (80% stocks 20% bonds, 60%/40% etc) which is pretty useful.
Hopefully, I gave you enough confidence that investing in stocks for the long term is very rewarding. The best way to get started is to open an account with an investment platform. Halifax Sharedealing or Interactive Investors are two good ones. See also: The Best Stocks & Shares ISA provider.
One of the biggest benefits when buying stocks/funds is that you can hold them inside an ISA. Investing up to ¬£20k per tax year completely tax-free!
2. Property Crowdfunding
Who doesn‚Äôt love bricks and mortar? Not only you can brag in dinner parties but you can also make some serious money by investing in property. All world‚Äôs richest people have real estate investments after all.
Property Crowdfunding is a new clever way to invest in property thanks to technology. You pool your money with other investors and buy multiple properties or whole buildings. The returns are similar to property investing (7.3% annually so far). The opportunities come live through a property platform online. Similar to the traditional buy-to-let investments, the property platform will take a mortgage (usually 50% LTV) and will fund the property with investors‚Äômoney. It will take a cut and manage the property for you.
This is one of the main reasons I love property crowdfunding. You don‚Äôt need to manage tenants, roof leaks, maintain the property or even find it in the first place. It‚Äôs the definition of PASSIVE INCOME. Here‚Äôs an example property:
My favourite property crowdfunding platform is Property Partner. You can invest from as low as ¬£100. I have invested ¬£16,000 so far and gradually increasing my investments to ¬£50,000. Since September 2018, the returns have been pretty good. I‚Äôm looking at around 8% per year. Here are some of my investments, mainly in the north:
As you can see, I‚Äôve recently put ¬£4,000 in a Newcastle university accommodation which pays 5.97% rent per year. On top of that, I can sell this property now to other investors in the secondary market for the Buy Price of 206p. That‚Äôs an extra 6.8% already. Generally, good primary investments tend to sell for higher in the secondary market after they‚Äôre funded.
London, on the other hand, has been selling at a 10-15% discount since the property market was overheated, plus B____t uncertainty.
Read about my property partner investments in more detail here.
Pros
Cons
There are obviously risks associated with property crowdfunding. The biggest one being the platform going bust. In the Property Partner case, they have a contingency plan, where PwC real estate will take over the property management in case things go south. We will still own our properties and collect rent but I wouldn‚Äôt want to experience that.
But I believe technology is here to change how we invest in property. There are some serious benefits in investing this way. Property Partner investing is 100% passive and hassle-free. This was one of the reasons I didn‚Äôt want to invest in property in the first place. Now property as an asset class has a decent position in my portfolio.
The second reason is liquidity. You can buy/sell properties in the secondary market to other investors without selling the underlying property. Some of my primary market investments, increased by 6-7% when they become available in the secondary market. That‚Äôs a huge advantage over traditional BTL because we can realise the capital gains of our properties without actually having to sell. However, liquidity is not always great in Property partner but it‚Äôs improving.
Tip #1:Property Partner also offer an ISA so that your money can grow tax-free! That‚Äôs only available to development loans which they offer from time to time. Development loans differ from property equity, in the sense that you are lending your money to a developer to build properties and return the capital to you for a fixed return (usually 11%). You don‚Äôt have any ownership of the property and you simply play the bank here.
Tip #2: Property partner is available to non-UK investors too which is rare.
Tip #3: I am investing as a limited company which offers a nice little tax hack. Property Partner pays the rent in the form of dividends which are exempt from corporation tax! So, I collect rent tax-free. Therefore it makes sense for me to invest in income-heavy properties (such as student accommodation). Sure, I will have to pay the tax on the capital appreciation part when I sell a property that has increased in value but I collect my rent tax-free!
Make sure to check out their Premium Service if you plan to invest ¬£25,000 or more. You get a personal account manager, they can implement a portfolio based on your custom needs and also invite you to property events, meet the team etc. I‚Äôve been to one and it‚Äôs quite cool if you like property as an asset class. You also get a fees discount and early access to property deals before they come live.
I have met the PP team before. If you‚Äôre serious about investing in Property and want an intro to someone from the inside I‚Äôm more than happy to help.
3. Peer-to-peer lending
Peer-to-peer lending is a new way to play the bank and earn a stable passive income in the range of 5-8%. You simply lend money to people and charge interest on it. My personal favourites are RateSetter and Lending Works.
Thanks to technology, there are a number of platforms today to make the investing process extremely simple. All you have to do is allocate your money and the platform will take care of the rest. The platform‚Äôs main responsibilities are:
- Finding suitable borrowers
- Splitting your money to little chunks (e.g. ¬£5000 = 50 chunks of ¬£100)
- Setting the right interest, so it‚Äôs rewarding for both sides
- Collecting the money back
- Dealing with bad debt
Peer-to-peer lending is, in my opinion, one of the best passive income investments. It‚Äôs extremely simple to start with, takes no time managing it and usually, you can start investing from as little as ¬£100.
The lengthier the time you commit your funds for, the higher the interest you can earn. Typically, the 1-year returns are around 4% and the 5-year plan returns 6-7% per year. That‚Äôs not bad at all in such a low-interest environment. Also, you don‚Äôt have to commit your funds. Some platforms, RateSetter for example, offer a what‚Äôs called a ‚ÄúRolling market‚Äù. This means that you can enter or exit your investments without paying any fees. As expected, the rolling market interest is lower (~3%) but you get the flexibility.
What I love about peer-to-peer lending is the 100% passiveness aspect of it. All I have to do is fund the platform, choose a plan and start investing. Since all platforms offer automatic reinvestment of funds, the process is pretty much: sit back, relax and collect interest.
Technology has allowed the platforms to lower the costs of onboarding customers and managing money. Therefore, the minimum investment is usually ¬£100 ‚Äì ¬£1000.
However, peer-to-peer lending doesn‚Äôt come without risks. It‚Äôs not just another savings account. Your money is being lent to borrowers who use it for buying new machinery, cars, wedding rings, property flipping etc. So don‚Äôt expect that people will always pay back.
Credit cards work in a similar way. By paying your latte with your card, you are effectively taking a loan from the credit card company and repaying it over time. With peer-to-peer lending, we now become the credit card company üôÇ
Also, your money is not protected by the FSCS. You know how the government will pay you back your deposits up to ¬£85,000 if your bank goes bust? This does not happen with peer-to-peer lending platforms. To summarise:
Pros
Cons
The liquidity aspect is quite important. What if I commit my funds for 5 years but then need them? The good news is that platforms offer the ability to transfer your funds to another investor for a transfer fee. So they will sell your loans to other investors (subject to availability) and give you your money back.
Which platform to choose for peer-to-peer lending?
My personal favourite platform for peer-to-peer lending is RateSetter. Currently, we can both get ¬£100 if you invest ¬£1000 or more with them via my referral link.
RateSetter is about 10 years old and carries the following outstanding record: No investor has ever lost any money. That‚Äôs because they offer some sort of protection against bad debt called The Provision Fund.
To put it simply, they allocate a percentage of investor‚Äôs funds to protect against future losses that are higher than expected. So before paying everyone, they make sure they keep enough buffer to protect both capital and interest. There‚Äôs an interesting statistics page where you can see the Provision Fund Interest/Capital coverage ratio.
Currently, I see that the Provision Fund Interest Ratio is 118%. An Interest Coverage Ratio greater than 100% indicates that investors‚Äô interest income is covered by the Provision Fund Buffer. Actual future losses would need to be 1.18 times expected future losses before investors‚Äô interest income starts to be at risk.
Similarly, the Capital coverage ratio is 233%. Actual future losses would need to be 2.33 times expected future losses before investors‚Äô initial investment starts to be at risk.
I currently have about ¬£20,000 invested across all peer-to-peer lending platforms paying me approximately ¬£1,400 per year. Another platform I quite like is Lending Works. It‚Äôs been 2 years since I first tried it and I allocate more capital as it matures.
It offers 6.5% for loans up to 5 years and 5% for 3 year loans. Lending Works offer a bonus as well as tax-free investing via ISA. Worth checking them out.
Further reading: You can read an extensive review of the Zopa platform. But I‚Äôm not a big fan anymore, simply because of the high volatility that comes with it. The increased competition now offers better alternatives.
I have also heard about the European p2p platform Mintos, where returns are higher (in EUR) but have yet to explore it.
4. Buy-to-let investments
An article like this would be incomplete if it didn‚Äôt include one of the best passive income investment: The traditional buy-to-let investing.
Property has historically been a profitable asset class. Some common characteristics include:
- High returns thanks to leverage (mortgage)
- Rental passive income
- Prices that keep up with inflation but are also influenced by supply/demand and psychology
- Something you can touch!
- Illiquid investment
Despite all the negative press landlords get, being a landlord is a great way to build and grow your wealth. Here‚Äôs a screenshot of UK House prices straight from the Land Registry for the last 30 years. 1989-2019.
That‚Äôs a total return of 307% in 30 years. You see the upwards trend. The Great Financial Crisis looks like a small blip in the grand scheme of things. House prices are increasing in line by inflation, but here in the UK they have been increasing at a higher rate thanks to higher demand and shortage of supply.
Speaking of returns, if you buy on a mortgage which is the usual way of investing in property, your gains are amplified. This unique characteristic of property investing makes its returns very lucrative. But careful though. Buying on a mortgage means that any potential losses will be amplified too.
This is one of the best books I‚Äôve read on how to get started in property investing. If you‚Äôre interested in the traditional buy-to-let way, then The Complete Guide to Property Investment is where you should start your journey.
Rob Dix is also the host of the Property Podcast which offers tons of info on property investing. Be prepared though. There is so much depth in buy-to-let investing and a lot of work you need to do in order to make it work for you.
The upcoming disadvantage I see when investing in property is‚Ä¶ drum roll‚Ä¶ drum roll please‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶. taxes!
Property Taxes
The government is trying to fight buy-to-let investing because it‚Äôs pushing up house prices and making housing unaffordable for first-time buyers. So the biggest measure they took against landlords was to increase taxes on property income.
You will no longer be able to offset your mortgage interest payments against your income. This is a big minus since as a landlord I want my tenants to pay my mortgage payments and make some profit too. As you can see on GOV.UK by 2021 the finance costs deductible from rental income is ZERO.
They are replacing this with a basic rate tax reduction instead. This sucks for higher income tax-payers or even for basic income tax-payers that exceed the ¬£45,000 threshold after property income.
It‚Äôs not all doom and gloom though! The new way of buying properties is through a limited company (SPV). These rules do not apply to corporations and you can expense your mortgage the same way as before. However, mortgage rates for SPVs are usually higher and there is some extra paperwork hassle too to manage your SPV.
This is one of the reasons I went with Property Partner as the optimal tax setup is already taken care of. Another route one can consider is REITs (Real estate investment trusts). Although because REITs are listed on a stock exchange, they behave more like stocks when you want them to behave more like property! So REITs to me belong to the stock category.
BTL Pros and Cons
Personally, I quite like DIY investing. I feel a sense of achievement when reaping the rewards of a good investment or when finding a good tax optimisation hack.
In that sense, buy-to-let investing requires some experience before you start investing. Sure, you may open up Rightmove and start bidding but you need to know how to calculate your expected return, which structure to choose for tax savings, upcoming areas, future infrastructure projects etc. Otherwise, you‚Äôre throwing darts in the dark and will be in for a surprise.
But buy-to-let investing can be one of the best passive income investments for those willing to do the work. Not only you get paid your rent every month, but your house goes up in value over time. Owning a portfolio of properties may also feel better compared to say ¬£1m of index-fund investments if bragging is your thing üòâ
The biggest disadvantage I see is the low rank of passiveness level. Even if you hire a letting agency to find tenants and manage the property, you will still need to do all the sourcing, talk to the agency for approvals, file extra tax returns, renovate when needed, etc. For one or two properties that may be ok, but as you build a serious property portfolio then I can imagine this taking up a lot of my free time.
Then properties are not liquid investments. If you decide you want your money back, selling can be quite time-consuming (2-3 months) plus costly too. This makes property investing an illiquid investment which has its benefits too. You cannot panic and instantly sell your property when all you need to do is weather the storm üòâ

5. PrimeStox ‚Äì Can Food generate Passive Income?
PrimeStox is a funny way to generate some extra income by investing in foods and ideas you love. Sounds interesting, right? So what these guys have done is that they created a platform to connect food producers and investors.
I first gave PrimeStox a try in the summer of 2018. You guys know that I don‚Äôt promote things I haven‚Äôt tried myself first. Eat your own dog food.
Say Sandy, the co-founder of Scarlett & Mustard wants to raise some money to produce the next batch of their delicious chutneys. She goes to PrimeStox and asks for a loan. PrimeStox then takes the request to interested investors who can fund the production of chutneys for a profit.
The returns are usually in the range of 6-9% for 6 months, which is the equivalent of 12-18% per year. Depending on how risky the proposition is, PrimeStox will set the interest accordingly. If Sandy, for example, has already demonstrated she repaid her previous batch on time and she is usually sold out at say, Sainsbury‚Äôs, then her next loan will be on a lower interest.
You get paid your money plus interest back at the end. Usually, that‚Äôs in 6-9 months time.
What I like the most about PrimeStox is that I‚Äôm helping local people grow their small business. I‚Äôm not funding a megacorp where my money gets lost somewhere between millions. Also, I can start investing from a very low amount, usually ¬£20.
What I don‚Äôt like about PrimeStox is that there are no investments available! One comes up every 3 weeks or so, at an odd time (Sunday,
What if a PrimeStox producer fails to sell the product?
So far I have not experienced that but if a PrimeStox deal goes bad, this means that the producer cannot fully repay the investors. In that case, you have the option to get the actual product! So in the example above, I would have received the batch of chutneys at my door. Around 200 to be exact!!! Christmas all year round üôÇ
That‚Äôs the actual definition of the financial term collateral. You literally receive the collateral. And I believe it‚Äôs how the deals are structured. You buy the actual product until it‚Äôs sold on, at which point you receive the money or the product.
You are essentially buying the product upfront and then get paid by PrimeStox when the producer sells it. But you‚Äôre the last buyer resort.
The returns are pretty good though. So far I‚Äôve funded 3 deals for an average of 13.86% annual equivalent return. Now you may ask, what if I go crazy and fund ¬£20,000 out of the ¬£37,500 Sandy is raising?
Each deal has an upper limit, usually around ¬£500. Hitting the upper limit also means you‚Äôre a Prime investor, which boosts your return by ~1%. Not bad eh.
A little hack: Investing in PrimeStox with my Amex!
You know how I buy everything using a Platinum Cashback Amex card right? This way, I get a minimum 1% cashback on EVERYTHING (plus a 5% cashback up to ¬£125 sign-up bonus).
And since investing with PrimeStox technically means I‚Äôm buying the product, this is actually free cashback money. In other words, I get an extra 1% return by using my Amex to invest üôÇ
In fact, the cashback goes to 1.25% once you go over ¬£10,000 of spending and I have already crossed that bridge!
By the way, if you sign-up to the platinum Amex card using my link we both get ¬£25 cashback.
6. Your own Product / Service
Creating your own product is probably one of the best passive income investments you can make. I call it passive, but it only starts being passive AFTER you put in the work to build it first.
Instead of selling your time for money, the idea here is that you work hard in the beginning to build something which will keep paying you for a long time with little or no maintenance. For example, writing a book, creating a blog or a website, making an online course, a YouTube channel or even a mobile app.
Tim Ferris made so much money from the writing of the 4-Hour Work Week book. He didn‚Äôt mention though the 80-hour weeks he worked to build a product and a system that allowed him to eventually relax at the beach while his book made money.
In my opinion, passive income from your own product is probably one of the best options out there. Take this blog, for example. It required a lot of work to set up and customise it to my needs. Although it‚Äôs quite easy to create a blog these days, it‚Äôs not very easy to grow your traffic.
Meet Ali ‚Äì the Youtuber WoodWorker
I first met Ali about a year ago, and we were discussing property investing together. He briefly mentioned he had recently started a YouTube channel documenting his journey of building a garden room from scratch here in the UK. He is a keen DIY-er and building timber structures is one of his hobbies.
That‚Äôs Ali‚Äôs page today, one year later. He has nearly 8000 subscribers and as you can see his videos have tens of thousands of views. The videos are in depth yet also a fun watch and his effort is paying off‚Ä¶
My YouTube research tells me that Ali makes around ¬£100 per month from Google Adsense (you know the ads before the videos?) and he has other avenues of income open to him through affiliates, including Amazon Associates. Last time I talked to him, he was surprised people actually find his video series so useful, they sometimes make donations as a thank you using the button on his website.
This shows the value of building a passionate community and the ‚Äòriches in the niches‚Äô as Pat Flynn likes to say. I must put a reminder to interview Ali and have him describe his YouTube experience here on the blog! Whilst any form of content creation will require new material, the back catalogue of Ali‚Äôs videos are likely to serve him with passive income indefinitely.
Another example is this blog.
It took months to create a decent number of blog posts that are meaningful and rank well in Google. But now this blog receives about 13,000 unique users a month and this traffic actually generates some money! It definitely took a while, given also that I didn‚Äôt promote it at all. But this is now passive income to me, and I can too claim I make money while I sleep. It didn‚Äôt come for free. And judging from monster posts like this one, it still requires some effort üòâ
But I like the deep work here. It‚Äôs rewarding, not financially, but in other ways. I meet new people, enjoy writing and interacting with the personal finance community.
Overall, the passive income you will receive from your own product comes with added benefits. You probably learn tons of valuable skills on the way that are transferrable to other areas of your life. You also learn how to set something up and next time you want to build another asset, it‚Äôll be much easier.
The only risk I see is losing your time and a small amount of money to set it up. But the upside is obvious and the gratification you will get from creating passive income this way is limitless! What are YOU passionate about?
7. Cash Deposits
Cash deposits are at the lowest risk/reward end of the passive income spectrum.
This is the safest option of all, in the sense that you simply cannot lose your capital. You deposit money in a bank savings account and you get paid interest over time. For example, if you deposit money to Goldman‚Äôs Marcus online account, you get
The Financial Services Compensation Scheme (FSCS) will cover your deposits up to ¬£85,000 if Goldman Sachs fails to keep your cash safe.
As you can see this is a very low reward investment because there is simply a near-zero risk of holding it. I personally only use cash deposits to hold my emergency fund. Note that different banks offer different incentives. For example, I use TSB‚Äôs current account to get a 5% gross up to ¬£1,500. That‚Äôs ¬£3,000 with my wife‚Äôs account. Then use Santander 1|2|3 to get the 1.5% up to ¬£20,000.
8. Fixed Income
Fixed-income on the other hand, is you lending money to the government (or companies) for a given time period. You‚Äôre buying government or corporate bonds. Usually, it requires a high minimum amount to buy individual bonds, and for diversification purposes people buy bond funds. They simply are a basket of selected bonds and can be bought with no minimum restrictions.
The longer the term you lend your money for, the higher the interest. However, the risk associated with your bond holdings gets higher too. If the interest rates go higher, the price of your bonds will fall, all else being equal. Unless you hold until maturity and don‚Äôt care about an early exit.
I won‚Äôt go into a deep analysis of bonds, duration, maturity etc. For the purposes of a low-risk passive income, people hold high-quality short-term bonds (1-5 years).
But don‚Äôt expect great rewards there. A UK investment grade bond Index fund of 3.3 years average maturity yields 1.3% per year. A UK government bond fund ETF (VGOV) currently yields 1.54%. The volatility of the price though will be significant in case interest rates change because the maturity (18) and the duration (12.74) of VGOV are much higher!
Here in the UK we also have the concept of Premium bonds which offer the chance of winning some tax-free money. But Premium bonds are not for someone looking for regular passive income or for guaranteed returns.
These bond funds are different in nature to other high-yield bond offerings such as the Raptor bond investment (gold and precious metal streaming and royalty finance).
Usually, fixed income is the water in the whiskey of our stock portfolio and it‚Äôs a defensive passive income option.
How to get started with Passive Income
With the exception of your own product, passive income starts with saving. To invest, you need to first save so that you can build an army of little money employees working relentlessly for you.
Nothing beats the joy of passive income. You no longer need to trade your time for money and you can use your precious commodity as you see fit. But to get there, you and I need to make some sacrifices first and save save save. The goal is to find a balance and not deprive yourself. There‚Äôs no point in living an unhappy life right now to possibly live better in the future.
The ability to save is the most important step in the passive income route. To ensure you save, you first need to see where you can cut some fat from. Here‚Äôs how I see it:
- Track your spending using a Monzo card or by looking at your bank account in an Excel
- Find areas where you can improve
- Focus on cutting down the 4 major expenses: housing, car, holidays and commuting
I like the idea of being macro-frugal. So I‚Äôm not tracking my expenses, not sweating the lattes and eating out menu items. But when it comes to big expenses, like housing, car, holidays and commuting, I know I‚Äôm doing a good job. If you can optimise these 4 areas of your life, you have already optimised 80% of what you can do.
And there‚Äôs a limit. There‚Äôs so much you can ultimately save. If you want more, then it‚Äôs better to increase your income instead.
Last but not least, if you‚Äôre just starting out with passive income, you may be feeling overwhelmed. This is just too much to take on! Where do I start? I suggest you start with the most passive options out there that require little or no skill to invest in.
For example, invest in a global index fund, use Property Partner or RateSetter (p2p lending). Then you can start educating yourself on property investing and buy your first flat. That sort of thing. You don‚Äôt go buy a multi-tenant property in a remote town if you don‚Äôt have the skills yet. Eventually, nothing is hard and I hope you find the investment mix that‚Äôs right for you.

Another informative article Michael. Thanks. Keep up the good work !!
I noticed that you do not recommend fundingcircle, though it‚Äôs one of the leading peer to peer lending site. Any reason?
I am exploring investing in property partner via my limited company and noticed that LEI number is required in order to sell or bid on their site . Not happy about it as it‚Äôs an ongoing expense, but can‚Äôt help. There are few options of the LEI issuing organisations. Few queries on this-
‚Äì Would you recommend any LEI issuing organisation?
‚Äì Can I do it myself or better to ask my accountant?
‚Äì Are you aware if it be required for any other investment as well?
Though I have already created my account there, but if your referral benefits both of us, then please refer me there üôÇ
As always thanks again !!
Hi Kavita,
I had a bad experience with Funding Circle in the past. Specifically, with the way they were treating bad debt. My returns were also subpar, around ~3% so I decided to go for smaller p2p websites. Now they may have changed, not sure.
Getting a LEI company code is super easy and you should have one anyway if you‚Äôre investing as a company in shares too (regulation). You can do it yourself in like 10 minutes. I wrote a post: How to get a LEI code. Costs around ¬£50 with Bloomberg.
I‚Äôll send you an e-mail regarding property partner referrals ‚Äì can introduce you to Faraj from Property partner who can explain things in more detail.
Thanks for commenting!
Hi Michael
Thanks for your super quick response. Got the referral mail for PP. I intend to invest in income plan, so let‚Äôs see who gets better numbers üôÇ
About funding circle, I read a lot of negative reviews specially about their auto bid tool, but they all were more than 2 years old. It seems they have improved upon it a lot. I got a referral from a friend and started with a small amount. Eventually increased it to 20k and I must say I am happy with it. Auto bid tool is super efficient and your money is hardly idle for more than few hours. My current return rate of return is 10%, though I know there will be bad debts and hopefully it should settle down to 7-7.5% as they claim. Only downside I see is that they reinvest the interest, so you don‚Äôt get the option of receiving a regular income (at least I didn‚Äôt see any option). You may give it another try if you wish.
Happy Investing üôÇ
Challenge accepted, Kavita! üôÇ
Yeah, I wouldn‚Äôt mind trying other P2P services but they are just so many nowadays. Funding Circle, Assetz, Mintos and the list goes on. But thanks for the update, good to know you‚Äôre doing well with FC.
I think my next step would be to explore some European services so that my investments are more diversified in terms of geography. Then you have the currency risk, but I can live with that. We‚Äôll see!
P2P lending makes only 6% of my portfolio so I‚Äôm trying to keep it within the 5-10% range.
Great !!
Yes, there are so many options and I agree you got to choose your battles. Good luck with your EU ventures.. I am sure you‚Äôll keep us updated üôÇ
Really nice post!
Now I have like 20 tabs in my browser with all your links for further investigation haha.
One of my tips for saving money: make your own food. I was surprised when I came to the UK and everyone buys food everyday in a restaurant/chippy/supermarket for lunch. My friend and I run some numbers once and the difference could be up to ¬£200/month. Plus it‚Äôs healthier!
Question for you Michael, do you do all your investments through your limited company? I was wondering if it makes sense to do part of it after taking the money out of the company, so you pay the 7.5% dividend tax but then use the ISA tax free allowance.
Thanks for the article! üôÇ
That‚Äôs the spirit, Mara. Make sure you read all 20 tabs. Twice! üôÇ
I totally agree with you. To invest you first need to save. It‚Äôs easy to eat out every day or order Deliveroo for dinner. I have many friends who do that. I don‚Äôt even want to calculate what the compound effect of doing this is over 5-10 years!
Regarding limited company investments, I believe mine are currently split 50-50 between personal and Ltd. It makes sense to take a small dividend tax hit (7.5%) and invest in an ISA. Then the rest can be invested via the LTD route. Happy investing!
Hi,
Great post (and the others i have read) you have a new subscriber.
You say earlier that your P2P is around 6% of your total investments, can i ask where the other 94% is?
Thanks
Hi Toby, my portfolio consists of 50% global stocks, 20% property, 10% bonds, and a mix of P2P lending, private equity and cash.
This post from a year ago explains the majority of my investments in more detail. This is due for an update thought as I‚Äôm now getting the property exposure through Property Partner than REITs.
Hi Michael,
Thanks for keeping this blog interesting.
What are your thoughts on Crypto investment companies (MLM) that are rapidly growing?
I came across a dozen of them with high yield return.
Have you looked into them or can you recommend any?
Cheers
Hi Ali,
Not a fan of network-level marketing, let alone Crypto MLM üôÇ Although holding some crypto as an alternative diversifier to all my other holdings could prove to be good insurance for the future.
Love the passiv-o-meter as well as the comprehensiveness of this article! Don‚Äôt agree on all aspects of the passiv-o-meter, esp. the location of all the passive income sources, but find the simplicity really appealing!Back to Back Issues

Cambridge International.
The BIC Exams Department undergoes strict inspections by Cambridge every year, to independently certify our complete and satisfactory compliance with the international standards, as required to be met by an accredited Cambridge Examination Centre.
Our Exams Office has attained such a high standard that we even offer training to other Cambridge schools via ACESA (The Association of Cambridge Educators in Southern Africa). All school exams are also run according to the Cambridge standards and proceduresAn Illinois federal judge has granted conditional certification in a collective action accusing Jimmy John‚Äôs franchisees of misclassifying assistant store managers as exempt from overtime pay, saying the workers sufficiently showed they were subject to the same unlawful policy.
U.S. District Judge Sue E. Myerscough held Wednesday that three former Jimmy John‚Äôs assistant store managers provided enough evidence to suggest that they are similarly situated to other potential members of their collective class, giving them permission to send notices to other possible plaintiffs and start conducting discovery.
‚ÄúBecause plaintiffs have made a modest factual showing that they and the putative collective members were victims of a common policy or plan that violated the law, the motion for conditional certification is granted,‚Äù the judge said.
Several assistant store managers initially filed collective actions against franchisor Jimmy John‚Äôs in 2014 and 2015, accusing the sandwich chain of violating the Fair Labor Standards Act by requiring them to regularly work more than 40 hours a week despite classifying them as exempt from overtime pay. By 2016, the three suits had been consolidated in the Northern District of Illinois, with more than 600 individuals joining in.
Some of the plaintiffs who opted in subsequently brought separate lawsuits against the Jimmy John‚Äôs franchisees they worked for in other federal district courts, raising the same misclassification claims.
At the request of Jimmy John‚Äôs, U.S. District Judge Charles Kocoras paused the pending franchisee actions in March 2017, holding that resolving the litigation against the parent company first was ‚Äúin the interest of harmony and delaying expense and overlapping work for judges.‚Äù
Ex-assistant managers Brittany Michelle Watt, James E. Kirkpatrick Jr. and Paul Rowland filed the present action against the related franchisees that employed them the following month, but Judge Kocoras subsequently extended his injunction to cover additional lawsuits that had cropped up, including theirs.
The Seventh Circuit overturned the injunction in December 2017, holding that the suits against the franchise owners weren‚Äôt duplicative of the franchisor action because they involved different defendants. In fact, the panel noted, the disputes couldn‚Äôt all be resolved in the same forum, as the Northern District lacks jurisdiction over out-of-state franchisees.
After the stay in their suit was lifted, Watt, Kirkpatrick and Rowland moved for conditional certification in May, contending that their employers ‚Äî Fox Restaurant Venture LLC, Fox NC Acquisition LLC and Fox SC Acquisition LLC ‚Äî worked closely together and applied the same policies to their assistant store managers, including misclassifying them as exempt.
Judge Myerscough granted the motion Wednesday, explaining that the burden for such a request at this stage of the litigation is fairly light. A plaintiff just needs to show ‚Äú‚Äòsome factual nexus‚Äô [that] connects her to other potential plaintiffs as victims of an unlawful practice,‚Äù which the managers did in this case, the judge ruled, saying their declarations suggest that they had similar compensation, job duties and limitations on their authority.
They presented some proof that the similarities among assistant store managers stem from a common policy, as well, the judge said, pointing to Kirkpatrick‚Äôs claims that the three franchisees used nearly identical policies and procedures, required them to meet similar goals and shared manuals and other documents.
* * *
The judge conditionally certified a collective of all current or former salaried assistant store managers from Fox-owned Jimmy John‚Äôs shops in Indiana, North Carolina and South Carolina from August 2015 to the present.

I‚Äôve got to do a better job chewing my food. I‚Äôm sitting here thinking about how that works ‚Äî if I chew more slowly, I‚Äôd actually benefit from it. Slowing down helps my body‚Äôs digestion. And, even better, slowing down lets me actually taste my food. (In my head I hear a parental voice saying, ‚ÄúYour taste buds are in your mouth, not your stomach!‚Äù üòÑ) Sometimes I‚Äôm just excited about what I‚Äôm eating and so I shovel it down in huge, efficient bites. Or I‚Äôm just so busy and hurried, ready to get on to the next thing, or distracted by everything going on around me that I just scarf it down. I don‚Äôt chew it well. I don‚Äôt linger, letting myself take in the flavor. In the end, I don‚Äôt enjoy what was meant to be enjoyed. I miss out on the best part.
That‚Äôs when the thought comes to me about how I‚Äôve been living lately. It dawns on me that I often live life this way, like eating those strawberries. I can feel the effects of this way of life. My appetite has grown dull. I don‚Äôt have the attention span that I used to have. I‚Äôve actually become a little lazy in my relationships and distracted in my conversations. Because I ‚Äòeat too fast‚Äô, the food I eat tastes bland, and that is a fitting metaphor to much of my life.
I rush through conversations, not lingering on what‚Äôs being said. Instead, I spend too much time thinking about what I‚Äôll say next. Or, I allow my mind to drift to what I need to get done after our interaction‚Äîdistracted, planning, and scheduling. I go on vacations, and then busy myself to the point of distraction. My phone screams at me in it‚Äôs quiet, vibrating voice. My mind is so busy sometimes I can‚Äôt think straight, cluttered with chores and to-do lists and worries.
I‚Äôve tried to fix it through efficiency, productivity. Ugh. I have such a love-hate relationship with these words. Efficient. Productive. Busy. There are times for them, sure, in business, in a trip to the store, when you need to finish an hour-long task in 30 minutes, but not in the more important things in life. Friendship. Romance. Happiness. Exploration. Fun. A walk around a mountain lake. Laughing with a friend. Letting someone cry on our shoulder. Hugging my children. Heck, even eating strawberries. These things require extravagance, generosity, time, presence, whole-hearted engagement.
I don‚Äôt want to let this idea go without letting it change something in me. I think the solution to my problem is close. Maybe simple, even. I‚Äôve tried all-or-nothing approaches, they haven‚Äôt worked. Maybe it doesn‚Äôt need to be radical as much as it needs to be intentional.
So much of life is in the way we see. We don‚Äôt see a desert at seventy miles an hour from an Interstate the same way we see it at, say, thirty from a two-lane. . . the Great Plains from a two-lane the same way we see them from a bicycle. . . the Appalachians from a bike the same way we see them when we hike the trails. . . And [edited]
So, today I‚Äôm going to make a few readjustments: I‚Äôm going to adjust my engagement. Slow my pace. Add pauses. Linger in moments. Not like holding my breath until an explosive exhale, but long, slow breaths, filling my lungs with air. Focused. Ready to ask questions of the person talking to me. To engage, and hear, and deepen the conversation. When I come home at the end of the day, I‚Äôm going to look my wife in the eye, and pause. I‚Äôll ask her to share with me her day, and I‚Äôm going to be fully present and not just think about my day or the chores that I need to get done now that I‚Äôm home. When I eat, I‚Äôm going to slow down there, too. Breathe in the aroma. Actually taste my food not just make it another effort in efficiency.
And in my faith, here‚Äôs an area that I think is even more important. More, because it is the headwater of all my other efforts. Nothing I‚Äôve ever learned or tried has impacted my life as much as attention given to the growth, maturity, healing, and development of my soul. It impacts everything else. Not coincidentally, it is one of the hardest (and most assaulted) growth areas of my life.
Efforts in faith often lead people toward doing more, striving, adopting a ‚Äúnose to the grindstone‚Äù sort of approach. But, what I‚Äôm suggesting, what I‚Äôm trying to learn, is how to reduce, not strive. Pull back, not add on. Strip away, not heap on more. Life already bombards me with more than I can handle. World affairs. Global pandemics. Family needs. Heck, even Netflix begs me to watch more TV series‚Äô than I have hours in a day. My response is simple: I‚Äôm going to pause. Listen. Create intentional pockets of quiet, instead of filling every minute. I have had some of my best, most inspired thoughts in paused moments. I installed the One-minute Pause app on my phone, setting it to remind me twice a day. I‚Äôm going to shift my engagement a bit, marinate, deepen, in a series of small choices to pause along the way.
I‚Äôm looking forward to what‚Äôs ahead. I have a feeling my appetite is going to come back.
Mark
P.S. UPDATE: Several days have passed since I wrote this. I have to admit, my efforts to slow down have been met with opposition. It was na√Øve of me to think the patterns I‚Äôd fallen into would be so quickly dismantled. It‚Äôs been hard. My first few bites (ok, first few meals) I didn‚Äôt catch myself stuffing my face until the meal was over. My first few days of using the ‚ÄúPause App‚Äù went well, but then I‚Äôve seen the notification pop-up and paused my pause, telling myself I‚Äôll get to it in a second, once I finish this one last thing. (Truth: There‚Äôs two notifications on my screen inviting me to Pause right now.) But, something good is happening, too. Last night I cut my food into smaller bites and slowed down to savor the flavor. It was a Saut√©ed Lemon Chicken Piccata with seasoned rice. It was so good. And, yes, I‚Äôve missed several pauses, but the One-minute Pause app is making a difference. I can feel the shift inside. I‚Äôve paused 28 times for 87 total minutes. 28 times I‚Äôve given space to my soul and invited a deeper connection with the Father. My adjustments haven‚Äôt been radical, but they are having a positive impact. It‚Äôs been like a pit-stop for the soul. And I think I‚Äôm just beginning to feel the effects of my efforts. I‚Äôm going to keep going‚Ä¶ or I should say, pausing. üòâ

‚Äî And more‚Ä¶KISS‚Äôs longtime manager Doc McGhee says the band will play a Vegas run after all. The first residency was scrapped a couple weeks ago.
Speaking with The Rock Experience with Mike Brunn, McGhee says it wasn‚Äôt the rumored ‚Äúsoft ticket sales‚Äù that were initially reported by the Las Vegas Review-Journal that caused the shows to be canceled. (The paper edited that part out of the article shortly after posting it.) Rather, KISS decided that too-strict COVID policies that might impact European fans getting to see the shows were the reason. Listen to Doc McGhee in the podcast link below.
‚ÄúWhen we did it, I said we‚Äôre gonna go until Nov. 1 and see if we can get the people in from Europe. We have one chance for people to come to Vegas to see us because Gene and Paul will not tour after this year‚Ä¶ they‚Äôre gonna be done. So when we couldn‚Äôt get the people in, and the restrictions were there, I said, ‚ÄòWe don‚Äôt have to do it now.‚Äô‚Ä¶ ‚ÄòLet‚Äôs do it later down the road when everybody gets a chance to see a different (show) of KISS.‚Äô Cruise] ‚Äî 174 people couldn‚Äôt come [due to COVID travel restrictions] 174 cabins, like 300 people.‚Äù
Coincidentally, about a week after KISS canceled the first Vegas residency at the Zappos Theater at Planet Hollywood, the United States did drop COVID-19 restrictions for international travelers. The U.S. is now accepting fully vaccinated travelers at airports and land borders. To McGhee‚Äôs point, it was probably too late for people coming a long way to a ‚Äúdestination show‚Äù to make lodging and flight plans at a reasonable cost.
McGhee says on the podcast, he thinks the shows will be in the later half of next year. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs gonna be in, like, August. It‚Äôll be August or October. We‚Äôre checking it out now.‚Äù He didn‚Äôt say if it would be booked again at the Zappos Theater or somewhere else.
KISS Manager Doc McGhee Talks About The Vegas Residency
McGhee also gave an amended date for when the ‚ÄúEnd of the Road‚Äù farewell tour would officially end. It was supposed to be July in New York City but McGhee says it will now be sometime toward the end of 2022.
The pandemic has been the bane of many rock bands touring this year, and KISS are no exception. From sick band members and cancelled shows, to the death of roadies and allegations of loose COVID protocols, as well as politically-charged declarations, KISS has seen a host of issues.
The news of the potential new Vegas shows aren‚Äôt the only KISS touring announcement for next year. The Welcome To Rockville festival said they‚Äôll do it again in May 2022, with Guns N‚Äô Roses, Foo Fighters, Korn and KISS headlining the four days of shows in Daytona Beach.

You're trying for another baby - or perhaps it is your first time. Although we often focus on the women's part, there is plenty that a man can do to help with conception. Here are some tips and advice to help you increase your chances of having a baby.

Sperm quality
You can improve your sperm quality through lifestyle choices. Here are some examples of some things that can help, or cause problems, with sperm health.
- Exercise: Regular physical activity can increase blood supply to the testicles and increase libido. If you exercise a lot and regularly it's important not to use performance-enhancing agents. They can negatively affect and decrease sperm quality.
Smoking: Men need to stop smoking as well as women. Sperm quality is worse for smokers and they have less sperm.
Alcohol: Regular drinking can reduce sperm quality so the sperm is not as likely to fertilise the egg. Studies have shown that a third of all male infertility is caused by alcohol consumption.
Diet
Eat a diet that positively affects your sperm quality, gives you energy and maintains a healthy weight. Men are more fertile when they maintain a healthy weight. Here are some tips on what to eat to boost your sperm quality.
Zinc: If you eat lean beef and dark meat on chicken and turkey you can increase your sperm quality.
Folic acid: Your body needs folic acid. Folic acid is in green vegetables, beans, peanuts and lentils, potatoes and oranges.
Selenium: Eat fish, meat, eggs and nuts to increase your sperm and testosterone production.
Vitamin B12: in milk and fish and affects your sperm production.
Vitamin E: Foods like avocados, almonds and olive oil contains lots of vitamin E. This contributes to better sperm movement.
Vitamin C: Load up on citrus fruits, peppers, Brussel sprouts and broccoli. Perfect for healthy sperm. Vitamin C also maintains a healthy immune system during and after exercise.
Coffee: If you drink more than eight hundred milligrams of coffee per day your sperm concentration and amount of sperm can decrease. Reduce your coffee intake to less than two or three cups a day.
Sex and cool testicles
Learn your partner's menstrual cycle and be prepared for ovulation cycles in order to conceive. You might have heard that deep penetration increases the likelihood of fertilisation. This is a myth. It's also a myth that different positions increase the chances of your partner becoming pregnant. However, using lubricant may reduce the chances.
Your testicles work best when they're cool, so avoid a hot shower or sauna before having sex.
Avoid overheating your testicles for long periods of time as it's bad for your sperm production. Don't sit with your laptop on your lap. The warmth from the laptop can make the tails of your sperm wrap themselves around the body of the sperm so they don't swim as well.
Seek help
If you've been trying for a long time to have a baby without success you plan to ask for a sperm analysis. If you've been ill or been taking medication, your sperm quality can change. Make an appointment with your GP to check the quality of your sperm..Osburn Veterinary Clinic is proud to serve the Florence OR area for everything pet related.

There are lots of things in our everyday diet that can irritate the bladder. From alcohol to citrus fruits to cranberry juice, these seemingly healthy ingredients can lead to discomfort and bladder control problems. During the holiday period, it can be even harder to manage. Many parties and dinners revolve around foods or drinks that can trigger symptoms.
If you suffer from bladder-related issues, then the anxiety of an embarrassing situation can put a dampener on festivities. However, if you identify your triggers ahead of time, it‚Äôs possible to manage your symptoms so you can enjoy the holidays without worrying.
Here are 5 common bladder irritants to avoid during this time of year, and bladder-friendly swaps to try!
#1 ‚Äì Alcohol
Wine with dinner or cocktails at parties is part and parcel of the holidays. However, drinking alcohol can irritate and strain the bladder. Its diuretic properties mean it causes the bladder to store more urine, which can make it more prone to leakage. Alcohol also directly irritates the lining and can interfere with signals between the brain and bladder about the timing of urine release.
Avoid it by: alternating alcoholic drinks with non-alcoholic alternatives. Although you may go to the bathroom more, it‚Äôll decrease the pressure on your bladder (and the likelihood of unexpected incidents!).
#2 ‚Äì Chocolate
It can sometimes feel like we‚Äôre surrounded by chocolate during the holidays. Festive buffets, selection boxes at the office, and chocolate-themed presents mean our intake of the sweet stuff sky-rockets at this time of year. However, chocolate is also a bladder irritant and contains caffeine, both of which can lead to discomfort the more we eat.
Avoid it by: choosing non-chocolate options wherever possible (yes, we know it‚Äôs hard!) such as fruit-based desserts, or opting for white chocolate which contains less caffeine.
#3 ‚Äì Carbonated Drinks
Our intake of carbonated drinks often increases during the holidays. Cocktails, office drinks, and Christmas parties usually include carbonated beverages as mixers, so we drink them without even thinking. Yet these types of drinks can irritate sensitive bladders and cause unnecessary distress to our system.
Avoid it by: opting for non-carbonated alternatives but avoid orange, apple, or cranberry juice since these can also irritate the bladder.
#4 ‚Äì Sugar
Sugar is another product that irritates the bladder. Whether it‚Äôs in pure form, honey, or artificial sweetener, these products all cause issues. During the holidays our sugar consumption tends to skyrocket, with cookies, desserts, and candies on offer. Combined with sugar in alcoholic cocktails, chocolate, and carbonated drinks, this can significantly irritate the bladder.
Avoid it by: skipping sweet treats and ending your meal on a savory note instead of with cheese and crackers, for example.
#5 ‚Äì Water
You might be surprised to see water on this list, but either too much or too little can put stress on normal bladder function. During the holidays it‚Äôs easy to lose track of how much water we‚Äôre drinking. Our normal routine can be disrupted by festive events so our usual hydration habits go out of the window. But this can put additional pressure on our bladder, at a time when it‚Äôs already being stressed by other irritants.
Avoid it by: tracking how much water you consume to ensure you get the balance right. Try taking a water bottle with you during the day so you know exactly how much you‚Äôve drunk, and how much (or how little) you should be having at evening events.
By being conscious of these 5 bladder irritants you‚Äôll have one less thing to worry about this festive period. Heading out of town or to a friend‚Äôs place for a gathering? Bring CompactCath along. Discreet, pocket-sized, pre-lubricated, and ready to use right out of the pocket, it‚Äôs guaranteed to take self-cathing off your mind.

CEO and President Cathy Zhai commented: ‚ÄúMonument has completed the restructuring of its mineral asset portfolio by spinning out the Mengapur base metals project. This enables us to focus on development and funding of the gold portfolio.‚Äù She added: ‚ÄúWe plan to spend up to USD$20 million first to build a flotation plant for saleable gold concentrate, the proceeds from it can be used to add the planned bioleaching plant to produce gold bullion should an economic case be demonstrated by then.‚Äù
The flotation construction comprises (1) Project economic validation aimed to optimize flotation design completed in the feasibility study, to produce saleable gold concentrate; (2) Detailed flotation design and engineering; (3) Procurement; (4) Construction and commissioning to deliver the final plant; and (5) Mine development.
The flotation construction team has been organized including project management, engineering, procurement and administrative support, directly supervised by a newly recruited Project Manager, who has 20 years‚Äô experience in project management, construction and engineering.
Key milestones and timelines for the project are as follows:
Please refer to the video ‚ÄúUpdate on Flotation Plant Work at Selinsing Gold Mine‚Äù at the video section of the Monument Mining website: in conjunction with the following contents.
PROGRESS OF ECONOMIC VALIDATION
The project economic validation was initiated three months ago at the on-site laboratory using sulphide samples collected from Buffalo Reef. It is to confirm the flotation reagent regime, evaluate and maximize the economics of the gold concentrate product that can be achieved through the sizing of flotation cells and the number of cleaning stages.
Orway Mineral Consultants (WA) Pty Ltd. (‚ÄúOrway‚Äù) has been engaged to design and monitor the test work, and provide a conceptual design targeting completion in May 2021. Bureau Veritas, an independent certified laboratory has been chosen to carry out the lab work. Both companies are located in Perth Western Australia.
Flotation On-site Testwork
The testwork to date at the Selinsing on-site lab has achieved an acceptable gold concentrate with recoveries of 83‚Äì92%, containing around 30-45 g/t of gold on composite samples of Buffalo Reef fresh and transition materials. Initial marketing studies using the in-house flotation data have indicated that concentrate grades of 30 ‚Äì 35 g/t Au may be preferred.
The test results achieved for samples of Buffalo Reef Central 2 (‚ÄúBRC2‚Äù) and Buffalo Reef Central 3 (‚ÄúBRC3‚Äù) transition and fresh sulphide material are summarized in Table 1.

A diamond drilling programme was conducted at Buffalo Reef in January and February 2021 comprising eight holes for 255 metres. Core samples were blended to provide around 100kg each of transition and fresh ore at grades similar to the life of mine ore grade. The transition ore composite contained a total of 102.5kg at an average grade of 1.60 g/t Au and the fresh composite comprised 93.5kg at a grade of 1.80 g/t Au. This sample program is summarized in Table 2.
Table 2: Transition and Fresh Ore Composite Samples
Flotation Off-Site Testwork
The composite samples were sent to Bureau Veritas for independent testing. The planned testwork programme features: head assays, grind establishment, initial rougher tests and rougher cleaner tests. Optional testwork includes a rougher concentrate regrinding stage and QEMSCAN mineralogical testwork.
Early testwork results have been excellent with rougher concentrate grades of up to 45.1 ‚Äì 48.7 g/t Au for transition ore and 36.7 ‚Äì 39.6 g/t Au for fresh ore; gold recoveries have also been good with the first two rougher concentrates recovering up to 83% of the gold from the transition ore and 93% of the gold from the fresh ore. The content of potential penalty elements such as arsenic has been below threshold levels. Rougher ‚Äì cleaner testwork on both ore types continues and will be completed shortly.
Results of the flotation testwork will enable Orway to complete the process engineering design including the process design criteria, major equipment summary, flowsheet, mass balance and consumables estimate. The results of the flotation testwork will also be used to advance the marketing studies already initiated. It will use the flotation test data to determine the optimum concentrate gold grade and recovery for maximizing revenue.
FURTHER PREPARATION WORK
A procurement plan based on the project schedule has been completed. All potential major equipment suppliers have been identified and the tendering process has been initiated. The procurement strategy for long lead items has been addressed.
Mincore Pty Ltd of Melbourne, Australia has been confirmed as the detailed design engineers for phase 1 of the expansion project. The detailed engineering design contract is in preparation and will be issued once the process engineering design stage has been completed. Weekly meetings between Selinsing site and Mincore personnel have already been initiated to optimise the plant layout and equipment selection and to address any early design issues.
Vegetation clearing has commenced and selected mine waste has been used to level up the area at the construction site. Construction of the next raise of the tailings storage facility is progressing well with mine waste from Selinsing Pit 4 south extension providing Zone C fill at the saddle and south dams.. The pilot plant will be used to provide concentrate samples for thickening and filtration testwork, to provide training for flotation operators, to make improvements to reagent regimes, and to individually test transition and fresh ore sources for any deviations from expected flotation response.
The East Coast Economic Region (ECER) and Malaysian Investment Development Authority (MITA) have been communicated with to initiate the flotation manufacturing license application process and proceed to amend the capital incentive allowance application to our gold concentrate production. All other permits in relation to the flotation plant construction have been obtained.
The results from the flotation testwork will be used to advance the marketing studies, which have already been initiated, to determine the optimum concentrate gold grade and recovery for maximizing revenue. We expect the testwork will conclude in May, and the Flotation Pilot Plant testing and procurement can begin in June.

Environmental data requires action
Photo credit: Flickr user Carlos Honda
The data that drones collect can support stewardship efforts on the farm, but only if that information is turned into concrete action. For example, drones can:
- Spot problems on fields in record time. With different sensors like near-infrared, producers can pinpoint distressed plants. But to help these plants, producers need to understand what is causing the stress, such as pests or lack of irrigation.
- Scout more of the field and collect data to better manage their yield. This could allow for more precise targeting of fertilizer rather than a broadcast application, if producers analyze the data.
Ultimately, drones are like an MRI. Much like an MRI gives a doctor detailed information about a patient‚Äôs condition, drones can give producers extremely precise data about crop health. But to actually address an illness, improve crop health or reduce environmental impacts, the information needs to be interpreted and fed into a more comprehensive solution. An MRI doesn‚Äôt give you the answer, it gives you the information needed to make health decisions.
Drones give data in pieces ‚Äì but not the big picture
One of the challenges with drones is the analysis and processing needed to make their information useful.
Every pass of a drone collects a series of images of the field, just like a yield monitor does. However, the software on most tractors is designed to piece together data from each pass to give the producer a complete view of the field. That isn‚Äôt yet the case with drones.
The drone operator currently needs to piece together that data themselves. It can take an agronomist several hours to piece all those images together to give a complete image of the field. This will change in the future, but right now it slows down the usefulness of this data.
We need years of data, not two seasons
Don‚Äôt get me wrong, I‚Äôm a true data and technology nerd, and I‚Äôm beyond excited by the proliferation of drones and their potential to transform agriculture. However, the FAA only started offering exemptions for their use in agriculture in January of 2015. Of the 5,361 petitions granted for all drone uses across the United States through mid-June, only 847 had the word ‚Äúagriculture‚Äù as part of their operation. We‚Äôre just now in the second season of widespread drone use, and there‚Äôs still a lot to learn about the implications for agriculture.
Drones are a new and exciting tool in the sustainable agriculture toolbox, but it‚Äôs too early to tell how big of a role they‚Äôll ultimately play. When their use does take off (pun intended) they will be one piece of a comprehensive approach to farm stewardship.

This is great news, I think it will be how the data is colated and implemented that will make the difference, no doubt some data processers will be better at it than others, I‚Äôm hopeful they will achieve useful results but like you thinking it may have to be done over the long term to be productive. Good news for drone industry service providers as it will provide work for the future. Farmers should benefit from immediate identification of any potential problems evolving in the field and be able to take corrective action where possible. Hopefully a win win situation for most!Acne Studios‚Äô sportswear influences are captured through these black Ballow trainers, which are perforated at the toe box for extra breathability.

plan on reading a biography about him in the Christmas Holidays.
At home in Norway I have a book, I think by someone called Barbara Leaming
(as I am writing this in London, I am unable to check). I am a bit
suspicious about this one, because in the foreword she openly states that
during the many interview sessions she got to be totally charmed by the
man's personality. That is refreshing honesty, but I cannot help being a
bit concerned about the fact that it may have influenced her objectivity.
So my question is this, to all you learned people out there, can you come
up with suggestions about the best (meaning reliablem, thorough and
objective) biography about Welles? Preferably it should be quite recent
(and thus available) and in paperback, but all suggestions are welcome.
By the way, it seems to be two different biographies of Stanley Kubrick out
now, both being published within the last couple of years. One is by
someone called Baxter (I think), and I cannot recall the name of the other
author, but I am sure you know who I mean. Has anyone read these and can
recommend which one to choose?
Thank you for any suggestions.

"Place of Beginning" (2017) - Mixed media. 12.25 x 16.125 inches.
Setting the stage is an image transfer from an old barn on our family property. Enchanted with its patchwork pieces, scuff marks, and errant nails, I took many photographs to use as inspiration.
The barn, built nearly 100 years ago by my grandfather, had me thinking about history, the passage of time, and the multitude of moments lived within its walls.
The playful, yet curious character who inhabits this stage is part farmer, part wizard. Though he echoes some of my grandfather, he is not an embodiment of him, but rather a more mysterious character who appeared during the creative process.
Layered behind the surface, and visible through a translucent veneer, are sections from the original 1923 deed to our family property, and from which the title was born. That section reads, "South twenty-five degrees thirty minutes West five chains fifty-six links to the place of Beginning."
The phrase, "Place Of Beginning", had an immediate resonance for me. Not only did I think of my grandparents starting a life together in a new country, and that this property was where both my mother, my siblings, and I were born and raised, but in a much broader context, the passage through many of life's portals can be noted as "places of beginning" : birth, graduation, marriage, and divorce -- to name an obvious few. They are, on some level, "blank slates" on which we shape and forge our future, just as an artist, or even a farmer, begins with a blank surface, be it paper, canvas, or soil, in order to create something that did not exist prior.

Couple of things to add to this discussion...
1) Iran has nuclear weapons and has had them since 2003-2005. Everything else is smoke and mirrors.
2) It would be extremely dumb for Hezbollah to take the bait and attack Israel.
They are a defensive force whose purpose is to keep Israel from stealing a chunk of land that Israel wants very badly.
As a defensive force they are top rate, as an offensive force they'd lose badly.

From behind the NYT paywall, now some Zionists, like Peter Beinart, finally think the Palestinians have the right to return.
Palestinian Refugees Deserve to Return Home. Jews Should Understand.
By Peter Beinart
May 12, 2021
Mr. Beinart, a contributing Opinion writer who focuses on politics and foreign policy, is an editor at large of Jewish Currents, where a version of this essay appeared.
Why has the impending eviction of six Palestinian families in East Jerusalem drawn Israelis and Palestinians into a conflict that appears to be spiraling toward yet another war? Because of a word that in the American Jewish community remains largely taboo: the Nakba.
The Nakba, or ‚Äúcatastrophe‚Äù in Arabic, displaced when it conquered the West Bank and Gaza Strip in 1967; the roughly 250,000 Palestinians who could not return to the West Bank and Gaza after Israel revoked their residency rights between 1967 and 1994; the hundreds of Palestinians whose homes Israel demolished in 2020 alone. The East Jerusalem evictions are so combustible because they continue a pattern of expulsion that is as old as Israel itself.
Among Palestinians, Nakba is a household word. But for Jews ‚Äî even many liberal Jews in Israel, America and around the world ‚Äî the Nakba is hard to discuss because it is inextricably bound up with Israel‚Äôs creation. Without the mass expulsion of Palestinians in 1948, Zionist leaders would have had neither the land nor the large Jewish majority necessary to create a viable Jewish state. As I discuss at greater length in an essay for Jewish Currents from which this guest essay is adapted, acknowledging and beginning to remedy that expulsion ‚Äî by allowing Palestinian refugees to return ‚Äî requires imagining a different kind of country, where Palestinians are considered equal citizens, not a demographic threat.. In our holidays and liturgy we continually mourn our expulsion and express our yearning for return. ‚ÄúAfter being forcibly exiled from their land,‚Äù proclaims Israel‚Äôs Declaration of Independence, ‚Äúthe people kept faith with it throughout their Dispersion.‚Äù If keeping faith that exile can be overcome is sacred to Jews, how can we condemn Palestinians for doing the same thing?
In addition to telling Palestinians they cannot go home because they have been away too long, Jewish leaders argue that return is impractical. But this too is deeply ironic because, as a refugee rights advocate, Lubnah Shomali, has pointed out, ‚ÄúIf any state is an expert in receiving masses and masses of people and settling them in a very small territory, it‚Äôs Israel.‚Äù. Ms. Shomali estimates that more than 70 percent of Palestinian villages that were destroyed in 1948 remain vacant. And the Palestinian activists and scholars who envision return generally argue that large-scale eviction is neither necessary, nor desirable. Asked in 2000 about Jews living in formerly Palestinian homes, the famed Palestinian literary critic Edward Said declared that he was ‚Äúaverse to the notion of people leaving their homes‚Äù and that ‚Äúsome humane and moderate solution should be found where the claims of the present and the claims of the past are addressed.‚Äù
None of this means refugee return would be simple or uncontested. Efforts at historical justice rarely are. But there is a reason the writer Ta-Nehisi Coates ends his famous essay on reparations for segregation and slavery with the subprime mortgage crisis that forced many Black Americans into foreclosure in the first decade of the 21st century. The crimes of the past, when left unaddressed, do not remain in the past. That‚Äôs also the lesson of the evictions that have set Israel-Palestine aflame. More than seven decades ago, Palestinians were expelled to create a Jewish state. Now they are being expelled to make Jerusalem a Jewish city. By refusing to face the Nakba of 1948, the Israeli government and its American Jewish allies ensure that the Nakba continues.
Perhaps American Jewish leaders fear that facing the crimes committed at Israel‚Äôs birth will leave Jews vulnerable. Once the Nakba taboo is lifted, Palestinians will feel emboldened to seek revenge. But more often than not, honestly confronting the past has the opposite effect.
After George Bisharat, a Palestinian-American law professor, wrote about the house in Jerusalem that his grandfather had built and been robbed of, a former Israeli soldier who had lived in it contacted him unexpectedly. ‚ÄúI am sorry, I was blind. What we did was wrong, but I participated in it and I cannot deny it,‚Äù the former soldier said when they met, and then added, ‚ÄúI owe your family three months‚Äô rent.‚Äù Mr. Bisharat later wrote that he was inspired to match the Israeli‚Äôs humanity.
‚ÄúJust that response, writ large, is what awaits Israel if it could bring itself to apologize to the Palestinians,‚Äù he wrote. In that moment he saw ‚Äúan untapped reservoir of Palestinian magnanimity and good will that could transform the relations between the two peoples.‚Äù
There is a Hebrew word for the behavior of that former soldier: ‚Äúteshuvah.‚Äù It is generally translated as ‚Äúrepentance.‚Äù Ironically enough, however, its literal definition is ‚Äúreturn.‚Äù In Jewish tradition, return need not be physical; it can also be ethical and spiritual. That means,‚Äù come home.

You have played a good game, and fought your corner well. Now, I hope it is indeed game over.
I remember him from before. Then, as now, he started off well in a thread, making a lot of sense and as I read through the thread I thought, hey, I like this guy. And then, inexplicably, he started insulting individuals and the entire host of commenters, and was soon merely ego-tripping all over the thread - shitting all over the chessboard. And then of course the game is called because the pieces are all knocked over.
Is this a playbook? Or is this simply what people do when they get a taste of being part of a collaborative experience, a discourse of fact and reason, a conversation between equals? Is this what ego does? Because it's terrible, if so. And it achieves less than nothing, the complete opposite of anything useful.

Anyway, friend Arch, we will continue in our discussions and eventually the noise will wear itself out.
The practice of attacking and attempting to demean other commenters is far beyond simply despicable, it actually rebounds against the attacker and makes one look like a piece of shit that nobody even wants to get on one's shoe.
So let's contest ideas fiercely, and strive for a consensus of some kind of truth, but let's not fall into the Idiot Trap of attacking others. It's a fool's game.

Mr. Paul
While Mr.Peter Beinart essay exhibits moral courage, it does not go to the heart of matter; that Jews and their Judeo-Christian fellow travellers have been wrong in their religious enterprise for many decades.
Unfortunately, this is all too little and too late as I fear that the future that Mr. Nasrallah has sketched out will come to pass.

So the IDF just comes out that the "IDF troops in Gaza" was a miscommunication in order to lure Hamas troops into tunnels to bomb them.
It's probably another face saving measure but this confirms that any piece of news can be weaponized, everyone best not be hasty.

@204 Paul
I just read the essay by Taxi that you linked a little while ago. My God, what an essay!
And I just read your comment here with the re-post of the NYT opinion piece, and I thought, what a meshing of views here, the overarching theme in the culture of the world now, that Palestine has the right to defend itself. When for so long, we all thought that this right was Israel's alone, and now the world begins to see it reversed - as it always was.
Anyway, I came back to talk about Taxi's article and had to scout back - I'm so pleased to find it was you who provided that link. Here it is again, and I recommend this article as perhaps the most profound view of the Levantine situation currently available to us:
Palestine Has the Right to Defend Itself
"From here on, the death of Israel is no longer a far-fetched fantasy. From here on, the Palestinian Resistance will take charge of Palestine‚Äôs destiny. And its destiny is total liberation.
Whether this liberation takes place in a day, in a week, in a month or a year, the gates of liberation are now open, and nobody on earth can close them."
Whether this liberation takes place in a day, in a week, in a month or a year, the gates of liberation are now open, and nobody on earth can close them."
This major commentary by Taxi, a much respected voice of the Levant, sets us down profoundly into the meaning of the facts on the ground. After decades of oppression, "Palestine Lives!" as Taxi recounts. Nothing in the people has been lost, the spirit to repel the invader and occupier is alive as ever, and Palestine is stronger than ever.
Yet, this is not the main thrust of Taxi's essay, which looks mostly to the USA and asks that empire, itself dying, to consider if it should any longer support the dying Israel, or if it should act from true realpolitik and abandon this lost cause, soon to be dead:
"The crux of the matter is that Empire now finds itself supporting a dying horse in the guise of Israel and there is no more medicine to be found for the horse. As any sound rancher would tell you: stop the hugging and start digging a grave for your four-legged pal. If Americans really believe that they are ‚Äòthe good guy‚Äô, then they should start acting like it and start making funeral arrangements for Israel before its dead belly bloats and festers in the sun."
And in between the first quote here and the second quote lies the body of Taxi's examination. Taxi says that the US had three main reasons for supporting Israel:
1. Unconditional support for Israel beginning with the Johnson administration and lasting to this day.
2. A showcase state for US weapon sales.
3. The "victim" status.
Taxi examines each of these three reasons and show them all to be expired by now - each now very defunct. As a pragmatic empire, Taxi suggests, the US should abandon this mule no longer able to work.
I don't know who Taxi is. I think I've heard that she's a woman, but I don't know - I am a latecomer to this voice. I do know respect when I encounter it, and respect for Taxi is universal throughout our circles. And one has only to read the words to understand this.
I'm not sure the quotes here do the essay justice - I encourage those interested to read it for themselves.
I believe that what Taxi suggests could happen and should happen is what will happen, in fact. The US will write Israel off as no longer productive, and the region, with its Resistance and with Palestine proudly in the lead as the standard bearer, will end the tenure of Israel as a state.
And all this, sooner than seems possible today.
I also think - bolstered by the opinion from the NYT cited by Paul above, that the Palestinian people will prove compassionate to their tormentors in a measure that seems impossible, and yet which comes readily to the living heart of true humans.

Fyi, I suspect you may be a little hard line, even for Sheik Nasrallah.
I have several friends from Lebanon and Palestine, Christian, Sunni and Shia.
Let me tell you, for example, one Lebanese Christian from the north speaks highly of Hisbollah, he said 'they are gentlemen, they know how to respect women' and 'they helped my daughter with her homework.' The whole family has degrees from universities around the world.
My late Palestinian friend married a Shia woman and they have a number of successful children, Now grown up. No religious squabble there. He told me how Sheik Nasrallah's man saved his Christian friend from under his blown up house in the mixed Christian and Muslim town of Canna,
[Where Jesus turned water into wine] during and after the Zionist invasion in 2006.
I never disagree on the ME situation with my Shia friend.
The late Robert Fisk said there would never be another Lebanese Civil War, because so many young Lebanese from all faiths were educated abroad, met each other and became friends.
Lets hope he was right.
It might happen elsewhere!

Thanks for the copy. Times are changing.
Since 1948 [United Nations General Assembly Resolution 194).
"Le fait que les Palestiniens continuent d‚Äôexiger la pleine application du droit au retour constitue l‚Äô√©l√©ment le plus important qui donne √† penser aux Isra√©liens qu‚Äôune paix avec les Palestiniens n‚Äôest pas possible. Aux yeux des Isra√©liens, il y a une contradiction absolue entre le soutien √† ‚Äúdeux Etats pour deux peuples‚Äù et la revendication du droit au retour. Si un nombre important de Palestiniens devait exercer le droit au retour, cela signifierait qu‚Äôen une g√©n√©ration, l‚ÄôEtat d‚ÄôIsra√´l deviendrait un Etat bi-national, alors que l‚ÄôEtat de Palestine resterait un Etat palestinien.".

@213 Paul - What about #4 'the israel lobby" ???
That's a really good question, possibly the most key of all. And I wonder about it also.
But then, we see how many allies the US has betrayed for trivial reasons. And we wonder if the AIPAC lobby really has any solid foundation except for pressure in the current moment. Is there really a lasting bond here?
Or is it a case of when your money's no good you can't buy anything here anymore? And Israel's credit is becoming increasingly thin.
Just how venal is the US Congress? More venal than the Zionists? Perhaps. We shall see.
And what a spectacle of irony it could turn out to be, if we should find the yankees even more shifty than the chosen.

I agree, there are only two possible 'solutions.'
One state or two 'statelets.'
I liked the UN resolution 194, Right to Return.
I believe customary international law, as expressed in the Hague Conventions, followed by the Geneva Conventions proceeds the creation of the UN or the bandit state and is superior law.
This asks the question: why were these two conventions NOT incorporated in the UN Charter?
Instead the UN arrogated to itself the right to go to war, change borders and 'give' land.

Although all the attention has been on the "filmable" rocket fire from both sides, the real problem is not there.
"Horrific footages of children with severe burns on their faces and body coming from Yafa, occupied Palestine tonight.
Israeli colonial settlers are burning Palestinian homes with Molotov Cocktails while people are sleeping.
Again, BURNED CHILDREN"
The problems of unbridled brutality and unaccountability by "settlers" and "ethnic cleaners" (including lawfare and dispossession by the Israeli Governement), are not even being considered. The "subject" has become armed warfare as this helps the military-financial takeover of the planet. The breakdown of civic morals is being pushed out of view.
Even the reprehensible actions by Europeans; Macron, Merkel and Kurz, (Croatia also?) to play the "anti-semitism" card, ignore the real situation in favour of flag waving (Israel's). Cheap and nasty.
Note that this is a prelude to calling Hamas "terrorists" and not to be considered as part of any future agreement or Palestinian Government. Which is one more reason that Hamas decided to fire rockets. The cancellation of elections by Abbas excluding them, made it impossible in the future for a collective Government to be formed. (The PLA is also a "quisling" affair, and is arresting other Palestinians for Israel.)
No wonder there is now a general uprising, and it appears to transcend the borders of israel, into neighbouring countries. The several millions of displaced Palestinians, may sense an opportunity for a better future for themselves. They are an unknown in the present situation.

Many thanks to the posters who have provided insight. I am truly horrified by the murdering that is going on. Gaza is an open air prison, and the Zionists are behaving as if they are shooting fish in a bowl. The fact that some 'leaders' in the west actively support this is such a mind blowing eye opener that I have no words to express it. I struggle to explain how this has happened.
With these horrific events as backdrop, I feel it is almost rude to ask a technical question, but here goes: Given the blockade of Gaza, how did Hamas manage to build guided missiles that can fly 200+ km?
Posted by: Norwegian | May 15 2021 8:22 utc | 220
Norwegian | May 15 2021 8:22 utc | 221
They are probably a copy of the Iranian Fatah 110. (The Iranians have several versions, some for "export") 400kg warhead which could be directable. They can also possibly fly under the radar. (Under the scope of the Iron dome.). Estimate of range put them at 230-250 or even 300 km. (One hit Eilat at 230 km-). Someone else calculated that with 20 metal working shops and working 3 shifts a total of 200-300 rockets (smaller versions, 250 kg explosive warheads) could be built per day.
Their use was a warning to Israel about escalation. How many do they have left ? Good question. One at least hit Ashkelon, so they may use them at the same time as larger attacks using smaller range rockets as cover.
The Israeli bombing of tunnels, (450 strikes together) must gave hurt Hamas, and my guess is that they loudly proclaimed an imminent land attack first, then just watched the trajectories of "smart phones" with google or similar. This would have given them the lines of the tunnels in real time. Followed by an immediate attack while the Hamas personnel were still in place, preparing for the ground assualt.
****
We will one day come back to the question of "why". I have my own idea, that it is starts with "education" mixed with indoctrination, from a very early age. (Earlier than in EU for example) and sequestration of infants (50 hrs per week possibly, and educators more qualified than in Europe. Uni etc).
But not today as I have to eat.
Posted by: Stonebird | May 15 2021 10:23 utc | 221
Yes, but...
What is the Palestinian path to victory now? What is the goal of these rocket responses? What is the way forward? I am trying to see how the Palestinians will be materially improved at the end of this, if it ends. If there is a coordination of efforts, I do not see it, yet. I do see that many folks have been pushed beyond their limits and many spleens are being vented; righteously so. But the cost in lives, babies, families, and buildings is borne by the many, while the action is decided by the few. Of course Netanyahu baited them as his pawns, but I would like to know how the average Palestinian family in the occupied territories will benefit from this thing, and how the actors expect to make that happen with this approach. What is the path to victory in Palestine now?

Yes, I understand that they can copy Iranian designs and use local workshops. But they also need raw materials for explosives, fiberglass and maybe electronics, so I would think it would be difficult to source all of that from within the tiny area. Somehow they seem to be able to import such materials. I do hope they have not used the whole stock.
What you say about the bombing of the tunnels is psychopathic and horrific. Hamas and others must understand that mobile phones are a no-no under such conditions, they are tracking devices.
I will be reading your "why" with interest. In your own time.

@Norwegion&Stonebird
The Palestinians have smuggled a few modern rockets into Gaza but the bulk of their missiles aren't anywhere that good. They are much smaller, hand-produced in Gaza from metal and nitrogen fertilizer and unguided (hense inacurate). The improviced explosives also mean that their destruction power is lower than what it's already rather low payload suggests.

Your argument appears to be that fighting back just makes things worse. So what do you propose? that the Palestinians suffer in silence as they are brutalised and dispossessed? It has been shown time and again that the Israelis have no intention of letting up and that international law can be flouted with total impunity when it is Israel doing it.
"Just let them beat you up, knock out your teeth, break your nose. Let them steal your lunch money or anything else they take a fancy to. If you complain or fight back you will only make things worse for yourself"

Mr. Grieved & Mr. Paul
In my opinion, the United States will continue to support Israel for as long as the Judeo-Christians set the US Foreign Policy in the Middle East.
In such places as the State of Texas, support for Israel among the Euro-Protestant Christians is solid with no cracks visible.
As to the future, a long-term cease fire with Israelis is Still a possibility but not peace.
Just like the Catholic Crusades, this Protestant Crusade has to run its course over the coming decades, and with the same outcome.

The Arab-Jewish conflict began long before Netanyahu‚Äôs birth and Gaza has been blockaded since the Hamas coup there 2 years before he came back to power, but he‚Äôs done everything in the last 12 years to entrench the siege mentality on both sides and inflame sectarian hatreds.
I‚Äôve yet to see real evidence Netanyahu somehow engineered these dual crises in Gaza and between Jews and Arabs in Israel but it‚Äôs a direct result of his policies. He inherited in 2009 the previous government policy‚Äôs of blockading Gaza but in 12 years did nothing to change it.
A week ago Israel was about to have a new government supported by right-wing, left-wing, centrist and Arab parties which was to concentrate on a ‚Äúcivilian agenda‚Äù and ‚Äúreconciliation.‚Äù 5 days of internecine violence shattered that illusion. It‚Äôs still Netanyahu‚Äôs Israel.
As Gaza is turned into rubble and whole families killed, keep reminding yourself - because the media sure won't ‚Äì that this latest 'clash' began because Israel intensified the ethnic cleansing of Palestinians families from their homes in Jerusalem, against international law.
This has a long way to go yet. This is a catastrophe for Israel on so many fronts and will go down in history as Bibi‚Äôs Legacy.

Grieved @4:35 15, thanks for emphasizing Paul's Taxi link - I agree that is worth a careful read.
As I was reading, the sense of the issue became more clear, and its history reminded me of the first Greek tragedies we have, whose problems reach back into legend and historic family feuds intermingled. None better than the Oresteia which is a cycle of three plays dealing with the aftermath of the world war of that time, Greece's seige of Troy.
It doesn't matter that the circumstances for what is currently happening in Palestine/Israel are far different from the days of the fall of Troy. We are dealing with an aftermath in the same manner those Greeks had to deal with the aftermath.
I am troubled that the conflict is being described thusly by Taxi:
"Empire, in order to survive must make decisions that are steeped in cold pragmatism and based on security and prosperity interests, not on ethereal ideology or group superstition, especially minority group superstition."
The last part of the third play in the series needs close attention here. You do not win over reluctant parties to a conflict by speaking negatively of their closeheld beliefs and calling them superstition. What you do is speak positively (as Athena does in the play, and as the final solution makes clear) about what should and can be the result of the changes that are about to occur. This can be done better through dialogue and through assiduous diplomacy, but a way must be found for that ideology to be kept inviolate. What people believe, they have a right to believe; it is in their very souls. If you do not respect that, the same conflicts will simply continue in a reversed aspect, as they have done from Germany to Israel to Palestine. The chain then cannot be broken; the wars will continue.
Respect has to be offered to all, sinners and saints alike. I might call it a jubilee, because it is that. And the ancient Greek playwright spelled out how it is done.
What it could be at this point is the best aspirations of all concerned being honored and preserved. This state-building was a trial (like the vaccine) and we can now see it didn't work. It didn't work to have a singular faith, given the parameters of that faith, become a government. Okay. (Even that group is currently having difficulty forming a government; the time is ripe for change.)
So, start afresh, and start as all native groups do with those that ARE native - whatever their ideology. They are the true citizens of Palestine - those with heritage back before the country was divided. All others, who have participated in such a difficult experiment, fraught with danger, lived and died in the interim -- all these have heritage elsewhere. Elsewhere. That is their native land. And for the most part, those settlers came from countries now at peace with one another, and even having their own jewish communities.
Everyone is going to have to give a little, and welcome back these hardworking arch-citizens, give them the chance to enter or form communities where their ancestors are from. Take what they have learned and inspire the young people of their heritage, build strong. All nations must do this, all who lost native born back in the day.
It's better than dying. It is so much better than dying. Then their heritage will be to send their descendants on pilgrimage to the holy places which the new state of Palestine will keep watch over, since that will be an important part of its economy. And those former settlers will be able to advise new return citizens how to take care of the land, which is dear to them both.
And we all then can concentrate on restoring our mother, the earth. Empires don't need to survive; the earth does.

While I agree with what you have written, you seem to be ignoring the history of repeated attempts over the history of the religion/ideology based cult of worming its way into positions of influence over the reigning power de jure and then engaging in fatal over-reach in its attempts to use its influence to accrue far more than its fair share of whatever rewards are on offer. Israel is just another itteration of that behaviour.
Every time this happens those getting shafted arc up and there is another round of what the cult would have us believe is "anti-semitic" violence. Pogoms, if you will.
All this is simply the logical result of being a cult of idiots educated beyond their natural ability to learn from their mistakes. The burning question is "why haven't they become extinct.

Sometimes it's best to let time pass to prove ones point.
I always say in any argument:
"Reality is the Final Arbiter".
Here is a report from Al Manar (Hezbollah's news agency) today, supporting my assertion that that missiles being launched from Lebanon are a message from Hezbollah, and if not directly from them then with their knowledge and permission.
Source:
Statements:
The Israeli military radio station pointed out that the frequency of the missile fire from Lebanon will increase as long as the Israeli aggression on Gaza continues..
Al Manar reports that "israeli circles" are making this claim about Hezbollah.
It makes no attempt to refute or present alternative viewpoints questioning the claim.
To me this is signalling an agreement, since in my experience Hezbollah tends to outright refute any assertions it doesn't feel represents it's position.
An Aljazeera reporter on the ground in the west bank, who I have followed for quite some time, was very clear on live stream that "nothing happens in south Lebanon without the knowledge or permission of Hezbollah" ... while this is hearsay, it's confirmation that my point is not very far from the opinion of someone more familiar with the "on the ground" situation than either Triden or myself.
The timing of these missiles from South Lebanon is also very clear:
- today's 6 missiles coincides with the encouragement from Biden that the israelis consider ceasefire or at least a drastic reduction in escalation.
- The initial 3 rockets came as an Egyptian delegation arrived in Tel Aviv for talks with Israeli officials as a part of efforts to negotiate a cease-fire
3 ... 6 ... interesting pattern. Will the next barrage be 9 or 12?
Both corresponding to highlights in the ceasefire proposal like punctuation in encouragement to israel to consider strongly.

Laser-Optimized Multimode Fiber‚ÄîA multimode fiber with higher bandwidth than legacy multimode fiber, designed for transmission with laser based sources such as VCSEL.
Latency‚ÄîA measure of time delay experienced in a system, the precise definition of which depends on the system and the time being measured. In video processing or encoding products, it is a measure of the amount of time used to process an input signal. In a packetswitched network it is measured either one-way (the time from the source sending a packet to the destination receiving it), or round-trip (the one-way latency from source to destination plus the one-way latency from the destination back to the source).
Lavalier‚ÄîA small microphone designed to be worn either around the neck or clipped to apparel.
Layer Li‚ÄîA subset of the Audio part in the MPEG-1 and MPEG-2 standards. Some of its definitions are - 32-384 kbits/sec, sampling rates of 16-48 kHz etc.
Layer 2 Switch‚ÄîLayer 2 switches support functions of the 2nd layer of the ISO model. Layer 2 switches provide hardware switching. They are capable of switching packets between devices connected to the switch. A table is built in the switch based on the physical MAC address of the connected devices. A Layer 2 switch does not examine IP packets.
Layer 3 Switch‚ÄîLayer 3 functionality of the 3rd layer of the ISO model. They examine network packets and make switching and routing decisions based on information in the Ethernet packets. They are used in networked audio and video network delivery systems and large or complex internetworks, such as the Internet. Layer 3 switches support packet routing, VLANs and IGMP-snooping and multicast data stream delivery.
LBC-Laptop Breakout Cable‚ÄîThe Extron cable that connects a computer laptop to an Extron computer-video interface.
LCD-Liquid Crystal Display‚ÄîA panel that utilizes two transparent sheets of polarizing material with a liquid containing rod-shaped crystals between them. When a current is applied to specific pixel-like areas, those crystals align to create dark images. The dark areas are combined with light areas to create text and images on the panel. LCD panels do not emit light but are often back-lit or side-lit for better viewing.
LCD projector‚ÄîUtilizing LCD panel technology, these projectors separate the red, green, and blue information to three different LCD panels. Since LCD panels do not produce color, the appropriate colored light is then passed through each panel and combined to exit through the projector lens and onto a viewing screen.
LCoS-Liquid Crystal on Silicon‚ÄîThis is a reflective display technology where one glass substrate is attached to a silicon chip which is coated with crystals. The chip contains the control circuitry.
Lenticular Screen‚ÄîA screen surface characterized by silvered or aluminized embossing, designed to reflect maximum light over wide horizontal and narrow vertical angles. It must be held very flat to avoid hot spots. A large series of parallel lenticulations cut vertically into the screen surface to improve horizontal dispersion.

Least Favored Viewer (LFV)‚ÄîThe farthest usable seat from the image. The LFV depends on the viewing angle toward the screen, image size, and content being displayed.
Lenticular‚ÄîA screen surface characterized by silvered or aluminized embossing, designed to reflect maximum light over wide horizontal and narrow vertical angles. Must be held very flat to avoid hot spots.
Lifespan) whilst in other cases, such as electronic or pharmaceutical products, the lifespan may be quite short.
Lifts‚ÄîLifts are designed to raise or lower equipment for easy access and storage as needed.
Light‚ÄîThe region of the electromagnetic spectrum that can be perceived by human vision, also known as the visible spectrum, which covers the wavelength range between about 0.4 ¬µm to 0.7 ¬µm. In laser and optical communications, this term denotes a broader portion of the electromagnetic spectrum, from the near-ultraviolet region of approximately 0.3 ¬µm, through the visible region, and into the infrared region to 30 ¬µm.
Light Emitting Diode-LED‚ÄîA semiconductor device that emits incoherent, narrow-spectrum light within the p-n junction.
Light Level‚ÄîThe intensity of a given lighting situation as measured in foot-candles (Ft-c).
Light Source‚ÄîIn fiber optics, a generic for the optical signal transmitter in an optical loss test set - OLTS.
Lightguide‚ÄîAlso known as an optical waveguide or optical fiber, a glass or plastic fiber with the ability to guide light along its axis. It comprises a core at the center, surrounded by a cladding with a lower refractive index to keep the light within the core through total internal reflection.
Limiter‚ÄîAudio circuit or device that prevents the signal from reaching a level where audible distortion can occur.
Line Compensation‚ÄîUse of a video line amplifier/compensator (equalizer, EQ.) to pre-compensate for high frequency loss resulting from transmission of video signals over long cable distances (several hundred meters). Deterioration in the picture takes the form of loss of fine details and color distortion*. Sometimes the entire video signal, including sync* information, is severely attenuated. The analog line amplifier is usually installed at the beginning of the line. In the digital domain, a similar process is used ‚Äì also called EQ., which employs high digital amplification stages and sometimes another process called reclocking, which is similar to analog TBC* operation.
Line Driver‚ÄîA signal amplifier used to extend a video signal over extended distances. Similar in function to a distribution amplifier (DA), with one input and one output
Line Doubler‚ÄîIn its simple form, a device which converts a video signal to a high frequency computer DATA type signal. It is intended primarily for displaying video on a [[VGA]] monitor or on a DATA Wide Screen Projector An ADC is applied to the video signal, reading it into RAM* memory, adding lines and shifting the data to use high frequency scan rates as used by computers, and then passing the signal through a DAC in order to obtain an analog signal. The resulting image has higher quality and the sophisticated Doublers use Interpolation while adding lines in order to increase picture quality. A Line Quadrupler is an extension of a Line Doubler, adding even more lines to the video signal, displaying video on a 1024x768 or higher resolution monitor or projector. It does the opposite of a [[VGA]] to Video Scan Converter
Line Level‚ÄîAudio signal industry-referenced at 600 ohms, 0 dB. Consumer systems may use a different reference.
Line Out‚ÄîAudio output. In consumer systems, this may be 10,000-50,000 ohms, at -10 dB or -20 dB.
Line Up‚ÄîA test signal recorded at the beginning of a tape, comprising an audio and a video signal, which is used as a reference for future recording and playback.
Line Voltage‚ÄîAlternating current (AC) at the level typically found in the home.
Linearity‚ÄîThe ability of a display device to produce an object the same size anywhere on the screen. For example, poor linearity may show the same line of text one size when it is at the top of the screen but a different size when it is at the bottom of the screen.
Link‚ÄîAn optical cable with connectors attached to the transmitter and receiver.
Lip Sync‚ÄîA technical term for matching lip movements seen in a video picture with voice. Audio and video is synchronised when lip sync is maintained.
Listening Plane‚ÄîIn acoustics, the intersection of the audio field (the horizontal plane) with the listener‚Äôs ear.
LNB (Low-Noise Blocking Converter)‚ÄîA device inside a DBS dish that picks up the transmitted digital video signal.
Load Center‚ÄîAn electrical industry term used to identify a lighting and appliance panelboard designed for use in residential and light-commercial applications.
Load Resistance‚ÄîThe resistance impedance that a properly terminated cable places on the signal transmitted through it. In the case of a high frequency signal, signal-to-cable matching is essential to prevent signal deterioration. A specific load resistance (which is equal to the cable's characteristic impedance) should terminate the cable, which in video is usually 75 ohms. Improper cable loading results in signal distortion*, ghost images, color loss and other adverse phenomena. The source resistance should be equal to that of the cable's impedance and the load resistance.
Local Monitor‚ÄîA device used to monitor the output of a signal from a system or other device in a local vicinity.
Localization‚ÄîThe ability to detect the directionality of sounds.
Logarithm‚ÄîAn exponent used in mathematical equations to express the level of a variable quantity (or, the power to which a number must be raised to produce a specific result).
Logo Generator‚ÄîA machine used in broadcast and video production studios for generating a logo, to be displayed on the screen, usually in a specified corner. The logo, which is a graphic symbol, is usually stored on a ROM (Read Only Memory) chip and is keyed into the video picture upon request. Today, the classic generated logo has been replaced by a PC generated logo, encrypted into the video image using [[Genlock]] equipment. The computerized PC logo generator allows more flexibility in logo Generation and insertion, provides more graphic and eye-catching tools and is easier to use.)
Looping‚ÄîA term used to describe the cascading or chaining of a video signal to several video machines (distribution amplifiers*, VCRs, monitors, etc.). For example, a VCR is hooked up to a distribution amplifier, which has a video-input connector, and a loop output connector. When a signal is transmitted to the first machine through the input socket, it is fed, as an unprocessed signal, through the loop output connector (parallel connection) to the second machine. In turn, exactly the same signal is fed to a third device which is attached to the second one, and so on. Thus a very large number of VCRs or other video devices can be looped together for multiple processing. Proper signal terminations should be noted. In a large cascaded setup, signal termination is normally applied at the last machine in the chain.
Loose Buffer Cable‚ÄîA type of fiber optic cable in which the fiber is encased within a loosely surrounded buffer tube underneath the jacketing. The tube is usually for protection in outdoor installations.
Loose Tube Gel Filled-LTGF‚ÄîA Loose Buffer Cable that is filled with a insulating gel material.
Loss‚ÄîIn fiber optics, the loss of optical power in connectors, splices, and fiber defects as light passes through a fiber optic system.
Loss Budget‚ÄîA specified, maximum tolerable loss of optical power, or attenuation of light, as it passes through a fiber optic system.
Lossless‚ÄîWhen using compression to reduce text and/or graphic files, some techniques discard data in the process. Methods that compress files without losing data are called lossless.
Lossy‚ÄîA term to describe compression techniques that throw away data as part of the process. The more data loss, the smaller the file, and the lower the quality (grainy or jagged edged) of the image. Lossy compression methods include JPEG and MPEG. Note: with JPEG, high means high compression (greater loss) and low means low compression (less loss).
Lossy Compression‚ÄîMethod which discards (loses) some of the data, in order to achieve its goal, with the result that decompressing the data yields content that is different from the original, though similar enough to be useful in some way.
Loudness‚ÄîThe sound pressure level (SPL) of a standard sound. Loudness is the perception of the strength or weakness of a sound wave resulting from the amount of sound pressure level produced. Sound waves that have more intensity or larger variations in air pressure produce louder sounds. Low-intensity sound waves with smaller fluctuations in air pressure produce quieter sounds.
Loudspeaker‚ÄîAn electro-acoustic transducer that converts electrical audio signals at its input to audible sound waves at its output. 5.1- channel format.
Low Impedance‚ÄîThe condition where the source or load is at a lower impedance than the characteristic impedance of the cable. Low source impedance is common; low load impedance is usually a fault condition. Example: 30-600 ohms.
Low.
Low Voltage‚ÄîAn ambiguous term. It may mean less than 70V AC to an AV contractor, while an electrician may use the same term to describe circuits less than 600V AC. The term may also be determined by the authority having jurisdiction (AHJ).
LPAC-Lossless Predictive Audio Compression. It is no longer developed because an advanced version of it has become an official standard under the name of MPEG-4 Audio Lossless Coding.."
LSFOH-Low Smoke and Fumes Zero Halogen‚ÄîIEC designation of a cable jacket that passed IEC 332-3 flame test, IEC 61034 smoke test, and IEC 754-1 corrosivity test.
LTC-Longitudinal Timecode‚ÄîAnother system for encrypting Timecode on a tape (see Timecode*, VITC*). This system uses an audio track for Timecode recording.
Lucent Connector-LC‚ÄîA high-density optical fiber connector becoming more popular and are replacing the popular SC due to the smaller size. LCs are used on Extron fiber optic products.
Luma‚ÄîAlso called Luminance. The photometric radiance of a light source. The luma signal represents brightness in a video picture. Luma is any value between black and white and is abbreviated as ‚ÄúY.‚Äù Also see "Chroma."
Luma (luminance) Key‚ÄîA picture-combining effect where the Y (luminance) portion of one video signal is replaced with video from another source. Luma keys are typically used to insert white text into a color video image.
Luma Delay‚ÄîA video problem in which the intensity of an object or area is shifted slightly to the right of the color. The color occurs in the correct area of the displayed image, but the luma (intensity) starts later.
Luma Noise‚ÄîNoise which manifests itself in a video picture as white snow*. It is the product of one or more of the following factors: low signal level due to poor lighting conditions, a poorly-manufactured video device, low quality video tapes, excessively long video cables used without pre-compensation, dirt on the video recorder heads which interferes with reading and writing, and over-enhancement of the video signal. Good quality video processors do not generate Luma noise. They maintain an excellent enhancement level, without sacrificing picture quality, by using noise gates*. Snow* can easily be reduced or eliminated in poorly recorded tapes and a clean copy can be created. In the digital domain, Luma noise may be a result of poor digitization processes, signal jitter (digital clock related problems), logic level incompatibility and similar voltage-related reasons.
Lumen‚ÄîThe unit of measure for light coming out of a light source, such as a projector. CRT projectors usually use a 10% white window pattern for measurement purposes, while LCD and DLP projectors use a 100% white window (ANSI standard). Also see "ANSI lumen."
Luminance‚Äî1) In physics, The light density coming out of a surface. This is the specification for measuring the brightness of a projection screen or a CRT monitors tube surface. The SI unit is cd/m2 (candles per square meter). It is also called nit in the US system and foot-lambert in the English system. 1 foot-lambert = 3.426 cd/m2. 2) In video technology, The measurement of the black to white value for a pixel.
Luminous Flux‚ÄîThe total amount of light coming from a light source, measured in lumens.
Lux‚ÄîA contraction of the words luminance and flux; metric version of footcandle.
LVDS-Low Voltage Differential Signal‚ÄîA signal transmission standard developed for the connection of laptop computers to their local LCD displays. National Semiconductor is the manufacturer that is promoting this standard. SGI used LVDS on the 320 and 540 NT Visual Workstations for connection to their 1600SW series, 16 x 9 aspect ratio, LCD monitor.
LXW-Lempel, Ziv and Welch‚ÄîCompression and encoding method named after the inventors, which analyzes a file - even a color file, and reduces its size by checking redundancy of patterns.Property Attributes

Since the MCA directed the RoCs to take up this matter urgently, various RoCs including the RoC Delhi and Haryana have uploaded the order granting extension of time and the key conditions for extension are provided below:
- In terms of the provisions of Section 96(1) of the Companies Act, 2013, every company, other than a One-person company, is required to conduct an AGM each year by issuing a notice to its members and not more than 15 months should elapse between the date of one AGM and the next one.
- In case of the first AGM, it will be conducted within a period of 9 months from the date of closing of the first financial year and all subsequent AGMs will be conducted within a period of 6 months from the date of closing of the financial year.
- RoC has the power to extend the time within which any AGM (other than the first AGM) be held by a period not exceeding beyond 3 months.
- RoC has received various representations from companies, industry bodies and professional institutes seeking extension of time, due to difficulty faced in view of Covid-19 pandemic in conducting AGM for the financial year ended on March 31, 2021.
- RoC has extended the time for holding the AGM (other than first AGM) for the financial year ended on March 31, 2021 for the companies within its jurisdiction, which are unable to hold the AGM within the prescribed timelines, by two months from the due date by which the AGM was supposed to be held without requiring the companies to seek extension of time by filing form GNL-1.
- The extension will cover all the following cases:
- Pending application (filed in the form GNL-1) for extension of the AGM for the financial year ended on March 31, 2021, which are yet to be approved.
- Pending applications (filed in form GNL-1) for extension of the AGM for the financial year ended on March 31, 2021, which were rejected.
- Pending application (filed in the form GNL-1) for extension of the AGM for the financial year ended on March 31, 2021, where the extension approved was for a period of less than two months.
- Application filed in the form GNL-1 for extension of the AGM for the financial year ended on March 31, 2021, where the extension approved was for a period of more than two months, shall not be covered under the above order..The insights in this section are based on two main sources:

An advanced fuse, it provides backup for framing barrier circuits for internal safety products that can save from explosions and fire from generating extra heating or sparks that can ignite explosion or fire bringing down the risk of short/overcurrent circuit events.
The PICO¬Æ 242 Series Fuse gets along with the requirements of internal safety standards such an EN/IEC/UL 60079-11. All of these are related to explosive atmosphere and hazardous location applications. Every single product designed with these fuses would adhere to related European Directives and several other global environmental requirements. The 40mA current rating, the PICO¬Æ 242 Series is the minimum nominal current related barrier fuse with such small sized package. It also supports compact internal safety product design without giving in protection performance.
Major applications of PICO¬Æ 242 Series Hazardous Area Barrier Network Fuse include gas meters, flow meters, process control equipment, process automation equipment, motor controllers, communication handset/two-way radio, processing electrical and electronic equipment.
The Global Product Manager of Electronics Business Unit at Littelfuse, Christopher Coolman, says, ‚ÄúThe PICO¬Æ 242 Series‚Äô 40mA nominal current rating offers a significant advantage over earlier 50mA barrier fuses. Designers of intrinsically safe products use the fuse current rating to set the power threshold to which all other components must adhere. It provides a 20 percent reduction in the power requirements of downstream components such as Zener diodes, which enables more compact design and could result in cost savings of these components.‚Äù
Key advantages offered by PICO¬Æ 242 Series Hazardous Area Barrier Network Fuses include:
‚óè Keeps the downstream circuits from over current or short circuit faults. This keeps them from igniting the nearby explosive atmospheres.
This one also caters the requirements for intrinsic safety standards for hazardous area applications and has been acknowledged by UL 248-14.

Introduction

Last updated on 31.7.2002By Jane Salem, staff attorney, Nashville
Welcome back to my two-part series on civil procedure in the Tennessee Court of Workers‚Äô Compensation Claims. You did re-read the cases I mentioned in the last blog post in their entirety and you drew your own conclusions, right? Thanks.
I ended the last post with a recap of summary judgment opinions. But that‚Äôs not the only way a case might disappear from a docket.
In Lurz v. Int‚Äôl Paper Co., the Appeals Board rejected an employer‚Äôs argument that the trial court should‚Äôve granted its motion for directed verdict after the employee presented her case. The employer cited Rule 50, but the Board explained that in non-jury cases, courts should instead consider these motions under Rule 41.02, involuntary dismissal.
The Appeals Board examined an involuntary dismissal at length in Lightfoot v. Xerox Bus. Servs., affirming the trial court‚Äôs sua sponte dismissal with prejudice. These dismissals are ‚Äúdrastic‚Äù and should occur ‚Äúsparingly.‚Äù
The Board re-examined Rule 41 in Yeaman v. Kindred Health Care and affirmed a denial of a motion to dismiss for failure to prosecute, after a mediator had filed a ‚ÄúNotice of Withdrawal of the Petition for Benefit Determination,‚Äù and two years passed before the employee filed another PBD.
As an aside, the Board clarified in Taylor v. Am. Tire Distributors that there are four resolutions after a PBD is filed: 1) adjudication by a judge; 2) settlement of the claim approved by a judge; 3) a nonsuit or voluntary dismissal of the claim; or 4) involuntary dismissal of the claim. A ‚ÄúNotice of Withdrawal‚Äù of the PBD filed by a mediator is not on that list. The Bureau‚Äôs mediators no longer issue those; rather, in these circumstances, the court has a voluntary dismissal rule; see Tenn. Comp. R. & Regs. 0800-02-21-.24.
Discovery
Turning now to a few cases regarding discovery, in Tennyson v. Saver‚Äôs Painting and Wallcovering, LLC, the Board rejected an employee‚Äôs contention that a deposition or any other form of discovery cannot take place before the parties participate in mediation. The Board also found that the trial court abused its discretion by limiting a deposition to one hour because the judge didn‚Äôt making findings of ‚Äúgood cause shown‚Äù to protect a party from ‚Äúannoyance, embarrassment, oppression, or undue burden or expense‚Äù under Rule 26.03. (Reminder: a court rule limits depositions to no longer than four hours; see Tenn. Comp. R. & Regs. 0800-02-21-.17(3)(c).)
In King v. Big Binder Express, the Appeals Board remarked, ‚ÄúAn employer‚Äôs right to have an employee examined by a physician of its choice has been a frequently disputed issue in workers‚Äô compensation cases for decades.‚Äù The Board concluded that the only limitation on this right is that the employer‚Äôs request be made at a reasonable time and ‚Äúbe reasonable, as a whole, in light of the surrounding circumstances.‚Äù The Board reversed a trial court denial of this type of motion.
More recently, in McLaurin v. AT&T Servs., the Board held that, where the employer obtained an examination of the worker by a physician of its choice and then sought to obtain another opinion because the physician announced his impending retirement, the trial court correctly denied the request because the doctor didn‚Äôt state he would be unavailable but rather if he were going to see her, it would need to be before he retired, and the employer still had a reasonable opportunity to depose its physician or obtain his opinions in another admissible form. Clearly, these motions are fact-intensive.
In Caldwell v. Fed‚Äôl Mogul Motorsports, the Board considered the Workers‚Äô Compensation Law‚Äôs provision that allows the employee to have his own physician present at an employer‚Äôs examination and Rule 35, concluding that ‚Äúpresent‚Äù doesn‚Äôt mean the employee‚Äôs physician may attend electronically but must be physically present.
As for recovering an IME‚Äôs expense, in Garrasino v. W. Express, Inc., the Appeals Board held that an IME physician‚Äôs bill for reviewing medical records and performing a physical examination are not recoverable as discretionary costs under Rule 54.04. The employee appealed to the Supreme Court Panel, which affirmed the Board.
Post-Judgment Motions
Johnson v. Pilgrim‚Äôs Pride came before the Appeals Board twice. The first time, the Board differentiated the rules on post-judgment motions, Rules 59 and 60. The former asks a court to alter or amend a judgment, while the latter gives specific reasons that a court may relieve a party from a final judgment, such as mistake, inadvertence, surprise, excusable neglect, fraud or ‚Äúany other reason justifying relief.‚Äù In the case, the pro se employee sought to set aside a settlement agreement, arguing that she was under ‚Äústress‚Äù and ‚Äúduress‚Äù at the time. The trial court declined her motion, and the Board affirmed.
The second time around, the Board issued a memorandum opinion outlining the principles of res judicata, a/k/a claim preclusion. The outcome was no different for the injured worker.
Back to Rule 59 motions to alter or amend. In Watson v. Labor Smart, Inc., the Appeals Board held that the trial court retains jurisdiction to resolve a timely-filed motion to alter or amend and that a notice of appeal filed before the filing of the motion, or before the trial court‚Äôs disposition of this type of motion, will be considered filed on the day the trial court files its order resolving the motion. The Board additionally reminded that it‚Äôs not bound by the Rules of Appellate Procedure, but they find them ‚Äúinstructive.‚Äù
Finally, a word about Rule 11 sanctions and frivolous appeals. In Thompson v. Comcast, the Board held that a frivolous appeal has ‚Äúno realistic chance of success.‚Äù The Board may award attorneys‚Äô fees and costs for frivolous appeals under its rules, but it has no authority to order sanctions under Rule 11 of the Tennessee Rules of Civil Procedure, which ‚Äúdoes not apply to the appellate court[s].‚Äù But the rule does apply, and has been applied, at the trial court level.
Sometimes you just have to roll up your sleeves and do it.
In sum, these last two blog posts have discussed briefly just a smattering of the cases where the appellate courts interpreted the Rules of Civil Procedure in workers‚Äô comp cases since the Reform Act took effect. It‚Äôs entirely possible that these articles didn‚Äôt touch on an opinion that might make the difference in your next case. So please, do your research, and stay current. Thanks in advance for your fine advocacy.
One thought on ‚ÄúLearning the rules of ‚Äòritualized battle,‚Äô part two‚Äù
Very helpful as always Jane! I don‚Äôt know that I agree with what I took as implicit approval of the elimination of the notice of withdrawal of a PBD signed off on by mediators but my feeling is that was a mistake from a practical point of view to now require filing an order of dismissal in the WC court under Rule 41.

- Efforts to provide greater convenience for travelers as states begin to open.
With over 95% of Malaysia‚Äôs adult population being fully vaccinated, movement restrictions have begun to ease as more Malaysians are getting back to their everyday routines and travelling. With this, various sectors which are reopening have also put in place high safety standards to give people the confidence to embrace this new normal.
As Malaysians adapt to the idea of travelling in the new normal, Grab has seen an increase in demand for rides. Therefore, Grab is sharing an updated 6-step guide to safer rides with GrabProtect which are based on the various efforts introduced to ensure safety for both users as well as our partners.
Elaborating on this, Rashid Shukor, Head of Operations at Grab Malaysia adds, ‚ÄúMalaysians are getting back to their daily routines and we have observed more people are out and taking rides more frequently. As a platform that aims to provide convenient and safe transport options, we have put in place our GrabProtect policy to protect the health and safety of our users . Through this we hope to give greater peace of mind to our community as the public continue to embrace this new normal and our driver-partners continue to earn via the platform.
Commitment to health and safety for greater peace of mind
GrabProtect is an initiative that helps reinforce higher safety and hygiene standards on our platform. We are focused on getting you to your destination efficiently and as safely as possible.
The health and safety measures in the GrabProtect 6 steps to safer rides include:
- Health declaration form ‚Äì All driver- and delivery-partners, as well as passengers are required to complete their health declaration before they can start driving, delivery orders or book a ride. Drivers will be required to complete the online health and hygiene declaration at least once a day, whereas passengers will be required to do so before every ride booking.
- Mandatory face mask ‚Äì Grab driver- and delivery-partners are required to wear a mask whenever they are on the Grab platform and the same requirement will be extended to passengers. If either party shows up without a mask on, passengers and driver-partners can cancel the booking by selecting ‚Äúdriver/passenger did not wear a mask‚Äù as their cancellation reason.
- In-car sanitisation ‚Äì Grab has ensured that driver and delivery-partners are equipped with masks and hygiene kits to protect their vehicles and delivery bags. Car and delivery bag disinfection services will also be made available, at a subsidised fee, to Grab drivers- and delivery-partners at selected locations.
- Trip Monitoring ‚Äì To ensure the safety of both driver-partners as well as passengers, Grab uses various signals to detect anomalies during a ride. This includes monitoring trip signals such as GPS, traffic conditions and map intelligence. Details will be shared with the authorities if the safety of passengers or driver-partners are at risk.
- Emergency Button ‚Äì Provides a one-stop tap to get immediate assistance, 24/7, 365 days a year. Given your response, police or ambulance units will be dispatched. Passengers can also add and enable Emergency Contacts from the settings icon who will be automatically alerted if they tap on the emergency button.
- Share My Ride ‚Äì This feature allows passengers to share their ride details with loved ones via a shareable link. Tapping on the link will then open a web page where the ride details can be tracked

IoD Pride in Business co-chair Garry Bernstein welcomed over 160 LGBTQ+ business leaders and allies to the IoD‚Äôs Carlton Room at 116 Pall Mall, gathered with the aim of empowering, encouraging, and supporting one another in business endeavours.
Guests also heard from IoD Managing Director of Professional Development Louise Gulliver, who espoused the IoD‚Äôs stance on workplace equality and its duty, as decreed by the Royal Charter, to support business leaders. "There is a still a long way to go," she told the audience.
"Over a quarter of lesbian, gay and bisexual workers responding to research by the organisation Stonewall, say they are not open to colleagues about their sexual orientation. Our goal here at the IoD is to make business fully inclusive, diversity of thought leads to better decisions and better decisions to better business."
House Speaker Mr Bercow regaled the audience with his personal insights into equality in government and politics, along with some wider predictions about the future progression of LGBTQ+ rights in the workplace and beyond.
‚ÄúYou can‚Äôt dodge these issues; ducking is not an option. Don‚Äôt let prejudice lurk or dance around unchallenged. Tackle it at every turn!‚Äù
Following Mr Bercow‚Äôs remarks, there was then a short Q&A session, where audience questions ranged from encouraging straight allies, and gender equality, to LGBTQ+ efforts and support around the world.
The speaker session was brought to a close by another Pride in Business co-chair Zoe Chowney sharing her own personal story, before commencing the networking drinks.
Keep an eye out for news of our next Pride in Business event, and get involved with the online conversation at @The_IoD or using the #IoDPride hashtag.New tertiary education students wishing to have one year of free education are being encouraged to apply by December 16.
The Government is fast-tracking its tertiary education campaign promises, with the Cabinet now in the detailed planning stage to introduce one year of free tertiary education for new students, and a $50 weekly boost to the student allowance as well as a $50 weekly boost in student loans for living costs.
Education Minister Chris Hipkins said the policies will come into force by January 1 next year.
"Prospective students and tertiary education organisations should continue to make arrangements for study and enrolments for next year as they normally would. This includes starting, or continuing, any applications for study and/or for student loans or allowances," Hipkins said.
AdvertisementAdvertise with NZME.
"StudyLink is encouraging prospective students to apply by 16 December and to provide their supporting documents promptly to ensure their applications are sorted for the start of the 2018 academic year."
The fees-free policy will apply to new university students, as well as apprenticeships, industry training and polytechnic students - anyone who has not previously studied at tertiary level.
The policy will be extended to two years free in 2021, and three years free in 2024 - or more rapidly, if conditions permit. The extra student support is expected to cost an additional $270m a year, and the first year of free tertiary education will cost $340 million.
"Students, schools and tertiary providers are understandably keen to know full details," Hipkins said.
"We will make sure they get the information they need in a timely way. In the meantime they can rest assured that the first year of fees free study will kick in next year and should plan accordingly."Latest True Fact-checks on Dave Brat Dave Brat stated on May 24, 2016 in Facebook post.: "The labor force participation rate -- the share of the potential workforce that is actually working or looking for work-- currently stands below 63%, the lowest level since the 1970s."

Officers have released CCTV images of two suspects seen battering the window of Goldbox jewellers at 60 South Road with a hammer at 5pm on Monday (July 15).
Two men, wearing dark clothing and balaclavas, pulled out outside the shop in a black BMW 1 Series convertible.
One armed with a heavy club hammer attacked the front window and, after repeated attempts, succeeded in smashing it. His accomplice then reached through and grabbed a selection of gold necklace and earring sets worth around ¬£2,000 from the display.
They then jumped back into the car, which had been double-parked on South Road while the robbery took place.
The vehicle fled north along South Road, across the junction of Broadway and then at speed up Lady Margaret Road. It is believed a third suspect was driving the car.
Detective Constable Johnny Baker, from the Flying Squad at Finchley, said: "This was an audacious well-planned raid in broad daylight on a busy street and we are need the public‚Äôs help to arrest those responsible.
"Were you there at the time? Did you see the getaway car double-parked - did you see its registration plate or the person waiting inside? If you have any information please come forward."
Anyone who can help is asked to please contact the Flying Squad on 020 8358 1751 or Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111.The Lost Vape UB Lite Coils are replacement coils for the Ursa Mini Replcement Pod that comes with the Lost Vape Ursa Mini Pod Kit.

Oasis Spa & Salon ManagerPillow of Air: Las Meninas/Dutch Still Life
Lawrence Weschler.
For one thing, if that silvered rectangle behind and to the painter‚Äôs left in fact contains, as it appears to, a mirrored reflection of the king and queen, then maybe we are being invited to inhabit their point of view as they stand for their own portrait, with the rest of the courtly retinue gazing upon them (maybe the mirror is reflecting not them so much as the big painting of them the painter is in the midst of conjuring into being as he gazes upon them); or maybe it‚Äôs just that the royal couple happens to have happened upon the court painter busily in the act of rendering a group portrait of their daughter, the Infanta, flanked by her variously attentive retinue, hence their reflection in the distant mirror and the painter‚Äôs momentarily having been pulled out from behind his canvas to acknowledge their presence. Or maybe everybody in the painting is looking at a huge painting of the royal couple, leaning against the wall behind where we as viewers would be standing, and that‚Äôs what‚Äôs being reflected in the distant mirror.
But, looking more closely, none of those can be quite right. For one thing, the reflective optics don‚Äôt quite align; indeed, maybe that silvered rectangle in the background isn‚Äôt even a mirror at all but rather an earlier painting of the royal couple. (I mean, obviously it is a painting of the royal couple, a localized slather of pigmented muds spread over a portion of the wider canvas, but whether it‚Äôs meant also to represent a painting within the painting is a different question.) The fiction of the painting further seems to imply that, like the photographer, what the painter is looking into is a mirrored reflection of the scene before him, which he is in the process of rendering onto that huge canvas angled over to our left side of the painting, a canvas that, come to think of it, would in that case be the very painting we are now looking at.
But hang on, nor can that be right. Because that‚Äôs not how painting works. One of the important ways in which painting is different from chemical photography‚Äîwhich, remember, didn‚Äôt exist during Vel√°zquez‚Äôs time, even notionally‚Äîis that painting is precisely not the world apprehended in an instantaneous blink. As he painted Las Meninas, Vel√°zquez would have been standing more or less where we as viewers now stand (as we look at his painting), and, more to the point, the scene before us would at no moment have been a scene before him. Rather, during the months and months of the painting‚Äôs composition, Vel√°zquez might have spent a few days working on the dog, and then another few days laying in the kid to the dog‚Äôs side, the boy teasing the endlessly put-upon dog with that little kick (and during those days, the kid would doubtless have been leaning on some sort of footstool and not onto the dog‚Äôs flank; if nothing else, the actual dog would not actually have sat endlessly still for such tomfoolery). A whole other sequence of days would have been given over to portraying the Infanta‚Äôs dwarf, and I doubt the Infanta would have stood still for that. And so forth. Furthermore, anyone viewing the finished picture would have known that that‚Äôs how it was made, and hence known how to read it: as a composition unfurling across time. It‚Äôs only we, living in the wake of the invention and subsequent rampant spread of photography, who are saddled with the fantasy of the immediate, the very fantasy incarnated in that pastiche department-store ad.
I‚Äôm hardly the first person to have become entrammeled by the enigmatic vantages embodied in Vel√°zquez‚Äôs masterpiece.
Consider, for example, Foucault‚Äôs famous treatment of some of these same perplexities near the out-set of his 1966 Les mots et les choses, subsequently translated as The Order of Things‚Äîhow he locates in Vel√°zquez‚Äôs confounding image the very moment when the classical gaze (with its simple-hearted representation of ‚Äúa window upon the world‚Äù) starts to question itself, everything becoming riddled with doubts and second thoughts, nothing anymore to be taken for granted: the upsurge, in short, of the modern.
Or, more recently, British-born American artist Eve Sussman‚Äôs marvelous 2004 art-film fantasy, the beautifully flowing single-take ten-minute repeating loop enigmatically entitled 89 Seconds at Alc√°zar, in which elaborately costumed, vaguely (naggingly) familiar seventeenth-century-style courtiers and hangers-oncaper and flit about a large, gloomy, hangerlike space‚Äîchildren and a dog, an elegant painter and the clownish dwarf (and, wait a second, damn if that isn‚Äôt Peter Dinklage avant le
Lannister!), nuns and nursemaids and royals‚Äîuntil suddenly the whole thing snaps momentarily into place as that very Meninas image, and already everything is coming all undone, the dog plodding away, the children chasing after the dog, the nursemaids chasing after the children‚Äîlike herding cats, we find our-selves thinking‚Äîall of which combine to suggest‚Ä¶ what, exactly?
That that‚Äôs how it must have been, Vel√°zquez just happening to have glimpsed that brief fleet-flitting decisive moment as the inspiration for his entire canvas, how thank goodness he had a Polaroid camera at the ready, tucked away in the ruffles of his cape, such that this, too, couldn‚Äôt have been at all like what actually happened.
See what I mean about the vertiginous opportunities for reflection, and reflections upon reflection, afforded by pastiche?
The same sort of reflections, at any rate, arise out of a consideration of contemporary photographer David LaChappelle‚Äôs recent pastiche tribute to seventeenth-century Dutch floral paintings. (Almost impossible to tell them apart, except note the gleaming cordless phones at the bottom of LaChappelle‚Äôs rendering.)
Now, LaChappelle had to gather flowers at various stages of decomposition, all of them bunched together and appropriately ruffled and bedewed with studious precision, all of them laid out just so, and now wait a minute, just one more adjustment‚ÄîOK, there, right: now!‚Äîfor his instantaneous photo shot. That is, unless‚Äîas nowadays is becoming more and more often the case‚Äîhe Photoshopped the final image, layering in one flower one day and another the next, in which case he would have been engaged in an activity much closer to that of his seventeenth-century predecessor. (David Hockney has lately been commenting on the fact that, what with the rampant recent spread of Photoshop, for the first time since 1839 the hand of the photographer is reentering the frame and the often quite gaping 150-year divide separating painting and photography is thus rapidly beginning to close back up.)
The point at any rate is that during the seventeenth century, painters never actually attempted to portray fully brimming floral arrangements along the lines of the one ultimately offered forth in their finished painting (such an actual bouquet would long have wilted to compost before they could have finished their painting).Rather, like Vel√°zquez, they slowly built up their burgeoning still lifes one blossom, one bulb, one branch at a time, all the while layering in ever-deeper significations (all those creepy crawlers and flitting flyers, for more on which see Harry Berger Jr.‚Äôs revelatory 2012 monograph,
Caterpillage: ReÔ¨Çections on Seventeenth-Century Dutch Still Life Painting, wherein the good professor suggests that contrary to their placid pastoral reputations, such paintings may afford some of the most violently roiling depictions and occasions for meditation on such mortal violence that any visitor nowadays is likely to encounter during his museum walk).
So I‚Äôm glad we sorted all of that out. On the other hand, when I happened to be lecturing on some of this stuff at the Spencer Museum of Art, at the University of Kansas in Lawrence, a few weeks back, Stephen Goddard, one of my hosts and the museum‚Äôs keeper of works on paper, turned unusually drop-jawed as I projected a slide of LaChappelle‚Äôs 2012 still life with cordless phones. Talk about pillows of air! I mean, I know it‚Äôs an uncanny image and all, but it‚Äôs not that uncanny. Afterward, how-ever, Goddard, an amateur photographer himself, pulled me aside and escorted me to his back office, where, revving up his computer, he proceeded to draw up an image of his own, a still life he himself had contrived back in 2008: He told me he had never publicly shown it. And, really, I don‚Äôt know what the hell to make of that.Connect to: Library Web Site‚ùå Online Catalog

I‚Äôve been a pet sitter for quite some time now. However, it wasn‚Äôt until this summer when I watched my friends‚Äô pooch in Chicago for a few months that I got a taste of long-term pet sitting. Not only did I get the chance to enjoy living in another city while freelancing, I lived rent-free. It made me wonder: How can one turn pro?
House- or pet-sitting has obvious appeal. Over 12 million households spend 50 percent or more of their income on housing. House- or pet-sitting can allow you to rent your own home out while you work, allowing you to lower your costs. If you‚Äôre someone who doesn't get terribly homesick or has few things to tie you to a specific location, it could be a way to see the world on a budget. While it seems pretty awesome, there are practicalities to keep in mind. Plus it can be pretty competitive to land a gig.
I reached out to a full-time sitter to find out how to go about landing a sitting assignment as well as what to consider when looking for jobs.
‚ÄúThere are all kinds of different scenarios for people who house-sit,‚Äù said Kelly Hayes-Raitt, author of the book "How to Become a Housesitter: Insider Tips from the HouseSit Diva." ‚ÄúBut if you‚Äôre going to be a full-time nomad, a drag is that you're always planning, so you know where you're going to be by next summer.‚Äù Hayes-Raitt, whose house- and pet-sitting allows her to rent out her home in California, tries to plan her gigs as far out as possible. She currently has an annual six-month gig in Mexico every year, and plans to house-sit in Paris early next year.
You can hunt for gigs on sites such as Nomador, Workaway, and TrustedHousesitters. While TrustedHousesitters is the most popular house-sitting site, it‚Äôs also the most competitive, said Hayes-Raitt, who has been a full time house- and pet-sitter for nine years. You can also do a search for all opportunities on the aggregate site HouseSitSearch.
Because house- and pet-sitting can be competitive, you need to get your foot in the door in one of a few ways. You can pet-sit as a favor for a friend or take up dog walking as a side hustle. If you can, meet up with potential hosts and pets and see their homes in person. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre more likely to land the sitting assignment if the homeowners have had the opportunity to meet you face-to-face,‚Äù said Hayes-Raitt.
Besides travel costs, you‚Äôll also want to factor in the costs of food, transport, and other living expenses. If you‚Äôre traveling internationally, you‚Äôll need a passport, travel health insurance and possibly a visa. When I dog-sat for my friends, my friend paid for a one-way ticket to Chicago and set me up with a bike to get around. I only needed to take care of my own public transit and food.
To save money on travel, figure out what the low travel seasons are for places where you would like to house-sit and base your plans on that. You can also house-sit in locales that are close to one another to save, as regional airlines offer lower airfare or you can travel by bus or train.
To make your dollar go further, you can seek house-sitting opportunities in countries where the dollar is strong since you'll have more buying power. ‚ÄúIf you house-sit in a country where the dollar is very strong, it‚Äôll be an affordable house-sit stint for you,‚Äù said Hayes-Raitt.
While living in total seclusion in pastoral France sounds amazing, would you really be cool with, say, drawing water from a well? Know which creature comforts you need, said Hayes-Raitt.
‚ÄúIt‚Äôs important to know what kind of experience you want to have when you‚Äôre house sitting,‚Äù said Hayes-Raitt.
Figure out whether you want to be amid the bustle of city life, or a quiet retreat nestled in the middle of nowhere. You‚Äôll also need to figure out if you want a lengthier house-sitting gig in another country or a weekend getaway.
If you‚Äôre pet-sitting, besides the obvious limits, such as whether you‚Äôre allergic to certain animals, decide whether there are any types of pets you aren‚Äôt comfortable watching. Would you be cool working with animals on a farm? Or as a caretaker of snakes? Knowing your limits ahead of time serves the interests of both you and your clients.
Besides talking to prospective clients on what your responsibilities will entail, and whether you‚Äôll get paid or just a place to stay rent-free, find out if there are any other expectations. For instance, will you be responsible for helping them handle paying any bills? Light housework? Or might they expect you to chip in for utilities? To avoid being blindsided, don‚Äôt assume your hosts will pay all housing-related expenses.
Sure, you‚Äôre in a new locale, itching to explore your new environs, but it‚Äôs important to agree to a house-sitting gig knowing it‚Äôs a job. ‚ÄúHouse-sitting opens people up to possibilities,‚Äù said Hayes-Raitt. ‚ÄúIt's a way to travel the world for free or really cheap. But it‚Äôs also a responsibility to take care of someone's house and pet. If you have theater tickets and the pet is sick, you need to take it to the vet. Or the pipe bursts, you handle it.‚Äù
I experienced this firsthand when I was dog-sitting. I missed out on a daylong pig roast and had to schedule any weekend travel when I was done with my gig.
You‚Äôre also subject to other people‚Äôs schedules, when they need you to stay at their place and daily tasks that need to be done.
While house-sitting to travel or save on your housing costs seems great, you‚Äôll want to keep in mind practical considerations. Doing so will ensure you find gigs you‚Äôre well-suited for and won‚Äôt be blindsided by unexpected scenarios.

Victor Payan and Sandra Pe√±a-Sarmiento (aka Pocha Pe√±a), the dynamic duo behind ‚ÄúAztec Gold with Lou Chalibre,‚Äù are expanding the lexicon with crudos ‚Äî wrestlers nursing hangovers after a night on the town. A crudo ‚Äúis very wild, beyond rudo,‚Äù Payan jokingly explains.
Audiences can enjoy the antics of rudos, crudos, t√©cnicos and gender-bending exoticos at Aztec Gold's ‚ÄúRudos y Tecnicos: A Lucharrific San Antonio Extravaganza.‚Äù Described as a ‚Äúcultural smackdown,‚Äù the event Saturday at Gallista Gallery will feature performances by artists including Marisela Barrera, David Zamora Casas and Cruz Ortiz, an exhibit of lucha-themed artwork, a live luchanovela, a holiday luchamercado and a series of bouts. Though the event promises kitschy-good fun, artists and performers will also grapple with serious issues such as immigration and the Dream Act ‚Äúthrough the lens of humor and lucha,‚Äù Payan says.Senate President pro Tempore Toni G. Atkins (D-San Diego), along with Senate Budget Chair Nancy Skinner (D-Berkeley) and Senate Budget Subcommittee Chairs Anna M. Caballero (D-Salinas), Mar√≠a Elena Durazo (D-Los Angeles), Susan Talamantes Eggman (D-Stockton), John Laird (D-Santa Cruz), and Bob Wieckowski (D-Fremont), have announced the Senate‚Äôs budget proposal to build a post-pandemic economy that extends prosperity for Californians and invests resources to address the state‚Äôs most pressing needs in innovative and equitable ways.
‚ÄúThe Senate‚Äôs ‚ÄòBuild Back Boldly‚Äô budget gives us a once-in-a-generation chance to make transformational change in California,‚Äù Pro Tem Atkins said. ‚ÄúCalifornia has long led the nation on things like expanding health care for the middle class and undocumented immigrants, providing paid family leave and a higher minimum income, and establishing our own Earned Income Tax Credit. With the Build Back Boldly budget, the Senate continues to prioritize smart investments that take care of Californians and take California into the future.‚Äù
The Senate‚Äôs ‚ÄòBuild Back Boldly‚Äô proposal includes eight transformative proposals:
‚Ä¢ Help small business and non-profits bounce back;
‚Ä¢ Create a path to universal 0-3 child care and education;
‚Ä¢ Make debt-free college a reality;
‚Ä¢ Address homelessness, housing affordability and home ownership;
‚Ä¢ Expand access and affordability of health care;
‚Ä¢ Invest in wildfire prevention and resilience;
‚Ä¢ Mitigate the impacts of drought;
‚Ä¢ Improve state systems.
The proposal also includes key subcommittee packages to address K-12 and higher education, public libraries, greenhouse gas and pollution reduction, safety net and aging and public health, equitable recovery, workforce investments, access to legal service resources, and justice reform.
During a press conference, Senate Budget Chair Skinner said the Senate‚Äôs budget proposal would provide financial help for California‚Äôs businesses and families, including those most vulnerable.
‚ÄúThe California Senate‚Äôs Build Back Boldly budget captures this moment when millions of Californians are reeling from pandemic economic hardship at the same time the stock market has soared and given California unprecedented revenues,‚Äù Sen. Skinner said. ‚ÄúOur plan provides immediate economic relief to families and small businesses while taking bold steps to close the wealth inequity that undermines California‚Äôs prosperity for all.‚Äù
Senate Budget Subcommittee 3 (Health and Human Services) Chair Susan Talamantes Eggman (D-Stockton) said: ‚ÄúThe Senate budget package strengthens our safety net, expands access to services for seniors, and prioritizes investments in a robust public health infrastructure. These investments are critical to seeing California through the latter stages of the pandemic, addressing inequality, and to help support a strong economic recovery.‚ÄùThe priority is to keep schools and early learning and childcare services open and minimise disruption in the work force.

U.S. President Donald Trump has suggested the establishment of a U.S. national television station to counter what he termed ‚Äúthe unfair and false way‚Äù CNN is portraying the country.
Trump, in a tweet, alleged that CNN was not doing great in the U.S. but acknowledged the network ‚Äúhas very little competition‚Äù outside the country.
Trump wrote: !‚Äù
Trump had in 2017 threatened to shut down NBC and other American networks, saying they peddled fake news.
‚ÄúWith all of the Fake News coming out of NBC and the Networks, at what point is it appropriate to challenge their License? Bad for country!‚Äù Trump said.
There had been no love lost between CNN and Trump since the ascension to presidency, and the president had constantly pushed back against the network, which he had dubbed ‚ÄúFake News‚Äù.
However, the strain relationship between CNN, which had become Trump‚Äôs ardent critic over his policies, had become worse following the midterm election, which Republicans lost the House to the Democrats.
The White House had revoked the press badge of CNN‚Äôs Chief White House Correspondent, Jim Acosta, following heated exchange with President Donald Trump at a press conference on the midterm election.
White House Press Secretary, Sarah Sanders, announced that the decision was a result of Acosta‚Äôs behaviour, for yanking back when a White House intern tried to take his microphone.
CNN, however, sued the Trump‚Äôs administration, asking the court for an immediate restraining order requiring the pass to be returned to Acosta.
A Federal Judge, Timothy Kelly, ruled in favour of CNN, granting the network‚Äôs motion for a temporary restraining order, and ordering the White House to temporarily restore the press credentials of the reporter.
Consequent upon the court order, White House restored Acosta‚Äôs press pass, writing in a letter to the reporter that it made a ‚Äúfinal determination‚Äù to give him back his badge.

As compared with other ancient Near Eastern texts, in which demons play a central role, the Bible is nearly silent about the existence of supernatural beings. But not the Talmud. The Talmud has a rich, though vague, demonology. Houses of study are described as being filled with demons when sexual energy is not properly channeled. Great rabbis are able to perceive demons sitting on the right and left hands of every person. They are able to harness the divine creative energies to create animals which can then be consumed for food. And, in the talmudic world, spirits are everywhere: They haunt dark places, homes, even the crumbs left on the dinner table. For example, consider the omnipresence and omnimalevolence of demons described in theTalmud in Berakhot 6a:
‚ÄúIt has been taught: Abba Benjamin says, If the eye had the power to see them, no creature could endure the demons. Abaye says: They are more numerous than we are and they surround us like the ridge around a field. R. Huna says: Every one among us has a thousand on his left hand and ten thousand on his right hand. Raba says: The crushing of the crowd in the Kallah [yearly public]‚Äù in their work or sexual life? As in the source above,‚Äùdemons‚Äù (mazikim, a word which might be better translated ‚Äúharmful beings‚Äù) could be seen as anything that causes decay, pain, and the depletion of life-energy.
But there‚Äôs reason to think that the text in Berakhot is not referring to metaphorical demons, as it goes on to say, ‚ÄúIf one wants to discover them, let him take sifted ashes and sprinkle around his bed, and in the morning he will see something like the footprints of a cock.‚Äù
Unlike the Talmud, kabbalistic demonology is more detailed. Some demons are formed whenever a man improperly spills his seed‚Äìa sin considered so heinous by the Kabbalah because it subverts the creative process. Other demons are, as in the Christian myth, rebellious angels, or in the case of Lilith, primordial humans.
The mythic narratives of the Kabbalah may be difficult for us to understand today, but not if we situate them within the deep concerns‚Äìparticularly those related to conception and childbirth‚Äìof the kabbalists and ordinary Jews who lived in a time of great uncertainty. Just as bearing children was central to one‚Äôs identity, it was also rife with peril. Miscarriage, infant mortality, illness, and birth defects were all far more common in the medieval world than they are today. Bearing children was awesome and terrifying. recently..Sound engineer

As the technology goes an alteration or change, the demands of the people changes.
Similar is the situation with the digital world of the market as because the mass people demand to see some sort of improved Visual Effects and Graphics in the recent digital realm of digitalization.
In order to meet these demands what we require is master experts of Adobe Photoshop which can easily be educated in the present day with the assistance of the Adobe Photoshop.
Adobe Photoshop has for quite some time been viewed as fundamental programming for visual computerization.
It is sold alone or as a feature of Adobe‚Äôs Creative Suite (or Creative Cloud), which could likewise incorporate Illustrator, InDesign, Flash, Dreamweaver, Acrobat Pro, Lightroom and a few different devices.
Photoshop‚Äôs essential capacities incorporate photograph altering, web architecture, and the production of components for an undertaking.
It is additionally normally used to make formats for the plan, for example, blurbs and business cards, despite the fact that Illustrator or InDesign are regularly better for those assignments.
Photograph Editing
Photoshop, the name is so called for a reason.
Adobe Photoshop is considered as an excellent instrument for the editing of photographs.
Assuming that a designer is setting up a computerized digital or scanned photo for use in an undertaking, regardless of whether it is a site, handout, and book outline or bundling, the initial step is regularly to bring it into Photoshop.
Utilizing an assortment of devices inside the software, a designer can crop and yield photographs adjust and manage the proper sizes and colours of the photos, touch-up photographs.
For example, ‚Äúdeleting‚Äù a flaw or expelling a tear or overlap, effectively modify photographs, apply an extensive choice of channels, for example, ‚Äúwatercolor‚Äù for embellishments and styles and many more.
The above photograph is edited by one of our precious students of MAAC Chowringhee during the sessions of Adobe Photoshop.
Through this you may have got an idea about the effectiveness and efficiency of the courses and training at MAAC Kolkata.
Adobe Photoshop is also utilized by the designers to advance and optimize photographs for the web by picking document arrangements and decreasing record measure.
Modify and in addition, save photos in an assortment of configurations for use in print ventures, utilize their innovativeness to perform endless errands, web design and so on.
Web Design and Adobe Photoshop
Photoshop is the favoured apparatus for some website specialists.
While it is fit for sending out HTML, it is frequently not used to code sites, yet rather to plan them before proceeding onward to the coding stage.
Photoshop is basic, in the sense, to first outline a level, non-working site in Photoshop, and after that take that plan and make a working site utilizing Dreamweaver, a CSS editorial manager, by hand coding, or utilizing an assortment of programming alternatives
This is on the grounds that it is anything but difficult to drag components around the page, modify hues and include components without investing energy composing code that may simply need to change later.
Web designers have the capability to design and create the entire formats of a web in Adobe Photoshop that comprises of optimizing Graphics for utilization on the web design singular components, for example, catches or foundations.
The above piece of photograph is designed by our students at MAAC Chowringhee centre of MAAC Kolkata as an effective specimen of Adobe Photoshop.
Creation of Project Layout
Software such as InDesign and Illustrator is regarded s idyllic for the purpose of desktop and project layout.
But the fact is Photoshop is more than adequate for doing this sort of work.
Among the Adobe Systems, the Adobe Creative Suite is a costly package and as a result, many designers stay with Photoshop to execute their works.
Tasks, for example, business cards, blurbs, postcards, and flyers can be finished utilizing Photoshop‚Äôs compose apparatuses and illustrations altering capacities.
Numerous print shops will acknowledge Photoshop records or if nothing else a PDF, which can be sent out of the product.
Bigger ventures, for example, books or multi-page leaflets ought to be done in different projects.
Photoshop in Animation
Adobe Photoshop is effectively utilized in the Animation industry.
It is used to for the function of the storyboards, but they are occasionally done by hands.

The train first began chugging around City Park in May 2011, replacing an older model shut down in 2005 over safety concerns. But it has broken down five times since then in different locations.
On several occasions, the rear wheel truck of the coach car came off the track, Deputy City Manager Brannon Godfrey told the City Council in June. The train closed weeks after it opened last year and ran only a few days this year, according to city records.
The fix, Godfrey told the council, is to replace the entire track.
The three-quarter-mile track is made of donated 90-pound rail - a type used by full-size trains.
However, Pokey Smokey II is a standard model train designed for a 20-pound rail, according to documents obtained by The Pilot. Rail sizes are measured by the weight per yard.
The new track will be made of 20-pound rail.
The council approved money for the project in June. About $45,000 will come from the general operating budget and $80,000 from the capital improvement fund. The city spent almost $30,000 previously to make other repairs to the track.
According to documents from October 2010, the purchase agreement between the Southeast Virginia Community Foundation, which raised funds for the train, and Chance Morgan, the manufacturer, do not mention that the train must fit a particular rail type. It lists only the C.P. Huntington locomotive and its coach for a purchase price of $215,970.
The track installation guide provided to the foundation a month later by Chance Morgan states: "The C.P. Huntington will operate on 12-, 16- or 20-lb rail. However, it is recommended that 20-lb. rail be used whenever possible."
City leaders said they believe the train doesn't fit because the track is old.
Regardless, Godfrey and former foundation director Judi Luffman said it was their understanding that all three parties had conversations and thought the train would fit.
Latest News
Luffman said she was surprised and befuddled to learn that the train didn't fit the tracks. She rode on it several times when it opened on May 14, 2011, and said it felt fine.
Jeff Roth, vice president for administration for the manufacturer, said that any sales associate would have known to mention the rail size that the miniature train needs.
The C.P. Huntington train is not a custom design, Roth said. Pokey Smokey II is the 365th model the company has built and is the same model that is in use at the Virginia Zoo in Norfolk.
Pokey Smokey II was supposed to be a gift to Portsmouth, a reminder of its namesake, which had chugged its way into the hearts of locals over several decades. City leaders had thought it would be easier and more cost effective to replace the original Pokey Smokey than to repair it.

March 17, 2020The homemade grape juice recipe is a healthy option. And you can easily make juice from grapes after reading this recipe guide. We have explained here the two best ways to prepare grape juice.
But before going through the whole recipe guide, let me explain what types of nutrients grape juice contains.
Grapes juice is rich in vitamin C, antioxidants, potassium, calcium, magnesium, and phosphorus, and lower in calories, fat, sugar, protein, and carbohydrate.
How to make grape juice at home without using a blender or juicer?
You can make grape juice at home without using a juicer or blender in an easy and effective way. But, you will need the following things at your disposal:
ingredients:
1. 2 cups of Concord grapes
2. Sugar (if you like sweetened juice)
3. Strainer (THE BEST STRAINER ON AMAZON)
4. Large stainless steel bowl (CHECK THE BEST ONE HERE)
5. Cheesecloth (BUY FROM AMAZON)
6. Bowl (THE BEST BOWL SET)
Steps to follow making homemade grape juice recipe:
1. Reap the grapes:
We prefer concord grapes most to juice when it comes to having a nutritious drink. In fact, concord grapes are the most popular and nutritious grape variety in the world. But, you can choose different types of grapes to make juice.
If you have grapes vine in your backyard garden, it is better to harvest them fresh to make juice. Otherwise, you can collect garden-fresh grapes from a local farmer or you can buy from the local vendor but fresh grapes are preferable.
2. Remove them from the stem:
Remove the grapes one by one from the grape stem and gather them in a pot. Make sure to throw away the spoiled grapes.
3. Wash the grapes properly:
Grape may contain pesticides or insects and you should carefully wash them. You might wash them using warm water for a couple of minutes removing pesticides or any chemical or keep them under water in a bowl for 5-10 minutes.
4. Mash up them:
Mash them up using a potato masher until the fluid begins to flow in the stainless steel bowl.
5. Cook them well:
Place the bowl of the mashed grapes on a stove and heat them mildly and cook them for up to 10-15 minutes. In the meantime, when the grapes boil, you have to mash them up using a stainless steel spoon.
6. Strain the boiled grapes:
Keep a strainer or Cheesecloth on a bowl or a container, pour the strainer or Cheesecloth with the boiled grapes and stain them properly until the maximum juice comes out.
7. Adding sugar:
Some grapes juice naturally becomes less sweeten. If you like to have a sweet grapes juice recipe, you can add some sugar to the juice as your taste and cook them again to dissolve the sugar fully.
8. Cool the juice:
Now, cool the strained juice in a refrigerator or add some ice cubes to the juice and enjoy the juice.
How to make juice from grapes with a blender or juicer?
You can also make juice from grapes using the best blender or a fast juicer like Jack Lalanne power juicer express.
Equipments:
- Stainless steel cooking pot (SEE ON AMAZON)
- Strainer or Colander
- Cheesecloth
- Masher (SEE ON AMAZON)
- Jar or bowl
- Juicer or blender
Ingredients:
- 2 Cups Concord grapes
- 1 Cup water
- Sugar (optional)
- 3-4 Ice cubes
Instructions:
1. Collect the garden-fresh concord grapes from your garden or from local farmers.
2. Destem the grapes one by one and sort out the damaged grapes and throw them away.
3. Wash them thoroughly to remove pesticides, chemicals, or insects. You can rinse them in running water for better cleaning.
4. Now, toss the grapes in the blender or slow juicer to extract the highest juice possible. Add some water for effective blending.
5. After extracting them well, use a strainer or cheesecloth to get more clean grape juice straining leftover pulp in the juice.
6. Then, Add some sugar if you want to sweeten the grape juice recipe. Otherwise, you should not add sugar while you want to have a low-sugar drink.
7. At last, put some ice cubes in the juice to get a better taste and flavor and enjoy the cold juice.
Notes
You can use any type of grapes and add sugar as your taste.
How long does grape juice last?
Drinking fresh grapes juice is always better. Freshly extracted grape juice lasts for a few hours if not refrigerated soon. But, you can also preserve the grape juice for extended periods using a refrigerator and freezer. If you store the juice in a refrigerator, it‚Äôs not wise to store them for more than 10 days. In case of freezing, the grape juice may last 6-8 months if unopened.
Can you drink grape juice daily?
You may consume unsweetened or tart grape juices daily. But before drinking sweetened grape juice, you have to take the extra precaution as sweet grape juice is high in sugar that may increase your weight and may hamper your diet plan. Therefore, to avoid any unwanted issues, we recommend drinking juice twice to fourth times a week.
How much grape juice should you drink a day?
According to WebMD, one should not drink unsweetened grapes juice more than half a cup (1/2) per day. They said half cup juice contains low calories, fat, sugar, and carbohydrate, and vitamin C, potassium, calcium, magnesium, and phosphorus which are extremely helpful for health.
What is the best time to drink grape juice?
You can drink grape juice almost all the time. But, the best time to drink is the morning before breakfast on an empty stomach. You may also take juice 1 or 2 hours after breakfast. Besides, you can drink grape juice before and after the workout. If you want to drink at night, it is better to have less grape juice 2-3 hours before bedtime avoiding weight gain. Some expert says grape juice is good for quality sleep.

An Aadhaar card is a 12-digit unique number issued by the Government of India and is only issued to resident Indians. Applying for an Aadhaar card is a simple and seamless process and one do the same either at an Aadhar facilitation centre, your bank, post office or even online. Let us now look at Aadhar card registration from the point of view of the process involved. Here is how to apply for Aadhar card online.
/>
Understanding the process to apply for Aadhar Card..
The first step in applying for an Aadhar card is to ensure that all your requisite documents are in place. Also check that your registered mobile number for Aadhar is an active number as you will need to receive a One Time Password (OTP) on the mobile. To begin with, you can book the appointment and then visit the enrolment centre or your nearest post office or your bank. All these are authorized Aadhar application centres. Once the appointment is sought, the next steps for applying for Aadhar will be as follows:
Submit the Aadhaar enrolment form along with the proof of identity document at the centre. You can use your passport, driving license, election card, pension card or other such government authorized documents as proof of identity.
The submitted documents will be verified against the information entered in the application form. Aadhar has a good system of asking you to verify the entire data set online to avoid any change later. After that the individual‚Äôs biometrics (finger print proofs of multiple fingers) will be taken.
In fact, the biometric process includes taking an iris scan (of the eye) and all ten fingerprints. This is not done for applicants below the age of 5 years.
An acknowledgement slip will then be generated which will contain the applicant‚Äôs Aadhaar enrolment ID. This is an important piece of document as it will be your only proof of having submitted your Aadhar application. Keep it safe till you get your actual Aadhar copy.
You can check your Aadhar status online
After the procedures at the enrolment centre, applicants will receive an enrolment ID which can be used to check the status of Aadhaar. To check the status you can just go to the UIDAI website and you can follow these steps:
Go to the official website UIDAI
Click ‚ÄòCheck Aadhaar status‚Äô and enter the enrolment number
The applicants have to submit a security code.
Click the ‚Äòcheck status‚Äô button
The status of the applicant‚Äôs Aadhaar card will be shown on the screen.
You don‚Äôt have to wait for the physical copy of Aadhar to be sent to you. You can download from the website of UIDAI and that is as good as the original. In fact, the government of India has confirmed the same.
The physical copy of the Aadhar card will reach your address in 90-100 days but for your use the UIDAI provides online service to download and print the soft copy of Aadhaar card which is accepted everywhere. Avoid laminating the Aadhar card as it disturbs the bar code in the Aadhar code. A simple printout is good enough.
Remember the importance of the One-time-password (OTP)
The mobile number of each individual is part of the security aspect, whether it is for Aadhar card details or for online banking. The manner in which the Aadhar system is designed requires the use of an OTP (One Time Password). An OTP is usually sent to your registered mobile number and simultaneously to your email too.. Getting an Aadhar card is not only simple but it is also compulsory to have one. It is an accepted proof of identity for all practical purposes.

"Either this nation shall kill racism, or racism shall kill this nation." (S. Jonas, August, 2018)
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Introductory Note:
The current version of this column, which itself is based on two previous columns of mine on the same subject, was published elsewhere (see below) before Trump's announcement of the choice of Judge Amy Coney Barrett () to replace Justice Ginsburg on the Bench. (We won't comment on how the Trumpublicans¬© in the Senate under Moscow Mitch are redefining the Yiddish term "gall.") Presumably Judge Barrett will be confirmed before the election, with Trump hoping of course that she will be a vote for him in case an election gets to be decided once again by the Supreme. I'm not actually sure that that would happen. But that is a matter for another time.
What is a matter for this time is that Judge Barrett is a self-defined Far Rightist whose doctrines, as she makes clear are informed by Catholic Dogma (not used derogatorily). All of her positions on abortion and contraceptive rights are based on an extreme version of the "life begins at the moment of conception" doctrine, a concept new-at-the-time invented and handed down by Pope Pius IX in 1869 (see below). And so, for example, Judge Barrett would illegalize abortion for genetically-damaged fetuses at the option of the parents, thus condemning both the child and the parents to living the rest of their lives in that state, and in many cases changing their economic circumstances, to satisfy Judge Barrett's religious doctrine that life begins at the moment of conception. That is an example of religious authoritarianism --- religious views determining the content of the law and government policy in carrying them out dictatorially --- to the extreme. This is what our nation will be facing if former Vice-President Biden does not win the Presidency and if the Democrats do not then move to restructure the Supreme Court as outlined below. And so, to the column originally intended for this space.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
As many observers have noted, with the passing of Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg our nation is heading into what could be an enormously retrograde period in regard of individual rights and liberties. In the immediate future Trump is going to get his far-Rightist woman (whichever one) confirmed to the Supreme Court. Even if John Roberts, a Rightist himself, but not that far a Rightist, continues to maintain something of an institutionalist approach to the Constitution and the role of the Court, again as is well-known, in the immediate future the Court will at least be a consistent 5-4 Right. And Trump, actually celebrating the Justice's death (while at the same time revealing what he thinks of his chances of re-election with fair vote-counting), gleefully said words to the effect of "Now I can win a second term, 6-3."
Now, IF Biden can win the Presidency, and IF the Democrats can take the Senate with more than one seat to spare (one does not want to be in the position of having to count on Joe Manchin), as is well-known, the Democrats could a) end the filibuster, b) admit the District of Columbia and Puerto Rico as reliably Democratic states, and c) pack the Court. Of course, even with the requisite number of Senate seats, that master of the Senate Rules Moscow Mitch could possibly figure out a way to gum up the works. But before we would need to start worrying about that, we would have to get to that position first.
In the meantime, Trump could remain in the Presidency. Notice that I did not say "win," because I don't think that he can. But the Trumpublicans¬© probably have cheating systems in place (including the mass theft and destruction of paper ballots before counting) that even Greg Palast (How Trump Stole 2020) hasn't thought of. So, especially with the Court suddenly tilted sharply his way, Trump could still be there. And then, in terms of civil liberties, everything would be under attack. Especially Roe v. Wade and abortion rights (and oh how I wish that the pro-abortion rights movement would use that term instead of the more common "we favor abortion." For actually, no one favors abortion if it can be avoided. But that's another story.) The battle will be joined.
The essence of Roe v. Wade was that, until the generally accepted time of fetal viability outside the womb, 24 weeks, nation-wide women were to have freedom of choice in the outcome of pregnancy. The anti-abortion-rights movement lay fairly low during the 1970s. It began ramping up with the advent of the Reagan Administration. In the 1980 campaign, Candidate Reagan and the leadership of the Republican Party decided to use the issue as one means of bringing the then-developing Political Religious Right further into their Party.
It was at about that time that the anti-abortion-rights forces began using the term "pro-life" to characterize their movement. ("Pro-life" is a term that was actually invented after the end of the Second World War by Hitler's Pope, that great pro-lifer who kept his own counsel about the Holocaust during the War, Pius XII.) And since that time, even some elements of the pro-choice movement have used the term "pro-life" to describe the anti-choicers. Thus at least some focus has been lost over what was in fact at the center of Roe v. Wade, which was decided on a "right to privacy" interpretation of the 14th Amendment. But there is a very big additional support-for-individual liberties issue out there, just waiting to be mobilized. And that is the issue of religious authoritarianism.
As it happens, the position of the anti-abortion-rights forces is based exclusively on the religious concept of "when life begins." They make no bones about this. As is well-known, they equate abortion with murder, because according to them "life begins at the moment of conception." But that is an entirely religious concept. Let's repeat that for many people, even on the abortion-rights side, miss it. "Pro-life" is an entirely religious concept. For the Protestant side of the anti-abortion-rights movement the authority for their position is the "inerrant word of God" as found in one particular version of the Bible.
That the version most often cited by the anti-choicers member of that committee. And, of course, what does that say about the myriad other versions of the Bible, appearing in numerous translations from the original Aramaic, Hebrew, Greek, and Latin? Why, it also might be asked, did God wait so long to have an inerrant version produced?)

Seeds are the plays that change and grow throughout their stage time, and perhaps in the minds of audiences forever. In this way, the theatre production Accidentally Brave is a stone. Not just for the audience, but the author, Maddie Corman as well. In the play, Maddie Corman gives a very riveting performance of the situations she has gone through and still hangs in her heart, and perhaps may always. Or as Maddie Corman humorously puts it, ‚ÄúAs we begin this journey‚Äìoh my God, I hate the term journey‚Äìokay before we begin this thing, you should know that I‚Äôm not okay‚Äù
As far as Ms. Corman can recall, this ‚Äúthing‚Äù started during the summer of 2015. As Ms. Corman was driving at 5 am to a TV soundstage, to record one episode of a semi-terrible television show she got a call from her home based in Dobbs Ferry, New York. Her sixteen-year-old daughter screams in terror while her eleven-year-old boys are crying in the background. Police are on the premises and are taking their father‚Äôs computer.
Their father, Jace Alexander, is a film director famous for his work on Law and Order. According to various reports, when investigators entered the premises they recovered files from Alexander‚Äôs computer that portrayed minors engaging in sexual activities.
What would you do when you realize that your marriage partner of seventeen years, children‚Äôs father, true love, confidant, favorite persons, who listens to NPR and sings songs at the piano, is a person who compulsively watches child pornography?
Accidentally Brave recounts the confusion and shame Ms. Corman experienced as each prop beneath her stable, warm, suburban lifestyle gets knocked right out. The emotional turmoil does not end even after her husband finishes a forty-five-day rehabilitation for sex addiction, and is sentenced to a 10 year probation period in 2016. Consequently, Mr. Alexander must register himself as a sex offender, despite the fact that there have never been any accusations or claims of him touching a child.
As the family moves to a new residence, and transfer their twins to a new school, and are forced to forgo normal conveniences such as inviting kids to their house to trick-or-treat and coaching youth soccer, Ms. Corman tries to come to terms with their new life and tries to explore how it all happened, and what she can do to get through it. In the one-woman show, Maddie Corman plays many characters including friends and family members.
Accidentally Brave is not entirely about providing answers. Instead, Maddie Corman offers a couple of details about Jace Alexander. Maddie Corman believes that what happened to Mr. Alexander is not her story to tell. Although Maddie Corman breaks this rule a few times by suggesting the existence of some explanatory events that occurred during Mr. Alexander‚Äôs teenage years, Ms. Corman to no extent inhibits Mr. Alexander as she inhibits herself, her friends, and children, both fair-weather and stalwart. Ms. Corman does not even mention Mr. Alexander‚Äôs name.Michigan now releasing data on rare condition affecting some young children with COVID-19
The Michigan Department of Health and Human Services is now regularly releasing data about cases of an inflammatory condition that has affected some children who were, according to the state website, ‚Äúinfected with the virus that causes COVID-19, or had been around someone with COVID-19.‚Äù
There have been 58 confirmed cases in Michigan since April, according to a January 7 update. That is 15 more cases reported since the mid-December update. Their ages range from zero to 20.
The rare and serious condition, Multisystem Inflammatory Syndrome in Children (MIS-C), is found in children and teenagers under 21. MIS-C causes multiple organ systems to become inflamed or dysfunctional.
In October, Michigan was among only eight other states that would not disclose how many children died of COVID-19. MDHHS also did not confirm how many died of MIS-C.
But the state changed course over the holidays, releasing its first batch of data detailing MIS-C cases from the beginning of the pandemic through Dec. 14. Now, MIS-C data will be updated every first and third Thursday of the month, starting Jan. 7.
MDHHS writes on its website it is not yet known definitely what causes MIS-C. Doctors like Sabrina Heidemann, director of the medical pediatric ICU at Children‚Äôs Hospital in Detroit and Central Michigan University faculty member, first thought they were treating another condition ‚Äî Kawasaki disease. But the definition didn‚Äôt completely fit and Kawaski doesn‚Äôt usually send children to the ICU.
Dr. Heidemann and her fellow physicians at Children's Hospital began looking at COVID-19 and COVID-19 antibodies, realizing those were elevated and that it was a factor. It was ‚Äúmind-teasing,‚Äù she said, as they figured out the best treatment.
Heidemann said Children‚Äôs Hospital saw a ‚Äúhuge wave‚Äù of MIS-C cases in April and May, with more than 20 patients. The summer slowed down before another spike in December, similar to the case rates in the adult population. While her patients have recovered, she said there is a need to visit the cardiologist down the line to see if there have been long-lasting effects.
Forty-two cases have been admitted to the Intensive Care Unit across the state. Northern Michigan mother Kandace Day had her own terrifying encounter with the ICU after seeing her four-year-old son Charlie med-evacked to Grand Rapids, where he was hooked to ten different machines, including a ventilator. He was there for over two weeks.
‚ÄúSeeing my little boy, that was running around with his two little brothers laughing, giggling, and then waking up from being on a ventilator for four days, not knowing who I was ‚Äì it was very depressing and emotional for us,‚Äù she said.
‚ÄúDoctors were coming in all times of the hours because he was like, ‚ÄòWhat is going on with your little body?‚Äô‚Äù
Day said Charlie left the hospital Dec. 23, still feeling ill and was on multiple medications. While he is doing better and the inflammation is gone from his body, Day said Charlie may have scarring on the heart and in the lungs. She was also told by doctors Charlie has Parkinson‚Äôs-like symptoms, where inflammation reached his brain.
The state, as it did in October, is not disclosing exactly how many young people have died due to MIS-C. Currently, MDHHS reports ‚Äúfive or fewer‚Äù have died due to MIS-C.
Demographic information has also been released:
- Black children and white children both have 26 cases each.
- Six cases were from Hispanic or Latino children.
- Thirty cases were girls and 28 were boys.
- Twenty-four cases are from children between the ages of five and ten, and 18 cases from those older than ten. Sixteen of the 58 cases are from kids younger than four years.
As of December 4, the Centers for Disease Control reported 1,288 MIS-C cases and 23 deaths among 44 states, New York City and Washington D.C. Large states, like New York and Texas, are seeing the highest number of cases. The CDC is not reporting individual state counts, to protect the privacy of patients and their families because there are so few cases in most states.
The CDC also notes more than 75% of reported cases have occurred in children who are Hispanic or Latino or Black, Non-Hispanic. However, Hispanic/Latino and Non-Hispanic Black populations are also more likely to contract COVID-19 ‚Äî the CDC said additional studies into MIS-C are needed, especially looking at race and ethnicity.
The CDC says most of the children developed MIS-C two to four weeks after coming into contact with COVID-19. Symptoms can include gut pain, vomiting, diarrhea, neck pain, rashes, bloodshot eyes, or fatigue. Persistent fevers are a fever lasting more than a day ‚Äî this can be subjective, but the temperature may be around 100.4¬∞F. In some cases there are respiratory symptoms, but not always.
Michigan has asked health care providers and local health departments to ‚Äúmaintain a high degree of suspicion for MIS-C in pediatric and adolescent patients,‚Äù especially as it is similar to other illnesses seen in children.
Dr. Heidemann suggested parents should monitor their child‚Äôs health a month after contracting COVID-19.
‚ÄúIt's like with any other infection. Many times children don't get sick from many different infections, but then there's always a small group that can have severe problems later on down the line. So I would keep that in the back of my mind if my child had COVID-19 and if they got fevers. I would bring it up with the pediatrician.‚Äù
CDC investigators say while children appear to be less likely to be severely ill, they are still learning more about MIS-C‚Äôs risk factors as well as monitoring the situation to see if they need to implement any MIS-C recommendations.
As for Charlie, his mother says he is doing better ‚Äî smiling, giggling, happy to be home. While he cannot run the way he did before COVID-19, he has relearned how to walk, eat and drink. He is getting better day by day, she said.
There have been 516,376 total cases of coronavirus in Michigan, with over 13,000 deaths as of January 8. More than half of those cases were reported in the last two months.
Day said mothers from other states who also had children in the hospital due to MIS-C have reached out to her after hearing her story.
‚ÄúThis may seem like a joke right now. All of a sudden, it hits,‚Äù Day said. ‚ÄúWe don't know much about it. My son almost died a month after having COVID. It's scary. And I feel like people should be scared of the unknown.‚Äù

Often drug tests are conducted in various situations to authenticate your credibility. To prevent the effects of positive drug test results on the cost of your scenario either the custody case or employment, you need an effective and working method to pass the drug test. Among the other detox methods, niacin pills are also used to flush the system from drugs.
How many niacin pills to take to pass your drug test and how long does the effect last? In this guide, you will get everything for passing the drug test with Niacin. So, keep on reading.
What is Niacin and in What Cases It is Used?
Niacin also referred to as Nicotinic Acid or Vitamin B3 was initially recognized during the study of nicotine. Niacin is an essential mineral and its deficiency can cause various diseases like Pellagra, Hartnup diseases, and Carcinoid syndrome. It is necessary to keep the various systems and skin healthy. Natural food sources rich in Niacin include yeast, milk, tortillas, and grains.
Generally, Niacin Pills Are Used For:
Niacin pills are prescribed by doctors to treat various diseases including cardiovascular and pellagra.
It helps to increase the HDL in the body to reduce the concentration of LDL (bad cholesterol) in the bloodstream. Niacin is used as a supplement to cure cardiovascular and skin health.
Most importantly, it is used for the treatment of the Niacin deficiency condition, pellagra. Pellagra is a severe disease that can lead to 4 D's: Diarrhea, Dermatitis, Dementia, and even Death. Diet supplemented with Niacin and other vitamin complexes help to recover the loss.
Apart from the diseases, niacin pills are used to pass the drug test. No scientific study proves that niacin pills can flush the toxins out of the body. But the online discussions and platforms on the internet suggest that a significant dose of niacin pills can yield negative drug results. Passing the drug test with niacin tablets also has some side effects.
How Could Niacin Help You to Beat a Drug Test?
The heavy dose of niacin pills to pass a drug test is not safe as compared to other approaches like detox products or fake urine kits.
Niacin works in two ways to flush the THC from the body to pass the drug test.
First, it speeds up the metabolism by which the THC is excreted from the body. As THC is fat-soluble, when you burn fat, THC is eliminated. Niacin pills fasten the process and rapidly remove the THC metabolites from the body to pass the drug test.
Moreover, it opens up the blood vessels so that the THC can easily be flushed out of the body.
How much niacin you should take depends upon your age. The RDI for adults and males above fourteen is 14-18mg per day.
How Many Niacin Pills to Take To Pass a Drug Test?
The most common question to be cleared is how much niacin should I take to pass a drug test because the single potential dose of niacin could cause liver damage.
Anecdotal evidence suggests taking 2500mg of the capsule. But it can be toxic to the liver, following steps can help to prevent potential side effects of Niacin.
The best practice is to take 500mg of niacin pill at a time, either in the morning, and drink two glasses of water.
Take another pill of 500mg after six hours. Don't take over dosage of niacin and too much water to prevent the side effects.
Two pills of 500mg one every six-hour is enough to pass your drug test.
Also, take vitamin B12 capsule and creatinine monohydrate to ensure the correct appearance and values for the drug test.
Does Niacin Flush Free Work to Pass a Drug Test or Regular method?
The regular method with niacin to flush the toxins from the body is associated with high risks like:
Liver failure
Vomiting
Nausea
Hypoglycemia
Indigestion
Rapid heartbeat
Abdominal pain
For those people who cannot bear the niacin flush, the flush-free method is used. The method is simple and constitutes the use of a flush-free or no-flush form of niacin. It is not a good option to pass the weed detox with the flush-free niacin pills because they don't rapidly burn the fat and remove the metabolites from the body. Moreover, it is also associated with liver toxicity and decreased ability to lower cholesterol. Check this link for more detail.
Flush-free doesn't produce the niacin in the blood so effective flushing is not achieved. Regular methods cause side effects, including burning or redness on the skin. These symptoms can be alleviated by the use of 325mg of aspirin. But the regular method is more efficacious while comparing the regular vs flush free method and performs the fast flushing of drug metabolites. The success rate of niacin depends on various factors including the:
Days for supplementation of niacin before the test
Amount of dosage takes each day
Number of days before the test
Water consumed each day
Which format of niacin is consumed
Which drug you have consumed
Age, health and Body Composition
How Long Does Flushing Last with Niacin?
How fast can niacin cleanse your system? Probably, it takes niacin two to four hours to cleanse your system out of THC. The intermediate form of niacin "Niaspan" can stay for about 12-24 hours in the body. Even in case of a high dose, your body will be cleaned from the Niacin in 48 hours. The effect of Niacin flushing to remove the THC from the body lasts for about five hours.
But be aware not to exceed the safe amount of niacin. 2 grams or more niacin for a significant time period can be harmful and result in liver damage.
Conclusion
Niacin is used by various online users for passing drug tests. But the reviews and evidence show that the high dose of niacin can be associated with side effects like vomiting or extreme conditions like liver damage. Niacin flushing can cleanse the system from the drugs and remove the THC from fat cells through urine. To avoid the potential damage caused by niacin pills, it is best to take 500mg of pills every six hours with two glasses of water.Recent blog posts I have read today have stated that the Twitter era is now over, everything is moving hyper-local. I don‚Äôt believe this for one second. Perhaps users are getting bored of Twitter, but Twitter has taught us a lot of things about the way we organise, communicate and participate. I don‚Äôt see it dying, Twitter for me, is simply a symbol of the desire for real-time communications.
Creative Nerds Twitter Bird Logo
Twitter has Taught Us: Organisation
The simplicity of Twitter‚Äôs categorisation can be split into two areas ‚Äì Lists and HashTags. What this has taught the average user is that they can organise themselves within a fast moving environment simply by creating human bookmarks ‚Äì Lists and simple tagging ‚Äì Hashtags. As a business, we have started using this as a way of coding databases to make sure that we are communicating around the same subjects ‚Äì its simple, effective and creates a very organised pathway for identifying topics and content that is interesting.
Twitter has taught us: Communication
Simply put, there are not many faster ways to outwardly communicate what we are doing or what we are interested in than 140 characters. Twitter has taught us that we all desire real-time interaction and communication. FourSquare has taught us that we want this on a very local basis. What started as a microtrend ‚Äì I‚Äôm not sure if anyone calls it microblogging anymore? Micro-what-ing? ‚Äì has now triggered replicas across the board ‚Äì Facebook Status Updates, Yammer, there are multiple replicas of the Twitter idea yet Twitter is always the reference point. It is the figurehead for how we now want to communicate.
Twitter has taught us: Participation
Easy to do, easy to get involved. Simple features such as the retweet function have enabled everyone to feel like they belong within the Twitter community. Even though comments flash past quicker than you can act, Twitter still has a way of enabling you to participate. 9 times out of 10, you may simply get ignored.. but at least you feel that with the @function your comments do get seen. This is what social media should be‚Ä¶ a simple way of participating without having to seriously learn any new technology, be a genius (a guru?) and really interesting if you only spend five minutes in the environment.
This is what Twitter has taught us about ourselves:
1) We are now real-time. Those that aren‚Äôt distinctly miss out on our involvement be they brands, friends, colleagues or god forbid...family.
2) We like to have simple ways of organising ourselves and the things around us. Twitter has given simple mechanics which can be used elsewhere in life.
3) We love an easy ride. Participation can be embarrassing if you simply don‚Äôt understand what you are supposed to do. Walking into the local pub, where everyone goes quiet for a minute wondering why you are there? ‚Äì we hate that don‚Äôt we. Simple participative tools enable an easy ride.
Twitter is dead, long live real-time communication.

VESA¬Æ is a registered trademark of the Video Electronics Standards Association..Three years ago my husband and I were so out-of-sync with one another that our marriage was officially starting to crumble; we were systematically taking steps for a divorce. I have NEVER been in such a dark place in all my life! I knew that this decision would affect 3 others' lives (our children).
Since I am an independent-type woman and do not wear my problems on my sleeve, I suffered in silence. But, an angel was sent to me. An amazing woman moved a few streets over and happened to attend my same church where we met. We started running in the mornings together. Each morning she was my therapist just listening to my heartache. One day, though, she encouraged me to do something -- to read your "The Proper Care and Feeding of Husbands" book. I had such enmity towards my husband that it took days for bits of my pride to be chinked away. After several weeks of counseling with my angel-friend, prayer on my knees, listening to that inner Spirit guide me, and buckets of tears, I implemented a few of your truths. My husband responded!!
Our progress was so slow because of our open scars and because of the need to rewind a divorce-is-eminent mindset. In the end, our relationship was stronger than ever before -- probably because we had gone to hell and back. One evening after a surprise dinner I had made for my honey (with the kids off to a friend's house) and some amazing lovemaking, in the afterglow of it all he asked excitedly, "Will you marry me?" as we laughed and burst with so much love for one another. During that moment, and too-numerous-to-count since then, I feel deeply Shakespeare's words: "I can no answer make but thanks, and thanks."
I had no idea of the spiritual, emotional, and physical impact our stronger marriage would have upon my soul. I became healthier physically than ever before, dropping much weight. I felt unstoppable because life was rockin'! So my honey asked me what I wanted to do with this new passion. That sent me on a journey to become a certified personal trainer, certified nutritionist, and certified weight management consultant. I run my training business out of my studio gym in my home. Over this past year I have found myself using your principles and many others to be somewhat of a life coach for the women I train physically.
I decided to put my experience and training into a real program to help more women that I cannot personally train. It's been a lot of work writing my training program, but a few weeks ago Tate Publishing offered me a contract to publish my program. If I help one mother out there it will be worth all of the work because she will affect generations. As my mind continues nonstop to think of how I can expand my business and follow the compellings from God to do this, you popped in my head this morning. I would be remiss if I didn't simply say, "Thank you, Dr. Laura, for following what YOU are compelled to do."

When fishing was the premier industry on the coast, a constant flow of ships frequented Ucluelet's processing and packing plants. With the boom in eco-tourism, however, the town is scrambling to reinvent itself. It now offers a few fine B&Bs and cabin resorts but has yet to catch up to Tofino. Ucluelet is cheaper though, just as close to Long Beach, and more likely to have vacancies in the high season.
Fishing, kayaking, and whale-watching are the main attractions. For custom fishing charters, contact Roanne Sea Adventures, in the boat basin (tel. 250/726-4494;). To combine lodging with your fishing expedition, check out Island West Resort, 1990 Bay St. (tel. 250/726-7515;), or, for more luxury, Oak Bay Marine Group's Canadian Princess Resort.
Subtidal Adventures, 1950 Peninsula Rd., in the West Ucluelet Mall (tel. 877/444-1134 or 250/726-7336;), offers whale-watching trips, kayaking expeditions, and a sunset cruise into the Broken Group Islands (C$89 adult). Aquamarine Adventures, Small Craft Harbour Floathouse 200, near the base of Hemlock Street (tel. 866/726-7727 or 250/726-7727;), operates whale-watching tours (C$79-C$89) using 12-seater Sundancers, rigid-hulled inflatable vessels that allow for maximum maneuverability. Majestic Ocean Kayaking, 1167 Helen Rd. (tel. 800/889-7644 or 250/726-2868;), offers 3-hour kayak trips around Ucluelet harbor (C$60 adults) and more adventurous day-trips to the Broken Group Islands (C$235 adults).
The 3km (1.9-mile) Wild Pacific Trail takes you out to the Amphitrite Lighthouse, a prime whale-watching spot.
Broken Group Islands
Lying off the coast of Ucluelet in Barkley Sound are the Broken Group Islands, an archipelago of about 300 islands and islets that are part of Pacific Rim National Park. Due to the relatively calm waters, abundant wildlife, and dramatic seascapes, these islands are popular destinations for experienced sea kayakers and ocean canoeists. Divers can explore historic shipwrecks as well as reefs teeming with marine life. The underwater drop-offs shelter large populations of feather stars, rockfish, and wolf eels that grow as long as 2m (6 1/2 ft.) and occasionally poke their heads out of their caves.
Access to the Broken Group Islands is limited. In Ucluelet, you'll find a number of operators who can arrange a trip, including Majestic Ocean Kayaking, with fully guided 4-day trips to the islands beginning at C$999. You can also pass through the islands on a packet freighter from Port Alberni.
Sechart is also the site of the Sechart Whaling Station Lodge, an operation of Lady Rose Marine Services (tel. 800/663-7192 Apr-Sept, or 250/723-8313;). It primarily serves the needs of kayakers, though it's open to anyone who wants a unique wilderness experience. Rates are C$140 per person or C$210 for two people sharing the same room, including three family-style meals a day. The only ways to get to the lodge are via the packet freighters, a Toquart Connector Water Taxi (tel. 250/720-7358) from Bamfield, or your own vessel. Kayak rentals are available. For reservations, contact Lady Rose Marine Services (above).
Tofino
Once the center of massive environmental protests that drew the world's attention, Tofino is now a rather schizophrenic town -- part eco-tourism outfitters, activists, and serious granolas; part former loggers and fishermen; and part Tla-o-qui-aht and Ahousaht peoples, who live mostly outside the town. Conflict was common in the early years, but recently all parties seem to have learned to get along.
The reason for Tofino's popularity is not hard to fathom. Tofino offers incredible marine vistas at the end of a thin finger of land, battered by the Pacific to the west and lapped by Tofino Sound on the east. The town is notched with tiny bays and inlets, with a multitude of islands, many of them very mountainous, just off the coast. Farther east, the jagged, snowcapped peaks of Strathcona Park fill the horizon.
Tofino is becoming more crowded and subject to a particular brand of gentrification. On the beaches south of town, luxury inns serve the rarified demands of upscale travelers attracted to the area's scenery. There are more fine-dining restaurants and boutiques here than can possibly be justified by the town's size. Dining is as big a draw as sea kayaking for many Tofino visitors.
With all the bustle, it can be difficult at times to find solitude in what's actually still an amazingly beautiful and wild place. Accordingly, more people decide to avoid the crowds and visit Tofino in winter, to watch dramatic storms roll in from the Pacific.

In Variant Chess, winter 1991, after Erich Bartel's description of Patt- schach, G. P. Jelliss, editor of Variant Chess, wrote about the related game Upside-down chess. Upside-down chess is played on most of the Internet chess servers under the name Wild 5. On these servers, the game is played without promotion restrictions. White appears to have a big advantage in this game. A server where this game is popular (along with atomic and `crazyhouse-one player bughouse' chess) can be found at
telnet chess.mds.mdh.se 5555.
Rules
The game starts in the following position:
Note that the position is not the orthodox chess position: the pieces of white are at the side of black and vice versa. In particular, pawns can promote rather easily.
You can, as you like, play with or without the following rule: Pawns may only promote to a piece that is taken by the opponent. When no such piece is available, it is forbidden to move the pawn to the last row.
All other rules are as in orthodox chess.
Written by Hans Bodlaender, with thanks to Tom Coffrey for his information on the game as played on the Internet Chess Servers.

Last night RuPaul‚Äôs Drag Race All Stars 3 saw the return of the eliminated queens, and a lot of drama. Milk versus Kennedy. Aja versus Bebe. Morgan versus Bendela. Everyone versus Trixie because Thorgy got to stir the pot. And then things got really wild.
Spoilers
Hey, so you want to know what‚Äôs insanely infuriating? I didn‚Äôt see all of ‚ÄúHandmaids to Kitty.‚Äù I don‚Äôt have cable, so I rely on an iTunes subscription to keep current with All Stars 3. AND for unknown reasons, the iTunes upload lacks the ending of the this week‚Äôs ep. But it doesn‚Äôt just cut off. It leaps from Bebe and Bendela considering their lipsticks, then jumps to the ‚ÄúNEXT WEEK ON ALL STARS‚Äù promo. At first I thought the ep did this on purpose, but that‚Äôd be a weird place to end it. And why give away in the trailer that Morgan Michaels is back next week? Then I went to World of Wonder‚Äôs youtube channel to see what it‚Äôs behind the scenes post was about if there wasn‚Äôt an eliminated queen. And THAT‚Äôs how I found out BenDeLaCreme fell on her sword.
So, I‚Äôm steamed. Of all the eps for this to happen on!
But I don‚Äôt want my personal nightmare to hold up your funtimes in comments. So, here‚Äôs what I do know: the producers brought the eliminated queens back for a team challenge that gave one of the gone girls a chance to re-enter the game. Aja shined, finally pulling out of the ‚Äúsweet‚Äù schtick to do something interesting. And overall the team seemed to kill the girl group routine. Yet somehow not only did the Top 5 still win, but also Bebe was in the top two again. I just don‚Äôt get it. But whatever.
Back in the workroom, Bebe and Bendela are basically swarmed by queens making their case for why they should stay. And bless Chi Chi for throwing shade with ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt want to be the Roxxy Andrews of All Stars 3.‚Äù (Chi Chi, we love you.) And all this pressure is really getting to Bendela, who has been the frontrunner for much of the season. So, are the message board rumors true that the pressure cracked this could-be champion and sent her home on her own volition? MAYBE!
Here‚Äôs World of Wonder‚Äôs video. I haven‚Äôt watched it because I‚Äôm waiting on actually seeing the end of the episode. Please respect my privacy in this time of grief and irritation.

‚ÄúWe chose to participate because the river provides us with our drinking water supply, as well as hours of fun boating, floating, water-skiing, and fishing. Our mission was to help the environment, but in the process, Project AWARE gave back to us. My daughter and I pitched a tent beside strangers who quickly became our friends and cleanup teammates. During the week, experts taught us about plant life, geological formations, artifacts, and how to properly navigate a canoe.

Playing musical chairs will be firmly off limits once you've tried out the Best Seat in the House position.
Fantastic for both vaginal or anal sex ‚Äì internal pleasure spots will be showered with attention, while hands are free to explore external hot zones.
How?
The giving partner sits in a chair and leans their body back, keeping their knees together with their feet lifted and toes on the floor. The receiving partner straddles the seated partner, facing away from them, with their body leaning slightly forward.
Why?
The receiving partner can step into the driving seat and take it nice and slow or get pulses racing with some bouncing up and down. Whichever pace they decide on, they can prepare for some delicious G-spot or P-spot stimulation, all in the comfort of a chair or sofa. Plus, there are two sets of completely free hands and fingers to caress external pleasure areas such as the clitoris, nipples and testicles, to create a heady mix of stimulation.
Try
If a little support is needed for the more vigorous of paces, the top partner can simply place their hands on the bottom partner's thighs and invite them to hold onto their waist to help lift them up and down.
Make it even better
"The perfect accessory can make the difference between looking blah and totally to die for." Apply Michael Kors logic to accessorising sex and foreplay, and you have yourself a 'totally to die for' sex life. Best Seat in the House is a prime example of how sex positions can be accessorised with extra buzz and stimulation. In fact, you're spoilt for choice.
Will you choose to heighten internal sensations with a wearable couples vibrator or strapless strap-on vibrator? Will the giving or receiving partner delight in anal stimulation from a vibrating butt plug?
Or will you go all out on the external stimulation with a bullet vibrator or vibrating cock ring (wear it so the clitoral stimulator is positioned on the underside of the penis if you're indulging in vaginal sex in this position)?

But I also looked through a window into a room containing eight babies, none more than two days old, their little cots covered in malaria nets. The doctors explained to me that in each of these cases, and hundreds more like them in the same hospital each year, the mother had died in childbirth.
The causes of death varied from bleeding and infection to high blood pressure and failure to survive a Caesarean section ‚Äì all so easily preventable by modern western standards. In Britain, for the same reasons, the death of a mother in childbirth was once a common hazard, a fixture of Victorian life.
Improvements over the past century in antenatal care, health education, and obstetric and gynaecological care have lowered the risks of childbirth. There may be more to do at home, particularly on the health risks to newborn babies. But nowadays, only seven in 100,000 women die when giving birth in Britain.
In sub-Saharan Africa, the conditions and health care for mothers in childbirth are often no better, and sometimes far worse, than we had in Victorian times. In 1987, more than 500,000 women were dying in pregnancy or childbirth every year across the world, 99 per cent of them in developing countries. More than half of all women were delivering their babies with no skilled birth attendant present.
It was because of this terrible toll that 20 years ago, the Global Safe Motherhood Initiative was launched by the World Health Organisation to try to reduce the rates of maternal death. In 2000, the United Nations recognised the shocking rates of maternal death and made their reduction one of the Millennium Development Goals. The fifth MDG committed the wealthiest nations to cut maternal mortality by three-quarters between 1990 and 2015..
Visit hospitals in Africa and it is easy to see why. While the Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting was going on in Uganda, I visited labour wards and delivery rooms at Muhimbili Hospital in Dar es Salaam and Mulago Hospital in Kampala. They are both huge referral hospitals attracting many women from across each city, and they offer the only real emergency obstetric care in their areas.
Mulago alone sees the delivery of 33,000 babies a year, almost one hundred a day. Compare that to the Edinburgh Royal Infirmary where my children were born, which is considered a big UK facility and where just 6,000 babies are delivered each year.
In all my visits, I saw overstretched services at work, committed teams with too few con sultants, nurses and midwives, and insufficient equipment and technical provision. Shortages included basic supplies such as sutures and painkillers, which run out whenever there is an extra-busy day for Caesarean sections or other emergency procedures.
The governments in Tanzania and Uganda are doing their best to make progress.
The Tanzanian president, Jakaya Kikwete, told me this was a personal passion for him, and that his government had pledged to put dispensaries around the country that could also offer antenatal care. In Uganda, I saw the nearly completed refurbishment of a maternity block in the Mulago Hospital grounds. But still the death toll remains stubbornly high.
And.
Avoidable deaths
It is obviously harder for a child to survive, grow and have a life with choices if there is no mother to provide care, food, protection and education. The statistics bear this out. A study in Indonesia showed that 14 per cent of children aged six to ten who had lost mothers dropped out of school, compared to only 7 per cent of those who had not. Poverty as an adult was far more likely for the former group.
The same study showed that children without mothers were four times more likely to die in their early years ‚Äì usually of malnutrition or disease ‚Äì compared to other children.
Internationally, pressure is growing, through the White Ribbon Alliance, a global campaign group dedicated to highlighting the avoidable tragedy of maternal death, supported by the WHO‚Äôs Making Pregnancy Safer campaign and the Partnership for Maternal, Newborn and Child Health. In the UK, the White Ribbon Alliance is led by the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists (RCOG) and I sit on its international advisory group. This has given me the opportunity to meet some of the world‚Äôs leading experts in this field. It has opened my eyes to the impact of maternal death on the life chances of infants.
The general causes are well understood: high fertility rates lead to greater pressure on resources, inadequate and inaccessible health care makes childbirth inherently risky, and women‚Äôs low status economically and culturally affects their access to health services and the priority they are given.
There is also broad agreement on the solutions required: greater resources, better education, better access to emergency care, availability of antenatal care to spot problems in advance and quick referrals for mothers with complications.
The RCOG International Office has designed a course teaching young consultants essential obstetric and newborn care. The course is available in Tanzania and Kenya, and I hope it will soon be extended to Uganda. Accompanied by Tony Falconer, RCOG senior vice-president, I met a young doctor in the antenatal clinic at Muhimbili Hospital who had completed the course two months before, and thought his training had already helped him save lives.
The RCOG is taking this work further. In South Africa, it is working to help obstetric experts develop a training package for all local doctors in their third postgraduate year, generally spent in more remote conditions. Momentum is building. I am hopeful that a special session will be devoted to maternal death at next year‚Äôs international summit in Davos and the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation is funding projects around the world to raise awareness.
At home, just over a month ago, the International Development Secretary, Douglas Alexander, announced at a conference in London that the UK would commit an extra ¬£100m towards improvements in reproductive health. To meet any of the Millennium Development Goals, we need the will, the means and the momentum. We have seen this in relation to vaccinations, free education and the fight against Aids. Now we must see it on the issue of maternal death, where no significant progress has been made, not just in the past seven years, but in the past two decades.
Each developing country needs a strategic health plan that takes account of local situations, expanding services so that populated central and remote areas alike acquire trained people and resources. The investment needed to improve maternal health is small, but the gains for the poorest children in the world will be huge. We must make 2008 the first year of progress on this neglected Millennium Development Goal.

Carmelo Anthony Has ‚ÄòMixed Feelings‚Äô About The Resumption Of The 2019-20 NBA Season
Last week, the NBA has officially announced the restart of the season in late July at Walt Disney World in Orlando, Florida. The resumption of the season will undergo a new format of 22-team plan which includes 13 Western Conference teams and nine teams of the Eastern Conference.
While most players and fans are happy that the season does resume, Carmelo Anthony has ‚Äòmixed feelings‚Äô about it:
‚ÄúI have mixed feelings about it! As far as basketball goes, yes, I‚Äôm ready. Let‚Äôs go to war, let‚ÄôS bring sports back. But to be honest with you, on the other side of that emotion, that feeling is just like I‚Äôm still battling on traveling kind of going down there to Orlando in the mist of everything that‚Äôs going on. Just being bunkered down and kind of isolated away from the rest of the world‚ÄùMovember is about raising awareness of men‚Äôs health issues and funds to support research. It‚Äôs also about having fun while doing it.
Here at Queen‚Äôs University, there is also a direct link from the fundraising to the work that is taking place.
The Caring Campus Project was created earlier this year thanks to a $1.7 million grant from Movember Canada. The three-year project ‚Äì which involves a team of 24 male students, primarily in second year from a variety of disciplines ‚Äì is aimed at creating a campus-wide effort to improve mental health as it relates to substance use, particularly for first-year male students.
In its first year, the project, led by Heather Stuart (Centre for Health Services and Policy Research and Public Health Sciences) and colleagues Shu-Ping Chen (Public Health Sciences) and Terry Krupa (School of Rehabilitation Therapy), will take place at Queen‚Äôs University but will subsequently branch out to the University of Calgary and Dalhousie University.
However, as research assistant Josh Decaire points out, the groundwork will be completed at Queen‚Äôs. He says the goal of hiring the students is that they will be running different initiatives and activities across campus aimed at raising awareness about the links between mental health and substance abuse.
‚ÄúThere's a lot of talk about mental health everywhere now but making the link with substance abuse doesn't seem to be as widely known,‚Äù Mr. Decaire says.
Following a summit in September the students have formed four groups, each with a different component to the overall campaign.
A pilot survey completed earlier this year showed that the disconnect is clear.
‚ÄúAs a student I was definitely interested in seeing what the data showed because I never really thought about how our drinking habits could affect other people,‚Äù says Ren√© Puerta (Com‚Äô17). ‚ÄúThat's something you might think that, okay, an alcoholic will have impacts on their family but a student who might be a two or three day a week drinker does as well. That's one of the bigger messages I would like to get across in this campaign.‚Äù
Mr. Puerta is part of the social media team that will be raising awareness through online platforms like Twitter and Facebook and handing out stickers, but also trying to foster change in attitudes toward drinking and behaviour among male students.
The main goal for the team he says is ‚Äúreclaiming‚Äù the phrase ‚ÄúFor The Boys,‚Äù which currently is associated with the degrading of women and reckless drinking. The team is now promoting the hashtag #QFTB ‚Äì Queen's For The Boys ‚Äì but this time meaning support for those in need.
Still, he knows that changing those attitudes, especially among first-year students, won‚Äôt be easy. Drinking and university life are intrinsically linked and are often portrayed in major media, particularly in film, he points out.
‚ÄúWe are trying to change years and years of social conditioning where university students are expected to drink heavily, when in reality there are so many other things to do,‚Äù he says. ‚ÄúIt will be hard to overcome those expectations.‚Äù
Andrei Lyskov‚Äôs (Com‚Äô17) team is creating an anonymous online forum to help those seeking support. He says that one of the research pieces showed that many people felt they didn't have anyone they could talk to due to overwhelming demand on resources and the stigma associated with seeking support.
‚ÄúSo our approach is a very preliminary approach to the issue of mental health and I think that if we are able to lower the number of students with mental health problems that in turn will help lower the amount of students abusing alcohol because there is typically a high correlation between drinking a lot and some sort of mental health issue,‚Äù he says.
He also says that creating a more caring campus that takes into account that other people might not share the same views is what university is about, and a key part of the campaign.
‚ÄúI think the key is just to start those hard conversations. So with the social media campaign and putting up the stickers around campus it will start people talking about the campaign,‚Äù he says. ‚ÄúIt also will hopefully raise awareness, particularly about the issues that many first-year males face like mental health and drinking.‚Äù
Another survey will be completed this spring, following the same basic outline and Mr. Decaire says Caring Campus will be looking for some positive results from the ongoing efforts, including personal usage patterns, perceptions of other people‚Äôs usage patterns and feelings for the campus culture as a whole.
‚ÄúWe are hoping that when we do the survey again in the spring semester we will see changes or some results indicating that there has been an impact of some kind,‚Äù he says.

Physocarpus opulifolius 'Aurea'
Ninebark
Plant Type:DECIDUOUS SHRUBS
Physocarpus opulifolius ‚ÄòAurea‚Äô (syn. ‚ÄòLuteus‚Äô) ‚Äì 'Aurea' is my favorite Ninebark cultivar. Why? The golden foliage is sun-proof, it doesn‚Äôt burn. Brilliant golden leaves will turn a light bright yellow-green in summer though in full blazing sun the outermost leaves tend to hold onto yellow tone. This form tends to grow wider than tall ‚Äì unusual in that most Ninebarks are upright and somewhat vase-shaped. And the autumn color? It‚Äôs a fluorescent combination of orange, gold, red, scarlet, coral and occasionally purple. White 2‚Äù corymbs are showy followed by reddish pink seed heads that linger long at the ends of branches. The winter affect is somewhat coarse but can contrast nicely with other deciduous plants and especially evergreens; the light brown bark does exfoliate and the seed pods are persistent. This is an adaptable low maintenance shrub that will even develop good autumn tones in some shade though more brilliant colors are assured in sunnier sites. And this selection has very good mildew resistance. We may prune this judiciously so that you will not incur an extra handling charge. And you may cut it back in the late winter to encourage a shorter brilliant yellow shrub. If purchased in autumn these will arrive partially pruned. Established potted Ninebark, cutting grown.

Kiis FM has reported that the paper ran a story after former Bachelor and personal trainer Sam Wood, 35, popped the question to his girlfriend, Snezana Markoski.
The paper ran a picture of ‚ÄúSam and Snezana‚Äù to go with the story ‚Äì however, it was runner-up Lana Jeavons-Fellows that was pictured, instead of Snez.
Awkward... and even more so considering that Lana was widely predicted to win the series (and Sam's heart).
Sam and mum of one Snezana got engaged after dating for just a few months after falling for each other on the hit reality show.
Shortly after their engagement, Sam shared the news on his Instagram, posting "When you know, you know." Snez was clearly over the moon, posting "Happiest Girl in the World‚Äù a short while later.
WATCH Sam and Snezana reveal their relationship. Post continues after video...
Just yesterday, the engagement ring designer Carson Wolf, of Bensimon Diamonds, revealed that the stunning princess cut, two carat, halo style sparkler came with an impressive $50,000 price tag.
Wold told Fairfax that he had met Wood in secret to finalise the design and that it had taken a team of jewellers a week to create.
We're not sure how such a big mistake could have happened,but we're guessing Sam and Snez are probably too preoccupied with their wedding planning to worry too much.
We're also guessing the paper will be sure to double and triple check it's Bachelor-related articles next time...

CHESTER, N.J. (PRWEB) August 31, 2020
Just found out your dear friend has cancer?
It‚Äôs hard to hear your doctor say the words ‚ÄúYou have cancer.‚Äù It‚Äôs heartbreaking when your friend or family member shares their diagnosis. Once the shock wears off, the questions and fears can be overwhelming.
How should I respond? What if I say the wrong thing? What are the best ways to help? Words are failing me. I‚Äôm scared. I want to DO something.
We‚Äôve talked to experts ‚Äì the cancer survivors and caregivers who serve as CHN Support Volunteers ‚Äì and have five practical ways to help.
*Choose your words carefully. Or just be.*
It sounds simple. But in their rush to find common ground, people say some pretty awful things. ‚ÄúMy aunt/cousin/colleague‚Äôs friend died from that!‚Äù ‚ÄúDid you smoke?‚Äù ‚ÄúHave you tried (insert alternative therapy here)?‚Äù
Think first. Don‚Äôt blurt out the first thing that comes to mind. There‚Äôs still a chance you‚Äôll say something you wish you could take back ‚Äì but it‚Äôs much less likely.
It‚Äôs ok to talk about topics other than cancer. ‚ÄúYou don‚Äôt need to say ‚ÄòI‚Äôm sure it‚Äôs gonna be ok,‚Äô‚Äù suggests two-time survivor Dale. ‚ÄúYou don‚Äôt know that. Keeping the conversation as normal as possible was so meaningful.‚Äù
Still not sure what to say? Saying nothing is ok too. Sometimes, there aren‚Äôt right words. But your presence ‚Äì physically or digitally ‚Äì can make all the difference.
*Don‚Äôt ask, do.*
Grabbing your keys (and a mask!) can help too. Survivor Ed recalls how meaningful it was to have his brother-in-law driving him to treatment. Support Volunteer Mona‚Äôs friends took her dancing after her first chemo. ‚ÄúMy friends were there to encourage me and give me strength when I was weak. I realized it‚Äôs true that you never know what strangers will become your friends and family.‚Äù
Asking for help is difficult. Offering help removes that burden from the patient we love. Anything that moves beyond ‚Äúlet me know if you need anything‚Äù is progress. Support Volunteer Kathy remembers small, everyday gifts of time and help. ‚ÄúSometimes, those ordinary moments are the best moments. The little things mean so much more than the big.‚Äù
*Check in. Consistently.*
Time and again, survivors remember the loneliness and isolation cancer brought. ‚ÄúI found out who my friends are. And who they weren‚Äôt,‚Äù said long-term cervical survivor Ellen. ‚ÄúSome people shut down and turned away. I know cancer scares a lot of people. You don‚Äôt know what to say. I don‚Äôt myself. But people who were just there made a huge difference. The smallest kindnesses mean something.‚Äù
Life‚Äôs busy. Checking in matters, but it doesn‚Äôt have to be dramatic. Survivor after survivor mentioned silly emails, funny memes and the quick call to say hello.
If life keeps getting in the way, setting a reminder or alarm is a good way to build the consistency you want to give and that your loved one so desperately needs.
*Think practical. Think small.*
Small portions make a big difference. Jenn recalls friends who brought a meal each week, ‚Äúit was often enough that we could eat for a couple days. It wasn‚Äôt too much ‚Äì and it was spaced out.‚Äù For caregiver Marlys, small, freezer-ready dishes made life while her husband was in hospice care more manageable.
If cooking‚Äôs not for you, gifts like pajamas, hats or (audio!) books are loving that‚Äôs a simple click away. Cleaning services make life easier. This really is one of those times that the thought counts.
*Connect*
Help isn‚Äôt just for patients. For caregivers thrust into a world of appointments and pickups and newfound duties while balancing their own responsibilities, it‚Äôs easy to feel overwhelmed. It‚Äôs also easy to feel guilty about being overwhelmed when you feel you ‚Äúshould‚Äù be focused on your loved one who ‚Äúhas it worse.‚Äù
‚ÄúYou have to call and get help. I‚Äôd call my daughter to come stay with him for a few hours. You need to have someone you can call on so you can take breaks. I couldn‚Äôt let myself get worn down ‚Äì my oncologist said I had to listen to my body ‚Äì no matter if it‚Äôs 80 degrees out and you should be out planting flowers, if you‚Äôre tired, lay down and take a nap. You can‚Äôt do it by yourself. You‚Äôre a person, you‚Äôre a human and you cannot.‚Äù ~Anne, survivor, caregiver
Most of all, remember that you and your friend are not alone. This journey is new for you, but you‚Äôre not the first to travel this road.
Speaking with someone who has faced a similar experience can provide comfort and hope. It can also provide more practical solutions and tips. Request a caregiver/friend match for yourself ‚Äì or encourage your friend to request a free and confidential match with a trained survivor Support Volunteer.
‚ÄúDoctors can only go so far ‚Äì they‚Äôll feed you the information that‚Äôs needed,‚Äù says esophageal survivor Joe. ‚ÄúCancer Hope Network has volunteers who have gone through the gauntlet and we‚Äôre able to talk to people on the same level and go through what‚Äôs about to happen to them.‚Äù

Each year, heart-related conditions, such as heart disease, heartworm and heart murmurs, affect our furry family members in a big way. In fact, Healthy Paws Pet Insurance says it processed nearly 4,000 heart issue-related claims in 2016 alone, based on information from their database of hundreds of thousands of pets.
While these conditions are fairly common, they come at a large cost for pet parents‚Äîthe average bill for treating a pet‚Äôs heart problem is $385. Last year alone, Healthy Paws Pet Insurance reimbursed a total of $929,000 in heart issue-related claims, with the highest claim coming in at a heart-pounding $12,736 for the treatment of a golden retriever‚Äôs heart condition.
The good news is there are simple lifestyle changes you can make to lower the risk of heart conditions in your cat or dog.
‚ÄúFeeding your pet a healthy diet, ensuring they get regular exercise and maintaining a healthy lifestyle to prevent obesity will help keep their heart in good health, decreasing the risk of developing certain conditions‚Äù says veterinarian Dr. Kristonn Colborn. ‚ÄúBe sure to have your pet examined once a year‚Äîtwice if they‚Äôre over seven years of age‚Äîto allow your vet the best chance to detect problems early on and provide treatment before disease has had the opportunity to progress.‚Äù
Pet parents can take the first step to protect their furry family members by visiting the Healthy Paws website for resources on pet health and wellness.New Delhi [India], Oct..

2019 Micro-hobby: A Poem a Month
Updated: Apr 1, 2019
My micro-hobby for the year is to put out a new poem, in whatever shape, once a month.
I'm doing this for a variety of reason that are mostly selfish. I don't get a chance to write as often as I would like and this forces me to write and revise often. This also gets me (will get me?) more comfortable with putting my writing out into the world. My first collection of poetry, Ancient Memories, only saw the light of day because my mother was dying and said, in her oh-so-dramatic way, that she just wished she could see me in print once before "the end." She may have also mentioned that she'd spent a "hell of a lot of money" on my education and "what has that gotten me?"
Oh, Mother...
So, this year, I will be putting one poem a month, on the first of each month, out into the world. These poem are all slated for my next collection, So Many Fishes, which I hope to have out by the end of the year.Your goal: knock your opponents off the map and be the last one standing.

That‚Äôs what some are wondering about after a model from his hit MTV series Wild N‚Äô Out shared the name she has in mind for her unborn son, and Cannon was the surname.
The beauty, Alyssa Scott, shared a photo of herself with her growing bump and captioned the image ‚ÄúZEN S. CANNON.‚Äù When asked by someone if that meant Cannon was the father, she just replied with ü•∞ü•∞ü•∞.
Scott is already the mother to a young daughter. As mentioned, Cannon is a father of a few kids at this point. He has his twins Morrocan and Monroe with ex-wife Mariah Carey, a son named Golden and a daughter named Powerful Queen with Brittany Bell. He currently has twin boys on the way with DJ Abby De La Rosa. If it‚Äôs true that he is the father of the son Scott is expecting, that would indeed make seven kids and counting for the 40-year-old star. Whatever the case, the rumor mill has been stirring, and Cannon has been trending over the possibility that he‚Äôs having back-to-back children.
He‚Äôs been vocal about his desire to expand his family over the years, including when he said on the ExpediTIously podcast, ‚ÄúI got kids. I got kids by different women and I want more kids‚Äù while at the same time, saying he didn‚Äôt want to be married or tied to one relationship. He most recently dated model Jessica White, and also model Lanisha Cole. He dated Scott, too, as the pair were pictured hanging out and riding around in his Bentley in Malibu last October. By January, she announced that she was expecting, and she‚Äôs due in June.

‚ô°If you love Hip-Hop or Indie reggae, then you must be familiar with the fantastic American Rapper, better known by the stage name N.–û.R.–ï. or the pseudonym Noreaga, New York City‚Äôs history of producing seminal hip-hop artists is an illustrious one, and it will instead be remiss of us to not call N.O.R.E., a.k.a Victor Santiago Jr., an indispensable component of the mid-90s.
N.O.R.E. aka Victor Santiago ,Jr. Being a product of the school-to-prison pipeline, he rose to prominence as one half of the East Coast mafioso duo Capone-N-Noreaga in an era during which hip-hop was at a commercial tipping point.

These hits also earned them a place on the top music charts such as the Billboard 200 and the Hot R&B.
After Capone‚Äôs imprisonment in 1997, Noreaga had to go the solo, and hence released his debut album as a solo rapper, ‚ÄúN.O.R.E.‚Äù which became a bigger hit than C-N-Ns debut album. ‚ÄúThe War Report, breaking all the records to be #3 on Billboard.

So you‚Äôre going to the Stone Brewing 15th Anniversary celebration at Cal State San Marcos on Saturday, and you‚Äôd like to drop by Lost Abbey to enjoy a hearty breakfast and perhaps a beer or two before you head off to attend your Session.
Problem is, you really don‚Äôt want to deal with the hassles of driving between the two locations.
Good news. You don‚Äôt have to.
The Lost Abbey is actually very close to the party‚Äôs location at Cal state San Marcos (a mere 4,800 ft as the crow flies), and there‚Äôs a number of options including the train, bike trails and walking paths that are just about as quick as driving your car between places. Here‚Äôs how to get there from here (or vice versa) without climbing in a car:
The Train
One of the best kept secrets around here is the Sprinter ‚Äî the light rail system that runs between Oceanside on the coast, and Escondido inland. You can hop on the train at San Marcos city center (Lost Abbey‚Äôs station) and off it again 3 minutes later at Cal State San Marcos (for the festival). The Sprinter is also bike friendly, so if you‚Äôd rather pedal than hoof it, you can.
Lost Abbey is a few minute(s) walk from the San Marcos City Center station, as is the Cal State San Marcos station from the festival. With a bike it‚Äôs less than half that time.
Trains run once an hour and the fare is $2 each way, or you can buy a $5 round trip pass that will take you from Oceanside to Escondido and back again (very convenient if you‚Äôd rather leave your car at the transit station or if you‚Äôre going all train via the Coaster, MetroLink or Amtrak).
Tip: Take the Inland Rail Trail (it‚Äôs on the map) to/from Sprinter and Lost Abbey. The trail avoids the street lights and a steep hill, so you‚Äôll travel all that much quicker.
MAP: Travel via the Sprinter

Walking / Biking
If you‚Äôre into the whole human-powered thing, it‚Äôs still pretty easy to go between Lost Abbey and the Anniversary Party just using your feet or a bike. (The distance is actually shorter than driving because you can cut through the parking lots and use the sidewalks and bike paths to avoid car routes.) If you‚Äôre driving and then hoofing/pedaling, make sure to park your car at Cal State San Marcos early and roll down the hill to Lost Abbey. You can have breakfast and burn a few carbs going back to the Stone event. When your Session is over your car will be waiting nearby.
Tip: Cut through the Old Spaghetti Factory / LA Fitness parking lot between Twin Oaks & Rancheros (it‚Äôs on the map). Cars have to drive around it, but you‚Äôll cut 1/2 a mile off your trip each way.

View Larger MapThis work is intended especially as a Supplement to my Sanskrit Grammar (Leipzig, 1879), giving, with a fulness of detail that was not then practicable, nor admissible as part of the grammar itself, all the quotable roots of the language, with the tense and conjugation-systems made from them, and with the noun and adjective (infinitival and participial) formations that attach themselves most closely to the verb; and further, with the other derivative noun and adjective-stems usually classed as primary: since these also are needed, if one would have a comprehensive view of the value of a given root in the language. And everything given is dated, with such accuracy as the information thus far in hand allows - whether found in the language throughout its whole history, or limited to a certain period.
My leading authority has necessarily been that magnificent thesaurus of authentic information respecting the Sanskrit language of every period , the great St. Petersburg Lexicon of Bohtlingk and Roth. This I have gone carefully over , excerpting all the material needed for my purpose. So far , indeed , as concerns the epic and classical literature, the Lexicon has been almost my sole source, since my own collections, for verification or of additional material , though not wholly wanting¬∑, have yet been altogether insignificant as compared with it. But in the older language, of Veda and BrƒÅhma·πáa and Upani·π£ad and S≈´tra, I have done much more independent work. I have, namely, gone over all the text of the earlier period accessible to me, including (by the kindness of Professor Weber) the as yet unpublished KƒÅu·π£ƒ´taki-BrƒÅhma·πáa and KƒÅ·π≠haka, and (by the kindness of the late Dr. Burnell) the immense JƒÅiminƒ´ya or TalavakƒÅra- BrƒÅhma·πáa , which has as yet hardly been accessible to any one else; and from them I have excerpted all the noteworthy verbal forms and (less completely) the primary derivatives; thus verifying and occasionally correcting the material of the Lexicon, supplying chance omissions, and especially filling in not a few details which it had not lain in the design of that work to present in their entirety.
As a matter of course, no such work as the present can pretend to completeness, especially at its first appearance. The only important texts of which we have exhaustive verbal indexes are the ·πög-Veda and the Atharva-Veda, nor is it known that any other is in preparation: and only where such indexes exist can the inclusion of all that a text contains be assured. But I trust it will be found that the measure of completeness here attained is in general proportioned to the importance of the material: that it is the more indifferent forms and derivatives which , having been passed over hy the Lexicon, have escaped my gleaning also. I expect to continue the work of verification and addition, and to make an eventual future edition perceptibly nearer to perfection in its details, and possessing such improvements in plan as my own experience and the criticisms of others may suggest. It is unnecessary to add that corrections and aclditious of any kind will be welcomed by me, and duly acknowledged.
Of the verb-forms which, though not yet found - and, for the most part, destined never to be found - in recorded use, are prescribed or authorized by the Hindu grammarians, a liberal presentation is made under the different roots: such material being always distinguished from the other by being put in square brackets. It is in no part given at first hand, but only as reported by Western authorities: the Lexicon , Westergaard‚Äôs Radices , and the various European grammars: all of these supplement rather than contradict one another: and any occasional disagreement among them is passed over, as relating to a matter of too little consequence to be worth reporting.
The periods in the life of the language which are acknowledged and distinguished by appropriate notation are six: the Veda (marked with v. ) , the Brabmarya (with b. ), the earlier or more genuine Upani·π£ads (with u. ), the S≈´tras (with s. ), the epics, MahƒÅbhƒÅrata and RƒÅmƒÅya·πáa (with e. ), and the classical or common Sanskrit (with c. ). This classification, however, is by no means an absolute one, and calls for certain explanations and limitations, as follows.
Under ‚ÄòVeda‚Äô (v. ) are included only the indexed texts of the ·πög-Veda, SƒÅma-Veda, and Atharva-Veda. In strictness, certain passages of the Atharva-Veda should have been excluded, as being in prose and BrƒÅhma·πáa-like; and, what is of much more importance , the older and better part of the mantra-material in the various sa·πÅhitƒÅ‚Äôs of the Yajur-Veda, in the BrƒÅhmat·πáas, and even in the S≈´tras, is quite as good Veda as most of the Atharvan, some of it even as parts of the Rik. In the present condition of things, however, it did not seem to me practicable to draw the division-line otherwise than in the partly arbitrary way in ‚Äúhich I have drawn it. When the mantra-material is collected from all places and compared (as it by all means ought soon to be), it will be possible to use the term ‚ÄòVeda‚Äô in a more exact sense, both inclusively and exclusively - though between what is genuinely old and what is in an artificially antique style a definite separation will probably never admit of being made.
It is further to be stated that in the following lists nothing is intended to be marked with simple v. , as ‚ÄòVedic‚Äô, that does not occur in the ·πög-Veda; what is not ·πög-Vedic, though it may be found in both the other collections, is marked av. , or sv. , or both, as the case may be. On the other hand, if anything occurring only in the ·πök among the three Vedas is found also in later periods, the fact that it does not chance to be met with in the Atharvan or SƒÅman is too unimportant to notice, and (save perhaps in exceptional cases) it is marked v.b. or the like.
Between BrƒÅhma·πáa, ƒÄra·πáyaka, and Upani·π£ad, again, the line of division is an evanescent one, and perhaps hardly worth the attempt at drawing. But I have followed the method of distinguishing by a u. the small number of these treatises that have an existence separate from BrƒÅhma·πáa or ƒÄra·πáyaka, while not distinguishing the two latter from one another. The sign u. is the one of least importance and least frequency in the system adopted.
The division of S≈´tras (s. ) is a plainer one , except so far as these treatises contain mantra-material in their quoted verses (as already intimated ) - and brƒÅhma·πáa-material also in their quoted formulas. The proper language of the S≈´tras themselves is a true continuator of that of the BrƒÅhma·πáas.
As epic (e. ) are reckoned only the two great poems, the MahƒÅbhƒÅrata and RƒÅmƒÅyana. And in these it has, of course, been impossible to distinguish between the older and the more recent parts: although, beyond a question, a considerable part of both is in no manner distinguishahle from the general later literature, except by a degree of archaizing neglect of the trict requirements of the native grammar.
Everything else that is Sanskrit falls under the head of classical (c. ), or of the language as written under the domination of the native system of grammar. Here the only subdivision which one is tempted to make is to mark separately those forms and words which are found used only in the commentaries, and which are therefore open to a heightened suspicion of artificiality: but this I have not trieel to do.
A plus-sign (+) indicates that the given formation is found to occur from the specified period onward , even to the latest or classical period.
Instead of a period , an individual text is sometimes referred to - yet not upon any very definite and consistent plan (except in the case of the Vedas , as explained above). A ‚Äòsuperior ‚Äò figure (e. g. rv1. ) indicates the number of times a word or form has been met with - yet this, again, only in exceptional instances, and not in the case of every unique or very rare occurrence.
So far as the present- system is concerned , only so many specimen-forms are given as suffice to illustrate the mode of formation. It would have been space and time thrown away to instance in each case the various sub-formations - modes, participles, imperfect - that occur, since one form implies clearly enough the possible existence of the rest. The form taken as representative specimen is ordinarily the 3d singular, as being often more characteristic than the 1st; and that person is even occasionally given when, in verbs of infrequent use, it is not itself actually quotable. Irregular or exceptional forms, whether of the earlier or of the later language, are then added in parenthesis. Everywhere, an appended ‚Äòetc.‚Äô means that other forms of the same make occur : yet I find on review that I have not used this sign consistently, and its absence must not be taken always as indicating more than that the variety of forms quotable is comparatively small. The various modes of present-formation are intended to be given in the order of their relative regularity or frequency: to each is prefixed in brackets the number belonging to it in the order of the conjugation-classes as given by the Hindu grammarians - since, however meaningless and unworthy of retention this may be, it is still widely used, not only in the grammars, but even by general writers on language.
In the other tense-systems, while in the main the same method is followed , the intention nevertheless is to give , on account of their greater infrequency and irregularity, a conspectus of the various tense and mode - formations from the same stem (not, of course , the participles , except for the aorist). Thus , for example , no quotable precative, either active or middle, is designedly omitted under the aorist to which it belongs; nor any quotable conditional under the first future ; nor any pluperfect under the perfect. Moreover, in view of the rarity of the 2d sing. perfect active, and the useless prolixity of the native rules as to its formation, every example of it is given that has been found to occur. The order in which the aorists are presented is the systematic one, without reference to their frequency of use.
Among the verbal adjectives and nouns are included as belonging to the verbal conjugation only the passive participle , the infinitives, and the gerunds (along with that in -am, the distinction of which from an ordinary adverbially used accusative is not always easy to draw); the gerundives are quite too loosely attached to the conjugation-system to be worth treating as a part of it, and they are accordingly relegated to the list of derivatives.
Of the secondary or derivative conjugations , only examples enough are given to show the form of the stem - unless, indeed, some unusual or irregular forms are met with, in which case they are duly noted. To cite, for example, the innumerable futures and verbals of the causative conjugation , or even its perfects , all of them made upon precisely the same pattern, would have been wholly useless. The causative aorists, however, since they are made directly from the root, are of course put along with the other aorists, save in the exceptional cases where they actually come from the causative stem (as ati·π£·π≠hipat, bƒ´bhi·π£as, etc.). All the tertiary conjugations, not omitting even the common causative passives (any others are quite rare), are noted so far as found.
In the lists of derivatives are given not only those of genuinely primary character, but also those which have come to assume a primary aspect in the language, even though of incontestably secondary origin: such as the gerundives in -tavya and Vedic -tva (from -tu) , and -anƒ´ya (from -ana), the nomina agentis in -in, and the various formations in ya (among which hardly any, if any, are really primary). These are in general placed next after the forms from which they are presumably derived. Apart from this, the order of arrangement intended to be pursued is in the main the alphabetic order of the suffixes, the radical stems or those without suffix standing at the head: but such an arrangement could not be very strictly carried out, nor does any particular importance belong to it, considering how easily the columns may be glanced over to verify the presence or absence of any given formation: and some inconsistencies will doubtless be found. Reduplicated stems are put after the others , and last of all the quasi-primitive formations from (secondary, or rarely primary or tertiary) conjugation-stems. Notation of the period of occurrence is made in the same way as for the verb-forms. A hyphen put before a stem indicates that it has not been found quotable otherwise than as posterior member of a compound ; one following a stem (much more rarely) shows it to occur only as prior member of a compound, or in derivative stems or in denominative conjugation.
Throughout the whole work, accent-signs are applied only where the word is found actually so marked in accentuated texts.
It is, of course, impossible to draw the line everywhere between the derivatives of a root and words that do not belong to it; since etymology is from beginning to end a matter of balancing probabilities: and thick-set with uncertainties and chances of error. It has been my intention to err rather upon the side of liberality of inclusion than the opposite - and certainly I have in not a few cases put under certain roots words as to whose connection with those roots I have great misgivings: but doubtless also there are words omitted, by oversight or by failure of judgment, which ought to have been included. All such errors, it is hoped, will be viewed with a reasonable degree of indulgence, considering the novelty and the extreme laboriousness of the undertaking. Its main intent is to furnish the means of examining in their chronologic entirety the groups of words and forms that cluster about the so-called roots in Sanskrit, that they may be studied, and have their relations determined, with more complete understanding: and that intent will be gained in spite of minor omissions and inaccuracies. Regarding it as primarily an assemblage of materials for study, I have not hastened to anticipate the results of comparison by penetrating behind the aspect of things as shown in the Sanskrit language itself, or to reduce the materials to an Indo-European basis and form of statement. A few intimations as to the more obviously probable connections of certain roots are given in brief notes at the end of exposition of forms and derivatives.
The representative form of the roots is naturally that adopted in the grammar to which this work is a supplement. Although loath to differ from the Petersburg lexicon upon such a point, I cannot regret having adopted the ·πõ instead of the ar or ra-form (e. g. k·πõ, k·πõp. instead of kar, krap) of the many roots exhibiting both elements in their forms and derivatives. So long as we speak of the Sanskrit root vid, and not ved, so long, it seems to follow that we ought to speak of the root v·πõt, and not vart, whatever may be the Indo-European value of the root in the one case or in the other. The meanings added after the roots by no means claim to be exhaustive: they are in general intended only to identify the root.
As a matter of course, not a few matters of doubtful classification present themselves in connection with the verb-forms, of which the scope of the work does not allow a discussion. Such are here and there noted by a question-mark. The classes of forms that contain the most puzzling problems are the reduplicated ones , and the present stems ending in ya: upon these no new light has been thrown since the publication of the author‚Äôs Grammar, in which the difficulty of their treatment was noticed.
In the indexes of stems given at the end of the volume, a classification is adopted which is intended to facilitate the historical comprehension of the language, by distinguishing what belongs respectively to its older and to its later periods from that which forms a part of it throughout its whole history. It may be added that the manuscript left the author‚Äôs hands complete in July, 1884: the delay in its appearance is owing to his distance from the place of printing and publication.
I desire to express my obligation to Professor Lanman for kindly aiding the accuracy of the work by giving the proof-sheets an additional revision.

W. D. W.After Snowboard Big Air was added in this year's Olympic games, skiers were wondering when our chance to spin & win for our countries would come along. It turns out 2022, in Beijing, is our answer.
In addition to Big Air Skiing finally being added to the Olympic games repertoire, the IOC is looking to equal out gender participation with "more female athletes and women's events than any other Olympic Winter Games, with female quota positions increasing from 41% to 45.44 %."
Sure, it's almost 4 years out at this point but who do you think will take home the first ever gold in ski big air? Do you even give a shit about the Olympics? Let us know below.>>

A little girl plays with a stuffed animal on her cot at the Portland Expo. Asylum seekers have been living there for nearly two weeks.The group exhibition ‚ÄúThe Racing Will Continue, The Dancing Will Stay,‚Äù curated by Leo Li Chen and presented by Guangdong Times Museum, took China‚Äôs reform and post-reform era as its starting point. Showcasing works that delve into this period of societal transformations, which saw the rapid development of China‚Äôs entertainment industry, athletics, and urban infrastructure, the show investigated how individuals navigated the balancing act between their own identities and that of collective society amid such shifts.
The center of the gallery accommodated works that explore theatricality. New Neighbour (2019), Li Ran‚Äôs newly commissioned installation, is an open, two-level stage, replete with inbuilt staircases and props such as a mop, trashcan, and coat. In the absence of performers, Li invites viewers to take the stage and act out his script. Adapted from He Jiping‚Äôs 1984 drama Good Fortune Building, Li‚Äôs play includes a series of domestic conflicts that occur within a building in Hong Kong. While He‚Äôs script argues that the city‚Äôs adoption of capitalism led to alienation and inequality among its people, Li investigates the differences between individuals, and the frustrations that the households in this building share. He allows participants to embody the perspectives of different characters, and thus closely consider the dynamics of capitalist societies. Another immersive work was Yao Qingmei‚Äôs three-channel video installation Molt (Body Inspection) (2017). In the left projection, a female dancer performs a striptease, while a security officer‚Äîsymbolizing censorship‚Äîenacts robotic movements as part of what is meant to be a ‚Äúsecurity check‚Äù on the right. The screen in the middle shows a choir‚Äîsimilar to the chorus in Greek plays‚Äîsolemnly singing the line ‚ÄúBig Brother is watching you.‚Äù During a pause, the performers across all three screens stare at the audience, creating a sealed, panoptic environment where the viewer is scrutinized by the collective.
The body was further foregrounded in works concerned with sports. Clustered in one section of the gallery, these artworks probe how individuals wrestle against uniformity. Xin Yunpeng‚Äôs two-channel video installation documents a group of secondary school students practicing boxing during an annual military training camp, while Gao Lei highlights the vulnerability of the body by fashioning parallel bars used in gymnastics‚Äîoften a part of military exercises‚Äîout of the nylon material that is used to make prosthetic limbs, in G-350 (2013). Both works reflect on how an individual‚Äôs body can be disciplined for a specific function through repeated training. In the same section, Wang Bo‚Äôs installation shifted the focus to the internal struggle of an athlete. The Orbit (2019) recreates the Los Angeles hotel room that the professional tennis player Hu Na was staying in while competing for the 1982 Federation Cup. During the tournament, Hu decided to leave the national team and seek political asylum in the United States. Wang‚Äôs installation delineates how Hu‚Äôs freedom was gained through her departure from the orbit of the collective, at the cost of her never being able to return home.
The displays at the gallery‚Äôs opposite end examined how individuals have made personal spaces for themselves within the nation‚Äôs landscapes. Chen Wei‚Äôs An Advertisement About the Future (2019) depicts the clich√©d slogan ‚ÄúBuilding Your Future,‚Äù seen in numerous real-estate advertisements. The installation was juxtaposed with Chen‚Äôs ‚ÄúS‚Äù (2018), a photo of a spiral staircase in a partially deconstructed Beijing building. The decrepit scene is a reminder of how property developers fail to fulfil people‚Äôs expectations of a better life, and instead build lies and illusions.

Sorry, there are no recent results for popular commented articles.For a diverse range of businesses that need or want to verify a customer‚Äôs identity prior to completing a transaction ‚Äì financial service providers, conveyancers, lawyers, credit bureaus, retailers, travel agents and so forth ‚Äì verifying customer identities has been a painful experience for all involved.
Customers are often forced to submit documents in person during work day or join the lengthy queues at their local post office. Business owners would then spend considerable time tracking and receiving these documents, processing and then storing, destroying and returning them as required.
However, technologies currently being rolled enable customers' identities to be verified remotely ‚Äì at the click of button.
‚ÄúWe offer a very pragmatic opportunity for businesses to improve their customer onboarding experience at reduced risk and cost,‚Äù explains Stuart Hosford, managing director in the virtual ID provider, e4 Australia.
‚ÄúThis is a unique proposition given that customer conve
nience and regulatory compliance are most often not complementary in their objectives. What is currently a convoluted and lengthy process will become a seamless digital experience that can be completed in five minutes or less, from anywhere with an internet connection.‚Äù
While the Australian arm of e4 has only been launched and is focusing its efforts initially on residential mortgage applications, Mr Hosford says the global e4 group already operates in a wide range of sectors.
How does virtual verification of identity (VOI) work?
As Mr Hosford explains, virtual VOI is essentially a three-step process:
Step 1: the business, as the one wanting to verify a customer‚Äôs identity, schedules and initiates a call on the customer‚Äôs mobile or tablet.
Step 2: during the call, the customer provides consent for photos to be taken of themselves and their relevant documents by the business. This is done through the e4 platform, rather than the device itself, meaning personal information is not stored on the device‚Äôs camera.
Step 3: the business authenticates the location of the device and initiates a biometric facial match and authentication of the supplied documents, using a range of official sources. This is all completed during that one phone call.
What are the benefits of virtual VOI?
According to Mr Hosford, there are several key benefits that come from virtually confirming identities compared with the traditional, manual method. These are:
‚Ä¢ Reduced risk and enhanced compliance ‚Äì particularly important for financial service providers
‚Ä¢ Better record-keeping potential for the business
‚Ä¢ Convenience for the customer
‚Ä¢ Reduced cost for both parties
What does virtual VOI mean in reality?
While other companies operating in virtual identity checks span a range of sectors, Mr Hosford says that e4 is specifically looking to partner with brokers and lenders (apart from the big four banks) to simplify the application for residential mortgages.
‚ÄúBrokers are striving to do some of this already, but leaving themselves quite exposed when they do anything of this digitally because they have no proof of record, so this is something that adds value to them immediately,‚Äù he explains.
‚ÄúThe fact that then we can connect with lenders and they will consume this in the process and make it two weeks shorter (because you aren‚Äôt waiting for the customer to do their identity verification) is great for them. They know that they will get the commissions quicker, the customer will be happier, and it‚Äôs a better experience all round. So, the response from broker and aggregator has been hugely favourable.‚Äù/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69178492/Screen_Shot_2021_04_23_at_6.03.29_PM.0.png)
On Friday, The Shirt committee unveiled the 2021 version for the Notre Dame Fighting Irish football season. It‚Äôs green, and has many, many graphics ‚Äî but more on that in a minute.

So let‚Äôs get this fashion critique started...
Color
This year‚Äôs version is green ‚Äî as it should be each and every year. I have no real problem with the exact color, although it is a lot more seafoamy than kelly green. Last year it was a dark forest green. Again... green is good, but for the love of St. Joseph can someone finally make the decision to go with ONE shade of green? As a brand, Notre Dame has actual rules for this shit.
People will still buy the same color shirt as one or two or three of what they already own ‚Äî it‚Äôs not going to force a dip in sales.
Front
The front is actually not terrible this year. Of course they‚Äôre going to put one of the many ‚Äúsayings‚Äù of Notre Dame on it, because somehow that particular thing is in the recipe. It‚Äôs cheesy ‚Äî too cheesy, and you should never have more cheese than the actual food on the plate. Flip the Notre Dame Football and Strong and True around in size and placement and it‚Äôs a better product.
Back
Hideous ‚Äî and a god damn lie. First, the sheer size of the graphic is why these things always look like they were designed by and for Wal-Mart. It‚Äôs a terrible look. Insert another Notre Dame saying/quote per the recipe (which is a bad recipe) and now we are truly cooking with actual gas which is never a smart idea ‚Äî it tastes funny. I loathe back graphics anyways, but these things always find a way to make them worse. Michael Mayer looks like he‚Äôs getting a little too fresh with Joe Wilkins, and why in the hell is the grass longer than what we had against the USC Trojans in 2005 on there? And yeah ‚Äî nice gothic window frame.
Sleeves
Is there room for more graphics? There is? On the sleeves? COVER THEM UP! I get why, but again... it isn‚Äôt a good look, ever.
Overall
Don‚Äôt like at all. In fact ‚Äî I like it less and less the more I look at it. But... charity and all that jazz. It‚Äôs more of the same, and will never be great because people just buy whatever Notre Dame puts in front of them.

Today, over 70 percent of Americans claim they use social media. As the number of social media users has grown, so has social media marketing in 2018 or SMM.
According to the ‚ÄúState of Social Media 2018‚Äù report prepared by Buffer and Social Media Week, marketers use certain social media platforms more often than others. Here is a breakdown of the social platforms marketers use most often and the percentage of marketers that use each of them:
- Facebook: 96 percent
- Twitter: 89 percent
- LinkedIn: 70 percent
- Instagram: 70 percent
- YouTube: 57 percent
- Google+: 33 percent
- Pinterest: 33 percent
- Snapchat: 11 percent
Similar to how marketers tend to use different social media platforms more often than others, they also use different platforms for paid advertisements more frequently. Again, Facebook is the social media platform of choice in this regard, with 94 percent of polled marketers using Facebook for paid ads. Instagram is used by 44 percent of marketers for paid advertisements. With 26 percent of marketers using LinkedIn and Twitter, those two platforms are tied for third when it comes to sponsored ads.
The ROI of Social Media Marketing 2018
In the past, many businesses measured the return on their investment in social media in the contexts of leads, sales or both. Now, a growing number of businesses are emphasizing engagement to measure their ROI from social media. In fact, 42 percent of businesses of all sizes measure the ROI of their advertising campaigns on social media using engagement. Just 17 percent of businesses measure ROI using leads and only 15 percent use sales to gauge their social media ROI.
The Rise of Social Messaging Apps
With the organic reach of social platforms like Facebook on the decline and the popularity of social messaging apps continuing to increase, it‚Äôs impossible to discuss the current state of social media marketing without talking about messaging apps. The leading four social messaging apps are WhatsApp, Messenger, WeChat, and Viber while the top four social media apps are Facebook, Instagram, Twitter and LinkedIn.
Today, more people are using the top four messaging apps than the leading social media apps. While that‚Äôs the case, only 20 percent of businesses use messaging apps for marketing purposes. To have success with social media marketing in 2018 moving forward, it‚Äôs likely that marketers will have to rely on social messaging apps at least in part to engage with their audience. Luckily, social platforms such as Facebook are expected to monetize messaging apps, which will create more opportunities for marketers in the future.
Changing Content
While images and links are number one and number two respectively when it comes to the type of content businesses share on social media, videos and stories are becoming increasing popular choices. Approximately 85 percent of businesses plan to share more video content this year. About 68 percent of marketers plan to create more stories on Instagram and Snapchat during 2018.

Predatory payday loans:
- trap borrowers in high-cost debt
- drain income and damage credit
- could be offered on HBCU campuses under new agreements
Defenders of the payday lending industry use the term "access to credit" to make the argument that payday loans provide communities of color with financial services that have historically been denied them. But payday lending is a faulty form of credit and a poor substitute for fair and responsible financial services.
Rather than help borrowers through financial challenges, as they are marketed to do, payday loans block and destroy access to good credit options. They trap borrowers in high-cost loans, drain their income, damage their credit, and often worsen their financial situation.
Students at Historically Black Colleges and Universities are targeted
Payday loans are now specifically threatening students of Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCU's). Compucredit, a financial services company, recently made an agreement with three HBCU's that allows the company on their campuses to market high-cost credit products, including payday loans.
HBCU's are a rich symbol of opportunity and a unique resource for African-Americans in the continuing struggle for civil rights and economic independence. HBCU students typically work their way through college without benefit of family wealth. Many are the first or second generation of their families to earn college degrees, and in doing so must overcome the deeply-rooted disadvantages imposed by a racially-stratified society.
For HBCU students, payday loans represent grave dangers. One is the draining of income that is vital to the student's ability to pay for their education. Another is credit so damaged as to jeopardize the student's financial stability far into the future.
Wealth gap makes African-Americans more vulnerable to predatory lending
A recent Pew Research Center report describes a wealth gap of almost 15-to-1 between white and black households. The median net worth of white households was $88,651 in 2002, while for African-American households, it was $5,988. Almost one third of African-American households had zero or negative net worth in 2002. ("The Wealth of Hispanic Households: 1996 to 2002," Pew Hispanic Center, October 2004, p2.)
Families who have a cushion of assets may use them to manage emergencies, as Thomas Shapiro argues in his book, "The Hidden Cost of Being African American." (Oxford University Press, 2002, Ch1) Those who don't have a cushion, who need short-term loans to help them with unusual expenses, are being targeted for predatory loans instead of being offered helpful financial services.
Borrowers are trapped in payday loans
These short-term payday loans typically require a post-dated personal check as collateral, and are marketed as quick cash for a short-term emergency. But they are the worst offenders when it comes to harmful, as opposed to helpful, credit. Only one percent of all loans go to one-time emergency borrowers. ("Quantifying the Economic Cost of Payday Lending;" Keith Ernst, John Farris, and Uriah King; Center for Responsible Lending, February 2004.)
Payday loan terms typically allow the borrower just two weeks to repay the loan, and flip the borrower into new paperwork when they cannot pay it off in full, collecting for the lender another fee of over 400% APR each time the loan is flipped. There are many more payday borrowers trapped in loans than there are occasional users ‚Äì ninety-nine percent of payday loans are flipped. Payday borrowers often cannot escape the cycle of debt without seeking legal advice or filing bankruptcy.
"Access to credit" claims ignore abusive design of payday lending business model
Payday lenders base their business model on revenues from these trapped borrowers. CRL research shows that borrowers who enter five or more transactions per year account for 91 percent of payday lenders' business. So payday loans are not only exorbitantly priced; they are a carefully designed trap ‚Äì a faulty form of credit that hurts borrowers instead of helping them.
While payday lenders claim they are providing access to credit, the credit they offer serves to continue a long history of economic injustice for communities of color.
In the case of HBCU campuses, the damage will follow hardworking students into their adult lives, blocking their access to credit that is helpful, and denying them the financial security that has been so elusive for African-Americans. Exposing students of Historically Black Colleges and Universities to this menace is a new and insidious way of targeting people of color.
Access to credit must mean access to fair, responsible credit. African-American students and families need opportunities to borrow and spend safely, and to build wealth as a foundation for a solid economic future.SEARCH BLOG
Students start in different beginnings and meet in the same industry
The programs take a few months to a few years to complete, but the knowledge and skills learned last longer. Many of the graduates from the School of Communications, Media, Arts and Design have achieved careers in their field. You may be familiar with some of them, as they are active in the news, both delivering the news content and making headlines for their great work.
Alumni stories vary but they all come down to their past experience at the college, where they had a good learning experience, mentored by faculty members, and completed hands-on training at Centennial‚Äôs media and design labs and through internships. They credited their early experiences at Centennial, for which they have been very grateful for the teachings learned and connections made.
Let‚Äôs take a look at some familiar faces in the broadcasting and media industry. These three alumni have years of experience in front of the camera but graduated from different programs at Centennial. Broadcasting and Film graduate George Tsioutsioulas has his own show, The Hospitality Guide. He put a lot of work and hours to get to where he is today. He says, ‚ÄúI decided if I couldn't be a rock star, then I could interview them." He has since interviewed A-list celebrities and gone to write, produce, and host shows at OMNI, Global, W Network, APTN and the Biography Channel. Another alumnus in the industry is Liz West, a graduate of the Public Relations and Corporate Communications program. Her career path has taken her to be the face of many popular shows, co-host of big events, and guest hosts of shows like Breakfast Television and Cityline. She has been the Entertainment Specialist in CP24, Citypulse @ 6, the Host of "Star! At The Movies," and the Entertainment Reporter for "Star! Daily." The third alumni in the industry comes from the Journalism program. Kris Reyes worked as a TV news reporter at CityTV and news anchor at Global Toronto‚Äôs The Morning Show. She credits Centennial for giving her the opportunity to gain an internship at CTV.
Centennial students have a lot to learn from past graduates, but their work serves as an inspiration to many.

Well recommended toner with vitamin E, which enhances aging skin. It also balances the color of the skin and eliminated any skin blemishes. This is good for both men and women at any age. I always believe that to slow down skin aging, we need to start skin care at mid 20's. The price is very affordable as well and worth it‚Ä¶ Read Full Review

By default
With no changes, Cspect does support making TCP/IP requests and emulates a small subset of ESP AT commands, such as
AT+CIPSTART,
AT+CIPSEND=... etc.
The big gotcha is that all data is encoded as 7-bit.
This is important because if you're working with ASCII text like a protocol like gopher, then everything will work fine. However, if you're sending raw 8-bit bytes over a socket, Cspect will corrupt the data. For example, if the server sends
0xFF it will be corrupted to
0x7F.
However, there's also no logging so debugging can be especially hard. This is where Robin Verhagen-Guest's github repo comes to the rescue.
Enabling 8-bit bytes
The UART replacement Cspect plugin replaces Cspect's own implementation and, from my own experience, makes the ESP communication near identical to the Spectrum Next's own comms. However, you will need your own ESP module attached to your development machine (in my case, my Mac).
The directions are very simple to follow once you've download the plugin zip file:
Download the CSpectPlugins.zip file, then extract the UARTReplacement.dll and UARTReplacement.dll.config files. Exit CSpect, then copy these into your CSpect directory
Now you need to plug your ESP module into the machine you're working with. I used this specific adapter and it worked with zero setup: OPEN-SMART USB To ESP8266 ESP-01. Of course, you'll also need an ESP-01. You can find these on Amazon (a pack of 4 for ¬£12) or 87p on AliExpress (if you're happy to wait).
You will need to discover the port that the device is connected to. On Windows this is typically
COM1 but it's worth checking your devices to be sure. MacOS is a little trickier, but typically can be found using
ls /dev/tty.* (though
/dev/cu.* might also work). Take note and use this in the
UARTReplacement.dll.config.
This is my own MacOS config file:
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?> <Settings xmlns: <PortName>/dev/tty.wchusbserial1420</PortName> </Settings>
Using Cspect now will pass the requests directly to the ESP which gives you a much closer experience to the Spectrum hardware.
Logging
Again, Robin's repo solves this problem. In the same zip file is the UART Logger. Again, drop this into your Cspect directory and now all ESP comms are logged (by default) in the Cspect directory in a file called
ESPLogFile.txt.
The result is all the back and forth communication between the ESP and the software:
Final background reading
I'd also recommend reading around the ESP itself to understand some of it's quirks, since the actual hardware can host different versions of the AT commands - with that in mind, I personally recommend sticking to the lowest common commands - usually just
CIPSEND.
I did write up my braindump on ESP modules which could be useful follow up reading.2

As Ottawa steps up efforts to detect and deter fraud in its billion-dollar COVID-19 personal income support programs, some Canadians say their benefit payments have been on hold for weeks due to delays in the government‚Äôs identity-check process.
‚ÄúI‚Äôm feeling extremely anxious, ‚Ä¶ like I don‚Äôt know how this is gonna go,‚Äù says Paul, a master‚Äôs student at the University of Ottawa, who says he hasn‚Äôt been able to collect his Canada Emergency Student Benefit (CESB) since mid-June.
Read more: CERB poses back-to-work dilemma ‚Äî ‚ÄòWe‚Äôre being incentivized to make just under $ 1,000‚Äô
When Paul ‚Äî whose real name Global News has agreed not to use ‚Äî logged online to re-apply for the CESB, a bright blue banner on the dashboard of his Canada Revenue Agency (CRA) account told him to call a validation and identity protection service line, he says.
But despite speaking to three different agents in the following week who said the CRA would follow up to verify his identity, Paul says that still hasn‚Äôt happened. Five weeks later, his application remains blocked, he says.
‚ÄúI wonder how many thousands of people are like me, just sitting there wondering, ‚ÄòWhat the hell?‚Äô‚Äù
Paul, who lives with several mental health disabilities, says he‚Äôs counting on the federal aid to make up for income lost due to the coronavirus pandemic.
Read more: One quarter of Canada‚Äôs small businesses report staff refusing to return to work, survey suggests
He was transitioning out of school into working in the mental health sector when the pandemic hit, and nearly all of his work went up in smoke, he says. He first applied for the student benefit program in May and received the maximum $ 2,000 amount because of his disabilities.
The May payment helped pay the bills, Paul says, and after his work barely picked up in June, he decided to apply again. But as he awaits the fate of his second payment, he‚Äôs stretching out what‚Äôs left of the first.
Global News agreed to use a pseudonym for Paul because he keeps his disabilities private and worries they might impact his career prospects.
Many others claiming to be applicants or recipients to the CESB or the Canada Emergency Response Benefit (CERB) have reported similar delays and concerns about the CRA‚Äôs validation and identity line on social media.
Ottawa resident Joe Doucet, for example, says the system blocked him from re-applying for the CERB for the same June 7 to July 4 pay period.
Doucet, a tech support worker who says he lost work in March due to the pandemic, says he had applied for and received the $ 2,000-per-month benefit for the previous three pay periods without a hitch.
Read more: Finance minister reveals changes to COVID-19 wage subsidy program
Doucet says it took more than a month to resolve the issue, despite dialling up the CRA validation line every single day starting on June 10.
Initially, calling the government‚Äôs 1-800 number would connect him with agents who would take his name and telephone number and promise a callback, he says.
‚ÄúFirst it was within two to five days, then three to 10 and then they stopped giving time frames,‚Äù he says.
Concerns about identity theft, organized crime
The reports of payment delays come after the federal government increased efforts to weed out fraudulent applications from its CERB and CESB programs, which the Finance Department expects will cost taxpayers more than $ 85 billion.
When it rolled out the programs, Ottawa opted for attestation-based applications, with the system designed to automatically approve funding, in an effort to quickly deliver emergency funds to millions of Canadians left without income amid the pandemic.
Federal officials said applicants‚Äô eligibility would be reviewed later, suggesting they weren‚Äôt worried about high fraud levels.
But concern about scams has increased in recent weeks. In June, the CRA told a House of Commons committee it had already detected a number of potentially fraudulent applications for benefits, including from people believed to be involved in organized crime.
‚ÄúThe CRA recently implemented controls requiring certain applications to be validated before they are processed,‚Äù the agency told Global News in a statement, confirming it launched the toll-free validation and identity protection service line in early June.

Canada‚Äôs federal tax agency faces a difficult job trying to come up on the fly with a system to prevent a potentially significant outflow of funds to criminal entities while at the same time ensuring that all legitimate applicants can access the benefits they‚Äôre entitled to in a timely manner, says Elizabeth Mulholland, chief executive officer of Prosper Canada, a national charity that focuses on improving economic opportunity for Canadians living in poverty.
Read more: Wage subsidy to be extended to December, Trudeau says
On the one hand, the government needs to act quickly to combat the criminal activity, Mulholland says.
‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not about catching somebody who is $ 100 off on how much they received,‚Äù she says. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs about making sure that we‚Äôre not hemorrhaging tens, if not hundreds, of millions of dollars due to a systematic effort by organized crime to tap the system while it‚Äôs still fairly open.‚Äù
Waiting until tax time next year to conduct in-depth reviews of applications for individual pandemic-aid programs would likely be too late to recoup any funds lost to organized crime, she adds.
Read more: Canadians facing CERB gap receive explanation via government email
On the other hand, the government must make sure legitimate applicants aren‚Äôt cut off from funding for prolonged periods of time when they may have no other way to pay the bills, Mulholland adds.
‚ÄúPeople are relying on these payments to pay their rent and buy food in many cases,‚Äù she says.
‚ÄúWe really do need to make sure that we‚Äôre not harming honest Canadians while we go after the crooks.‚Äù
Normally, the CRA relies on algorithms to flag potentially fraudulent benefit applicants, says Mulholland, whose organization has helped the CRA address issues around fraud detection in the Canada Child Benefit program.
‚ÄúTypically, you would tweak your algorithms over time, as you realize, ‚ÄòWe cast the net too broadly. ‚Ä¶ We‚Äôre catching too many people who are not doing anything wrong‚Äô,‚Äù Mulholland says. But that‚Äôs a difficult, time-consuming process, she adds.
Read more: Can your employer really cut your pay for working from home?
‚ÄúModest review of claims should be feasible at the application stage while maintaining efficiency for all applicants,‚Äù says Joseph Devaney, director of VideoTax.com, a national tax educator for accountants, in an email to Global News.
The speedy processing of claims reviews requires direct phone lines to CRA agents, adequate staffing levels, clear reviewing instructions for agents, and the ability to easily access support, Devaney says.
‚ÄúIf CRA can provide these pillars, I don‚Äôt see why a moderate amount of application stage review couldn‚Äôt take place efficiently,‚Äù he says.
CRA acknowledges jammed phone lines
In a statement to Global News, the CRA acknowledged the toll-free validation line ‚Äúhas, at times, been receiving higher volumes,‚Äù and that some callers haven‚Äôt been able to get through as a result.
‚ÄúIn other cases, we may not have been able to respond in a timely fashion to some callers, who were expecting a callback from us,‚Äù CRA spokesperson Etienne Biram said in the statement.
‚ÄúWe are diligently working to adjust this service to ensure applicants can receive timely and efficient service, without the need to call back.‚Äù
Read more: Canadians facing CERB gap receive explanation via government email
The CRA wouldn‚Äôt say how many of its agents are assigned to the identity validation line, but said it has ‚Äúadded additional phone lines and more employees to increase our capacity to process files more quickly.‚Äù
When callbacks are required, the agency said it ‚Äúprioritizes the work based on the applicant‚Äôs situation‚Äù and some applicants may receiving their follow-ups more quickly as a result.
The agency wouldn‚Äôt say how many identity validation checks remain to be done for people who applied for the June 7 ‚Äì July 4 benefit pay periods.
In a previous statement to Global News, the CRA confirmed the validation phone line is operated by the agency and not by a third party.
The CRA has said it has received several thousand fraud-related tips for three federal COVID-19 emergency aid programs.
Early in June, the Liberal government was unable to get unanimous support from the opposition parties to pass legislation that included fines and possible jail time for CERB fraud.
‚ÄòIt made me feel like I was the bad guy‚Äô
Paul and Doucet both say their experience with the validation system has left them feeling like they are being accused of cheating the system.
Doucet says he finally got through to an agent on July 14. He says he‚Äôs been told his account had been flagged because he had recently updated his banking information. The flag has now been removed, he adds.
He says he understands the CRA is trying to prevent and catch fraudulent claims but wishes he hadn‚Äôt been left ‚Äúin the dark‚Äù for so long.
‚ÄúWithout knowing what I know now, it made me feel like I was the bad guy,‚Äù Doucet says.
Paul is still waiting for his June monthly payment and says he still doesn‚Äôt know why his account was flagged as ‚Äúsuspicious,‚Äù as he claimed he was told by a CRA agent.
He feels ‚Äúreally let down‚Äù by a program that was promoted as the government‚Äôs way of having Canadians‚Äô backs during a difficult period.
‚ÄúThere‚Äôs no transparency. There is no accountability. I can‚Äôt get anybody on the phone,‚Äù he says.
‚ÄúIt feels like a bait and switch or a dupe or something.‚Äù
He says he‚Äôs not going to rely on the emergency benefit again, even though business is still slow and he hasn‚Äôt figured out yet what to do once the CESB money is gone.
‚ÄúNo matter what, I‚Äôm never applying again.‚Äù

>Jonathan Cabral wanted a shot at Taft of Woodland Hills‚Äô DJ Morgan at last year‚Äôs state track and field meet, but the Agoura High standout couldn‚Äôt get past the first obstacle on his way to the championship heat of the 110-meter hurdles.
Cabral clipped a hurdle in the first qualifying heat and fell, missing an opportunity to run against Morgan, who ran 13.59 seconds the next day to win the state title.
A motivated Cabral ‚Äì undefeated this season in the 110 and 300 hurdles ‚Äì returns today to Buchanan High in Clovis not only looking to atone for last year‚Äôs disappointment, but to challenge Kevin Craddock‚Äôs 2004 state 110 hurdles record of 13.39 seconds.
Cabral captured Southern Section Masters titles in both races May 28 at Cerritos College, but had to do so twice in come-from-behind fashion. As a result, his 110 time of 14.11 seconds ranks fourth among the 26 entries and his 300 mark of 37.29 is second among the 27 qualifiers.
‚ÄúI know I have to pick it up a level,‚Äù said Cabral, who boasts season-best marks of 13.58 in the 110 hurdles and 36.83 in the 300 hurdles.
‚ÄúThey were going out fast and I went out fast too, but I didn‚Äôt get out fast enough. I have to be able to keep up my speed for both races.‚Äù
Another challenge facing the junior is the prospect of running four races in two days, should he qualify for both championship heats.
‚ÄúI didn‚Äôt feel that tired after the 110s (at Masters), but I don‚Äôt know how I‚Äôm going to do that,‚Äù Cabral said. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm going to have to get used to recovering a lot faster.‚Äù
Taft‚Äôs Jeshua Anderson is the last area runner to capture a state title in the 300 hurdles, clocking a then-national high school record 35.28 ‚Äì lowered to 35.02 last year by La Sierra of Riverside‚Äôs Reggie Wyatt ‚Äì at the 2007 final.
Rio Mesa‚Äôs Jordan looks to join elite company
Jamison Jordan is the top seed in today‚Äôs 100-meter dash prelims following his 10.52 effort to capture the Masters title. The Rio Mesa of Oxnard senior is looking to join a strong quartet of local sprinters to win state 100-meter titles after the distance was modified from 100yards in 1980.
Taft‚Äôs Quincy Watts won with a 10.49 in 1987, Notre Dame of Sherman Oaks‚Äô Justin Fargas captured the crown with a 10.52 in 1997, Taft‚Äôs Jamere Holland prevailed with a 10.54 in 2005 and Notre Dame‚Äôs Rodney Glass was victorious with a 10.52 in 2006.
Jordan is also trying to lead the Spartans to the 400 relay title, joining Notre Dame‚Äôs 41.27 in 2006. The Spartans qualified second in 40.97.
Leading the charge
Along with Jordan, Harvard-Westlake of Studio City‚Äôs Amy Weissenbach (800) and Simi Valley‚Äôs Liberty Miller (3,200) are also top qualifiers.
Highland of Palmdale‚Äôs Jessica Davis is seeded second in the 100 (11.66) ‚Äì ahead of RioMesa‚Äôs Valexsia Droughn (11.68) ‚Äì and 200 (23.72), along with Oak Park‚Äôs Melissa Skiba in the 3,200 (10:22.77) and Burbank‚Äôs Greg Dotson (1:50.38) in the boys‚Äô 800.Drywalling Hectorton & Ext, assisting with installations and repair!

Well the truth is that (as I have said before), I think I passed a 10 year creativity plateau that I finally see fading away.

I just wanted to share that. Don‚Äôt know why. Maybe because the pictures accompanying this post are bright. Maybe because I wanted to make a parallel comparison with the bottom of the empty pool and its white walls as a sort of a ‚Äúblank paper‚Äù that forces me to use it.

Earlier this month a meteorite fell from space, crashed through the roof of Ruth Hamilton‚Äôs house in Golden, British Columbia and landed in her bedroom directly on the pillow beside her head. The event occurred at 11:30pm on October 3 and thankfully Hamilton wasn‚Äôt injured.
She awoke with the sound of her dog barking and ‚Äúthe next thing was just a huge explosion and debris all over my face,‚Äù Hamilton recalled in an interview with CBC. ‚Äú‚ÄùI jumped out of bed and turned on the lights. I didn‚Äôt know what else to do, so I called 911.‚Äù
It was while on the call with the operator that she noticed a black rock, about the size of a large adult fist, lying on her pillow. At first she surmised it was debris from a construction site on the TransCanada Highway nearby but after speaking with the RCMP officers who were dispatched to her house, she learned there hadn‚Äôt been any blasting or an explosion that night. ‚ÄúBut the workers had seen a meteorite, or a falling star, explode and there was a couple of booms.‚Ä¶ Then we knew that it was a meteorite that had crashed through my roof,‚Äù Hamilton said to the CBC.
According to Peter Brown, a professor of physics and astronomy at Western University in London, Ontario, the chance of a meteorite landing on someone‚Äôs pillow is ‚Äúone in about 100 billion‚Äù but after seeing photos of the rock, he confirmed it was from space. ‚ÄúEverything about the story was consistent with a meteorite fall, and the fact that this bright fireball had occurred basically right at the same time made it a pretty overwhelming case.‚Äù He and his team believe it‚Äôs from our solar system‚Äôs main asteroid belt but are asking anyone with security or dashcam footage of a fireball over the Golden area around 11:30pm PST on October 3 to send the video their way.
Once the researchers have finished their work over the course of the next month, Hamilton says she plans to keep the rock. Because it landed on her property, it legally belongs to Hamilton and she wants it as a souvenir. Her grandchildren also think it‚Äôs pretty cool.

By why is mentorship important?
Why is mentorship Important?
I was fortunate as a child to have my extended family living nearby. Not only was I blessed to have parents who loved and cared for me, but my aunts, uncles, grandma, and grandpa were also hugely instrumental in my life. As a teen, a dear woman named Marge spoke into my life about the love of Jesus. I am thankful for those mentors in my life who took the time to come alongside me.
When we take the time to mentor others, we show them that we care. That we are there through the difficult times, and that we are committed to helping them become the best they can be.
Mentoring makes a difference in every life. No matter what our age, if we have someone invested in our lives, it makes an impact for the better.
Anyone can be a mentor, but an effective mentor is an encourager, they are available, and they set a good example.
Life can be challenging. Mentors see the end result, not the here and now. They help the one they mentor to achieve those goals that are important to him or her.
We all need a mentor.
In our church, I have mentors whom I look up to ‚Äì godly women who are examples in their knowledge (and application!) of God‚Äôs Word, the way they love their husbands, and the way they truly care for others. Most of these women are much older than I am. They have life experience and are mature in their faith.
My teen daughters and I have had many great discussions about who they would turn to (besides my husband and me) if they were going through a difficult time. Brainstorm with your kids some godly adults that they could call upon if times were tough. Someone they look up to, can be honest with, who will pray for and with them, and who will provide wise counsel.
When we mentor someone else, we help shape their lives for the better.

Regular charge card pay day loans don‚Äôt require a checking account. Sort of. It‚Äôs complicated. If you need that loan, your options become a great deal narrower if you don–≤–Ç‚Ñ¢t have a bank account. You can–≤–Ç‚Ñ¢t write a check without one, nor is it possible to head to an ATM. Plus, many loan providers which can be payday nonetheless need you‚Äôve got really a vendor account before they–≤–Ç‚Ñ¢ll lend for you personally. an advance loan might be an alternative solution, but could you will get one with no banking account? The answer allow me expose –≤–Ç¬¶ perhaps. To begin with, this can rely in what you recommend by –≤–Ç—öcash advance. –≤–Ç—ú
An advance loan is a mode of charge card deal. Instead of use that is making of card to simply make a purchase, you should utilize a money loan in your card to obtain paper money. The amount that you withdraw is likely to be placed into your total security, the way that is exact exact same the cost of a transaction that is ordinary.
Besides the money you receive, pay day loans change from normal credit card deals in three important means. First, numerous cards charge a extra expense for taking out an advance loan. Typically this expense is something like –≤–Ç—ö$5 or 3percent for the volume withdrawn, whichever is greater. –≤–Ç—ú consequently straight away, you ought to invest to get cash insurance firms an advance loan.
2nd, payday advances tend not to add a pursuit elegance duration that is free.
With traditional purchases, there is typically an one month display between when the purchase is established when the purchase volume starts accruing interest. Meaning that when you‚Äôre able to spend that stability down in complete prior to the elegance duration finishes, it is possible to avoid spending any additional costs.
Nonetheless with pay day loans, that interest begins accruing right away. Between that interest along with the loan price, there–≤–Ç‚Ñ¢s simply no real option to prevent extra cash this is certainly additional. Plus, the eye costs for pay day loans are really a complete great deal more than the interest charges for regular discounts. If you–≤–Ç‚Ñ¢d like to just you need to a cash loan call at your charge card, it will run you. (fed up with relying on payday advances for crisis costs? Check always away our blog post: Saving ways of Avoid a High Interest payday loan. )
Can you obtain a credit card without a bank account?
The thing that makes we asking this concern? Well, its because it also includes the middle of why giving an answer to this relevant concern could be therefore tricky. See, while charge cards advance loan doesn‚Äôt have a bank account, you–≤–Ç‚Ñ¢re probably like to a banking account to have that bank card inside the accepted spot that is first. Theoretically, the clear response is yes. In truth? It–≤–Ç‚Ñ¢s a no.
You don–≤–Ç‚Ñ¢t have a bank account, you–≤–Ç‚Ñ¢re going to be away from fortune if you–≤–Ç‚Ñ¢re trying to find a normal unsecured charge card. Almost all charge cards will likely require that you have a bank account before they–≤–Ç‚Ñ¢ll approve you. Devoid of a banking account is a massive red advertising for them it indicates you–≤–Ç‚Ñ¢re greatly predisposed to not ever repay everything you borrow. If you can–≤–Ç‚Ñ¢t just take a charge card away with out a checking account, and that means you won–≤–Ç‚Ñ¢t allow you to geting an advance loan without one either.
You‚Äôre getting an advance loan with a secured credit card or debit card that is prepaid.
People who don–≤–Ç‚Ñ¢t have bank documents can however make application for a secured credit card. Together with your cards, a money is created for you personally by you deposit into a merchant account that the card issuer opens up. That cash volume then determines your borrowing restriction. So a $500 deposit shall suggest a $500 limitation. You could then use this secured credit card just to just take straight down a loan.
But this arrangement raises problem: Why is it possible to make usage of secured charge card to merely you need to take a cash loan out when you could merely utilize the cash that you already deposited to start within the card? Well, the possibilities are excellent which you most likely have credit that is bad you–≤–Ç‚Ñ¢re in this example. Having a credit this is certainly guaranteed and making your instalments on time is a superb choice to raise your credit score up such a long time considering that the card company reports into the credit scoring agencies.
While secured charge cards normally have greater fees ( perhaps not mention more costs) than mainstream bank cards, using some of those is a lot better than exactly what is doing cash. Using one properly can raise your credit rating after a while, ultimately leading that you a card with much better advantages and paid down prices.
You could subscribe to a prepaid debit card to just just take straight down a advance loan. The funds are packed straight on your card; the amount of money is yours to spend, without any interest accruing after all with your items. You possibly can make utilization of one of these brilliant cards at an ATM to obtain cash but it–≤–Ç‚Ñ¢ll probably include far more charges as compared to typical standard advance loan would. Plus, unlike guaranteed in full credit cards, a prepaid debit card won–≤–Ç‚Ñ¢t enhance your credit. (to see more about additional options to traditional banking, check our article down: just how to endure in a Banking Desert. )
Some –≤–Ç—öcash advance–≤–Ç—ú loans don–≤–Ç‚Ñ¢t need a bank account.
Keep in mind at the beginning of the time on this page if we talked about payday loan? Those are short-term, high interest no credit check loans that are created to easy and quick however in trade, they are a great deal more high priced than a day to day unsecured loan, and they–≤–Ç‚Ñ¢re aimed at those that have really poor credit ranks. The typical term for a payday loan is something like a few weeks, having a annual part price (APR) of 350per cent.
Here–≤–Ç‚Ñ¢s the benefit that is plain of time loans: many of them promote by themselves as –≤–Ç—öcash advance–≤–Ç—ú loans. Despite the fact that numerous payday improvements do require you to have checking account, there are many that don–≤–Ç‚Ñ¢t. Numerous bad credit loans will direct deposit your funds in to the bank bank checking account, but pay day loans that don–≤–Ç‚Ñ¢t require a banking account will either control you cash or will position the money on a debit card that is prepaid.Raywat Deonandan is feeling more hopeful these days, and he‚Äôs noticed a renewed optimism in many of his epidemiology and infectious disease colleagues.
After months of observing negative COVID-19 trends, Deonandan is ‚Äúfilled with joy‚Äù to see cases, hospitalizations and deaths declining in most of Canada while vaccination rates climb to new heights.
Canada‚Äôs rollout reacheda major milestone on Saturday with 50 per cent of its overall populationat least partially inoculated, though 58 per cent of the country‚Äôs adult population had received at least one dose as of Friday.
The 50-per cent marker won‚Äôt have immediate impact on plans to re-open services or lift public health restrictions, but Deonandan says it signifies a new, more encouraging era of the pandemic in Canada.
And the psychological impact of that can‚Äôt be ignored.
‚ÄúIt is a milestone,‚Äù the epidemiologist with the University of Ottawa said. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs like: Hey, we as a society have passed an important point in this marathon and we can almost see the finish line.
‚ÄúAnd even though we‚Äôre all tired, we‚Äôre going to sprint to the end together.‚Äù
An increase in Canada‚Äôs vaccine supply pushed the national rollout from sluggish to supersonic over April and May, with a rolling average of more than 370,000doses administered per day last week.
That, coupled with an apparent willingness from Canadians to get their jabs ‚Äî some have lined up for hours in rain or snow outside pop-up clinics ‚Äî has Deonandan hopeful for what the summer could look like.
‚ÄúIt means people want to get out of this, and they want to do their part to get out of it,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúSo I‚Äôm very optimistic and I think a lot of scientists watching the numbers are optimistic as well.‚Äù
The immunization drive has helped decrease transmission, Deonandan says, but lockdown measures and restrictions have played a key role as well.
And while optimism is warranted, experts add caution is required in this in-between phase while half of Canada‚Äôs residents still aren‚Äôt protected from COVID-19.
Health Canada has said it would like to see at least 75 per cent of eligible Canadians ‚Äî those 12-years-old and up ‚Äî vaccinated with one dose and 20 per cent fully inoculated before measures are relaxed. Less than five per cent of Canadians had received both shots as of Friday.
Deonandan says vaccination numbers alone won‚Äôt dictate when to re-open. Case numbers, hospital and intensive care admissions, test-positivity ratios and the reproduction rate (how many people one positive case is expected to infect) all need to drop.
Keith Dobson, a psychology professor at the University of Calgary, says Canada‚Äôs rollout has increased his optimism that life within the country could return to relative normalcy soon. But there‚Äôs work yet to be done.
Dobson says reaching the 50 per cent threshold is psychologically similar to getting a second wind after the midway point of a race, or noticing positive changes in your body after working out for months.
‚ÄúWe know from studies of human behaviour that as people get closer to a goal, typically their energy goes up, and that‚Äôs what we‚Äôre seeing,‚Äù Dobson said. ‚ÄúThe key, of course, is not to burn out before you get there. So we need to keep working hard to achieve our goal.‚Äù
Some countries are closer to their targets than others.
The United Kingdom, which had 55 per cent of its residents at least partially vaccinated as of Thursday, is set to relax more restrictions next week, including allowing small indoor gatherings of up to six people between two households.
The United States, meanwhile, recently released guidance for fully vaccinated individuals that included relaxed mask policies in some indoor areas. While the U.S.‚Äôs overall vaccination rate is now slightly lower than Canada‚Äôs, a higher percentage of Americans are fully immunized.
Deonandan says the epidemiological trends around the globe offer a model for what‚Äôs to come.
‚ÄúIt means (vaccination) works. We‚Äôre on that path to be those countries,‚Äù he said.
Steve Joordens, a psychology expert with the University of Toronto, says vaccines have renewed hope for many.
Still, Joordens says, it might be difficult for some to be optimistic after experiencing cycling periods of lockdowns and surging COVID-19 numbers over the last 15 months. The potential threat of new vaccine-resistant variants is another anxiety-provoking unknown, he adds.
But with vaccines reaching more individuals daily, Joordens says the present situation feels different than past waves. And he senses a level of cohesion among people not seen since the early days of the pandemic.
‚ÄúThis (50 per cent milestone) is an important number because it‚Äôs like: ‚ÄòOK, there‚Äôs more than half of us now,‚Äô‚Äù Joordens said. ‚ÄúThe majority of us are marching the same way.
‚ÄúSo it does kind of give us a sense of how well the team is working to defeat this virus.‚Äù

He quickly became the best employee at the restaurant he worked at due to his fantastic work ethic. He carried this with him throughout everything that he did.
‚ÄúIn high school, I was great with numbers. I excelled in Math class and quickly developed a passion for such. I decided to go to college for Mathematics at the University of Arizona. In order to pay for college, I took a job as a server at a local steakhouse to make ends meet. Having the work ethic that I did, I quickly became a top employee at my job.‚Äù Cody recounts.
During one summer, he got involved with a Sports Handicapping contest. He made a name for himself by doing well in the contest he was partaking in. As he got more involved in the business, he realized how successful he was at it. He was able to make millions of dollars in the span of just a few short months.
‚ÄúIn the Summer of 2016, I entered into a Sports Handicapping contest with 100+ other big names in the industry. I immediately made a name in the industry when my proven and profitable bankroll system allowed me to take 1st place for the most units profited in the tracked handicapping contest. Shortly after, I decided to drop out of college. I gave up everything I had to make a name for myself in Las Vegas. In six months, I turned a $5,000.00 bank roll into $1,000,000.00 profit. I accomplished this all by the age of 22. I never looked back.

Geography of Maldives.
General Information about diving.
Types of diving in Maldives
The underwater relief of Maldives is very varied. It offers many different types of diving and different regions of the archipelago offer different experiences. So let‚Äôs see the relief in detail.
Channels (Kandu). The best channels that I‚Äôve tried are Fotteo and Golden Wall, Vaavu Atoll. It was during my Azalea Cruise diving trip.
Faru
Faru is a reef that surrounds the atolls. It is often just below the surface or can reach a few meters deep. It often sticks out during the low tide. Faru diving is often a drift-dive. The most interesting sites to my mind is Madivaru Corner, near Rasdhoo. There I dived twice (during my daily diving trip to Rasdhoo).
Giri and Thila
Giri is separate from the island reef the summit of which can be seen from the surface. Thila generally has a submerged summit between 15 and 30 meters. Giri pinnacles are accessible to all divers whereas thilas are often reserved for the more experienced divers. The best example of giri is Kuda Giri Wreck, Maafushi (as you can see on the map above).
Best time for diving in Maldives
Many divers ask ‚ÄúWhat is the best diving season in the Maldives?‚Äù First of all you must understand that Maldives has only two seasons: the north-east monsoon and the south-west monsoon. The word monsoon in this context does not mean torrential in the western..! I was lucky to see ‚Äúat least‚Äù 60-70.
It should be mentioned that it‚Äôs allowed only to snorkel there because the diving is prohibited since 2012. What is more south as well as the deep south is not the best place for a liveaboard diving at this time of the year.
The north-east monsoon from December to April is for many reasons the most popular season globe. from the deep south where the temperature can go down to 24¬∞C during the north-west monsoon).
Marine life of Maldives
It is impossible to start this section in any other way than to dive straight into what every visitor to Maldives wants to see: manta rays and whale sharks.
Manta Rays
Maldives is a home to the largest population of manta rays (Manta alfredi) in the world with an estimated 5000 to 7000 individuals!.
Sharks
Besides manta rays, it is possible to see the biggest fish in the world ‚Äì whale shark (Rhincodon typus). It sizes from 6 to 7 meters. So far more than 200 whale sharks have been identified and are regularly seen according to the data by provided by Maldives Whale Shark Research Programme.
They will generally be observed to the south of the Ari Atoll ( the islands of Dhigurah, place.
Unfortunately most of these sites are available during diving safari only.And
And finally, let‚Äôs talk about night diving with sharks. The most popular site for this activity is believed to plenty of divers. So there could be up to 50 divers at a time!Among more than 600 species of exotic
Among more than 600 species of exotic fishes you may spot barracuda which is usually coming up in shoals, tuna, napoleon fish, parrot fish, the variety of moray eels, lion fish and many others..
It is also quite common to unearth some magnificent species of nudibranch and flatworms, many of which are widespread in the region.Besides manta rays, you may also see mobula rays, eagle rays, sting rays etc. The former are usually fed near resorts and even on the local islands sometimes. You may dive with a great amount of sting rays at a site between Hulhumale (the airport island) and Sheraton Full Moon. Although it‚Äôs clear that they come to be fed there still it‚Äôs a very impressive experience!

Diving from liveaboard, island-resort or local island?
If you would like to dive on Maldives, there are several options available to you: the liveaboard, known locally as a ‚Äúsafari boat‚Äù, staying and diving from an island hotel (resort island) or opting for a guest house on a local island with a diving center. Let‚Äôs consider advantages and disadvantages for all of the options.
Diving Liveaboard
If diving is the main reason for your trip to the Maldives then I strongly advise you to choose a liveabord.
My personal experience you may read here.
Today liveaboards are extremely comfortable and many are akin to floating hotels with all possible facilities.
You will be able to visit the perfect dive site at the ideal time for the given sea conditions and seasonal variation. Each dive will be different and you will be able to dive up to three times or four times a day (when you have a night dive) and the longest one is up to 14 days. The longest trip starts in –≤ Hanimaadhoo (north) and finishes in Addu City (deep south).
Diving packages
Besides diving experience, you will also get to visit some of the resort islands and dine on a sandbank or an uninhabited island somewhere in the middle of the ocean.
If you choose liveaboard diving I recommend that you gain some diving experience of at least 30 dives and have a certificate not lower than PADI AOW before you come. That is because many of the dives will take place in currents and in waters about 25-30 meters deep.
As for the disadvantages, this experience can end up quite pricey. It costs about 1800-2200$ per person for a 7-day trip on a nice boat. The cheapest possible is around 1200$
Diving from Island Resorts
If diving is not necessarily the sole purpose of your holiday then you will probably be better placed at an island resort where a large variety of activities will be on offer such as water sports activities, fishing, visiting local and uninhabited islands, etc. staff are trained to provide first aid if any incident happens during diving (even decompression chambers are installed on some of the resorts). local islands
Diving from a local island in the Maldives is the cheapest..

Closer inspection will often reveal aphid colonies on the undersides of the disfigured leaves and you may also notice lots of small ash-like aphid skins that have dropped on to lower leaves. Aphids secrete honeydew as they feed, this drips on to lower foliage causing it to become sticky.
The honeydew also becomes covered with dark sooty mould that blocks out light, often causing premature leaf fall. Note: It is important to read manufacturer‚Äôs instructions for use and the associated safety data information before applying chemical treatments..

That means that everything you send, from your name to your email address, could be hijacked by anyone with even the most rudimentary hacking knowledge.

Anyone who is a parent will be able to confirm that there is a point in their life where they think that they would love for their little ones to stay children for the rest of their lives. Yet for one couple from Brazil, such a wish had come true. The family has been living their life as if taken straight from the ‚ÄúThe Curious Case of Benjamin Button‚Äù movie but with a twist. And all because their daughter is a 40-year-old woman who is stuck in the body of an infant. Who is Maria Audete and what exactly has happened to her? And could this all have been avoided? Read on to find out her story!
Maria Audete - A Woman Trapped In An Infant‚Äôs Body
Maria Audete do Nascimento was born on May 7th, 1981. Her family consists of her father and his second wife, who has been caring for the little woman-child ever since her own mother died 13 years ago. They live in a mud house in Ceara, Brazil, as that is all the family is able to afford. Though of course, the most unusual thing about the 40-year-old is that her physical, mental, and cognitive development had stopped when she was only nine months old. Read on to find out what her life looks like.

Maria Audete - Problems She Faces
Maria had spent the entirety of her life living like a baby, unable to tend to her own needs, and unable to even speak. Even though she is 40, Audete still needs to eat like a baby, otherwise, she could end up dying. It‚Äôs all because her body is not designed to digest hard-to-digest foods and in addition to all this, her tiny heart, which is as developed as that of any other 9-month-old baby, maybe not be able to handle the increase in cholesterol.
Maria Audete - Still Ages
When it comes to doing other things such as talking and communicating, that too has stopped the development of an infant. Maria is able to communicate with her loved ones by making simple sounds. Though while it might not look like it at first glance, the woman has begun to age. As it was reported by local media, she suffers from chronic fatigue and her hair has begun falling out. However, those who don‚Äôt know her, still treat her like a child. They give her candies, carry her in their arms and entertain her, and apparently, the 40-year-old woman enjoys it very much. Though what has caused this woman to be like this? You will find out on the next page

Maria Audete - The Diagnosis
And unlike with Benjamin Button, there was no turning back of a clock but a rather logical explanation for why this 40-year-old has been stuck as a nine-month-old infant all her life. As it turns out, the woman was born with hypothyroidism and in her case, it was all caused by a deficiency of T3 and T4 hormones during the fetal period. And because of this, the autoimmune disease led to neurological and developmental complications which had stopped Maria from developing physically, mentally, and cognitively at the age of nine months old.
Maria Audete - This Could Have Been Avoided?
Though as experts have revealed, Maria‚Äôs life could have been very different from what it is today had she been diagnosed on time. Had she been given the right medication at birth, the physical changes to her body could have been reversed and she would have lived out her life like any other person her age. Though unfortunately, the girl was not diagnosed until she was eight years old which meant it was too late for hormone therapy and so she will continue to live out the rest of her life the way she is now. But could anything change? Read on to find out!

Maria Audete - Help For The Woman
Experts from the Faculty of Medicine at the University of Ceara were the ones who have made the diagnosis that the then-8-year-old Maria was suffering from a severe deficiency of the thyroid hormone. However it wasn‚Äôt all, the university staff had also agreed to, free of charge, provide treatment to Maria to enable her to be a little more independent such as teaching her to walk, eat and say a few words. Though besides that, there is not much they can do to help her.
Maria Audete - A Loving Home
As we have mentioned earlier, Maria‚Äôs mother had passed away 13 years ago, and later, her father had remarried. And it seems that the house the 40-year-old lives in is not short of love because her stepmother Dora, has taken care of Audete since the day she married her father. The woman also doesn‚Äôt mind the fact that she needs to look after her all the time as she believes that it is the passion of her life and that the child was sent to her as a gift of God, for her to take care of. Though there are other cases of children who have never aged. Read on to find out what they were

Gabby Williams - Outlived Her Prognosis
Although much different to Maria, in 2014 a news story went viral about Gabby Williams, a nine-year-old baby who will never grow old. Gabby lives in American with her parents and five siblings and despite being the second-oldest child, she is the smallest. When she was born not only was she purple and limps, tests also revealed that she had a brain abnormality and that she was blind. In addition, she had two heart defects, a cleft palate, and an abnormal swallowing reflex which meant she had to be fed through a tube in her nose. When all chromosome tests came back negative for well-known genetic condictions, doctors had no idea what Gabby‚Äôs problem was and told her parents to expect the worst. Though when her parents had taken the girl home, she started to get stronger and her condition stabilised. Yet as weeks and months passed by she hardly developed or grew. Eventually, doctors told her parents that Gabby‚Äôs rate of ageing was much slower than other children, yet the most bizzare thing was that there are no known genetict conditions or abnormalities to explain the disorder that affects just a handful of people in the world...so rare that it doesn‚Äôt even have a name
Brooke Greenberg - Lived Until 20
The condition that Gabby had suffered from has been so rare it didn‚Äôt have a name so that some people had been referring to it as Syndrome X or Benjamin Button disorder. Another girl who suffered from this was Brooke Greenberg. Back in 2009 everyone was about the girl who had been pushed in a stroller all her life and when her family was interviewed on ABC‚Äôs ‚Äú20/20‚Äù that year, she had weighed only 16 pounds and was 30 inches tall. She didn‚Äôt speak but at times laughed and showed recognition for her family. The only part of her body that grew was her hair and fingernails. Her first 6 years of life saw Brooke go through a series of medical emergencies from which she suffered without an explanation. They included surgery for seven perforated stomach ulcers, a brain seizure that was followed by what was diagnosed as a stroke. At the age of 4, she fell into a lethargy that caused her to sleep for 14 days. Then doctors had diagnosed a brain tumor, prompting the Greenbergs to purchase a casket for their daughter, but then doctors called saying she was fine, awake and that there was no tumor. However, in a sad turn of events, Brooke had passed away in 2013, at the age of 20, never having developed beyond the physical size of an infant or the mental capacity of a 2-year-old.

The Los Angeles Dodgers brought with them the best road record in all of baseball and no slouch in Hyun-Jin Ryu, who took the mound with a 6-1 record away from Chavez Ravine.
The Dodgers hit Verlander hard in the first inning, scoring five runs on four hits with Juan Uribe‚Äôs two-run home run on an 0-2 count after fouling off pitches to stay alive. With the Dodgers still leading 5-0, Torii Hunter led off the second inning for the Detroit Tigers with a single off the right field wall.
All in one motion, Puig positioned himself to field the carom off the wall, spun and delivered a perfect strike to second base to nail Hunter on his attempt to stretch the single into a double. While Hunter was ruled out, the play would be reviewed and overturned.
It wound up being the beginning of the end for Ryu as he allowed five runs in the inning and the Tigers went on to rout the Dodgers.
Nonetheless, it was an impressive play by Puig that would‚Äôve been another highlight to add to his collection if Miguel Rojas had applied a better tag.

Intel Pre-x86 Architecture
1971: Intel 4004 Microprocessor
Designed originally for calculators, this processor was one of the major developments in the history of Intel. As Intel's first CPU, it was an impressive finish.
- Intel Pre-x86 Architecture
- 108KHz - 740KHz
- 2,300 transistors
- 10um
- No cache
- 4 bit
1972: Intel 8008 Microprocessor
Designed as the first home processing unit, the 8008 performed "twice as fast" as the 4004. The main difference is the clock speed and the number of transistors. At this point, Intel was not so focused on improving the fabrication technology.
- Intel Pre-x86 Architecture
- 200KHz
- 3,500 transistors
- 10um
- No cache
- 8 bit
1974: Intel 8080 Microprocessor
The 8080 was the first computer processor for hobbyists. This CPU meant that people who had an interest in this could build their own computers easily. The 8080 did not come cheap, however.
- Intel Pre-x86 Architecture
- 2MHz
- 6,000 transistors
- 6um
- No cache
- 8 bit
Intel x86-16 Architecture
1978: Intel 8086 - 8088 Microprocessor
The processor was sold to IBM as part of their new Personal System range. Its success was due to the success of the PS system. The problem was that Microsoft refused to program for the processor because of lack of compatibility and it eventually lost IBM and Microsoft's alliance.
- Intel x86 - 16 Architecture
- 5MHz - 10MHz
- 29,000 transistors
- 3.2um
- No cache
- 16 bit
1982: Intel 286 Microprocessor
The start of big success for Intel started here. This CPU meant that computer users had backward compatibility with previous software written for previous processing units. Intel was developing processors very quickly and the size of a single feature in the CPU was halving every time.
- Intel x86 - 16 Architecture
- 6MHz - 13MHz
- 134,000 transistors
- 1.5um
- No cache
- 16 bit
Intel x86-32 Architecture
1985: Intel 386 Microprocessor
This CPU supported multitasking for the first time, i.e. the ability to focus the processor's power elsewhere whenever it was able to. It was also the first 32 - bit CPU, a technology which is still used very much today. Thi s is why the 32 - bit technology used is often called x86.
- Intel x86 - 32
- 16MHz - 33MHz
- 275,000 transistors
- 1.5um - 1um
- 16kB - 64kB cache
- 32 bit
1989: Intel 486 Microprocessor
The 486 was a huge change in the architecture of previous processors - it was able to do mathematics in a separate section of the processor. This, therefore, reduces the workload on the main CPU. The 486 was the first system able to cope with high end operating systems that required coloured displays. It also was the first CPU to support the Graphical User Interface desktop in this sense. It could also address up to 4GB of memory, which can be used by most 32 bit operating systems of today.

Intel P5
1993: Intel Pentium Processor
Intel Pentium MMX
The Pentium was the first step in the major Intel marketing.
The Pentium's P5 architecture was the 5th major development in microarchitectures and led to the later development of the P6 architecture slightly. The Pentium was compatible with Windows 3.1 and the later Windows 95 and Windows 98. Its speed was a serious improvement on the previous processors.
The Pentium also established Intel's range of processors that would continue for years to come, until the abandonment of it in 2009.
This CPU also introduced the MMX instruction set, which made it competitive against VIA and (the smaller competitor of the time) AMD chips. The Pentium did not actually have a direct Celeron sibling, but instead, it was a CPU in architecture all alone. It was also thought that the Intel P5 architecture lead to Intel's Atom architecture, as the energy-saving features found in the Atom were also found in the Pentium. However, this does not make the Atom a direct derivative from the Pentium, more a discrete derivation.

Intel P6
1995: Intel Pentium Pro
Intel Pentium Pro
The first in the server line for Intel, the Pentium Pro, had a redesigned instruction set known to most compilers as the Pentium Pro instruction set.
The major differences meant that it was unable to run older non-Pentium Pro compiled programs and vice versa. This server line featured high cache levels of up to 1MB. The most important feature of this CPU however was the new architecture being based on the P6 architecture. The P6 architecture is also what led to the development of many future microarchitectures. To get a more detailed analysis of the idea of how successful the P6 architecture really was, look at the roadmap at the end of the document.

1997: Intel Pentium II Processor
Intel Pentium II
The Pentium II also featured the MMX technology found in the later Pentium I processors. It was the first processor which could be used for high quality (320 x 240) video decoding.
The processor also was a mainstream processor which brought high-end multimedia to the home computer. The Pentium II also had a brother - its high-end derivative, the Xeon counterpart.
The Pentium II had heat issues well and truly solved whilst at the same time keeping noise and power levels down. There was also a later mobile version of this CPU called Tonga and later Dixon. Both of these CPUs tried to maintain long battery life in laptop computers using them. My first computer family computer had a Pentium II.

- 66 - 100MHz Front Side Bus
1997: Intel Celeron (based on Pentium II)
Intel Celeron I
The initial release of the Celeron in 1997 was based on the Pentium II processor.
The first Celeron CPU was slightly higher clocked than the Pentium seen previously but without any cache memory named Covington. Despite being higher clocked than the Pentium, it was stilled outperformed by it due to the fact it that it had no L2 cache.
The Celeron quickly gained a very bad name for the brand, yet it still sold very well due to the fact that it could easily be overclocked and because it was cheap to buy Celeron based computer systems. Intel released its next Celeron based CPU called Mendocino as the next Pentium II-based Celeron. This CPU was a very powerful performer, mainly due to the fact that it had an on-die Level 2 cache which no other CPU had to this point - including its "higher end" brother, the Pentium II. The main problem with this processor for Intel was that it could easily be overclocked very well and it would outperform their Pentium II, which lost sales for the Pentium II.
The final CPU released in this family would be a 533MHz clock speed with a 66MHz front-side bus.

1997: Intel Pentium II Xeon
Intel Pentium II Xeon
The Pentium II Xeon was a very high-end CPU with 512KB up to 2MB of the cache. The Xeon also brought along more improvements that the Pentium Pro could not such as the energy efficiency breakthrough with the new fabrication techniques.
The new Xeon range was one that would continue for years to come and is Intel's longest-reigning range. As much as this Xeon would replace the Pentium Pro, it did not do so for quite some time, but it did bring the advantage that when compiling for a Xeon based machine, the code would not need the Pentium Pro-based compiler to functionally create the code.

1999: Intel Pentium III Processor
Intel Pentium III
A big shock to the market was the development of the Pentium III. This processor seriously upped the clock rate, pumping it to 650MHz initially and later 1.4GHz.
The MHz range seemed old fashioned once the Gigahertz range of this processor came along. The Pentium III also was the first major commercial success on televisions, with its wide range of adverts featuring the "blue-men". Also to come along with the Pentium III was the large 512KB cache seen previously on the Pentium and Pentium II processors, but also a breakthrough in energy efficiency, allowing just 32W to the highest end CPU.
The CPU was manufactured with the latest 0.25um manufacturing technology but improved to 130nm. It was also able to run in both Slot 1 and Socket 370, using an adaptor that converts Slot 1 to Socket 370, which makes it one of the only CPUs to run in both a Slot and a Socket. The Pentium III also added in the SSE instruction set that is seen in most CPUs of today. The Pentium III also had a mobile and server counterpart.
However, the P6 architecture by this point looked to be going no further in terms of clock speed, and the Tualatin core was very hard to improve in terms of performance.

- 32 bit
- Codenames: Katmai, Coppermine, Coppermine-T and Tualatin
- 100 - 133MHz Front Side Bus
1999: Intel Celeron (based on Pentium III)
Intel Celeron III
The next Celeron in line was the Pentium III edition. This Celeron would be the final released P6 architecture based desktop CPU to be ever released by Intel. It once again had half the L2 cache of it's Pentium counterpart (which made room for the mistake again that if when a Pentium III was produced and half the cache or more failed to function, Intel could claim it was a Celeron). It was initially released with a 128KB cache which would be half of the original Pentium III processors in the low end, making it a quarter of the maximum cache found on the high-end Pentium IIIs.
The first Celeron was based on the Coppermine based Pentium III CPU. Although the energy efficiency in comparison to performance in the early Coppermine Pentium IIIs was a problem, the Coppermine was still a very good performer. The Coppermine processor was later replaced with a double-cache system which would be the equivalent to a lower end Tualatin. This would now feature 256KB of cache, half of that found on the Pentium III model, but still enough to make it a solid performer.
Intel made a serious movement towards energy efficiency at this point in time with the Celeron Tualatin.

- 32 bit
- Codenames: Coppermine-128 and Tualatin-256
- 100 - 133MHz Front Side Bus
Just at about this point, the CRT monitor was beginning to also lose popularity in favour of the more energy-efficient LCD display
1999: Intel Pentium III - M
Intel Pentium III-M
The final notebook based CPU directly based on the P6 architecture was the Pentium III-M. The Pentium III-M had some major differences between it and the desktop version. The first was the feature of Intel SpeedStep. This technology allowed the dynamic changing of the voltage (VCore) and the frequency of the CPU to allow it to reduce the power usage and in turn make the battery last longer.
The CPU also could only support up to 1.33GHz as opposed to the later Tualatin which could go as far a 1.4GHz on the clock frequency. The mobile edition also featured a slower front-side bus of only 100MHz as opposed to 133MHz until it was finally upgraded to the Pentium III-M which featured a 133MHz front-side bus and 512KB cache.
Intel SpeedStep is still featured in Intel mobile processors today.

- 100 - 133MHz Front Side Bus
1999: Intel Pentium III Xeon
Intel Pentium III Xeon
The second Xeon in the family was the Pentium III edition of it.
Based on the Katmai and later the Coppermine cores, it had a single pumped 100MT/s front side speed.
At this time, however, the P6 architecture was unable to compete with its opposition in AMD's line (who had now become quite a big threat to Intel) with their new Athlon processor.
Also, the Pentium III Xeon may have been a good performer for workstations due to its low power consumption, but at the same time, its performance was still not improving directly. Times were moving and competitors were using the Megahertz Myth on its customers, which Intel responded to with the later NetBurst architecture.

Intel NetBurst
2000: Intel Pentium 4
Intel Pentium 4
With the latest and greatest milestone achievements being achieved mainly by Intel with the Pentium series up to the Pentium III, the Pentium 4 was aiming to do exactly the same.
The Pentium 4 made a radical change in the architecture, removing the old P6 architecture which looked to be going no further in terms of clock speed.
The new architecture was to be called NetBurst and the new architecture was not in the slightest bit related to any other architecture made by Intel - it was entirely new. This architecture was so different from all other architectures, such that it was one of the most radical changes Intel ever brought to their CPUs. The idea was that if they pushed for a higher pipeline the performance would increase. This is exactly what happened in Pentium 4.
The first of this CPU was first released in 2000 with the Willamette core with a 180um fabrication process and speeds up from 1.5GHz to 2GHz with base speeds of 100MHz. The early Pentium 4 CPUs had 15 stage pipelines whilst later models featured as long as 31 stage pipelines. The higher pipelining means that the processors can perform more calculations and process more instructions per clock cycle and gives the system a higher clock rate. But it can also reduce the performance as if an instruction has been incorrectly predicted using the branch predictor, the whole pipeline must be flushed, causing it to work from the top - to - bottom again. Intel set the milestone with this CPU again, by breaking the 2GHz barrier.
The later versions of the Pentium 4 were the Northwood core and the later Prescott core, which was available in both socket 478 and socket LGA775.

2001: Intel Xeon (180nm - 130nm)
Intel Xeon 4
The NetBurst Pentium 4 showed that the increase in clock speed was not making it necessarily faster, but was making it more popular.
The Xeon was still currently based on the P6 architecture and one which could not last much longer. Therefore, changes had to be made. The NetBurst Xeon was released with the name Foster with the transistor shrink of 180nm found in the Cascades Pentium III Xeon and was based on the Willamette core.
But in the Intel tick-tock cycle, the Prestonia was released with a shrink of fabrication down to 130nm, at about the same time as the Northwood core was released. The bus speed using QDR (Quad Data Rate) was boosted to 533MHz as opposed to the 400MHz seen previously. The Prestonia also featured 512KB of L2 cache and Hyper-Threading technology. The next in line was the Gallatin core which had an improved cache memory with L3 sizes up to 4MB.

2001: Intel Celeron (based on Pentium 4)
Intel Celeron 4
Just a couple of months before the Northwood core was released in the Pentium 4 market, the Willamette Celeron was released.
The Willamette Celeron was based on the 256KB Pentium 4 which meant that it would have only 128KB of Level 2 cache (given that the Celeron was given half the cache of the mainstream CPU due to defects). The Willamette Celeron was the first Celeron in the NetBurst architecture. Speeds on this early NetBurst CPU ranged from 1.7GHz to 1.8GHz, giving little variety of CPU.
Although the Pentium 4 Willamette did not outperform the Pentium III, the Celeron managed to outperform the Tualatin Pentium III Celerons by a very small margin. Once the Northwood core was released, Intel released a Celeron based on this core. The Northwood core did not outperform the Willamette as far as Intel thought it would. The new core also had problems with heat dissipation in that it was beginning to require more and more to keep it cool. However, unlike the Pentium 4, Intel decided to rebrand the new Celerons when they were released.

2002: Intel Mobile Pentium 4 M
Intel Mobile Pentium 4 M
This CPU had a strangely repetitive name - Mobile Pentium 4 M. Heat dissipation had always been a problem in Intel Pentium 4 CPUs, but the mobile editions were, for some strange reason hit the hardest. Desktop CPUs were consuming more power than any other CPU by this point and producing around 80 degrees of heat. The mobile editions were suffering worse, with up to 100 degrees.
This mobile edition of the Pentium 4 had a thermal design power of 35W, a considerable amount considering they operated only at 2GHz. This was due to a halved voltage. As power is proportional to the voltage, if the voltage drops, so too does the power (P = CV2f). Due to the fact that the Pentium 4 M was built on 130nm technology, the processor was generally quite cool and the 100-degree margin was rarely met save higher-end versions.

2003: Intel Pentium 4 with Hyper-Threading
Intel Pentium 4 with Hyper Threading
The Pentium 4 did have problems. The early Willamette core was a reasonably cool and normal temperature processor with a thermal design power of 60W. When its successor, Northwood, came along the heat dissipation was a problem. However, the Northwood brought out the Mobile Pentium 4 and in turn the Mobile Pentium 4-M. The naming conventions used by Intel made it complex to figure exactly what you were buying and Intel lost money.
Intel later broke the 3GHz barrier with the Pentium 4 Northwood. The thermal design power levels went up to 90W for a 3.06GHz edition of the Northwood core. Serious heat dissipation issues were also occurring of up to 80 degrees for the 3.06GHz core.
Intel had nothing to be proud of by increasing their pipelining to increase clock speed. This is considered the king example of the megahertz myth.
However, the main improvement with the Northwood core was that of Hyper-Threading, i.e. the ability to process two threads at the same time per clock cycle. Hyper-Threading does this by adding two arithmetical processing cores (ALUs) into the CPU and running processes across both at the same time (simultaneously). This was a significant step in the way towards multicore computing.
However, with Hyper-Threading comes double power consumption and a ~25%-40% increase in heat dissipation. Intel felt that it had to keep going, however, and when Prescott was released with Hyper-Threading, the heat dissipation had gone past the 100-degree mark. Power consumption eventually ended up being around 115W, the highest seen in a mainstream processor. Prescott was later released with the new LGA775 socket, which was later used in the Core series. The aim was that it would reduce the power and heat dissipation, but it, in fact, increased both. On the plus side, however, the heat dissipation was solved due to the LGA775's better heat sink collection and alignments. The Prescott core also featured 90nm fabrication and was the last official Pentium 4 for the mainstream market.
Later Intel released the Cedar Mill Pentium 4, which could clock well past 8GHz, but would need extreme cooling. Cedar Mill was created on the 65nm fabrication process. The majority of gamers however did not like the Pentium 4 CPU and did not feel it had a competitive edge over its competitors (particularly AMD's Athlon 64 range). As well as the shift towards the LGA775 socket, the Pentium 4 started the first of the 90nm fabrication, which started Intel's fabrication technology shrink to lead to higher energy efficiency. Intel also developed 64 bit in the Pentium 4, another move that meant that the Pentium 4 was well respected. However, the Pentium 4 reached 3.8GHz before having to give in to the Pentium D.

2003: Intel Pentium 4 Extreme Edition
Intel Pentium 4 Extreme Edition
By this point in time, Intel knew that heat dissipation was a problem with the NetBurst architecture and their processors were not selling as well as they should have because AMD's counterpart was outselling it and outperforming it.
Gamers were not interested in the mainstream Pentium 4, even with Hyper-Threading. This is where Intel's Extreme series comes in.
The Intel Pentium 4 Extreme Edition was a Hyper-Threading enabled processor. It was based on much of Intel's Gallatin Xeon range. The processor had a 2MB Level 3 cache as well as 1MB of Level 2 Cache. However, this was a major problem with heat dissipation in that it increased it several-fold. The Pentium 4 Extreme Edition, therefore, had the highest thermal design power of up to 135W.
The processor was a large failure for Intel, as they were retailing the processor at approximately $1000. This, however, was the start of a new era of successful NetBurst based CPUs and the start of Intel's Extreme Edition series. The Pentium 4 Extreme Edition Prescott 2M XE also had 2MB of L2 cache as well, a boost for most applications, but it ended up being too high latency and eventually slowed the system down. The Pentium 4 Extreme Edition was designed originally as a high-end edition for video editing and gaming, but its ability to cope with all of these applications was outdated due to higher demand from both such as high specification games (as the Pentium 4 only supported as far as PC2-5300 RAM) and high definition video which meant that a push for new technology was required.
That technology would be multi-core computing.

2004: Intel Celeron D
Intel Celeron D
The very early Celeron D processors were based on the Prescott core using the Socket 478 package. The Celeron D was based on Prescott which was already experiencing great problems with heat and power consumption. The Celeron was pretty much the same in this sense. However, due to the halved Level 2 cache, the power consumption during full usage was approximately half of that of the Prescott Pentium 4.
Some people believed the Celeron D was a mistake - adding an additional CPU to Intel's already crowded lineup.
Eventually, the Celeron D changed to LGA775 as the Pentium 4 did, but it did not improve the power usage of the CPU. The Celeron D also came later in a Cedar Mill package which was produced on the 65nm fabrication. The Cedar Mill Celeron D was, like the Pentium 4 Cedar Mill, very overclockable, even as far as 8GHz with extreme cooling. The Cedar Mill edition of the Celeron D also had double cache memory of its predecessor.

Intel Xeon 5
The Xeon based on the Prescott core was released in 2004. They were designed on a 90nm fabrication process. These were the first Intel 64 (IA-64) Xeon CPUs to be released.
Shortly before this release, Intel had just released the Itanium processor and the Itanium 2 processor in a joint partnership with Hewlett Packard. The result was the IA-64 architecture, an extension to the x86 architecture, which resulted in the 64-bit computer industry known as x86-64. The later Xeon processor based on Prescott's NetBurst was a slightly higher performer than the earlier Xeon processors but did have a higher thermal design power. These later CPUs dropped direct support for the legacy PCI-X bus in favour of PCI-E and dropped legacy IDE for the more modern SATA and SAS connectors. These Xeon processors were also the first to feature 1.8V DDR2 SDRAM.

Intel Pentium Extreme Edition
The next processor developed by Intel continues on the same NetBurst architecture, but for the first time introduces multiple cores. It is practically two Pentium 4 Extreme Edition CPUs on one chip manufactured under 90nm and later 65nm. The processor brought dual-core technology to the market, but also kept the Hyper-Threading technology.
The Pentium Extreme Edition is based on the original Pentium 4 and uses 90nm and 65nm technology. It had a 130W thermal design power, the standard for an 'Extreme Edition' CPU, and is generally considered acceptable for such a processor. The early Smithfield XE (two Prescott cores on the one chip in a non-monolithic design) processors were 90nm, but the later Presler XE (two Cedar Mill cores on the one chip) chips were produced with 65nm fabrication technologies. The Pentium Extreme Edition had its core frequency unlocked as well. This powerful CPU looked to many operating systems as though it had four cores or the system had four processors caused by the Hyper-Threading processing capabilities meaning it had two physical cores and within each of those two logic cores (provided by Hyper-Threading). The main issue found with this processor, however, was its lack of mainstream ability. It may have been good for gamers, but pricing meant it was too expensive for the mainstream. Intel had to develop a dual-core mainstream CPU before its competitors did.

The final edition of the NetBurst Xeon was the one with the highest power consumption, requiring 130W but running two cores. The idea was that it would run two cores (almost identical to the Pentium 4 chip) on the same chip. Paxville received the worst reputation for any single Intel CPU due to its high power consumption yet very low performance. The performance per watt ratio was exceptionally low on this CPU.
Dempsey was the final NetBurst Xeon to ever be released. Dempsey was based on NetBurst, but it was a 65nm version of this that allowed for the push of a 1066MHz FSB clock. It was again 64 bit and had a 4MB L2 cache. The two core idea was something that was working well in both the Xeon and desktop line of Intel CPUs.

2005: Intel Pentium D
Intel Pentium D
Intel's NetBurst architecture was slowly beginning to disappear. It was obvious that NetBurst was ready for replacement. Despite this, NetBurst was moving towards a better future in its last moments. Intel had achieved high clock frequencies of 3.8GHz, the Pentium Extreme Edition was now a dual-core Hyper-Threaded CPU, and the Celeron D had covered the low-end market. But, the Pentium D was still to come.
The Pentium D is, effectively, two Pentium 4 processors on the one chip, similar to the Pentium Extreme Edition. It is, once again, based on the NetBurst microarchitecture. While it is dual-core, its Hyper-Threading capabilities have been turned off, leaving that for the Pentium Extreme Edition along with the unlocked core multiplier. The Pentium D was a big hit on its debut. Its increase of 70 million transistors over the Pentium 4 came from the transistor shrink to 65nm. The Pentium D had a TDP of 95W or 130W depending on its model and frequency. Pentium D was the first mainstream dual-core CPU to be released by Intel. Its heat dissipation issues were considered somewhat decent for a mainstream CPU with good cooling, achieving around 78 degrees Celsius. Its multimedia capacity made it an excellent choice for late Windows Media Center and Windows Vista Capable systems.
It was indeed a powerful CPU at the time and took a lot of the issues the Pentium 4 had away.
However, NetBurst's legacy ends here and a new monolithic multi-core architecture lies across the horizon for Intel.

Intel P6 Derived
2003: Intel Pentium M
Intel Pentium M
The first Pentium M based CPU was the Banias core. This core was officially released in 2003, but it did not hit the market until 2005 properly. The Pentium M drops all of the previous NetBurst architecture changes and starts the whole process from the Pentium II-based systems and more likely the Pentium III based.
The discovery happened in Israel where Intel has a large manufacturing and research centre. This centre discovered that the P6 architecture could be improved rather well and could outperform the Pentium 4 based NetBurst, yet being far cooler, quieter and more energy-efficient. By this point, notebook PCs were running on either the really old Pentium III-M processors or Pentium Mobile 4-M processors. The Pentium 4-M did not perform as well as the Pentium III-M, which meant that Intel had to put some research funds into researching why. They did this in their Israel plant, who quickly discovered that the large pipeline installed into the NetBurst architecture meant that it was not performing as well as it could. Also, the Pentium III had more room for more cache memory which could improve performance more than an increase in the frequency of the CPU.
This led to the dropping of the Pentium 4 for mobile applications and the resurrection of the Pentium III, in one way, but instead, the P6 architecture was changed to make it perform better.
The main changes in the architecture can be described very easily. Basically, Intel adapted it to give it a 2 to 5 stage longer pipeline, a faster front-side bus, better branch prediction (as a longer pipeline will need this), a faster base speed (giving clock speeds of up to 2.26GHz on a 16 stage pipeline) and a larger Level 2 cache of up to 2MB. The main reason that the NetBurst architecture was outperformed here is due to the shorter pipeline and better branch prediction and a larger Level 2 cache.
Intel Centrino
Intel also released the Centrino brand, which was the platform that included an Intel Pentium-M (never a Celeron-M, but later Centrino was able to be different CPUs, just to a Celeron), an Intel Wi-Fi card and an Intel chipset.
The first Pentium M named Banias only featured a 1MB Level 2 cache, which was still the same as the Pentium 4 at the time (Prescott) but it was of lower latency than the Pentium 4's cache memory. The Pentium M looked as though it may be the future (to most people) even in the desktop market. The Dothan CPU was released with a higher front side bus of 533MHz and up to 2MB of L2 cache. The Dothan core was also produced on the 90nm fabrication as opposed to the Banias core which was produced on 130nm.

2003: Intel Celeron M (Pentium M based)
Intel Celeron-M (Pentium-M based)
As the Pentium M was released, a budget version of it was also released known as the Celeron M. This was the first mobile-only Celeron to be created, and it was the final un-unified Celeron collection. It was completely based on the 32 bit Pentium M, and to that extent, it was just a Pentium M with half the Level 2 cache. As always, it had half the cache because it was only to be made room for if during the production of a Pentium M there is a mistake, Intel could claim it to be a Celeron, a process known as binning. Little however did anyone know that this architecture would be even further developed.

Intel Enhanced Pentium M Microarchitecture
2006: Intel Core Duo
Intel Core Duo
The Core Duo comprised two cores on the same die, as opposed to any NetBurst CPU which composed two CPUs on the same chip. This meant that the Core Duo is a single die, dual-core CPU (2,1) as opposed to the NetBurst dual cores which are dual-die, dual-core (2,2). This improves energy efficiency, and also speed. The Core Architecture means that there is a shared level two cache on the CPU, not two Level 2 caches. This means that both cores work together and share data, but it also means that data is halved equally. The reason being is that both cores work together, rather than against each other for data and it improves latency and more importantly, reduces bottlenecks. The cores also share the same front-side bus, which means that each core sends simultaneously.
The Core Duo was a more powerful version of the Pentium M, it was the next step in 65nm technology and only consumed 25W. It was also a 12 stage pipeline system. The Core Duo was not 64 bit.
As part of the Centrino platform, the Core Duo took the place of the Pentium M and was launched under the name 'Centrino Duo'

The Core Duo was the first Intel processor to feature in an Apple product and marks the change from the PowerPC architecture developed by IBM for Apple to Intel.

2006: Intel Core Solo
Intel Core Solo
The Core Solo was a defect in manufacturing, like the Celeron. It normally would be priced at around half of that for a dual-core equivalent. The Core Solo is also, like the Duo, manufactured on the 65nm technology. If when a Core Duo is being manufactured and a core fails to work, it is claimed to be a Core Solo, which is why all Core Solos have two cores (but with one disabled).
The Core Solo is also an ultra-low-power processor only requiring around 15W. However, compared with the Pentium D and Pentium M, it is outperformed greatly. The series, however, was seen really only in the mobile computing environment, but it eventually made it to the net top line. It was the direct successor of the Pentium M. The Core Architecture was a significant improvement on performance per watt compared with the NetBurst architecture by lowering the pipeline and increasing the core count, but at the same time, it was not able to cope with high-end applications that NetBurst could perform such as high definition video decoding. This is why the Core Architecture was replaced by its younger brother; the Core 2 Architecture.

2006: Intel Core 2 Extreme
Intel Core 2 Extreme Edition
An early bird in the Core 2 series was the Extreme. Although the Core Microarchitecture is not directly considered a new architecture by most, in the majority of white papers it is referred to as a new architecture due to the drastic changes compared with the Enhanced Pentium M Microarchitecture. The Core 2 Extreme was exceptionally early for an Extreme processor from Intel. The first Core 2 Extreme processors had two cores. The performance level of the Core 2 Extreme gave it the boost that no other CPU had, as its front-side bus and clock frequencies were far higher than any other CPU by Intel or AMD. In addition to that, the Core 2 Extreme had an effective 64-bit address bus which improved performance.
Intel denoted an Extreme CPU with an XE at the end and the Core 2 Extreme followed this convention.
Another move by Intel to improve performance was the move to quad-core CPUs. Intel released another enthusiast product known as the Core 2 Extreme Kentsfield XE. The quad-core edition of this had an unlocked multiplier as well as a high frequency. The Core 2 Extreme quad-core had a thermal design power of 130W. This made this equally as power demanding as the Pentium Extreme Edition on the NetBurst architecture. The Core 2 Extreme was released first as a QX6700. The Q stands for the quad-core and the X for the Extreme Edition and it was clocked at 2.67GHz.
Initially, the Extremes had a 1066MHz front-side bus, with the later editions of this Extreme Edition CPU featuring a 1333MHz front-side bus and core speeds of up to 3.0GHz.
After the Core 2 Quad was released, Intel dropped the enthusiast market for quite a while and needed to bring back the Extreme Edition with the new features found in the later Wolfdale and Yorkfield cores.
The Core 2 Extreme Edition with 45nm fabrication could be found in stock from early 2008 with up to 12MB of Level 2 cache. The 45nm edition was based on the Core 2 Quad's model known as the 9000 series of Yorkfield cores. This CPU again had an unlocked multiplier and a new logo. Along with this, Intel had included VT Technology and SSE4.1 instructions in the CPU.

2006: Intel Core 2 Duo
Intel Core 2 Duo
Although released after the enthusiast edition, the Duo was a success in the mainstream market. The Core 2 Duo was the most accessible multicore CPU on the market at its time and held its reputation for years to come. It was not a success at its initial launch, but in 2007, its real adoption into the market came as no big shock to anyone.
The Core 2 Duo was originally clocked at 1.86GHz with an 800MHz front-side bus. It had up to 4MB of cache, although if a manufacturing defect occurs such as a section of the cache was broken during manufacture, Intel marketed it as 2MB L2 cache version known as the E6300 and E6400 (through the process of binning).
Intel was directly ahead of the competition with the Duo due to the reduced power consumption over competitors. The Duo also outperformed the AMD Turion X2 in the mobile market and the Athlon X2 in the mainstream desktop market. However, the Core 2 Duo was about to meet its match. AMD was working on an FX edition of the Athlon with two cores. This would eventually outperform and end up cheaper than the Core 2 Duo
Intel Centrino 2
As well a releasing the Core 2 Duo, Intel released the Centrino 2 platform, which included a Core 2 Duo CPU, a specific Wi-Fi card and a specific chipset in tandem.
Intel announced a 45nm iteration of the Core Microarchitecture to keep it competitive known by its codename 'Wolfdale', which lead to the renumbering as the E7000 and E8000 series. The Core 2 Duo also got a redesigned logo with the later releases. Finally, this update to the CPU brought two of the most important improvements - SSE4.1 and Intel VT technology or Virtualization Technology.
Wolfdale is also designed with an improved front side bus of 1333MHz and a 3MB or 6MB L2 cache, giving one and two MB of bonus cache to the CPU respectively compared with Conroe and Allendale.

2006: Intel Pentium Dual-Core
Intel Pentium Dual-Core
The first Pentium Dual-Core was on the 65nm fabrication. The processors were a low-end Core 2 Duo based on the Allendale core. It was designed with 1MB of L2 cache instead of the 2MB found on Core 2 Duos under Allendale.
Intel designed it as a lower power consumption edition for notebook PCs as well as the standard 65W equivalent to a Core 2 Duo for desktops. The idea was that again, if the cache fails, Intel can still sell the CPU as a different product.
The Pentium Dual-Core was one of the most successful processors in the dual-core market due to its price and well established Pentium name.
Featuring the 45nm fabrication process, this CPU was able to accommodate a 2MB Level 2 cache system, which in turn boosted performance. This 45nm edition also meant that the CPU was highly overclockable, and Intel released an E6500K edition which had an unlocked multiplier like the Core 2 Extreme Edition making it more overclockable.

The first dual-core Celeron was the dual-core version of it. The Celeron Dual-Core is based on the Allendale Pentium Dual-Core, with just 512KB of Level 2 cache. The CPU is a 65W version like the Pentium Dual Core and Core 2 Duo.
Intel's way of marketing this product was that it was the low end whilst the Pentium Dual-Core was the mainstream processor and the Core 2 Duo is the entry-level enthusiast processor with the Core 2 Quad as the mainstream enthusiast and the Core 2 Extreme as the complete package.
Being completely based on the Core 2 architecture reduced the life of the architecture and made it look very cheap. Intel later released a Wolfdale version of this core which gave it VT and SSE4.1 as it was manufactured using a 45nm fabrication process.

2006: Intel Xeon (65nm - 45nm dual-core)
Intel Xeon 7
The redesign of the Xeon was based on the Core Microarchitecture. This meant that instead of two dies on one chip, there were two cores on the one die. The fabrication change also resulted in lower power consumption.
Before the release of this Xeon, the Xeon family was somewhat out of place. The Core 2 series brought back the Xeon with the first Xeon based on the Woodcrest architecture. However, none of these cores would be possible desktop processors. Despite this, things were changing the desktop processors were just server ones with features disabled.
None of these Xeon processors featured Hyper-Threading seen in NetBurst. Intel came up with an idea to base their Xeon processors on the successful dual-core systems called Conroe, seen in the Core 2 Duo processors. Shockingly, they use the equivalent socket, LGA775 as the Core 2 Duo processors do. This meant the Conroe Xeon was mainly designed for workstation-based computers rather than high-end servers.
They feature EIST and also have Intel VT (Virtualisation Technology) technology. They also only function in a single CPU operation and do not support multi-CPU systems.

Intel Core 2 Solo
Intel's defective/binned CPU due to manufacturing issues within the Core Microarchitecture previously was made by the Core Solo.
Prior to the Core 2 Solo, the Core 2 series had nowhere to fall back to as it could not claim it was a Core Solo if it was not the same architecture. For this reason, Intel designed a fallback processor known as the Core 2 Solo. This was in the case that if one core failed in the Core 2 Duo, Intel could claim it was a Core 2 Solo hence reducing waste.
The Core 2 Solo is mainly seen in notebooks but has also been found in nettops.
Intel's Core 2 Solo was also redesigned when the Core 2 Duo was. This gave it the 45nm fabrication and the VT technology found in the Wolfdale core.

2007: Intel Core 2 Quad
Intel Core 2 Quad
The Core 2 Quad became a new mainstream processor. Although there were initially only two models the Q6600 and the Q6700, the Core 2 Quad eventually started to produce a larger mainstream line. The final 65nm Core 2 Quad was released at 3.0GHz with a thermal design power of 95W in late 2007.
The Core 2 Quad had a significant change in the design to that of the Core 2 Duo. The Core 2 Quad was comprised of two Intel Core 2 Duo processor dies. The result was that the processor bandwidth was lower per core. The four cores work well together - but not as well as if it were a native four-core system.
The Core 2 Quad 65nm was codenamed the Kentsfield core and comprised of two Conroe Core 2 Duo dies on the one chip featuring 2x4MB caches, resulting in a total Level 2 cache of 8MB. A serious problem for the early Quad line was that the CPU had problems with sharing the cache between two CPUs. The Core 2 Quad was a decent CPU but was criticised for its concept of two processors on one chip, or a multi-chip module, which Intel was doing back in the NetBurst Architecture. The Yorkfield core was released in mid-2008. The core featured four cores as standard, but instead of using Conroe or Allendale cores, it was based on Wolfdale cores which gave it the functions of Wolfdale such as VT and SSE4.1. Yorkfield was a minor revision but a serious improvement on the Kentsfield core.
This CPU marked the end of another era for Intel, the end of the desktop Core Microarchitecture but more importantly the end of the Socket LGA775 era, one which lasted for 3 years and through two microarchitectures.

Intel Xeon 8
Intel's success with the Core 2 family meant that the 4 core collection was a success as well. This led to the production of the Core 2 Quad. In turn, the Core 2 Quad led to the quad-core Xeon.
This Xeon was based completely on the Core 2 Quad Kentsfield originally, and later the Yorkfield core. The clock frequencies measure from 2.13GHz to 2.66GHz for the Kentsfield core with 2x4MB caches and a 1066MHz front-side bus. The Yorkfield cores were later based on the exact same cores as the desktop equivalent, with frequencies of 2.66GHz, 2.83GHz and 3.0GHz. The cache sizes go as far as 12MB.
The final quad-core server Xeon in the Core 2 architecture was the Harpertown. The Harpertown was based on the LGA771 package and had two dual-core dies on the same core. It brought the front side bus speed up to 1600MHz.
The final released quad-core Xeon in this architecture was a Core 2 Extreme Edition release, known as the QX9775 which used socket 771 and was able to run a high-end gaming machine known as Intel's Skull Trail. This core in the Core Microarchitecture Xeon collection was called the Dunnington core. This core contained 6 cores, i.e. "Core 2 Hexa" - three dual-core dies on the same chip.

Intel Centrino Atom
The Centrino Atom processor was not much different from its successor, the Intel Atom, but it does meet the Centrino requirements.
The Centrino Atom was ditched because the requirements for the Centrino platform at the time were too broad to continue to call it a member of the Centrino platform.
The Centrino Atom, however, could only be supported for netbooks rather than Mobile Internet Devices (MIDs). For this reason, the Centrino Atom was removed from the Centrino family and instead replaced by the Intel Atom.
Not surprisingly, it outperforms the early Intel Centrino platforms based on the Pentium M 740 Banias.

2008: Intel Atom
Intel Atom
A new mobile CPU was brought out by Intel slightly later than their dual-core Celerons. This processor would be the Atom. The Atom would not perform as well as a Celeron in terms of the MIPS and GFLOPS it could perform, but it would be a cheap and low power mainstream processor and not a budget one.
It easily outperforms the Celeron in tasks where dual-core is important, as the Hyper-Threading makes up for the missing second core and performs slightly better than two cores.
The processor was first made available in early 2008 as Silverthorne, which would have a maximum thermal design power of just 8W, 3W less than the best Celeron. A brand new Intel Atom-based Mini-ITX board with an Intel Atom soldered on it would cost just ¬£30 when it was first released.
The Atom was small enough that Intel could manufacture far more Atoms than any other CPU per silicon wafer (about 2500 CPUs per 300mm diameter silicon wafer). It was actually at first a basis of the Centrino platform, making the Centrino Atom, but this was dropped in favour of the broader Intel Atom-based name. The Silverthorne based systems were designed specifically for the Mobile Internet Device (MID) market.
This segment had never seen a CPU quite as powerful as the x86 CPUs. Intel's Diamondville processor soon took the role of netbooks which had just recently been announced and were based on AMD's Geode and the ARM processor netbook market that had been created recently. This would take over from the Centrino Atom which currently used Intel Core 2 Duo processors.
The Atom does not feature an Integrated Heat Spreader (IHS) due to its exceptionally low power consumption and low temperatures.
Netbooks based on the Atom architecture are slimmer than the Centrino Atom processors seen previously in netbooks and their chipsets have a lower power consumption of (including the Atom itself) just 12W. The Atom can use both DDR2 and DDR3 RAM and it is also available as a dual-core version for nettops and higher-end netbooks. The dual-core Atoms are named the 300 series and they are dual-core, dual die modules again, like the Pentium D processor found in the far earlier NetBurst architecture.

By John Denton
Dec. 12, 2017
ORLANDO ‚Äì On the New Year‚Äôs Eve night in 2012 when Nikola Vucevic did the unthinkable in grabbing 29 rebounds and eclipsing Shaquille O‚ÄôNeal‚Äôs Orlando Magic record for boards in a game, the 7-foot center‚Äôs team suffered a heartbreaking, double-overtime loss.
On the night when Vucevic passed O‚ÄôNeal for second on the Magic‚Äôs all-time rebounding list, he wasn‚Äôt even able to enjoy the moment because Orlando was whalloped in a lopsided loss in Chicago.
This season, two of the greatest games of Vucevic‚Äôs seven-year NBA career ‚Äì a 41-point, 12-rebound effort on Oct. 20 in Brooklyn and a dominant triple-double performance on Saturday in Atlanta ‚Äì came similarly in losses.
Orlando‚Äôs longest-tenured player is carving out quite the legacy for himself among the Magic‚Äôs all-time greats, but the one thing missing from his rather impressive resume is the team success. Not only has Orlando‚Äôs five-plus seasons of struggles robbed Vucevic much of the joy of celebrating his accomplishments, but they have most likely kept him out of NBA All-Star Games. Los Angeles Clippers coach Doc Rivers, whose team will be in Orlando to face the Magic (11-17) on Wednesday, playfully called the Magic‚Äôs center ``the best player in the league that nobody knows‚Äô‚Äô back in 2014, and that is largely because the Magic haven‚Äôt been to the playoffs since 2012.
It‚Äôs somewhat clich√© to say that the big man would trade it all in for winning, but at this point Vucevic says his only focus is trying to find ways to help the Magic become winners once again.
``That‚Äôs really the only thing that matters to me ‚Äì what you‚Äôve done as a team because basketball is a team sport,‚Äô‚Äô said Vucevic, who is well on his way to leading the Magic in rebounding a sixth consecutive season and has 208 double-doubles in Orlando pinstripes. ``All of the individual honors are great, but there‚Äôs nothing better than winning as a team. Even your individual awards are much better when you win. If I would have had my triple-double in a win, it would have been so much better. Hopefully we get there before too long, getting more wins and getting to the playoffs because that would make everybody feel better. And it would feel better for me as well.‚Äô‚Äô
Vucevic could very well have to do most of the heavy lifting again on Wednesday against the Clippers (10-15) with Orlando possibly missing Aaron Gordon (concussion), Evan Fournier (ankle sprain), Terrence Ross (knee sprain) and Jonathan Isaac (ankle sprain) still bothered by injuries. Gordon, who suffered his concussion on Friday following a face-first collision with Denver‚Äôs Gary Harris, is the closest to returning after passing the first three stages of the NBA‚Äôs concussion protocol. If he makes it through Wednesday morning‚Äôs shoot-around session without symptoms and is cleared by an independent physician, Gordon should be ready to go on Wednesday.
``He did non-contact work (on Tuesday) and they keep testing him each day after the work level rises,‚Äô‚Äô Magic coach Frank Vogel said of Gordon. ``He‚Äôll continue with that (on Wednesday) at shootaround and we won‚Äôt know if he‚Äôs available until after shootaround sometime (during the day).‚Äô‚Äô
With the Magic playing without their top two scorers in Gordon (18.5 ppg.) and Fournier (18.3 ppg.), Vucevic did his best to pick up the slack and give his team a chance to win on Saturday in Atlanta. Not only did he score 31 points on an ultra-efficient 13-of-18 overall shooting and four-of-six accuracy from 3-point range, he handed out a career-best 10 assists and grabbed 13 rebounds. The assists are a product of the Magic putting the ball in Vucevic‚Äôs hands and trusting him to make the right play.
``The more times he touches the ball, the more good things that happen,‚Äô‚Äô Vogel said recently of his big man. ``It‚Äôs kind of a general theme that we have that when things are getting stagnant, get the ball in (Vucevic‚Äôs) hands someway ‚Äì in the post or at the top of the key in the dribble-hand-off game because he usually makes good things happen.‚Äô‚Äô
Added Magic veteran point guard D.J. Augustin: ``Vooch can score the ball with the best of the bigs and shoot the ball better than any big in the league. And he‚Äôs really smart and unselfish ‚Äì something a lot of people don‚Äôt know. He knows how to play the game. You can put Vooch on any team in the league and he‚Äôd succeed. You can‚Äôt say for a lot of people in the NBA. ‚Ä¶ Vooch is a smart player and he makes everybody around him better.‚Äô‚Äô
That has played out in the win/loss column this season when Vucevic has been relied upon in the Magic offense. When he scores at least 15 points, Orlando is 9-7, but it is just 2-10 when he fails to reach that 15-point plateau.
News of the first triple-double of Vucevic‚Äôs NBA career reached all the way to his native Montenegro and he received dozens of congratulatory text messages, tweets and calls from family, friends and National Team teammates from his home country. Still, Vucevic felt a bit embarrassed by all of the attention because his stellar performance didn‚Äôt come in a victory. He helped the short-handed Magic get the game tied at 110 in the final minutes, but the Hawks made all of the key plays down the stretch for a 117-110 victory.
Vucevic joined Dwight Howard (30 points, 19 rebounds and 10 blocks in 2008) and O‚ÄôNeal (24 points, 28 rebounds and 15 blocks in 1993) as the only Magic centers to record triple-doubles, but the caveat to his was that he did with assists. Playing the right way ‚Äì a phrase that the 27-year-old Vucevic likes to use because of his high respect for the game ‚Äì made the performance special despite the loss.
``It would have much better in a win, but to me it was just about me wanting to help the team and carry the team in any way that I can,‚Äô‚Äô said Vucevic, who is averaging 17.4 points, 9.2 rebounds and a career-best 3.3 assists per game. ``I‚Äôm proud of it because I was able to do it with assists and a lot of big men don‚Äôt do it that way. I was just trying to help the team anyway that I could.
``My passing came from us playing the right way and guys cutting and me finding them,‚Äô‚Äô he added. ``It wasn‚Äôt a triple-double where it was me having the ball all the time (with extra shots). It was just me trying to find guys in the flow. That‚Äôs why I appreciate this so much more.‚Äô‚Äô
A huge fan of soccer and specifically the Italian club, Juventus F.C., Vucevic‚Äôs favorite players have always been the ones who stick with their teams for long periods of time. Even though the Magic haven‚Äôt had much success in recent years, Vucevic considers himself extraordinarily fortunate to have stuck in Orlando these 5¬Ω seasons. Playing for the Magic for so long has allowed him to climb in the record books as he now ranks second in total rebounds (3,966), second in 10-rebound games (228, 14 this season) and he recently passed Scott Skiles for ninth in all-time minutes played for the franchise.
And the impressive numbers don‚Äôt stop there for the big man. In his Magic career, he has had six 20-point/20-rebound games, two 30-point/20-rebound games, 72 20-point/10-rebound performances and 30 times he‚Äôs notched at least 25 points and 10 rebounds. Those nights have allowed him to do things in a Magic jersey that greats such as Penny Hardaway, Tracy McGrady, Nick Anderson, Horace Grant, Dennis Scott, Jameer Nelson, Hedo Turkoglu, Rashard Lewis, O‚ÄôNeal and Howard never accomplished.
``It means a lot to me, especially considering all of the great players who have played for this franchise,‚Äô‚Äô said Vucevic, who has averaged 16 points and 10.6 rebounds over his 376 games with the Magic. ``It also comes from being able to play for a franchise for a long time. It allows you to leave some prints with your individual achievements.
``Last year, when I surpassed Shaq for rebounding, that was big for me because everybody knows how big Shaq is and all he‚Äôs done throughout his career. Obviously, Dwight is far away (for the lead) because he was a rebounding machine when he was here.‚Äô‚Äô
Vucevic vowed that all of the losing has only hardened his desire to help the Magic get over the hump and back into the playoffs. After all, posting big numbers and setting records feels much better in victories than in losses, the big man stressed.
``All of those (statistics) mean a lot to me, but hopefully it won‚Äôt be long until we start to get some wins and do some great things as a team as well,‚Äô‚Äô he said with conviction.:A flexible certificate which is issued by a depository bank in the United States is referred to as an American Depositary Receipt (ADR). This certificate characterizes a specific number of shares or can be issued for a single share also and even for making an investment in the stocks of any foreign company. Just like stocks, ADRs also trade on the U.S. stock exchange market.
One of the main advantages of ADRs is that one can trade on many stocks internationally also, because of which there is a dual benefit on both sides. Some of the international companies which are otherwise not unlocked to doing commerce on the United States market can also trade via ADRs.
ADRs are traded only in the denomination of American dollar. This makes the trader‚Äôs tension free in terms of trading because they do not have to deal in different currencies. ADRs deal in New York Stock Exchange (NYSE), NASDAQ, and American Stock Exchange (AMEX) and also via Over-the-Counter (OTC) contracts. United States‚Äô stock market gets another plus point because any overseas trade is only made when the country shares the full financial report about the companies and their stocks.
ADRs are categorized as follows-
- Sponsored ADRs
The foreign companies that get issued ADRs from American banks have to pay all the costs of the ADR and with this, they also get complete control over their transactions. An authorized contract is made between both the teams and the bank handles all the dealings. Such American Depositary Receipts are called Sponsored ADRs. Furthermore, the foreign companies should totally meet the terms set by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and also the procedures of American accounting.
- Unsponsored ADRs-
Such ADRs are not for any foreign companies directly. These can be issued by banks to those foreign companies which have already obtained sponsored ADRs from any other bank. These ADRs can have different dividends. A foreign company can have only one sponsored ADR and various unsponsored ADRs.
The major difference between these two ADRs is that where the sponsored ADRs can trade via all transactions and on all major stock exchanges of the U.S., unsponsored ADRs can only trade through the Over-the-Counter (OTC) trades. Also, sponsored ADRs are generally registered and licensed with voting rights.
There is another classification stage of ADRs where these are sorted amongst various levels. These are stated as follows-
- LEVEL 1
Not all foreign companies can trade with this type of ADR and some of the companies do not even meet the criteria to trade in this ADR. Such ADRs are not utilized to raise capital but they can be used to set up their trading existence. Also, these only trade via Over-the-Counter dealings. These are also more speculative than all other ADRs. Investors who take risks are the ones who typically deal here. Their cheap cost is the basic reason of attraction for many traders to make an investment in these.
- LEVEL 2
These ADRs are also not employed in raising capitals but have the potency to create their trading presence. These are overall better than the Level 1 ADRs because they have better requirements from the Securities and Exchange Commission and also get superior trading volume and greater visibility.
- LEVEL 3
These are the best because they along with establishing their trading presence also give foreign issuers an opportunity to raise capitals. These ADRs have to be completely reported to the Securities and Exchange Commission and this accounts for their greater transparency.JOB DETAILS

And a cut-out-and-keep caustic guide to AI ethics.
Short thought: One of the more interesting ‚Äúlittle firms that could‚Äù in the online services space has long been the outfit currently known as Basecamp. Its founder, Jason Fried, has been voluble ‚Äì and thoughtful and interesting ‚Äì about how to do good work remotely, long before the past year made that a necessity.
But now he and David Henmeier Hanson, known as ‚ÄúDHH‚Äù (together the senior management of Basecamp), have solidly put their feet in it. I won‚Äôt rehearse the background in detail, because others have done it far better. The tl;dr version (and this is a really thin summary of a big story):
- Basecamp employees ‚Äì a sizeable chunk of the 60-odd staff base ‚Äì started to work on diversity and inclusion issues. Management blessed this.
- In the process, the fact that for many years the firm‚Äôs internal systems had hosted a list of ‚Äúfunny customer names‚Äù ‚Äì many of which, inevitably, were those of people of colour ‚Äì came in for understandable criticism.
- Initially, management were onside with this criticism; indeed, they owned their part in the list‚Äôs maintenance over the years.
- But then it got ugly. A number of staff saw the list in the context of ongoing institutional discrimination ‚Äì not just or even not mainly at Basecamp, to be clear, but societally. Management (Jason and DHH) pushed back against what they seemed to see as an over-reaction.
- Jason and DHH announced that political discussion was now to be off-limits. (They later amended this ‚Äì albeit apparently without making it clear that there was an amendment ‚Äì to it being off-limits only on Basecamp‚Äôs own chat and comms systems.) They also said they would withdraw benefits, instead simply paying the cash value thereof, so as not to be ‚Äúpaternalist‚Äù.
- This caused uproar. An all-staff meeting saw one senior and long-time executive play the ‚Äúif you call this racism, you‚Äôre the racist‚Äù, ‚Äúno such thing as white supremacy‚Äù card; he resigned shortly afterwards. As many as a third of the staff have now also taken redundancy.
- This might seem like a tempest in a teacup. Small tech firm has row; news at 11.
But it‚Äôs not. Tech is still overwhelmingly white and overwhelmingly male, particularly at its senior levels. (It may not escape your notice that the Bar isn‚Äôt much better.) Which means its leadership often misses the key point, which is this: when you‚Äôre not rich and comfortable, when your life has incorporated a lot of moments where you don‚Äôt get to expect everything will go smoothly, when you don‚Äôt have that much of a safety net, when large numbers of people at all levels of power get to mess you about just because they can, without you having much recourse, just about everything is political.
Healthcare is political, if its availability and quality vary depending on where you live and what you look like. (Don‚Äôt doubt this: I‚Äôve seen healthcare professionals, who I‚Äôm certain would be genuinely horrified by conscious prejudice, treat Black women with breathtaking disdain compared with how they talk to people like me.) Pay is political. Work is political, because expectations and yardsticks vary unless we pay honest attention to how they‚Äôre generated and applied.
Put simply: cutting political and social issues out of the workplace is a luxury only comfortable people can afford. A luxury which exacerbates, rather than diminishes, the power imbalance built into to workplaces by the sheer fact of people‚Äôs dependence on a paycheque. (This, by the way, is why in the UK and Europe we say people can‚Äôt consent to the use of their data in the workplace. If the alternative to consent is ‚Äúfind another job‚Äù, that isn‚Äôt free consent for anyone without a private income.)
For Jason and DHH to take this approach is to forget that the only people for whom politics doesn‚Äôt relate to business are those who get to dictate the terms of what goes and what doesn‚Äôt. The blindness appears to dismal effect in a post by DHH on ‚ÄúBasecamp‚Äôs new etiquette at work‚Äù:
Just don‚Äôt bring it into the internal communication platforms we use for work, unless it directly relates to our business. I‚Äôm applying that same standard to myself, and Jason is too.
Well, that‚Äôs nice. Reminds of that line about the right of the rich to sleep under bridges. I wonder why.
Someone is right on the internet: On a somewhat related topic, issues of ethics in AI are big news, at least among geeks. Which is as it should be: the more AI or quasi-AI comes to control, dictate or direct our lives, the more concern we should have about whether the black boxes in question are exacerbating structural or other unfairness or inequality. It‚Äôs not good enough to just blame ‚Äì for instance ‚Äì algorithms that can‚Äôt recognise Black people on ‚Äúcomputer says no‚Äù. People make decisions, and they must be accountable.
(This, of course, is why Article 22 of the GDPR prohibits ‚Äúsolely automated processing, including profiling‚Äù ‚Äì although it‚Äôs by no means impossible to get round this by inserting a human into the final stage of the process, or by making statutory arrangements to allow for it.)
Big Tech isn‚Äôt that comfortable about this, so it seems ‚Äì as shown by Google‚Äôs removal (whether it‚Äôs officially sacking or not isn‚Äôt wholly clear, but it‚Äôs effectively an ejection anyway) of two senior women working on AI issues.
So MIT Technology Review‚Äôs caustic A-Z of how to talk about AI ethics is horrifically on the nose. A couple of examples will suffice, I hope, to encourage you to go and read it:
ethics principles ‚Äì A set of truisms used to signal your good intentions. Keep it high-level. The vaguer the language, the better. See responsible AI.
human in the loop ‚Äì Any person that is part of an AI system. Responsibilities range from faking the system‚Äôs capabilities to warding off accusations of automation.
privacy trade-off ‚Äì The noble sacrifice of individual control over personal information for group benefits like AI-driven health-care advancements, which also happen to be highly profitable.
And the best one comes first:
accountability ‚Äì The act of holding someone else responsible for the consequences when your AI system fails.
Ouch. But yes.

If you have landed on this blog you're probably already been told you have Indian in your family or you suspect a past ancestor was Indian. It's time for the truth to be revealed. Are you ready?
A few disclaimers before I explain how to go throw the proper steps of researching American Indian ancestry. Read them below.
You may not find documents of your American Indian ancestors and that's ok
When bad meets worse it's possible you may or may not find documents of your ancestors being labeled Indian. Yes, it is possible to be Indian without being documented as Indian.
Please keep in mind that American Indian and so called Black People have went through and still going through paper genocide (the act of writing American Indians out of history through our birth records, death certificates etc).
Because of this awful act done against American Indians you may not find the documents you are looking for or at least not right away. However, do not give up hope. You never know what truly is in store for you.
If you do find American Indian documentation in your family and want to be enrolled be prepared to fight your ass off
Indians of darker hue go through so much shit especially those labeled as Black Indians. There are soo many lawsuits surrounding Black American Indians reclaiming status and citizenship through the tribes.
You may not call yourself black or see yourself as black but tribal council members most likely will. The fight of who is indigenous and what is an Indian is at an all time high.
If you are a freedman like me and want to be enrolled GOOD LUCK! It's not impossible but the kickback and racism dealing with being enrolled is to be expected.
Step 1. Get Your Facts Straight
Have all your information together before you research. It makes the process easier and runs smoother. Get the names of your elders, their birthdates and death dates, their children names and so on. Make sure you get as much accurate information as possible about your family and then you head to a genealogy website.
Step 2. Do The Research
Now it's time to put your ducks in a row. I like to use Ancestry.com to research my genealogy. I start with myself and then add my parents and their information like birthday and birthplace.
Then I add their parents information and then their parent's parents information and so on and so forth. There are many different places you can research your family at. Click here to view different resources to search your genealogy.
Confirm and make sure to match your family's information with the documents you find. Some family records may be out of whack like your great aunt may be labeled as a male or your grandfather name is spelled wrong. But a tell sign that the record belongs to them but the similar information they both share.
The record may say Jun 1934 with your family member name and birthplace but their actual birthday is June 24th, 1934 it is more than likely that this record belongs to your family member.
Step 3. Confirm Your Findings With The Tribe
You found a record of you Indigenous American ancestor! YAY! Now save it! Birth, marriage, and death records can be retrieved by contacting or visiting the right clerk's office in a town or county courthouse, or by contacting or visiting state offices of vital records. Copies or transcripts may also be available through genealogical societies, historical societies, and site archives.
Call the tribe and confirm with the genealogist that the names and information is correct. Once it has been confirmed, print out her birth certificate, death certificate and add it to your application for tribal enrollment.
Some tribes may need DNA testing to confirm if you are indeed a relative to this person/ancestor. Remember DNA testing is NOT the same as DNA ancestry testing. You cannot use solely use a DNA ancestry test to solely enroll in a tribe. You must bring documentation or otherwise you will not be accepted and your application will be denied. Once you submit your application the tribe will either call or mail you your acceptance or denial letter.
Each tribe is different so make sure to call them and confirm what you will need to show proof of American Indian ancestry.
Here is a video of Atsila Yona discussing how to trace American Indian genealogy.

Architect: Grant Davis Thompson Inc.
Location: Clinton Hill, Brooklyn, NY

Don‚Äôt be fooled by the name ‚Äì this Brooklyn ‚ÄúPlayhouse‚Äù isn‚Äôt just for kids. It was built with grown-ups in mind too. And rightfully so. After all, why should the wee ones get all the fun? That was the homeowners‚Äô attitude when they hired Grant Davis Thompson to transform their Clinton Hill backyard into a social hub the whole family could enjoy. Good news ‚Äì GDT delivered!
Taking a playful approach, the boutique general contractor & design firm incorporated a hidden sandbox/cooler/kiddie pool into the playhouse structure. Whimsical, yet functional, features likes these, combined with GDT‚Äôs woodworking expertise, imbue this project with an undeniable charm that‚Äôs hard to ignore.
Another standout aspect of Playhouse is all that rustically beautiful wood. Everything from the fence to the furniture is made entirely of Western Red Cedar.
‚ÄúThe decision was made to use a material that was sourced as locally as possible,‚Äù says Palmer Thompson-Moss, GDT principal and owner. ‚ÄúWe wanted to choose a material which was naturally resilient to the outdoors rather than material that had to be painted or added to.‚Äù
As part of this artisan aesthetic, it was important that the wood didn‚Äôt look overly polished. So the GDT team and their clients opted to leave the structures untreated. This will allow the cedar to weather naturally, eventually turning into a graceful silver patina. They also went for a knotty grade of wood, as oppose to a clear grade.
‚ÄúWe liked the natural quality of the material,‚Äù explains Thompson-Moss. ‚ÄúOur goal wasn‚Äôt to cover up the cedar but rather to celebrate the material in its natural quality.‚Äù

Abu Dhabi - Investment in early childhood development is crucial for success, not only for the child but for the society in general.
‚ÄúThere is clearly no better investment any family or community or country or region can make than by investing in young children. That‚Äôs when you reap the biggest benefit,‚Äù said Dr Walter Gilliam, director of Edward Zigler Centre in Child Development and Social Policy at Yale University Child Study Centre.
That is, in fact, the investment that the Salama bint Hamdan Al Nahyan Foundation has done through its Shamsa bint Mohammed Al Nahyan Fellowship in early childhood development (ECD). For the second batch of the two-year fellowship programme, 10 young professionals, eight of them Emiratis, were chosen to train with experts in the field of ECD in collaboration with Yale University.
Dr Gilliam was one of the experts from Yale conducting the training for the fellows in the UAE, all of whom are advocates and practitioners of ECD in the medical and education fields. The programme includes three weeks of enrichment led by international experts, field visits to ECD centres abroad and attendance at the ECD international conference.
Dr Nancy Close, associate director of the Yale Programme in Early Childhood Education said the programme will follow last year‚Äôs curriculum which focuses on parent-child interaction, importance of play in child development, importance of planning developmentally-appropriate curricula for children, infants and toddler care, pre-school and KG1 and 2.
‚ÄúOne of the most important ingredients in early childhood development has to do with the relationships that children develop that lays the foundation for everything,‚Äù she pointed out.
It is a relationship that can be nurtured as early as day one. Dr Close said the first hour of life is important and that parents ought to ‚Äúfocus as much time and energy in getting to know‚Äù their baby, his temperament, nursing and holding him as this sets the foundation in building a positive sense of well-being in the child.
These learnings are some of the important take-aways that the fellows are expected to impart and disseminate in their respective fields that could impact the way ECD is practiced here.
Khawla Saleh is completing her doctorate degree in public health focussing on child safety, and is one of the fellows. She noted how the programme has taught her to connect more with a child.
‚Äú(The programme) has helped me widen my view on the needs of children, to become more nurturing and their needs at this age‚Ä¶ in a nursing kind of care,‚Äù added Amal Al Jaberi, a paediatrician.
A visit to the US and speaking with ECD practitioners there have also taught Amanda Gillam, an early years‚Äô educator from New Zealand, the importance of play-based learning, which is considered a new concept in the UAE.
Sharifa Yateem, a board-certified applied behaviour analyst with special interest in decreasing problem behaviours to ensure optimal education, noted the importance of play-based learning. ‚ÄúIt is important for cognitive and social skills, even emotional competencies and problem-solving skills of a child,‚Äù she said.
For Saeeda Al Mazrooqi, her fellowship at the foundation will benefit her research on family life in the UAE and the importance of social-emotional development in early childhood.
The foundation received over 100 applicants for the 2014-2016 batch of fellows. Criteria include having three years working in the field of ECD, on the ground experience of working with children, in addition to being bright, passionate, creative, dedicated, determined and possessing leadership skills.
According to a survey commissioned by the foundation, 90 per cent of attendees from its parenting talks said they learned an important concept about child development with every session.
Eighty-two per cent indicated learning new practices with regards to how children‚Äôs early interaction with parents impacts their social-emotional and cognitive development, while eighteen percent indicated already having this knowledge prior to the talk. Only five per cent of attendees said they understood and helped their children manage their emotions.

Ease of use, time-of-post info, and breakdowns of fan activity are all blessings for community mangers.
Facebook has rolled out its update to Insights. It‚Äôs been a long time coming, too, as Facebook has been slow to update its page-data platform‚Äîat least in meaningful ways‚Äîbut this update comes a lot closer to being useful than previous updates have. Five Insights updates/upgrades warrant a closer look: A cleaner, easier-to-scan dashboard The big win here is the way the numbers are presented. At a glance you can evaluate the three aspects of Facebook that most clients/organizations most care about: page ‚Äúlikes,‚Äù reach, and engagement. You can also compare page ‚Äúlikes‚Äù and reach from week to week, which is great for showing progress to clients and bosses. I love the engagement summary‚Äîan easy way to view weekly totals for ‚Äúlikes,‚Äù comments, shares, and clicks. Imagine how easy weekly summaries will be for clients now. Finally, data to help you figure out the best time to post Remember all those posts telling you the best time to post on Facebook? We know they‚Äôre crap. Different audiences require different things. Previously, Facebook hadn‚Äôt provided great data about the best times to post for our pages. Now, it has corrected that. This view gives you specific data on the best times to post to reach your fans, not the general Facebook population. What‚Äôs more, click on any day at the top, and a dotted line will show the time breakout for that day. Are photo posts really working? You can find out for yourself. Photo-based posts will probably be No. 1 for many brands, but now you have data to back up that assumption. Plus, you can see how link, straight status, and video posts stack up. It‚Äôs brand-specific information on which to base your future decisions. Facebook shows you the engagement data on the right-hand side, as well. So, maybe your photo posts are working in terms of reach, but status updates (which you‚Äôre primarily using as questions) are generating more ‚Äúengagement.‚Äù This way, you can actually see those highly useful metrics. Total fans vs. engaged fans OK, these are basic demographics‚Äîbut now you can compare fans vs. fans you‚Äôve reached vs. fans you‚Äôve engaged. Big difference. For example, this page‚Äôs audience leans toward women 18‚Äì44 (a big age group), but if you look at the fans reached‚Ä¶ ‚Ä¶you can see it still leans toward women, but it starts to skew younger now: 18‚Äì34. If we look at engaged fans‚Ä¶ ‚Ä¶we see it‚Äôs much more heavily skewed toward women (78 percent now vs. 62 percent of all fans), and it‚Äôs skewing much younger (54 percent are ages 18‚Äì34 vs. just 30 percent of all fans). So, what does all this mean? It means, women ages 18‚Äì34 are our ‚Äúsuper fans,‚Äù those who engage with posts most frequently‚Äîthose who ‚Äúlike,‚Äù comment on, and share our stuff. That‚Äôs our core target. It‚Äôs hugely helpful info for all community managers.

Excerpt
The city council had no choice but to call an emergency meeting with the mayor. All but one of the council members, despite the late notice, were able to make it. The police chief was summoned, and the head of the Bruntfield Police Union also insisted on being present. They didn‚Äôt meet in the public hall, but rather in the private chambers in the back where they sat around an oval walnut table, nearly all of them dressed in white buttoned- down short-sleeve shirts, except for the chief who was dressed in uniform, and one councilman dressed in a suit and tie.
‚ÄúSo now we‚Äôre national news,‚Äù the mayor announced despondently. He was a short man with a very round body, his features reminding one of a genial uncle in a TV sitcom. He had a buzz cut hairstyle and distended cheeks. Despite his almost comical looks, he was well liked by the people, and now deep in his second term. ‚ÄúCare to tell us how that happened, John?‚Äù
John Garson, Chief of Police, Bruntfield Township, squirmed uneasily in his chair. His embarrassment looked incongruous when compared to his reputation and his mien, a well-built man, his chiseled features bearing the epitome of moral integrity, his hair cut in an austere style that radiated a combination of duty and pride; a dedicated officer of the law. ‚ÄúOfficers Puente and Fox responded to a call of vandalism and approached a man who fitted the description that was consistent with the 911 call. From what I know at this point, and that may change, is that the suspect resisted arrest.‚Äù
‚ÄúWas he armed?‚Äù
‚ÄúAs far as I know he was not, mayor.‚Äù ‚ÄúWere there other officers involved?‚Äù
‚ÄúYes, backup was requested and two units responded.‚Äù
‚ÄúIs it safe to say‚Äù‚Äîand now the mayor‚Äôs voice took on a mordant tone‚Äî\‚Äùthat allegations are going to be made that these men, six officers in total, used excessive force on an unarmed man, considering he‚Äôs dead as a result of this confrontation?‚Äù ‚ÄúMore than likely, Your Honor.‚Äù
‚ÄúAn unarmed homeless man, who just happens to be a goddamned war hero!‚Äù exclaimed the mayor, slapping his hand on the table. ‚ÄúPurple Heart, Bronze Star!‚Äù
The silence that followed was not surprising.
‚ÄúA man dies while being apprehended, and we aren‚Äôt even sure if he committed this petty act of vandalism. This looks bad. Like hooliganism. A goddamned war hero for Chrissakes! Thank God it wasn‚Äôt a black man!‚Äù
A chuckling snort was heard from the far side of the table.
‚ÄúYou got something to say, Ray?‚Äù
Ray Miffler was the leading property developer in Bruntfield, and his inputs into town planning were significant. But he typically contributed next to nothing on any other issue. And he was a smartass too. His angular face opened into a wily smile. ‚ÄúIt could have been worse‚Ä¶could have been a woman. Imagine, six burly cops?‚Äù
The mayor instantly regretted giving this man any attention and didn‚Äôt wait for the idiot to finish before he shouted, ‚ÄúHe had a prosthetic foot for God‚Äôs sake! No more flippant comments, Ray, or we‚Äôll throw you out of here!‚Äù
The mayor then redirected his attention back to Garson. ‚ÄúDo you know these men, John?‚Äù
‚ÄúOf course I‚Äôm familiar with them, it‚Äôs a small force.‚Äù
‚ÄúChief Garson,‚Äù injected a middle-aged balding man with a bushy red mustache, wearing wire-rimmed spectacles; Brad Wilkinson, also the Superintendent of Bruntfield School District, ‚Äúhave any of these men been implicated in any similar situations, where, I mean, excessive force was suspected?‚Äù
‚ÄúOf course, we checked that first thing, and there had been some complaints against three of the officers. It was quite a while ago, before I came.‚Äù
‚ÄúAnd what is the status of these men, are they still on the job?‚Äù
‚ÄúAs of this moment, yes, but I am considering full suspension pending the outcome of this meeting.‚Äù
The police union boss fidgeted in his chair. Bushy salt-and- pepper hair, puffed up in a style dating back to the fifties, jowls that hung like slabs of beef, his tremendous paunch half-hidden beneath the table, he made clear his position. ‚ÄúThat wouldn‚Äôt be acceptable to us. Paid administrative leave is more what we have in mind. It‚Äôs not the first time this has been done pending an investigation‚Ä¶almost standard‚Ä¶remember, innocent until proven guilty.‚Äù
‚ÄúSo how else are we going to respond to this!‚Äù the mayor demanded.
Abe Norson, small-headed but handsome, with a fashionably trimmed van-dyke, the owner of Bruntfield‚Äôs Ford dealership, spoke up. ‚ÄúI think at the very least we should hold an inquiry.‚Äù Wilkinson couldn‚Äôt suppress himself. ‚ÄúInquiry?‚Äù he blurted.
‚ÄúA man is dead, I would think a grand jury would be more appropriate.‚Äù
The mayor looked directly across from him. ‚ÄúBurns?‚Äù Alexander Burns was the sixty-four-year-old city attorney.
The only councilman wearing a full suit despite the heat wave. His black, thick-framed glasses sat perched upon a hairless rectangular-shaped granite face, his wide mouth horizontal, his little eyes revealing nothing. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm afraid I concur with Councilman Wilkinson. We need to demonstrate that we‚Äôre on top of this and that we take the matter seriously‚Ä¶a grand jury would serve that purpose.‚Äù
The beefy police union rep immediately responded. ‚ÄúWe would be vigorously opposed to that.‚Äù
‚ÄúI advise grand jury proceedings,‚Äù Burns countered. ‚ÄúBut no indictment.‚Äù
‚ÄúExcuse me,‚Äù Wilkinson blurted. ‚ÄúHow can you say ‚Äòno indictment‚Äô? We have to hear the evidence first, or am I off- course here?‚Äù
‚ÄúIt‚Äôs the DA‚Äôs ballgame. Isn‚Äôt that right, Louis?‚Äù
Louis Pimply, a deputy DA, a wiry man in his early thirties, responded. ‚ÄúMost of the time, yes.‚Äù
‚ÄúAny witnesses, John?‚Äù the city attorney asked.
Garson put his head down, signaling an unpleasant reply. ‚ÄúFour. And then there‚Äôs a videotape‚Ä¶from the bus depot.‚Äù
‚ÄúIs it in police possession?‚Äù
Garson nodded his head affirmatively. Burns looked at the deputy DA. ‚ÄúLouis?‚Äù
‚ÄúThe DA‚Äôs office does have the final say as to what evidence can be admitted.‚Äù
Miffler spoke up. ‚ÄúWhat about this homeless guy? Any history of violence? Prior arrests? Minor infractions?‚Äù
Garson answered. ‚ÄúHe was cited for loitering, sometime last year.‚Äù
‚ÄúIs he of right mind?‚Äù Miffler continued, ‚ÄúI mean, you know, these vets sometimes come home a bit looney‚Ä¶was he involved in any treatment for that matter?‚Äù
‚ÄúAh now, Ray has an excellent point there,‚Äù Burns said. ‚ÄùLet‚Äôs look at the supposed victim‚Äôs background and see if we can find anything to show he wasn‚Äôt just a complacent citizen, but someone whose actions were, say, unbalanced, and therefore threatened the well-being of the responding officers.‚Äù
‚ÄúThere were two letters,‚Äù Garson disclosed, ‚Äúthat we believe he intended to mail. Stamps were on them, but I guess he forgot to mail them. They were both addressed to the New Hope Trauma Recovery Clinic in Manhattan.‚Äù
‚ÄúThat‚Äôs a start,‚Äù Burns said.
‚ÄúSo, we are aiming at no indictment, precluding a trial?‚Äù Wilkinson asked in disbelief, causing a fit of murmuring among the council members.
Burns held both his hands out to grab everyone‚Äôs attention. ‚ÄúA trial can last months, even a year or more, do you really want that constant publicity?‚Äù
Norson, the car dealer, raised an important point. ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt you think that when it‚Äôs announced that there‚Äôll be no trial, the public outcry, which no doubt there will be, will cause harm to our standing in the eyes of the people?‚Äù
‚ÄúOf course, there will be a hell of a hullabaloo,‚Äù Burns admitted. ‚ÄúBut you‚Äôll see, it won‚Äôt last long. The public will just get tired of the whole thing and the dust will settle, in less than a year I imagine. But a trial‚Ä¶we‚Äôll be in the headlines continually.\‚Äù
\‚ÄùLet‚Äôs put it to a vote,‚Äù the mayor suggested. ‚ÄúInquiry, or grand jury with no indictment.‚Äù
After fifteen minutes of discussion, votes were cast. Grand jury, no indictment, was the final decision. It seemed a sensible decision. But then again, none of them could be expected to have predicted the future.

EL PASO, Texas (AP) ‚Äî Keith Frazier had 21 points and eight rebounds and UTEP won for the second time in three games since the sudden retirement of coach Tim Floyd, beating Washington State 76-69 on Saturday night.
Omega Harris scored 18 points and went 8 of 8 on free throws as the Miners (3-6) made 21 of 22 from the line while committing just six turnovers under interim coach Phil Johnson.
Viont'e Daniels led Washington State with 18 points, all of them on 6-of-12 shooting from 3-point range, as the Cougars (6-3) lost their third straight since a 6-0 start.
The Miners have won two in a row under Johnson after losing to rival New Mexico State in the first game after Floyd abruptly retired following a loss to Lamar on Nov. 27.
Matt Willms put UTEP ahead for good when he tipped in a miss from Evan Gilyard for a 57-55 lead with just under 11 minutes remaining. The Miners outscored the Cougars by 15 points after the 4-minute mark of the first half.
"Everything changed in the second half," Johnson said. "We guarded better. And we got some good offense from Keith and Omega. It's a good win for the program. It's a good win for our guys."
Paul Thomas scored 11 points, Gilyard added 10 and Willms had eight points and seven rebounds.
Leading 66-65, UTEP closed on a 10-4 run that included a dunk by Frazier, four free throws from Harris and two from Gilyard.
Robert Franks scored 14 points for Washington State, while Malachi Flynn, the second-leading scorer at 17 points per game coming in, was held to three points on 1-of-8 shooting. Daniels had just six points after halftime.
"We didn't do a good enough job of finding Daniels enough in the second half," Washington State coach Ernie Kent said. "And they did a good job of closing out the game."
BIG PICTURE
Washington State: The Cougars have faltered badly since getting Top 25 votes two weeks ago. It was the first time to get votes in the poll since 2011, but they won't have to worry about getting ranked anytime soon.
UTEP: The Miners have some hope under Johnson, a longtime Floyd assistant going back to their time together in the NBA. The first of two straight quality wins came against New Mexico, another longtime rival along with New Mexico State.
STILL ENCOURAGED
The first two losses on Washington State's skid were by 14 to UC-Davis and by 27 at Idaho. But Kent said he was encouraged by a better effort against UTEP. "That's good for this young team," he said. "They continue to fight through adversity, figure it out and play better. Unfortunately, we didn't close out the game."
UP NEXT
Washington State: Home against IUPUI on Dec. 16.
UTEP: The Miners are in the midst of seven December games that are all at home, including the first two Conference USA games. Incarnate Word is next on Dec. 19.

How Does Divorce Work in Nebraska?
You may be wondering, "How Do I Get a Divorce in Nebraska?" Divorce can be a complex matter, especially if property division and custody are involved. There are, however, a few facts to remember when filing for divorce:
- The couple seeking divorce must have resided in Nebraska for at least one year before filing.
- The process can only begin once you file a Complaint for Dissolution within the county you live in.
- There is a fee to file a Complaint for Dissolution.
- If you find out that your spouse has changed address after filing the complaint, notify the district court immediately.
- Once the divorce paperwork has been filed, it takes at least 60 days for the divorce to be finalized.
Is a Lawyer Required for Divorce?
There is no current law that specifies the need to hire a lawyer when filing for divorce. Although many couples have successfully filed solo, most legal experts would agree that consulting with an attorney is in your best interest.
This is because it is easy to overlook some of the more complex laws associated with divorce, such as child custody. Additional reasons you‚Äôll want to retain legal representation for your divorce include:
They can take the burden of documents and excess paperwork off your shoulders
They can interpret the law and communicate these to you an easy way
You will need to hire an attorney if your spouse does as well
They can help you identify the issues that are worth pursuing, which can help save time and money
For more information on this topic, give us a call today. We will help set you up for both short and long term success.
Is Nebraska a Community Property State?
No, Nebraska is not considered a community property state. It is an equitable distribution state which allows the court to divide the property between spouses based on what is "fair and equitable". This does not mean that the property will be split 50/50, rather a judge will determine the value of all assets and disperse it in a way that keeps both parties financially, physically, and emotionally healthy.
Some factors that may be involved in determining asset distribution include:
- Each spouses contributions to the marriage
- Earning abilities of each spouse following the divorce
- The positive and negative effects of giving an asset to one spouse over the other
- The financial implications of dividing stocks, real estate, businesses
- The age, health, and overall well-being of each spouse
If an agreement was made prior to the divorce, that outlined asset division, then the court will not need to intervene. Equitable distribution will only apply if the spouses cannot agree.
How Is Alimony Determined in Nebraska?
One of the main considerations when a judge is deciding whether or not to award alimony is the ability of each spouse to maintain the same standard of living they had throughout their marriage.
This involves looking at each spouses‚Äô job, their earning potential, and their marketable skills, as well as the job market. The goal of alimony is not for one spouse to rely on it indefinitely, rather the goal is to help them be able to provide for themselves.
Is Nebraska a No-Fault Divorce State?
Yes, Nebraska is a no-fault divorce state, which means that you can file for divorce on the grounds of your marriage being irretrievably broken. You do not need to prove that your spouse did something to provoke the divorce. Even if your spouse disagrees with the divorce, you can still file.
To initiate the no-fault divorce process in Nebraska, you must first file for a complaint at your local court. This complaint is called a dissolution of marriage and will require certain details, including:
- The retirement or pension accounts of each spouse
- Whether alimony exists and which spouse is receiving it
- Whether marital property and/or debt is being shared between the spouses
- If children are involved; this would not apply if a previous agreement has been created by the couple
Secondly, you will need to show that the marriage is irretrievably broken and there is no chance at repair. This is generally easy to do, as most courts accept it as fact. Residency requirements must also be met, meaning at least one of the spouses has lived within state lines for a year. Lastly, you will need to wait 60 days, which is the mandatory waiting period in Nebraska. This gives the couple ample time to work out their differences.
It's important to have experienced representation on your side. Contact Douglas, Kelly, Ostdiek, Snyder, Ossian and Vogl, P.C. online or call (308) 365-1994 for a free consultation with our Nebraska divorce Lawyers.

Child custody and visitation are some of the most important family law matters we handle at our firm. The future and happiness of your children is your priority, which is why we make it ours, as well.
In Nebraska, custody and visitation rights are either decided by the parents through mediation or collaborative law, or they are decided by a family law judge if the matter is contested. The judge will make his or her decision based on a number of factors, including:
- Each parent's schedule and ability to spend quality time with the child
- Each parent's home environment
- Each parent's income
- Any history of drug or physical abuse
- The child's preference, in qualifying cases
Our divorce attorneys in Scottsbluff is dedicated to keeping families together and protecting the rights of children. If you are separated from your children's other parent and need to seek custody or visitation rights, give us a call today to learn how we can fight for your rights.
Is Child Support Mandatory For Joint Custody?
Yes, financial support is often ordered by the court so that the parent with the higher earnings can continue to give the child a comfortable living.
Can a Child Decided Which Parent to Live With?
The state of Nebraska will always determine custody arrangements based on what is in the best interests of the child. While the wishes of the child are often considered, they are not controlling but merely acknowledged. This is true for even children with comprehension and sound reasoning,
What Rights Do Grandparents Have With Children?
Grandparents will not be awarded custody unless the parents of the child are shown to be unfit. The best interests of the child will always be considered, and to be determined in a court hearing for the child to be in the care of the grandparents over the parents. This is often through filing for guardianship where the the grandparent has full legal custody of the child.
The statutes of Nebraska permit court ordered grandparent visitation when the parents deny a grandparent any time with their grandchild but only when certain conditions are satisfied. The grandparents may file a petition for visitation during, after, or when the parents of the child are going through a divorce.
The court may grant reasonable visitation to the grandparents if there is evidence of a beneficial relationship between the child and grandparent. The significance of the relationship between the child and grandparent must not adversely interfere with the relationship between each parent and their child. The continuing of the relationship must also be in the best interests in the child.
Adoption Attorneys in Scottsbluff, NE
Adoption involves transferring parental rights between the child's biological parents to parents who wish to adopt them. Adoptive parents are responsible for the care, well-being, and upbringing of the child, in the same way that biological parents are expected.
The adoption process will be different for every child, depending on factors such as his or her age, the child's current situation or background, and how willing the biological parents are in giving up their rights. As Scottsbluff adoption lawyers, we have seen cases where the biological parents' rights have been revoked by the court. We can help you with this process, whatever your circumstances may be so that you can give your child the home he or she deserves.
How Much Does It Cost to Adopt a Child in Nebraska?
All expenses related to the adoption will range greatly depending on the type you choose. If you are looking to adopt internationally, domestically, or through an agency, all costs will vary. Specific expenses that you may be responsible for include:
- Agency fees
- Attorney fees
- Counseling or traveling expenses
- Medical costs associated with the birth mother and child
When is Consent Not Necessary in Nebraska?
Consent to adopt may not be necessary if the parent is/has:
- Not capable of providing consent
- Has relinquished the child in writing
- Having their parental rights terminated by the court
- Abandoned the child at least 6 months before filing for adoption

1.1 What general regulatory regimes and issues should blockchain developers consider when building the governance framework for the operation of blockchain/distributed ledger technology protocols?
The blockchain economy allows for a new form of organisational design though decentralised autonomous organisations (DAOs), whose governance rules are specified in the blockchain. However, the recent experiences of some DAOs have highlighted that since they are run through smart contracts, if there is a bug or error in the smart contract code, the potential remedial effects could be problematic due to the autonomous enforcement mechanisms in place.
For this reason, DAO governance mechanisms should be examined and design-oriented research should be conducted to identify solutions to the risks of smart contracts and propose risk management mechanisms to mitigate such risks.
1.2 How do the foregoing considerations differ for public and private blockchains?
See question 4.7.
1.3 What general regulatory issues should users of a blockchain application consider when using a particular blockchain/distributed ledger protocol?
Privacy laws, contractual laws, IT security regulations and standards, and industry-specific laws ‚Äì for example, financial services laws in relation to stablecoins and securities laws in relation to security tokens.
1.4 Which administrative bodies are responsible for enforcing the applicable laws and regulations? What powers do they have?
The authority which deals with licensing is the Malta Financial Services Authority (MFSA). The MFSA grants and revokes licences and has the power to issue hefty fines. When it comes to anti-money laundering, following findings from police investigation units, the Financial Intelligence Analysis Unit and the courts have the power to enforce the applicable rules and regulations.
1.5 What is the regulators' general approach to blockchain?
The Malta Digital Innovation Authority (MDIA) is responsible for certifying and auditing distributed ledger technology (DLT) and blockchain technology systems. The MDIA works with the MFSA in relation to the granting of licences to service providers that utilise DLT and blockchain technology. The reason that Malta adopted this approach is to ensure that specialised tech experts can check the tech side of things, in order to maintain high standards of security and quality.
1.6 Are any industry or trade associations influential in the blockchain space?
The Malta Blockchain Association often organises events in collaboration with key industry players, such as Finance Malta. The University of Malta also conducts research and has introduced some crypto and blockchain-related courses; and the MDIA is quite active in carrying out technical research in the field.
2 Blockchain market
2.1 Which blockchain applications and protocols have become most embedded in your jurisdiction?
Reportedly, more than 51% of such applications and protocols are built on Ethereum.
2.2 What potential new applications/protocols are most actively being explored?
Various sectors ‚Äì including finance, pharmaceuticals and supply chain/distribution ‚Äì are exploring and shifting to blockchain technology, thanks to its capacity to resolve issues relating to factors such as trust and accountability.
2.3 Which industries within your jurisdiction are making material investments within the blockchain space?
Much development is taking place within the capital markets space. Players include the stock exchange and security token offering issuers, as well as crypto-exchanges (eg, BTC, ETH and Tether).
2.4 Are any initiatives or governmental programmes in place to incentivise blockchain development in your jurisdiction?
The Malta Information Technology Agency has established accelerator programmes that offer pre-seed investment to blockchain and fintech start-ups. The government is also investing around ‚Ç¨200,000 in scholarships relating to distributed ledger technology. The Maltese government has also implemented various national artificial intelligence strategies with the aim of promoting investment, innovation and adoption, and attracting skilled talent to the island.
3 Cryptocurrencies
3.1 How are cryptocurrencies and/or virtual currencies defined and regulated in your jurisdiction?
Maltese law groups tokens into four main categories, as follows:
- Virtual tokens: A form of digital medium recordation which has no utility, value or application outside the distributed ledger technology (DLT) platform on which it was issued, and which may only be redeemed for funds on such platform directly by the issuer. These are commonly known as ‚Äòutility tokens'. Utility tokens are not traded on exchanges.
- Electronic money: Electronically (including magnetically) stored monetary value as represented by a claim on the issuer which is issued on receipt of funds for the purpose of making payment transactions (eg, stablecoins backed by fiat).
- Financial instruments (security token): The meaning here is the same as that set out in the second schedule of the Maltese Investment Services Act. These include instruments such as transferable securities, money market instruments and units in collective investment schemes.
- Virtual financial assets: Any digital medium recordation that is used as a digital medium of exchange unit or an account or store of value, but which is not electronic money, a financial instrument or a virtual token (eg, Bitcoin, Ethereum).
3.2 What anti-money laundering provisions apply to cryptocurrencies?
Under Maltese law, the requirements of the Fifth Money-Laundering Directive apply to crypto-related service providers.
3.3 What consumer protection provisions apply to cryptocurrencies?
Usually, persons launching and registering a white paper must address risks involved with purchase of such tokens and include refund mechanisms in case the promises set out in the white paper are not delivered. The licence requirements for service providers such as exchanges include implementing certain procedures and employing personnel to cater for complaints handling, incident reporting and customer care. These must also be made available on service providers' websites.
3.4 How are cryptocurrencies treated from a tax perspective?
In November 2018 the Malta Commissioner for Revenue issued tax guidelines on the income tax, stamp duty and value added tax (VAT) treatment of transactions or arrangements involving DLT assets.
In relation to initial coin offerings (ICOs), the guidelines state that proceeds from token generation events will not be taxed.
For the purposes of the guidelines, tokens are divided into financial tokens, utility tokens and hybrid tokens (bearing characteristics of both). In relation to financial tokens (security tokens), for income tax purposes, returns derived from security tokens ‚Äì whether in crypto or in fiat ‚Äì should be treated as income. In relation to the transfer of tokens, the tax treatment depends on whether the transfer is a trading transaction or the transfer of a capital asset. Trading profits are taxable; however, capital gains are taxable only insofar as the token meets the definition of a ‚Äòsecurity'.
In terms of security token offerings aimed at raising capital, this will not give rise to any VAT implications, since the raising of finance itself does not constitute the supply of goods or services.
3.5 What regulatory requirements apply to a cryptocurrency trader/exchange?
Service providers of exchange platforms will be treated like normal companies and will thus be taxed under the normal tax rules applicable to Maltese companies. For VAT purposes, the provision of a trading or exchange service against payment for a user transaction fee constitutes the supply of services for consideration and will therefore fall under the Maltese VAT regime, unless an exemption applies. Tax exemptions for trading/exchange platforms depend on the nature of the service being supplied. Relevant factors include whether the service being provided is purely technological.
Trading profits are taxable; however, capital gains are taxable only insofar as the token meets the definition of a ‚Äòsecurity' set out in the Income Tax Act (eg, Bitcoin and Ethereum do not qualify as securities).
3.6 How are initial coin offerings and securities token offerings defined and regulated in your jurisdiction?
ICOs are defined as a way to raise capital through the sale of tokens or coins to the public. Tokens which are not classified as securities are classified as ICOs. In order to launch and sell tokens through an ICO, an issuer must draft, register (with the Malta Financial Services Authority) and launch a white paper that complies with local laws.
A security token is a traditional security as is described in traditional securities legislation, including commodities (eg, gold and other precious metals), shares and bonds whereby the rights and obligations of token holders are embedded in token form and transactions recorded on the blockchain (eg, dividend payments).
When it comes to stablecoins, if the stablecoin's business model involves backing the token by a fiat currency (to ensure stability) and exhibits similar characteristics to electronic money, then it may be necessary to apply for a financial institution licence. Many EU jurisdictions are in agreement on this point.
4 Smart contracts
4.1 Can a smart contract satisfy the legal requirements of a legal contract under the laws of your jurisdiction? What will be considered when making this determination?
The prerequisites for the validity of a contract under Maltese law are as follows:
- capacity to contract;
- consent of the parties;
- causa ‚Äì subject matter; and
- lawful consideration.
The absence of any one of these requirements will render the contract null and void in the eyes of the law.
In Malta, registered smart contracts must comply with the Malta Digital Innovation Authority (MDIA) and Innovative Technological Arrangements Services (ITAS) regulations. These regulations ensure that certain safeguards are in place to prevent material loss to users and material breaches of the law. For example, the regulations state that there should be an in-built technological feature to enable a technical administrator to intervene in case of material breach. They must also specify that the courts of Malta have jurisdiction (even though users will be located all over the world). The technology must further include an in-built feature in relation to alternative dispute resolution ‚Äì providing a quick, cheap and efficient electronic procedure to allow that users from all over the world to enforce their rights.
The Maltese Civil Code will soon be amended to include smart contracts (as defined in the MDIA and ITAS regulations) in the definitions.
4.2 Are there any regulatory or governmental guidelines or policies within your jurisdiction which provide guidance on regulating/defining smart contracts?
Yes, the MDIA and ITAS regulations focus on this technology.
4.3 What parts of traditional contract might smart contracts be able to replace?
Smart contracts are agreements in digital form that are self-executing and self-enforcing, based on the fulfilment and verification of certain conditions. Such processes afford considerable efficiency, due to features such as automation, removal of middlemen/the human element, and an auditing function. Smart contracts have become quite advanced and are being built with features that allow for the reversal of transactions or wrongfully obtained funds and dispute resolution mechanisms.
Smart contracts can replace traditional contracts in situations where the certainty of a result can be achieved. Smart contract verification responds to binary situations (yes or no), but not to situations which are open to interpretation or which can be adjudicated based on retrospective events.
4.4 What parts of traditional contracts might smart contracts be unable to replace?
There are certain situations in which smart contracts should not be used. For example, a contract may include phrases which are open to interpretation, such as ‚Äòbest efforts', ‚Äògood faith' or ‚Äòwhat a reasonable person would do'; these subjective phrases are difficult to reduce to computer code. Certain situations might also still require human intervention. As smart contracts are programmed to respond to a set of rules, how can one expect such rules to capture all possible scenarios, thus removing the need for lawyers or formal dispute resolution altogether? While smart contracts are generally effective and efficient, they are not omnipotent.
Furthermore, smart contracts are programmed to execute transactions based on the design of the smart contract code when it was created; so unless such code includes an option for re-negotiation, the parties are bound by the contractual terms and the possibility to modify the terms is excluded.
4.5 What issues might present themselves in your jurisdiction with regard to judicial enforcement of smart contracts?
Off-chain enforcement may be required in the event of certain smart contract breaches. This may cause problems where pseudonymity is coupled with an international aspect. This is why the identification of the parties that consent to jurisdictional clauses in smart contracts is imperative. If the parties wish to remain private, smart contracts cannot rectify or resolve breaches and disputes may arise.
4.6 What are some practical considerations that parties should consider when drafting a smart contract?
Parties in blockchain nodes may incur legal liability ‚Äì especially if the network applies proof of authority (ie, when block validators stake their reputation instead of coins). What happens if there is a bug in the code, which makes an unfair or devious transaction resemble a legitimate transaction as far as the code is concerned? Should the smart contract address the liability and type of recourse in case of such risks? Will the developers of the code be liable?
Off-chain enforcement may be required in the event of certain smart contract breaches. This may cause problems where pseudonymity is coupled with an international context. This is why the identification of the parties that consent to jurisdictional clauses in smart contracts is imperative. If the parties wish to remain private, smart contracts cannot rectify or resolve breaches and disputes may arise.
4.7 How will the foregoing considerations differ when smart contracts are running on a private versus public blockchain?
The main difference between public and private blockchains is the level of access granted to participants. Public blockchains are decentralised and completely open and transparent, allowing anyone to participate by verifying or adding data to the blockchain. Private blockchains are permissioned, which controls user access to information. A private blockchain network requires an invitation and must be validated either by the network or by a set of pre-defined rules established by the network. Only entities participating in a particular transaction will have knowledge of and access to it ‚Äì other entities will not have access to it.
As private blockchains are run by private individuals, there is a higher risk of fraudulent behaviour, since powerful actors may make decisions in favour of persons within the group.
On private blockchains, the possibility for review and audit is also limited, since permission is required to access data. When it comes to public blockchains, anyone can run a node and access the ledger to review and audit it, making it more transparent and reducing the risk of malicious behaviour.
Private blockchains may be completely centralised and may thus allow for certain corrections and changes to data stored on the chain which may not be possible on public blockchains, as these require consensus. From a legal perspective, a private blockchain allows for a governance structure to be set up that can correct faulty data and account for situations where legal enforcement comes into play. However, since such a structure may be centralised, this runs counter to the advantages afforded by blockchain technology, which is based on openness, trust, transparency and the absence of middlemen.
5 Data and privacy
5.1 What specific challenges or concerns does blockchain present from a data protection/privacy perspective?
In their current state, most smart contracts are not entirely confidential. Certain advantages of blockchain may simultaneously be some of the biggest drawbacks when it comes to data protection legislation. For example, there is uncertainty as to whether blockchain violates the EU General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), as an immutable ledger is incompatible with the right to be forgotten. Also, if parties are not comfortable with the lack of confidentiality, then public smart contracts may not be a viable option to replace traditional contracts.
Further, the development of blockchain projects should include careful assessment as to what sort of data is being stored and whether it could be considered to be personal data.
A common workaround is to store the main data outside of the blockchain (on a sidechain) and use blockchain for verification, time-stamping and ordering.
Also, zero-knowledge proofs can be used to ensure that only non-personal data can be derived from an entry on a blockchain.
5.2 What potential advantages can blockchain offer in the data protection/privacy context?
The nature of blockchain technology, which has no centralised storage of private data, means that there is no single point of failure, which greatly increases the security of the system. It allows users to digitise and store assets in a way that ensures they cannot be copied, tampered with or duplicated without permission through the use of cryptography. Thus, security is a key advantage of this technology.
Further, although some transactions may be pseudonymous, creating a risk of potential criminal activity, chain analytics can be used to trace such transactions.
6 Cybersecurity
6.1 What specific challenges or concerns does blockchain present from a cybersecurity perspective?
The cybersecurity challenges include the following:
- Key management: Private keys are a direct means of authorising activities from an account, so if an adversary were to get hold of them, any assets secured in a wallet could be compromised.
- Cryptography: Most blockchains rely on cryptography, which generates public and private keys to operate. Some of the programs that generate these keys have been identified as weak.
- Privacy: In a permissionless ledger, all counterparties can download the ledger, which means that they could attempt to explore a person's transaction history. One potential solution is hyperledger technology, which can allow for certain customisation and security protections.
6.2 What potential advantages can blockchain offer in the cybersecurity context?
Blockchain operates on a distributed network and uses complex encryption methods and algorithms to verify and store data. These features provide strong security elements.
Since blockchain is decentralised and has no single centralised point of entry, certain attacks ‚Äì such as distributed denial-of-service attacks ‚Äì which target centralised systems are harder to effect, given that hackers will have to gain access to multiple nodes in the system.
Since data cannot be removed from a blockchain, new or edited data is added on top of old blocks and all changes are visible. This makes it harder to tamper with data.
6.3 What tools and measures could be implemented to mitigate cybersecurity risk?
Code reviews are essential to test vulnerabilities and ensure application integrity.
Global consensus and implementation regarding a standard set of best practice rules for blockchain development are needed.
7 Intellectual property
7.1 What specific challenges or concerns does blockchain present from an IP perspective?
The driving factor behind blockchain's swift development is the code's open source nature, meaning that people are free to copy and improve on it. This was a deliberate decision ‚Äì to disallow the use of copyright law to protect the source code, in contrast to proprietary software.
Blockchain has changed conventional ways of thinking. Open source technologies (the Internet, the World Wide Web and now blockchain) are flourishing in the absence of IP protection.
7.2 What type of IP protection can blockchain developers obtain?
Unfortunately, the challenges presented by the Internet mean that intellectual property is often copied, modified, shared and stolen around the world, resulting in the owner losing control.
In terms of potential IP protection, due to the ‚Äòproof of authorship' protocol, blockchain could provide the authors of digital data with evidence that proves their authorship. Blockchain in itself constitutes evidence of IP registration, thereby affording IP protection. Blockchain ledgers create time-stamped records that cannot be retroactively altered.
7.3 What are the best open-source platforms that could be used to protect developers' innovations?
Ethereum, Corda and HydraChain.
7.4 What potential advantages can blockchain offer in the IP context?
Proof of authorship, since blockchain ledgers create time-stamped records that cannot be retroactively altered.
8 Trends and predictions
8.1 How do you think the regulatory landscape in your jurisdiction will evolve in the blockchain space over the next two years? Are any pending changes currently being considered?
The latest developments include:
- the enactment of the Virtual Financial Assets Act, which regulates issuers and service providers of crypto and blockchain-related business; and
- the publication of a consultation paper on security token offerings (STO).
It is expected that more STO issuers will emerge as a result of the increase in investments and continued advancements in distributed ledger technology (DLT) based infrastructure in the capital markets space.
8.2 What regulatory changes would you like your jurisdiction to implement to further advance the blockchain industry?
The crowdfunding licensing requirements could be improved and clarified in order to promote crowdfunding and encourage those seeking to host a crowdfunding platform to apply for a licence. Greater incentives and accessibility are needed when it comes to raising capital. In the new token era, a few new security token crowdfunding platforms have been launched (eg, TokenMarket); conceptually, this is a great idea for securities issuers that are seeking to raise reasonably small amounts of capital (eg, under ‚Ç¨5 million). However, the infrastructure is still being developed with regard to the tokenisation of securities (eg, primary markets, secondary markets); although many players are gradually making the shift to DLT.
8.3 What is the largest impediment within your jurisdiction to the adoption of blockchain technology?
It is difficult to speak of blockchain impediments on a jurisdictional basis, as blockchain is designed to facilitate global business and transactions. While generic standards for information sharing exist (eg, ISO/IEC 27010), when it comes to blockchain and DLT incident management, as yet there are no standards on how these technologies could be used to support such models. That said, the technologies are still maturing and evolving. Perhaps once a few clear leaders have emerged (in terms of adoption) and the level of advancement of the technology has become clearer, the authorities will move to set some global standards.
9 Tips and traps
9.1 What are your top tips for effective use of blockchain technologies in your jurisdiction and what potential sticking points would you highlight?
- Ensure a high quality of code creation and undertake regular testing to mitigate risks in areas such as privacy and data management.
- Remain legally compliant (to the furthest extent possible).
- Recognise the importance of interoperability.

- Q. Father died recently. There was no will. Will we need a lawyer to procede in probate court. There are 3 siblings.
-
- A: More information is need to fully answer this question, but the short answer is "no", you may proceed through the probate process without a lawyer. It is referred to a filing "pro se." The process is mostly guided/controlled by the laws in the Texas Probate Code. Having stated that, I have to say I think it would typically be a mistake to not hire a lawyer through the probate process, especially if a parent dies without a Will. There are different types of probate approaches when a person dies without a Will (Intestacy). An heirship affidavit, a small estate affidavit (recommended if the situation qualifies), an heirship proceeding, an independent administration or a dependent administration (if there are estate debts difficult to pay). In your situation, is you mother still alive? If so, did your father have children from other marriages (it makes a difference and effects how property is inherited)? What type of property (real and personal) did your father have when he died? In most, if not all Texas counties, the Court will require that an attorney ad litem be appointed when a person dies without a Will and you seek a probate administration. Another factor in how to proceed is how long ago your father died. If he died more than four years ago, his estate is no longer eligible to have an administrator appointed. Those are some of your initial considerations.

Meganoid is a retro style platformer for Andrioid and iPhone by Orange Pixel. Aliens have invaded the planet and you are the only hero left to stop them. It‚Äôs free to download on the former so I‚Äôve given it a go and here are some quick thoughts.
I was very wary beginning the game given that I was playing this on my keyboard-less smartphone. I do not like touch only controls at all in anything traditional. Not having feedback from controls for me is just very detrimental to a game like this, which is a twitchy platformer where every jump counts. So I was surprised that the game controls quite well here. It‚Äôs very simplistic given that there‚Äôs only one jump button and a d-pad. The bottom screen controls don‚Äôt get in the way as long as you don‚Äôt have giant hands and while they can never be as precise as physical buttons, they do the job in game. As I said, this is the type of game where every jump counts and I‚Äôve never found myself blaming the controls for the many times I‚Äôve died. A cool feature too is that if you have an Android phone with a keyboard or D-Pad in the Xperia Play‚Äôs case then you can use that too.
As you may have gotten a hint of from the death comment, it‚Äôs also one of those perfection style, fast movement platformers most familiar to me in Super Meat Boy. While it‚Äôs not nearly as fast as that is, there about 90 levels that can be completed in the beginning in about 10-20 seconds and later 30-60 seconds. You‚Äôre also competing for a high score and stars here as collecting all of the diamonds in a level will get you a star (not all of them are in plain sight), as will completing a level within the time limit.
Of course, it‚Äôs not as easy as I make that sound. It is to begin with, with only minor pits to cross and the occasional enemy, but the later levels only get more and more complicated as the environments also change.. To make things easier there‚Äôs a three life system and when you die it‚Äôll remember what you accomplished, but it still sends you to the beginning of the level and if you lose all three lives, you have to start the level again from scratch. The good thing is that like these good twitch platformers, it doesn‚Äôt get frustrating and really gets you into that mood of one more try or one more level. The fact that it‚Äôs on a smartphone only helps really, as it‚Äôs on a system that‚Äôs designed to be something used for a few minutes while you‚Äôre bored or on the bus. Or on the toilet. You can blast through a few levels, have a little fun, and get back to whatever else you‚Äôre doing.
The only problem I have is that the character is useless against enemies without a box. Boxes can be found in levels with enemies and they are automatically thrown. This is handy, but it completely breaks away from the conventional idea of jumping on your enemies to kill them. Even Super Meat Boy had that. It‚Äôs not really even a problem, just a design choice, but if you die in a level while holding a box, then it‚Äôs lost forever until you start from scratch. In some levels, areas are impassable because there are enemies in the way, so you literally have to kill yourself until you run out of lives. It‚Äôs more of a level design fault for some levels which does need addressing. Either that or boxes should reappear after every death.
And that‚Äôs all I have to say about Meganoid. It‚Äôs a genuinely fun platformer to kill some time with and has some lovely pixel graphics to boot. It‚Äôs not as mindbogglingly devious as Super Meat Boy but it‚Äôs not just a platformer with a win button because it‚Äôs on a smartphone. Package that in with 90 levels and replay value and you‚Äôve got yourself a time killer that‚Äôs very much worth it for free or for $0.99 on iPhone. You can find the game on each platform‚Äôs respective marketplaces.Category: Kids

New Jersey officials have suspended the license of a physician whose aesthetic medicine practice allegedly poses a "clear and imminent danger" to the public, as reported in NJ.com.
The physician, Muhammad A. Mirza, MD, is a board-certified internal medicine doctor and owner of Mirza Aesthetics, which has its main New Jersey office in Cedar Grove, a township in Essex County. The practice also leases space in New York, Pennsylvania, and Connecticut, where at press time Mirza was still licensed to practice medicine.
The acting New Jersey attorney general said that Mirza had deviated from the accepted standards of medical care in at least four key areas: he practiced in ways that put his patients in bodily danger; he lacked the formal training in and an adequate knowledge of aesthetic medicine; he practiced in office settings that inspectors found to be subpar; and he failed to safely store medical supplies or maintain proper medical records.
In one instance singled out by the attorney general's office, Mirza used an injectable dermal filler to enhance a patient's penis. As a result of that nonsurgical procedure, the patient needed to be rushed to a nearby hospital, where he underwent two emergency surgical interventions. Contacted by the emergency department doctor, Mirza allegedly failed to disclose the name of the filler he used, thereby complicating the patient's recovery, according to the board complaint.
Mirza's other alleged breaches of professional conduct include the following:
Failure to wear a mask or surgical gloves during procedures
Failure to keep electronic medical records of any kind
Improper, off-label use of an injectable dermal filler in proximity to patients' eyes
Improper, off-label use of an injectable dermal filler for breast enhancement
Use of a certain injectable dermal filler without first testing for skin allergies
In addition, site inspections of Mirza's offices turned up substandard conditions. On April 23, 2021, in response to numerous patient complaints, the Enforcement Bureau of the Division of Consumer Affairs inspected Mirza's Summit, New Jersey office, one of several in the state.
Among other things, the inspection uncovered the following:
The medical office was one large room. A curtain separated the reception area and the examination/treatment area, which consisted of only chairs and a fold-away table.
"Duffle bags" were used to store injectable fillers. No medical storage refrigerators were observed.
COVID-19 protocols were not followed. Inspectors could identify no barrier between receptionist and patients, no posted mask mandate, no social distancing policy, and no COVID-19 screening measures.
In addition to temporarily suspending Mirza's license, the medical board has prohibited him from treating New Jersey patients in any of the out-of-state locations where he's licensed to practice medicine.
Prosecutors have urged other patients who believe they've been injured by Mirza Aesthetics to file a complaint with the State Division of Consumer Affairs.
Mirza has agreed to the temporary suspension of his medical license, pending a hearing before an administrative law judge. In addition to facing civil penalties for each of the counts against him, he could be held responsible for paying investigative costs, attorney fees, trial costs, and other costs.
Doctor's Failure to Diagnose Results in Mega Award
In what is believed to be a record verdict in a wrongful death suit in Volusia County, Florida, a jury awarded $6.46 million to the family of a woman who died from an undiagnosed heart infection after being transferred from a local hospital, according to a report in The Daytona Beach News-Journal, among other news outlets.
In March 2016, Laura Staib went to what was then Florida Hospital DeLand ‚Äî now AdventHealth DeLand ‚Äî complaining of a variety of symptoms. There, she was examined by a doctor who was a member of a nearby cardiology group. His diagnosis: congestive heart failure, pneumonia, and sepsis. Transferred to a long-term care facility, Staib died 4 days later.
In their complaint against the cardiologist and his cardiology group, family members alleged that the doctor failed to identify Staib's main problem: viral myocarditis.
"This was primarily a heart failure problem and a heart infection that was probably causing some problems in the lungs...," said the attorney representing the family. "A virus was attacking her heart, and they missed it," he said. Claims against the hospital and other doctors were eventually resolved and dismissed.
The jury's verdict will be appealed, said the attorney representing the cardiologist.
He argues that his client "did not cause that woman's death. She died of an overwhelming lung infection...acute respiratory distress syndrome, caused by an overwhelming pneumonia that got worse after she was transferred to a facility where [my client] doesn't practice."
The bulk of the award will be in compensation for family members' future pain and suffering and for other noneconomic damages.
Botched Outpatient Procedure Leaves Woman Disfigured
In early September, a patient was allegedly administered the wrong drug during an outpatient procedure on her hand. She sued the Austin, Texas, hospital and surgical center where that procedure was performed, according to a story in Law/Street.
On January 9, 2020, Jessica Arguello went to HCA Healthcare's South Austin Surgery Center to undergo a right-hand first metacarpophalangeal arthrodesis (fusion) and neuroma excision. In her suit against the hospital, Arguello claims that while her surgeon was preparing to close the incision after having irrigated the site, he called for a syringe containing an anesthetic. He was instead handed a syringe that contained formalin, the chemical used to preserve specimens for later review.
The mistake, Arguello claims, caused her to suffer massive chemical burns and necrosis of her flesh, which required four additional surgeries. In the end, she says, her right hand is disfigured and has limited mobility.
She adds that her injuries were preventable. Standard surgical procedure typically forbids chemicals such as formalin to be included among items on the prep tray. In addition to other compensation, she seeks damages for past and future medical expenses and past and future pain and suffering.
At press time, the defendants had not responded to Arguello's complaint..

Are there any flaws in the Cummins Duram?
When to test the fuel system in a Duramax?
On a good fuel system the fuel pump can produce maximum system pressure during cranking. If the engine won‚Äôt start and actual fuel rail pressure is low during cranking, the supply side should be checked before testing the high side. Start by first stroking the hand pump.

Where is the CP3 injection pump in a Duramax?..
Where does the fuel go in a Duramax?
There is no lift pump in the fuel tanks or on the frame. The fuel passes through the base plate of the fuel injector control module (FICM) to cool the module. From the FICM the fuel flows to the fuel filter assembly, which combines a water separator, a prime pump and a filter element.
What‚Äôs the normal range for a Duramax injector?
The normal ranges for automatic transmissions is +/- 4 mm3 in park or neutral, and it can go as high as +/- 6 mm3 in gear. Starting on 2006 all Duramax injectors use an injection quantity adjustment number on top. This is established by Bosch during testing.
Are there any problems with the Duramax engine?.
Why is oil shooting out of the oil fill tube?
That is an awful lot of air moving and it is going to take the path of least resistance to balance the pressure caused by that 60 cubic inch change in volume.

Most likely already know, you will find quite a few differences between contact lenses and eye-glasses. Glasses have already been around a great deal longer than contacts, though most people choose to wear connections instead of glasses. Contacts are becoming popular over the years, proving to be the best option to wearing heavy glasses.
When you compare associates against spectacles, there are several things that jump out like a sore thumb. The first big difference in the two is the visibility. Glasses provide good the front vision, even though their peripheral vision is fairly poor. Contacts on the other hand supply great visibility, including peripheral. You won‚Äôt always be hindered in order to looking straight ahead, as disposable lenses allow you to seem anywhere you want without the problems.
Another major difference is the weight. Spectacles are not comfortable weight about both your ear and your confront. They also must be tightened on the frequent basis, along with adjusting. Associates on the other hand may weigh anything more. When you wear contacts you should not worry about tensing them or worry about them constantly sliding your face which may be very bothersome.
Glasses are also seen to fog up frequently, and perhaps they are very distracting during any sort of sports you play. Contacts however , may fog up. You can accomplish any activity you choose and not having to worry about them. They won‚Äôt fall off or slip down the nose as you run, nor will that they limit your skill when you play sports.
Another awful thing regarding glasses is the fact they need to meet what you put on. If you have casual frames, they could not suit your evening clothing. The colors might also clash, the industry bad point for those who seek style. Contrary to glasses, contact lenses will supplement everything you put on, for the simple fact that they will don‚Äôt stick out.
However are quite some differences involving the two, they certainly have some things in keeping as well. The two glasses and contacts need cleaning and careful handling. You‚Äôll need to aerosol your spectacles and clean them off a few times each day. Contacts must be cleaned as well, before you put them in and soaked in answer when you aren‚Äôt using them. You can even need to make use of eye drops as well during the day when using contacts, especially if your eye start to dry out.
Spectacles and contact lenses can both equally correct astigmatism as well. In case you have astigmatism, they even make either glasses or associates. Astigmatism can be an odd cornea shape that impairs eyesight, common with older people. Although a lot of people think that only glasses will correct this problem, contacts can easily fix the problem as well.
The good thing about the two contacts and glasses is the fact that they are both affordable. You can find contacts and glasses in very affordable rates. Considering the fact that you will likely be putting them on for the rest of your life, they will be the best purchase that you‚Äôll ever make. Over the years, you will your money back and then some for every single day you wear both of them. No matter what one of the two you decide to select, you are sure to get the vision you need.You.

It makes for interesting reading (hurray for fun anecdotes!) and addresses a lot of the common issues that couples identify (be they dating, engaged, married, or on the verge of divorce) when they use Money Habitudes.
Anderson draws a lot on the work of Dr. Jeffrey Dew, a researcher at Utah State University. We often talk about Jeff‚Äôs research within the context of money, finances, dating and marriage. And as a bonus, because we travel in similar circles, we‚Äôve gotten to run into Jeff at a few conferences, most recently at the Financial Therapy Association annual meeting at UGA. He‚Äôs a smart guy with a really interesting line of research he‚Äôs been pushing forward. Probably the simple stat of his that we cite the most is that money fights predict divorce rates:
Couples who reported disagreeing about finance once a week were over 30 percent more likely to get divorced than couples who reported disagreeing about finances a few times a month.
In his paper, Bank on it: Thrifty Couples are the Happiest, he finds that when a spouse feels the other spends their money foolishly, it increases the likelihood of divorce by 45%.
Of course, if money is an issue in a relationship (and when is it not?), it‚Äôs important that couples are able to talk about the difficult topic, understand and respect each other and resolve the issue. That‚Äôs what Money Habitudes does, and does so for couples on their own and is also used by couples counselors, financial advisors and the like. At Utah State, the cards are used in a wide variety of ways by professors with their students and by a number of educators in the Cooperative Extension program who do community programming with money and relationships.LynQ, the Smart Compass that Keeps Everyone Together, is Now Commercially Available

How the Environmental Movement Has Evolved
The history of the environmental movement is vast and nuanced, but there are three notable developments that have influenced the trajectory of environmental activism, particularly in the United States: the conservation movement, the environmental revolution, and the environmental justice movement. Each of these continue to iterate and evolve today, working hand-in-hand to enhance our understanding of our natural world and protect its resources.
Conservation
In the latter half of the 1800s, a new ideology emerged: conservation. Unlike its predecessor, preservation, which seeks to shield nature from human influence, conservation focuses on protecting natural areas and resources for human use and enjoyment.
The growth of the conservation movement was partly a reaction to the environmental concerns of the industrial revolution, and also a result of nature‚Äôs literary debut in romanticism. Writers and naturalists like Henry David Thoreau, John Muir, William Wordsworth, and Aldo Leopold wrote extensively about man‚Äôs connection to nature, inspiring the public to acknowledge the importance of protecting the natural world. Americans began to take an interest in their wilderness within the context of a new paradigm: the American West was not merely a frontier to conquer, but a natural landscape to document, protect, and savor.
Eventually, the conservation movement led to the founding of the national park system in the United States. Yellowstone National Park, established in 1872, was the first protected area of its kind in the world. The growth of the US park system prompted other countries to follow suit: Australia created Royal National Park in 1879, South Africa announced Kruger National Park in 1898, and Sweden established nine national parks in 1909.
Established in 1929, Wyoming‚Äôs Grand Tetons National Park is one of many national parks in the United States.
The Environmental Revolution
The 1960s and ‚Äò70s saw a steep increase in public concern over the environment, particularly in the United States. The shift in public perception was marked by the publication, in 1962, of Rachel Carson‚Äôs bestselling book, Silent Spring, in which she revealed how pesticides damage the environment and harm local wildlife.
As the public became increasingly aware of and concerned about pollution, loss of natural resources, chemical use, nuclear testing, oil spills, species extinction, suburban sprawl, and freeway construction, grassroots environmental movements started to gain popularity. Organizations like the Scenic Hudson Preservation Conference and the Sierra Club united communities to protest the construction of hydroelectric plants and dams in natural areas, setting a powerful precedent for other grassroots groups.
Throughout the 1960s and ‚Äò70s, Congress passed a slew of environmental legislation, including the Clean Air Act, the Wilderness Act, the Clean Water Act, the Marine Mammal Protection Act, the Endangered Species Act, and the National Environmental Policy Act. These new statutes enjoyed bipartisan support in Congress and were signed by presidents of both political parties.
Earth Day also began in 1970. The first celebration‚Äîprompted by a 1969 oil spill in Santa Barbara, California, that blighted the coast and killed thousands of marine animals‚Äîinspired nearly 20 million Americans to hit the streets to protest environmental destruction. Today, the Earth Day Network seeks to maintain the momentum established 50 years ago to safeguard our planet.
The Environmental Justice Movement
Meanwhile, the US industrial sector and the policies that bolstered it had another important reckoning. After decades of planning, building, and operating noxious industries in underprivileged communities across the country, a pattern of environmental discrimination began to emerge. In the 1980s, environmental consciousness expanded to include the concept of environmental justice, the idea that people of all cultures, races, and ethnicities deserve equal and fair treatment with respect to environmental policies and regulations.
Many historians consider a 1982 protest in Warren County, North Carolina, to be the starting point for the environmental justice movement in the US. More than 500 African American civil rights activists gathered to protest a polychlorinated biphenyl (PCB) landfill located in a predominantly Black community.
Then, in 1987, a landmark study found that over 15 million African Americans, eight million people of Hispanic origin, and half of all Asian/Pacific Islanders and Indigenous Americans resided in communities with at least one abandoned or uncontained toxic waste site. The study illustrated the degree to which social issues are inherently intertwined with environmental issues and shed light on an unfortunate truth: marginalized communities often suffer the most from destructive environmental practices. In fact, race was the most significant correlation in the location of toxic waste sites.
Though marginalized communities have been fighting for their environments for centuries, the environmental justice movement has been slow to take hold in the larger public consciousness. Today, many Indigenous groups are still battling harmful ideologies such as fortress conservation, the theory that true biodiversity is only possible when you remove human influence from an ecosystem. Not only does this concept of conservation exclude Indigenous people from their own land, but it fails to take into account the fact that Indigenous communities are responsible for protecting 80% of the world‚Äôs biodiversity‚Äîand are often the best stewards of natural resources.

Grassroots Environmental Activism Today
Today‚Äôs grassroots environmental movement has evolved to embrace the current zeitgeist: that environmental activism must be inclusive, accessible, and global to be effective. This is very much the philosophy that inspired the founding of the Goldman Environmental Prize, in 1989, and continues to motivate it.
Thanks to the countless grassroots environmental leaders (including 206 Goldman Prize winners to date) who have spearheaded movements and advocated for change, more and more people today are aware of environmental issues‚Äîin their own communities and across the world. And, as the understanding of the existential threat posed by climate change grows, a greater number of individuals are taking an interest in environmental activism.
In fact, in a 2018 Pew Research Center study, half of all countries surveyed said they consider global climate change to be a major threat. This widespread and growing interest in the environment means that grassroots movements have become increasingly diverse, including people of all ages, races, nationalities, and backgrounds.
Social media has also played an integral role in the popularity and accessibility of grassroots activism. Online petitions, digital campaigns, trending hashtags, and helpful infographics have made it easy for everyday citizens to educate their social circles about environmental causes and motivate them to act. And, thanks to viral social media coverage of events like the Dakota Access Pipeline protests and the controversial shrinking of national monuments in Utah, more individuals are recognizing the key roles that Indigenous people play in protecting the environment.
Notable Grassroots Environmental Movements
There are many examples of grassroots environmental campaigns, but three movements‚Äîall led by Goldman Prize winners‚Äîhave been particularly influential and instructive.
In the 1980s, lifelong environmental activist and inaugural Goldman Prize winner Lois Gibbs (United States, 1990) organized her community to speak out against the chemical waste buried in her neighborhood in Niagara Falls, New York. She formed the Love Canal Homeowners Association and pushed local, state, and federal governments repeatedly (United States, 2002) used grassroots campaigns to protect the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge in Alaska‚Äîand its native caribou‚Äîfrom oil drilling. They educated Congress about the Arctic‚Äôs importance, organized local assemblies, and helped native communities develop their own sustainable sources of energy. Their early and continued advocacy helped pave the way for organizing by Indigenous communities in Alaska and elsewhere. In June 2021, the US government suspended oil and gas leases in the Arctic Refuge, a testament to the enduring effect of Gwich‚Äôin grassroots activism.
Every One of Us Can Effect Change
Getting involved in a grassroots environmental movement is one of the most effective and accessible ways to drive environmental progress. Success depends on everyone playing their part‚Äîfrom the leaders who spearhead campaigns to the individuals who sign petitions, donate money, and spread awareness. The beauty of grassroots activism is that everyone is welcome, and there is a role for each to play.
If you want to participate in environmental change, look out for opportunities in your own community to get involved‚Äîand amplify the work and voices of others. Visit our website to learn more about this year‚Äôs Prize winners and find out how you can support their causes.3D Digital Game Art

Walmart to Streamline Divisions to Improve Speed
Walmart is updating its U.S. operations to better reflect today‚Äôs business.
The big-box retailer is consolidating from six business units to four and from 44 regional managers to 36.
Sources close to the matter say the current restructuring will look similar to the operating structure the company had three years ago, according to Reuters.
‚ÄúThe structure we are putting in place will help improve communication and execution, streamline decision-making and help us accelerate our pace of change,‚Äù according to a company statement.
This latest development, is just the retailer‚Äôs most recent attempt to become more competitive. In February, the company updated its buying policy, allowing brick-and-mortar buyers to also approve items for the company‚Äôs site. The change removed redundancies for suppliers that sold both stores and online.
Walmart is just one in a string of retailers looking for ways to speed things up. Last week, Macy‚Äôs addressed its new merchandising strategy, which resulted in the consolidation of three departments. The changes there were influenced by the company‚Äôs ability to trim development cycles down to as little as 8 weeks for its core private label brand. Macy‚Äôs took the model it had developed for INC and extended across the whole company.
Retailers have been focused on speed as a way of delivering freshness to stores more often and an avenue to supplying the right product at the right times.
In April, Walmart laid off several hundred corporate employees to cut costs and funnel funds into its locations and online operations. This followed nearly 1,000 job cuts in January in Bentonville, Arkansas and California.
Despite these layoffs, the company plans to add more than 30,000 jobs this year, including e-commerce and retail positions.Hidden monasteries on Lake Tana
Thanks to their remote location,.
Monasteries on the islands

The monastery of Debre Maryam is one of the newer monasteries of Lake Tana, having been built by Emperor Tewodros in the 19th century. A friendly priest welcomes all visitors and is happy to show you the ancient manuscripts stored there.

Daga Estefanos
Set on a hill around 100m above the lake, a short trek up a winding path brings you to one of the most sacred monasteries, the monastery of Daga Est.
Tana Cherkos
Tana Cher
Sadly, although it is said to be one of the most beautiful and atmospheric of the monasteries of Lake Tana, Kebran Gabriel is no longer open to the public.

The round roof is supported by twelve pillars made from carved stones symbolising the twelve apostles.

The monastery is highly decorated with beautifully painted, colourful and vibrant frescoes depicting Ethiopian saints and the history of the Ethiopian-Orthodox Church. Both men and women are permitted to enter and there is also a small museum, the Zege Satekela Museum, for visitors to learn about hand-crafted objects and musical instruments that are still used be the local communities today.
Bete Maryam Monastery

There is a stress on the importance of utilities for your organization. Every business out there has a limit for the employees that they can get; however, when the number gets to the high levels, choosing to use utility services would be an ideal means of keeping financial records. Tax payment is an essential thing for any business or organization out there, and so on. It is necessary to have the right utilities as there are tax obligations that are required to be documented after a period. A business may have a hard time trying to provide the records for the taxation purpose. This is mainly because some of the information cannot be estimated since they are offered manually.
It is vital that the business understands that the use of utilities has its ideal impacts on the business and so choosing to use it would be one of the best choices that the business makes. Before choosing to create utilities, there are those things that a business is expected to factor in so that the choice made is the right one for the business. There are many positive impacts of creating utilities that the business may be entitled to when it chooses to go that way, and so choosing to create the utility services would be a rational decision to be made by the business. In this website, a business may read more on the benefits of utilities for businesses; click for more information here!
The first thing that the business may gain from creating utilities is that the employees‚Äô payment would be made on time when it is time for them to get their payment. When it comes to a business paying the workers, there are some inconveniences that may be experienced. To avoid all these inconveniences, choosing to create utilities for your business would be an ideal means of timely payment of the employees and so on. For most of the employees out there, the timely payment is a great deal and would mean a lot to. Since matters of money require accuracy and so on, choosing to use the utility services would be an ideal means that the business may be sure of accurate results when it comes to the monetary issues.15:53Here‚Äôs when charity shops will open - and the new safety measures in place for donations

‚ÄúMe time‚Äù almost always means looking after other people, focusing on workplace projects, or dealing with issues that aren‚Äôt related to our emotional, physical, and mental needs. In fact, we constantly tell ourselves that we don‚Äôt have enough time for self-care.
While we never seem to have a problem dropping everything to help a friend or family member in need, dropping everything for our own needs is much more difficult. We convince ourselves that self-care is somehow selfish or makes us look weak. But the truth is, we simply can‚Äôt be our best selves unless we dedicate some time to support our emotional, physical, and mental health. Without self-care, we become exhausted, overwhelmed, and unable to accomplish our goals.
So, here are 8 simple things we can all do to start taking better care of ourselves:
#1. Get Outside
Home can be an incredibly comforting place, but that doesn‚Äôt mean you should spend your entire life within the same four walls. Ditching the comfort of your couch for a couple of hours can be a powerful way to improve your physical and mental health. After all, regular physical activity gets your blood pumping, and fresh air supplies your brain with fresh oxygen.
Additionally, research suggests that being out in nature more often can make us happier. It‚Äôs hard to feel miserable when you‚Äôre surrounded by beautiful greenery and warm sunshine. Even a walk on a cold winter day can be enough to pick up your mood. If you struggle to find an excuse to get outside, try moving your indoor workout outdoors. Or take a neighbor‚Äôs dog for a walk. (Even better, rescue a dog from your local shelter for a never-ending reason to get outside!)
#2. Improve Your Work/Life Balance
These days, work/life balance is an important component of a successful self-care routine. When you‚Äôre constantly focusing on work projects and impending deadlines, it‚Äôs easy to forget that you need to take care of yourself too. If you struggle to switch off even when you‚Äôre away from the office, try setting aside specific time slots when you‚Äôre not allowed to check your email or think about your schedule.
A good way to make sure that you stick to these work-free moments is to make time with friends and family instead. It‚Äôs hard to race back to your computer throughout the day when you‚Äôre with your loved ones, and you‚Äôll find that maintaining your work/life balance is much easier.
#3. Use Mindfulness to Stress Less
We all know that stress is bad for our health, but do you know about secondhand stress? That‚Äôs right. Research suggests that stressed people can make others around them experience higher degrees of anxiety. Chances are, if you think you don‚Äôt have stress, you may be fooling yourself. The constant pressure of juggling work and family life makes stress a common part of most of our lives.
One way to reduce your stress‚Äîat least throughout certain periods of your day‚Äîis to engage in a little purposeful mindfulness. Focusing on the present can be a liberating way to relax your mind and minimize feelings of stress and depression.
#4. Drink a Cup of Broth or Herbal Tea
Most people don‚Äôt realize that a nice hot drink can actually work wonders for the mind and body. Herbal teas, bone broths, and tonics are a great way to sneak in a healthful brew.
A hot drink also helps you slow down, because you can‚Äôt simply drink it in one gulp. You must pause long enough to sip your way through it. During that time, you can slow your breathing, relax your mind, and allow your body and brain to regenerate and face the rest of the day.
#5. Boost Happiness with Meditation
Despite what most people think, daily meditation doesn‚Äôt mean you have to sit around and chant for an hour. In fact, you can spend as little as five to ten minutes on meditation to reap the benefits.
Just a few moments to quiet your mind can be enough to eliminate stress and help you deal with complex challenges. Many of us try to push ourselves through one issue after the next, without taking any time to simply relax and recuperate. Unfortunately, this ‚Äúall-go‚Äù approach to life quickly leads to feeling exhausted and overwhelmed. Take a few minutes every day to relax, close your eyes, and let your mind wander. When you‚Äôre done, crack a smile and start filling yourself full of positive energy.
#6. Notice Your Nutrition
Good nutrition is a critical component of maintaining a healthy body, mind, and spirit. After all, food is the fuel that keeps you going every day. Unfortunately, not all fuel sources are created equally. While it might be tempting to eat fast food when you‚Äôre rushing from one project to the next, it‚Äôs important to find time for good proteins and fats, fruits, vegetables, and mineral-packed foods like seaweed.
Planning your meals makes it much easier to get nutrient dense foods into your diet so you can improve your physical health. At the same time, planning also gives you checkpoints to work toward during your day as you‚Äôll need to schedule at least thirty minutes during lunch and dinner to make and eat your healthy meals.
#7. Find Some Quiet
Sometimes it can feel like life is screaming at you from all directions. Your kids are loud. Your job is loud. And when you‚Äôre dealing with the constant strain of stress, even your own mind is loud. It‚Äôs important let yourself enjoy the experience of quiet from time to time. As we live in an increasingly noisy world, silence can be one of the best ways to relax your mind and spirit.
Sitting quietly in a room or under a tree with nothing but your own thoughts is a great way to help rebalance yourself. It gives you a moment to think about your wants and needs rather than constantly respond to the demands of everything and everyone around you. You don‚Äôt need hours of quiet time to see the difference‚Äîjust twenty to thirty minutes a day can be enough to help you wind down and refocus.
#8. Add Relaxation to Your Schedule
While self-care isn‚Äôt always easy, it is essential. That‚Äôs why it‚Äôs so important to add a period of relaxation into your hectic schedule no matter how busy you are. You can use that R&R however you like. Go for a walk in the sun on a warm day. Treat yourself to a massage once a week. Find something that works for you and give yourself permission to do it.
Depending on what‚Äôs going on in your life, the amount of time you can devote to relaxation will go up and down. If you already have some time off work, you can really double down on your self-care. During those more hectic periods, you‚Äôll simply need to be patient with yourself and relax whenever you have the chance.

We are hopefully nearing the end of the Covid19 Pandemic.
My staff and I are back at work , usual hours.
We are very happy to see all patients but if you feel you may have symptoms of acute Covid 19, do telephone first to discuss how to take the appointment forwards.
Our local private hospitals and associated consultants are also more or less back and prepared to see private patients, the private hospitals were of course seconded to the NHS until the end of June.
I am happy to take urgent nose and throat swabs to test for the Covid 19 antigen if you require a negative swab for travel etc. We are also performing the Abbott antibody blood test for those who want to know whether they had Corona and have developed an antibody response.
I look forwards to seeing you. Peter Kapff 28/7/20the happy-go-lucky man, who wants to show after dinner at the family meeting, tries somersaults

are similar to those suffered after a second dose, according to a study published by the U.S.‚Äô main public health agency, and are occurring at roughly the same rate.
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said late Tuesday that data from about 12,600 people who have received a booster dose found the most common side effects remained injection site pain, fatigue and headache and most were reported the day after vaccination.
The data were gathered from Aug. 12 to Sept. 19 with 79.4% of those receiving the third dose reporting local reaction and 74.1% reporting systemic reactions. The data offers an overview of the safety of the booster, which is being offered to adults above the age of 65 years, to people with compromised immune systems and to healthcare and other front-line workers at risk of contracting the illness at work. CDC data shows that 3.4 million people have received a booster so far.

The U.S. is still averaging more than 2,000 COVID deaths a day, according to a New York Times tracker, although new cases and hospitalizations are declining especially in some of the states that were recent hot spots.
Florida, for example, is now averaging about 7,000 cases a day, down sharply from more than 20,000 cases a day in August. Florida is averaging 311 deaths a day, and has suffered a total of 54,063 fatalities since the start of the outbreak.
Most new cases, hospitalizations and deaths are in unvaccinated people and health experts continue to lament that so many people living in America are refusing to get their shots and putting themselves at risk of dying a preventable death.
The CDC‚Äôs vaccine tracker is showing that some 185 million Americans are fully vaccinated, equal to 55.8% of the population. That means they have had two doses of the Pfizer

About 214 million people have received one dose, equal to 64.4% of the overall population. The numbers have remained stubbornly static for weeks.
Vaccine mandates are helping in persuading some groups to get their shots, however. New York healthcare workers, for example, have mostly complied with the state‚Äôs vaccine mandate, a trend that has played out in other states too, according to the Times.
United Airlines is moving ahead with plans to terminate close to 600 employees who didn‚Äôt meet its COVID-19 vaccination deadline, according to the Wall Street Journal. The airline has 67,000 U.S. employees, so the 600 account for less than 1% of its workforce.

Elsewhere, Russia suffered yet another record daily death toll of 857, beating a record set a day earlier, Radio Free Europe reported. Russia‚Äôs total deaths from COVID-19 total more than 206,000 ‚Äî the highest total in Europe.
Russia is also embroiled in a dispute with YouTube after the Google unit blocked two German-language channels backed by the Russian government for spreading COVID misinformation, BBC News reported. Russian media watchdog Roskomnadzor accused Google-owned YouTube of censorship and warned it could lead to YouTube being banned in Russia.
YouTube is removing several video channels associated with leading antivaccine activists, including Robert F. Kennedy Jr., the Washington Post reported.
Don‚Äôt miss:Beyond the science, some experts say there‚Äôs an economic case for giving out COVID-19 booster shots
There was bad news from Scotland, which has suffered the most weekly COVID deaths since February, The Scotsman newspaper reported. Some 165 people in Scotland died of the illness from Sept. 20 to 26.
Harvard Business School has moved most of its M.B.A. classes online following a spate of COVID-19 infections among its students, according to the Wall Street Journal. The move to remote instruction for all first-year courses and some second-year courses will run until at least Oct. 3, the school said, and comes about a month after the start of classes.
Read now: Scientists continue to say there isn‚Äôt enough evidence to make COVID-19 boosters available to all Americans
A U.K. study conducted by Oxford University has found that more than a third of COVID patients continue to suffer from at least one long-term symptom three to six months after infection, Reuters reported. The study involved 270,000 people recovering from COVID-19. and found the most common symptoms were breathing problems, fatigue, pain and anxiety.

Get to know me better
passionate and perfection in every dish
Patricia Benavides, sushi chef , I was born in a small village of Leon in Spain.
It may sound weird that a Spanish woman makes sushi, but yes, it is me.
I was in a kitchen school for two years, touching service as well, but more the kitchen.
My first work experience as an assistant kitchen(practices) was in 2005 at Restaurant El Ermita√±o(Michelin Star),after that I jumped to Balearic Islands, first Palma de Mallorca, then Menorca and finally I arrived to Ibiza.In Mallorca and Menorca I was working in hotels, easy job in cold sections and buffet .
Was in Ibiza where I started to touch the Japanese food.
My first steps with sushi were in Pacha Ibiza Restaurant and my master was and still is the great sushi master Jotta Cunha, he was one of the first chefs who introduced the sushi on the island in 1999.
I was working with him 6-7 summer season and any winter as well‚Ä¶.
He taught me everything about Japanese food, from tempuras till how to touch and clean the fish.
I always remember with a big smile on my face the first plates that I sent from the kitchen, he never liked, was a disasters and I had it to repeat many times the same plate till he liked.
One of the winters that I stayed in Ibiza I got a really interesting offer from the Spanish chef Senen Gonzalez,i went with him to Madrid Fusion for make the presentation of his crazy and interesting project called,Mediterranean sushi, made with vegetable sheets that replace the nori seaweed with mediterranean products.
I was with him in his restaurant called Sagartoki in Vitoria (Basque Country) 3 months making videos and pictures for his web page about how to make sushi with the vegetable sheets.Was a really funny time and I was learning a lot of him.Always grateful to have been lucky enough to be able to work with him.
In 2012 after summer season I went to London for work in Novikov Restaurant but with a Big dream called Nobu.
In Novikov I had it one of the worst experiences in my career as a chef, I didn‚Äôt speak almost English and the head chef hates me, but thanks to work there,2 years later I got an offer as sushi chef in Zurich, but I will talk later about that.
During my 3 months working in Novikov I was sending cv to Nobu, trying to get a trial, and YES!!I got it!!
Nobu experience was the oposite than Novikov,
There I met really interesting chefs and I was learning a lot, but my London experience didn‚Äôt last long and I made my way back home (Ibiza) for work as sushi chef in different places like Destino, Lio,Ibiza Gran Hotel,Km5 and also as freelance chef in villas and boats.
During my last summer in the island I got the offer for work in Zurich as sushi chef in a restaurant called Alice Choo, actually is close and dosent exist any more, but was a very nice year with amazing people and beautiful memories.
After that experience I was jumping in few restaurant in Zurich city, Hato was one of them, till I arrive to Clash Restaurant ,my last place, was short but intense,,,many thanks to all the people that I met there, big love and respect for all of them.
Actually im focus on my own business , private parties, dinners, events‚Ä¶everywhere if you would like to introduce sushi, just write me a mail or give me a call and we can talk about the offers.
Thats a part of my biography and way as chef till now,,,I keep learning everyday

For me, cooking is...
A big passion and a lifestyle
I learned to cook at...
Gastronomie school and after that I always learned something in every different place I was working
A role model in the kitchen is...

If there‚Äôs ANY chance you could be having a heart attack, you want to make a beeline for the emergency room ‚Äî STAT!
And once you‚Äôre there, I‚Äôm sure you‚Äôll do anything to find out what‚Äôs going on inside your heart.
But according to a new study, the CT scans that docs say will diagnose a heart attack are not just unnecessary‚Ä¶ but they could also zap you with a toxic dose of radiation.
In the study, published in JAMA Internal Medicine, 1,000 patients who showed up in the ER with chest pain at nine different hospitals were randomly assigned to one of two protocols.
They received either a standard clinical evaluation ‚Äî including a physical exam, EKG, and blood test for troponin, a protein that‚Äôs released when your heart suffers damage ‚Äî OR the same evaluation plus either a treadmill stress test or a CT scan.
Now, it should come as no surprise that patients who got the extra tests spent about eight hours longer in the hospital ‚Äî and racked up about $500 more in medical bills ‚Äî than those who got only the standard evaluation.
But the real kicker was that the extra stuff turned out to be time and money WASTED.
You see, those CT scans and treadmill trips didn‚Äôt make diagnosing a heart attack any more accurate than the old bedside exam and blood test.
And those who received the extra tests fared no better than those given the standard evaluation during their follow-up exams a month later.
There was NO difference between the two groups in terms of who later returned to the ER‚Ä¶ who went on to suffer a major cardiac event‚Ä¶ or who needed bypass surgery.
But one thing did set the CT scan group apart from the rest: They were exposed to a boatload of radiation.
That‚Äôs because CT scans can deliver dozens of times more radiation than a simple X-ray ‚Äî and studies have shown that it can ‚Äúcook‚Äù your cells and damage their delicate DNA.
That means you could walk INTO the emergency room with chest pain‚Ä¶ and walk OUT with a higher risk of cancer!
Instead, the gold standard for diagnosing a heart attack is the presence of troponin ‚Äî and the latest troponin blood tests are so sensitive that they may be all that‚Äôs necessary.
But even a thorough bedside examination by a skilled physician will often reveal everything you need to know ‚Äî without radiation.Articles
>. Glycogen loading (super compensation) or commonly called carbohydrate loading has been proven to enhance athletic performance. Endurance athletes benefit from glycogen loading to delay fatigue in events lasting one hour or longer. The ability to sustain prolonged exercise depends on muscle glycogen concentration.
Additionally, bodybuilders benefit from glycogen loading since each gram of glycogen is stored in muscle with approximately 3 grams of water resulting in an increase in muscle size and definition. Glycogen may be the most important fuel source for energy during exercise. There is a direct correlation between the glycogen stored in muscles and liver and the ingestion of carbohydrates. The enzyme responsible for the synthesis of glycogen is glycogen synthase.
The American College of Sports Medicine recommends that carbohydrate be ingested at a rate of 30 to 60 grams per hour to maintain oxidation of carbohydrates as fuel and delay fatigue.
Max ACM contains the Triple Carb Matrix and is highly multi-functional. The waxy maize starch (amylopectin) is a high molecular weight carbohydrate found to support glycogen loading. This dense and highly branched carbohydrate has an approximate molecular weight greater than 500,000 and approximately 100 times greater molecular weight than maltodextrin and 3000 times greater molecular weight than dextrose. The waxy maize starch molecule is absorbed far quicker as it passes through the stomach faster than dextrose or maltodextrin. The maltodextrin (glucose polymer) fraction of the Triple Carb Matrix is an easily digested short chain of 3 ‚Äî 20 dextrose (glucose) units in length and a convenient source of intermediate energy to support high levels of energy during intensity or endurance exercise. Maltodextrin has been shown to be an ideal carbohydrate for energy replacement drinks. Lastly, the Triple Carb Matrix contains the cutting edge carbohydrate called trehalose. Trehalose is a naturally occurring disaccharide containing 2 glucose units in an alpha, alpha 1,1 linkage. Trehalose is a significantly smaller molecule than the waxy maize starch or maltodextrin with a more extended digesting and absorption time. An addition benefit of trehalose is its ability to aid in nutrient absorption.
Each serving of Max ACM provides 40 grams of rapidly assimilated high molecular weight carbohydrates (waxy maize starch), intermediate molecular weight maltodextrin along with the low molecular weight trehalose providing the ideal amounts and forms of carbohydrates to maximize glycogen synthesis, and endurance activity, intense training sessions, bodybuilding, etc.
If you are a serious athlete who trains at a high intensity, Max ACM will provide you with three pure source carbohydrates that will allow you to train harder and longer before fatigue sets in. Max ACM is ideal for pre-loading, during exercise and post-loading strategies.
CARBOHYDRATE LOADING PLANS
Pre-workout: Mix one serving (40 gm) of Max ACM with 16 to 20 ounces of pure cold water. Shake well for at least 20 seconds. Drink 30 minutes before your workout or as tolerated. May be mixed with your favorite protein, BCAA or pre-workout blend.
Post-workout: Max ACM is ideal for post-workout glycogen replenishing and halt catabolism.
Mix one serving (40 gm) of Max ACM with 16 to 20 ounces of pure cold water. Shake well for at least 20 seconds. Consume immediately after your workout. May also be mixed with your favorite whey protein, BCAA or pre-workout blend.
Weight Gain: For a delicious and nutritious high calorie drink, mix Max ACM with one or more of these; fruit, yogurt, milk, eggs, or juice. It is possible to ingest over 1,000 calories per drink when you combine additional food sources as mentioned. Try this 3-4 times a day; you should see results very quickly.
Max ACM is unflavored and extremely versatile. Max ACM complements with other MMSN protein powders to increase the total caloric value, creatine, glutamine, BCAAs and other strength and recovery supplements.

‚ÄòThe Voice‚Äô Star RaeLynn Feels ‚ÄòBlessed‚Äô By Relationship With Coach Adam Levine
Country singer RaeLynn (real name Racheal Lynn Woodward) feels ‚Äúgenuinely so blessed‚Äù by her experience on The Voice and her relationship with former coach Adam Levine, she exclusively dished to Life & Style. ‚ÄúI love that The Voice family really does stay together, and they do stay connected,‚Äù she added.
The ‚ÄúBra Off‚Äù artist competed on season 2 of the reality show when she was just 17 and made it to the quarterfinals before getting eliminated. Although she was on Blake Shelton‚Äôs team, she‚Äôs received love and support from all the stars who sat in the iconic swivel chairs.
The ‚ÄúGod Made Girls‚Äù artist, 25, recalled a recent time she received support from the Maroon 5 singer, 41, after sharing a video of herself singing ‚ÄúPayphone‚Äù on Instagram. ‚ÄúI totally forgot that Adam still follows me on Instagram after The Voice ‚Ä¶ He messaged me and was like, ‚ÄòI love following you. I hope you and your husband are well. You‚Äôre such a ray of light. And, I hope, you know, you‚Äôre getting through these crazy times,‚Äô‚Äù the RaeLynn explained ahead of her performance during Crown Royal‚Äôs #GenerosityHour on April 24 where the whiskey brand donated $400,000 to continue helping the USBG Bartender Emergency Assistance Fund. ‚ÄúEven though we don‚Äôt talk all the time, [the coaches] know what‚Äôs going on with all of us, and I just thought that was really cool of [Adam].‚Äù
The ‚ÄúKeep Up‚Äù artist is exploding with new hits and even revealed she‚Äôs written ‚Äúsix or seven songs‚Äù while quarantining amid the coronavirus pandemic. However, she credits the singing competition show for helping her find her ‚Äúconfidence‚Äù when she was getting started. ‚ÄúBefore The Voice, I didn‚Äôt know that I had a different voice. The instrument that I had was different. So, when I was on the show, everybody on the show told me, ‚ÄòNo, your voice is unique,‚Äô‚Äù the songstress said. ‚ÄúWhen you only hear yourself sing, you don‚Äôt know that it can be unique ‚Ä¶ I know the biggest thing that I took away from that show [was] hearing from amazing people in the industry that I had a voice that should be heard, and I had a voice that was unique enough to cut through.‚Äù
Nearly 10 years later, RaeLynn is still sparkling on the country music charts. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs helped me make it this far and keep trekking along because when you hear me, I don‚Äôt sound like anybody else,‚Äù she added. ‚ÄúBut, I didn‚Äôt know that before that show.‚Äù
We can‚Äôt wait to see what‚Äôs next for her!Melanie Ross Levin lives in Washington, D.C., with her 2-year-old daughter, Elliana, and husband, Seth. An advocate for women‚Äôs rights and equality, she currently serves as Senior Outreach Manager at the National Women‚Äôs Law Center, where she focuses on education, employment, and family economic security issues.
Dear Elliana,
By 6th grade I was the tallest girl in the school, and by 8th grade the third tallest person, including the boys. At 5 foot 9 inches, I was one lanky middle-schooler. And while that may seem cool to a two-year-old, it was uncool in middle school. I was trying to fit in, make friends and just be like everyone else.
Then sports came to my rescue. My long frame became an asset, and I learned to embrace who I was. I could shoot a basketball over the heads of snotty boys, run faster than the preppy girls and turn teammates into lifelong friends. Sports injected me with something I needed: self-confidence.
In high school, just about everyone, especially the boys, caught up to my height, lessening my natural advantage. So I just kept practicing and improving. But I realized sports was no longer just about me. I committed to being part of the field hockey team for four years. Eventually I became co-captain. That enabled me to learn leadership:
Winning was fun, of course, but as it turned out, losing taught me perseverance. I accepted defeat with dignity and immediately refocused for the next game. I developed resilience and, with it, some measure of character.
Now I have a confession to make. I want you to get all the benefits from sports that I received growing up. Now, as your mama, I know I‚Äôm supposed to expose you to a lot of activities and let you choose your passion. Or at least that‚Äôs what the books and blogs tell me to do. But I really hope you end up loving sports.
Why? Well, to be selfish for a moment, I want to go to games and cheer you on from the sidelines and be ‚Äúthat parent‚Äù ‚Äì the one with the orange slices who volunteers to coach. I want to take a ton of pictures, just as I already do, and celebrate your successes and comfort you when you lose. Plus, I‚Äôm unable to resist a bunch of little kids swarming around a soccer ball ‚Äì it‚Äôs too cute.
But the biggest reason I want you to play sports is this: Maybe sports will benefit you as sports benefitted me. Maybe you, too, will come away self-confident, resilient, your character strengthened, a leader.
Fortunately, you‚Äôll have lots of opportunities to experience sports in and out of school ‚Äì in large part due to pioneering women‚Äôs sports figures who championed Title IX. Before, Title IX schools could discriminate against women in a number of ways, including on the playing field. That‚Äôs just wrong, and your mama is going to fight to continue to keep the law strong.
Maybe tonight you and I should take out a ball and practice some kicking and throwing. It‚Äôs never too soon to take that first step.We have updated our Privacy Policy. Please click here to review the updates. Accept

Traditionally known for helping those with physical disabilities gain access to assistive technologies, AgrAbility continues to evolve to meet the needs of underserved populations, including but not limited to veterans and caregivers.
‚ÄúWithout Voc-Rehab (Indiana Vocational Rehabilitation Services) and AgrAbility, I wouldn‚Äôt be able to do it,‚Äù said Mark Hosier, an AgrAbility client. ‚ÄúI thought if I couldn‚Äôt walk and do it by myself, it wasn‚Äôt going to happen. They‚Äôve given me my life back.‚Äù
During October, AgrAbility projects from 20 states will participate in the AgrAbility Virtual State Fair on Facebook and Twitter. Each day, a SRAP organizer will highlight how it supports and serves within the state‚Äôs agriculture employment landscape. Educational programs and assistive information will also be shared each weekend for veterans in agriculture, assistive technology, caregivers, youth and underserved populations, including Black, Latino and Native American direct support.
‚ÄúWe are excited for this year‚Äôs AgrAbility Virtual State Fair to share nationwide agriculture resources and success stories with those with a disability already working or interested in agriculture. The AgrAbility program has changed and continues to change as we add new educational resources and support for the challenges farmers face today,‚Äù said Paul Jones, project manager of NAP.
‚ÄúImproving and enhancing the quality of life for our farmers, ranchers and agricultural workers to help them continue to enjoy agricultural work is incredibly important to NIFA,‚Äù said NIFA director Carrie Castille. ‚ÄúWe are proud to support the tremendous work of the AgrAbility program and its 30-year legacy of fulfilling this important mission.‚Äù
Connect with AgrAbility on social media to learn the latest about assistive technologies, resources, safety tips, information, and more.

First authorized in the 1990 Farm Bill (with funding appropriations beginning in 1991), AgrAbility is a grant-funded program through the United States Department of Agriculture‚Äôs National Institute of Food and Agriculture (USDA-NIFA). Each project must involve a collaboration between a land-grant university and at least one non-profit disability services organization.

Vice-Chancellor Professor Geraldine Mackenzie said the measures would help the University‚Äôs most vulnerable navigate difficult situations.
‚ÄúWe pride ourselves on the individual support we offer our students, and we‚Äôve worked very hard behind the scenes to make the transition to online learning as smooth as possible in the past few weeks,‚Äù Professor Mackenzie said.
‚ÄúWe know how important it is for our students to receive the support they need and feel empowered to continue with their studies in this rapidly changing environment.‚Äù
Pro Vice-Chancellor (Students) Professor Josh Pienaar said the University was aware that this was still a uniquely stressful and anxious time for students faced with a loss of income, poor internet connectivity or no personal computer.
‚ÄúSo now we‚Äôre also offering additional financial support to assist with living expenses, and access to technology and learning resources like textbooks and software,‚Äù he said.
- The support plan will include:Living expenses (one-off and/or fortnightly payments of $500 for up to three months)
- Provision of technology (one-off payments of $1000)
- Provision of learning resources (one-off payments of $500)
‚ÄúAs a leader in high quality online education in Australia, USQ was ready and able to move quickly with most degree programs already available fully online,‚Äù Professor Pienaar said.
‚ÄúBut in recognition of the considerable upheaval caused by COVID-19, we‚Äôre also offering some extra academic support measures.‚Äù
These include:
- Assessment considerations (such as assignment extensions)
- Fail marks not affecting GPA
- Extended hours and extra online chat, academic and learning support
‚ÄúSteps are also being taken to support our Residential Colleges, including regular welfare checks and financial assistance.‚Äù
Professor Pienaar said COVID-19 had brought with it changes to the way students worked, and had impacted their family life, employment, and education.
‚ÄúThrough these times, we must all remember that the current difficult situation will pass, and with this in mind I encourage students to remain focused on their longer term education and career goals,‚Äù he said.
‚ÄúWe will make it through this together.‚Äù
USQ employees are also stepping up with the upcoming launch of a staff-giving program to assist the student community.Related Midwest, Magellan Development, Sterling Bay, Clayco, The Chicago Federation Of Labor, And The Chicagoland Association Of General Contractors Announce First-Of-Its-Kind Loan Fund For Chicago‚Äôs Minority Small Business OwnersAugust 30, 2019

REV'IT Poseidon 2 GTX Jacket Silver/Anthracite description
The new Rev‚Äôit! Poseidon 2 GTX jacket is an extremely strong motorcycle jacket, designed for use in the most extreme circumstances. Wearing this jacket you will feel like you‚Äôre in a tank. The outer layer is a combination of fabrics and materials which work together to create an optimally protective shell. The 2L & 3L nylon 400D GORE-TEX¬Æ fabrics are made of robust 400 denier nylon, which offers superior resistance against tearing. The GORE-TEX¬Æ membrane has been laminated against the nylon outer shell, which results in a 100% waterproof, windproof and well breathing fabric.
The thermal-lining is removable, meaning you can wear this versatile jacket in multiple seasons. One of the handiest features of this jacket is the VCS | aquadefence system with FidLock¬Æ magnetic closure, which allows you to let a pleasant airflow gush through your jacket ‚Äì keeping you cool on warmer days. Protection-wise this jacket is equipped with SEEFLEX CE level 2 protectors, and it is even possible to upgrade the jacket by adding the SEESOFT CE level 2 back protector and Divided Chest protectors. The CE level 2 protectors offer the best possible protection during a dynamic impact. The renewed SuperFabric¬Æ, which has been worked into the jacket, is 5 times more wear-resistant than leather ‚Äì but to keep it comfortable, it weighs half as much. So if you‚Äôre looking for a serious jacket that will last you for years to come, then the Poseidon 2 GTX jacket is definitely a fantastic choice.

Gabe Kapler often paints the most optimistic picture when sizing up a potentially difficult situation for his club, but when second baseman Donovan Solano left Wednesday‚Äôs game in Philadelphia with a calf strain, the Giants manager delivered a sobering analysis.
‚ÄúOne of the reasons it‚Äôs tough to lose Solano is because no matter how you slice it, it‚Äôs going to lighten our bench a little bit,‚Äù Kapler said. ‚ÄúAnd that‚Äôs one of the the major strengths of our team.‚Äù
Solano will likely be placed on the 10-day injured list ahead of Thursday‚Äôs series opener against the Miami Marlins, leaving the Giants without one of their best and most consistent hitters. The injury will have a ripple effect because Solano, who splits time at second base with Tommy La Stella, is often the best available option for Kapler off the bench and has been used throughout the month of April as a defensive replacement in the late innings.
Kapler pointed out that Solano‚Äôs injury will create an opportunity for another Giants player to step up, but it‚Äôs not immediately clear how the club will divide up the at-bats that Solano would have taken.
Giants executives Farhan Zaidi and Scott Harris have several decisions to weigh in determining who to promote to the active roster to take Solano‚Äôs place on Thursday.
The front office could replace Solano with another infielder, Thairo Estrada, who was recently acquired off waivers from the New York Yankees. Estrada has experience at both shortstop and second base and bats from the right side, so of the 40-man roster players available, he profiles most similarly to Solano.
The Giants could also move utility man Mauricio Dub√≥n into the infield on a near-full-time basis and promote an outfielder such as Steven Duggar, who can take the late-inning reps in center field that Dub√≥n has been earning as a defensive upgrade off the bench. Adding Duggar would give the Giants another left-handed bat and would allow Kapler to pair Dub√≥n at second base with Brandon Crawford at shortstop, which might be the best defensive duo the club can use in the middle of the diamond in Solano‚Äôs absence.
Any lineup that includes both Duggar and Dub√≥n would clearly prioritize defense, as neither have been much of a threat at the plate in their most recent opportunities.
After back-to-back four-inning outings from their starting pitchers, the Giants may also elect to go with a short bench on Thursday and add a reliever such as Sam Selman to the 26-man roster. Kapler stretched the bullpen out in Philadelphia and the Giants were attempting to secure a series sweep on Wednesday while giving days off to their most reliable back-end arms, Tyler Rogers and Jake McGee.
Temporarily bringing Selman or another reliever into the mix could ease the load for a Giants team that doesn‚Äôt have another off day until Thursday, April 29, but it would place further limitations on Kapler‚Äôs ability to seek favorable late-game matchups off the bench.
With Dub√≥n, La Stella and Wilmer Flores on the 26-man roster, the Giants have no shortage of options at second base, but they‚Äôll clearly miss having the reigning National League Silver Slugger Award at the position in the lineup or available off the bench.
Giants players have joked that Kapler has both a right-handed lineup and a left-handed lineup and even if the Giants add Estrada from the alternate site and keep the rest of the roster as is, the club will be lacking some firepower and Solano‚Äôs valuable contact skills.
No bench in the majors has been more active than Kapler‚Äôs this season as the Giants have already clubbed five pinch-hit home runs, which lead the big leagues. With Solano out, the Giants‚Äô bench will be weakened as fans will likely see one or two fewer platoons in the starting lineup and hitters with lesser track records available late in games.Welcome to the team Strong Bloodstock.

Last year, due to the pandemic, the medal ceremony did not take place. For that reason, the 2020 medalists received their medals on August 25, 2021. The 2021 medalists will receive their medals on November 5, 2021. The Prince Eugene Medal was instituted by Gustav V to mark the 80th birthday of Prince Eugene in 1945.
Lovely colour and style in Silvia's outfit, but the jacket is too small and the sleeves do not have the right fit on shoulders. - Ellie
Quelle magnifique silhouette dans ce tailleur-jupe au boutonnage original ; tr√®s jolie couleur !
What a lovely colour for Silvia - but the star is the Lady in red!
Always elegant. This soft color suits her wonderfully. Lovely Queen Silvia. King Carl-Gustav looks handsome. They make a great team.
This is another nice, classy look for the swedisch Queen, but the fit could be better, over the chest and shoulder area, also I'm not a real fan of an angled button front . (I have jacket like that myself, but zippered).
The colour lovely.
Another nice suit in a great colour, though the jacket is not a particularly good fit. Is the red outfit a traditional Swedish outfit?
It is a traditional outfit from far up North. Beautiful.
The Queen looks elegant. Mary I
Not a fan of the angled cut of the jacket, but the color and style fits her nicely. Both the King and Queen look relaxed and engaged with the participants. jj
Strange that from this lovely coloured suit the jacket is so I‚Äôll fitting.
Love the idea of the buttons, but it needs something to keep the tissue in place.

In his speech, Xi put forward five points to urge the international community to work together to practice true multilateralism, which analysts said showcased China's efforts to build a community of shared future against the backdrop of the US' creating small cliques in violation of multilateralism. China and the majority of developing countries would play a bigger role in defending the UN's central mandate and the international order., President Xi said, according to the English text the Chinese Foreign Ministry released on its website.
The restoration of New China's lawful seat in the United Nations was a momentous event for the world and the United Nations. It came as the result of joint efforts of all peace-loving countries that stood up for justice in the world, said Xi.
Xi recalled China's contributions and cooperation with the UN in the past 50 years. China has always worked with people of the world in defending world peace and justice, and the Chinese people have always defended the UN's authority and status, and practiced multilateralism to deepen cooperation with the UN.
The 50th anniversary of the restoration of the PRC's lawful seat in the UN is a milestone in the history of China and the international community since the UN finally included the biggest developing country, analysts said.
Leaders of many international organizations and diplomats also sent their congratulations to China on the 50th anniversary.
On Monday, Xi also met with UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres via video link. Guterres congratulated China on the 50th anniversary of the restoration of PRC's lawful seat in the UN. Both sides expressed willingness to deepen cooperation on a wide range of issues, including vaccine distribution, poverty alleviation, coping with climate change and the protection of biodiversity.
Amina J. Mohammed, deputy secretary-general of the UN, also congratulated China and praised China's steadfast support to the UN in a video message released on Monday.
Siddharth Chatterjee, UN resident coordinator in China, told the Global Times on Monday that what President Xi said was inspiring on all counts, as he reaffirmed the importance of the UN and the centrality of multilateralism.
As the UN Resident Coordinator, I can confirm that China's achievements provide valuable lessons in poverty alleviation that we will continue to share with other developing countries through South-South cooperation, Chatterjee said.
Russian Ambassador to China Andrey Denisov told the Global Times that it was indeed a historic moment 50 years ago. Since then, the PRC, as a responsible member of the international community, has contributed greatly to world peace and development.
China stands firm in upholding the purposes and principles of the UN Charter and preserving the authority and the central role of the UN. It always declares its readiness to work with other parties to fulfill its due responsibilities as a major country to uphold global peace and justice, the Russian ambassador said.
Iranian Ambassador to China Mohammad Keshavarzzadeh told the Global Times that in the last 50 years, China has rendered a special model of development and changed into an influential great power position, and in the past half century, China played a major role in opposing unilateralism and defending multilateralism.
Cuban Ambassador to China Carlos Miguel Pereira told the Global Times that China has become a vital player in the UN system. China has given a firm voice in the UN against foreign interference in the internal affairs of other countries, and a firm stand against hostile unilateralist acts by the US and other major powers against progressive countries.
For the past half century, China has conducted fruitful cooperation with the UN in every field, which benefited both sides, and these have created a spillover effect on the majority of developing countries - encouraging their own security stability and economic development, Sheng Hongsheng, a professor at the Shanghai University of Political Science and Law and a former UN Military Observer in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, told the Global Times on Monday.
Sheng noted that China's insistence on fairness and justice has also influenced the UN process on certain issues and helped promote its role in defending world peace and development.
The restoration of PRC's lawful seat 50 years ago is one of the key diplomatic achievements the PRC made under the leadership of the Communist Party of China (CPC). Since then, China's cooperation with the UN, and with other countries via UN platforms, is clear to all. The restoration had offered a window for socialist China to observe the world and also for the world to observe China, analysts said.
Five 'working together'
In his speech, Xi put forward five factors that the international community could work together on, including promoting the building of a community with a shared future for mankind, and working together to build an open, inclusive, clean and beautiful world that enjoys lasting peace, universal security and common prosperity and resolutely upholding the authority and standing of the UN, and working together to practice true multilateralism.
Xi pointed out the five working together that echoed the previous five principles of peaceful coexistence promoted by China, Myanmar and India in the 1950s, and its purpose is to build a community of shared future. Since the end of World War II, one of the biggest trends in the international community is increasing interdependence between countries, and the five working together could be interpreted as China's guide to deal with international relations, Sheng said.
Zhang Guihong, director of the Center for the United Nations and International Organizations of the Institute of International Studies at Fudan University in Shanghai, said Xi's proposals put common values of humanity first - a concept that has been less discussed.
As a major developing country, China is different on values with many Western developed countries. Differences in ideologies and political systems are also manifested as differences in values. But the UN should be a platform where countries cast aside differences and try to consolidate common values and build a durable and firm community of shared future for mankind, Zhang said.
Given China's role in the world economy, the common goal to promote economic and social development is easy to understand. Dealing with climate change and the COVID-19 pandemic showed the urgent need to work together to address the various challenges and global issues facing humanity, said Zhang.
Xi also attached great importance to defending the UN's central role in dealing with international affairs.
We should resolutely uphold the authority and standing of the United Nations, and work together to practice true multilateralism, Xi said, noting that international rules can only be made by the 193 UN member states together, and not decided by individual countries or blocs of countries. International rules should be observed by the 193 UN member states, and there is and should be no exception, said Xi.
Sheng noted that in recent years, some countries repeatedly imposed unilateral sanctions on other countries regardless of the UN, which severely violated the purposes and principles of the UN Chapter, and damaged the UN's authority.
The UN is the core of the modern international system and the UN Charter is the cornerstone of the post-war international relations and order, and their authority cannot be impaired, Sheng said, noting that some countries created small cliques and excluded other countries on topics of shared interests, which also pose severe challenges to multilateralism.
In a recent move, the US-built AUKUS, a new military bloc with the UK and Australia, heightened geopolitical tensions and triggered outrage among countries in Asia and Europe, including China. Many have criticized the US for escalating an arms race and bringing instability.
Due to the tensions between the two biggest economies of the world and the declining influence of the US in the UN, China might need to play a bigger role and take on greater responsibility. China should take these steps to minimize the impact that the US brings to the UN since the US is now keen on forming small cliques to downplay the importance of the UN, or even try to replace it, experts noted.
Hua Liming, a former Chinese ambassador to Iran, UAE and the Netherlands, told the Global Times that multilateralism is most effective in containing hegemony and the US has found it cannot use the UN to legitimize and endorse its wrongdoings anymore. Therefore, the US prefers to execute its ambitions through small cliques rather than discussing matters in the UN.
China and the international community cannot stop the US from downplaying the importance of the UN, but they can work together to balance the negative impact from the US, Hua said.
Andrey Kortunov, director general of the Russian International Affairs Council, told the Global Times that since the early 2000s, China has played a more active role in setting the UN agenda in matters such as sustainable development, social and economic rights, and global inequality.
The China-Russia coordination within the UN Security Council helps both countries avoid possible isolation and build stronger coalitions of like-minded members in the Security Council, Kortunov said.
The UNSC resolution drafts co-sponsored by Beijing and Moscow have more weight than drafts predated by only one of the two countries. This coordination allows China and Russia to prevent the UNSC from becoming an instrument of the US and its allies, Kortunov noted.
ÈòÖËØªÂéüÊñáBy Olivia Popp
This is the seventh piece in the Sundance Film Festival 2021 series by Julie Fukunaga and Olivia Popp. Follow along for coverage of films from Sundance‚Äôs reimagined virtual festival.
After screening on the first day of the festival, Jonas Poher Rasmussen‚Äôs animated feature ‚ÄúFlee‚Äù became the first acquisition of Sundance 2021 when it was picked up by Neon for U.S. distribution, joining the ranks of Neon‚Äôs major U.S. acquisitions including ‚ÄúParasite,‚Äù ‚ÄúPortrait of a Lady on Fire‚Äù and ‚ÄúPalm Springs.‚Äù Rasmussen‚Äôs remarkably moving film about his close friend Amin Nawabi (a pseudonym), a gay Afghan refugee, premiered in the World Cinema Documentary section and won the section‚Äôs Grand Jury Prize. (The film was selected for the 2020 Cannes Film Festival but made its world premiere at Sundance after Cannes was canceled.)
‚ÄúFlee‚Äù demonstrates that animated features provide flexibility in telling powerful documentary stories. Blending archival footage with a self-referential animation style and topped off by a fantastic era-specific soundtrack (including iconic hits by Roxette, Ace of Base and a-ha) that will whisk you back to the late 1980s, ‚ÄúFlee‚Äù is an obvious must-watch when released widely.
Co-written by Rasmussen and Nawabi (this piece uses ‚ÄúAmin‚Äù to refer to the in-film character and ‚ÄúNawabi‚Äù to refer to the real-life person), ‚ÄúFlee‚Äù is a story told equally by the both of them. The two crafted the film together while Rasmussen interviewed Nawabi, who finally told his story of seeking asylum in Denmark after fleeing Afghanistan and following a circuitous route to his future home. Much of the animation in ‚ÄúFlee‚Äù is drawn from videos of Rasmussen‚Äôs live-action interviews with Nawabi. (In animated sequences that depict Rasmussen interviewing Amin, the former literally places himself into the film, albeit with blond hair instead of his real-life brown.) With Nawabi‚Äôs crucial part in the creative process, ‚ÄúFlee‚Äù thus acts as a documentary film while concurrently depicting the unfolding of Amin‚Äôs mind onscreen. It is a work that combats the commonly extractive or exploitative motivations behind documentary pieces that tell stories of trauma or deeply personal history.
Viewers are initially greeted with what we may take as Amin‚Äôs story, but we soon learn that this is the fabricated backstory he was implored to repeatedly tell and retell, a copy of which he wrote in his diary upon arriving in Denmark as a teen. As the unreliable narrative threads unravel, Amin‚Äôs ‚Äúreal past‚Äù is revealed, creating an emotional portrait of a young man simultaneously confronting his sexuality while enduring life in multiple places as a refugee. ‚ÄúFlee‚Äù is just as much about Amin‚Äôs story as it is about the story of him finally coming to terms with telling it.
As heartrending as ‚ÄúFlee‚Äù is at times, the film also exists comfortably in the present tense, as viewers are exposed to Amin‚Äôs current life as a successful academic preparing to move into a beautiful new home with his boyfriend and soon-to-be husband. Nonetheless, ‚ÄúFlee‚Äù doesn‚Äôt seek to be demonstrative or savioristic by linking some past trauma to a success story of exceptionalism. In particular, Amin‚Äôs queerness is handled with grace as one facet of his identity that viewers are allowed to see. Opening on a young Amin merrily dancing his way through the streets of Kabul wearing his sister‚Äôs dress while listening to a-ha‚Äôs ‚ÄúTake on Me,‚Äù the film illustrates how Amin grew aware of his sexuality from a young age, crushing first on martial arts action star Jean-Claude Van Damme ‚Äî whose film posters he hung in his bedroom. In Denmark, Amin has the opportunity to more openly adhere to his true self, but his queerness also casts each of his experiences ‚Äî such as the furtive crush that Amin has on a fellow refugee being smuggled out of Russia ‚Äî in a unique light. The only evidence of their encounter is a necklace that the young man gave Amin after catching him eyeing it. But set to pulsing 1990s rock hits, even their brief time together becomes one of heartwarming platonic intimacy and solidarity, rather than one of tragedy and missed connections.
The film‚Äôs collaborative element elevates the film beyond that of a simple retelling of a refugee narrative ‚Äî or even an animated documentary, for that matter. The effort it takes for Amin to piece apart fact from fiction is crucial to the compelling nature of ‚ÄúFlee.‚Äù The lasting impact of the multiple layers of truth reverberates through Amin‚Äôs life, as when he is blackmailed by an ex-boyfriend who discovered that the story he told to Danish authorities upon arriving in-country was untrue. At one point in the film, Amin also admits that perhaps his compulsion to pursue higher degrees was born out of a self-induced pressure to do as much as he could with the life for which his family dearly sacrificed themselves to give him. Viewers will likely be left with the hope that finally releasing his story by creating the film was a rewarding and perhaps even cathartic experience for Nawabi. Ultimately, ‚ÄúFlee‚Äù beautifully brings into question what we may take as documentary filmmaking ‚Äî especially considering the constructed and highly conditional natures of objectivity, truth and authenticity.Here you can find an updated list of the latest Winchester Savings Bank promotions, bonuses, and offers.

12:05 minutes
12:05 minutes
From 1976 to 2017, the Democratic Republic of the Congo experienced eight outbreaks of the deadly Ebola virus. Then,.
[After a bridge suddenly collapsed in Italy, politicians and safety officials have been raising questions about engineering safety.].
In a recent paper published in the journal Science, Nuno Faria of the University of Oxford describes how his team used real time genome sequencing of the Yellow Fever virus to track where it came from and which groups might be at risk. He joins Ira to discuss the work.
Anthony Fauci is director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases at the The National Institutes of Health in Bethesda, Maryland.
Nuno Faria is Royal Society Research Fellow at the University of Oxford in Oxford, United Kingdom.
IRA FLATOW: This is Science Friday. I‚Äôm Ira Flatow. The Democratic Republic of the Congo has experienced 10 outbreaks of the deadly Ebola virus since 1976. the northern part of the country.
Here to tell, give us an update on the situation in the DRC is Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases at the NIH and recipient of the Presidential Medal of Freedom. Welcome back to Science Friday.
ANTHONY FAUCI: Good to be with you, Ira.
IRA FLATOW: Tell us about this current outbreak. Give us some of the ABCs of it, please.
ANTHONY FAUCI: Well, it‚Äôs in a totally different location than the first outbreak that we had early in the year that you mentioned, Ira, which was in the western part of the country. This is 2,500 kilometers to the east of this. It‚Äôs in the northeast part of the country right by the border of Uganda and Rwanda. It is already considerably larger than the first outbreak earlier in the year that have been now as of last night 103 total cases with 63 deaths.
The situation there is a bit more problematic than we‚Äôre used to. Democratic Republic of the Congo, as you said, has considerable experience over the years. This is their 10th outbreak. The problem is that the outbreak is occurring right at or near the area of rebel fighting with a number of different rebel groups making it a real security issue of being able to do the kind of identification contact tracing and the contacts of the contacts, which is the way that you put down these kinds of epidemics.
So it is still in the escalating phase. We have to watch it very carefully. We‚Äôve deployed the vaccine that we used with some success in the West Africa outbreak already in the ring vaccination approach, which means vaccinating the contacts and the contacts of the contacts of people who are known cases. There have been 2,625 vaccinations thus far, and we‚Äôve also deployed some experimental drugs that are being given there, monoclonal antibodies and other drugs that have been developed.
So there‚Äôs some good news in the sense of we have interventions that we didn‚Äôt have a few years ago with the West Africa outbreak, but the sobering news is the location of where it‚Äôs occurring, which is in a high security place.
IRA FLATOW: So you‚Äôre actually using some of the new vaccine to try to fight.
ANTHONY FAUCI: Yes. The vesicular stomatitis virus, the V, as V-vectored vaccine that we did and are still involved in a clinical trial to determine immunogenicity and safety that we utilized in a ring vaccination program in Guinea back a couple of years ago during the ‚Äô14, ‚Äô15, ‚Äô16 outbreak. That is being deployed now on the contacts and the contacts of the contacts, and that‚Äôs the 2,600 plus vaccinations that we were using right now literally as we speak.
IRA FLATOW: And how long do you think this outbreak might run its course?
ANTHONY FAUCI: You know, Ira, it really is impossible to say because the way that you can put these down and get control of them is if you identify the cases themselves, put them in isolation. Because as you well know from the previous outbreaks, the most susceptible people are the people who are taking care of the individuals who are sick, either family members or health care providers, people who bury the bodies when people die.
And the situation is, we‚Äôre seeing that same sort of thing. We‚Äôre seeing a number of health care workers who‚Äôve gotten infected. Having said that, it‚Äôs impossible to predict until you get the cases all accounted for who are the contacts. It‚Äôs a 21-day incubation period, and to say that something is over, you have to go through two cycles of 21 days without a new case.
So it would have to be 42 days from the last identified case. And we‚Äôre still in the upswing of the outbreak. So I think we‚Äôre far away from saying that this is over by any stretch of the imagination.
IRA FLATOW: I want to thank you again, Dr. Fauci, for keeping us up to date and coming on Science Friday, and we‚Äôll be following up with you.
ANTHONY FAUCI: Good to be with you.
IRA FLATOW: Thank you. Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Health, the Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases at the NIH.
Public health officials may not be able to control when and where an outbreak occurs, but with the right strategy, they can keep it from becoming an epidemic. Researchers are testing a new strategy out on yellow fever, a virus that emerged in Brazil last year and threatened major population centers like Sao Paolo and Rio de Janeiro.
Dr. Nuno Faria is Royal Society research fellow at the University of Oxford in the UK. His team was the first to use real-time genome sequencing of yellow fever virus to track where it came from and which groups might be at risk. He joins me now. Dr. Faria, welcome to Science Friday.
NUNO FARIA: Thank you. Thank you very much for the invitation.
IRA FLATOW: Well, we know that yellow fever is different from Ebola in that it‚Äôs carried by a mosquito, and I understand there are two ways of transmitting it. Can you explain what those are?
NUNO FARIA: Yes. So there is this sylvatic or jungle yellow fever transmission, and there‚Äôs the urban yellow fever transmission. So at the jungle yellow fever transmission is the transmission of the virus between non-human primates, for example monkeys and mosquito species that are found in the forest canopies. And those normally are [INAUDIBLE] mosquitoes, so these viruses that are transmitted by the mosquitoes from non-human primates to humans when humans are visiting or working in the forest.
So in contrast, urban yellow fever transmission involves the transmission of the virus between humans and urban mosquitoes. Primarily, they‚Äôre very commonly found in Aedes aegypti, which is the same mosquito that transmits Zika and chikungunya in many other infectious diseases.
So in this case, the virus usually enters the urban area when it‚Äôs introduced from a virionic human that was infected in the jungle.
IRA FLATOW: So how are you able to use genetic sequencing to tell this was a jungle transmission and not the urban transmission?
NUNO FARIA: So we actually combine different sources of information. Genetic [AUDIO OUT] is one of the information that we use. So we know that viruses like yellow fever, Zika, HIV, or Ebola accumulate mutations over time. Sometimes we find mutations accumulated in viruses that have been collected from patients only a few weeks apart or sometimes months or years, depending on how fast that virus mutates or evolves.
That depends on several factors including the own replication, the sharing of the virus. For example, for yellow fever, we know that a yellow fever virus evolves roughly, accumulates roughly 1 to 10 mutations in the genomes over a year at the population level. So we use the information as the number of mutations accumulating per genomes over time to actually reconstruct a phylogenetic tree, so the genealogy of the virus or the evolutionary tree.
And based upon that, I mean based on the evolutionary tree of yellow fever of not only humans, but also non-human primates, we were able to reconstruct ancestral species being non-human primates, in this case, and we were able to reconstruct the spillover events between non-human primates and humans over time.
IRA FLATOW: And knowing this genetic history, does it get you any closer to treating people with the disease or preventing it?
NUNO FARIA: So what we can find with this sort of information, we can find the origins of the outbreak, we can find the source populations of the outbreak, and we can ultimately trace that place and how and when the spillover events were maximum and which locations did this happen and in which specific seasons did it happen the most frequently.
IRA FLATOW: And how does that help in treating people?
NUNO FARIA: Well, ideally, we could incorporate that information. Obviously, this stems from the more general goal of improved surveillance in not only humans, but also non-human primate populations and vector population. So if we increase surveillance in all different populations at the same time, we can definitely benefit from that in the sense that a target vaccination in key areas where there is increased transmission.
IRA FLATOW: That‚Äôs interesting. So how fast is this technology moving? Is this the first time it‚Äôs been used this way?
NUNO FARIA: So genomic sequencing, portable genomic sequencing using MinION has been actually first used in an Ebola outbreak back in 2016 in Guinea. And then later, we brought that technology to the Zika virus outbreak during our Zebra Project, which we drove 2,000 kilometers in most affected areas in Northeast Brazil with several portable handheld iron sequencers to capture a little bit better the Zika virus epidemic at it‚Äôs epicenter. And now we have to use it for real in a few more weeks, and we extended these protocols for reality.
But it‚Äôs very easy to extend these protocols to other viruses, and we are currently trying and testing these protocols [AUDIO OUT] the other and mosquito-borne infections that might be the next big Zika or yellow fever epidemics in Brazil.
IRA FLATOW: So you‚Äôre limited, from what I hear you saying, to applying this to mosquito-borne infections. Why limit it? Because we were just talking about Ebola. Could you use it for Ebola?
NUNO FARIA: Yes, of course. As I mentioned, it was first used actually to Ebola to tackle the Ebola outbreak back in 2015, and it was essential to track transmission chains in air back in 2015, and it increased [AUDIO OUT] in the current outbreak.
IRA FLATOW: So you think it could be used in this current outbreak?
NUNO FARIA: Yeah. I‚Äôm sure. It‚Äôs already been here, so that‚Äôs the [VIDEO OUT] and also very flexible. So it‚Äôs not only being used for viruses, but also for diphtheria and that even reports of flu genomes of humans being actually sequenced using the benign sequencer. So it‚Äôs a very portable and very flexible material that can be very easily sort of expanded to a broad range of pathogen in organisms.
IRA FLATOW: But is it expensive to use? Could countries that don‚Äôt have a robust health system be able to afford it?
NUNO FARIA: So we were able to generate genomes for under $50 per genome. So that‚Äôs quite cheap to other technologies. But indeed, for example, we have also extended our project to other countries in African settings. For example, Angola where we have been recently, we were able inside, without having to be shipped to our samples. So in the country, we were able to generate some Zika virus genomes there.

‚Äì Getting Started & Next StepsThe prospects of adopting Chinese nuclear reactors in China and internationally has become a regular topic among nuclear energy providers, governments and investors, because the need for new nuclear power generation in Europe and beyond is rising, and financing ‚Äì outside state funding ‚Äì is rarely available. China can offer both nuclear reactors and finance as Rumyana Vakarelska reports.
China‚Äôs independently developed Generation III Hualong One PWR reactor design is expected to see its first two demonstration units in operation in China in the second half of 2016, according to China National Nuclear Corporation (CNNC). It is expected to be ready for a series of new construction projects after that date.
CNNC says that its version of the reactor is an ‚Äúindependently-innovative outcome from 60 years of research ability and 30
years of practice and experience in nuclear power R&D‚Äù. The company adds that it ‚Äúhas become the brand designated for our nuclear power technology export strategy. HPR is well-based on nuclear power self-reliance and localisation, incorporates abundant experience in construction and operation, and has strong economic advantages.‚Äù
CGN in a 2016 corporate report on its version of the Hualong One describes the reactor technology as a reactor that ‚Äúadopts both active and passive safety design concepts, fully implements the defence-in- depth design principle in a balanced way and takes sound precautions against severe accidents and mitigation measures in case of accidents‚Äù.
CGN adds that ‚Äúauxiliary safety systems can be customised. The targeted localisation rate of the engineering equipment for the first reactor is more than 85%, which can help further enhance domestic equipment manufacturing and lower the engineering cost‚Äù.
The rate of China‚Äôs new nuclear construction is at present well ahead of that in either Russia or France. This trend is expected to continue as Chinese nuclear technology advances and the country‚Äôs domestic nuclear capacity expands.
Rival designs
This year, CNNC and CGN announced that they have established a joint venture, Hualong International Nuclear Technology, to export the Hualong One design. The joint venture officially opened and started work in March 2016, the two companies said in a joint statement at that time, although plans for the joint venture had been established late in 2015.
Hualong One is the first Generation III reactor design for which China owns all intellectual property rights. The earlier versions of Hualong One were CNNC‚Äôs ACP1000 and China General Nuclear Corporation‚Äôs (CGN) ACPR1000+ reactors.
Westinghouse is building two AP1000 PWRs at Sanmen and Haiyang in China, after which intellectual property rights for the reactor in China transfer to the Chinese side.
The first Hualong One pilot project is under construction in Fujian province. CNNC says that the reactor has achieved a breakthrough in the calculation and analysis software, reactor core design, fuelling, and active and passive safety technology.
So far six Hualong One units have been approved for development. Construction started at Fuqing 5 and 6, China‚Äôs first two units using the design, with the first pouring of nuclear concrete on 7th May 2015, and 22nd December 2015, respectively. ‚ÄòFirst concrete‚Äô at a new plant marks the actual start of reactor construction, whereas civil and preparatory work may have been done in advance.
The second and third units at the Karachi nuclear power plant in Pakistan are the first overseas projects to use Hualong One technology. China and Pakistan signed contracts to build the two units in 2013. The second unit at Karachi poured first concrete on 20th August 2015. The third unit at the site, which will also use the Hualong One design, was expected to pour first concrete in the middle of June, said CNNC.
Challenges for Chinese reactor design in Europe
However, introducing Hualong One into Europe and expanding in that market ‚Äúis more tricky‚Äù, according to a senior director of a UK nuclear company. ‚ÄúGeneric Design Assessment (GDA) of Hualong One cannot commence until EDF makes its final investment decision (FID) for Hinkley Point C in the UK, which is the first European country to adopt the reactor in the middle of the next decade.
‚ÄúWithout this nothing is certain and the UK government is not going to allow GDA of Hualong 1 to commence without signed contracts,‚Äù the director said.
His main arguments were that it will take at least four or five years for the Hualong One design to get through the GDA regulatory approval process. The company would have to consider what the European landscape might look like by then and see what opportunities might be open for the Chinese design.
By that time, he suggested there would be very limited ‚Äì if any ‚Äì interest from any additional European countries in wanting to build new nuclear reactors. ‚ÄúThose countries that are developing nuclear will be well down the path with what technology is available today ‚Äì Poland, for example, already has five teams competing for its new nuclear projects ‚Äì and the Chinese design is not included‚Äù, according to the expert.
Looking at European countries with existing nuclear, he said Finland will be focusing on completing the projects it has started (the Olkiluoto 3 EPR and the Fennovoima VVER). ‚ÄúFrance will not be doing any new builds after the Flamanville 3 EPR. Hungary is using Russian technology, while Romania will go for Candu technology. The Czech Republic may come back to the table in the next five years and could possibly consider the Chinese [design].
‚ÄúThere may be other Eastern European countries developing new nuclear, such as Ukraine, where funding might be important, but strategic considerations also come into play‚Äù, the director said. ‚ÄúI think the European market is going to be quite difficult for new nuclear prospects, unless there is a change in approach from the EU that encourages nuclear as a low carbon source; rather than focusing on renewables‚Äù.
‚ÄúChina is keen to get its design licensed in the UK and to an EU standard. The UK‚Äôs GDA is perceived as providing one of the world‚Äôs highest regulatory standards,‚Äù the UK director said. Meanwhile, China could be investing of the order of ¬£12 billion to get a third share of the Hinkley Point C and Sizewell EPR projects, before taking on two-thirds of the investment in a plant at in Bradwell in Essex.
Stephen Thomas, professor of energy policy at the University of Greenwich said: ‚ÄúThe fate of Areva will be key to CGN and to a lesser extent CNNC.
‚ÄúReports that Mitsubishi will invest in Areva and promote the Atmea One design mean there will be no space for CGN and their Hualong One design in Areva, which will not want two 1000MW designs. It also depends on whether Areva can be rescued as a going concern and taken over by EDF or whether its potential liabilities are so large it will have to be abandoned‚Äù.
‚ÄúCGN has made no commitment to fund the Hinkley Point C plant and the Chinese side may be disillusioned with the French industry and its cost and time overruns, sub-standard components and financial weakness,‚Äù according to Thomas.
If, as seems increasingly likely, Hinkley Point C is abandoned it will depend whether the whole nuclear programme is abandoned, in which case Bradwell will go, or the Horizon/ NuGen/CGN projects are fast-tracked, Thomas said, referring to the various current new nuclear construction scenarios in the UK.
Thomas noted that apart from completing one or two old Candu reactors in Romania, he does not see any other prospects for CGN in Europe. ‚ÄúCNNC does not seem to have any strong export prospects. The best, Argentina, as SPI (strong performance indicator), is hard to read. Start of construction of the first CAP1400 in China is continually delayed and an order from Turkey is a long way from being signed‚Äù, Thomas said.
As a result the Hualong One design might not be submitted to the UK regulator, the Office of Nuclear Regulation (ONR) this year. It is questionable whether CGN has a clear idea of how fully developed a design has to be to submit it to GDA, said Thomas. He suggested that the Chinese company was relying on EDF to help with that process, but EDF has other priorities. ‚ÄúI think it is significant that CGN has not specified how many reactors it wants for Bradwell, therefore there is not a fixed time scale for project delivery,‚Äù he said.
Pollution in China is an opportunity for new nuclear
Nuclear energy might not be the whole solution but it is part of the solution in China, according to Jean-Marie Bourgeois-Demersay, French dean, China-French Institute of Nuclear Engineering and Technology, IFCEN, Sun Yat-sen University. Bourgeois-Dermersay said that was because a key issue in China was clean air.
Cao Shudong, vice president, CNNC agreed that China has a severe problem with smog. The big problem is the energy mix, and emissions and pollution from thermal power in particular. This represents a big opportunity for nuclear in China. Although new nuclear has become a bigger challenge after the Fukushima accident in 2011, the opportunity is still there, Cao said.
‚ÄúChina intends to have 58,000MW of nuclear capacity in operation in 2020, but even with this, nuclear will only make for three percent of the energy mix in the country‚Äù, Cao said.
China is also seeking to expand its nuclear manufacturing industry and plans to export its Hualong One reactors to a number of countries, including South Africa. Last November Argentina and China reached a framework agreement for a fifth nuclear unit in Argentina. This will be the country‚Äôs first PWR, but the country has chosen Chinese technology. According to Argentina‚Äôs planning ministry, the CNNC version of the Hualong One will contain 177 fuel assemblies, adopting the core design of CNNC‚Äôs ACP1000 reactor and its CF series of fuel.
‚ÄúChina is very interested in what each country does well and is learning fast from that, in the face of, CGN‚Äôs construction of two EPRs in Taishan and EDF/Areva, where CGN is the French utilities‚Äô industrial partner,‚Äù according to Bourgeois-Dermersay.
The role of Chinese SMRs
In addition to the Hualong One, China is also seeking to develop a small modular reactor (SMR). SMRs are currently the subject of a global technology race, with the UK, US and Chinese governments all competing to encourage construction of the first full scale SMR design in their countries by the mid-2020s.
‚ÄúPublic acceptance is one of the biggest challenges facing the SMR market in China,‚Äù said Shuai Jianyun, director of the CGN Research Institute. However, he said he was confident that SMRs can find a successful place in China and internationally.
Canada, which already has significant nuclear generation, is one potential home for SMRs. Ron Oberth, director of the Association of Canadian Nuclear Industries, listed the advantages of Canada for international nuclear investors, without directly naming China as a future bidder for Canadian nuclear construction. He said the regulator is flexible and technology neutral, and SMRs in the range of 100MW to 300MW would be an ideal solution to replace coal plants in Canada.
Consulting engineers Hatch undertook an SMR deployment study for Canada in June 2016, considering them for remote sites in Ontario. It found that if 50% supply chain content from Ontario could be achieved, there would be $4 billion (¬£3.02 billion) worth of economic benefit for the Canadian province. According to the study, site-specific licence applications should be done by 2022-23, and deployment might be expected later in the 2020s.A unity but the group said that has to change.
The forum made up of professional bodies, artisans, trade unions, students, farmers and religious bodies across the country, said Nigeria as a great nation has the potential and capacity to sustain the rest of Africa and beyond if ‚Äúthe big gap in our nation today which came about as a result of lack of trust, lack of unity, misunderstanding, personal and sectional interests among others are closed.‚Äù
Addressing a press conference Monday in Abuja, the national chairman of the forum, Alhaji Gambo Lawan, called on all political parties and leaders, religious and traditional rulers, professional bodies to join the movement.
In attendance also were some popular Nollywood, Kannywood and other prominent Nigerians.
According to Lawan, other countries in the world have experienced similar challenges at one stage or the other but they held on to one thing which helped them overcome and that thing is, ‚Äòputting their nations first‚Äô.
‚ÄúOur nation is blessed with both human and natural resources. Nigeria as a great nation has the potential and capacity to sustain the rest of Africa and beyond. These are God‚Äôs blessings which no one, no tribe, no religion can lay claim to. And as such, we owe it a duty to sustain these God given gifts by uniting, and understanding on another, building our nation and securing the future.
‚ÄúAs patriots, the National Interest Forum sees the need to close the big gap in our nation today which came about as a result of lack of trust, lack of unity, misunderstanding, personal and sectional interests among others. But the good news is, our nation has the capacity and potential to surmount all these challenges which are not peculiar to our nation, Nigeria.
‚ÄúWe, the members of National Interest Forum today call on all Nigerians, irrespective of creed, tribe or tongue to come out and join this movement in order to bring Nigerians together to have a united front determined to put our nation first, before self, tribe or religion, in everything we do.
‚ÄúWe therefore call on all political parties and leaders, religious and traditional rulers, professional bodies to join in this movement so that we can begin to re-orientate our people as we put our nation first.
‚ÄúIn the coming days and weeks, we will be engaging our people through town hall meetings in all the states of the federation in order to be sensitised on the need for everyone to put our nation first in all our dealings. We are glad to declare today, this hashtag #OurNation First. And we are optimistic that Nigeria will regain and remain the giant of Africa that it has been. God bless our nation, Nigeria.‚ÄùCorrelation Table: Added USD/Indian Rupee
I decided to add the currency of the worlds biggest or at least second biggest gold consumer, and the biggest silver consumer to my correlation table, namely the Indian Rupee (INR). One would think that the strength of India‚Äôs currency, ergo the international purchasing power of the indian gold and silver consumer, should at least play a role as to where prices are moving even in US dollar terms. The Rupee showed a decent correlation with GLD, but especially the gold miner indices GDX and GDXJ‚Ä¶
- Correlation table for 2010.01.01 ‚Äì 2017-04-04 based on Daily Adjusted Close from Yahoo Finance:
Note that the negative correlation for USD/Rupee and GLD, SLV, GDX and GDXJ means that when the Rupee strengthens versus the US dollar, the metals and miners also seem to show a positive performance. It is also interesting to see the Rupee being a decent amount more correlated with silver than gold, a stronger correlation jump compared to the Japanese Yen.
- Given that I am heavily invested in the sector I thought it would be interesting to create a graph showing GLD vs USD/INR, to see if the Rupee could be of any help in regards of spotting trends in the precious metal space:
The graph above backs up the data in the correlation table pretty nicely, in that USD/INR multi month trends seem to move in the opposite way of GLD during the same time period. The green rectangles shows periods when the Rupee is weakening and GLD strengthening. The red rectangles show the opposite action in both assets. If the Rupee indeed has bottomed after forming a triple top in USD/INR, then going by recent history, we should be in the beginning stages of a full blown bull market in gold.
- Since the Rupee showed an even bigger correlation with SLV than GLD starting from 2010 I also graphed USD/INR vs SLV:
Since the volatility in silver is much larger than gold, and especially a currency, it‚Äôs harder to compare it with the Rupee in a graph. However, one can still make out that silver (like gold), seems to trade with the Rupee, ergo counter to the USD/INR exchange rate trend.
Conclusion
Given the correlation data and the graphs it seems prudent to watch the development of the currency attributed to largest or second largest consumer of gold and the single biggest consumer of silver. It‚Äôs also interesting to see that although USD/JPY showed stronger correlation with the metals and miners (probably because HFT trading/manipulation), the USD/INR seems to have a larger correlation percentage jump from gold to silver than the Yen. This may be because India is the largest player in the actual PHYSICAL silver market.
Also the fact that USD/INR shows very strong correlation with the mining indices I take it as a BIG bullish sign that the Rupee may indeed have put in a huge triple bottom versus the US dollar (USD/INR triple top).The Genealogy of Jesus
1The book of the genealogy of Jesus Christ, the son of David, the son of Abraham.
2Abraham begat Isaac; and Isaac begat Jacob; and Jacob begat Judah and his brothers;
3And Judah begat Perez and Zerah of Tamar; and Perez begat Hezron and Hezron begat Ram;
4And Ram begat Amminidab; and Ammin Joatham; and Joatham brothers, about the time they were carried away to Babylon:
12And after they were brought to Babylon, Jeconiah begat Shealtiel; and Shealtiel begat Zerubbabel;
13And Zerubbabel begat Abihud; and Abihud begat Eliakim; and Eliakim begat Azor;
14And Azor begat Zadok; and Zad
18Now the birth of Jesus Christ happened this way: When his mother Mary was espoused to Joseph, before they came together, she was found to be with child of the Holy Spirit.
19Then Joseph her husband, being a just man, and not willing to make her a public example, decided to put her away privately.
20But while he thought on these things, behold, the angel of the Lord appeared unto him in a dream, saying, Joseph, son of David, fear not to take unto you Mary your wife: for that which is conceived in her is of the Holy Spirit.
21And she shall bring forth a son, and you shall.Physical Therapy Can Improve Balance
If you have fallen, then you may understand how scary this can be. A fall can lead to injury, and it may have a significant impact on how you move. Physical therapy may be a helpful modality of care to pursue if you have fallen, and your PT may also be able to help you prevent falls.
Where Does Balance Come From?
Three systems in our body help keep you upright against the force of gravity. Our three balance systems are:
The visual system. Your eyes give you information about where you are in your environment and what is happening around you.
The vestibular system. The vestibular system is a small organ in your inner ear that gives your brain information about the position of your head. Then, nerves work with this system to coordinate proper eye movements. Impairments to your vestibular system may lead to dizziness, loss of balance, and falls.
The proprioception system. Your proprioceptive system is a collection of nerves in your muscles and joints that tell your brain where your body is and how it is moving. These nerves constantly tell your brain what surface you are standing upon, how your muscles are moving, and can help coordinate futures movements. Impairments to the proprioceptive system may lead to falling.
When these three systems are functioning properly, you can see what's around you, feel where you are in your environment, and you can make adjustments in your body movements and positions to prevent falling. If one or more of these systems is impaired, it may lead to increased risk of falling.
Stats About Falling
If you are an older person, there are some sobering statistics about falling that you should be aware of. These include:
One in four Americans over the age of 65 will fall down each year.
One in three Americans over the age of 75 fall each year.
Falls are the seconds leading cause of accidental death in persons over age 65.
If you are over age 75, one in four falls leads to permanent nursing home placement and care.
Bottom line: falls are dangerous, may lead to injury, and can significantly impact your quality of life.
PT for Balance and Falls Prevention
If you have fallen, or if you are concerned about falling and wish to improve your balance, it is a good idea to visit your local physical therapist. Your PT can assess your current condition and prescribe exercises to help improve balance and reduce the risk of falling.
Physical therapy for balance may include various components. These include:
Exercises to improve posture (poor posture can allow your center of gravity to move forward, leading to falling)
Neck and eye control exercises
Hip strengthening exercises
Lower extremity exercises
Balance and proprioception exercises
Physical therapy for balance should be specialized to meet your specific needs. Working closely with one of the PT's at Capital Region Physical Therapy in a one-on-one setting may be a good start for your balance program.
What Else Can You Do?
A sound falls prevention plan includes making changes to your environment. Some things you can do around the house to reduce the risk of falling may include:
Ensure adequate exterior and interior lighting is present.
Make sure your stairs have a sturdy hand rail.
Install grab bars in your shower or bath and near your commode.
Ensure throw rugs are stable (or eliminate throw rugs altogether.)
Keep clutter to a minimum
Making small changes around your home may help improve safety and decrease your risk of falling down. Speaking with your physician or physical therapist about your home environment and the changes your can make is a good idea.
Falling can be a scary thing and may have serious consequences. Many people are surprised that you can do things to improve your balance and mobility and decrease your risk of falls. Working one-on-one with a physical therapist at Capital Region Physical Therapy may be a helpful way to maintain and improve your balance and mobility and prevent falling. Give us a call at (518) 439-5006 to see if we can help you move better and feel more confident with your balance and mobility.Tasline Elite White is pure 8 strand, with no coatings or additives, leaving it silky smooth and supple for improved casting distance and extreme fishing like popping and jigging for trophy fish.

Almost three million individuals who were either self-employed sole traders or partners in a partnership had registered for 9.9 million grants by mid-August.
But many may have done so in error, because if their business was not adversely affected by the Covid-19 pandemic, they will have to pay the money back.
A North west accountant, Paul Hornby has warned that many grant recipients face unhappy new years as they realise they may owe HMRC tens of thousands in grant rebates.
He said: ‚ÄúThe grants were designed to support businesses that had, or predicted they would be, materially impacted in revenue terms by the Covid-19 pandemic.
‚ÄúThe reality is that many businesses actually thrived during the pandemic and, far from revenues being negatively impacted, they flourished.
‚ÄúIn these instances, the SEISS grants should never have been claimed. The government‚Äôs financial support package has been huge; by far its most significant fiscal intervention since the Second World War.
‚ÄúHaving dished out more than ¬£27bn in support grants, there‚Äôs no way they will idly sit back and allow individuals who should never have claimed them to keep the money.
‚ÄúThey will be looking for payback where it is due and my fear is that many people will not realise this.‚Äù
The government launched its Self Employment Income Support Scheme in March 2020, and there have been a total of five rounds of funding made available, with payments stopping at the end of September.
HMRC has issued guidance to recipients of grants, urging them to assess whether they were actually eligible for them.
Tax bosses have already been in touch with grant recipients and demanded they assess whether they need to repay some - or all - of the money they have received. That communication will ramp up in the coming weeks and months as HMRC demands answers.
Paul said: ‚ÄúPeople will fall into a number of categories here. There will be those who have claimed the grants in the full knowledge they were never.To work at the policy level is a core mission of the European Forum for Restorative Justice (EFRJ) with the aim to develop and improve restorative justice legal frame in Europe and beyond. The EFRJ, and its membership, is very active with regards to policy making in Europe at the level of the Council of Europe (CoE), the European Union (EU) and the United Nations (UN).
The EFRJ has provided significant input to the drafting and implementation of the main European and international documents such as the new Recommendation CM/Rec(2018)8 concerning restorative justice in criminal matters, the European Commission's Victims‚Äô Directive (2012/29/EU), the reviewed process of the UN Basic principles on the use of restorative justice programmes in criminal matters (ECOSOC Res. 2000/14) and the UN Handbook on Restorative Justice Programmes.
Thanks to our expertise and our strategic location in the heart of the European Union, we are able to contribute to high level policy events in Brussels and to engage in dialogues with EU policy makers, advocating for a more effective and comprehensive EU policy concerning restorative justice.
Beside these consultative roles with European and international bodies, our strategic goal in the coming years is to work more closely with national policy makers to help the better implementation of EU and other international legislation related to restorative justice. In this regard we launched (2018) the European Restorative Justice Policy Network (ERJPN) in order to create a more close link with policy makers and through this achieve a larger impact on national efforts on developing restorative justice in European countries.Yellow Daises PowerPoint Icon F

Co-A&E EDITOR
I always associated the term ‚Äúsenioritis‚Äù with being a high school senior who didn‚Äôt want to do work because all they wanted to do was graduate and go to college. They were simply ready to start a new chapter of your life and getting through that last stretch of senior year was agonizing.
Now, what I didn‚Äôt associate ‚Äúsenioritis‚Äù with was being a senior in college.
I didn‚Äôt think that an adult could allow themselves to feel just as lazy as their high school senior-self did.
Yet, here I am.
Here I am, procrastinating doing my work, not wanting to go to class, having difficulty focusing, and wanting nothing more than to walk across that stage and get my degree and starting my post-graduate career.
However, the senioritis I felt being the 18-year-old graduating high school vs the 22-year-old graduating college is that now I have a lot more at stake.
This time things are much more real.
My decisions hold so much more weight than they ever have, which sucks, but I guess this is what adulting is, which also sucks.
But in the midst of all things that suck, and how even though I‚Äôm feeling the laziest I have ever felt in my either life, I know I won‚Äôt give up.
I didn‚Äôt give up and then I most definitely won‚Äôt now.
For the same reason that I have way too much to lose and knowing that in completing this last stretch I will be accomplishing something that not many people in my family have done; which is to actually go to and finish college.
And yes, this is a lot of pressure, but I try not to think about it because even though many people in my family have not finished college, many have gone on to be successful in their own right. So, my success won‚Äôt be measured on the degree I get, but rather in the whole accomplishment of graduating college.
So, I know I have to keep pushing and even in those moments when I don‚Äôt want to go to class, or don‚Äôt want to do my work, and would much rather get a drink with my friends, I have to finish.
I just wish that during this tough time, where it is taking ever ounce of my being to do anything, which includes writing this; I wish I had someone else to tell me that college senioritis was a thing!
Because I really didn‚Äôt think it was!
Now, would it have made a difference in whether I had known about it before or not?
Probably not, but it would have taken away that initial guilt.
So, to the rest of the Class of 2019, if you are feeling like you are ready to throw in the towel; that you are over doing anything and everything work related, just think about why you came to college.
Think about that high school senior you once were. The one that was so eager to start the next chapter of their life. Now, think about how far you‚Äôve come and where you are going once it is all said and done.
Senioritis is as real as it has ever been, and though it‚Äôs hard to deal with, it also just shows that you are ready to turn the page and start a new part of your life.Become friends with OTi and compare your movie tastes.

Wool is naturally insulating and has many excellent qualities that make it a strong choice of material for many types of clothing and homeware. Because of its self-cleaning ability, wool garments can often be aired instead of washed. Many of our essential cardigans and sweaters are knitted in carefully-selected soft yarn blends of lambswool, alpaca and organic wool. Interested in finding out more about our materials?

is expanding its outsourcing for global electronics
manufacturing through two separate deals with Solectron
and
Sanmina-SCI
.
IBM says the reason for doing these manufacturing deals with Sanmina-SCI and
Solectron is because it wants to ‚Äúoptimize its supply chain for e-business on demand.‚Äù
IBM‚Äôs deal with Sanmina-SCI is a three year contract worth $3.6 billion,
while Solectron inked a $120 million, three year deal. The two deals are
expected to close in February.
IBM will be specifically outsourcing the manufacturing of what it calls a
‚Äúsignificant portion of its low and midrange eServer xSeries systems and
IntelliStation workstations for customers in the Americans, mainland Europe,
the Middle East and Africa.‚Äù
As part of the outsourcing deal, Sanmina-SCI will also acquire IBM
manufacturing operations in Mexico and Scotland for some desktop and laptop
computer manufacturing. However, IBM will continue to make the bulk of its
ThinkPad notebooks worldwide in Shenzhen, China.
In its deal with IBM, Solectron is taking over most of the manufacturing
operations for IBM‚Äôs Global Asset Recovery Services, which restores
end-of-lease PCs and other IT equipment for resale. Solectron will acquire
IBM‚Äôs refurbishing center in Research Triangle Park, N.C.
The deal marks Solectron expansion into what it calls ‚Äúpost-manufacturing
services.‚Äù By taking over IBM‚Äôs asset recovery unit, Solectron now will be
involved in ‚Äúde-manufacturing, remanufacturing, refurbishment, recycling and
disposal services.‚Äù The North Carolina facility will integrate Solectron‚Äôs
existing worldwide network of 47 post-manufacturing facilities.
In the past year, in a bid to improve efficiency and profitability, IBM has
slashed $5 billion from its supply chain business through a variety of
deals. The IBM deals with Sanmina-SCI and Solectron now means that more than two-thirds of IBM‚Äôs Intel-based product manufacturing has been outsourced.Best Smartwatch Fitness Trackers in 2021 ‚Äì Top 7 Smartwatch Fitness Trackers Review

Quality control
Initially the couple sourced smallgoods from other suppliers, but grew dissatisfied with the level of produce on offer. In their quest for authenticity and quality, the Knoll‚Äôs made a course altering decision.
‚ÄúFor a short while we were trying to sell other peoples products but found it wasn‚Äôt as good as we wanted it to be; it wasn‚Äôt consistent,‚Äù says Knoll. ‚ÄúMum and Dad had a small kitchen here on the farm [so] we decided just to make a few of the fundamental simple products that we could.‚ÄúWe tried to be that extra ingredient, that bit of home, that bit of ‚Äòspecial‚Äô that people really appreciate‚Äù, says Knoll.
Future thinking
Although it took 18 years to reach a critical mass, the family‚Äôs commitment to a long-term vision has led to a successful and sustainable business that will provide opportunities for the next generation. In both its past and its future, family plays a central role at Barossa Fine Foods.
‚ÄúOur work is what drives us as a family because we have a joint goal. A lot of our decisions weren‚Äôt necessarily the best business decisions along the way but they were the best family decisions.‚Äù
In 2001 the fourth generation of the Knoll family smallgoods makers began work at age 16. Today, Dieter Knoll is in charge of the daily smallgoods production and continues the family traditions.
Lesson learnt: Honesty is the best policy
Barossa Fine Foods is not short on accolades, having been recognised with a bounty of awards, including 500 medals at the Sydney Royal Fine Food Awards, as well as numerous awards at the Royal Melbourne Fine Food Awards and AMIC State Smallgoods Competition.
23 years of experience has honed Knoll‚Äôs perspective on what makes a successful operation. ‚ÄúValue your business well, be honest in your business, if you‚Äôre honest people around you have to be more honest,‚Äù he says.
‚ÄúYou grow and you learn from mistakes. You grow and you learn from when people say things. And you can‚Äôt adapt and change things if people don‚Äôt get critique.
‚ÄúWe‚Äôre only here for the customer and we try to make that a unique proposition.‚Äù

From PCGamingWiki, the wiki about fixing PC games
Revision as of 14:45, 17 October 2021
This page is for the original game. For the remake, see Resident Evil HD Remaster.
Key points
- Poor compatibility with modern systems.
- Very poorly programmed; the game is linked to the speed of the processor, which results in the game moving very fast, and scripts are bugged when running the game on a processor faster than recommended by the official requirements of the game.
Availability
Essential improvements
Resident Evil Configuration Tool
- A fan-made config tool that facilitates video settings management and allows keyboard and joystick keys/buttons to be remapped.
Peixoto's patch
- Fixes the "Failed to initialize the Graphic Hardware Device.(3) error", forces the game to run at the correct speed, in HD and 32 bit color depth, and adds full compatibility with XInput controllers, among other things.
Resident Evil Classic REbirth
- Removes the need for Win95 or Win98/ME compatibility modes to start, fixes all frame rate issues, adds full compatibility with XInput, RawInput, and DirectInput controllers, adds several new resolutions and a borderless fullscreen mode, replaces Registry configuration with an INI textfile, removes the need for a physical CD-ROM drive installed on PC, and adds support for loading movie files from Hard Drives, translates the Japanese version into English.

Issues fixed
"Jill Bug"
- While playing with Jill the image freezes during the encounter with Barry after killing the first monster. This bug is active when your computer's performance is too high for your game requirements. To prevent this from happening it is necessary to decrease the FSB (Front Side Bus) frequency to reach a value that does not cause problems with the game, usually 100Mhz or 66Mhz. It is the frequency of the FSB clock that will determine how will the performance of the motherboard and processor of a machine. For those who do not have hardware with this configuration capability a less efficient alternative is to use software specialized in occupying processor resources to slow the execution of applications, known as "cpu killer".
"Failed to initialize the Graphic Hardware Device.(3)" error
- This issue is caused by incorrect detection of Z-buffer formats on AMD cards.
"The game would only be able to run only when Windows95" error
Installing the game
- During installation, the installer goes fullscreen like many 90's era installers did. An error message sometimes appears behind the fullscreen installer background. The error itself isn't a problem, but clicking 'OK' requires using Alt+Tab ‚Üπ or Ctrl+Alt+Del (and enter Task Manager) to be able to see said error. This might take a few tries since it's such a wonky process.
- This game is from an era where PC games asked what graphics card you had, and the list is very small and outdated. Pick the card that looks and runs best on your machine.
- By using Resident Evil Classic REbirth you do not need to install the game - it is made completely portable as it does not require Windows Registry information. By doing this, it is also possible to completely skip Graphics Card selection.What happens when you pin a message on Slack?

Listen and subscribe to our podcast: Via Apple Podcasts | Spotify | Stitcher
Sheriff's offices across the state handle such a diverse range of tasks that it can be challenging for the public to keep with them all. They serve eviction notices, investigate boating accidents, run jails and sometimes even patrol the streets, among other responsibilities.
Reader Barbara Kiedrowski specifically wanted to know the difference between the Hennepin County sheriff and local police departments. She sought an answer from Curious Minnesota, the Star Tribune's community reporting project fueled by great questions from inquisitive readers.
The Hennepin County Sheriff's Office is one of the largest law enforcement agencies in the state. It employs more than 800 people and has a budget of about $122 million, roughly $40 million shy of what Minneapolis allocated for its police department this year.
Unlike appointed police chiefs, however, sheriffs are elected by the public.
"The most important difference between the sheriff's office and police is that we serve at the will of the people," said Hennepin County Sheriff David Hutchinson, who was elected in 2018. "We don't have any obligation to input from county commissioners or political figures.
In Hennepin County, the largest chunk of the sheriff's responsibilities are running the state's largest jail and providing courthouse security. The downtown Minneapolis jail handles an average of 31,000 people each year and sheriff's deputies must transport inmates from jail and mental health facilities to court appearances. The county has seven courthouses in four cities.
But state law requires county sheriff's offices to perform many other duties. They must pursue and apprehend felons, for example, and help with civil court matters like carrying out evictions and selling foreclosed properties. They must also investigate boating accidents and search for drowned bodies and lost persons.
"If somebody unfortunately drowned in a hotel swimming pool in Minneapolis, we would investigate," Hutchinson said.
The county also handles 911, fire and other emergency dispatch services for nearly all of the county's 45 cities except Minneapolis, Bloomington, Richfield, Edina and St. Louis Park, Hutchinson said.
Sometimes sheriff's deputies effectively act as the local police department. The small jurisdictions of Medicine Lake, Greenfield, Hanover and Fort Snelling ‚Äî which is unincorporated ‚Äî contract with the sheriff's office for patrol service.
The county also processes permits to carry firearms. More than 11,000 permits were issued last year.
Not everything the office does is required under state law. The sheriff's office has units that handle a variety of non-mandatory criminal and forensic investigations and assistance to other cities.
The county's crime lab analyzes DNA, firearms and fingerprints for local police and other agencies, for example. The office frequently assists the bigger cities and the University of Minnesota on cases, such as being asked to coordinate security at the large protests in Brooklyn Center after the fatal shooting of Daunte Wright by a police officer.
A group of deputies do round-the-clock security at the county's largest hospitals and offer classes to the public on how to administer Narcan, a drug that can prevent deaths from opioid overdoses.
Hutchison was a sergeant with the Metro Transit Police Department before he decided to run for sheriff in 2018.
"I am in direct contact with the people, no matter what their political affiliation," he said. "I hear what the community wants and can put it into practice."
Hutchinson has made a number of changes since coming into office. This fall, he curtailed the use of the county jail for detaining people on immigration charges. His office has also launched several new programs for jail inmates, including education services and opioid treatment.

A11) Mr. Borjas is himself an immigrant, having at age 12 fled from Cuba to Miami with his widowed mother in 1962, just before the Cuban Missile Crisis shut down legal exits. As a labor economist, he has spent much of his academic career studying the effects of immigration on the American jobs market, often arguing that immigration depresses wages, or job opportunities, at the lower end of the scale. Here he notes that, on balance, the added production supplied by immigrants makes a modest contribution to U.S. economic growth. He generously provides readers with arguments on all sides, including Milton Friedman‚Äôs wry observation that illegal immigrants are of more net benefit to the American economy than legals because they make less use of welfare-state services.
. . .
After totting up the pluses and minuses, Mr. Borjas concludes that immigration has very little effect on the lives of most Americans. He does worry, however, that some future wave might bring along with it the ‚Äúinstitutional, cultural and political baggage that may have hampered development in the poor countries‚Äù from which immigrants often come, and he sees a need for reforms.

The Paradox of the Heap is also known as Sorites Paradox (sorites being the Greek word for heap). It's a concept that you'll hear many talk about in wealth generation which can be applied to health and fitness.
The thought experiment goes like this:
Suppose someone comes along and puts a large pile of sand on a table. They then proceed to move the sand, one grain at a time to another location on the table. There's no way the new collection of sand is a heap. It is simply a collection of grains of sand. However, if one were to diligently pursue this transfer process, the inital heap would no longer be a heap. Furthermore, there would come a time when transferring just one grain would effectively create a new heap.
In Gretchen Rubin, author of Better than Before: Mastering the Habits of our Everyday Lives, refers to this paradox as the "One Coin Problem". Giving a man one coin at a time does not make him rich, but you will reach a point where one coin will cause him to be classified as "rich".
Examples of this paradox exist in fitness, where daily efforts amount to barely anything, until one day results magically appear. The act of lifting weights does not make you stronger, but do it enough times and allow for adequate rest, and you will become stronger. No single meal will make you ripped or toned, but three months of clean eating will cause you to transform your body.
This is the paradox that we all struggle with. Your health is made up of tiny choices made throughout the day. No choice is inherently good or bad and will have little effect on your health. However, the series of choices you make, the habits you have formed, the environment you have created for yourself - each make up little grains could potential grow your heap.
The journey is a struggle and a grind, but some days, when you look back, you'll realize that you've made progress.
Gretchen Rubin on adopting new habits.
#motivation #challenge #journey #habitsThe Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit held today that the Securities and Exchange Commission may bring an enforcement action based on allegedly foreign securities transactions involving non-U.S. residents if sufficient conduct occurred in the United States.
The ruling in SEC v. Scoville and Traffic Monsoon, LLC (No. 17-4059) is the first appellate decision to resolve whether the Dodd-Frank Act succeeded in allowing the Government to pursue such claims. The court acknowledged reach of U.S. law is not a ‚Äújurisdictional‚Äù issue. But the court ruled that, despite Congress‚Äôs mistake in framing Dodd-Frank‚Äôs provisions as ‚Äújurisdictional,‚Äù rather than substantive, Congress had clearly intended to allow the SEC and the United States to sue based on conduct or effects within the United States, regardless of where the securities transactions occurred.
Legal Background
For several decades before the Supreme Court‚Äôs 2010 decision in Morrison,:
‚Ä¢ ‚Äúconduct within the United States that constitutes significant steps in furtherance of the violation, even if the securities transaction occurs outside the United States and involves only foreign investors; or ‚Ä¢  laws for SEC enforcement actions based on the ‚Äúconduct and effects‚Äù test.
The District Court‚Äôs Ruling
The District Court acknowledged that defendants were correct that ‚Äúthe plain language of Section 929P(b) did not explicitly overturn the core holding of Morrison,‚Äù in that ¬ß 929P(b) addressed only the court‚Äôs ‚Äújurisdiction‚Äù without amending the substantive scope of the securities statutes. But the court nevertheless held noted: ‚ÄúTo conform Section 929P(b) to the Morrison opinion at the last minute would be like requiring a steaming battleship to turn on a dime to retrieve a lifejacket that had fallen overboard.‚Äù.
The Tenth Circuit‚Äôs Decision
The Tenth Circuit affirmed. The majority concluded that Congress ‚Äúclearly indicated‚Äù through the Dodd-Frank amendments ‚Äúthat the antifraud provisions apply when either significant steps are taken in the United States to further a violation of those antifraud provisions or conduct outside the United States has a foreseeable substantial effect within the United States.‚Äù (The third member of the panel concurred in the judgment, seeing no need to reach the Dodd-Frank issue because she viewed the transactions as sufficiently domestic under Morrison.)
The majority retraced the overlapping chronologies of the ‚Äúconduct and effects‚Äù test, the Morrison case, and the evolution of the Dodd-Frank Act. The court explained that the ‚Äúconduct and effects‚Äù test had originally been viewed as a jurisdictional issue, that the Second Circuit in 2008 had urged Congress to address the reach of the antifraud provisions, and that Congress had started doing so in 2009, with proposed amendments that eventually became ¬ß 929P(b) of the Dodd-Frank Act. In the middle of this activity, the Supreme Court ruled in 2010 that the extraterritorial application of the federal securities laws is not a jurisdictional issue, but that decision was issued on the final day of the joint congressional committee‚Äôs efforts to iron out differences between the House and Senate versions of what became the Dodd-Frank amendments. Any discontinuity between the Morrison decision and Dodd-Frank‚Äôs ‚Äújurisdictional‚Äù amendments thus slipped through the cracks.
The majority therefore ruled that, ‚Äú[n]otwithstanding.‚Äù
Implications
The Scoville ruling is probably not unexpected. Even though Congress failed to conform the Dodd-Frank amendments to Morrison‚Äôs decree about what is and is not ‚Äújurisdictional,‚Äù Congress‚Äôs intent seems to have been relatively clear.Scoville is the first appellate case to squarely resolve the alleged drafting problem in Dodd-Frank, just as the District Court‚Äôs decision was the first lower-court ruling to have done so. Prior district-court decisions had dodged the issue by determining that the SEC‚Äôs allegations satisfied Morrison‚Äôs transactional test, regardless of whether the ‚Äúconduct and effects‚Äù test might apply.
The Tenth Circuit‚Äôs decision will not affect private securities actions, because the Dodd-Frank amendments apply only to governmental proceedings. And even as to governmental proceedings, the decision‚Äôs practical impact might not be too great. As the District Court‚Äôs ruling and the Tenth Circuit concurrence illustrate, the Government might be able to satisfy Morrison‚Äôs transactional test without having to invoke Dodd-Frank‚Äôs ‚Äúconduct and effects‚Äù standard.
Nevertheless, one can imagine situations where the availability of a ‚Äúconduct and effects‚Äù analysis might be important to the Government‚Äôs ability to plead a violation of the securities laws. The Scoville case now sanctions that alternative approach.march 7

After 56 hours we are nearly there. The main player is the lorry, in Cream and Brown with varnished deck, all properly lined out in the tradition that goes back to Farm Carts and Stage Coaches of the 1800s. The gentle Cream and Brown are "broken" colours - Cream is a tint of Yellow, Brown is a shade of Orange. So other broken colours are used for the background to show off the waggon - so no strong bright Red or Orange to detract. To get the look you must get the reflectance levels right. Surfaces reflect light differently. Metal cab, wooden deck, glass, chrome, rubber, and so on. It is still life painting really. It's all an illusion. There's no actual lorry there - just colours, shapes and lines. My idea is to put it all together to be easy to look at, but not too easy. Simple without being boring. Interesting without being confusing -

Reimagine a kitchen that is completely, effortlessly you: A dream kitchen handcrafted using high quality wood from local lumber mills. Amish Kitchen Gallery has made this fantasy a reality.
For 13 years, Amish Kitchen Gallery (AKG) founder Ryan McKeever has united custom hand-built Amish cabinetry, award-winning designers, and beautiful kiln-dried wood varieties to craft unique furniture pieces for the room at the heart of any home: the kitchen. ‚ÄúYou are only as good as the team around you. We have the best designers and installers in the business who work with our exclusive Amish builders to infuse our furniture with that old-world craftsmanship and quality.‚Äù
From craftsman and lumber sources to customers to its exceptional installation team and designers, local families are at the center of everything AKG does. Company Manager & Lead Designer Brittany Lips agrees. ‚ÄúAfter I came to work for Amish Kitchen Gallery almost 8 years ago, I had my first daughter. They made it possible for me to work on a flexible schedule. Now, with two daughters, I appreciate how family-oriented we are even more.‚Äù AKG is proud to support area families‚Äîwhich also results in a low environmental impact‚Äîthroughout its entire process.
Completely customer-oriented, AKG provides a full-service experience, including remodel inspiration, concept development and design, space solutions, photorealistic renderings, material sourcing, and expert installation. Customers browse a wide variety of finishes and styles, customizing details to suit space, function, and taste. The result is a breathtaking balance of function and beauty.
A recent kitchen remodel has truly captured this vision, featuring several different angles, exquisitely curved cabinets, brass details, molding, and custom builds reminiscent of found pieces. The unusual kitchen space‚Äîwhich included a removed wall and evolution from formal dining room to eat-in kitchen‚Äîmade the project uniquely challenging. ‚ÄúThis was a great project that definitely pushed the clients‚Äô vision outside of the box!‚Äù
The husband had grown up in this home, so the couple wanted to hold true to some of its traditional elements such as brickwork. At the same time, they wanted to modernize the look and make it their own. The flooring we selected was for the entire first floor, so it was important to make sure our design worked well with it. Our approach, as always, was holistic, considering and coordinating everything: tilework, backsplash, fixtures, and cabinets, the foundation from which everything is built.
Founder Ryan McKeever and Company Manager Brittany Lips share some of the standout features in their latest kitchen remodel!
One of my favorite pieces just has to be the tall side-by-side pantry cabinets! The pantry rollouts close behind elegantly curved doors with the curved face frames, accented with antique style cremone bolts.
. . .
The sink base is made out of wood to look like a found furniture piece! Using an apron front farm sink on a base with curved legs, we chose a stained hickory cabinet with a matte black finish for the sink and hardware, because black will always be timeless.
. . .
The bar area was quite the highlight with its island and many cabinets! We created an entire bar space, complete with custom pullouts, a drink preparation area, bar sink, beverage fridge, liquor bottle pullouts, tongue and groove upper cabinets with back detailing, a bookcase, and coffee bar area. We questioned everything, always pushing a step further.
. . .
We did not want to use solid door panels near the stove, so we incorporated brass mesh. This instantly lifted the cabinets. Features like cabinets and countertops will last for years, so it is important to add visual interest.
. . .
Contractors unexpectedly found a wall that needed to remain, so we customized around it. You cannot even tell it is there! Our installers, Matt and Corey, are fantastic problem solvers, and much would not be possible without them. We highly recommend allowing us to install our custom pieces to ensure they are handled with the necessary finesse and attention to detail.

According to a company spokesman, Indezit International has filed several lawsuits against the inspectors of Lipetsk department of the Custom Service over the inspectors' decision to increase customs duty on the import of isocyanate Suprasec 5005. The company uses this product as one of the components for the production of rigid polyurethane foam for thermal insulation.
According to Indezit executives, the custom duty for this production should be set at 5 percent. This rate was set initially after the independent classification of goods on the basis of examination by the Scientific Research Institute of Polymers in Russia.
However, representatives of Lipetsk customs say that according to studies conducted in the central customs office, these types of products belong to a different group of goods that should be the subject of 10 percent custom duty.
This precedent isn't unique for the Russian polyurethane market. Indezit International participated in legal proceedings with Lipetsk Customs Office in 2009. The company won that dispute. Other companies that use isocyanates have reported similar problems.
According to Indezit, the quantity of the isocyanate produced across Russia doesn't meet demand, which makes import it necessary.All of our instructors are EMTs or Paramedics, and we strive to have a radio of 1 manikin to every 2 students, to ensure all students have as much hands-on practice as possible.

Submitted.With the obesity rates approaching nearly half the adult population, politicians and health advisers are scrambling to figure out a solution. Meanwhile, economists are focused on how much obesity is going to cost future generations.
While the health effects of obesity are well documented, the economic and social effects are just coming into play, a new report published by Campaign to End Obesity says. The national cost of obesity is now estimated at $190 billion, or $607.77 per person.
Cities are redesigning seats on public transportation to accommodate larger passengers, and companies are creating wellness incentive programs for employees. But all this societal evolution doesn‚Äôt come cheap. (You can start helping everybody out by watching what you eat. Check out these Lean Belly Restaurant Rules.)
We're using more gas‚Äîover 39 million gallons per year for every additional pound to the average weight. We‚Äôre also driving bigger cars‚Äîbetween 1960 and 2002, an additional 1 billion gallons of gas per year is a direct result of passenger weight gain, according to Consumer Reports. Plus, wellness programs can cost up to $50,000 to implement.
Here‚Äôs a look at the enormity and the effects of our growing obesity rate.

They are among the most difficult rooms to design and decorate. Sure, you can opt into the classic solution‚Ä¶COZY. But what does that really mean? Cramp the space and fill it with quaintness that ultimately ends up looking like clutter. If it‚Äôs a room meant for relaxation, that‚Äôs not the worst solution. But very few people have the luxury of a home large enough to dedicate one whole room to simply ‚Äòbeing.‚Äô We need spaces that function! To that end, we hope you enjoy this six part series about how to bring a tiny bedroom to life.
CORNERS
Easily one of the most under used parts of a room, so don‚Äôt leave them bare. Fill the space with function and form, but avoid using them for large furniture. Such as, putting a dresser in a corner with one side pressed to the wall. The right angles might fit well, but from a visual perspective it‚Äôs akin to creating a dead end. Instead, create a space. Think about ways to make a specific use for the corner.
Our suggestion is to tuck a chair in the corner so it‚Äôs an area in the room that can be enjoyed. Opt for a chair that has some space underneath. It will double as a bit of extra storage if you use a simple basket. Next, use the vertical space of the walls on either side of the chair. On one side you could mount a full length mirror. Everyone can use one, and it will also serve to make the room look bigger. On the other side, mount several shelves for storing and displaying items. Hang the bottom shelf low enough to function as a side table for the chair. Set a lamp on it for reading, and a few coasters for drinks to be set on.
If you don‚Äôt have enough floor space to place a chair in the corner, purchase multiple floating shelves that are L-shaped. They tuck in the corner at the perfect right angle without creating a dead end. From a visual perspective, the eye will naturally scan from one side of the shelf to the other. This creates a sense of continuity. Using L-shaped shelves also gives the space a built-in feel that makes the room seem more substantial.

Recent CommentsWe don't want babies named 'Valentine' or 'Mistakes Happen' in nine months, says KZN health MEC
MEC Nomagugu Simelane urged young people to be safe this Valentine's Day
KwaZulu-Natal health MEC Nomagugu Simelane on Sunday urged young ‚Äúamorous couples‚Äù to practise safe sex to avoid regrets ‚Äî which included scrambling for morning-after pills and contracting a sexually transmitted disease.
The MEC was using Valentine's Day to appeal to young men and women to protect themselves when engaging in sexual activity.
‚ÄúSo, we are saying to our people, in enjoying this day, do not get carried away. Let us be responsible, and not find ourselves with babies called Valentine‚Äôs and Phutha Liyenzeka (Mistakes Happen) by November.
‚ÄúGovernment has given us all the options to protect ourselves. There are pills, injections, implants and condoms that are meant to help us prevent an unplanned pregnancy and unwanted babies. Let‚Äôs enjoy ourselves without any regrets,‚Äù she said.
According to a Stats SA report titled Unwanted Fertility in South Africa, about 20% of pregnancies in the five years preceding the 2016 Demographic and Health Survey (including pregnancies at the time), happened when women were not planning on having children.
The report stated that the percentage of unwanted births increased from 17.3% in 1998 to 20.4% in 2016.
‚ÄúFurthermore, in a summary of a research project published in the SA Medical Journal ... academic scholars point out that unplanned pregnancies among youth pose a serious public health concern.
‚ÄúThey expose young women and their newborns to potential adverse health and social outcomes, including the likelihood of unsafe abortions, maternal depression and anxiety, premature birth and low birth weight,‚Äù said Simelane.
She said unplanned pregnancies were ‚Äúsocially disruptive and impact negatively on educational progress and future career prospects‚Äù.
‚ÄúWomen with unintended pregnancies are likely to be less well educated and poorer than women without such pregnancies. Unplanned pregnancy occurs mainly as a result of contraceptive failure and inconsistent or non-use of contraceptives, including inconsistent use of condoms.
‚ÄúA number of factors have been associated with unplanned or unintended pregnancies among youth. These include socio-economic, demographic and behavioural factors such as poor socio-economic status, age, living arrangements, peer pressure, sexual coercion, sex socialisation, unprotected sex, ignorance, and negative attitudes towards contraception.‚Äù
She urged those old enough to be sexually active to ‚Äútake care of themselves‚Äù.
‚ÄúThey must use protection. Men must use condoms, because they are available free of charge. The advantage now is also the fact that there are female condoms, which a woman has a right to put on if her partner does not want to use a male condom,‚Äù she said.

First, there are the adorable llamas and alpacas roaming the grounds. Then there are the accommodations themselves: your choice of a colorful stunner of a luxury cottage or a tree house.
And the setting for this already-amazing scene is a bamboo forest ‚Äî not off on some faraway tropical island, but in the middle of Atlanta, of all places.
What‚Äôs more, the alpacas and llamas are rescues, and the tree house was built from reclaimed materials. It sounds like one heck of a retreat!
I mean, come on, can you imagine waking up in the morning and seeing Figgy the llama out your window?
Well, hold on. If you opt for the tree house, you‚Äôre not going to catch that view of a friendly critter right out your window, because it sits high above the forest floor on stilts.
The tree house has become a huge success on Airbnb, with people renting it not just for overnight stays but weddings and other events.
But Kara O‚ÄôBrien, the owner of this little corner of paradise, didn‚Äôt get a lot of support for her plan at the outset. ‚ÄúEveryone said it was a terrible idea,‚Äù she told the Atlanta Journal-Constitution. ‚ÄúBut I‚Äôm not one to really listen to other people.‚Äù
The tree house is currently going for $375 per night on Airbnb, and the cottage is $134 a night. O‚ÄôBrien also offers a ‚ÄúLlama Alpaca Experience‚Äù on Airbnb so visitors can meet the animals even if they‚Äôre not staying in the cottage or tree house.
Since it‚Äôs made from reclaimed materials, the tree house has some interesting details. For example, the main entry door came from a 120-year-old house in Atlanta that once belonged to the mayor:
The cottage is really charming, too.
It‚Äôs not among the bamboo, but it‚Äôs on the farm, so you‚Äôre adjacent to all of the llama and alpaca action:
In a video the Atlanta Journal-Constitution shared about the Airbnb units, O‚ÄôBrien talks about how the tree house has brought people together in surprising ways.
‚ÄúWe‚Äôve had proposals and weddings ‚Äî it seems like it‚Äôs a place where people have come together, and celebrate each other and are really happy, and that was something we didn‚Äôt expect when we started it.‚Äù
The llamas and alpacas are in the video, too, so you should definitely watch:
O‚ÄôBrien notes in the video that the bamboo forest‚Äôs origins are a bit of a mystery, but people think it‚Äôs been there since the 1940s.
Really, a hint of mystery just adds to the allure of this place.
That and baby llamas.
One of O‚ÄôBrien‚Äôs Instagram captions sums it up. ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs a llama in my bamboo forest.‚Äù
Who wouldn‚Äôt want to stay here?
Time to pack your bags for Atlanta, my friends.

On view at the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art (SFMOMA) from November 8, 2008, through February 8, 2009, The Art of Participation: 1950 to Now presents an overview of the rich and varied history of participatory art practice during the past six decades, exploring strategies and situations in which the public has taken a collaborative role in the art-making process.
Organized by SFMOMA Curator of Media Arts Rudolf Frieling, this large thematic presentation gathers more than 70 works by some 50 individual artists and collectives, and will feature projects both on-site and online, as well as several new pieces commissioned specifically for the exhibition. From early performance-based and conceptual art to online works rooted in the multiuser dynamics of Web 2.0 platforms, The Art of Participation reflects on the confluence of audience interaction, utopian politics, and mass media, and reclaims the museum as a space for two-way exchange between artists and viewers.
The exhibition proposes that participatory art is generally based on a notion of indeterminacy‚Äîan openness to chance or change, as introduced by John Cage in the early 1950s‚Äîand refers to projects that, while initiated by individual artists, can be realized only through the contribution of others. This artistic approach entices the public to join in; questions the conventional divide between artists and their audience; and challenges assumptions about the symbolic value of art, as well as the traditional role of the museum as a container for objects rather than a site for social engagement or art production. Participatory art typically synthesizes a variety of artistic media, emphasizes process over object, and champions the idea of collective authorship.
The Art of Participation traces the influence and transformation of this concept across various genres, identifying its signal moments and charting a lineage of participatory art across a wide spectrum of media, including drawing, painting, sculpture, performance, film, video, photography, online projects, and interactive media installations. Seminal works by major historical figures such as Joseph Beuys, John Cage, Lygia Clark, Hans Haacke, Dan Graham, and Nam June Paik, will contextualize more recent projects by Francis Al√øs, Maria Eichhorn, Jochen Gerz, Felix Gonzalez-Torres, Lynn Hershman Leeson, and Erwin Wurm, among others, linking key aspects of contemporary participatory practice to their historical precedents.
‚ÄúFor decades, artists have played a major part in anticipating the social implications of the ongoing revolution in communications media, critically studying forms of interactivity, exchange, and participation that are increasingly commonplace,‚Äù states Frieling. ‚ÄúAs emblems of the Internet mindset‚Äîbrowsing, sharing, collecting, producing‚Äîbegin to infuse all areas of society, this timely project establishes a big-picture narrative that connects significant points in art history to widespread conditions of contemporary life, and considers the important role that new-media art, in particular, has played in shaping contemporary art as a whole.‚Äù
The Art of Participation will be presented thematically, highlighting significant groupings around common threads: indeterminacy, conceptualism, performance, location, authority, public dialogue, utopian ideals, and social sculpture, among others. In assessing participation‚Äôs impact on contemporary art, the exhibition will also touch upon its limits and pitfalls, such as the implications that arise when viewers are puzzled or simply refuse to participate.
Representing a pivotal moment in the historical beginnings of participatory art, John Cage‚Äôs score entitled 4‚Äô33‚Äù (1952) offers notation for a musical composition of complete silence, to be played for the duration of four minutes and 33 seconds. Without instrumentation, the score‚Äîperformed daily in the gallery‚Äîhighlights ambient sounds in the physical environment and those made by the audience. Another early work, Hans Haacke‚Äôs News (1969/2008), features a printer connected to a live newsfeed that, in light of today‚Äôs ubiquitous news access, somewhat anachronistically spews heaps of paper onto the floor as the stories pour in; visitors are welcome to pick up portions to read. Growing as a sculpture over time, the work brings the news and by extension the larger world into the gallery, a space normally reserved for the ‚Äúreading‚Äù of art. Other key historical works include Allan Kaprow‚Äôs Hello, an excerpt from The Medium Is the Medium (1969); Nam June Paik‚Äôs Participation TV (1963/1998); and several important Fluxus works, including George Brecht‚Äôs Water Yam (1963), a boxed collection of various cards, documents, and instructions.
Works that address conceptualism and co-authorship include a selection of performative sculptures, among them Erwin Wurm‚Äôs One Minute Sculptures (2007/2008), which present a number of ordinary items‚Äîa refrigerator, plastic bottles, tennis balls‚Äîarranged in the gallery. While the display might suggest the idea of traditional sculpture, the objects are only virtual sculptures embodied in corresponding instructional drawings, provided so that the viewer may use them to enact a series of short poses and scenarios. Felix Gonzalez-Torres‚Äôs ‚ÄúUntitled‚Äù (1992/1993), comprises mass-produced prints for viewers to pick up and take home. By offering these giveaways without dictating what is to be done with them, the artist has enabled a future life for his artwork beyond the gallery, questioning the uniqueness of the art object and rethinking the museum as a place of production and distribution. Additional works related to this theme include Tom Marioni‚Äôs The Act of Drinking Beer with Friends Is the Highest Form of Art (1970‚Äì2008), a site-specific installation with a functioning bar; Dan Graham‚Äôs Schema of a Set of Pages (1966), a schematic poem meant to generate further texts; and Stephen Willats‚Äôs A Moment of Action (1974), which asks viewers to complete a questionnaire about a series of photographs.
Joseph Beuys‚Äôs concept of social sculpture‚Äîone of his chief theories regarding the cultural and political functions of art‚Äîis based on a belief in the artistic potential of every member of society and art‚Äôs ability to bring about revolutionary change. In a compelling nine-minute speech that was part of a live international satellite telecast from Documenta 6 in 1977, the artist expounds on his utopian theory that art ‚Äúwould no longer refer exclusively to the specialists within the modern art world, but extend to the whole work of humanity.‚Äù A more recent take on political conditions that frame participation is Francis Al√øs‚Äôs street action in Mexico City entitled Re-enactments (2001), which records on video the artist‚Äôs self-imposed directive to ‚Äúwalk as far as you can while holding a 9mm Beretta in your right hand‚Äù until the inevitable dramatic conclusion‚Äîhis arrest‚Äîfifteen minutes later. After the initial filming, Al√øs convinced police officers to allow him to repeat the action, including the arrest and interactions of passersby, as a staged performance for the camera. The resulting work projects both the original documentation and the reenactment. Other performance documents of encounters between artist and public include Abramoviƒá/Ulay‚Äôs Imponderabilia (1977), staged in a museum setting, and VALIE EXPORT‚Äôs TAPP- und TASTKINO (TAP and TOUCH CINEMA) (1968), staged outside the institution. Gallery visitors can also physically experience a number of sensorial works by Lygia Clark, including Di√°logo: √ìculos (Dialogue: Goggles) (1968/2008).
The idea of participation in art today, however, is perhaps most radically conceived as an invitation to the viewer to not only contribute to but actually create the work, emphasizing artmaking as public dialogue. Marking its U.S. debut, Rafael Lozano-Hemmer‚Äôs interactive sound installation Microphones (2008), records visitors‚Äô speech into standing microphones and plays back previous recordings, building an archive of utterances over the course of the exhibition. Another highlight, Jochen Gerz‚Äôs The Gift (2000/2008), creates a fully functioning photo lab in the gallery, inviting Bay Area denizens to have a portrait taken in the museum. In exchange, each participant is given a framed portrait of someone else at the end of the exhibition, and then asked to submit documentation of the work on display in his or her own home. 1st Public White Cube (2001/2008), by Blank & Jeron and Gerrit Gohlke, takes place both online and on-site in a series of eBay auctions. Participants will bid not for ownership of the works on display (created by guest artists selected by Blank & Jeron), but for the right to alter and reinstall them according to their own proposal.
The exhibition also includes a selection of pieces that redefine notions of location and site-specificity, among them Ant Farm Media Van v.08 (Time Capsule) (2008), an SFMOMA commission for the exhibition that re-imagines a landmark project by members of the groundbreaking San Francisco-based collective known as Ant Farm. Hole-in-Space (1980/2008), a large-scale video installation by Kit Galloway and Sherrie Rabinowitz, presents here for the first time complete original footage from the artists‚Äô live telecommunication event in 1980, which used satellite technology to connect street pedestrians in Los Angeles with their counterparts in New York, allowing them to suddenly see and speak to each other in real time. Another highlight is Lynn Hershman Leeson‚Äôs Life¬≤ (2006-present), which revisits the artist‚Äôs public installation The Dante Hotel (1973‚Äì74). Originally presented in a real hotel room in San Francisco, it is now reconfigured as an experiential archive in the virtual world of Second Life, where visitors will be able to convene and interact in real time.
Perhaps most importantly, The Art of Participation, as a reflection of our contemporary media society, will change form and content as more and more visitors contribute‚Äîon-site and online‚Äîand in so doing, it will explore the role of active engagement between artists, the public, and the museum. In recent years SFMOMA has built a reputation as a pioneer in exploring how new technologies transform contemporary culture with exhibitions such as Public Information (1995) and 010101: Art in Technological Times (2001). The Art of Participation furthers this field of study, in part by addressing the impact of technological culture on how a museum defines its notion of public engagement.
According to Frieling, ‚ÄúSan Francisco is perhaps one of the most fitting places in the world to present an up-to-the-minute geneaology of participation-based art because of its legacy of experimental art forms of the 1960s and, more recently, its proximity to Silicon Valley. Technological innovation has always changed art‚Äînot only by providing artists with new tools, but also by provoking critical analysis or resistance to technology‚Äôs utopian promise.‚Äù
SFMOMA, in association with Thames & Hudson, will publish a 224-page, fully illustrated exhibition catalogue featuring original essays by Robert Atkins, Rudolf Frieling, Boris Groys, and Lev Manovich. Available at the SFMOMA MuseumStore and bookstores worldwide in November 2008, the publication introduces work by all of the artists in the exhibition, with reproductions of significant projects by other major figures‚Äîfrom H√©lio Oiticica, Joan Jonas, and Gordon Matta-Clark to Komar & Melamid and Gabriel Orozco‚Äîrounding out the overview. SFMOMA will also produce a companion volume‚Äîa small print-on-demand paperback, to be released after the exhibition closes‚Äîreflecting the participatory aspects of the show by collecting texts, visuals, and other content contributed by artists and visitors..
The Art of Participation: 1950 to Now is organized by the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art. The exhibition is generously funded by the James Irvine Foundation.Although stealing bases, and even signs, in baseball may be part of the game, stealing another team‚Äôs trade secrets can land you in federal prison, as one executive recently learned the hard way.
As we previously reported, the FBI has been investigating the St. Louis Cardinals for hacking into the Houston Astros‚Äô internal computer network and stealing proprietary information, including internal discussions about trades, proprietary statistics, and scouting reports. The investigation has now concluded, the Cardinals‚Äô former director of baseball development, Chris Correa, pleaded guilty to five counts of unauthorized access of a protected computer in January, and he has now been sentenced to 46 months in federal prison. He also must pay $279,038 in restitution. According to NPR, ‚ÄúU.S. District Judge Lynn Hughes, as she sentenced Correa, noted that the crime has resulted in stricter security at other baseball teams, according to a press release from the Justice Department. When Correa apologized and called his actions ‚Äòreckless,‚Äô [Judge] Hughes replied, ‚ÄòNo, you intentionally and knowingly did these acts.‚Äô‚Äù
As the Department of Justice reported at the time of Correa‚Äôs plea:.

Even after all the scientific discoveries and developments, there are important decisions to be made by parents and politicians.
In the UK, government policy on whether to fund new vaccines, or modify their availability, is based on advice from an independent scientific advisory group. This involves weighing up the benefits and costs, and then deciding whether a vaccine is value for money.
The idea is to find a balance between the cost of doing something (such as routinely vaccinating all children against a particular disease) and how much benefit you get from doing it (such as health gains by preventing disease and the associated economic savings).
Yet the current approach does not take into account many of the benefits that vaccinations offer and which set them apart.
Vaccination factors
Previous research suggests that parents make decisions about childhood vaccinations according to a mixture of social and personal factors. Social factors include societal norms and moral beliefs. Personal factors include perceived effectiveness, the risk of infection, side effects, and ease of access.
The peace of mind‚Äîa sense of wellbeing and reassurance‚Äîthat comes from getting a child vaccinated could be another important personal factor. But little research has been done in this area, so the potential benefit is not currently considered by decision makers.
Our research investigated ‚Äúvaccine associated peace of mind‚Äù by discussing the topic with members of the public to see whether it was a factor in their experiences of vaccination..
Participants in one focus group said that the longer a vaccine had been available, the safer it felt to them. They spoke of being reassured by knowing a vaccination had been used for many years.
There were some exceptions. For example, although the MenB vaccine (given to offer protection from life-threatening infections including meningitis and blood poisoning caused by meningococcal group B bacteria) was considered relatively ‚Äúnew‚Äù by many participants (it was introduced in 2015), it brought increased peace of mind because of the severity of the diseases it prevented.
Parental concerns.
Also, certain vaccines offered less peace of mind if a parent had only experienced a mild form of the disease as a child, or had no personal experience at all.
Many of the parents we spoke to said that making vaccination decisions was a complex process, with each person choosing to vaccinate (or not) by balancing their beliefs about the benefits versus the potential risks. Some mentioned feelings of anxiety about making the wrong decision.
For most, the amount of peace of mind they reported was linked to their opinions about the severity of a disease and possible susceptibility. But concerns about vaccine-associated side effects were also found to reduce peace of mind.

Telangana IRS officer Durishetty Anudeep tops Civil Services 2017 exam

A BITS Pilani engineer in Rajashtan in 2011, received his education from Suryodaya High School in Metpally. Anudeep‚Äôs father is an Assistant Engineer of TS Transco, while his mother is a housewife. The optional subject of the topper was anthropology, although he is an engineer.
Speaking to The Hindu, Anudeep said he did not expect the first rank. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs a tough test and a lot of deserving candidates with a brilliant mindset, so you can never expect a high ranking,‚Äù he said in all humility. Anudeep prepared without assistance from any training institution. Meanwhile, R.C. Reddy IAS Study Circle said that it appeared for a simulated interview at its center.
A sports fan, Anudeep has an obsession with Roger Federer and Lionel Messi. In one of his publications on Facebook, he praised Messi, saying that the game of football is not really beautiful, it is brutal, but Messi has an artistic and symphonic beauty in his game that makes the brutal aspect beautiful.
In expressing his love for sports, he published: ‚ÄúThen I asked myself what I value most: sports, movies, books or music.‚Äù The movies are good, the books are great and the music is relaxing. But my life would not be half as happy or interesting if it were not for the time I spend watching and practicing sports. ‚Äù
Several Telugu students scored well on the test. Sai Praneeth, son of the former General Director of Maharashtra, V. Lakshminarayana, obtained the 196th rank. Other successful Telugu candidates are Sheelam Sai (43), Narapureddy Maurya (100), G. Madhuri (144), Yedavalli Akshay Kumar (624), Vivek Jhonson (195) and Bhargav Shekar (816).
PTI adds
The commission recommended a total of 990 candidates, 750 men, and 240 women, to be appointed to various central government services, according to a government statement.
Anu Kumari and Sachin Gupta obtained the second and third place respectively in the coveted exam‚Ä¶

It helps to plan your next morning in advance just before you go to sleep, visualise yourself waking up at 5 am.Set alarm at 5 am,place the alarm across the room.Trick your brain to believe that the challenge is just to reach to the tooth brush, because once you reach your brush you wouldn't go back to bed.try this you would be surprised at how much you can accomplish before the world wakes up.
2. Drink at least 2 glasses of water -Our body is 60% water .It helps to maintain all the metabolic processes at an optimal level.
3. Exercise for 20 min -Exercise not only helps you to be fit but also releases endorphins which are responsible to keep your mind happy. You can choose any kind of exercise like walking , jogging, weights, strength training or yoga.It is good to have a mixture of cardio and strength training. Make it very easy for your brain to develop the habit by breaking it into chunks.keep your work out clothes and shoes ready the previous night next to your bed. Challenge to your brain is not to go to the gym but only to get into workout clothes. Once you get into it, the chain of habit loop would automatically take you out to the gym or on your yoga mat with much less effort.
4. Meditate- I call it magic. If you practice it daily for 20 min it helps you go through the day feeling like everything is under your control. It helps you to develop more will power, will power is like a muscle more you practice more you develop .It helps you to catch and pause a moment before you respond to any situation, to become a better parent and patient one. In today's world of distraction, learning to concentrate is the most important skill that you can develop.
5. Read a good book for 20 min or your career related topic. It helps you move up in your career and stay one step ahead of others.Widens your horizons of the world view. Even if you implement 1 or 2 things from each book in your life, it is worth the effort.
6. Maintain a daily journal-Visualise your highest self and write it down.Plan your day in advance by writing down the tasks, divide it into goals and obligations.Helps you go through your day without stress.
7. Drink a glass of healthy smoothie-Include green leafy vegetables avocado ,banana, almonds, bitter gourd ,chia seeds.Many healthy recipes are available online to make them tasty and nutritious too filled with antioxidants and vitamins.
It takes a lot of effort to create a healthy morning routine and perfect it. But once you create a habit. It becomes automatic and effortless. Consistency is very important. We are what we do, over and over again.The Indicator NPR hide caption

.
The improvement suggests that there might be bigger gains to come if COVID-19 cases keep falling, people get vaccinated and the economy can reopen. That said, context is important. More than 379,000 jobs created may sound good, but actually that means there are still about 9.5 million fewer jobs than before the pandemic was declared.
There's a lot more in the report; it's super detailed. And as we often do on Jobs Friday, we have asked three of our old faves ‚Äî labor market experts ‚Äî to pick out an indicator from the report that they think is especially worth highlighting.

April 28, Team On Belay will strike out and brave the sun and the sea to get 100 kids to an On Belay program this year. While our programs are always free to our families, it‚Äôs not free of cost. Each On Belay program costs around $3000. We are running six this year. That means we need around $18000 to make these programs possible. Team On Belay has a goal of $10,000. Click here to help them achieve it!
[button_link url=‚Äù‚Äù target=‚Äù‚Äù style=‚Äù‚Äù title=‚Äù‚Äù class=‚Äù‚Äù id=‚Äù‚Äù onclick=‚Äù‚Äù]Team On Belay[/button_link]EITC
The Mesivta of Greater Philadelphia is committed to ensuring finances are not a barrier to a Jewish education for our students. We provide scholarship assistance to nearly 41% of our PA residents, much of which is funded through the Educational Improvement Tax Credit program (EITC).
Many of The Mesivta families are in need of financial assistance in any given year. Even more so at this time, the pandemic and its aftermath have taken a financial toll on many and the need for scholarships has expanded significantly. To meet this need, we need your help.
Please consider participating in the EITC program and designating your contribution for The Mesivta. Besides the incalculable benefits of supporting our students, you will receive:
A 90% tax credit for your contribution
The possibility of a charitable deduction for the remaining 10%
Participants must have a minimum of $6,200 in PA tax liability and may give up to a maximum of such liability.
How does the math work? If you contribute $10,000, The Mesivta receives $10,000. You will receive a tax credit for $9,000 and may also be able to claim the remaining $1,000 as a charitable contribution. This is an incredible way to leverage your donation!
If you are interested in joining, please contact Ronit Snitman at rsnitman@themesivta.org.
Thank you for your continued support of our students!Volvo assist ‚Äì a comprehensive roadside assistance package and even a 30 day exchange promise to guarantee your satisfaction.

This will obviously be very reliant on RNG and hoping you get good drops wherever you're looting. Also be sure to check the loot on players you killed as it's more common to take a suppressor from a fresh kill who might have had one. After a 2019 update SMG / Pistol suppressors are now the same thing and compatible with each other. Meaning a pistol suppressor can be attached to an SMG and an SMG suppressor can be attached to a pistol. The best two maps to go for this achievement would be Sanhok and Vikindi as they're both packed with loot. EDIT: Thanks to AZT Sidewinder for confirming the VSS counts as a suppressed weapon.EDIT: Thanks to Bricki for confirming the Crossbow counts as a suppressed weapon. Did you do it on the Sanhok map? I've heard a lot of people are having trouble getting achievements to pop on that map.I had an SKS, Scar, and the P18C when it popped for me. I was also on Miramar.Posted by Reborn Insanity on 04 Sep 18 at 14:13 Got this to work with silenced pistol. Silence ump. Along with crossbow.Posted by Bricki on 04 Sep 18 at 18:24 Thanks! Updated.Posted by Reborn Insanity on 04 Sep 18 at 19:09 The crossbow apparently counts as a silent weaponPosted by Straight Blazen on 04 Sep 18 at 21:09 Yeah, It's already in the solution. Thank you!Posted by Reborn Insanity on 04 Sep 18 at 21:12 I unlocked the Achievement, but didn‚Äôt receive any GS.Posted by Chester Cheevo on 04 Sep 18 at 23:54 Just did this on Sanhok and no achievementPosted by AM Stang on 05 Sep 18 at 03:25 Thanks Stang for confirming my suspicions. I've added a warning to the solution.Posted by Reborn Insanity on 05 Sep 18 at 03:39 i don't know if it's a sanhok thing i just got all three on erangel and it didn't unlockPosted by FatalTortoise on 05 Sep 18 at 06:58 This could be easier to do with friends in Duos/Squads. The more people you have looking for suppressors, the higher your chance of finding the parts you need. I had a suppressor for my sniper and pistol and my duo partner had a suppressor for his AR, so I asked him to give it to me so I can put it on my gun and once I did, I got the achievement. I then dropped all three of my guns so he could pick them all up and he got the achievement as well.Posted by VictimOfDesire on 05 Sep 18 at 14:31 I got this with a VSS, Crossbow and silenced Pistol (loot RNG was not being kind..)Posted by AZT Sidewinder on 07 Sep 18 at 12:22 Thanks, I've updated the solution.Posted by Reborn Insanity on 07 Sep 18 at 13:20 Thank you for the information!Posted by MeowyMeowerson on 07 Sep 18 at 15:14 I received this achievement after switching my suppressor from my scar to my SKS whilst having a suppressed pistol.TLDR it popped having only 2 suppressorPosted by FearedNightmare on 08 Sep 18 at 22:51 Think this achievement is bugged. Done this in three games now and it still hasn't popped. One was with a VSS and an UMP, one with a QBU and a QBZ, last one with a M416 and an UMP. Think the pistol in all three was the 9mm single fire one, p95 is it?Edit: It did actually pop on one of those occasions. Just not pop up on the screen. It unlocked silently.Posted by Skeeter Quill on 10 Sep 18 at 12:51 I just unlocked this on Sanhok with 2 suppressed UMPs and a pistol (1911, I think).

The land that is south of Altcar Road in Formby, owned by Hugh McAuley, which was hoped to be turned into a spectacular ¬£5m sports facility for Formby, has now been knocked out of the Local Plan by the Inspector.
The sports facility is there solely for the benefit of the community so it is very sad that this has happened. Over 1,200 residents wrote in to Sefton Council, in favour of the plan last year. The land was the ONLY site to be left out of Sefton Council‚Äôs Local Plan at the hearing in March 2015, but, two weeks later, the good news emerged that the planning Inspectorate decided to reconsider the proposal. It is that proposal that has just been heard at the planning meeting and the decision was for it to be removed from the Plan altogether.
A representative of Hugh McAuley said: ‚ÄúThe owners of the land are now speaking with Sefton Council regarding a planning application outside of the Local Plan.‚Äù
It is well known that Hugh McAuley, working with St Modwen, had been looking to develop this site, with the primary focus being to build a 5 million pound sports facility on the old site of Formby FC. Hugh Mr McAuley is the owner of Formby Play Sports Ltd which at the moment runs a football facility from the land and which has 4 3G astroturf pitches, plus the old Formby FC pitch is used to host games for numerous teams, including Frank Rourke‚Äôs Formby Junior Sports Club. Up until recently Hugh McAuley had solely funded this venture, however, to move the sports facility up to the next level in terms of quality and range of facilities he took the decision to team up with one the Uk‚Äôs leading developers, St. Modwen Plc.
Hugh McAuley purchased the site back in 2010 and has since worked hard to push the site forward in the hope its full and obvious potential could be unlocked. Back in 2010 Formby‚Äôs local football team, ‚ÄòThe Squirrels,‚Äô played from at the Altcar Road site. However, in 2013 the pitches failed the ground grading and Formby FC were disappointedly forced to up sticks and move to Burscough. Since then the club has ceased to exist. This is another driver behind Hugh McAuley‚Äôs attempts to develop the sports scheme as it provides the potential to bring the ‚ÄòSquirrels‚Äô back to their historic and rightful home!!
Up to now Formby Play Sports Ltd and its related facility is very much associated with football. However, this would be the tip of the iceberg as it was proposed that once the proposed sports development is completed it would provide:
2 x 11 aside 3G astroturf pitches
4 x 6 aside indoor pitches and 1 futsal pitch
there will facilities to play
rugby
netball
volleyball
short tennis
badminton
trampolining and free running
skate & scooter park
soft play centre
A sensory room
dance and aerobic studio
boxing and martial arts area
fitness and personal training suite
Sports club house
Sefton Council‚Äôs Local Plan only comes around once every 15 years, and the plan put forward a number of sites and development area in the Borough for both residential and employment development.
Will Martin, planning manager for St. Mowden ‚Äì North West, said:
‚ÄúWe‚Äôd like to thank all the members of the local community who have expressed their support for this development. As evidenced by the comments, the scheme has many benefits; economic benefits and employment and job creation; football club facilities; sports and leisure facilities with young people stating that the scheme will benefit all ages of the community and we could not agree more.‚Äù
Lets hope that Hugh manages to succeed with this venture and hopefully with so many members of the public behind him, in the end it will go ahead.

Ltd. plans to build a factory in Thailand, its second outside Japan, to grow sales in Southeast and western Asia and cut its manufacturing costs.
The $8.8 million facility is expected to open in March and will produce 180 machines a year initially. The company plans to increase production to 360 presses a year there within three years, it said in a June 12 announcement.
The factory will be located in Rayon Province, in the Eastern Seaboard Industrial Estate, an area dense with investment from the global auto industry, including General Motors, Mazda and Ford, and more than 100 Japanese, European and U.S. auto parts factories, Nissei said.
‚ÄúIt is often called the ‚ÄòDetroit of Asia,' ‚Äù Nissei said.
The industrial estate, which is about 75 miles from Bangkok, hosts more than 230 companies, including electronics manufacturers and metal-processing firms.
The Rayon plant will make midsize, general-purpose, horizontal injection molding machines, the company said.
Nagano-based Nissei had said in late 2010 that it was looking at a factory in western Asia to handle growing demand in India, Pakistan and surrounding countries, but it said the Thai factory instead will handle that region.
It stressed that expanding sales in western Asia will still be one of the primary goals of the new facility.
It said, however, that it is setting up in Thailand because of that country's substantial market, because Thailand offered favorable tax breaks in the industrial estate and because the country has been actively working to build trade agreements with its neighbors in the Association of Southeast Asian Nations economic bloc.
The factory will have almost 55,000 square feet of manufacturing space, and sit on 4 acres of land. It will employ 50 people.
Nissei set up its first factory outside Japan in 2009, in Taicang, China, near Shanghai.
Japanese press makers have been expanding rapidly outside of their home market in recent years, looking to cut their costs in the face of strong international competition and escape their country's strong yen.
That investment initially focused on China, but is increasingly turning to other parts of Asia. Two Nissei rivals, Toshiba Machine Co. Ltd. and Sodick Plustech Co. Ltd., set up factories in Thailand last year, for example.Research Article

Either he kept his hands in his pockets when he met Queen Elizabeth because he was unaware that no gentlemen ever keeps his hands in his pockets when he is meeting anyone -- whether tinker, tart or toff -- which means that he is a lout. Or that he went up to Belfast, freely and of his own accord, and very deliberately kept his hands in his pockets in her presence, in order to establish some political point. Which also means that he is a lout.
From Herald.ie: See the pictures of Ronan O'Gara meeting the Queen.
And those bigoted midgets who have applauded him for his bad manners have merely shown that they are louts also.
Some things are important. You do not insult the flag of another country, and you do not show disrespect for its head of state.
The English captain Martin Johnson showed such disrespect to the President at Lansdowne Road by refusing to stand closer to the presidential red carpet, thereby making her walk over to him to shake his hand. Whether he did so accidentally or deliberately is irrelevant. He should have been publicly rebuked by the English Rugby Union and forced to apologise. He wasn't and he didn't. He is a lout also.
What he did was a serious breach of international protocol. But this should not have set a standard of Anglo-Hibernian bad manners to which Ronan O'Gara then uniquely adhered. (After all, no other Irish player felt the need to behave like him). Which means, if intentional, he went 300 miles to insult the sovereign of a friendly power. How heroic.
Which brings us to the tiresome issue, YET AGAIN, of ourselves and the British monarchy. Frankly, I am bored out of my skull with this pathetic, infantile obsession about Ireland not being British and therefore we don't invite the Queen (yes, that's deliberate) to this country. Only nationalist dwarves accept that argument. If she can visit Germany, whose cities were laid waste in her lifetime, with tens of thousands of civilians being slaughtered in their homes by an air force whose commander in chief was her father, then she can surely visit Ireland.
This issue has all the hallmarks of a very stupid family row. We know that the vast majority of Irish people use the term "the Queen" when describing the monarch of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland. Even Seamus Heaney wrote that in his family they never raised a glass to toast the Queen: yes, his capital letter.
The largest immigrant group in Ireland is British. For decades, the largest immigrant group in Britain was Irish. The laws of Ireland are based on English common law, and Irish barristers wear black in mourning for Queen Anne (died 1714). I could go on. So could you. This is because we all know the fundamental truths of this issue.
The culmination of next's season rugby championship will also see the 70th anniversary of the commissioning of Michael Floud Blaney, a Catholic and nationalist from Newry, and a graduate of UCD, into the Royal Engineers. He was rushed through a mine-defusing course, becoming one of the first of the new generation of bomb-disposals officers.
In September 1940, an unexploded German bomb in East London was paralysing traffic and preventing thousands of workers from doing vital war-duties. Captain Blaney volunteered to defuse the bomb, and working alone -- a method he pioneered -- he succeeded.
A month later, a new type of bomb was found in London. Fitted with two very dangerous time fuses, its sole purpose was to kill bomb-disposals officers like him. However, it was causing major economic dislocation and had to be tackled.
Again he volunteered to defuse it alone. He was successful. Then, a fortnight before Christmas, just after his 30th birthday, Captain Blaney was called to deal with another bomb. It had lain unexploded for several days, and was causing huge economic disruption. As usual he crawled unaccompanied into the crater, and while he worked on it the bomb exploded.
KING George VI -- the father of the woman in whose company Ronan O'Gara thought it appropriate to keep his hands in his pockets -- awarded Captain Michael Floud Blaney a posthumous George Cross, the highest possible British decoration for a soldier not personally present in the face of the enemy.
As Ronan O'Gara travelled North last week to insult -- either intentionally or otherwise -- the Queen, he would have passed Newry Old Chapel Graveyard, where the remains of Captain Michael Floud Blaney GC are buried.
How many people now know of this gallant man in the town where he was born, and where he had once been in charge of the roads department? Not many, I'd guess. Still, it's worth remembering that he used his hands to save life, not insult people.
The ultimate reward of the endeavours of so many Irishmen like him is also known by the name "freedom", beside which two words such as "Grand Slam" or "Ronan O'Gara" do not properly belong.In Honor of‚Ä¶Jeremy Cockrell
My son, only child was killed by a drunk driver on Nov. 15, 2014. Its been exactly seven years since I got to hear his beautiful voice. He loved to sing & do karaoke as often as he could. He also played the guitar. I really miss hearing him & getting those famous bear hugs he would give. But, all that plus his contagious smile was all taken from me because an ex- police officer decided to drink & drive. And the end result was taken the life of Jeremy & injuring jeremys friend who was with him in the truck. Not a day or moment goes by that I don‚Äôt think of him & wish he was still here with me. I had just lost his dad two years earlier, so he was all I had left. All because some made the stupid decision to drink & drive!!!

10May06When Microsoft announced in June that the default file formats in the next-generation Office suite would be based on XML, there was reason to both hope and question whether open computing was headed for a major victory. If Office 12, slated for release next year, starts churning out documents that are truly interoperable with any back-end system via standard XML, a floodgate of possibilities will open.
"Microsoft Office is behind more than 80 percent of the electronic documents that exist in the world," says MarkLogic chief technologist Paul Pedersen. "If it commits to a stable, open schema, there will be an explosion of value-added applications."
Simple Office templates could serve as front-end interfaces for complex enterprise applications and line-of-business systems, so users could create invoices or purchase requisitions without training on complex systems. Once a name or account number is typed in, the template could automatically extract data available from back-end systems to fill the missing fields. Complex, formulaic reports or forecasts could be automated with templates that would extract data on schedule or whenever it's refreshed and then recalculate the numbers ‚Äî just a few possibilities Microsoft outlined as part of its Office Open XML announcement ().
Still, some wonder if the greatest potential will be reserved for Microsoft tools and environments. "Time and again, Microsoft press releases going back to Office 2000 have crowed about how version X would write or read XML," says Kurt Cagle, senior architect at software developer Mercurial Communications, author of The XML Developer's Handbook (Sybex, 2000) and publisher of. "The content was either unobtainable without Microsoft tools, included 'extensions' that rendered it inoperable on most XML parsers or was so complex, it drove stylesheet developers crazy."
Microsoft counters that Office 2003 XML reference schemas are already available to everyone through a royalty-free license. "Microsoft publishes the specs for the reference schemas to ensure anyone can build products and solutions that exchange data freely with documents using the formats," responds Office program manager Brian Jones. He adds that Office uses an MSXML parser that "conforms extremely well to the XML standard," although his comments stop short of claiming broad compatibility with third-party parsers, tools used to analyze text-based input and break it into its constituent parts.
As for schema stability, Jones says that as new features get added to Office, "the schemas will change in very well-defined ways. There's an extensibility mechanism built into the schemas that will be fully documented. As long as an application supports that simple mechanism, there will be no issues in dealing with XML files generated in future versions of Office."
Cagle says he's hopeful Microsoft's new formats will be as open as the name suggests. "If Microsoft actually achieves this target, [you'll be able] to use Word documents within XML-oriented content management products that aren't tied to Windows implementations."
Mainstream press coverage of the Office Open XML announcement focused largely on how users will be able to salvage .doc, .xsl and .ppt files and keep creating them for legacy apps. Microsoft will provide a utility to upgrade Office 2000/XP/2003 files, and Office 12 will let you "save as" to the old binary formats.Stormont party leaders to put LGBT+ rights under microscope at PinkNews‚Äô Northern Ireland reception

Leading figures from Northern Ireland‚Äôs six main political parties will discuss LGBT+ rights at the PinkNews Virtual Summer Reception on Thursday (1 July).
The event, which is being run in partnership with Citi and The Rainbow Project, will see leaders from across the political spectrum reflecting on how far Northern Ireland has come on LGBT+ issues.
They will also discuss what needs to happen next to ensure Northern Ireland‚Äôs LGBT+ community has full equality.
Sinn F√©in president Mary Lou McDonald TD will represent her party at the reception. McDonald is a sitting TD in the Republic of Ireland and is also leader of the opposition in the country‚Äôs parliament.
Alliance Party leader Naomi Long MLA will also participate in the virtual reception. She currently serves as Minister for Justice in the Northern Ireland Executive.
Paula Bradley MLA will represent the socially conservative Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) at the event. She was appointed deputy leader of the party in May following Arlene Foster‚Äôs resignation.
Doug Beattie MLA of the Ulster Unionist Party (UUP) will also take part in the reception. Just months ago, he tabled a motion in the Northern Ireland Assembly that called for conversion therapy to be banned in the region.
Colum Eastwood MP, leader of the Social Democratic and Labour Party (SDLP), will represent his party at the event.
Green Party deputy leader Mal O‚ÄôHara, a councillor for Castle, will also take part in the PinkNews Virtual Summer Reception.
The event will be moderated by John O‚ÄôDoherty, director of the Rainbow Project.
The PinkNews summer reception comes after months of political unrest in Northern Ireland
Political leaders in Northern Ireland have been using the PinkNews summer reception to draw attention to the glaring gaps in LGBT+ rights and equality for a number of years now.
In 2018, the event became the focus of significant media attention when then-DUP leader Arlene Foster attended, making her first of the party‚Äôs leaders to attend an event focused on LGBT+ rights.
In past years, politicians in Northern Ireland have taken the opportunity to demand marriage equality and to draw attention to the discrepancies between the treatment of LGBT+ people across the UK.
The summer reception is a vital opportunity for Northern Ireland‚Äôs LGBT+ community to find out where their political leaders stand on queer people‚Äôs rights and equality.
The event comes after a number of months of political unrest in Northern Ireland.
Arlene Foster resigned as first minister and as leader of the DUP following an internal heave against her in April. Just weeks later, Edwin Poots was appointed leader.
However, he was ousted just 20 days later by his own party after he appointed Paul Girvan as first minister ‚Äì a move DUP colleagues were not on board with.
Northern Ireland has historically been slower than the rest of the UK to advance LGBT+ rights. Marriage equality finally became a reality in 2020 after a history-making intervention from Westminster, which saw MPs push through legislative change following years of stagnation.
Conversion therapy is just one of the issues facing Northern Ireland‚Äôs LGBT+ community right now. There is broad cross-party support for a legislative ban on the practice ‚Äì which seeks to change a person‚Äôs sexual or gender identity ‚Äì however, the DUP has pushed back against efforts to prohibit conversion therapy in religious settings.
The Assembly voted overwhelmingly in favour of a motion put forward by UUP leader Doug Beattie in April that calls for an extensive legislative ban on conversion therapy.
The PinkNews Virtual Summer Reception, in partnership with Citi and the Rainbow Project, will take place on Thursday (1 July) from 7pm to 8.30pm. The event will be live-streamed on PinkNews‚Äô Facebook page.

I would have posted this response to your lastest your Daily Mail blog article peter but I note you now have blocked my e mail from leaving comments on the site, though usually you never allow them to be posted online anyway so no real loss.
Today the penny finally dropped about you peter.
You are still a Marxist, though one that today masquerades as a Reactionary.
Peter was a Trotskyist who was a member of the International Socialists from 1969 to 1975, and joined the British Labour Party in 1977, campaigning for Ken Livingstone's parliamentary candidature for Hampstead in the 1979 general election.
Hitchens left the Labour Party in 1983 when he became a political reporter at the Daily Express and thought it "no longer appropriate to carry a party card".
Peter wasnt just one your usual 'reds' though, one of those pathetic simpering 'ruprechts and ruperts' drooling, mewling idiots we see holding a Hope Not Hate poster on our streets shouting ' Waaaaccciiisst' but a Revolutionary Red, a member of the Revolutionary Red intelligensia.
For 6 years he was a Revolutionary Red, and one of the top turds perched upon the pile of hundreds of thousands of little turds.
Then then he became a political red, moving into the Establishment from university.
Then he became a media red - and then all of a sudden he became a Paleo-Conservative Reactionary writing in the Daily Mail.
Bullshit.
This was a phased process, a transition from one revolutionary form to another.
The Revolutionary Red who once waved the red flag, was now waving a blue flag for the conservatives - but he was still a red where it counted, on the inside and still committed to the downfall of British society and our way of life.
This creep is the most successful revolutionary red in British history.
He is the Kim Philby of Fleet Street, one of the last great red vipers from the Cold War still nestling in the bosom of the establishment.
He is a serpent that whispers poison into the ears of our society, and his lisps are the whispers of treason inside our city gate.
He whispers of sterility, senility, servitude and apathy.
The idea that an ideologically committed Revolutionary Red like Hitchens could become an ideologically Paleo-Conservative Reactionary is so rare that I cannot see it happening.
The phased process of Peter Hitchens conversion also suggests a Red moving into the mainstream of the Establishment and then working within the Establishment using classic Gramscian methodology - eg being someone who is using the right wing media to ensure the entire right wing of British politics, from paleo-conservatism to nationalism, are unable to organise.
Therefore I suggest that he and his brother as Gramscists made a conscious decision to use the media from inside the media against the social and cultural values that bound our nation together.
Christopher attacks the centre from the left, Peter from the right.
Each eats away at the centre whilst also ensuring the political forces, social forces and cultural forces of Nationalism and Classic Liberalism, which were once at the core of our society, are unable to organise within society.
Peter Hitchens ensures that the ideas, values and ideology of Nationalism are attacked in the media and that paelo-conserative reaction is promoted to the masses. He seeks to perpetuate the same conservative social forces, institutions, ideas, values and ideology that have led to the current crisis.
This allows the Corporatocracy to remain in power either with a Leftist multi-culturalism perspective or a Paleo-Conservative Globalist perspective.
Hitchens supports the Church, traditional conservative values and liberal conservative values.
Yet these are the very institutions that have been hijacked by the Left and infected with political correctness.
Empowering politically the Church of England in todays society is like empowering the Communist Party - the old Nationalist Church of England for the English people that represented the interests of England and the English is now regarded as 'racist' by a majority of those frock wearing freaks and reds that infest its palaces and cathedrals.
Therefore supporting those institutions or empowering those institutions merely empowers the enemies of Nationalism.
Peter Hitchens says 'DO NOT VOTE, TORY, BNP OR UKIP' and therefore at a stroke the entire right wing of British politics is immediately disengaged from participating in the political process, thereby allowing the left and liberals to organise and impose the Servile State upon us.
He supports the most reactionary, regressive forces in British society being re-empowered, feeble institutions such as the Church of England now in the grip of liberal senility, in order to ensure NATIONALIST forces are unable to arise and organise, both within and outside those institutions.
He supports a paleo-conservative party of the right, which nowhere exists other than in his own mind, whose political manifesto, programme and agenda is simply to perpetuate the failed values of the Tory reactionary right that caused the crisis in society the first place. The fact that no such party of the paleo-conservative right exists or will ever exist means he spend the entire time attacking and undermining the political groups that do organise to represent the right in elections.
Therefore even if Hitchens dream party did arise and flourish - its paleo-conservative values would merely pepetuate and repeat the mistakes of the paleo-conservative past. Its very existence would ensure our nations destruction.
Hitchens stands, knees knocking with fear, before the ideal of Nationalism.
He fears and hates Nationalism as much as the Marxists and Capitalists fear and hate Nationalism.
Peter looks at Nationalism and his bottom lip quivers.
" Better a slow death and cultural alzheimers than rebirth and the nationalist revolution ", are the words of the old grey men of the past of the establishment political parties and their puppet politicians - or they are the whispers of a sly old wolf still hunting down its prey in the darkness of a deceit.
Hitchens wants our country chained forever to the dead historical weight of Conservatism and the Tory Party.
There can be only one response to Globalism and that is Nationalism.
By embracing and perpetuating the values and ideals of Conservatism we as a people and nation will merely perpetuate and repeat the mistakes of the past.
We demand a new future under Nationalism.
Hitchens demands we abandon politics, embrace a dead culture of conservatism and surrender our politics to an emasculated Tory Party.
If the worst that Hitchens can do for the country is demand a return to the obsolete ideology and politics of Conservatism in the Daily Mail, then he truly is the most dangerous Red in the country.
If he aint red, then he ought to be.
7 comments:
The Hitchens'political stance is a maelstrom of conflicting doctrines. Hitchens major(P),is senior in name only. Hitchens minor has shifted his poitical allegiance seismically, however he is a man intellectual rigour and has defended at times the unpopular - David Stirling for example - against a hostile liberal elite. In short Hitchens minor is not entirely a bought and blinded man like his confused sibling. If you want examples look on you tube and see him outline his disgust at the treachery of Rowan Williams for proposing sharia law in England. He might not be perfect but he's not a coward and I for one would welcome an exchange with the US - minor for major.

Excellent article Lee.
Correction - David Irving, oops.

Excellent article. I knew there was something highly dodgy about Peter Hitchens, all the 'What can we do?'helpless hand-wringing stuff.
Sibling rivalry can be a bitch.
Peter Hitchens reminds me of the chaplain at my former school. Convinced in his own delusions, living on this planet but detached from reality. When I have seen him on TV he comes across as rather tedious company and intellectually not the sharpest tool. I suspect he has a personality disorder.
Like Litlejohn he will dance to any tune as long as the piper pays.
Excellent article, Lee.
I would urge everyone to digg this so that we may hopefully get Lee's article to the top of the search engines whenever someone searches for this creep's name.Marcel is one of the villagers in the Animal Crossing New Horizons.

In this project we want to use wearables, technical devices that you wear on your body, to give the care sector a helping hand. In particular, we are talking about a wearable that looks like a watch that measures stress so that burn-outs can be detected and even avoided.
Mobilab & Care developed an online platform together with the Psychology, Technology & Society Expertise Cell of Applied Psychology at Thomas More college. There you can find algorithms that go with the wearables and a manual that explains how to use them both. In this way, the wearables can be used in the prevention of burnout and the treatment of depression.
GOALS
The objective of the Carewear project is to deploy wearable technology in organizations and enterprises active in well-being at work and in Mental Health Care (MHC). In this way they can improve their functioning. Using a wearable, for example, a professional care provider can then monitor the condition of the client, analyze it and offer appropriate assistance.
The goal is to develop the following tools:
- Algorithms to detect stress, physical activity and heart rate variability.
- An online platform where the mental health professional and client can view that measured data.
- Manuals and expertise on evidence-based interventions supported by wearable technology.
RELEVANCE
More and more people are having mental health problems, and the current corona crisis is only intensifying that problem.
To fight depression, for example, it is important to get outside a lot and be active often. A wearable can measure this. When someone looks at the data measured by the wearable, they have the opportunity to see which days went well and to pinpoint possible causes or recognize a pattern. If, for example, someone felt bad on a particular day, the data could show that that person had an unpleasant telephone call from his or her supervisor or was stuck in traffic again. The wearable could then make a connection between the activity and the mental wellbeing, and then a solution could be sought through that information.
The method that is currently often used in practice is a diary that must be filled in by the patient. What happened today? How did you feel today? Such questions must then be filled in by the patient in writing, but that‚Äôs not ideal. For example, when someone fills out the schedule just before going to bed, they have to try to remember everything from the previous day. Moreover, we sometimes repress unpleasant events to protect ourselves. Also, we may not always feel it ourselves when we are experiencing stress.
Carewear offers a solution for this. The wearable itself registers what happens when. All this data can be looked back on later by both the professional and the client and the data is also collected over a longer period. That is valuable because in this way certain patterns can be recognized.
OUR ROLE
Mobilab & Care‚Äôs task was to develop algorithms to convert the raw measured signals into interpretable variables. Those measured signals were heart rate, heart rate variability, physical activity and stress peaks. Stress peaks are measured using a combination of skin conductance, heart rate, and exercise.
FUTURE
Work on and with wearables is ongoing. For example, our expertise on the physiological signals from wearables is being further deployed in collaboration with other national and international research and care institutions. In addition, a number of publications are being written and approved. Moreover, the researchers are working on grant applications for follow-up projects to Carewear.

While most employment litigation in Georgia involves either a federal employment statute, such as Title VII, or is grounded in a contractual dispute, such as a failure to pay commissions, employment disputes can give rise to state-law torts depending on the conduct alleged. For example, if an employer‚Äôs manager subjects her to sexual harassment that includes offensive touching, this conduct may give rise not only to claims for sexual harassment under Title VII but also to civil assault and battery causes of action against both the manager and the employer. Further, the employee may also be able to assert a claim against the employer for negligent hiring and retention if she can show that it should have known that it was foreseeable that the harasser would engage in the behavior at issue.
Atlanta employment attorney Justin Scott provides representation to both employers and employees in cases in which there are allegations of tortious conduct arising out of the employment relationship.Civil Battery
Georgia law creates a cause of action for civil battery when one person unlawfully touches another. Generally speaking, an unlawful touching is ‚Äúone which is ‚Äòoffensive,‚Äô and an ‚Äòoffensive‚Äô touching is one which proceeds from anger, rudeness, or lust.‚Äù Newsome v. Cooper‚ÄìWiss, Inc., 179 Ga.App. 670, 672, 347 S.E.2d 619, cert. denied (1986). What is ‚Äúoffensive‚Äù in this context is measured based on an objective ‚Äúreasonable person‚Äù standard, meaning that the analysis addresses whether a reasonable person would find the contact at issue to be offensive.
In general, an employer is not liable for torts such as civil battery committed by its employees. This is because such an action is considered to be ‚Äúpurely personal in nature‚Äù and therefore outside the scope of the employment of the person who committed the act. However, arguably, employers may regardless be liable for such torts if they ratified the conduct. Fowler v. Sunrise Carpet Indus., Inc., 911 F. Supp. 1560, 1585 (N.D. Ga. 1996)1. Further, as set forth below, employers may be liable for negligent hiring and retention.‚Äù Harvey v. McLaughlin, 198 Ga.App. 105, 107, 400 S.E.2d 635 (1990).Civil Assault
Assault, as distinct from battery (although the two are frequently conflated), occurs ‚Äú‚Äòwhen all the apparent circumstances, reasonably viewed, are such as to lead a person reasonably to apprehend a violent injury from the unlawful act of another.‚Äô‚Äù EEOC v. Nunez, Inc., 2011 WL 13168394, at *21 (N.D. Ga. February 28, 2011) (quoting Everett v. Goodloe, 268 Ga. App. 536, 543 (2004)). The assault therefore is the injury caused when the person reasonably expects that the offensive touching will occur. As with the intentional tort of battery, an employer is not generally liable for an assault committed by an employee acting outside the scope of his employment unless the plaintiff can show ratification and/or pursues the theory of negligent hiring and retention.Negligent Hiring & Retention
As stated above, an employer may be liable for negligently hiring or retaining an employee who commits a civil tort, such as a sexual battery,.‚Äù Magnum v. Republic Indus., Inc., 260 F. Supp. 2d 1229, 1255 (N.D. Ga. 2003). Plaintiffs in these cases will point to the past conduct of the harasser, and complaints made to the employer about his conduct, to demonstrate that it should have been foreseeable that he would harass the plaintiff and/or other co-workers. See Pittman v. Ulmer Enter. Inc., 2006 WL 8432198, at *5 (N.D. Ga. June 23, 2006) (‚ÄúPast complaints of harassment against a particular employee, made to the employer, provide an employer with knowledge of that individual‚Äôs propensity for such conduct for purposes of negligent retention.‚Äù).
Contact Scott Employment Law, P.C. at (678) 780-4880 for assistance with employment disputes, including civil battery, assault and/or negligent hiring and retention, or contact the firm online here.1 There is currently an open question under Georgia law as to whether an employer can ratify an action taken by an employee which was not done for the employer‚Äôs benefit. See Travis Pruitt & Assoc., P.C. v. Hooper, 277 Ga. App. 1 (2006).If you are entering records via one of the "Enter a list of records" type forms, it is possible to change the settings for the species names that you can choose from. To do this, you need to click on the filter icon next to the "Species" column heading:
This opens up a window where there are two settings that you can change:
The first of these settings allows you to specify that you only want to see species names from a particular species group, so that if you were entering a list of plants you could restrict the species name searches to show only plants.
The second setting allows you to choose whether you want to see common names or scientific names, and whether you want to see only the current preferred scientific name, or any older versions of the scientific names (synonyms):
Once you have chosen the settings that you want, click on "Apply".
Synonym example
If you set your form to show "All names including common names and synonyms" you will be able to enter records using the older, non-preferred names. For instance, the Common Marbled Carpet moth used to be called Chloroclysta truncata, but the genus name changed recently and it is now Dysstroma truncata. If you form is set to show all names, you will be able to add this moth using the name Chloroclysta truncata:
When you enter Chloroclysta truncata the name is accepted, and it displays that this is a synonym for the current recommended name Dysstroma truncata. The name you used to enter the record will be stored in the database, but any reports and downloads will display the record using the current recommended name.LimeSurvey is one of the many open source survey applications written in PHP, and uses a MySQL or PostgreSQL database. LimeSurvey is a user-friendly web application that allows users to develop, publish and collect responses to surveys. Users can use rich text in questions and messages using a rich text editor, and images and videos can easily be integrated into surveys. Surveys can be public, or can be strictly controlled through the use of ‚Äòonce-only‚Äô tokens for each survey participant.

A ‚Äústreet legal‚Äù Camry screams its way to 200.
Both have engines. Both have 4 wheels. Both are technically ‚Äúcars‚Äù.
So what accounts for the difference in velocity?
Simple:
The Mclaren F1 is engineered for speed. While the Camry is happy to just cruise along.
The same can be said about your B2B sales process.
Some software businesses are ‚Äúengineered‚Äù to max out at 10 or 15k MRR‚Ä¶
‚Ä¶ while others boast a speed velocity that allows them to scale 10x that ‚Äì fast.
In this weeks‚Äô video, I talk about the 5 steps that fuel your speed velocity ‚Äî allowing you to close bigger deals, faster‚Ä¶ and engineer record-breaking revenue numbers month after month.

At a high level, here‚Äôs how to engineer your way to a higher sales velocity:
- Measure Sales Velocity
- Increase Quality of Leads
- Grow Your Deal Size
- Decrease Your Sales Cycle
- Know Your Numbers
Of course, it all starts with measuring your velocity. (Pearson‚Äôs law for the win) üòâ
If you don‚Äôt know it (no judging)‚Ä¶
‚Ä¶ I give you the quick and dirty formula in the video.
From there, you can start pulling the other 4 ‚Äúlevers‚Äù to predictably engineer a faster sales velocity, and blow past your previous MRR record.
Mclaren F1 or a Camry.
Your call üòâ
Watch the video and then drop me a comment letting me know what your sales velocity currently clocks in at, and what steps you plan to implement right away to close bigger deals faster.
What follows below is a lightly edited transcript of the video.
Dan: Hey there. I‚Äôm Dan Martell, technology entrepreneur, investor, and creator of SaaS Academy. In this video, I‚Äôm going to share with you a strategy to increase your SaaS sales velocity without adding any new reps and be sure to stay at the end. We‚Äôre going to share with you an exclusive resource called the rocket demo builder goes over my five principles to close more deals and the nine steps they‚Äôre going to need to follow to make that happen.
Dan: Maybe you‚Äôre doing all the demos today or you‚Äôve got a team of reps that are working with your potential customers and they‚Äôre just not performing really well and you‚Äôre frustrated because it‚Äôs costing you money and obviously lost opportunity and what you want is essentially a process for bringing on a new sales rep on your sales team to get them to close faster, to get the deals to get bigger, to essentially increase the total net new MRR, monthly recurring revenue you‚Äôre adding to the bottom line. You see, when I was starting my company Flowtown, we hired our first couple reps. that was always the challenge. As a founder, I could communicate, sell and do really well, but as soon as I had to have other people involved in that process, it got really challenging. So what I needed to figure out for myself is how do I measure things? How do I get clear on the specific outcomes I want for my sales reps and my sales process and really move that forward?
Dan: And these are the five things you need to do to increase your sales velocity.
Dan: 1. Measure your sales velocity, it‚Äôs a really simple formula. Get out a pencil and a pen and I‚Äôll walk you through it. Number one, we need to figure out, uh, what is the number of leads that we‚Äôre actually generating on a 30 day window. Once we have that, then we want to figure out what our conversion to close rate is or what‚Äôs called the win rate of our deals. Multiply that by the number of leads. And then finally multiply that by the average deal size. Once you have it, then divide those three numbers by the average days to close a deal. And that will give you your sales velocity rate. This is the number one sales metrics you should be measuring for your SaaS business.
If your sales velocity is higher you are ultimately making money faster. Please pay very close attention to the following steps where I explain the strategy on increasing your sales velocity.
Dan: 2. Increase the quality of your leads. Now if you‚Äôve already mapped out that formula and you know kind of where the leads are, then it‚Äôs all about improving the quality.
Dan: So the first thing I‚Äôm going to suggest is to sit down with your marketing team and really get clear and defined on what‚Äôs considered an MQL or what‚Äôs called a Marketing Qualified Lead. The other thing you could do is talk to them about introducing lead scoring so that you only get certain opportunities are actually highly qualified in the market eager to potentially buy your product. Other things you can do is account based marketing list, so essentially being very deliberate on targeting specific companies that you want to work with. And then for me, finally it‚Äôs installing marketing automation because I believe that you should have your marketing take care of the market till they‚Äôre ready to buy.
Dan: 3. Grow your deal size. Now, this is probably the biggest opportunity for most of you watching this. As you‚Äôre doing demos, you‚Äôre talking to customers, you want to look for opportunities to upsell and cross sell.
Dan: Those are pretty traditional things, but is your pricing optimized? Just think about the way you‚Äôre doing valleys. Are you pricing based on a value driver and how your customer‚Äôs gonna use the product? Do you position your product appropriately for the value proposition that you drive theirs? And every industry has a different kind of need that if you can actually use that industry in vertical information to um, customize the presentation, you can drive up the deal size just by showing other customers that have bought more and got a lot of success with your product. And finally, I would say just team training. At the end of the day, if your team doesn‚Äôt know how to deal with objections and negotiate deals, um, present properly, then you‚Äôre always gonna have a challenge around growing the average deal size.
Dan: 4. Decrease your sales cycle. When it comes to looking at the speed of the sales cycle, you need to map it out.
Dan: You need to break it down step by step. Some clients that I coach, I recommend doing this in a Trello or just on a big whiteboard and just walk through the whole sales process. Who‚Äôs involved, what are the different steps, the decision makers, etc., I teach a framework in my rocket demo called the virtual close to understand who‚Äôs involved in actually making a decision within an organization. But, um, there‚Äôs a ton of different techniques to increase the sales velocity. One of my favorite that I recently learned from my friend Michael Litt, the CEO and founder of vidyard, was that they have this motto amongst their sales reps is essentially make more friends within the organization. If a deal doesn‚Äôt have enough context assigned to it, the manager will just say, make more friends and that‚Äôll help you increase, you know, the champions, the decision makers, the influence your product has within an organization and will obviously improve your sales velocity and reduce your sales cycle length.
Dan: 5. Know your numbers. As I mentioned, you need to map it out, you need to break it down, but more importantly, you need to understand the whole pipeline. And that‚Äôs everything from even measuring sales velocity. When I sit down with clients, like sometimes they‚Äôre struggling just to get those numbers. They don‚Äôt know what their close rate or their win rate is. They don‚Äôt understand how to measure the average deal size or average deal value or they‚Äôre not measuring it appropriately. So really important to map it out, understand your numbers and really look at the industry best practices, the vertical that you‚Äôre in, the kind of product that you sell in the companies you serve, what are their numbers based on where you‚Äôre at so you can benchmark and ensure that you‚Äôre focusing on improving the right part of the funnel because there is a point of diminishing returns.
Dan: So the key area is to know your numbers, map it to industry best practices, and then focus on your least performing a process in that pipeline to increase the overall sales velocity, the one sales metric which tells you how your sales team is performing.
Dan: So quick recap. One, measure sales velocity.
Dan: Two, Increase quality of leads.
Dan: Three, Grow the deal size.
Dan: Four, Decrease your sales cycle.
Dan: Five, Know your numbers. As I mentioned in this video, I want to share an exclusive download with you. It‚Äôs called the Rocket Demo Builder‚Ñ¢. I go over the five principles that you need to understand to really close bigger deals faster, specifically the 10 80 10 principle, as well as the virtual close strategy. And I even give you the nine step, workflow for you to customize the rocket demo for your specific situation, it had helped my clients who had a longer sales cycle to close faster.Opinion News > Computers Dell's XPS 13 With OLED Is Love at First Sight Or it was until Apple released the M1 iPad Pro May 26, 2021 12:50 Computers Mobile Phones Internet & Security Computers & Tablets Smart Life Home Theater & Entertainment Software & Apps Social Media Streaming Gaming View More Key Takeaways Dell‚Äôs XPS 13 is now available with an OLED display.OLED‚Äôs excellent contrast and deep, inky shadows demolish LCD screens.Brightness and HDR performance are still OLED‚Äôs Achilles heel. Matthew S. Smith / Lifewire Dell‚Äôs XPS 13 is now available with an OLED display, and it‚Äôs gorgeous. OLED remains strangely rare among laptops. All of today‚Äôs most popular phones, including Apple‚Äôs iPhone and Samsung‚Äôs Galaxy line, have embraced it in a warm, fuzzy, high-contrast hug. Yet few laptops have taken the same step, and those that have are typically large, powerful 15-inch models aimed at a niche audience. A week with the Dell XPS 13‚Äôs OLED left me wishing the tech was more readily available on modern laptops. Yet its arrival in the XPS 13 might be a case of too little, too late. Why OLED? OLED is self-emissive, which means each individual pixel creates its own light. This also means each pixel can be shut off entirely, achieving a deep, abyssal black that a typical LCD panel can‚Äôt match. Most high-end laptops have great displays: the MacBook Pro 13, Microsoft Surface Laptop 4, and prior Dell XPS 13 all can impress with bright, vibrant images. Yet they fail when displaying photos or dark, atmospheric movies. "The real competition isn‚Äôt the MacBook Pro. It‚Äôs Apple‚Äôs iPad Pro 12.9 with the new Liquid Retina XDR display..." Starlit skies that should contrast the infinite darkness of space against brilliant points of light instead look hazy, as if a light fog had crept into the shot. Dell‚Äôs XPS 13 with OLED doesn‚Äôt have that problem. Shadows have true depth, providing a sense of presence and realism not found from competing LCD laptop displays. This advantage isn‚Äôt just for 4K movies or high-res photos. On the contrary, I appreciate it most when doing what I‚Äôm doing at this very moment: writing. The Dell XPS 13‚Äôs OLED looks distinct from LCD laptops. It‚Äôs as if the screen is not a screen at all, but instead a page ripped from an enchanted high-gloss magazine that can magically change form. It‚Äôs simply fantastic. It‚Äôs Not All Good News Despite its strengths, I admit the XPS 13‚Äôs new OLED screen falls into its own familiar trap. OLED often lacks the brightness of LCD rivals, and Dell‚Äôs XPS 13 doesn‚Äôt resolve this issue. Dell pegs the OLED‚Äôs maximum brightness at 400 nits, which, in my testing, it came close to achieving. That‚Äôs enough for use in a typical room with modest light control. The display rarely feels dim. However, Dell claims the screen has an anti-reflective coating, which, frankly, is ridiculous. I don‚Äôt doubt it dampens reflections, but, as with many laptops, it‚Äôs not enough: the screen can double as a mirror to freshen up before a video call. The OLED‚Äôs maximum brightness can‚Äôt compete with glare from bright overhead lights or a sunlit window. Matthew S. Smith / Lifewire This also leads to disappointing HDR. The XPS 13 supports HDR, but it doesn‚Äôt pop that way it does on today‚Äôs best televisions or smartphones. Windows also forces HDR off by default when a laptop is on battery power (it is possible to turn it on by tweaking settings), which will annoy travelers who like to watch movies on a laptop. OLED also skews towards a white point that‚Äôs cool and green, and Dell hasn‚Äôt resolved this problem. Scenes that rely on bright, white highlights, like a snowy mountaintop, can look unnatural. I doubt most owners will pick up on this issue, but, when the XPS 13‚Äôs OLED is placed side-by-side with a quality LCD laptop display (like that on the ThinkPad X1 Carbon), it becomes obvious. Dell XPS 13 vs. MacBook Pro vs. iPad Pro OLED‚Äôs downsides make it more of an alternative, rather than a straight upgrade, over the quality LCDs available in Apple's MacBooks and in Lenovo laptops. In fact, Dell offers its own 500-nit 4K LCD for the XPS 13, and I can see why some would choose it. OLED makes sense in a home office with proper light control, but a brighter LCD could be preferable for travel. "A week with the Dell XPS 13‚Äôs OLED left me wishing the tech was more readily available on modern laptops. Yet its arrival in the XPS 13 might be a case of too little, too late." This isn‚Äôt the flawless victory Dell and OLED fans might hope for. And the real competition isn‚Äôt the MacBook Pro. It‚Äôs Apple‚Äôs iPad Pro 12.9 with the new Liquid Retina XDR display, which is based on Mini-LED technology. It‚Äôs almost as good as OLED when displaying dark scenes, but destroys it in HDR. The new iPad Pro‚Äôs display has a peak brightness of up to 1,600 nits, with 600 nits sustained. Liquid Retina XDR is exclusive to the 12.9-inch iPad Pro for now, but it‚Äôs sure to make its way to other Apple products, including the MacBook Pro. Which begs the question: if Mini-LED is this good, does OLED have a future in laptops andComing from the rural seaside in West Wales, I moved to London to begin BA Design at Goldsmiths. Graduating with a First class honours with a spectacular finale show, displaying my project titled 'Grandmas Jumper'.
Since graduating I have been privileged to work at Selfridges on the Windows team in creating some of the most spectacular window displays in the world.
My studio work has involved using my very own hand-made glass steam distilling kit and projects have varied from re-creating all the scents from a Victorian pub, sniffing out the Southbank Centre and Milan, and created workshops at Kensington Palace.
In 2013 I started working at the Institute of Making as the Events Co-ordinator. My role involved curating extraordinary, entertaining yet educational events. These ranged from talks, masterclasses, research events, outreach events, corporate away days, factory tours and public open days. There have been nearly 350 events, with an approximate attendance of 12,000 people, with a high proportion of families and young people.
My biggest achievement has been a five-day ‚ÄòFestival of Stuff ‚Äô that attracted 2,000 people; which comprised of four days of bookable masterclasses from wooden whistle carving, chair caning, fabric dyeing, laminate wood forming, to wearable sensor and plant moisture sensor making. The festival culminated in an extravaganza of materials and making; the street outside was packed with a range of demonstrations and making activities.
I was here for 3 and half years when I decided to move to Cardiff to be closer to family.
I am now a freelance events manager working on lots of exciting projects all over the UK.
Currently I am busy planning a making and materials based zone at this years Cheltenham Science Festival, called MakerShack. Come along from 6th - 11th June.
I am also coordinating the degree show for the BA Design course at Goldsmiths, University of London. Visit this from 16th - 19th June.
Excitingly I am coordinating the events for an exciting research project, Hands of X. These events will be happening in Glasgow and several dates in London.
I am a very organised and driven person. Being freelance allows me to manage my own time and be engaged with lots of exciting projects. I have recently moved to Cardiff to be closer to my family and to make more connections with my welsh heritage. I am passionate about all kinds of making and to ensure that no skills are endangered of becoming extinct.Male form Get your Man a TIE!!!

I touched on the benefits of sleep on my last post about the immune system and the role in plays in keeping us fit and healthy.
So now I am going to put more focus on sleep and why we need it and why we should be getting more.
Let‚Äôs face it, we‚Äôve heard for years about getting 8 hours of sleep a night. But how many of us actually get 8 hours? The vast majority of people in the western world don‚Äôt get close to it. Most people probably get closer to 6 hours.
So what‚Äôs the big deal? So you‚Äôre a couple of hours short on your sleep.
How bad can it be?
Honestly, very bad.
It wasn‚Äôt until I read more on sleep. Like anything, you need to understand the positives and the negatives.
So let‚Äôs look at some of the things that sleep effects. Be warned, there are some serious health issues related to not enough sleep.
Ok, so we know we should be 8 hours (7-9 hours). But what happens if you get 6. Or even less.
As I touched on before, sleep plays a big part in keeping your immune system strong and able to fight off disease and bacteria. So if you want to avoid the cold and flu, it‚Äôs important to get your sleep to stay healthy.
But that‚Äôs just the beginning. It gets much more serious than that.
People in the 6 hours or less category are twice as likely to get cancer. It is also a big factor on whether you get Alzheimer‚Äôs disease or not. Even slight reductions for a week disrupts blood sugar levels so much that you would fall under that category of pre-diabetic.
Ok so this just got a lot more serious than, make sure you get enough sleep so you don‚Äôt feel half asleep at work in the morning and you don‚Äôt get the cold. There‚Äôs serious issues involved with not enough sleep.
But wait, there‚Äôs more.
Insufficient sleep increase the likelihood of your arteries blocking and becoming weak and brittle. This then leads to a higher chance of heart disease, stroke and heart failure.Greg Peck moves from his wheelchair to a monoski Saturday as girlfriend Elena Johnson looks on at Winter Park ski area. Peck was participating in the 35th annual Wells Fargo Ski Cup, a benefit for the National Sports Center for the Disabled.
Gerald Hayden of Fresno, Calif., who has a spinal cord injury, crosses the finish line in a race Saturday that teamed professional disabled skiers with able-bodied amateurs.
WINTER PARK ‚Äî When Danelle Umstead started losing her sight at age 13, her world stopped.
‚ÄúI sat around for about five years feeling sorry for myself,‚Äù Umstead said.
But then her dad kicked her off the couch and onto the ski slope. Now, she‚Äôs headed to the 2010 Paralympics in Vancouver, British Columbia, as part of the U.S. Adaptive Ski Team.
Beneath sunny skies and sponsor banners, Umstead has joined 400 racers in Winter Park this weekend for the 35th annual Wells Fargo Ski Cup, a benefit for the National Sports Center for the Disabled.
Saturday‚Äôs race teamed professional disabled skiers with able-bodied amateurs, and included a celebrity fun event. Disabled skiers will test their skills against one another today. The three-day event will raise more than $200,000 for the center‚Äôs disabled- sports programs.
Visually impaired skiers like Umstead are paired with a sighted guide, who narrates the terrain, conditions and movements needed to complete a run while skiing directly in front of their partner, which Umstead said takes incredible trust.
The trust she and her guide share extends off the slopes. They are married and have a 2-year-old son, and compete together in international ski events.
Their marriage makes them a better team on the slopes, said her husband, Rob.
Skiing changed Umstead‚Äôs world, she said, and taught her to love her life, blind or not. The National Sports Center for the Disabled contributed to that.
‚ÄúHere, I‚Äôm getting the best training in the world,‚Äù Umstead said. She lost her vision through retinal disease and macular degeneration..
Last year, the center provided 24,000 ski lessons at its Winter Park facility, many of those taught by dedicated volunteers like Dave Gow. He began volunteering three years ago as a way to give back and to stretch his comfort zone.
‚ÄúI was one of those people who looked away when they saw a disabled person,‚Äù not knowing how to react, Gow said. Now, their stories inspire him. He loves the joy he sees in his students‚Äô faces as they slide over the snow.
A joy that springs from the freedom of the slopes, said Anna Turney. She watched other skiers and chatted with teammates while awaiting her turn to race at Winter Park‚Äôs lively base. Always an active person, Turney broke her back while snowboarding in 2006. About a year later, she returned to the slopes in a monoski. The sport provided needed focus after her accident.
‚ÄúMy whole life revolves around skiing now,‚Äù Turney said.
Even as skies turned gray and snow moved into Winter Park on Saturday afternoon, participants and sponsors were still glad to be there.
‚ÄúIt‚Äôs just such a great event,‚Äù said Cristie Drumm, spokesperson for Wells Fargo in Colorado. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs really an honor to be part of it.‚Äù

If you are new to The Preschool Toolbox and missed the article on how to establish REAL relationships with the numbers 1-5, you can see it here! We use many activities to explore numbers and integrate basic math concepts throughout our preschool days. The Candy Cane Counting Sticks are just one way to combine playful learning and fine motor skills into a seasonal math activity that is also FUN!
Candy Cane Counting Sticks for Preschool!
Free Printable Candy Cane Counting Sticks Toppers ‚Äì Candy Cane Counting Stick Toppers
Materials needed: Wikki Stix (at least 10 per child), Candy Cane Counting Stick Toppers (linked above), pony beads (red/white), scissors, and markers/crayons (for labeling the candy cane template). Note: please supervise young children who still mouth objects closely as pony beads are a choking hazard.
Prior to playing the math games: Print the Candy Cane toppers to heavy paper. Have the children cut out the candy canes (assist younger children with cutting) and laminate for durability. The Candy Cane toppers will adhere to the Wikki Stix (no glue will be necessary).
5 Math Game Suggestions for the Wikki Stix Candy Cane Counting Sticks:
1. One-to-One Correspondence: Label the Candy Cane toppers with any numbers the children have had introduced and put them on top of a Wikki Stix. Ask the children to place the corresponding number of pony beads on the Wikki Stix.
2. Number Order: Label 5 of the Candy Cane toppers with the numbers 6-10 and put them on top of the Wikki Stix. Have the children place the candy canes in the correct number order ‚Äì 6-10.
Variation: Label the Candy Cane toppers with the numbers 1-10 and place the candy canes on top of a Wikki Stix. Have the children place the candy canes in the correct number order (starting at a number OTHER than 1).
3. Ten Sticks and Skip Counting: Label 10 Candy Cane toppers with the number 10 and put the printable toppers on Wikki Stix. Have the children place 10 pony beads on each of the Wikki Stix. These counting sticks make great ‚Äú10 bars‚Äù for counting to 100 by 10‚Äôs. For younger children, label the Candy Cane toppers with various numbers for practice with skip counting by 2‚Äôs and 5‚Äôs.
4. Number Words: Write number words on the Candy Cane toppers and put on top of a Wikki Stix. Have the children place the corresponding number of beads on their Candy Canes. It helps the children understand that the number name refers to a specific quantity of beads.
5. Patterning: Write any basic pattern on the Candy Cane toppers (for example: write AB on one of the Candy Canes. The children must then choose two colors of pony beads [the first chosen color is ‚ÄúA‚Äù; the second chosen color is ‚ÄúB‚Äù] and alternate the colors when placing them on the Wikki Stix.) The picture above shows a simple AB pattern (2 colors) on each of the Candy Cane counting sticks.
Hint: Print the Candy Cane toppers and laminate before cutting out. Dry erase markers can then be used to change the numbers/activities as the children gain confidence and activities are exchanged throughout the season.

I‚Äôm so glad, as I often talk about the products I‚Äôm currently enjoying, but it isn‚Äôt often I get to go back to a product I‚Äôve used, finished (and often repurchased) and wholeheartedly loved. True ‚Äì the oldies aren‚Äôt being shown off in the best photos, as my photo game has improved over the last few years. However, I like being able to bring you guys honest feedback on products I‚Äôd spend my own hard earned money on! So, with that being said ‚Äì read on for my latest installment, my top moisturisers!

Which post has been your favourite?
FAVOURITE MOISTURISERS
Clinique Moisture Surge 72-hour Auto-Replenishing Hydrator
I figured I‚Äôd start with this gem from Clinique, because I have spoken about this at length and so often that you must be sick of me talking about it!
INTENSELY hydrating, INCREDIBLY comforting, and generally like a gigantic class of water for your skin, this is my ultimate choice when it comes to finding something hydrating for my skin. You would never believe that something so delicately-textured would melt into your skin and provide the level of hydation that this does. But it does exactly that. Hyaluronic acid and activated aloe water are what make this product so killer, and I love to use this on a daily basis throughout winter, as it‚Äôs the one product I trust to do a consistent job.
Not only does it provide immediate and long-lasting hydration, it also seals that moisture into the skin and works to reduce water loss. Plus, as with other Clinique products, it‚Äôs allergy tested, 100% fragrance free, non-acnegenic and oil-free.
I make a plan to buy a jar of this at least once a year, always around this time as we head into winter. As soon as I can, you can trust that I‚Äôll be making that purchase.

Keep Your Skin Hydrated With Clinique
Neutrogena Hydro Boost Gel Cream
I know that the Clinique Moisture Surge doesn‚Äôt suit all budgets. If it suited even mine completely (enough for me to use it every single day, FOREVER) I would keep it in constant rotation. So, this product (and the next one) are options for lower budgets, that work in the most similar way.
The Neutrogena Hydro Boost range is fabulous if you suffer with dehydrated skin. Their moisturiser comes in 2 offerings, the Water Gel and the Gel Cream. To be very honest I don‚Äôt find that the Water Gel is enough for my skin, and always gravitate towards the Gel Cream. It‚Äôs closer in consistency to the Clinique Moisture Surge and more intensively hydrating than it‚Äôs thinner-formulated counterpart.
Beautifully light and very hydrating, I would happily use this all year round. I‚Äôve gone through many pots of it, and plan to go through more ‚Äì in fact I want to buy a pot for my Hubby, as he also likes the lighter texture of a gel cream.

Elizabeth Arden Visible Difference Replenishing HydraGel Complex
Another beautiful gel-cream product, this offering from Elizabeth Arden provides incredible hydration, along with a few other great properties.
Not only does it give your skin 24 hour hydration, but it also feels cooling and calming on the skin, it minimises pores and leaves my skin looking airbrushes. Basically, to me it felt like I was always prepping my skin for the most flawless makeup application ever ‚Äì and it‚Äôs packed with skincare goodness like hyaluronic acid, vitamin E and tree mushroom extract.
It‚Äôs placed in between the Neutrogena (drugstore price) and Clinique (higher end price), but don‚Äôt forget you‚Äôre not getting a regular 50ml jar ‚Äì this is a whopping 75ml of product in a beautiful, luxe glass jar!

September Favourites 2018
La Roche-Posay Effaclar Duo SPF30
Only the second product I‚Äôve ever tried from the brand, it left me super duper impressed.
I have combination skin ‚Äì it needs hydration, but I still battle with breakouts, blackheads and oiliness on my T-zone. I opted for this version of the infamous Effaclar Duo so I‚Äôd have the added SPF and not have to pop another product on top. And boy did I enjoy it ‚Äì so much so, I‚Äôd like to purchase the original one so I can use it at night too if the need strikes!
I worried it may be not hydrating enough, as it‚Äôs designed for skin that‚Äôs congested or breakout prone, but it was superbly hydrating without being greasy at all. The formula is silky smooth and feels really lovely to apply, most definitely improved the appearance of blackheads and clogged pores, I had very little in the way of breakouts while using it, and any breakouts I did have didn‚Äôt leave behind marks. My skin felt so smooth and soft and happy!
It‚Äôs packed with ingredients like Niacinamide (anti bacterial and anti inflammatory), Salicylic Acid (exfoliate skin and helps to unclog pores) and Linoleic Acid (helps prevent breakouts and improve the quality of sebum produced by the skin).
NEED to repurchase. My skin just looked so much better while using it.

Pixi Rose Ceramide Cream*
This is one of my newer skincare products, as I received it earlier this year.
Ceramides are incredibly important in skincare products, particularly when it comes to drier, colder weather. They help to form the skin‚Äôs barrier and maintain the skin retain moisture, as well as protect against environmental aggressors.
This Rose Ceramide Cream from Pixi is an intensive moisturiser packed with ceramides, rose oil and probiotics to provide deeper hydration while ensuring the barrier is comfortable and happy. It has the most divine, delicate fragrance that makes it feel super luxurious too. Even though the formula is super rich, it doesn‚Äôt feel greasy or sticky at all. It sinks in, yet the feeling of comfort and nourishment lasts.
I can feel my skin thanking me each time I use this, and when it‚Äôs finished I‚Äôll most definitely have to replace it. I started out using it at night while the weather was warmer, and will most probably continue to do so, however as the weather gets drier I‚Äôll possibly reach for it on days when my skin feels tight.
You can purchase this in South Africa from Betty online HERE or Muse Beauty HERE. I just hope that their stocks will last long enough for me to buy a new tube!
Previously mentioned in my February and March Favourites I did as an Instagram Live.
Elizabeth Arden Eight Hour Great 8 Daily Defense Moisturiser*
I love a good multi-tasking product, something that has many different benefits in one easy tube like this one!
When I saw that Elizabeth Arden had released this moisturiser (I first heard about it from Fleur de Force‚Äôs YouTube channel before it even landed here in SA), I KNEW I‚Äôd have to try it. It promises 8 benefits ‚Äì protects against sunlight, blue light, infrared and pollution, plus it hydrates, it purifies, it brightens skin and fights excess oil production. I mean, it almost sounds too good to be true, right??
I have combination skin, so I need something that will help control oil, yet still hydrate my skin. This moisturiser does both of these with the most beautiful silky texture. The more I use it, the clearer and brighter my skin looks too! I love that it protects my skin from all sorts of environmental damage, as well as sun damage, and damage from too much screen time (we all know I‚Äôm constantly on my phone). Not only this, but it has a kind of translucent, pale creamy colour to it, so it leaves ZERO white caste, and it doesn‚Äôt leave a sticky residue on the skin either.
Another bonus ‚Äì it works almost like a primer too, as makeup glides effortlessly over the top.
Great 8? I think so!
Optiphi Complexion Control*
This is probably one of (if not THE) star product find of 2019. Optiphi just GETS me. Honestly. They can do no wrong in my eyes!
I have a full blog post dedicated to a review of this (you‚Äôll find it below), so I don‚Äôt want to waffle on too much, but I have NEVER seen such impressive results from one product. I battle with both melasma (hormonal pigmentation from years on the pill, and various periods of hormonal fluctuation due to aggressive treatments for my endometriosis) and post inflammatory hyperpigmentation.
Not only has this drastically reduced the size and darkness of my hormonal pigmentation (the bigger, paler patches have either disappeared or are much smaller, and the darker, smaller patches are very much faded), it‚Äôs also improved my post inflammatory hyperpigmentation (marks left behind have faded away to nothing or have faded dramatically, and it‚Äôs improved marks left behind from breakouts while I used the moisturiser ‚Äì in fact I feel like my breakouts now don‚Äôt leave behind such intense marks either).
While I was using it (and I didn‚Äôt use it daily, either every second or third night, so the container lasted me over 5 months easily), my skin also looked overall healthier, glowier, more even in both tone and texture, and brighter. Fine lines were plumped and you would barely see a line around my eyes. The fine lines in my forehead and from smiling around my mouth were softer.
I know a lot of people battle justifying a bigger spend like this, but if it‚Äôs something that interests you, please read my full post as I have before and after pictures that have not been edited and have no filters whatsoever. You‚Äôll see the proof in the pudding there. I plan on budgeting and putting money aside to buy this product every 6 months, to fade any pigmentation remaining even more, and keep my skin looking the way it did while I used it.

September & October Favourites 2019
Optiphi Complexion Control (a whole post dedicated to a full review)
Filorga Time-Filler Night*
As you can see in the mentions below, I used this for a while, then stopped for some reason, then started using it again. You can tell from that break in between that I truly did see just how good it is! That I could genuinely see a change in my skin when I was using it.
The Time-Filler Night is designed to target multiple types of wrinkles, including dehydration wrinkles, surface wrinkles, contraction wrinkles (from facial expressions, and if you‚Äôve watched my videos before, you‚Äôll know I have an expressive face) and deeper wrinkles. It even promises to help with lines caused by sleeping hard on your pillow case (although we know I don‚Äôt get as many of these thanks to my beautiful Dear Deer satin pillow slips, but I sometimes sleep on my arm or hand) and puffiness when you wake up.
The biggest difference I found was that I didn‚Äôt have lines on my face from sleeping (from either lying on my pillowcase or my hand. My face wasn‚Äôt as puffy either. I also noticed dehydration lines didn‚Äôt exist while I used this, and those pesky lines in my forehead and between my eyes, as well as around either side of my mouth were much softer and less noticeable.
On top of this, I loved the gel-cream texture. One would think that something that is so powerfully anti-ageing would be a rich, oily consisitency, but it‚Äôs lightweight and sinks into the skin beautifully. Absolutely incredible for those of us looking for great anti-ageing products, but worried that they‚Äôll cause our combination/oily skins to break out or look/feel like an oil slick.
Truly a good night‚Äôs sleep in a jar!

Dr Dermal MicroRetinal 5 Rich Repair*
It has been a LONG time since I spoke about this goodie from Dr Dermal. In fact, it‚Äôs been some time since I mentioned the brand in general! Not due to falling out of love with it, just with the influx of so many other brands and new products to try.
This is an incredibly gentle retinol treatment (in my eyes at least, and I have sensitive skin) that honestly didn‚Äôt give me any of the flaky, red irritation that retinol is known for. Instead it left me with soft, plumped skin the morning after use!
The formula contains 5% microencapsulated retinol, but has a controlled time release to it, so even though it‚Äôs very high strength-wise, it will gradually be released, allowing your skin to absorb what it needs. With the inclusion of ceramides and peptides, it‚Äôs a lovely nourishing night-time treat for your skin!

What is your favourite moisturiser? I know there are so many I have on my list to try, and a couple that I‚Äôve only just started using.
*DISCLAIMER ‚Äì while some of these products were PR gifts, all opinions are, as always, honest and my own.

"The cost continues to go down" Friedman said, adding that energy can be produced nearly every day of the year in the northeast from current generation photovoltaic cells. Once the initial investment is made in solar, wind or water technologies, energy is free from that time onward, Friedman said.Mr. Emanuel has been leading the effort to help young people find engaging and educational programs that keep them off the streets and out of trouble. Youth violence is not Chicago's problem alone, but Mr. Emanuel focused on the issue here after some high-profile shootings put an ugly spotlight on the city.
He didn't reach out to Ms. Obama but said he's happy for her support.
‚ÄúHer staff read about it and they called and said, 'We love what you're doing and can we help?' ‚Äù Mr. Emanuel told me in a phone interview yesterday. Today's event, he said, ‚Äúis a way she can highlight the issue. This isn't about youth violence but youth opportunity.‚Äù
The effort to raise an astounding $50 million is led by Mr. Wilson and Mr. Reynolds.
They are men with big titles and influence that reaches deep into the business community, though Mr. Emanuel is the driving force behind much of the fundraising. "I'm the mayor and someone has to get it done," he said of returning to fundraising, a skill that he mastered in politics.
Companies are stepping up, and he and Ms. Obama are hoping individuals do, too, he said.
So far, Mark Walter, who heads Guggenheim Partners LLC, has donated, as has Mr. Reynolds, who has given $1 million.
Mr. Emanuel wants the fundraising to have a lasting impact, so a $5 million donation will be spread out over five years, at $1 million annually.
‚ÄúI want to make sure we have resources available (over the long haul) and not just for a one-year program,‚Äù he said. "We want kids to realize their potential."London-based producer Jack Beech takes the reins on his own project EP ‚ÄòNoctilucent‚Äô and its lead single ‚ÄòBlue Hour‚Äô.
Having spent years working with other artists in his native Manchester, Jack moved to London expanding both his networks and experience ‚Äì including assisting award-winning composer Walter Mair and mixing music for Christian Heschl. Continuing to work as an engineer, producing and composing music across a variety of media ‚Äì the idea of creating solo work peaked in this last difficult year with the artist himself experiencing the illness of Covid-19. But through adversity, creativity glistens.
The multi-instrumentalist truly utilises all tools at his disposal in this piece (exceeding just over the three minute mark) through a mixture of soundscapes and textures giving a cinematic depth to the track.
Sparked by woozy synths and echoing percussion ‚Äì the opening gives the feeling of a dream-like state. There‚Äôs a slow build as flourishing piano notes and bittersweet strings are added. These are gradually followed by more electronic effects at varying speeds. This build and layering of instruments creates a rich and full sound to the track, which is then stripped back towards the end leaving keys and strings to take centre stage.
Particularly in a year of uncertainty, there‚Äôs a real quality of enlightenment that comes through ‚Äì the word ‚Äònoctilucent‚Äô itself meaning ‚Äúshining at night‚Äù. This composition paints that moment of epiphany after dark times. Of ‚Äúhaving full clarity in a perfect moment‚Äù Beech explains.
Uplifting and euphoric, yet with a strong sense of calm. ‚ÄòBlue Hour‚Äô is that twilight period, that stepping stone of anticipation and (to throw another idiom in there) perhaps the light at the end of the tunnel we‚Äôve been waiting for.These retreats equal almost 6 eggs of conventional therapy held over a general.

John Boehner (R-OH) steps down at the end of the month.
In April of this year Flame released a video announcing his intention to run for president, but has now set his sights on the speakership.
‚ÄúEver since I was a kid, I wanted to be a rapper,‚Äù he explained, ‚Äúbut it was always means to the end, you see? My real dream was to run Congress.‚Äù
The fact that he is not currently an elected officeholder doesn‚Äôt matter. Any American citizen who qualifies can serve as House Speaker.

The coastal villages of Bordi and Gholvad in Dahanu taluk of Palghar district in Maharashtra are the epicentre of chikoo cultivation in India. Chikoos from here are unique and the Gholvad chikoo was awarded a Geographical Indicator (GI) tag two years ago.
For the longest time, growers have been reconciled to getting whatever they are given when their chikoos are sold at the Vashi wholesale market in Navi Mumbai. Middlemen have called the shots. But with value addition and the setting up of the parlours, growers hope to reorder an unfair arrangement and make chikoo cultivation more profitable.
The first Chikoo Parlour, with the tagline, Sabh Kuch Chikoo, came up in Bordi in September 2016. The second one in Haloli is on NH-8 which connects Ahmedabad and Mumbai. The third and fourth are at a two-km distance from each other on the Mumbai-Nashik highway, in Vasind and Asangaon, respectively. None of the Chikoo Parlours is in crowded city markets, but along thinly populated highways. They attract people driving past.
‚ÄúWe aren‚Äôt into mass production. We produce for the masses,‚Äù says Mahesh Parshram Churi, 65, who has invested in the Chikoo Parlour idea and grown it as a business. ‚ÄúWe wanted to show farmers a new way of augmenting their income.‚Äù
There are about 800 chikoo families of growers in Bordi and Gholvad who own an average of five acres of chikoo orchards. Churi has five acres of his own.
Siddharth Patel, a farmer and entrepreneur in Bordi, says at least 15 to 20 tonnes of chikoo travel to Vashi market in Navi Mumbai for about half the year. Since the fruit has a very short shelf life ‚Äî about two or three days ‚Äî farmers are compelled to offload it quickly. They get paid between Rs 8 and Rs 20 per kg though in Mumbai chikoo sells for around Rs 40 per kg.
Churi is an electrical engineer. He shifted to Mumbai but because of his love for his village, he set up Sumo Instruments, an electronics manufacturing industry which makes measuring instruments, in Bordi. Although he earned well from his business, he wanted chikoo cultivation to prosper because it was the mainstay of people in Bordi.
‚ÄúWe want to make Bordi an icon for chikoo products,‚Äù says Churi.
The chikoo-growing villages have shown determination to free themselves from the clutches of middlemen. Churi‚Äôs and a few parallel ventures are sure to take the chikoo‚Äôs fortunes to new heights.
For many years farmer families in Bordi and Gholvad made chikoo chips, powder and pickle, and sold them to tourists. They are now being encouraged to improve quality and move up the value chain.
Siddharth Patil, 32, has 23 acres of chikoo and a seven-acre mango orchard. He has invested Rs 1 crore and set up an agro-industry called Aryas Foods.
And Hillzill which makes a range of fruit wines also manufactures a chikoo wine, the only one of its kind in the world.
THE CHIKOO TRAIL
The chikoo tree is native to Mexico, Central America and the Caribbean islands. In English, it is called mud apple, nose berry and sapodilla (Manilkara zapota). Its other Indian name is sapota. Chikoo is a major commercial crop in India, Sri Lanka, Indonesia and Malaysia. The tree is fast-growing and resistant to drought or strong winds. It flourishes well even in dry, arid regions.
It was Sir Dinshaw Maneckji Petit, a Parsi textile magnate, who first imported chikoo plants into India and planted them in his garden in Mumbai. In 1901, his estate manager, Ardeshir Irani, took some seedlings to Bordi, 130 km from Mumbai, and sowed them in his one-acre plot in the village. The chikoo plants thrived and became the main crop of the entire Dahanu taluk.
According to the horticulture department‚Äôs figures, the total productive area under chikoo cultivation in Dahanu taluk is 3,850 hectares and the annual yield is 120,312 tonnes.
Traditionally, farmer families have been turning chikoo into chips, powder and pickle. But they would use considerable sugar for the powder, had poor production standards and there was no proper packaging to speak of.
Churi thought converting chikoo into powder of high quality without added sugar would increase its marketability. This would attract the health-conscious customer.
‚ÄúWe did all the experimentation with chikoo, using the profits from our electronic products company in Bordi,‚Äù recalls Mohak Churi, Mahesh‚Äôs eldest son. They took samples of the powder to Mumbai and Pune, hoping it would be well-received. The response was lukewarm and they ended up with a loss of Rs 1 lakh to Rs 2 lakh.
But Churi didn‚Äôt give up. He reckoned that the dehydrated powder was a new product that people didn‚Äôt know of. So why would they buy it? Instead of trying to sell chikoo powder, if they could create finished products with it they would attract consumers and local people would see the possibilities of value addition.
It was then that the idea of the Chikoo Parlour came to Churi. Two of his relatives, Deepak Save and Sandeep Save, were in the catering business. They advised him to invent a range of chikoo sweets. Churi brought in a sweet-making expert, Hari, from Mathura.
After much experimentation, about a dozen chikoo delicacies were developed: chikoo roll, chikoo katri, chikoo roll cut, chikoo peda, chikoo double decker, chikoo kandi peda, chikoo mahim halwa, and so on. Samples were distributed among relatives who appreciated them.
A chikoo factory was set up near Sumo Instruments in Bordi. Mahesh‚Äôs younger son, Subak Churi, 28, and nephew, Pranit Raut, 38, look after raw material procurement and production. Subak has a management degree and Raut is an automobile engineer who has been working at Sumo Instruments for the past 15 years.
The chikoo powder, the base material for all chikoo products, has no added sugar, artificial flavours or preservatives. The sweets, which have a shelf life of six to 45 days, have added sugar, but no artificial flavours or preservatives. The halwas can be kept for one and a half months. Prices range from Rs 800 to Rs 1,200 per kg.
‚ÄúTo serve sweets as fresh as possible, we make them every two days and supply them to all our outlets,‚Äù says Subak.
Chikoo is available almost throughout the year at Bordi. But there are two important seasons. The first is from December to March and the second from May to July. Chikoo Parlour products are made from ripened fruits which fall to the ground. Schoolchildren collect the fruits and bring them to the company‚Äôs processing unit. ‚ÄúWe pay a consistent rate of Rs 13 to 15 per kg while in the local market the price fluctuates from Rs 5 to Rs 20,‚Äù says Churi.
Chikoo powder is made during the fruit‚Äôs best season which is from December to March. The factory processes 300 kg of ripe fruit every day. Twenty to 30 tribal women are engaged in the pre-processing process of cutting and drying the fruit.
Chikoo is manually cut into slices and then dried in small solar driers. The fruit is not peeled. ‚ÄúPeeling is a laborious process. Besides, the skin has many nutrients,‚Äù says Mohak. The company has made its own chikoo powdering machines. Dehydrated slices have to be ground two to three times to get dry powder.
The women are paid Rs 10 per kg for slicing. They work from 9 am to 12 noon or 2 pm, depending on the workload. Each woman slices on average about 20 kg of chikoo. Manual slicing is preferred because the slices are evenly cut, says Mohak. About 100 kg of fresh fruit produces 20 kg of powder in five days.
The finished chikoo powder (they call this granulated powder chikoo rawa) is sold for Rs 1,000 per kg and has a shelf life of six months. If packed properly, it can last more than a year, but six months is safer.
The chikoo kaju roll, which sells about 100 kg a month, is the most popular product. The second is the double decker burfi made with buffalo milk. Chikoo powder, chikoo milkshake powder and chikoo pickle (chunda) are also popular. Chunda is most popular in Gujarat. Churi‚Äôs Chikoo Parlour‚Äôs chikoo chunda is available in both sweet and spicy forms. All these products can be kept for six months.

A FAMILY AFFAIR
The Chikoo Parlour business is a family business. Mahesh and Mohak look after marketing from their head office at Borivili in Mumbai. Subak and Raut manage production at the Bordi factory. Mahesh‚Äôs wife, Ratnamala, helps in managing their stall at chikoo fests. Mohak‚Äôs wife, Pranjal, takes care of digital publicity, including their Facebook page.
‚ÄúThe mithai business, like the milk business, needs constant attention to detail,‚Äù says Mohak. Mahesh monitors distribution but a heart problem he developed at the young age of 49 means he cannot exert too much.
The enterprise doesn‚Äôt have many unsold products. ‚ÄúWe always produce as per requirement. We have software which gives us complete data of sales and stocks so we take decisions accordingly,‚Äù says Mohak. ‚ÄúEvery parlour has a staff of two or three people and is fitted with CCTVs. From our Mumbai office, we can monitor every detail and track a batch of products if there is a complaint.‚Äù
Most customers opt for the chikoo milkshake and then try some of the sweets. The Chikoo Parlour on the highway between Ahmedabad and Mumbai attracts Gujaratis who are known to be fond of sweets. In fact, 70 percent of customers buy the takeaway pack, says Mohak.
‚ÄúWe haven‚Äôt spent a single rupee on media or advertisement so far,‚Äù says Mahesh. ‚ÄúWe don‚Äôt mind slow growth. Instead of spending on advertisements, we have tried to strengthen our products, their quality and packing. This way, by word of mouth, we are sure we will enlarge our business.‚Äù
CHIKOO FESTIVAL
Since 2013, Bordi has been holding an annual two-day Chikoo Festival in the last week of January or in early February. This year, the festival had 250 stalls. The stall fee is between Rs 10,000 and Rs 14,000. ‚ÄúYet, all stalls were booked within a few hours,‚Äù says Prabhakar Save, 70, founder and former president of the Konkan Bhumi Agri-Tourism Cooperative Society which organises the festival with the Department of Tourism. This year the festival attracted 140,000 visitors from Mumbai, Pune, Nashik and towns in Gujarat, and earned revenue of Rs 1.7 crore over two days.
The Chikoo Parlour stall at the festival notched up sales of Rs 7 lakh. The festival has helped the parlour establish its identity and promote its products.
The Churis have also been trying to promote their products globally and across India. NRIs in the US, for instance, buy the chikoo powder and take it back. The Chikoo Parlour gets orders from Mumbai, Hyderabad, Delhi and other cities. The products are packed and sent through courier.
Chikoo fruit is available in Mumbai through the year. Generally chikoo milkshake is made with fresh chikoo. There is a slight difference in taste between milkshake made with fresh fruit and milkshake made with chikoo powder.
‚ÄúMilkshake made with fresh fruit is watery. To thicken it, ice-cream parlours add custard powder. But with chikoo powder, you get thick milkshake that is more authentic in taste,‚Äù says Mohak.
‚ÄúWe had developed some 40 chikoo products. Eventually we selected only 25 because some would have had a very short shelf life and others would be expensive to make,‚Äù says Raut.
The company has been steadily increasing production of chikoo rawa over the years. In 2016-17, one tonne of rawa was produced. The very next year production rose to five tonnes. During this chikoo season as much as 10 tonnes was produced and the company‚Äôs turnover touched Rs 1 crore.
‚ÄúThe Western Ghats coastal region could pioneer value addition in chikoo, mango, coconut, jackfruit, kokum, cashew apple and karonda,‚Äù says Shirodkar and adds that his foundation would be happy to offer incentives to such enterprises.
‚ÄúWe farmers must realise that selling fresh fruit gives us a limited income. The market for seasonal fruits is erratic and drops during a bumper crop. A large part of the crop must be converted into value-added products. These could be promoted also as health foods and nutraceuticals,‚Äù remarks Ajit Shirodkar, chairman, Western Ghats Kokum Foundation.Agricultural scientists are upbeat about Churi‚Äôs enterprise and see this as an example of how farmer incomes can be increased.
Dr K.P. Vishwanatha, vice-chancellor, Dr Balasaheb Sawant Konkan Krishi Vidyapeeth, Dapoli, has offered all technical help to the Churis for processing and value addition for chikoo and other fruits.
‚ÄúMahesh Churi‚Äôs enterprise offers new hope for farmers ‚Äî fruits get value addition, local employment is created and a new agro-business comes up,‚Äù says Dr Vishwanatha. ‚ÄúThe addition of tourism and events like the Chikoo Festival has to be applauded.‚Äù
The Churi family has plans to diversify into more fruits. They are experimenting with guava and sitaphal (custard apple), making new products with the two fruits and giving them to relatives to taste. Their dream is to make the village of Bordi a tourist destination known for chikoo products.

The University of Manchester, the University of Salford and Manchester Metropolitan University, working with CriticalArc, have created the Manchester SafeZone Alliance. A global first, the initiative enables the three security control rooms to extend the footprint of 24/7 support beyond their campus boundaries.
The partnership builds on Manchester‚Äôs and Salford‚Äôs reputations as safe and welcoming cities for students from across the UK and a favourite destination for international students.
The three individual universities have already deployed SafeZone within their own institutions. Now, with the formation of the Manchester SafeZone Alliance, security staff from each campus will provide reciprocal support to each other‚Äôs staff and students.
In the event of an emergency - including an accident, crime, or medical incident - help is available to SafeZone users at the press of a button. Using the SafeZone app on their phone, students and staff are directly connected to the appropriate safety and security team or first responder.
For example, if a University of Manchester student is walking home alone late at night through the Manchester Metropolitan University campus, that individual will have the peace of mind that dedicated university first responder teams are instantly accessible at the tap of a button via SafeZone, confirming who needs assistance, their precise location, and the type of incident. The nearest first responders will be notified and dispatched to the scene to provide an efficient response. Only when an individual calls for help, is the identity and location of that person shared with the university‚Äôs security team.
‚ÄúStudent and staff wellbeing is always the top priority for all three universities and we are pleased to put in place a technology solution that furthers this shared aim. Manchester and Salford have a long-standing reputation for being inclusive and welcoming destinations for students from around the world.‚Äù said Dr Sam Grogan, Pro-Vice Chancellor for Student Experience at University of Salford on behalf of the universities associated with the Manchester SafeZone Alliance group. ‚ÄúThis pioneering cross-city initiative serves to enhance the safety and wellbeing of our university community.‚Äù
Darren Chalmers-Stevens, Managing Director of CriticalArc, said the introduction of the first SafeZone Alliance furthered CriticalArc‚Äôs strategic objective to help customers extend safety and security across their wider communities to enhance the protection of millions of SafeZone users.
‚ÄúWe are delighted to be working with the University of Manchester, Manchester Metropolitan University and University of Salford on this ground-breaking project to give added reassurance for thousands of students and staff. The SafeZone Alliance sets these Greater Manchester universities apart and demonstrates their commitment to the wellbeing of students and staff, beyond traditional, individual campus boundaries. We believe this alliance will prove to be a catalyst for game-changing cooperation between universities around the world.‚ÄùBali Peak Travel Season

0 Response to "Bali Peak Travel Season"Ford has been busy sending filings to the United States Patent and Trademark Office. On July 25, the company filed two trademarks for the upcoming Bronco SUV to claim the "Bronco Outer Banks" and "Bronco Big Bend" names.
Motor1 first discovered the Big Bend trademark, while Ford Authority uncovered the Outer Banks filing, and both sites reported on them on Tuesday. The names sound like special editions or option packages to us. While these two filings are associated specifically with "land motor vehicles," a third trademark for "Bronco Sport" was filed on July 10. This filing, however, was named for "land motor vehicle parts" and mentioned "shock absorbers," "seat trim," and various badges. Again, this could be a package Ford plans to offer.

Aside from the various trademarks, Ford has also moved to patent a number of features that could potentially see grace the rugged SUV. They include removable doors and a retractable cloth roof. The latter is said to work two ways with the ability to create a makeshift canopy of sorts.

The new Bronco will ride on the Ford Ranger pickup's platform and be built in the U.S. Rumors have pegged a hybrid option and a 7-speed manual transmission as part of the reborn Bronco, but we can't confirm the news. Additionally, an auto parts store seemed to out the Bronco's base engine: the Ranger's 2.3-liter turbo-4.
The Bronco, expected as a 2021 model, will likely bow sometime next year, possibly at the revamped North American International Auto Show next June. After the reveal, expect the focus to shift on the rumored Bronco pickup truck.Description

It may carry signifiers of your ethnic background, which you wouldn‚Äôt want to lose while pursuing a rhinoplasty. Ethnic rhinoplasty refers to nose jobs that allow you to transform your facial features, modify the shape, size, or symmetry of your nose while still retaining your identity.
If you‚Äôre pursuing an ethnic rhinoplasty in NYC, you must find a surgeon with a strong understanding of the differences between the facial features of different ethnic groups. They must understand how to carve and create contours that align with your overall facial features and give you a balanced look without resorting to a eurocentric template. This is especially important for patients of Hispanic, Middle Eastern, African, and Asian ethnic backgrounds.
New York Group for Plastic Surgery is one of the premier plastic surgery centers in New York, with offices in Westchester and Orange County. Our surgeons have decades of combined experience serving patients of various ethnic backgrounds, and they‚Äôre often visited by patients from across the globe.

By Kapil Bhatia, Avinash Pathengay and Manav KheraI recently found myself entrenched on a familiar battlefield. After making what I thought was an innocuous statement about needing more texts that my AP Literature students would enjoy reading that would also represent ‚Äúliterary merit,‚Äù and noting some contemporary texts that would meet these criteria, another teacher began to lecture me on the necessity of requiring students to read canonical British literature.
Her unyielding tirade provided some insight into what it must feel like to be a student in that class ‚Äì in which choice is something the teacher makes, books are taught (not students), and the teacher is the sole purveyor of knowledge.
Before I continue, let me say that I truly believe that this teacher truly believes that she is doing what is best for her students. Her primary argument, in fact, was that we are doing our students a disservice if we do not expect them to read ‚Äúhard texts.‚Äù
To her, rigor means old. She explained that if students are not struggling to decode classic books such as Beowulf or Cantebury Tales, they are not being challenged enough. She said that any book they read that‚Äôs not canon is a waste of their time.
But herein lies the rub: many students from different English classes eat lunch in my classroom, and I listen to their honest conversations about school. I watch as they use Sparknotes to fill out question packets on classic texts. When the focus is on a specific book, and the assessments are designed to elicit responses about the plot, students do not have much incentive to read the book. Thus, they find answers they need online and wait for the teacher to tell them what they should have learned from the text.
While I held back from sharing such observations, I did agree that students benefit from reading challenging texts. MRIs have recorded all of the brilliant ways the brain lights up with activity when reading the works of Shakespeare! However, I offered the suggestion that students need not read full novels as a whole class to receive this benefit. I often pull excerpts from classic texts to analyze in class so that the focus is on the writing craft and on ourselves as readers. We explore passages in depth to build reader confidence, look for literary devices and discuss their functions, and connect to theme. I provide them with incentive to read other than ‚Äúbecause it‚Äôs tradition,‚Äù and ‚Äì more importantly ‚Äì I encourage them to find their own reasons for connecting to texts.
Amy Rasmussen and I have engaged in numerous conversations about the magic that happens when students choose the books they read for our AP English classes. Sure, students will often choose a contemporary text if given the chance because it‚Äôs easier for them to read and it seems more relevant to them. What‚Äôs wrong with that? Books like The Kite Runner and Never Let Me Go have been referenced by the College Board on the AP Literature and Composition exam¬Æ, so why do some teachers still cling to the classics as if nothing written after the turn of the 20th century has merit?.
Many of us speak and write about the benefits of a workshop classroom, and the idea of choice in reading has been explored by leaders in education such as Kelly Gallagher and Penny Kittle. So why are some teachers so afraid to let go of their perceived control? What do they think will happen if a student walks out of high school without reading Beowulf? I would rather see my students leave my classroom having read several books they chose to read than having faked their way through a list of classics, and based on the honest feedback I get from my students, they prefer it this way, too.
I left the battle of the canon feeling that we had reached a stalemate. Until I can convince nonbelievers of the benefits of choice in the AP classroom, I will continue to provide a safe space for any students to come in and talk about books, even as some Sparknote and Google their way through the classics..
[‚Ä¶] looking for more support for your reading choices, check out these posts by Amber Counts here and here. And these by Amy Rasmussen here and [‚Ä¶]
[‚Ä¶] The Battle of the Canon by Amber Counts from Three Teachers Talk created a little bristle in me at first, but then reading further I understand her opinion. Student choice is valuable. [‚Ä¶]
Why not spend a little time reading and enjoying ‚ÄúMacbeth?‚Äù The story and characters are interesting‚Ä¶do not dissect it so much‚Ä¶it wrings out the juice.

Thanks for saying this. It‚Äôs honest and real.
confirmation bias aside, your thoughts and suggestions warm my soul as I sit here seething b/c a Sr. colleague publicly shamed other colleagues for not teaching Shakespeare. Is it really rigorous if they spend most of their time decoding and the rest piecing together insights from various websites and essays written on the text since? Isn‚Äôt it oppressive and ethnocentric to suggest the canon i.e. British lit is what counts for literary merit?
I just had this conversation with a reader in our FB group. If we will remember we are literacy teachers, not literature teachers, the focus shifts from the text to the needs of the readers. I am all for British lit when we use it to advance readers who can read and think about it in the way its complexity demands; however, in my experience, students shut down, turn away, and some even shudder at the mention of Shakespeare. We do more harm than good when we force feed the bard. And I agree with you about the ridiculous idea that the canon is what counts for literary merit. Come on, people, read a little, will ya? Some of the literature written in the last few decades puts some of those books to shame ‚Äî in my humble opinion, of course. üôÇ
Tell the plot as a story‚Ä¶use important scenes for study‚Ä¶do not reveal spoilers!
They do not read those texts. They fake read. I also watch them copy each other‚Äôs AP Homework from other classes. Many kids take 3 or 4 college level courses and can‚Äôt keep up with he workload.
In addition to choice I find we must give them time to read in class- also something very unpopular. But without the time they slip. The time is crucial along with book talks and conferences. You can‚Äôt convince everyone- just keep going . I‚Äôm sure students have read more this year in your class than at any other point in high school.

I always wondered why we were dragged through the classics. Why not study a few scenes to whet the appetite? Miss Haversham instead of the entire ‚ÄúGreat Expectorations.‚Äù (as we called it back in the day.)

Miss Haversham is my favorite character ever! She, however, is not my students‚Äô favorite. And that‚Äôs what matters most!
I completely agree with you. However, I struggle to make the plan make sense in my head. I wonder about how I can use a book in short snippets without losing the plot. I would love to see a sample unit plan or lesson plan that takes a core text and connects it to the students‚Äô choice reading.Cooper, Jennifer

The existence of the NBC Olympics Twitter account is evidence of this, but the account seems totally misused in this case: NBC live tweeted the whole ceremony, with no apparent sense of irony around the fact that its target audience couldn‚Äôt actually watch the events it was describing. Instead of building excitement around the ceremony, and engaging with its viewers, all NBC ended up doing was frustrating its audience ‚Äî the people who care most about watching the thing.
So really, how bad was NBC‚Äôs strategy around the U.S. broadcast of the 2012 Olympics Opening Ceremony in London? So bad that Mark Benioff, chairman and CEO of Salesforce.com, and someone who should really fucking know better, tweeted out a link to a pirated live stream of the ceremony taking place in London. (Ironically enough, he was tweeting about the appearance of Sir Tim Berners-Lee, creator of the World Wide Web, that magical thing which made the pirate stream available to the rest of us.)
Think about that for a second ‚Äî you‚Äôve got a titan of industry telling viewers to ignore the local broadcast rights and pay attention to an illegal copy of the event instead. Telling viewers not to worry about waiting for the taped broadcast, that this is something you should be watching right fucking now, and damn NBC if they‚Äôre not making the stream available and someone else is. The big lesson here is that if people care enough about finding a certain piece of content and watching it ‚Äî live or otherwise ‚Äî they probably will.
The sad thing is that NBC probably could have had things both ways ‚Äî it could have live streamed and broadcast for the work-time crowd and those kicking it at home, and still had people show up for a re-broadcast after work, if they couldn‚Äôt watch live. This is a lesson that we thought NBC had learned from the 2008 Olympic games, when it held back live streams of the games for events that would be later broadcast on tape delay. To its credit, NBC is live streaming most competitions, even when the broadcast of those events will happen later. But for whatever reason, that lesson wasn‚Äôt applied to the opening ceremony.
No doubt NBC made the decision not to broadcast the ceremony live because it was worried it would lose some of the primetime audience ‚Äî after all, people are more likely to show up and watch something at 8:00 PM than mid-day on a Friday. It had advertisers who paid big money to show up against the event, and it didn‚Äôt want to piss them off by running the ceremony early, when people were at work and would only be half-paying attention. Maybe it thought that if it broadcast the ceremony live there wouldn‚Äôt be a primetime audience.
So here‚Äôs an idea for NBC in the future, especially when it tackles the 2014 Winter Olympics in Sochi, Russia: Forget about the tape delay. Or sure, show the ceremony in primetime, but also show it live while it‚Äôs happening. Those who care enough to get up and watch the thing at 6:00 am will do so ‚Äî and the rest of the audience will show up in the primetime hours, just as they always have. And then your twitter stream won‚Äôt look so stupid and embarrassing and frustrating for those who actually want to see what you‚Äôre tweeting about.DENVER ‚Äì A death investigation is underway after body was found in the South Platte River in Denver Wednesday afternoon.

Tue., Feb. 21, 2017
OLYMPIA ‚Äì Although Washington lawmakers are expected eventually to approve a budget that will spend billions more on education, some public school officials said they may have to write plans for the 2017-18 school year that cut spending and notify some teachers they could be laid off.
The problem revolves around timing: Some school districts are already preparing their budgets for the coming year, but the Legislature may be months away from a deal on the court-ordered overhaul of the way the state raises money and pays for public education.
The House of Representatives is scheduled to vote Wednesday on one set of reforms, which is significantly different than a plan that Senate Republicans moved through that chamber late last month.
With months of negotiations ahead, Gov. Jay Inslee and some Democratic lawmakers say the Legislature should make an immediate change in state law to guarantee districts won‚Äôt have less money from property taxes than they have this year. They want the Senate to pass a separate bill already approved by the House that provides a one-year delay to a scheduled reduction in most districts‚Äô levy rates.
But Republicans argue that the threat of this drop in property tax money, generally called the ‚Äúlevy cliff,‚Äù is needed to make sure the Legislature follows through on the last round of changes to the school system that were ordered by the state Supreme Court in 2012.
Without the pressure of the levy cliff, lawmakers might ‚Äútake their foot off the gas pedal as far as solving the actual problem,‚Äù House Minority Leader Dan Kristiansen, R-Snohomish, said Monday.
‚ÄúThe bill just postpones the problem,‚Äù Kristiansen said of the one-year delay. ‚ÄúIt just kicks the can down the road. Why would we do that?‚Äù
Senate Majority Leader Mark Schoesler, R-Ritzville, agreed: ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt think we‚Äôve come to the levy cliff yet.‚Äù
At a press conference attended by four school superintendents Tuesday, Inslee scoffed at the idea the Legislature needs more pressure to reach a deal on school reform. The state is already under a contempt order from the court, which comes with a $100,000-per-day penalty. The Legislature hasn‚Äôt actually set aside money for the fine, or created a fund to hold it, but the Office of Financial Management does keep track of the amount owed, now about $56 million.
‚ÄúHow much more pressure do you need?‚Äù Inslee asked at the press conference. ‚ÄúThat dog won‚Äôt hunt.‚Äù
School superintendents from Seattle, Federal Way, Lake Washington and Sunnyside said they were faced with the prospect of writing two budgets ‚Äì one that assumes it will have the money provided by the extra property taxing authority, whether it comes from the local levy or state taxes; and one without the money that extra authority provides. The amount varies around the state, with Seatte Superintendent Larry Nyland estimating the latter budget will be about $30 million lower and Sunnyside Superintendent Kevin McKay saying his would be about $2 million less.
If the Legislature doesn‚Äôt pass an extension to the levy cliff by next Tuesday, Seattle Public Schools must by law begin the process of determining which teachers would get layoff notices, Nyland said. Sunnyside would start that process sometime in mid-March.
Spokane Public Schools will not write two budgets while it waits to see how the Legislature will overhaul school policy, Superintendent Shelley Redinger said. Instead it will write one budget and if the district‚Äôs levy authority drops without an increase from the state, it will pay for the difference out of reserves rather than notify teachers of possible layoffs.
But that‚Äôs not the ideal situation, Redinger added.
Medical Lake School Superintendent Timothy Ames said that district hasn‚Äôt reached the point of having to write two budgets yet, and its property tax levy is small enough part of its total revenue it can afford to watch, and wait. They‚Äôll have to know about layoffs by May 1, to send out notices by May 15.
‚ÄúWe‚Äôre small enough to respond quickly,‚Äù Ames said. Legislators have given the district practice at that in recent years because they‚Äôve regularly needed extra time to agree to the state budget that covers public.Enforce leash laws
On a recent visit to the trails in Mission Oaks Park I was astonished by the number of off-leash dogs running along the trails. This upset me for two reasons: off-leash dogs can be a nuisance and safety hazard to leashed dogs; moreover, the Department of Parks and Recreation already has dog parks in our community.
Usually, when an off-leash dog runs up to my dog, the owner says something like ‚ÄúHe‚Äôs nice.‚Äù My dog is nice too.
But I want you to imagine this situation from a human perspective. Imagine you are out for a walk and a stranger starts running up to you. They get right up in your face and start introducing themselves. They grab your arm and shake your hand. You back up, they get right back in your face. Are you uncomfortable yet? Have you thought, ‚ÄúThis person is crazy they might hurt me?‚Äù
When your unleashed dog runs up at mine that‚Äôs what goes through her head. My dog is on a leash ‚Äî she can‚Äôt run away. She feels trapped. If she bites your dog, it‚Äôs out of fear.
Most of us would agree that the average human has more self-control than the average dog. Most people also would agree that the average person probably would be justified in shoving, hitting or punching someone who runs up to them and won‚Äôt get out of their face.
Please leash your dog, for everyone‚Äôs safety.
Still more frustrating the Department of Parks and Recreation has set aside three dog parks throughout the city. Taxpayer money funds these parks. If dog owners don‚Äôt want to use them, let‚Äôs step up off-leash enforcement. Otherwise why bother with the dog parks?

One of the most power financial figures in the nation came to Binghamton on Tuesday to listen, and he got an earful.
New York Federal Reserve President William Dudley heard frustrations about a lack of qualified job applicants, an undefined state economic development process and a regulatory environment that seemingly strangles the region's ability to even maintain the status quo.
Taking part in a roundtable discussion with 18 community members from industries as diverse as plumbing and insurance, Dudley acknowledged economic challenges in the Southern Tier are significant, noting that Binghamton and other communities in the region have "had a tough slog."
While much of the nation, including the other upstate regions of Rochester and Buffalo, have made major strides in recovering from the 2008 economic collapse, the Southern Tier still wallows near the bottom of the heap in economic activity. Job losses in the region have stemmed but not grown. And the real estate market is known for its affordability because, unlike the recovery in the balance of the nation, home values, in large part, have failed to exhibit any price appreciation over several years.
"The good news is (the economy) can't fall much further." he told participants gathered at the second-flood offices of The Agency, formerly the Broome County Economic Development Agency.
Typical of the region's dilemma is the situation at Willow Run Foods, a Kirkwood-based food distributor with $500 million in annual sales. Terry Wood, Willow Run chairman, said his company is unable to grow because of an inability to hire people to staff its warehouse on top of a nationwide shortage of tractor-trailer drivers. Willow Run has turned down contracts and is thinking of shedding other business in-house because of its critical labor shortage.
While the region has a wide array of good-paying jobs, "we're not seeing people coming through the doors to apply," said Jennifer Conway, executive director of Greater Binghamton Chamber of Commerce.
Or take an exasperated Joe Mirabito, chief of Mirabito Energy, whose ability to bring a much-needed natural gas supply to the maker of fork lifts in Greene and the producer of yogurt in Chenango County to aid economic growth is stymied by New York's rejection of the Constitution Pipeline.
Even a nonprofit was irritated with its inability to push forward a $1.3 million, 30,000-square-foot building project because money from the much-heralded $500 million Upstate Revitalization Initiative is apparently caught up in the red tape.
"They are actually holding up the process," said Chet Schultz of First Niagara and member of the Salvation Army's board of directors.
Dudley makes annual treks across his district ‚Äî which includes New York, New Jersey, a portion of Connecticut, Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands ‚Äî to learn of economic conditions and inform his opinion on economic policy. As a member of the powerful Federal Open Market Committee, he has a major voice in setting interest rates and is said to be a close ally of Federal Reserve Board Chairwoman Janet Yellen.
Commenting on the national economy, Dudley said the British rejection of the European Union casts a cloud over the global economy, indicating the Fed's push to raise interest rates, at near historic lows, could be delayed as a result.
But Dudley was in the region to learn about the local economy, and try to focus business and community leaders "focused on the right issue."
More than anything, local economic conditions are marked by an atmosphere of uncertainty, said Maureen Wilson, a commercial real estate agent with Pyramid Brokerage.
"There is more activity and a lot more people looking, but there's a lot of paralysis," she said.
New York's Southern Tier has a rich industrial heritage as the birthplace of IBM, the community that fostered the development of the flight simulation industry and powerful manufacturing base in the Elmira region. But through the 1980s that industrial base withered as a result the evolution of technology and as industry fled to more business friendly environs in the United States and abroad.
Dudley noted the Binghamton region alone lost 70 percent of its manufacturing jobs over the past 30 years. Those jobs are not coming back, he said. To fill the gap, he said, communities may need to meld the region's rich educational base and the industries that remain.
Unlike Binghamton and Elmira, Ithaca, with its connection to Cornell University, has bucked the trend of its neighboring communities, growing jobs and incomes. A similar approach could be possibly repeated in the communities that are lagging.
Panel participants agreed that the region is afflicted with a "woe is me" attitude, a perception that may be holding back innovative approaches that present potential for an economic resurgence.
Discovering the communities' comparative advantages and leveraging those features could be one formula for success, Dudley suggested.Tuesday, December 18, 2012
Farewell to Fall and Giveaway
I planned to write this post a couple of weeks ago after I took these photos. I knew that the fall colors wouldn't last much longer, and I was right since we had a run of freezing weather. But shortly after taking the photos for this post one of my cats once again bit the power cord on my Mac, which meant that I ran out of juice. The nearest Apple store is 150+ miles away so I had to wait for a new one to be delivered. All that said, I'm glad to be back, especially since I promised to announce the winner of my book giveaway. But before that ...
I'd like to reintroduce this oddball plant. It's not easy to find but if you do find it, grab it. I have to cut it back in early spring by about a third. Otherwise, it gets floppy, most likely because it gets a tad too much morning shade. I think it would be more robust and less floppy in full sun. Mine stays about 4 feet tall and wide. It's evergreen and the leaves are leathery, and it has absolutely no pests.
It blooms in November and December down South, and partially because of the time of year when fewer plants are blooming, it becomes covered in pollinators - all kinds of bees, butterflies, and other critters. It has a kind of dense fragrance, not sweet.
Let's not forget the roses at this time of year. 'Belinda's Dream' gets really large blooms in the fall. I just love the fragrance of this one.
The little woodland garden has seen more glorious days but I always like the hydrangea this time of year. Plus the hellebores should be blooming in a little while.
Here's my newest tree, a Louisiana Super Plant last year (or was it this year?). Yes, it's just a stick with leaves right now, but give it time. I do like the colors it gets in fall.
Well, I did it. I pulled out the quince that kept biting me with its thorns near the irrigation panel, and decided to give my Meyer lemon a try outdoors in a stock tank. (I know this doesn't look great yet, but I'm still contemplating what else to do here.) I also pulled up some more lawn (yay!!) and replaced it with gravel.
The reason I think I may have a chance to raise a lemon tree outdoors in Zone 8a is that this area gets lovely winter sun. The bricks along the house hold that heat and to the right of the picture you may be able to see the fence and a planting bed. I figure between the two I may have a nice microclimate. I've got my fingers crossed anyway.
I bought some recycled metal art for my new-ish mini-deck. This was made by artisan Jhonson Augustin in Haiti and is a recycled steel drum. I got the idea from Leaf Magazine (Oh, you haven't heard of them? You must check them out!).
No, this vine no longer looks like this. It turned to mush last week from the freezes. But I wanted to show off the nice blue pot I bought in Austin. :-)
And now, the lucky winner of The Unexpected Houseplant by Tovah Martin, handpicked by my cat Chobe, is Randy of A Southern Eden! Randy, I'll be sending you an email to get your address and will let Timber Press know. Congratulations.

A lovely post Jean and Eupatorium viburnoides sounds like a great plant. gail!
Hope you have a very Merry Christmas, Jean! And please scratch Chobe on the head for me! Thanks again!
It's a treat to see all these vibrant fall colors, not to mention a butterfly on this cold day. Your woodland garden looks like such a peaceful place to just sit and meditate. Wishing you and yours a very Merry Christmas, Jean!!The SNP leader has revealed how she and husband Peter Murrell, the party‚Äôs chief executive, lost a baby when she was 40, shortly before the 2011 Scottish parliamentary election campaign, on 3 January, 2011 she attended events to mark the 40th anniversary of the Ibrox disaster, in which 66 Rangers football supporters were crushed to death.
Ms Sturgeon, who has never spoken about her loss before, has been previously hurt by assumptions that she put her political career before having a family.
Speaking after extracts of the book were published ina Sunday newspaper, Ms Sturgeon said: ‚ÄúThis was obviously a painful experience for Peter and I, and while Mandy has known about it for some time, she has always respected our decision not to talk about it publicly.
‚ÄúI gave her the go-ahead to make reference to it now in the hope that it might challenge some of the assumptions and judgments that are still made about women ‚Äì especially in politics ‚Äì who don‚Äôt have children.
‚ÄúThere are many reasons why women don‚Äôt have children. Some of us simply don‚Äôt want to, some of us worry about the impact on our career ‚Äì and there is still so much to do, through better childcare, more progressive working practices and more enlightened attitudes, to make sure we don‚Äôt feel we have to choose.
‚ÄúAnd sometimes, for whatever reason, having a baby just doesn‚Äôt happen ‚Äì no matter how much we might want it to.
‚ÄúFor me, as for many women, all of these things have been true at different times ‚Äì the point is that judgments and assumptions shouldn‚Äôt be made about what are personal choices and experiences.‚Äù, ‚ÄòYes‚Äô,.‚Äô‚Äô Ms Sturgeon later tweeted: ‚ÄúThanks for all your kind messages this morning. @PeterMurrell & I really appreciate it.‚Äù

With machine learning and AI being all of the craze now, it‚Äôs no surprise people from around the globe are finding implementations in sports. One of the more popular applications in sports, right now, is using machine learning to track players on the field without all of the need for expensive wearables and detectors by implementing deep learning into computer vision. In this space, Track160 is one of the more common names you come across, with proven success in fundraising rounds securing a $5 million investment during its Series A round, as detailed in a previous Patent Forecast¬Æ insight, but if it wants to keep the ball rolling as one of the leaders in the industry, it better start working on its patent portfolio as it is only assigned two (2) patent applications as of June 2021, leaving the company no enforceable exclusivity rights.
Founded in 2017, Track160 is still in its early stages of development. So, not having much activity in the Patent Forecast¬Æ doesn‚Äôt come as too much of a surprise but, in an area as hot as AI, exclusivity is huge when it comes to bringing products to market. While it is possible some patent applications might have been filed with non-publication requests, the company should make sure not to neglect protecting its technology, especially considering the previous success they have had with raising funding, So far, Track160 has proven that they have a good idea, but the many other companies are taking the same route to try and solve it. While Track160 might be ahead of these start-ups now, it might want to consider setting aside some of its funds next round to strengthen its portfolio and better its position in the sector to make sure it stays ahead. Also, it should consider increasing its activity simply so it can raise more funding. Whenever it comes to high-tech solutions, it‚Äôs common for investors to dig a little deeper into their products if they know you have patents and enforceable exclusivity backing you.

In this FREE 6 weeks support group we will work through the 5 principles of EDIT. This group is not just for people with eating disorders. Anyone that feels they need to improve their relationship with food is welcome.
I am a certified level ll Eating Disorder Recovery Coach and look forward to hosting this group.
5 Principles of EDIT:
Love Your Self ‚Äì today, no matter what you weigh! From this place of Self-Love, you‚Äôll naturally take better care of yourself ‚Äì and a healthy weight can be a natural outcome. You‚Äôll discover that you are much more than your body, finding compassion for your ‚Äúflaws,‚Äù and inspiration from your ‚Äúhidden‚Äù assets. Let your true values lead you to your True Self!
Be True To Your Self ‚Äì trust intuition, your answers are within! Your intuition is that ‚Äúgut feeling‚Äù or a ‚Äúsixth sense,‚Äù which goes beyond your logical mind. You‚Äôve probably listened to your intuition to guide relationship decisions, or career choices ‚Äì but what about eating, exercise, and the achievement of a healthy weight? Discover how to use Intuitive Eating and Intuitive Exercise as your guides!
Give To Your Self ‚Äì nurture by feeding your true hunger! Think about all of the different ways you give to others ‚Äì your friends who need assistance, your work with endless to-do lists, your family who depends on you. Are these activities fulÔ¨Ålling? Or, do you seek FULL-FILLment by consuming excess food? Discover your true needs, and how to meet them with regular practices of Self-Care!
Express Your Self ‚Äì balance mood instead of coping with food! Feeling stressed or depressed? Eating can be a way to deal with intense emotions. However, ‚Äúfeeding‚Äù your feelings can actually make things worse ‚Äì with additional feelings of frustration, guilt, or shame. Break the food-mood cycle by discovering new and more effective ways to regulate your emotions!
Believe In Your Self ‚Äì act as if you are free and so it shall be! Imagine a day in the life of the person you will be when you are practicing the Ô¨Årst four principles in your daily life. Notice how you feel from the ‚Äúinside-out‚Äù‚Äì spiritually, emotionally, mentally, physically. In this fifth principle, you‚Äôll bring your visions of success into reality, one day at a time. Ongoing success is easy!

Whether you need emergency assistance getting into your vehicle, a new key fob or even help with your ignition, our team at Pop-A-Lock has the tools and experience necessary to get you going. Our experienced team offers all sorts of automotive locksmith services in order to best meet the needs of our customers. Some of these services include:
If you are in need of an automotive locksmith in the Charlotte area, we want you to call us, Pop-A-Lock of Charlotte, for the best experience around!
At Pop-A-Lock serving the Charlotte, North Carolina area, we believe that an automotive locksmith should be more helpful than just providing lockout, key duplication, and ignition repair services. We feel that we should also be the company you can turn to with whatever question you might have related to your automotive locksmith needs. Here are few of the common questions we get asked:
Under what circumstances would you need proof that I am an authorized driver?
We want to be as helpful as possible, but we certainly do not want to assist someone with stealing a vehicle or getting keys to one they aren‚Äôt authorized to drive. You wouldn‚Äôt want us to arbitrarily create a new key for your car for someone you don‚Äôt want driving it. We are always careful to ensure we only create keys or grant access for those who have legitimate rights. One situation where we wouldn‚Äôt require documentation is to open a vehicle with a child or pet locked inside.
Can you get my car unlocked without causing any damage to the door, windows, or lock?
Yes, we have the proper equipment and techniques to gain access to a locked vehicle with no lasting effects from our efforts.
How many spare keys do most people have?
We can make you as many duplicate keys for your vehicle as you wish. It is always wise to have at least one spare, but there are reasons to have others. For example, if you have multiple drivers in your family sharing the vehicle, each having their own key is beneficial. Some people chose to have a spare on a separate keyring for giving to valets and mechanics, so they aren‚Äôt being given the same keyring that the house key and other important keys are on.Avalanche danger "high‚Äô
SUMMIT COUNTY ‚Äì Colorado Avalanche Information Center (CAIC) forecasters issued an avalanche warning for the Tenmile and Gore ranges after a storm brought more than 2 feet of snow to the High Country.
According to CAIC director Knox Williams, the avalanche danger in the backcountry around Summit County and Vail is ‚Äúhigh,‚Äù meaning natural and triggered avalanches are ‚Äúlikely‚Äù to ‚Äúcertain.‚Äù
‚ÄúI think we‚Äôre setting ourselves up for a widespread avalanche cycle,‚Äù Williams said. ‚ÄúThe one big kicker is that they‚Äôre calling for a substantial increase in winds this afternoon and overnight. If that happens, we‚Äôre going to build slab in a heartbeat.‚Äù
White-out conditions prevented avalanche forecasters from accessing the backcountry Tuesday to evaluate snow conditions.
As of Tuesday morning, avalanche forecasters knew of one slide, in the sixth of the Seven Sisters on Loveland Pass. The slide closed the pass, Williams said. Closing the pass also keeps would-be backcountry skiers away from some of the dangerous chutes and steep slopes along the pass.
‚ÄúI‚Äôm kind of glad Loveland Pass is closed,‚Äù Williams said Tuesday morning. ‚ÄúIt postpones the inevitability of people getting caught in slides today. But tomorrow could be really touchy. When snow gets this deep, you almost have to go steep.‚Äù
However, more snow is forecast, and that could change conditions again.
Snow plow operators along Berthoud Pass are triggering numerous slides by tossing snow from the road onto the unsteady snowpack below, Williams said. Most of those are shallow releases, meaning only about the top foot of the 2 feet that has fallen so far is sliding.
Williams welcomes the snow, however.
‚ÄúWe‚Äôre going to look back and really like this storm,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs so much water in it. This is what we need to replenish our reservoirs.‚Äù
According to Williams, the snow that‚Äôs blanketed Summit County has from 1.5 to 2 inches of water in every 2 feet of snow. For example, he said, Arapahoe Basin had received 19 inches of new snow by 6 a.m. Tuesday, and in that was 1.25 inches of water. Williams said that‚Äôs normal.
Today‚Äôs forecast is for partly cloudy skies and high winds.
‚ÄúI think things will quiet down on the west end of Summit County and Vail,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs where the lower snow amounts are going to be. We might get a breather.‚Äù
Other forecasters say they expect another snowstorm to blow through the area Thursday.Knowledgeable Maryville Motorcycle Accident Attorneys
Helping injured motorcyclists in Blount County and throughout East Tennessee
Good weather and high gas prices make motorcycles an attractive and affordable transportation alternative for many people. Motorcycle enthusiasts enjoy the freedom and the fresh air as they travel from place to place. Motorcyclists, however, do not benefit from the protection afforded by closed passenger vehicles. When accidents happen, bikers often suffer severe injuries or fatalities.
The Tennessee Department of Safety reports 152 motorcyclist fatalities in 2019. Since popular misconceptions about bikers create challenges when injury victims try to obtain the compensation they deserve, they should to seek legal support from highly experienced motorcycle accident attorneys. The Maryville motorcycle accident lawyers at Shepherd & Long, P.C. are dedicated to helping victims pursue their rights in these often-catastrophic injury cases.
Common causes of Tennessee motorcycle accidents
As with any type of motor vehicle accident, either driver or both drivers can be liable for a motorcycle accident, but often public opinion tends to assume motorcyclists are at fault for most accidents. However, in our experience, often another motorist or party is liable. Some of these reasons include:
- Visibility. Motorists may not even see a motorcycle on the road. Many drivers are looking for other larger vehicles, while failing to observe motorcycles even if they are in plain view.
- Presumption of right-of-way. Some drivers fail to yield right-of-way to motorcyclists, which is both dangerous and against traffic laws.
- Short following distances. Motorcycles can stop more quickly than larger vehicles. Yet many cars and trucks do not account for this when choosing the gap they leave between their vehicles and the motorcycles in front of them. This can cause tragic rear-end accidents.
- Roadway obstructions. Potholes or bumps on the road can appear in an instant. While a car can survive an encounter with a roadway obstruction, motorcyclists can lose control, resulting in a single-vehicle accident or throwing riders into traffic and involving other vehicles.
How can a motorcycle accident attorney help?
As experienced Maryville personal injury lawyers, one of our most important tasks is refuting the misconceptions that can cause insurance companies, opposing attorneys and juries to deny the validity of motorcycle accident claims. We prepare every case by retaining experienced motorcycle accident investigators to examine the accident scene, the damaged vehicles, and any and all information and photos you provide. Investigator reports, combined with information offered by medical experts, can provide convincing proof of liability and fully document the past, current and future anticipated costs for your claim.
At Shepherd & Long, P.C., we employ every resource we can to prove your case and secure the highest amount of compensation possible.
What to do if you are injured in a motorcycle accident
Many motorcycle accident victims suffer injuries that prevent them from remaining at the accident scene. Remember, however, if you do remain on the scene, everything you do or say can make a difference to the safety of all involved parties ‚Äî and it can affect your ability to pursue compensation from any of the parties responsible for your injuries. The following tips can help you protect your safety and your legal rights after a motorcycle accident.
Take care of your injuries first
Although the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) estimates that the use of helmets saved over 1,850 lives in 2016, even helmets cannot help motorcyclists entirely avoid severe, potentially disabling injuries. You can preserve your rights by remaining at the scene of an accident. However, if you need immediate medical attention, your health is more important. Be sure to check for injuries to others, and call 911 for help.
If you can remain at the accident scene
If you know you can wait a short time to see a doctor, staying at the accident scene provides the opportunity to gather evidence and information you can use for an insurance claim or legal case. Keep in mind that your case is likely to receive challenges due to bias against motorcyclists. Taking photos and capturing many different angles of the roadway and the damaged vehicles can reveal details an investigator may not see from a single photo. Err on the side of gathering too much information and evidence.
Maintain detailed records
Medical treatment, medicine, crutches and other items you purchase represent just one type of expense related to your injuries. You may lose time from work, and you may need to pay for household and other services that you cannot perform until you heal. Consider every detail to avoid paying unfair out-of-pocket expenses.
The settlement offer often does not represent the best offer
Insurance companies count on your desire to put the accident behind you. They often tempt you with a quick offer that may not represent the full costs associated with your injuries. Your signature makes the offer final, so you need to carefully consider your true expenses now and in the future. I often review offers and then negotiate more appropriate settlements for my clients.
Remember, it costs nothing to schedule a free consultation. The Maryville motorcycle accident lawyers at Shepherd & Long can evaluate your legal options before you take any action on your own.
My loved one was killed in a Maryville motorcycle accident ‚Äì can you help?
No amount of money can compensate a family that loses a loved one in an accident caused by a careless driver. And after a tragic loss, families may face a potential mountain of medical bills at a time when they also experience a sudden loss of funds due to lost income.
When a person dies from injuries caused by negligent or wrongful acts of others, certain survivors have the right to pursue a wrongful death claim against any party who has liability for the death. This means our motorcycle accident lawyers pursue medical and other expenses incurred before your loved one‚Äôs death. The law also considers losses sustained by immediate family members, such as the following:
- Funeral expenses
- Loss of future financial support, benefits and inheritance
- Loss of companionship
- Mental and emotional anguish
Families seeking compensation from the responsible parties in fatal motorcycle accidents face the same issues as injury victims. They must provide convincing evidence that establishes liability even when public perception tends to assume fault on the part of motorcyclists. Families seldom have access to direct evidence from the scene of the accident, adding challenges to these claims. We enlist the assistance of investigative professionals when needed to develop an effective case for my clients.
Frequently asked questions about East Tennessee motorcycle accidents
A motorcycle ride on a beautiful day can add enjoyment to your daily commute ‚Äì and saves gas money. However, motorcycles provide little protection in a traffic collision, and motorcyclists need to understand the potential consequences of serious accidents. We are pleased to provide answers to some of the questions we hear from our clients.
- Are there any special issues involved in filing a motorcycle accident insurance claim?
- I went to the hospital immediately after my accident. How do I collect the evidence I need for my claim?
- Do I have legal options for recovering damages after a single-vehicle crash?
- Can I file a claim if I cannot find the driver who caused my accident?
- Do I need to take my case to court?
- Do I need a lawyer to file a claim?
Are there any special issues involved in filing a motorcycle accident insurance claim?
Whether you file a claim against the policy of a liable party or against your own policy, perhaps the main concern involves coverage limits. Motorcycle accidents often cause severe injuries that require extensive expenses for medical treatments. There are also related costs you might incur, possibly for the rest of your life, in the case of disability. This is why we thoroughly assess your situation in your free initial consultation to determine if you should pursue other legal avenues.
I went to the hospital immediately after my accident. How do I get the evidence I need for my claim?
The police can supply the police report you need to file a claim, and they can most likely provide basic information about the involved drivers. As an experienced motorcycle accident attorney, I understand that medical attention comes first, and I have the means to develop an effective case even under challenging circumstances.
Do I have legal options for recovering damages after a single-vehicle crash?
You can always file a claim against your own insurance policy, but you may have other legal options depending on the details of your specific situation. For example, if you lost control of your bike after hitting a pothole or other hazard caused by poor road maintenance, you may have a claim against the local municipality that failed to perform necessary road repairs.
Can I file a claim if I cannot find the driver who caused my accident?
Your own insurance policy can still provide coverage, possibly as a hit-and-run claim or as part of uninsured motorist coverage. If your insurance company attempts to deny coverage, our attorneys are ready to intervene on your behalf.
Do I need to take my case to court?
Particularly if your injuries result in permanent disability, we may recommend a jury trial as the best way to pursue the full compensation you need to cover a lifetime of expenses. However, we can also negotiate a fair settlement out of court even if the insurance policy of the liable party does not provide the coverage you need. We provide you all the information you need to make an informed decision.
Do I need a lawyer to file a claim?
It always makes sense to discuss your claim with an attorney before taking any action on your own, and legal advice is particularly important when dealing with complex motorcycle accidents. We offer a free consultation to assess your case, so it costs nothing to learn your options.

PICK-5 WINNING SYSTEM
WORKS IN ALL STATES PICK-5 GAMES
INCLUDING POWERBALL - MEGA MILLIONS
CASH 4 LIFE & LUCKY 4 LIFE
This is the winning PICK-5 system that everyone is raving about. Players all around the country have cashed in thousands of winning tickets using this proven method. If you are ready to finally win real money in your State's PICK-5, POWERBALL, MEGA-MILLIONS, CASH 4 LIFE and LUCKY 4 LIFE games, then the MILLENNIUM WHEEL is your ace in the hole!
From time to time a new product or technology comes along that is so much better than what it replaces, that we have trouble remembering how we ever lived without it. Take indoor plumbing for example. The minute it came out, no one wanted to walk to the outhouse in the middle of the night in the freezing cold anymore! Or how about the telephone. Suddenly you could talk to your sister in the next State anytime you wanted instead of traveling for hours or writing letters. Well my friends, let me tell you, I have just invented something that will forever change the way we all play and win our States Pick-5 Lottery games.
A few years ago we sent out a trial version of my new MILLENNIUM WHEEL system to a select group of system testers around the country to take it for a test drive. As usual, we asked them to try it in their States game and let us know what they thought of it and how well it performed for them. The response was overwhelmingly positive. Everyone thought that this was the best Pick-5 system I have ever developed and that they would never use any other type of wheel again. Many players reported that it was the easiest system they had ever used and agreed that the results were not only amazing but virtually instantaneous. One tester even told us that it was almost like "legalized cheating." Of course I already knew that because I am the one that created this system!
Before I tell you how the incredible MILLENNIUM WHEEL system works, I want to make a few things crystal clear. This system does not require the use of colored pens, it does not require the use of formulas or workouts and it does not require a registration form. It's quick and it's easy! After hearing that I'd bet that you like it already! What the MILLENNIUM WHEEL system does do is offer you ready-to-play Pick-5 number combinations that will give you a level of coverage you have only dreamed of before. Do you want to play 10, 15 or 20 numbers? No problem. How about 25 numbers? Again, no problem. How about playing all the numbers in your game? Why not!!! You can play 30, 35 even 39 numbers. That's right, you can actually play all 39 numbers in the 5/39 game! By now you are probably thinking that I have either gone completely bonkers or else I may actually be onto something. Let me assure you, I am just as sane as I have always been, and yes, I certainly am onto something.
THE EASIEST WAY
TO PLAY & WIN
Here's how it works. The MILLENNIUM WHEEL system breaks the game down into three sections. The first section contains the two LOWEST numbers in any drawing. The second section contains the MIDDLE number and the third section contains the two HIGHEST numbers in any drawing. For example, if the numbers 7-14-23-33 and 38 were drawn, the 7 and 14 would be our LOWEST numbers, the 23 would be our MIDDLE number and the 33 and 38 would be our HIGHEST numbers. Now that was easy, wasn't it!!! Okay then, here comes the magic: the MILLENNIUM WHEEL let's you play as many LOWEST, MIDDLE and HIGHEST numbers as you want. You can play anywhere from 4, 6, 8, 10, 12 or even more numbers in each section. Picture it this way - Imagine you are playing a 5/39 game, now visualize all 39 numbers lined up from lowest to highest. Now imagine that you have three blankets, and you can throw those blankets over any amount of numbers in each section. For example, lets say we want to play 10 numbers in each section in our example 5/39 game.Shown below is an illustration of how this is done:
We can now win the JACKPOT using our MILLENNIUM WHEEL if the two lowest numbers drawn are in our LOWEST section, the middle number drawn is in our MIDDLE section and the two highest numbers drawn are in our HIGHEST section. That's all there is to it!!! Not only can we win the 5 out of 5 number JACKPOT, but we can also win many second (4 out of 5 numbers right) and third (3 out of 5 numbers right) prizes. The unique coverage here is amazing and it all lies in the power of the MILLENNIUM WHEEL.
As I said before, you can play a few or as many numbers in each section that you want. The system comes with a total of 25 different wheels, and you can play for as little as $8.00 per drawing. We have even included three "WHOPPER" wheels that allow you to play all of the numbers in your game, up to 39 total numbers. Can you imagine that...totally unique coverage that allows you to play every number in any game up to 39 numbers!!! If your game has more than 39 numbers, or if you play Powerball or Mega Millions, the coverage is still amazing with up to 39 total numbers covered for each drawing. This has never before been possible, but there has also never been a MILLENNIUM WHEEL system before!
On October 30th 2008, Winona Davis of Syracuse NY won the $88,777.00 JACKPOT playing the NY 5/39 game. The winning numbers were 11-13-25-30-32. Shown below is a sample selection box for the MILLENNIUM WHEEL that covers 4 numbers in each section. This wheel gives you exactly 16 Pick-5 combinations to wager when playing these 12 numbers.
Playing this exact wheel in the 10/30 NY 5/39 drawing not only produces a JACKPOT ticket, but also three second place tickets worth $465.50 each, plus two third prize tickets worth $23.50 each and six FREE PLAYS. That translates to a total return of $90,226.50 on a $16.00 investment. That means that 12 of the 16 tickets were winners!!! How do you like them apples?
On December 16th, 2008, Jose DeDaperez of LAKEWORTH FL, R. VAL of MIAMI FL and ROBERT PIERCE of STEWART FL each won there own $73,924.04 JACKPOT playing the Florida FANTASY 5/36 game. The winning numbers were 12-14-16-21-23. Shown below is a sample selection box for the MILLENNIUM WHEEL that covers 4 numbers in each section. Again, this wheel gives you exactly 16 Pick-5 combinations to wager when playing these 12 numbers.
Playing this exact wheel in the 12/16 FL 5/36 drawing not only produces a JACKPOT ticket, but also three second place tickets, two third prize tickets and six FREE PLAYS. Are you starting to like what you are seeing? I hope so, because these are real dollars we are talking about here. Real dollars that could be yours!!!
On the very same day, December 16th 2008, the winning numbers in the Georgia 5/39 game were 10-13-27-34-37. Shown below is a sample selection box for the MILLENNIUM WHEEL that covers 6 numbers in each section.
Not only does this wheel give you the 5 out of 5 winning JACKPOT combination which was worth $152,208.00, but it gives you 5 second prize winning combinations worth $193.00 each plus 3 third prize combinations worth $9.00 each plus 15 FREE PLAYS for a total return of $153,200.00. I'll bet that no one out there would have any trouble spending that kind of cabbage!!! I could show you many more winning examples from all around the country, but I think you get the idea. Now it's time for you to win your game - ARE YOU READY TO GET SERIOUS ABOUT WINNING?

A Holiday Inn in Reading was used for discharging surgery patients at the height of the first wave
.
Discussions between trust leaders, consultancy groups and hotel chains in the capital have reportedly taken place this week.
A source close to discussions told The Telegraph: "One thing being explored is the idea of moving non-elective surgery patients into hotels after their operations, to try and keep surgeries going but also remove them from wards where there is potentially a greater risk of catching Covid."
Hotel chain Holiday Inn are understood to be on standby to house discharged patients to free up bed space and prevent non-Covid patients contracting the disease from hospital staff or Covid-19 patients.
University of Oxford released new data this week showing hospital-contracted infections for Covid-19 accounted for almost one in five of all hospital cases in England.
‚ÄúThis shows there is a significant problem with healthcare-acquired infections,‚Äù said Professor Carl Heneghan, who led the analysis.
NHS England said there were currently no national plans to discharge patients into hotels.
In 2014, it was revealed the Royal Free Hospital in London had used budget hotel Premier Inn to house patients and free up hospital beds at a cost of ¬£500,000 over two years.Posts133

Whats the most painful thing you've ever experienced
SorceressPol replied to blike's topic in The LoungeI have a messed up stomach and I go in for tests on a regular basis. Most are okay except for the Abdominal CT. When they put the saline injection in my arm, at first everything is okay until it reaches my stomach. Then the pain starts and increases exponentially. By the end of it I'm usually crying and unable to talk for a while.
Satellite Security
SorceressPol posted a topic in The LoungeI didn't know what section to throw this in, but are any of you guys worried about the security of our satellites? I guess I noticed just how much of our everyday life has to do with satellites. Cell phones, television, etc.. The way I've seen computer viruses becoming much more sophisticated lately, and it doesn't seem like the government is on the ball when it comes to keeping updated. Maybe I'm just being paranoid.

SorceressPol replied to GrandMasterK's topic in Anatomy, Physiology and NeuroscienceTry what YT said. I too have stomach problems and drinking water hurts something fierce. Try the water at a warmer temp and sip it slowly.
lack of sleep and brain damage
SorceressPol replied to abskebabs's topic in Anatomy, Physiology and NeuroscienceLack of sleep will cause brain damage if the body doesn't receive sleep after an extended period of time. You already know that the body heals itself mostly when it's sleeping. If the body can't heal itself day after day, the damages just keeps adding up. You won't die first. Your memory and cognitive functions go out the window.

SorceressPol replied to Pangloss's topic in PoliticsThat's not punishment. They already pay that much and more to coyotes to bring them over here. I bet people waiting in line to come here legally would be willing to do that in order to jump to the front. Not to mention they're still here in the country, so what's the incentive of them bothering to learn english? There is no way this system would work right now. Such a program would require a local/state/federal collaboration. How else would they be able to try and figure how long a huge group of undocumented people have been here?

Expert reading in nursing school details the profession‚Äôs four essential characteristics.
Master of Science in Nursing (MSN) degree programs provide students with opportunities to immerse themselves in career specializations while broadening their knowledge in foundational courses that explore topics like leadership and research.
Issues and Trends in Nursing is one of those core courses for students in Walden University‚Äôs online MSN program. As a student in this course, you‚Äôll receive an overview of the evolution of nursing as a profession and learn how the definition of nursing has evolved, too.
In a key reading assignment in the course, Catherine E. Neuman, MSN, RN, NEA-BC, explores nursing‚Äôs identity and its four essential characteristics in ‚ÄúNursing‚Äôs Social Policy Statement,‚Äù from The Essential Guide to Nursing Practice: Applying ANA‚Äôs Scope and Standards in Practice and Education.
In the following excerpt, read along with Walden‚Äôs online nursing school students to learn how Florence Nightingale, the founder of modern nursing, defined the profession, and how it has changed through the years:1
Definition of Nursing
Florence Nightingale (1859, p. 9) defined nursing as having charge of the personal health of somebody: ‚ÄúAnd what nursing has to do ‚Ä¶ is to put the patient in the best condition for nature to act upon him.‚Äù
Later, Virginia Henderson (1960, p. 42) defined the purpose of nursing: .‚Äù
Nursing was defined in the original Nursing: A Social Policy Statement (ANA, 1980, p. 9) as ‚Äúthe diagnosis and treatment of human responses to actual or potential health problems.‚Äù The current definition in the 2010 Nursing‚Äôs Social Policy Statement: The Essence of the Profession remains unchanged from that in the 2004 edition: ‚ÄúNursing is the protection, promotion, and optimization of health and abilities; prevention of illness and injury; alleviation of suffering through the diagnosis and treatment of human response; and advocacy in the care of individuals, families, communities, and populations (ANA, 2010b, p. 10).‚Äù
This definition encompasses four essential characteristics of nursing: human responses or phenomena; theory application; nursing actions or interventions; and outcomes:
- Human responses are the responses of individuals to actual or potential health problems of concern to nurses, including any observable need, concern, condition, event, or fact of interest that may be the target of evidence-based nursing practice.
- Theory application is built on understanding theories of nursing and other disciplines as a basis for evidence-based nursing actions.
- Nursing actions are theoretically derived and evidence-based and require well-developed intellectual competencies. Their goal is to protect, promote, and optimize health; to prevent illness and injury; to alleviate suffering; and to advocate for all populations.
- Outcomes of nursing actions produce beneficial results in relation to identified human responses. Evaluation of those actions determines whether they have been effective. Findings from nursing research provide rigorous scientific evidence of beneficial outcomes of specific nursing actions.
Take Your Nursing Career to the Next Level
Walden‚Äôs RN to MSN online degree program offers stimulating coursework with diverse perspectives on nursing, such as those found in Neuman‚Äôs concise and informative article. Through weekly discussions and assignments, you‚Äôll explore and share personal experiences in contemporary nursing. The course will challenge you to examine and propose solutions to nursing issues, including those you encounter in your workplace.
Walden‚Äôs rich MSN degree experience can further your current nursing career or point you in a new direction. For working professionals, online nursing schools like Walden‚Äôs are an exceptional choice. You can continue working while studying and training to further your career. And with a master‚Äôs in nursing, you can define and shape your future.

To mark the occasion, Edo shared a sweet post on his personal Instagram calling Beatrice "most beautiful person in the world."

You are the kindest, loveliest and most beautiful person in the world. Thank you my darling for every second."
Beatrice and Edo's wedding was slightly unconventional by royal standards‚Äîrather than a large-scale spectacle like her cousins Prince William and Prince Harry as well as her sister Princess Eugenie had, the global COVID-19 pandemic forced the couple to delay, and ultimately scale back their celebration for a private ceremony in Windsor on July 17, 2021. The wed in the Royal Chapel of All Saints at Royal Lodge, Beatrice's childhood home, in a small, socially-distanced ceremony attended by Beatrice's grandparents, Queen Elizabeth and Prince Philip. For the big day, Princess Beatrice wore a vintage dress, that was loaned to her by the Queen for her own collection; a glittering white gown by Norman Hartnell, who also designed the Queen's wedding dress and coronation gown.
Earlier this year, Beatrice and Edo announced that they are expecting their first child together this autumn. Edo also has a son, Christopher Woolf, known as "Wolfie," from a previous relationship.

Downtown Palo Alto Farmers' Market to reopen, masks requiredUploaded: May 15, 2020
After a two-month hiatus, the Downtown Palo Alto Farmers' Market is returning on May 30 with new safety guidelines.
All vendors, customers and volunteers at the Saturday market will be required to wear masks (in accordance with a new city law). Booths will be spaced farther apart to allow for social distancing and a path will be marked through the market to guide customers. There will be no music or entertainment, no food samples and prepared foods can't be eaten on site. If the market gets too crowded, staff will ask customers to wait outside of the market on sidewalks until enough people leave to allow for social distancing.
"While the new normal will be very different, we're very excited to re-open and continue our 2020 season," said Bob McDiarmid, president of the volunteer-run farmers market.
The Downtown Palo Alto Farmers' Market will reopen on Saturday, May 30. Photo by Veronica Weber.
The downtown Palo Alto market closed in March as farmers markets throughout the Bay Area, considered essential food sources that are permitted to remain open, scrambled to adjust to new public health mandates. At many farmers markets now, vendors take customers' orders and give them their produce to avoid people touching food, and hand sanitizer and social distancing markers are the norm.
Of the 14 volunteers who help manage the downtown Palo Alto market, half are considered high risk for the coronavirus, McDiarmid said. It was untenable to run the market with so few people, so they "spent time talking to friends and family to beef up our volunteer ranks."
Once the May 7 shelter-in-place order was extended, they started planning for a reopening.
The Portola Valley Farmers' Market also temporarily closed in March but soon reopened as a drive-through market with online ordering.
The Los Altos Farmers' Market, which runs on Thursdays from May through September, also recently opened for the season and is requiring masks, along with other safety measures.
The Downtown Palo Alto Farmers' Market, which last year became a year-round market, will continue to operate Saturdays, 9 a.m. to 1 p.m., on Gilman Street between Forest and Hamilton avenues through December, unless the county mandates otherwise.
VERA, DARIA ARREDONDO (1946‚Äì2020). Daria Arredondo Vera, farm workers‚Äô rights activist in Texas, was born to Miguel Arredondo and Daria (Garcia) Arredondo in Rio Grande City, Texas, on November 18, 1946. One of ten children, Vera was only eight years old when she began to harvest onions, bell peppers, lettuce, watermelon, and cantaloupe in the Rio Grande Valley. Day-long field labor allowed little time for a formal education. Consequently, she attended school only through the third grade. With her formal education ended, she joined her large family to eke out an existence that provided the lowest of wages and no safety measures against exploitation. The 1960 U. S. census reported that nearly one-third of Starr County families earned less than $1,000 annually, with 70 percent earning less than $3,000 per year. Agricultural work was considered, along with mining and construction, one of the most dangerous occupations. Even so, eight-year-old Daria was permitted to do farm labor.
Daria Arredondo Vera (Image available on the Internet and included in accordance with Title 17 U.S.C. Section 107.)
She continued to work in the fields of the Rio Grande Valley after her marriage, when she was still in her teens, to Mario Vera. Their family eventually included three sons and six daughters. At the age of nineteen, Vera joined the nascent farm workers union in the Rio Grande Valley and became its secretary-treasurer. At the time, Vera and her fellow agricultural workers earned between forty and eighty-five cents an hour. Buoyed by the national farm workers‚Äô movement led by C√©sar Ch√°vez and Dolores Huerta, she became involved in the workers‚Äô struggle to raise their minimum pay to $1.25 an hour and the right to collective bargaining. In addition, they sought the addition of toilets and potable water in the fields.
In summer 1966 farm workers marched from the Rio Grande Valley to protest poor working conditions. Their two-month-long journey, known as La Marcha, culminated with a rally of 15,000 people in Austin.
La Marcha (Image available on the Internet and included in accordance with Title 17 U.S.C. Section 107.)
At the time, most Rio Grande Valley farm workers were employed by La Casita Farms, an enterprise said to take in more than $1,000,000 annually for its melon harvest; Sun-Tex Farms; Elmore & Stahl; and others. Soon she became involved in the Starr County Strike, which was also known as the Melon Strike. Vera joined with her fellow laborers to press their case for better working conditions. On June 1, 1966, more than 400 local farm workers voted to go on strike. The growers immediately brought in strike breakers from Mexico and attempted to lure workers with increases in hourly wages ranging from seventy cents to one dollar an hour. In response to this action, more than 80 percent of the local farm workers quit, which forced the closure of every packing shed on the first day of the strike. The ‚ÄúNew Party,‚Äù a Starr County political party, and local officials sought to break the strike that was later likened as ‚Äúheading into war.‚Äù
On October 24, 1966, Daria Vera, Irene Chandler, and others lay down in protest on the international border crossing bridge at Roma, Texas. They joined other strikers in the effort to prevent the entry of Mexican strike breakers.
The ensuing farmworker protests in which Vera participated led to La Marcha, a two-month-long journey that commenced on July 4, 1966. Protestors walked from Rio Grande City to Austin through the brutally hot and humid Texas summer. They were met at various cities by local and religious leaders who supported their cause. On Labor Day, September 5, 1966, La Marcha ended with a rally of 15,000 participants in Austin. Years later, in an interview with the Texas Standard, Vera asserted, ‚ÄúWorkers should be proud of what we did.‚Äù
Growers continued their push to bring Mexican workers across the border to replace the strikers. On October 24, 1966, Vera joined other strikers to block vehicles transporting strike breakers across the U.S.-Mexico border at Roma. During the confrontation, she and fellow striker Irene Chandler lay down on the bridge. Vera recalled telling Chandler, ‚Äú‚ÄòLet‚Äôs block the bridge, you and I. It doesn‚Äôt end here.‚Äô So we layed down and blocked the bridge.‚Äù For taking this action, Vera was arrested by the Texas Rangers. In 1967 she and Chandler were again arrested by the Texas Rangers and charged with ‚Äúunlawful assembly,‚Äù while carrying out strike activities.

Rebecca Flores, the longtime state director of the United Farm Workers Union in Texas, met Vera in 2015 when they planned the fiftieth anniversary of the Melon Strike. She recalled Vera as a labor activist whose ‚Äúspirit was always very strong,‚Äù who was confident that ‚Äújoining the strike and the union was the best thing she ever did.‚Äù Flores also noted that farm workers were rarely respected for harvesting many of the basic foods upon which Americans relied, but strike activities in 1966 ‚Äúcaught people‚Äôs attention. It was an awakening. Farm workers everywhere began to realize they could organize, too.‚Äù
The strike in which Vera was involved did not bring the rights that farm workers sought. Although in the following decades, port-a-potties and potable water were installed in the fields, agricultural workers still struggled to earn the federal minimum wage. For years following the 1966 strike, Vera continued to work in the fields and earned a meager living. The pastor and members of a church in Kenedy, a South Texas town through which Vera marched in the summer of 1966 on her way to Austin, built a home for her and replaced her dilapidated abode.
Vera‚Äôs commitment to challenge poor agricultural working conditions and her fight for fair pay was recognized late in her life. Historian Maritza de la Trinidad, who conducted an oral history with her, recalled, ‚ÄúDaria saw herself as the mother of the community, and through her activism she also became one of the people who would launch the civil rights movement in South Texas.‚Äù Fittingly, in a 2019 interview with the Texas Standard, Vera asserted that women are leaders in transforming society for the better.
Daria Arredondo Vera died at the age of seventy-three in San Antonio on August 6, 2020, after contracting COVID-19, the highly infectious virus that struck the Rio Grande Valley populace especially hard in the days leading to her death. She was buried in Los Vela‚Äôs Ranch Cemetery in Rio Grande City.

1943-2013
James Herbert, the UK horror writer who shot to fame in the 1970s with The Rats and The Fog , died yesterday at the age of 69.
In a career spanning 23 books he sold over 50 million copies worldwide. Despite those wonderfully lurid titles of his breakthrough novels ‚Äì and sniffy reviews from some literary snobs (Martin Amis was not a fan) ‚Äì he quickly transcended a reputation for gory sensationalism (which was never really deserved ‚Äì The Rats and The Fog are far more than just that). He was proud that his fourth novel, Fluke, sound its way onto the GCSE syllabus at one point, and books like The Magic Cottage , Nobody True, The Secret Of Crickley Hall a nd his final book, published last year Ash , saw him experimenting with various different approached to the horror genre.
Herbert, who lived in Sussex is survived by his wife, Eileen, and their three daughters. He was awarded an OBE in 2010, which he spoke about in his final SFX interview:
‚ÄúWhen I went up to get the OBE, it was Charles who actually pinned the medal onto me. The Queen was upstairs, washing her hair I think. He‚Äôs very nice. Funnily enough, I‚Äôve always liked Prince Charles. I think he‚Äôs a man with soul. Despite the bad press he gets I think he‚Äôs a good man and he‚Äôll make a good king someday. He said to me, ‚ÄòAre you working on a new book at the moment?‚Äô And I said, ‚ÄòYeah,‚Äô and I forgot all protocol and pointed at him and said, ‚ÄòAnd you‚Äôre in it.‚Äô If you‚Äôve ever seen a man blanche, that was Prince Charles. I said to him, ‚ÄòBut it‚Äôs okay, you come out fine, but there are certain things in there that may make you feel uncomfortable.‚Äô
‚ÄúIn fact, when I got my OBE, I forgot every protocol because you‚Äôre sort of drilled ‚Äì in a very nice way ‚Äì in the way you‚Äôre supposed to act. You don‚Äôt talk to the prince first, he speaks to you, and he‚Äôll ask you a question like, ‚ÄòHave you come a long way?‚Äô And you‚Äôre supposed to answer the question with, ‚ÄòYour Royal Highness‚Äô. After that, every other question you say ‚Äòsir‚Äô. I didn‚Äôt do any of that, none at all. And it wasn‚Äôt out of reverse snobbery, it‚Äôs just not the way I am. I only call headwaiters sir.‚Äù
If you had to give back the Grand Master Of Horror you also received in 2010 or the OBE, which would go?
‚ÄúI‚Äôd give back the Grand Master Of Horror because I know Steve King, who‚Äôs an old friend of mine, is the grand master of horror. He knows that I know, y‚Äôknow? The OBE is something that would have made my mother, had she still been alive ‚Äì so proud.‚Äù
Thanks for all the books, James Herbert.Commentary: It's Throw Season In New Orleans
It‚Äôs Carnival time in New Orleans, and that means that throw season has arrived. Throw as in the noun, a throw, not the verb, to throw. We‚Äôre talking about that time of year when revelers raise their arms in supplication for trinkets tossed from passing Mardi Gras parade floats.
Of all the things that make New Orleans one-of-a-kind, parade throws may well be the most idiosyncratic. I don‚Äôt know of any other place on Earth where this ritual of tossing and catching from krewe to crowd takes place. I‚Äôve been to Carnivals from Rio to Nice, and, while they have their own unique branding, they just don‚Äôt do it like they do here. When I took my own kids to the Macy‚Äôs Thanksgiving Day Parade, they scratched their heads in puzzlement. Why are people here when there‚Äôs nothing to catch, they wondered?
After four decades of riding in New Orleans parades as well as watching them curbside, I‚Äôve seen various Carnival throws come and go. Doubloons were hot, then not, and, recently, kind of hot again. Beads have gone from Czechoslovakian glass to Chinese plastic and back to glass again. They‚Äôve gotten more colorful, a lot longer, and a whole lot bigger.
This year, the New Orleans City Council has banned parade riders from throwing anything still wrapped in plastic. That may not reduce the environmental impact of the 20 million pounds of beads thrown from floats each year, but it will at least help keep the streets clear of the thousands of plastic bags that have gone over the sides with them.
A by-product of this change to the Carnival code is that krewes can no longer throw entire grosses of plastic-wrapped beads. Which is a good thing. You know that if you‚Äôre one of those people who has ducked for cover when a particularly ebullient float rolls by and throws become deadly parade projectiles. Years ago, when my daughter moved into an apartment on Henry Clay Avenue Uptown, she wondered why all the neighbors boarded up their windows during Carnival. She found out when Thoth rolled by, and over-zealous bead hurling shattered two of her front windows.
So the trend toward more eco-friendly and crowd-friendly throws is a good one. More and more riders (and everyone in Chewbacchus) are shunning petroleum-based products completely. Last year, the riders on my float in the Iris parade made the conscious decision not to throw beads. Really, NO beads. We threw butterfly wings, fanny packs, playing cards. But not a single strand of pearls. It felt a little like having Halloween without candy, or Valentine‚Äôs Day without the chocolate. This year, after some soul searching and by popular demand, we‚Äôre throwing just one special butterfly float bead. So I guess we‚Äôre kind of having our king cake and eating it, too.
For riders, throws ‚Äì the nouns ‚Äì are important. They can make or break the reputation of a Carnival krewe. Thousands of people turn out for those parades with ‚Äúgood‚Äù throws, like LED swords or blinking neon sippy cups. Sparta has an annual mystery throw. Endymion‚Äôs motto is ‚Äúthrow ‚Äôtil it hurts.‚Äù Bacchus is throwing light-up cowboy hats and bolo ties this year.
Zulu started the trend for signature throws more than a century ago with its hand-decorated coconuts. Muses picked up the idea in 2001 with hand-decorated shoes. Now Alla decorates genie lamps and Nyx embellishes purses. Excaliber has its wooden shields. Choctaw, its tomahawks. Centurions, its swords. For Okeanas, it‚Äôs crawfish trays, and for Carrollton, shrimp boots. Seriously. Anyway, you get the idea. Tucks has its trademark toilet paper, or course, but the City Council has degreed that it be biodegradable.
Some throws have mass appeal, while others, not so much. Anyone who rides will relate to the sheer power of holding aloft a toy spear and watching the masses surge in her direction. I love flipping frisbees and scattering bouncy balls, but no one much wants them nowadays. Stuffed animals never go out of style, though they, too, have to be bigger and fancier to charm the crowd. I have a giant pink flamingo that is going to drive paradegoers crazy before finally finding its way into some small child‚Äôs bedroom.
There‚Äôs an art to catching throws, too, a kind of crowd psychology of Carnival etiquette that is not so much stated as understood. Plush toys go to kids nearby; you don‚Äôt step in front of the short girl as the float nears; you don‚Äôt let go when you catch a strand of beads simultaneously with the tall guy next to you. It‚Äôs a contest.
I don‚Äôt need to tell locals that New Orleans girls never flash for beads. That‚Äôs the mark of an out of towner, for sure. Although not everyone follows the rules. Back in the ‚Äô70s, I stepped on a doubloon preparatory to bending down to retrieve it, and the girl next to me beat me to the ground and bit my ankle.
Bags of beads that break windows or people who maim to snag a throw have traditionally been a part of Carnival. But there‚Äôs a camaraderie to the throw culture, too. These days, with so much divisiveness and partisanship, that‚Äôs what I like about it. Whether you‚Äôre throwing from above or catching from below, you‚Äôre part of something big and fun and communal and totally in the moment. I‚Äôll take that particular stage any day.
Happy Mardi Gras to all of you.Lenin is dead. And so, if you hadn‚Äôt noticed, are Sidney and Beatrice Webb. But the political ethos they shared and its impact on the British Labour Party lives on. It is an ethos that may have been well meaning, but it is cold, insular, remote and bureaucratic and its time has gone. Yet it still has a grip on Labour‚Äôs psyche.
At its core it represents the politics of elitism. The people can‚Äôt be trusted and need to be lead by a pure vanguard who know what is best for them. A chosen few are the only people capable of making change happen. In Britain it has become Parliamentary Leninism and unless and until Labour decisively shakes its culture off the prospects for any transformative change to our nation are negligible.
This is where it has got us. At the last general election the Labour Party, the political formation that represents the politics or at least the hope of a democracy that is social, polled 29 per cent. This was one per cent better than Michael Foot managed as leader in 1983 ‚Äì a result that was not just the worse since 1931 but was so incompetently managed that it sparked the long march to modernization through Neil Kinnock, briefly John Smith and then finally Tony Blair and Gordon Brown.
The difference and similarities between 1983 and now are many but what stands out today is the scale of what has been lost; not an election but a way of being. After 1983 the path was difficult to walk but the direction seemed clear. Labour had to modernize ‚Äì its program and its organisation. Today the same direction of travel is being sought by the leadership ‚Äì there is a policy review ‚Äì just as there was in the 1980s and Labour is looking to renew its organisational form ‚Äì this time the solution is not one member one vote but citizens organizers. All of this is necessary but is far from sufficient if the Party ever wants to be in power again (and not just in office).
Social democracy is the organised political response to the negative social effects of capitalism. It is the political formation that allows certain groups of people to more effectively struggle against free markets and those who benefit economically from them. One of the main problems of New Labour was that it stopped trying to struggle because struggle only meant you lost elections. The capitalist tiger could not be tamed just ridden. So they convinced themselves that economic efficiency and social justice could go hand in hand. In a warped continuation of Crosland the game was now just about distributing the proceeds of growth. The social lamb could lie down with the capitalist lion. The crash was of course the wake up call on that decade and a half wild goose chase. The interests of capital and labour are not identical and the fact that the Labour Party had to be reminded of this feels strangely remarkable.
But even if Labour were to adopt a more realistic social democratic approach to political economy ‚Äì one that recognized the need for the regulation and democratic control of free markets ‚Äì the fall of New Labour signaled not just the failure of the Third Way but of the very mode of social democracy itself. For what New Labour never modernized was the operating assumption of social democracy ‚Äì that the game and the goal was control of the state, through a singular party and that through such control social democracy could be ushered in from above. As the central dictum of this Parliamentary Leninism goes ‚ÄòSocialism is what Labour governments do‚Äô. In 13 years, with the blessing of a largely strong economy (albeit one built on the quicksand of debt and a house price bubble), huge majorities and a pretty useless opposition, it did some good things and some bad things and we all have our little list, but what it proved beyond doubt is that that the days of social democracy by an elected elite, by a small group in a single party, are over.
Indeed they are long over. They were over in 1979 as the post war settlement finally unsettled. This reality of course caught up with actually existing socialism in 1989. But like mad men Labour kept doing the same thing expecting a different outcome. Deliver the leaflet, make the speech, get elected, pull the levers and hey presto ‚Äì socialism. We did it in 1945 and it worked and so we can do it again now? It is the politics of one more heave and has been a remarkably resilient mobilizing ideal given how useless it has been at delivering anything that has since transformed our country.
The 1945 moment captured the imagination of Labour and the party has been living off the vapors ever since. All political moments need their myths to sustain and guide them. But when a myth holds no basis in reality it becomes not a catalyst for change but a barrier. There are two problems with Labour‚Äôs 1945 myth. The first is that it is an imaged 1945. It is a 1945 that remembers only Clement Attlee, Nye Bevan and Herbert Morrison as the people who delivered socialism. Its forgets the unions, the friendly societies, the left book clubs and Clarion Cycling clubs, the socialist societies, the Methodists and of course the intellectual impact of Liberals like Keynes and Beveridge and even Tories like Butler. It was not a singular and elite entity that created the post war settlement, rather it was rich, deep and nuanced. But all Labour remembers is the Labour Party, or more precisely its leadership.
The second problem is even more profound and that is the horrible truth that 1945 was a unique and therefore unrepeatable moment. It came off the back of the Depression and a socially unifying war that meant even Churchill could not stop it happening. Critically it was the high water mark of Fordism and all the paraphernalia of mass production and mass parties that went with it. It was a moment to make a certain type of bureaucratic history because the conditions in which history could be made in this way were right ‚Äì but unrepeatable. All of the conditions of 1945 evaporated long ago.
This insight is of course far from new. Much of this was put forward around 20 years ago by the former Communist Party intellectuals around Marxism Today and the New Times project. They felt the death of Leninism more keenly than most. It is also captured in the brilliant 1996 Demos publication by John Gray After Social Democracy. Charter 88 was another vital response to the end point of this form of social democracy and they were more successful in getting at least elements of their programme on to the political agenda, not least because the ‚Äòold‚Äô Labour leader John Smith got at least some of the requirement for a new politics. Even with his death the moment was not gone. Blair at least effected to get it. He brought in Jenkins and cosied up to Ashdown ‚Äì but he let the moment to realign politics to the left go and today we pay the price with the realignment of the right.
So what does a post Leninist left look like? It‚Äôs not that hard to imagine. It is a political formation that respects more than anything the principles and practice of democracy. It shifts from democracy being a means to Labour government do and starts being what people do.
So not only would Labour re-ignite the constitutional reform touch paper set off by Charter 88, they would apply the test of democracy to every meaningful social and economic institution in the land; in public services, workplaces and communities. Power would rightly be regarded as plural rather than singular. Such pluralism would shatter the brittle and rigid structures of our adversarial political system in the recognition that change happens not by force but through argument, engagement, debate and discourse. It is the politics of the campsite; of clear identities but shared values. It is about winning allies, forging partnerships, coalitions and alliances. It is a war of maneuver not a war of position. It is Aesop‚Äôs sun not Aesop‚Äôs wind.
In all this, Labour in opposition must start in the only place it can, with itself. Labour has to democratize its structure and show it trusts its own members and supporters.
We can and must go on describing what a post Leninist politics looks and feels like; to make it tangible and seductive. That is part of the battle. What we want matters but what matters more is the conditions in which we want it. Are the conditions right for a shift to a post Leninist form of politics? Are the political and economic failure of New Labour and the birth of a centre-right Coalition the conditions in which Labour can junk vanguardism for good, or will there be one more ‚Äòone more heave‚Äô? The unpopularity of the Coalition and Clegg in particular makes the lazy assumptions of OMH attractive. If being in office is all that matters, socialism can be administered once again from on high, then why take a chance? But another round of bitter disappointment and inevitable failure in office if this mode of operation is repeated would be too much to bear.
The century of the centre is over. Centrifugal forces have become centripetal. The all-seeing, all-knowing hierarchy has had its day. What was linear, straight, and mechanical has given way to what is fluid, liquid, plural and complex. Under these new forces Britain itself is breaking up. Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland are more and more going their own way. New mayors are being elected across the land. Whatever we think of this process it is inconceivable that it will be reversed ‚Äì the only issue is how far will it go? The politics of one leader, one party and one state cannot hope to survive in this context.
This allows Labour to pick up on old themes and inspirations; of Levellers, Chartists, Diggers, of mutual‚Äôs, guilds and associations. Critically though, it gives permission and legitimacy to become part of the Facebook generation, where you join multiple groups and have multiple allegiances and identities. Where what matters is that you march against student fees and protest against corporate tax avoidance ‚Äì not what party card you hold or what leader you follow.
Later this year, Richard Sennett is to publish a new book beautifully entitled Together: The History, Rituals, Pleasures, and Politics of Cooperation. It will set the tone for the debate to come between a politics that is plural and a politics that remains singular and elite-driven. Between a future that is negotiated, and one that is dictated.. Leninism failed even in the era of mass society. The vanguard is hopelessly positioned today to control because there is no one to command. Lenin believed that you could force history. New Labour found that you can for a while but it inevitable unravels without a broad coalition of moral support behind and ahead of it. Meaningful and sustained change happens because of the people ‚Äì not against them. The challenge is to retain an ideological stance but practice it through pluralistic means. And to say goodbye to Lenin.

I believe that the course should focus more on storytelling techniques and less about how to edit audio and video.

The beauty of this course is that it is highly practical - you move through and step by step you build your own digital story. While it was developed for and presented to educators, the skills are applicable to individuals who want to improve their own digital storytelling.

Very usefull course and very helpfull in upgrading ourselves with a new skill.
por Rose C‚Ä¢
This is a very basic course. Yes, it's intended for k-12 teachers, but I was under the impression this course could be somewhat useful to professionals who want to implement digital storytelling in their work (i.e. marketing, tutorial videos, etc). I was expecting more robust tools, resources, and projetcs, and what I found was basic tutorials (really basic, like how to install Audacity!) and very basic tips. Perhaps, for real young students it can be a good starter.
The course is a little dated, too (2014? 2016?) -- I did not find the publication year in the Course Information, but one of the last videos seems to have the year 2016 on it and one narration mentions 2014. Well, many things have changed since.
The lessons were too "easy" and overly explained, with an extremely simplistic didactic method and vocabulary (quite proper for small kids). Thus, it was a little boring to hear the narration of the videos.
In Week 3, Reading Material (PDF), Item # 2 has a broken link: ‚Ä¢ Audio for podcasts, digital stories, and class projects. It goes to "page not found". So, the material needs some revision from time to time.
On the positive side, creating a script in 10 minutes to use it in a storyboard was a fun exercise! And some of the resources provided can be handy, such as a few links to reading materials and to copyright-free music and sounds.
The course was well made and thought of. It's not a bad course in itself; it's just too basic for professionals such as coaches, marketers, writers, and artists.
That said, I'd recommend this course only to people who know nothing or very little about softwares, digital tools, copyrights, and storytelling.

I am really glad, useful things. I would have missed it.. Glad I didn't. Only feedback is, the video stories on the digital storytelling website take a little time to play. And the interface looks a little old. Definitely a course for learning to make stories.

This was a very interesting course !
It is great if you want to deliver information in an interesting way,by learning how to record audio, source music and visual images and touches on copyright laws
All this information will help to make a great video presentation

It was a loud night at the Bikini Brothel. It was opening night and under the specialist and horny management battle to choose if the nearby newly painted building was going to end up being a country club bar, or remain a whorehouse. It was a battle that would decide if Michelle would be able to fuck her teenager idol Mark-Paul who had flown in unique for this night. To Kiko, it implied she would please her father and not be sent to penetrate a Hooters bar next. And since these things tend to happen, it began to rain.
Michelle stood up, a little shaken from the fall, but prepared prepared product. As they fell, Michelle reached for one of Kiko's coral brown nipples and twisted as tough as she could.

According to the company the technology has the potential to remove the industry‚Äôs dependence on manual annotation of test data that is created frame-by-frame, which can be both time-consuming and error-prone.
‚ÄúCurrently, many players in the autonomous vehicle (AV) field employ an army of people to manually annotate each frame of a video, LiDAR point or radar return to identify objects in the scene (such as other vehicles, pedestrians, road markings and traffic signals) to create training data,‚Äù said Matt Daley, managing director of UK-based rFpro. ‚ÄúThis new approach.‚Äù
rFpro calls the new approach Data Farming and compares it to Render Farming, which has revolutionised the economics of popular animation. The company says that Data Farming enables customers to build complete datasets that cover the full vehicle system, where every sensor is simulated at the same time. The data is synchronised across all sensors, which is essential when customers are employing sensor fusion to bring together data, for example from multiple 8K HDR stereo cameras, LiDAR and radar sensors at the same time.
The software enables scalable sensor simulations up to full vehicle system level, fully synchronised across all channels
Data Farming is already being utilised by existing rFpro customers, including global Tier 1 supplier, Denso ADAS Engineering Services. Francisco Eslava-Medina, a project manager at Denso ADAS stated, ‚ÄúThrough Data Farming we can create an extensive number of driving scenarios, allowing the generation of very large variations in scenes, all through the investment in a single platform. This allows us to quickly and cost-effectively generate the vast quantity of quality training data that is essential for certain product development phases of computer vision technologies, especially for neural networks for our autonomous vehicle technologies.‚Äù
rFpro says the approach permits customers to start with even a single PC, to perform a complex simulation involving multiple sensors. ‚ÄúSimulations don‚Äôt have to be run in real-time, offering flexibility to the user around the computing power required,‚Äù added Daley. ‚ÄúFor engineers, this puts it within a typical departmental budget, rather than requiring senior approval. High-quality training and test data is now far more accessible.‚Äù

Annual Biotech Investment Fantasy League Results
The Pittsburgh Pharmacy Investment Portfolio (PPIP) wrapped up its Biotech Investment Fantasy League (BIFL) competition at its annual Portfolio Presentations Event held via Zoom on December 2, 2020. BIFL is an organization-wide competition that allows members to build their own fantasy portfolio on a stock stimulator program, Investopedia, and compete for the highest-earning portfolio. By market close on October 9th, 2020, all participants were required to have 50% of their $50,000 allowance invested in healthcare, biotechnology, or pharmaceutical stocks. The competition ran through December 1st, 2020. The 10 top-earning portfolios were invited to present their portfolio selections and investment strategies to a panel of faculty judges. Winners were decided based on the rationale of investments, rather than the financial outcome.
Congratulations to first place winner Matthew Roth, second place winner Hyunwoo Kim, and third place winner Christopher Biser.

And, many judges are more likely to issue an emergency restraining order than to take the chance that someone may be harmed if one is not issued. The initial emergency restraining order can be issued without your knowledge and should not last more than ten days before you have an opportunity for a court hearing, which will provide you with an opportunity to oppose the extension of the restraining order. In the meantime, however, the initial restraining order places you in a disadvantaged position, especially if you have minor children. In an emergency order, not only are you precluded from entering your home or being within a certain number of yards from your spouse, oftentimes the order includes giving your spouse sole custody of your minor children. Your parenting time and your access to even talk to your children is obstructed until an evidentiary hearing is scheduled about ten days later. Therefore, when you hear these words or something similar from your spouse, it is important to consider what she/he really means and what plans she/he may be considering in order to gain the upper hand in a potential divorce action. Of course, if you have physically harmed or caused your spouse to be in fear of potential harm, then your actions have met the threshold requirement for the continuance of a restraining order and you should retain experienced counsel to help you navigate through this legal process, so you are able to resume parenting time with your.The Nigeria movie industry is yet recording several significant improvements, with fast rising Actresses and Actors who are working earnestly to lead a great and remarkable career in the Induatry.

The shipwrecks presented on this site lie beyond the capabilities of SCUBA. To work safely in Poseidon‚Äôs realm, the pioneering use of robotic technology is employed on wrecks.
Sites are discovered by towing side-scan sonar and magnetometer devices over large distances looking for anomalies in the seabed which can then be inspected further. Remotely Operated Vehicles (ROVs) outfitted with video cameras allow archaeologists on the surface ship to inspect the wreck without getting wet.
Before touching a wreck, its profile is recorded by telepresence. Multibeam sonar reconstruct a ship‚Äôs 3D contours. Thousands of photos are taken and digitally stitched together to provide a zoomable bird‚Äôs-eye view of a site. Sediments might be cored to assess a wreck‚Äôs buried survival or on the Victory warship (1744) sub-bottom imaging mapped the buried wreckage in 3D.
Surveying, recording and recoveries are all built around unmanned ROV‚Äôs (Remotely Operated Vehicles), the eyes and hands of archaeologists in the deep. These sophisticated robots are driven by hydraulic thrusters and can travel thousands of feet deep.
Deep-ocean pioneers Odyssey Marine Exploration built a proprietary archaeology ROV named ZEUS. This ROV.
Just like a physical grid on land, on the archaeological projects presented on this site, the team invented a digital grid to accurately log and map the position of every object from a tiny button to a large cannon. After artifacts are recovered, the story of a wreck is forensically reconstructed based on their original locations and contexts.

To be advised...
Venue: Hamilton Gardens Pavilion, Hungerford Crescent, Cobham Drive, HAMILTON
Vision
This conference has a prophetic and apostolic approach and encourages women to step courageously into the calling God has for their lives. Undefeated - A Call To Courage! God loves us and has made us to be creative according to how He has gifted us. Let God release you to be all He made you to be - a creative individual free from intimidation and the fear of man!
We aim to gather women from every denomination to worship, receive inspiring teaching and encouragement together. Lives are changed in this atmosphere of faith and you won't return home the same! See the Testimony page.
Whether you know Jesus or not, we welcome you to our Women of Courage conference which is not organised by a church but by Call To Courage Trust, a not for profit charitable trust.
There are four Keynote Speakers and also testimonies from New Zealand women. So come and be inspired and blessed at the Hamilton Gardens Pavilion venue. Will there be healings? - God is in the house! Gather your friends (group discount given for 10 or more) or come on your own and meet new friends. We look forward to seeing you there. ‚ÄúThe joy of the LORD is your strength.‚Äù ~ Nehemiah 8:10
What is the prophetic?
Throughout the Bible, we see God sending prophets to speak to an individual or a group for Him, as He did in Judges 6:8. Women Of Courage believes that the prophetic ministry is still operative today and that a true God-inspired prophecy can strengthen, encourage, and comfort the person who receives it (see 1 Corinthians 14:3).
The Word of God encourages us to welcome divinely inspired prophecy (see 1 Corinthians 14:1, 3, 4). Prophecy must be consistent with the Word of God, and a personal word of prophecy should confirm something that is already in your heart.
The speakers at our conference are known to move prophetically. This means they hear from God and may speak specific words of encouragement over individuals. This prophetic leading also flows through in their preaching, with Holy Spirit inspired revelation and encouragement.When you come to conference expect God to stir you and encourage you.

With 104 Engravings and 20 Plates printer's mark LEA & FEBIGER PHILADELPHIA AND NEW YORK 1909 Copyright, 1909 by the National Dental Association of the United States of America PREFACE. The idea of writing a History of Dentistry first suggested itself to me ten years ago, when I was charged by the Organizing Committee of the Eleventh International Congress of Medicine with the reproduction and description of all the appliances of ancient dental prosthesis existing in the museums of Italy. The highly interesting researches in which I then became engaged in order to carry out worthily the important mission intrusted to me, awoke in me the desire to gain still further acquaintance with all that relates to dental art in the time of the ancients. I was thus urged on to ever fresh efforts, not only in the discovery of prosthetic appliances and other objects of ancient dentistry, but in the study, as well, of dental literature and of all the written matter that might throw light on dentistry in past ages. This subject has already occupied many before me, and each one has brought to it his contribution of greater or less value, some in the form of short pamphlets, others in that of larger works. The end I proposed to myself was to write a History of Dentistry which should be much more complete, more circumstantial, and more exact than those published hitherto, and which, instead of being, as are many of these works, simply a compilation, should represent, at least in part, the fruits of personal research and scrupulous examination of a vast number of works of various kinds containing elements utilizable for the purpose. The first part of my work, which I now offer to the public, comprises the remote origin of Dentistry and its development throughout the ages as far as the end of the eighteenth century. In a short time I hope to publish the second part of it, viz., the History of Dentistry during the last hundred years. I have carefully collected the greatest possible number of historical data, keeping in view the consideration that some facts, although of little value in themselves, may possess a certain importance for the student desirous of procuring historical information relating to some particular point of dental science. If this book should, as I hope it may, contribute to the diffusion of exact historical knowledge as to the origin and gradual development of dentistry, my labor will not have been lost, for it will have realized the object, a highly practical one, which has guided me in writing it.

Every dentist who has ever given any thought to the development of his profession must have realized the growing necessity for an accessible and authoritative history of the dental art. The early efforts in this direction by Duval, Fitch, Carabelli, Snell, Linderer, Harris, and others, followed in this country by the more recent essays of Perine, Dexter, and Cigrand, are out of print and difficult to obtain. The Geschichte der Zahnheilkunde, by Geist-Jacobi, and Notice sur l‚ÄôHistoire de l‚ÄôArt Dentaire, by Lemerle, have given to the practitioners of Germany and France valuable information which the English-speaking dentist has often sadly lacked. Realizing this situation, at the first meeting of the National Dental Association, the late Dr. R. Finley Hunt offered the resolution: ‚ÄúThat a Committee of Three be appointed by the President to report at the next annual meeting a measure looking to the preparation of a full history of the Dental Profession.‚Äù After a careful consideration of the subject, this committee reluctantly concluded that, ‚Äúwhereas a complete history of dentistry may some day be the result of the effort now being made, this Association must confine its first attempts to the history of dentistry in America.‚Äù In a letter to the committee the late Dr. W. D. Miller said: ‚ÄúOf course, a universal history of dentistry would be very interesting and valuable, but its compilation would naturally cost an immense amount of labor.‚Äù Aside from this, it did not seem possible that the data for a proper history of the early development of the dental art in Africa and Europe could be collected by an association working in America. After several years of what may have seemed a policy of masterly inactivity the unexpected happened, and the committee was able to report at the Buffalo meeting of the Association that Dr. Vincenzo Guerini, of Naples, Italy, had written a history of dentistry from the earliest times to the beginning of the nineteenth century, and that this work, translated into English and fully revised, had been generously placed in the hands of the committee for publication under the auspices of the National Dental Association, in token of the distinguished author‚Äôs appreciation of American dental development. The Association, deeply sensible of this high compliment, and fully realizing this opportunity for accomplishing a purpose which had hitherto seemed impossible, gladly arranged for the publication of the book. After the delay incidental to the production of a work of this character, and the necessary subscribers being obtained, this exhaustive history of early dentistry, by the greatest authority on that subject in the world, is presented for the serious consideration of the thoughtful and studious members of the profession. Dr. Guerini has spent many years of his professional life and large amounts of money in collecting the material for this work. Our historical records are scattered through a vast literature, and much of it is of great antiquity, and it has never before been gathered together and arranged in such a consecutive, logical order. as set forth in Dr. Guerini‚Äôs book without developing a higher appreciation of their work and a keener realization of the worth and dignity of the calling which they in common with ourselves followed. It has been deemed wise to make a few amendments and commentaries, and when that has been done the amendment has in each case been inserted as a foot-note and designated by the initials of the commentator. The supervision of the work while passing through the press and the correction of proofs have been entrusted to Dr. Edward C. Kirk, of the Committee; the index has been prepared by the chairman.

The first beginnings of dental art were undoubtedly the same as those of general medicine, for it is evident that in primitive times, when the healing art was still in its rudimentary stage, no divisions could have existed in it. Scientific medicine, whose most ancient representative is Hippocrates, was preceded for the course of many centuries by sacerdotal medicine and by popular medicine. Necessity, instinct, and even mere chance must have taught primitive man some simple curative practices, in the same manner that they taught him gradually to prepare his food and to satisfy the other wants of life. It was in this way that popular medicine, which is found without exception among all races and is perhaps as ancient as man himself, had its earliest beginning. As regards sacerdotal medicine, it was principally derived from the false ideas prevalent among primitive peoples about the causes of maladies. When, for example, an individual in full health was seized with sudden illness, no one could imagine, in those times of profound ignorance, that this happened in a natural manner; the fact was therefore attributed to a supernatural cause, that is, to his having been stricken by the wrath of some divinity. In this state of things it was believed to be absolutely necessary to propitiate the inimical or vengeful divinity, so that the patient might be restored to health. It was, therefore, very natural that the intervention of sacerdotal aid should be sought, that is, of the supposed intermediaries between human beings and the gods. The priests, on their side, were ready to occupy themselves with such cases, for their services were always well recompensed, and, added to this, if the patient recovered, the respect and veneration of the people for the sacerdotal caste was considerably increased, whilst if he did not, this simply meant that he or his family was not worthy of receiving the desired pardon, or that, anyhow, the Divinity, for good reasons of his own, would not grant it. However, it being to the interest of the priests to obtain the greatest possible number of cures, they did not limit themselves merely to offering up prayers and sacrifices and to imposing on the patients the purification of themselves and other religious exercises; they also put into practice‚Äîalways to the accompaniment of ritualistic words and ceremonies‚Äîthe means of cure which their own experience and that of others suggested to them. The art of healing the sick was transmitted from generation to generation in the sacerdotal caste, acquiring an ever greater development and complexity in proportion to the making of new observations and fresh experiences. It is to be understood that in this manner the priests became more and more skilful in the treatment of disease; they were really the doctors of those times, albeit their curative practices were mixed up with an ample dose of imposture. This, at least in many cases, must have had, besides, the advantage of acting favorably on the patients by means of suggestion. We learn from Herodotus that the Babylonians used to carry the sick into the public squares; the passers-by were expected to make inquiries as to their illnesses, and if it so happened that they or any of their acquaintances had been similarly afflicted, to come to the aid of the patient by offering their advice and making known the means of treatment that had effected recovery, exhorting him, at the same time, to have recourse to them. This usage had without doubt its advantages, as it must have led, little by little, to the recognition of such remedies as were most efficacious, among all those recommended, against the various maladies. Another custom that served to furnish useful elements for the development of the art of medicine was that of the votive tables, hung in the temples by patients after their recovery, in sign of gratitude for having received the invoked blessings. These tables contained a brief description of the malady and of the treatment that had proved useful in dispelling it. If we reflect that dental affections are often of long duration and very tormenting, the thought naturally suggests itself that among the votive tables not a few must have referred to maladies of the teeth. The numberless cases recorded by votive tables afforded precious clinical material, which without doubt was utilized in a great measure by the priests in compiling the earliest medical writings, and, as we shall see later, Hippocrates himself stored up all the medical records existing in the celebrated temple of Cos.

DENTAL ART AMONG THE EGYPTIANS. Among the people of ancient times, the Egyptian nation was, without doubt, the one in which civilization first took its rise and had its earliest development. From the time of Menes, first King of Egypt (3892 b.c.), the inhabitants of the valley of the Nile were well advanced on the path of civilization, and under the fourth dynasty, dating from 3427 years before the Christian era, they had already attained a high degree of progress. Medical art and science in every country have always progressed in proportion to the general civilization, for the treatment of disease is one of the first and most important manifestations of civilized life. It is therefore natural that the healing art should have flourished earlier in Egypt than elsewhere, that is, in the midst of the oldest civilized people. There, as in other countries, medicine was practised for some time only by the sacerdotal caste; but not all the members of this caste were doctors and priests at one and the same time; there was a special class among them, called ‚Äúpastophori,‚Äù whose mission it was to cure the sick. Our knowledge of medicine as practised among the Egyptians of old is now no longer limited to the scanty notices handed down to us by Greek and Roman writers. The researches made by students of Egyptian lore have placed original medical writings in our hands, now already partly interpreted, that permit us to form a sufficiently exact idea of the science of Medicine in ancient Egypt. These valuable documents, denominated papyri, from the material on which they are written, now exist in great numbers in the Berlin Museum, in the British Museum, and in those of Leyden, Turin, Paris, and other cities; but the most important of the papyri treating of medical subjects is certainly the papyrus of Ebers, in the library of the Leipzig University.1 This very valuable papyrus‚Äîthe most ancient of all known works on Medicine‚Äîis the best written of all the Egyptian medical papyri, and is also the best preserved and most voluminous. In size it is 30 centimeters high, 20 meters long, and the whole text is divided into 108 sections or pages, each one of about 20 to 22 lines. The celebrated Egyptian scholar, Prof. George Ebers, procured it, toward the beginning of the year 1873, from an inhabitant of Luxor, in Upper Egypt. He published a beautiful edition of it two years later in Leipzig; and in 1890 Dr. Heinrich Joachim published a German translation of the whole papyrus, with an introduction and explanatory notes. The Ebers‚Äô papyrus is written in hieratic characters. We here reproduce some passages of it, so as to give our readers an idea of the style of writing.2 Lepsius and with him the greater part of Egyptologists are of opinion that the Ebers‚Äô papyrus is not an original work at all, but simply a copy of medical writings of still earlier date, belonging to different epochs, and which were collected and reunited to form a kind of manual on medicine. Fig. 1 Part of Ebers‚Äô papyrus in Egyptian hieratic characters containing three dental prescriptions.. From some indications existing in the papyrus itself, Ebers has been able to argue, with quasi certainty, that the papyrus was written toward the year 1550 B.C. But some parts of it have their origin in a far more remote epoch; they go back, that is, to thirty-seven centuries or more before the Christian era. In fact, at page ciii of the Ebers‚Äô papyrus3 one reads: ‚ÄúBeginning of the book about the treatment of the uxedu in all the members of a person, such as was found in a writing under the feet of the God Anubis, in the city of Letopolis; it was brought to His Majesty Usaphais, King of Upper and Lower Egypt.‚Äù Now, as Joachim remarks, the Usaphais herein named was the fifth king of the first Egyptian dynasty, and he reigned toward 3700 before the Christian era. Hence, it may be argued that some, at least, of the writings from which the Ebers‚Äô papyrus was taken were composed in the very remote epoch to which we have just alluded, or perhaps still farther, for it is impossible to know whether the book, deposited by unknown hands at the foot of the statue of the God Anubis, had been written but a short time previous or at a much earlier epoch. Fig. 2 hieratic characters containing eleven dental prescriptions. Part of Ebers‚Äô papyrus in Egyptian hieratic characters containing eleven dental prescriptions. Dental and gingival maladies are in no way neglected in the Ebers‚Äô papyrus. At page 72, a remedy is prescribed ‚Äúagainst the throbbing of the bennut blister in the teeth,‚Äù then two other remedies ‚Äúto cure the bennut blisters in the teeth and to strengthen the flesh (gum).‚Äù It is somewhat difficult to say what is meant by bennut blisters; but perhaps it means small, gingival abscesses of dental origin. The first of the above remedies‚Äîprobably meant to calm the pricking or throbbing pain that, in such cases, often accompanies the dental malady‚Äîconsisted of: ‚ÄúSeps-grains Part 1 Dough ‚Äù 1 20 21 Honey ‚Äù 1 Oil ‚Äù 1 To be applied on the part as a plaster.‚Äù The other two remedies, very likely intended for the cure of dental fistul√¶, were to be used as masticatories. The first consists of: ‚ÄúFennel seeds Part 1 Dough ‚Äù 1 Anest-plant ‚Äù 1 Honey ‚Äù 1 Incense ‚Äù 1 Water ‚Äù 1‚Äù The other was still more complicated and thus compounded: ‚ÄúD√¢m-plant Part 1 Anest-plant ‚Äù 1 Incense ‚Äù 1 Amaa-plant ‚Äù 1 Man-plant ‚Äù 1 Saffron ‚Äù 1 Aloe wood ‚Äù 1 Annek-plant ‚Äù 1 Cyperus ‚Äù 1 Onion ‚Äù 1 Water ‚Äù 1‚Äù At page 89 of the papyrus4 we find two other remedies, having the same object, that is, ‚Äúto cure the bennut blisters in the teeth and to strengthen the flesh.‚Äù The first is compounded in this way: ‚ÄúCow‚Äôs milk Part 1 Fresh dates ‚Äù 1 Uah corn ‚Äù 1 To be left stand and then to be masticated nine times.‚Äù This is the second receipt: ‚ÄúAnest-plant Part 1 Dough ‚Äù 1 Green lead ‚Äù 1 Sebests5 ‚Äù 1 Cake ‚Äù 1 D√¢m-plant ‚Äù 1 Fennel seeds ‚Äù 1 Olive oil ‚Äù 1 Water ‚Äù 1 To be used like the preceding one.‚Äù In this same page 89 many other remedies corresponding to various indications are prescribed. ‚ÄúTo strengthen the teeth: Powder of the fruit of the dum-palm Part 1 Green lead ‚Äù 1 Honey ‚Äù 1 To be mixed and the teeth rubbed with it.‚Äù The following is another remedy for the same purpose: ‚ÄúPowder of flint stones Part 1 Green lead ‚Äù 1 Honey ‚Äù 1 To be rubbed on the teeth.‚Äù Next comes a remedy ‚Äúto cure the growth of uxedu in the teeth,‚Äù that is: ‚ÄúDough Part 1 Beans ‚Äù 1 Honey ‚Äù 1 Verdigris ‚Äù 1 Green lead ‚Äù 1 22 23 To be powdered, mixed, and applied on the teeth.‚Äù The word uxedu recurs more than thirty-five times in the Ebers‚Äô papyrus, in relation to affections of the most different parts of the body. By confronting all the passages of the papyrus in which one finds the word uxedu, Joachim deduces that it does not indicate any special disease, but has the general signification of ‚Äúa painful swelling.‚Äù According to Geist- Jacobi, by ‚Äúgrowth of the uxedu in the teeth‚Äù may be understood an alveolar abscess and the consequent swelling of the surrounding parts. Another remedy is intended for ‚Äúthe cure of the tooth that gnaws unto the upper part of the flesh.‚Äù The translator of the papyrus remarks that by the ‚Äúupper part of the flesh‚Äù is to be understood the gum. The remedy would, therefore, correspond to the indication of curing a tooth ‚Äúthat gnaws or gives pain unto the gum.‚Äù But as one sees, even putting it in these words, the meaning is anything but clear. Perhaps the destructive action of the carious process, reaching as far as the gum, is what is here meant to be alluded to. Meanwhile here is the receipt: ‚ÄúCumin Part 1 Incense ‚Äù 1 Onion ‚Äù 1 To be reduced to a paste, and applied on the tooth.‚Äù Besides the remedies already given, the two following are prescribed for strengthening the teeth: ‚ÄúIncense Part 1 Verdigris ‚Äù 1 Green lead ‚Äù 1 Mix and apply on the tooth.‚Äù The other is compounded of: ‚ÄúWater Part 1 Absinth ‚Äù 1 To be used as above.‚Äù We next find a formula, preceded by this very vague indication: ‚ÄúChewing remedy for curing the teeth.‚Äù ‚ÄúAmaa-plant Part 1 Sweet beer ‚Äù 1 Sut-plant ‚Äù 1 To be masticated and then spit on the ground.‚Äù Another masticatory is intended to ‚Äústrengthen and cure the teeth,‚Äù and is compounded thus: ‚ÄúSaffron Part 1 Duat-plant ‚Äù 1 Sweet beer ‚Äù 1 To be masticated and then spit on the ground.‚Äù Finally, we have a medicament ‚Äúfor curing the gnawing of the blood in the tooth.‚Äù It is complicated enough, being compounded with: ‚ÄúThe fruit of the gebu Part 1/32 Onion ‚Äù 1/64 Cake ‚Äù 1/16 Dough ‚Äù 1/8 Anest-plant ‚Äù 1/32 Water ‚Äù 1/2 One leaves it to stand and then chews for four days.‚Äù But what meaning is to be attributed to the ‚Äúgnawing of the blood in the tooth?‚Äù It is almost certain that this figurative expression referred to the pain deriving from caries and pulpitis. It may have had its origin in the observation of two phenomena, that is, first of all, the pulsating character which the pain alluded to often assumes, and the eventual issuing of blood from the cavity of a tooth affected by caries and pulpitis, when the pulp is exposed. At any rate, the Egyptian doctors of remotest antiquity undoubtedly did not ignore the presence of blood in the interior of the tooth. From what we have related, it clearly appears that at that remote epoch many remedies were already in use for combating dental affections. These must consequently have been frequent enough, which demonstrates the erroneousness of the opinion held by some, who affirm, as does Mummery,6 that in ancient times diseases of the teeth were extremely rare. Besides this, it is fully evident, from the Ebers‚Äô papyrus, that at the time in which this was written, dental pathology and therapy were still in a very primitive condition, and formed a part of general medicine, from which they showed as yet no tendency to separate; so true is this, that the remedies intended for the treatment of the teeth do not constitute a special section of the work, but are to be found among medicaments of an altogether different nature. Thus, at page lxxii 24 25 of the papyrus7 we find, first, three remedies against the itch; then five remedies for the cure of pustules in various parts of the body; next an ointment and a potion for the bennut blisters in whatever part of the body they may occur; after this, three medicaments against the bennut blisters of the teeth; and lastly, a plaster for curing crusts and itching in whatsoever part of the body. One finds no mention of dental surgery in the Ebers‚Äô papyrus. No conclusions could be drawn from this fact if the work only spoke of medical treatment, for then it might reasonably be supposed that the compiler had purposely occupied himself with this subject only; but, on the contrary, the Ebers‚Äô papyrus frequently makes mention of operative interventions, and among these, of the use of the knife and of the red-hot iron for the treatment of abscesses and of certain tumors. Therefore, there being no mention made in the papyrus of any dental operation, not even of extraction, gives us reason to suspect that at that remote epoch no surgical operation was carried out on the teeth, and that, as yet, no instruments existed for practising extraction. In the time of the celebrated historian Herodotus, of Halicarnassus, who lived in the fifth century previous to the Christian era (about from 500 to 424 B.C.), that is, more than a thousand years after the time in which the Ebers‚Äô papyrus was written, the dental art in Egypt had made remarkable progress, and was exercised by specialists. In fact, in the second book of Herodotus we find the following passage: ‚ÄúThe exercise of medicine is regulated and divided amongst the Egyptians in such a manner that special doctors are deputed to the curing of every kind of infirmity; and no doctor would ever lend himself to the treatment of different maladies. Thus, Egypt is quite full of doctors: those for the eyes; those for the head; some for the teeth; others for the belly; or for occult maladies.‚Äù8 Having here had occasion to refer to the History of Herodotus, we will quote two passages of this famous work, which have a certain interest for our subject; ‚ÄúWhilst the tyrant Hippias, after having been driven out of Athens (510 B.C.), was marching against Greece at the head of the Persian army and had already arrived at Marathon, he happened one day to sneeze and to cough in a more vehement manner than usual; and he being already an old man, and his teeth all shaking, a violent fit of coughing suddenly drove one of them out of his mouth, and it having fallen into the dust, Hippias set to work, with great diligence, to search for it; but the tooth not coming to light, he drew a long sigh, and then said, turning to those who were standing by: ‚ÄòThis land is not ours, neither shall we ever be able to have it in our power; what clings to my tooth is all of it that will ever belong to me.‚Äô‚Äù9 In another part of the History, that is, in the ninth book, Herodotus recounts as follows: ‚ÄúWhen the corpses buried after the battle of Platea were already despoiled of their flesh, a curious fact was seen; for the people of Platea having collected the bones of those who had perished, there was found amongst them a skull altogether devoid of commissures, and composed of one single bone. A jaw was also found, the teeth of which, comprising the molars, appeared to be made all of one piece, as though composed of a single bone.‚Äù Relative to this last passage of Herodotus, we may remark, as does Stark, that the total synostosis of the skull bones is certainly very rare, but that, nevertheless, one has authentic examples of the same, not only in ancient but also in relatively modern times, witness the famous skull of Albrecht von Brandenburg, surnamed the German Achilles, who died in 1486, and was buried in the monastery of Heilbronn. As to teeth united together and forming a single piece, no example exists save in very ancient authors, for instance, in Valerius Maximus, who recounts a similar marvellous fact of Prusia, King of Bithynia, and in Plutarch, who attests to a similar fact in the person of Pyrrhus, King of Epirus. It is very difficult to establish within what limits the activity of the dentists alluded to by Herodotus was displayed. It has been affirmed by some that dental art in ancient Egypt was very far advanced, and that not only the application of artificial teeth, and even of pivot teeth, but also stoppings, were practised by the Egyptian dentists of those days. Here are some data on this subject: Joseph Linderer10 tells us that, according to Belzoni11 and others, artificial teeth made of wood and very roughly fashioned have been found in Egyptian sarcophagi. George H. Perine, a dentist of New York, in an article on the history of dentistry,12 says: ‚ÄúBoth filled and artificial teeth have been found in the mouths of mummies, the cavities in the former stopped with gold and in some cases with gilded wood. Whether these fillings were inserted during life for the purpose of preserving the teeth, or after death for ornamentation, it is, of course, impossible to say. That the Egyptians were exceedingly fond of embellishing their persons with gold ornaments and bright colored materials is a fact which has been clearly established, and the discovery of mummies‚Äîof exalted personages no doubt‚Äîsome organs of which were gilded and embellished with showy colors proves that their fondness for display accompanied them even to the grave.‚Äù To this may be added, that after an embalmment of the highest class13 it was usual to gild the eyebrows, the point of the nose, the lips, and the teeth of the corpse, and place a gold coin between the teeth, or cover over the tongue with a thin gold plate. Dr. J. G. Van Marter, a dentist in Rome, in an article on prehistoric dentistry,14 writes, among other things, that the renowned arch√¶ologist, Mr. Forbes, had seen mummies‚Äô teeth stopped with gold. The great defect of all the assertions referred to is that of not being accompanied by any element of proof, wherewith to demonstrate their truth. When, for example, we are told that Mr. Purland possesses, in his collection of antiquities, a tooth pivoted on to the root of a mummy‚Äôs tooth, the question suggests itself naturally: If this tooth is, as it appears, separated from the jaw of the mummy to which it is said to have belonged, how can we be certain that the tooth itself is 26 27 28 really that of a mummy? Until sufficient proof of this be furnished, we cannot but consider the above assertion as absolutely without value.15 The same may be said as to the assertions of Wilkinson and Forbes with regard to mummies‚Äô teeth stopped with gold. Where and by whom were these mummies found? And where are they preserved? Was the stopping, too, verified at the time of the finding of the mummy, in such a manner as to exclude all possibility of fraud, or was it discovered afterward, in circumstances such as to suggest the possibility of a mistification? It has, in fact, been reported16 that the pretended Egyptian stopping in a mummy existing in an English museum was nothing else than a practical joke, carried out, besides, in a very awkward manner. In opposition to the above assertions, we have the most absolute contradictory statements on the part of the most competent authorities. The celebrated Egyptologist, Prof. George Ebers, has only been able, in spite of the most accurate research, to arrive at completely negative results in all that has reference to the dental art of the ancient Egyptians.17 The distinguished craniologist Prof. Emil Schmidt, of Leipzig, who owns a collection of several hundred mummies‚Äô skulls, writes thus on the question now before us: ‚ÄúIn no jaw have I ever found anything that could be attributed to the work of dentists: no fillings, no filing or trepanning of teeth, no prosthesis.‚Äù18 Virchow, who also examined a great many Egyptian skulls, among which were several belonging to royal mummies, did not find any indications of dentists‚Äô work;19 and Mummery, as well, although he made the most conscientious researches on this subject, could not arrive at any positive results whatever.20 Between the affirmations of some and the negations of others, it is very difficult to say on which side the truth lies. For my own part, I fail to find that there is the least proof of the ancient Egyptians having known how to insert gold fillings and still less to apply pivot teeth. But at the same time I think it cannot be doubted that the Egyptian dentists knew how to apply artificial teeth. And even though it may not be possible to demonstrate this by direct proof, one is equally prone to admit it when one considers, on the one hand, the remarkable ability of the ancient Egyptians in all plastic arts, and, on the other hand, the great importance they attributed to the beautifying of the human body; so much so, that even in so ancient a document as the Ebers papyrus, one finds formul√¶ for medicaments against baldness, for lotions for the hair, and other kinds of cosmetics. Is it likely, therefore, that so refined and ingenious a people should not have found the means of remedying the deformity resulting from the loss of one or more front teeth? Fortunately, however, we are not bound to content ourselves with simple suppositions, for a well-authenticated arch√¶ological discovery made in the month of May, 1862, has put us in possession of an irrefutable proof. The discovery to which we allude is registered in Renan‚Äôs Mission de Ph√©nicie, and was the result of researches made in the necropolis of Saida (the ancient Sidon) by Dr. Gaillardot, Renan‚Äôs colleague in his important scientific mission. In a grave in one of the most ancient parts of the necropolis, Dr. Gaillardot found, in the midst of the sand that filled the grave, a quantity of small objects, among which were two copper coins, an iron ring, a vase of most graceful outline, a scarab, twelve very small statuettes of majolica representing Egyptian divinities, which probably formed a necklace, to judge by the holes bored in them. But among the objects found (which, together with that we are about to mention, are now in the Louvre at Paris), the most important of all is ‚Äúa part of the upper jaw of a woman, with the two canines and the four incisors united together with gold wire;21 two of the incisors would appear to have belonged to another individual, and to have been applied as substitutes for lost teeth. This piece, discovered in one of the most ancient tombs of the necropolis, proves that dental art in Sidon was sufficiently advanced.‚Äù22 Fig. 3 Ph≈ìnician appliance found at Sidon, as represented in a cut of Renan‚Äôs Mission de Ph√©nicie. To these words, literally translated from Renan‚Äôs work, we will only add the following considerations: Egypt was, in its time, a great centre of civilization, whose influence was strongly predominant in all the neighboring region, and especially in ancient Ph≈ìnicia and in its large and industrious cities Tyre and Sidon. The remains discovered in many of the Ph≈ìnician tombs would of themselves alone be sufficient to demonstrate luminously the enormous influence exercised by the Egyptian civilization on the life and customs of that people. Now, if there were dentists in Sidon capable of applying false teeth, it may reasonably be admitted that the dentists of the great Egyptian metropoli Thebes and Memphis were able to do as much and more, the level of civilization being without doubt higher there than in Tyre or in Sidon, or in other non-Egyptian cities. 29 30 31 32 CHAPTER II. THE HEBREWS. In the Hebrew literature, as principally represented by the Bible and by the Talmud, there does not exist any book on medicine. Notwithstanding the vicinity and the close relations of the Hebrews with Egypt, medical science never reached the degree of development among this people that it did in the land of the Pharaohs. In the Bible we do not find the least trace of dental medicine or dental surgery. Indeed, although the books of Moses contain a great number of exceedingly wise hygienic precepts, there are not any that refer directly to the teeth or to the mouth. We may therefore conclude, with a certain degree of probability, that the Hebrews had in general good teeth and that dental affections were very rare among them. The word tooth or teeth occurs in the Bible more than fifty times,23 but very few of the passages in which it is to be met with present any interest so far as our subject is concerned. That the Hebrews attached great importance to the integrity of the dental apparatus is plainly seen from the following verses of the book of Exodus (xxi: 23 to 27): 23. .... These legislative measures show clearly enough that among the Hebrews the loss of a tooth was considered a lesion of great gravity, as they thought it of sufficient importance to be named in the same category as the loss of an eye, of a hand, or of a foot. If anyone caused the loss of an eye or of a tooth to his servant, the punishment was the same in both cases; that is, he was obliged to give him his liberty, thus undergoing the loss of his purchase money. Beauty and whiteness of the teeth were also in great repute. Thus we read in the Song of Solomon (iv: 2): ‚ÄúThy teeth are like a flock of sheep that are even shorn, which came up from the washing; whereof every one bear twins, and none is barren among them.‚Äù In another part of the Song (vi: 6) he repeats these same words, thus giving it to be understood how great was his admiration for the beautiful teeth of his beloved. From various passages of the Bible, one perceives that integrity and soundness of the teeth was considered a prime element of force and vigor. In Psalm iii: 7 David says: ‚ÄúArise, O Lord; save me, O my God: for thou hast smitten all mine enemies upon the cheek bone; thou hast broken the teeth of the ungodly.‚Äù (That is, reduced them to impotence.) And in Psalm viii: 6 we read: ‚ÄúBreak their teeth, O God, in their mouth.‚Äù On the other hand, in one of the Proverbs of Solomon (xxv: 19), broken or decayed teeth are taken to symbolize weakness: ‚ÄúConfidence in an unfaithful man in time of trouble is like a broken tooth, and a foot out of joint.‚Äù (In the Latin translation, instead of ‚Äúbroken tooth‚Äù stands ‚Äúdens putridus.‚Äù Perhaps the corresponding expression in the Hebrew language, signifies in a general sense a decayed or injured tooth.) The uncomfortable sensation produced on the teeth by acid substances (teeth on edge) is to be found several times alluded to in the Bible. In the Book of Proverbs (x: 26), one reads: ‚ÄúAs vinegar to the teeth, and as smoke to the eyes, so is the sluggard to them that send him.‚Äù And Jeremiah says (xxxi:.‚Äù As is apparent, there is nothing in the passages quoted that can be in any way connected with the treatment of dental affections; neither is it to be wondered at, when one reflects that even in the Talmud‚Äîwhich is much less ancient‚Äî medicine in general is hardly at all spoken of. This famous code as to practical life is almost silent with regard to therapeutic medicine, and only recommends hygienic practices. An axiom of the Rabbi Banaah is worthy of note, and may be quoted here as bearing on the subject, and also because many Christians might be found to conform willingly thereto: ‚ÄúWine is the best of all remedies; and it is in places where wine is wanting that one is in need of pharmaceutic remedies.‚Äù24 33 34 CHAPTER III. DENTISTRY AMONG THE CHINESE. For above 4000 years science and religion among the Chinese, as well as their customs, have remained quite unchanged. The inhabitants of the Celestial Empire can vaunt a most ancient civilization; which is, however, altogether stationary; neither has their medicine made any progress, and its actual state represents with sufficient exactness what it was in primitive ages. In Europe, various works have been written about the medicine of the Chinese, one of the best being that of Dabry,25 taken from the most celebrated medical books of China,26 and which may be considered as a compendium of the medical science of this people. In this work we find two chapters relating to our specialty: the first of these (p. 286) speaks of toothache, the second (p. 292) treats of all the other dental and gingival diseases. The Chinese call the toothache ya-tong, and distinguish a great many varieties of the malady, that is: 1. Fong-je-tong. This kind of toothache is caused by sudden cold, and has the following characteristic symptoms: Red and swollen gums, which after a little time discharge purulent and fetid mucus; abundant salivation; acute pain; swelling of the cheek. It is to be cured with draughts, mouth washes, and various kinds of frictions. We consider it useless to give the particulars of the various receipts, because Dabry hardly ever translates the names of the drugs of which they are compounded. These formul√¶ are therefore incomprehensible by most people. 2. Fong-lan-tong. This kind of toothache is also caused by cold. The pain is very great, but the gums are neither red nor swollen. 3. Ye-tong. Is also produced by chill. The gums are red and swollen; there is no discharge of mucus; great pain, which is aggravated by cold liquids. If the malady lasts for some time, the gums end by becoming black, and the teeth are loosened; the pain becomes more intense in spitting. In this stage of the malady the sufferer no longer fears cold drinks, but rather desires them, to soothe the pain. The cure varies according to whether the malady be of recent or of old date; it consists in the use of internal remedies (pills, potions), or of frictions on the part where the pain is situated. 4. Han-tong. This is also owing to the action of the cold. Pains in the cheek and forehead proceeding from the teeth; no diseased condition either of the gums or of the alveoli. 5. Tou-tan-tong. Violent cough and toothache at the same time; difficulty in masticating. 6. Yn-hiue-tong. The gums are pale, or violet-red, hard and lumpy, sometimes bleeding; the toothache is continuous. Among the numerous remedies recommended against this malady (mouth washes, frictions, draughts, pills), one particularly deserves mention: it is the urine of a child used as a mouth wash. 7. Tchong-che-tong. Pain in the teeth after mastication; there is also sometimes excoriation of the gums; flow of purulent mucus mixed with blood; bad-smelling breath; the tooth falls; it is decayed, and one can perfectly well distinguish a small hole; the root is unsound; in extracting the tooth one sometimes brings away together with it a little white worm, with a black spot on the head, which can be distinguished by the aid of a magnifying glass. A remedy must immediately be administered to destroy these worms, otherwise the patient runs the risk of having his other teeth attacked in the same manner, and of their falling out. The remedies against this affection are most numerous, and belong for the most part to the oftentimes cited categories. One of them presents a certain interest, its basis being arsenic. In Dabry‚Äôs book it is described in the following manner: ‚ÄúArsenic (gr. 1.80), houang-tan (gr. 3.60); pulverize, mix with water, and with a part of the mass form a small pill, which put close to the aching tooth or into the ear, if afraid of the arsenic; then sleep. Cure certain.‚Äù 8. Toothache, the effect of general weakness, following principally on abuse of coition. It is to be cured by the use of internal medicine, or by local remedies to be rubbed on the painful spot. Some of the medicaments registered in this paragraph have reference to the special case, in which the teeth are loosened through excess of coition. Among others there is a prescription for a dentifrice powder for strengthening the teeth, to be used every morning. 9. Toothache following on a blow. It is to be cured by using a certain dentifrice powder, composed of six ingredients. Another medicament consists in heating about an ounce and one-half of silver in some recipient, and then pouring wine upon it, and rinsing the mouth with it. Besides these nine kinds of toothache, the Chinese doctors recognized a peculiar morbid condition of the teeth and their surrounding parts, which is thus described in Dabry‚Äôs book: ‚ÄúIt sometimes occurs, after recovery from illness, that convalescents, in order to acquire strength, drink too great a quantity of wine; and that this after a certain time produces a beginning of inflammation of the stomach. In such cases the teeth often fall out, the breath becomes fetid, and if the patient eats hot food, the empty alveoli as well as the cheeks are painful.‚Äù Various internal medicaments and dentifrice powders are prescribed for combating this morbid condition. One of these latter includes a great number of ingredients in its composition; among others, the bones of mice. 35 36 Mention is also made of certain remedies, to which recourse may be had at times, for allaying violent dental pains, of whatsoever kind, or whatever be the cause that occasions them. One of these remedies is composed of different substances (among them, garlic and saltpetre), to be pulverized and made into pills. If the pain be on the left side, one introduces one of the pills into the right ear, and vice versa. The formula is also given for a very complicated medicated powder, to be snuffed up in the left nostril if the person suffering from toothache be a man; in the right if a woman. Another powder is to be smelt with the right nostril or with the left, corresponding to the side on which the pain is located. Abscesses and fistul√¶ of the gums are spoken of as follows: ‚ÄúIt sometimes occurs that an abscess forms in some one point of the gum; this communicates great pain to the tooth near it; the abscess is white, with discharge of purulent matter.‚Äù The treatment consists in the use of different medicated powders, to be rubbed on the affected part. Two of the powders contain musk, besides several other ingredients. A lotion is also prescribed. In the next chapter the following affections are described: 1. Ya-heou. Gums are red, soft, and swollen, and a fetid and purulent matter exudes from them; the teeth are not painful; if the gums are lanced, blood of a pale red color flows from them in abundance. This malady is to be treated with various internal medicines and sometimes with scarification. 2. Ja-suen. Gums swollen; little by little they are corroded and destroyed by ulceration, which leaves the roots of the teeth bared; the patient has an aversion for hot food; continued pain in the teeth; discharge of purulent and fetid mucus; by the slightest exposure to cold the pain becomes very violent. This affection is to be combated with internal remedies and local treatment (frictions with medicated powders; application of an ointment of very complicated preparation). 3. Tchuen-ya-kan. The gums are painful for a few days; apparition of the root of the tooth; absence of ulceration. Children of five or six years of age are frequently exposed to this malady. The best means of cure consists in the extraction of the tooth. There are, besides, various internal and external remedies prescribed. One of these latter contains verdigris and three other ingredients. Among those to be used internally there is a decoction prepared with twelve different drugs, two of which are mint and rhubarb. The quantity of rhubarb is about seven and one-half grams; therefore, this prescription is certainly intended to act as a purgative. 4. Ya-ting. The right or left gum suddenly swells; a tumor forms of about the size of a grain of sorgo; in the beginning it is red, afterward black; severe pain in the cheek and neck; itching in the cheek; the tumor afterward bursts, giving exit to blood, and becomes black; it ought to be pricked directly (before it opens of itself) with a silver needle; blood of a violet color will flow from it, which should be left free course until it regains its ordinary color. The sufferer has at the same time pains in the stomach, great thirst, abdominal pains, and sometimes even delirium. 5. Ya-jong. Gums swollen and painful, abscess, fever, swollen cheeks; great thirst, and vomiting of a liquid kind; dejections dry. The treatment consists in the methodical use of certain medicines to be used internally, among which is rhubarb. If one neglects to make...

Abstract
During the last few years, the use of medicinal plants as an alternative to traditional medicine has soared considerably. The demand for some plant species largely exceeds the offer and supply for good quality products can be a serious problem. Soil-less greenhouse cultivation of medicinal plants would thus allow growers to market very high quality products, year around, in a pesticide free environment. Valerian(Valeriana officinalis) plants were grown in Investigative Greenhouse and Field of Ferdowsi University of Mashhad in IRAN (59 N latitude), and evaluated for their response to the field and soilless culture conditions. The main objectives of this study were to evaluate the potential growth of Valeriana officinalis using a NFT growing system and evaluate their profitability. The results showed that valerian studied was well adapted to the NFT system. After 50-120 days, root dry weight of Valeriana officinalis, was 4.4 times higher, in the NFT system compared to field growing plants. Also, the shoot dry weight of hydroponic growing plants were15.2 times higher than field-grown plants. Essential oil yield were 0.57% and 0.48% in NFT and field conditions, respectively.

Therefore, the Institute's researchers have links to various mathematics departments throughout the region, which offers many opportunities for cooperation and joint activities.
Show Research Groups & Research Projects
Additionally, RICAM also hosts a considerable number of externally funded projects that are related to the fields of expertise of the different research teams. This structure allows to include many young scientists in the Institute's research work, and makes RICAM highly flexible to react to new needs and trends.
Show Externally Funded ProjectsI don‚Äôt know what will or will not happen to the second part of the infrastructure package but at this point what we already have is a big deal (a ‚ÄúBFD‚Äù, if you prefer) and I want to spend another day talking about it.
Infrastructure week became the most popular punchline in Washington under Donald Trump. That is because his original plan was a supposed public-private partnership that was a scam that enough of the nation saw through. Under it the public would have financed the projects and selected private interests would have ended up owning the assets.
The last great infrastructure projects were under FDR as part of the New Deal and Eisenhower (with a significant assist from the late then-Senator Al Gore, Sr.) the Interstate Highway System. Under Ronald Reagan we neglected infrastructure as a budgeting gimmick and all presidents since then have largely followed suit. Effectively for my entire lifetime, with the somewhat exception of the Interstate Highway System, we have largely ignored infrastructure. Keep in mind I‚Äôve been retired for years.
1.2 trillion is a big number that few of us can relate to. To put it in perspective (and it works a bit differently in reality) that would fund 1,200 $1 billion projects. At $500 million the number of projects increases to 2,400 or 48 per state. We have 3,006 counties in America. That comes out to just under $400 million per county.
This is just the traditional (think roads and bridges) part of the infrastructure proposal. (I will admit I do not know what will happen with the so-called social infrastructure package; but I‚Äôll be watching and commenting.) Everyone benefits under the package we already have. The only possible exception I could think of was a recluse. But even they benefit because the goods they consume travel over those roads and bridges. Think of what a collapsed bridge costs the economy.
The ‚Äúgreat achievement‚Äù of the Trump administration was the Trump Tower Tax Cut. I call it that, (purloined from Chris Matthews), because basically you had to be wealthy enough to afford to live in Trump Tower to benefit from it. That package cost American taxpayers $1.5 trillion or $300 billion more. Unlike the Biden infrastructure package, it did almost nothing to benefit the economy or average American.
Let‚Äôs take a brief look at how it got from concept to legislation. Every Democratic Senator and all but 6 Democratic members of the House voted for it. 19 of 50 or 38% of Republican senators voted for the bill. 13 of 213 or .06 % of Republican House members voted for the bill for an overall Republican congressional delegation support of 32 out of 263 or 12%. Even on the most generous curve that has to be a failing grade.
This is a big deal! (The use of Joe‚Äôs caught on a hot mike adjective is optional.)

She asked him about the current impact of COVID-19.
Backed by temporary insurance guarantees, the TV sector barely stopped production, unlike features, which were severely impacted. In the last twelve months, 1300 new shows were commissioned in the Asia-Pacific and more than 700 in both Europe and the United States.
Compared to 2019, production commencements are up by 40%. But a deeper take reveals that US productions dropped by 21% in both 2020 and 2021, though they are now rising solidly. South American countries are still flat and down by 60%, which is a tragic loss.
The rising numbers are partly explained by a significant change in the type of show. These are 6-8 hour miniseries rather than long-form dramas, or franchise series. He doesn‚Äôt provide the number of hours, but that is rising as well.
Read: Series Mania maps Australian sales and global opportunities
Australia has been very stable with neither a real drop or a real peak. But Denmark, which Pelinard-Lambert sees as comparable, has doubled the number of shows, and Turkey is producing four times more series than Australia. The reasons are to do with an export market eager for pro-family dramas and a keen sense for quality soaps, so distinctive they have their own name, ‚Äòdizis‚Äô.
A strange kind of turmoil
‚ÄòFor the last ten years,‚Äô he said, ‚Äòeveryone is expecting the bubble to burst, that too much money, too much stuff is produced all around the world, not enough time to see everything.‚Äô That is a recipe for pessimism, in which cable and terrestrial television continues to die, starved of revenue, outclassed by a few streaming companies which take over the world.
But he argues that some budgets are completely outrageous ‚Äì US$150 million per show in some cases. They will have to come back to earth because there is a ceiling for the number of subscribers and costs will collide with earnings.
‚ÄòThis is where the big problems will arise, when platforms fight to give more content to their subscribers, but are also trying to reduce the cost of their subscriptions. Even if there is this kind of golden age, it is still a golden age.‚Äô
By definition, golden ages fade away.
But that slow armageddon is simply not happening. Said Pelinard-Lambert, ‚ÄòAt at the same time, when you are asking commissioners, or platforms or traditional players, they are asking for more. You need to feed the beast, but the beast is not completely fed.‚Äô
The American push into Europe
As the US streamers build their own niches in Europe, they confront the unwelcome reality of regulation. The European Parliament is carrying out its threat to ensure that 30% of their content has to be locally produced. At the main Series Mania in August, HBO, Disney+ and HBO Max held keynotes, and announcing well over fifty new commissions.
Just a few weeks ago, said Pelinard-Lambert, ‚Äòin Europe, they were all having at least 30%, or 40% of their commission based on very known properties, either books, previous films, previous series or famous names, that would be able to carry some kind of image recognition for marketing.‚Äô
Channel Four is being privatised, the BBC is under assault from its own government, and the Brits are no longer included in pan-European deals. Indeed, one of the reasons why the EU has passed restrictive legislation is to keep English productions out. As a result, the Brits are doing more business with the US and their shows have become more Americanised.
Pressure to take risks
Around the world, the earlier pioneers are seeing a demographic change. They started by tempting younger audiences with teen dramas and sci-fi, but are now commissioning more adult content as those subscribers age out of those tastes. Amazon, for instance, is rebooting Packed to the Rafters in Australia.
We are also seeing an artificial shortage created as the major studios set up their own exclusive streaming services so the older services need to find replacements. We now know which classic shows are really valuable, and we have seen fierce bidding wars as rights deals expire and beloved properties are wrenched away from their familiar homes.
All this is creating a fascinating pressure on local and regional players, particularly the public broadcasters. They need to be more daring.
This leads to a kind of swap, with Netflix and Amazon wanting that more staid material which the smaller players lived on five years ago, while public broadcasters et al are taking up youth-focused programs. Sci fi, for instance, ‚Äòis no longer the private property of the big platforms‚Äô. Mind you, he acknowledged, the budgets are much lower.
They will still be under pressure to do big shows, but, ‚Äòwhen you are producing locally, you‚Äôre producing with something that can be understood, and can be recognised immediately by your local audience, because you want to be seen as a local player.‚Äô
Changing deals
The baseline budget for a regular prime time show in Europe is roughly one million euros per hour, topping out at four million, but with very large shows at six million. Budgets are climbing because agents are pushing valuable talent into television as the film business stalls with Covid. ‚ÄòBig names are now everywhere.‚Äô
The result is financial turmoil. Pelinard-Lambert is reporting on a new production company, or a sale or merger or first look deal every day. It is easy to start a production company, it is enticing, and the finance is readily available. At the same time, the bigger companies are buying each other, and harvesting the indie companies. Everyone has some kind of attachment to a major player.
Public broadcasters are leading the trend to joint ventures and co-productions across Europe, to stitch together budgets to match the larger corporate players. ZDF, France Televisions and the Italian RAI have formed The Alliance, a joint venture to make over forty shows in five years, averaging between two and four million euros/episode. The physical market is coming back to life, as production partners need to make real human contact as they make deals which are complex, vital and require a lot of trust.
Marketplace evolution
In the last few years, production markets like MIPCOM have been drooping a bit, as the market matures and more deals are set up online. But now they are back on centre stage, pumped up by that need to replace the content sequestered by exclusive deals, and a host of new players eager to establish themselves in this expanding market.
‚ÄòPeople are absolutely open to co-productions, and most of the original platforms are doing a lot of co-pros,‚Äô said Pelinard-Lambert. ‚ÄòViaplay is a Scandinavian platform which is really successful and has launched worldwide. 60% of the commissioning is done with foreign partners.‚Äô
Selecting the right distributor is even more important. ‚ÄòThere are a lot of independent distributors,‚Äô he said. ‚ÄòThey are getting bigger and bigger because the large companies like Federation or Fremantle are representing world wide [rather than territory by territory], or representing the production companies in their group, so they are not going to be selling on behalf of independent producers.‚Äô
So the independent producers need players who are hungry, who will take on a challenging sell. German company Beta Film, for instance, has built an amazing catalogue which comes from all over the world. Doing business with British companies is more difficult, as the Europeans note a national capacity to feel superior and lecture their partners.
The curse of lifestyle television
Selling into a global market is complicated by the way in which different cultures and broadcasters use their content. Cooking and dating shows in Australia are stripped across the week while the the Europeans run them once a week. To Pelinard-Lambert, the dominance of reality TV and games shows in Australian television is staggering, and brings a difficult problem for producers.
I.‚ÄôFran√ßois-Pier Pelinard-Lambert
Those shows don‚Äôt travel, because they are appointment viewing, and they don‚Äôt work unless you don‚Äôt know the outcome. A European outfit like the French equivalent of Channel Nine was tempted into studio shows, but ultimately stuck to three original dramas per week, which have much better sales and format opportunities globally.
As long as we are caught by this addiction, the international market will get harder as we are swamped by eager producers backed by cultures which do produce drama at the necessary scale. To Pelinard-Lambert, ‚ÄòI.‚Äô
We all know that the reasons why are very sad. Murdoch lurks like an evil toad, and the voters don‚Äôt seem to respond to the cultural argument.It‚Äôs Now Politically Trendy to Lambaste Your Own Mega-Donors
But as candidates go on the attack, they risk alienating supporters they may need and opening themselves up to charges of hypocrisy.
2016 presidential contenders are increasingly criticizing the outsized influence of money in politics‚Äîin some cases taking aim at the very donors that candidates may need to win the White House.
Sen. Ted Cruz became the latest hopeful to attack that flood of money‚Äîin words, if not in action‚Äîwhen he said in a speech on the Senate floor Monday that elite Republican donors were out of step with the conservative base.
‚ÄúA very large percentage of the Republican donors actively despise our base, actively despise the men and women who showed up and voted you and me into office,‚Äù Cruz said, adding, ‚ÄúI can tell you when you sit down and talk with a New York billionaire Republican donor‚Äîand I have talked with quite a few New York billionaire Republican donors, California Republican donors‚Äîtheir questions start as follows: First of all, you‚Äôve got to come out for gay marriage, you need to be pro-choice, and you need to support amnesty.
‚ÄúYou wonder why Republicans won‚Äôt fight on any of these issues? Because the people writing the checks agree with the Democrats,‚Äù Cruz added.
Cruz speaks from experience. One of Cruz‚Äôs biggest backers is a New York Republican billionaire: Wall Street hedge-fund magnate Robert Mercer, who has already given $11 million to a super PAC supporting the senator. Cruz also found himself in a dustup in April after The New York Times reported that he attended a fundraiser at the New York home of two gay businessmen where he apparently showed a softer tone on same-sex marriage. One of the hosts eventually called the decision to welcome Cruz ‚Äúa terrible mistake.‚Äù
Cruz‚Äôs comments Monday stand out at a time when presidential campaigns are rushing to amass as much money as possible as the primary season drags on. They also arrive as the latest in a wave of anti-big-money sentiment on the campaign trail, a rallying cry taken up by both Democrats and Republicans.
Donald Trump has also leaned on first-person experience to attack the corrupting influence of money in politics, a refrain that has won him fans on both sides of the aisle and helped bolster his reputation as a candidate unafraid to attack the status quo in Washington. ‚ÄúI will tell you that our system is broken,‚Äù Trump said defiantly during the first Republican presidential debate. ‚ÄúI gave to everybody. When they call, I give. And do you know what? When I need something from them two years later, three years later, I call them, they are there for me.‚Äù
That message appears to be drawing imitators, like Cruz, among the Republican 2016 contenders who want to emphasize outsider status. But most candidates lack Trump's financial heft. As a result, attacks such as Cruz‚Äôs recent comments highlight an awkward tension inherent in simultaneously benefiting from big money and attacking its influence, a delicate balancing act that much of the field now faces.
That balancing act exists in the Democratic primary race as well. Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders have made limiting the influence of big money in politics a key part of their campaigns for the Democratic nomination, while outsider candidate Lawrence Lessig has made it the defining issue of his campaign.
In an attempt to inoculate themselves against any criticism that they too are part of a corrupt system, Sanders and Lessig have both leaned on small-dollar donations to buoy their White House bids.
Taking a page out of that playbook‚Äîand working to capitalize off the candidate's anti-mega-donor rhetoric ahead of a looming Federal Election Commission filing deadline‚Äîthe Cruz campaign launched what Team Cruz is calling ‚Äúthe world‚Äôs first presidential crowdfunding platform‚Äù on Tuesday.
‚ÄúWho says political campaigns are only funded by individuals with deep pockets?‚Äù the website asks before proclaiming: ‚ÄúCruzCrowd is a threat to the Washington cartel and that is why WE are urging you to join our cause.‚Äù
Cruz and Trump are far from the only 2016 Republicans to push back against the influence of money in politics. Chris Christie has called for transparency around political contributions. And Lindsey Graham has expressed support for a constitutional amendment to overturn the 2010 Citizens United Supreme Court verdict, which paved the way for corporations and labor unions to spend unlimited amounts of money in an attempt to influence election outcomes.
But most of the 2016 candidates are raking in major-dollar donations even as they speak out against them. Cruz‚Äôs presidential bid has benefited from an array of elite mega-donors, beyond just Mercer. Five of the top 10 million-dollar donors in the 2016 presidential race have doled out dollars in support of Cruz‚Äôs White House run, including private-equity investor Toby Neugebauer, as well as fracking billionaire Farris Wilks and his wife, Jo Ann.
Clinton has also faced intense scrutiny as she courts mega-money and calls for an end to its outsized influence, a tactic that her aides defend as a recognition that in order to rewrite the rules, you have to first play the game.
Many Americans support the idea of limiting the power of political donations, though the issue rarely ranks near the top of the agenda. According to a January survey from the Pew Research Center, 42 percent of the American public rated ‚Äúdealing with the role of money in politics‚Äù as an important issue for the president and Congress.
For candidates like Cruz and Clinton, railing against mega-donors and the outsized influence of money in politics may win admiration from some voters. But it inevitably draws attention to the fact that they are also inextricably linked to the political establishment with which they find fault.Do you dream about the nail business you‚Äôre ‚Äògoing‚Äô to have someday? Maybe you tell yourself-
‚ÄúI‚Äôll do it as soon as I get some free time‚Äù or
‚ÄúOne day I‚Äôll grow my online presence for my business‚Äù. or maybe the fear and doubt make you feel stuck.
Hey listen‚Ä¶. I get it. These days, our plates are full with so much to do on the daily. Kids activities are driving you cuckoo, the never ending house chores, walking the dog, shopping, that laundry won‚Äôt do itself, spending time with family, friends our partners and now lets add on our business on top of aaaalll that. Phew chile‚Ä¶ *wipes sweat off my brow- we truly are super heros, aren‚Äôt we??
The one thing that we really have to remember though, is that opportunities don‚Äôt come while we‚Äôre sitting around doing nothing, in our free time. Let‚Äôs be honest, do you want to be that lazy nail tech who just lies around looking cute, chillin‚Äô at the house with snacks and Netflix, while other techs actively work on and grow their business, every spare minute they can? Can I get a HELL NOOOOO?!!! The world stops for no one, and in this race called life, it‚Äôs ultimately up to us if we finish strong or give up.
Reality check:
I have never heard anyone procrastinate their way to success before and I doubt it‚Äôs going to change any time soon. You‚Äôll never be ready. You‚Äôll never have more free time. Timing will never be just right. Fear will always be present when you need to step out of your comfort zone.
Tough Love:
It‚Äôs time to get a grip on your yourself and your business, friends. Successful Pro‚Äôs don‚Äôt wait to take action on their business. Here‚Äôs some quick tips to get you started.
1- WRITE‚Äì write every single goal, desire & dream. This is a pen to paper exercise, guys, no phones or computers allowed. When you write things down on paper, you are in full focus on what you‚Äôre writing. What ever we put our attention on, increases it‚Äôs vibration and ultimately manifests. (one step to manifestation which we‚Äôll talk about another day üôÇ
2. CHOOSE‚Äì if you‚Äôre anything like me, you have a list of goals and dreams the size of Santa‚Äôs naughty girl list. But today, I want you to pick just one of those goals. One goal that you know you can achieve fairly quickly or pick one that will get you closer to dream job.
3. DEADLINE‚Äì make a deadline of how long it will take you to achieve that one goal. Write it on your calendar, post it notes in the bathroom,, ask a friend to be your accountability partner‚Ä¶ whatever you need to do, to stick to it!
I go into full detail of goal setting, mindset and manifestation in the Nail Streetz Academy. The first of it‚Äôs kind, Business Membership Program for nail pro‚Äôs to help start, grow and create the career of their Dreams. yup..it‚Äôs gonna blow you away guys!

‚ÄúPrevious road vulnerability studies have looked at road surface flooding, but groundwater has not been addressed,‚Äù says Jayne Knott, a civil engineering doctoral candidate in UNH‚Äôs College of Engineering and Physical Sciences and lead author of a study recently published in Transportation Research Record, the journal of the Transportation Research Board of the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine. ‚ÄúWe found that the effects of surface water flooding on roads occur within a mile of the coast, and groundwater rise effects can occur more than twice that.‚Äù
‚ÄúThe worst enemy of pavement is water. If the soil and substrate under the pavement get wet, then the strength that we had counted on to carry the traffic isn‚Äôt there anymore.‚Äù

Details of the desulfurization for molten Ni-base superalloys containing Al using solid CaO have been investigated, and the formula that explains the reaction rate has been developed. A cylindrical CaO rod was inserted into 500 g molten Ni-base superalloy TMS-1700 (MGA1700) containing 200 ppm S and held for a certain period at 1600 ¬∞C in each experiment. Sulfur content in the melt decreased with the increasing holding time of the CaO rod. Results of electron probe microanalysis show that Ca, O, S, and Al distribute in the same part of the melt/CaO interface as well as the particle boundaries of the CaO rods. The distribution of these elements suggests that CaO reacted with S in the melt to generate CaS, and Al reacted with O and CaO to form calcium aluminate slag. The desulfurization rate formula was obtained by the assumption that the rate-controlling process of the desulfurization is S diffusion through the generated layer composed of CaS and calcium aluminate slag. This formula expresses the amount of S in the melt by the diffusion term with the effective diffusion coefficient, which was obtained from the experimental results. Moreover, the time required for the desulfurization of 2 kg molten Ni-base superalloy PWA1484 using a CaO crucible, was calculated by this desulfurization rate formula which resulted in fair agreement with the actual result.Motorola Droid Razr HD vs Samsung Galaxy S3 Decision Time
I‚Äôm pretty sure that most know the current must have Android smartphone in the mobile space is the Samsung Galaxy S3; however there is of course the latest Android smartphone from Motorola to take into consideration, the Motorola Droid RAZR HD, which could give the Galaxy S3 a run for its money.
Thus the big question is should you purchase the Samsung Galaxy S3 or opt to wait until the Motorola Droid RAZR HD hits the mobile space?
So with this in mind, Motoring Crunch have compared the specifications of the rumoured Motorola Droid RAZR HD to that of the very popular Samsung Galaxy S3 to see if it is worth waiting for the Motorola handset to arrive.
So starting off, the Galaxy S3 sports physical buttons whilst it is said the Droid RAZR HD relies on the on-screen buttons of Android Ice Cream Sandwich, and they say they prefer the RAZR HD because the device is more ‚Äòfuture proof‚Äô as the Google guys intend devices to be designed in this way after Android 4.0.
The rear of the Galaxy S3 is plastic, whilst the RAZR HD has a Kevlar back plate suggested by leaked images, and thus the Droid RAZR HD is more impressive in terms of durability and looks. When it comes to the battery the SGS3 with its bigger screen has a 2100mAh battery, whilst the smaller screen RAZR HD is said to sport a 3300mAh battery.
Then the guys say you have to take into account Blur and TouchWiz, as they say TouchWiz on the Galaxy S3can be mistaken for running Android 2.3 Gingerbread, whilst Blur is on the Motorola Atrix HD and maintains the blue overtones of ICS along with looking superb in videos.
Lastly it comes down to cameras, the Samsung Galaxy S3 as we know offers an 8 megapixel camera, whilst the rumour is the Motorola Droid RAZR HD is said to sport a 13 megapixel snapper. In the end the guys say both devices are a good choice, but it might be worth taking a look at the RAZR HD once it hit.
What would our readers do if they have not got the SGS3 yet, will they opt for the Samsung Galaxy S3 or will they wait for the Motorola Droid Razr HD release?
17 thoughts on ‚ÄúMotorola Droid Razr HD vs Samsung Galaxy S3 Decision Time‚Äù
√Ç I have an Iphone 4 and I‚Äôm due for an upgrade in October I would totally consider getting the Droid over the iphone 5
i had the iphone3gs and moved to the droid x and never looked back‚Ä¶the only thing i missed were two apps‚Ä¶charadium and eliminate pro‚Ä¶hopefully those will be hitting android before too long
Razr HD Hands down. √Ç My upgrade date was April 12th and I‚Äôm waiting for this bad boy. I‚Äôm guessing October.
dude my upgrade was middle of april too and im waiting for the razr hd as well
lol ive been waiting since April as well‚Ä¶ugh i wish theyd hurry up‚Ä¶i dont understand why people dont like moto so much‚Ä¶i prefer their phones much more than the competitors but i guess thats just my preference√Ç
√Ç People hate Moto because they don‚Äôt look after customers at all.Still no ICS update for Razr in Europe.They promised in February 12,then Q1,then Q2,then July.Now the are saying it‚Äôs going to be August‚Ä¶They are hopless
Razr HD.√Ç The S3 is nice but the screen is not that bright.√Ç The Razr Maxx is better than the S3 IMO because of battery.√Ç Battery is important.√Ç These things are mobile and you should not have to constantly tether to power.
I got the S3 and returned it because it was a terrible phone. I was constantly irritated with Samsung‚Äôs UI and voice quality. I‚Äôm out the restocking fee, and now I‚Äôm rocking my original droid x.
I bought a Motorola Droid Razr last week. My last phone was a Nokia, I bought just before the first Razr began selling. Ugh. So many testicles, but Consumer Reports in February, 2012, equalizes it and Samsung Galaxy. My naivete almost made me return it, but it had better last a long time. Verizon is the man in West County Sonoma, so that was my reason.
I‚Äôm so glad to read others didn‚Äôt like the S3. √Ç I just returned mine as well. √Ç I was due for an upgrade LAST September so I will continue to wait and continue to use my Droid2 which barely works. √Ç I wanted to love the S3 but it had some weird quirks that I didn‚Äôt like. √Ç Oh well.√Ç
Got tired of waiting for the Razr HD. Got the S3 instead and I‚Äôm loving it.
Motorola is a JOKE at best. Software wise the Galaxy S3 is the trend setting device that manufacturers will be chasing for the next 9months. Samsung trumps anything made by Motorola‚Ä¶.
Just looked up some rumors about the Razr HD.√Ç If it is true that it has a built-in battery a la apple products, then I am glad I went with the S3.√Ç Hated the keyboard, but downloaded the swype beta (which works beautifully).√Ç The physical button for me is a good navigation point when not looking.√Ç True, the phone I wanted was the Note (I used tablet PCs with wacom digitizers, and I use my phone mostly for web browsing/texting/hotspot and rarely for talk), but I will not go to AT&T for any reason.√Ç Overall, the RAZR looks like a good phone so I am sure it will be popular.√Ç For me, the S3 edged it out.√Ç (Plus my hotspot never worked with my LG Revolution, so to end the frustration I had to upgrade sooner rather than later.)
Complete waste of my 5 mins reading this review
I am up for an upgrade and opting to wait and see comparisons between the two phones. 8mp with slightly better optics vs 12mp with slightly worse optics. Motorola is more future proof and keeps a more futuristic, blue, professional look. Build quality: splash√Ç resistant kevlar vs plastic, and the so far unknown amount of RAM on the Droid RAZR HD.
√Ç Motorola is the worst company in Europe if you take into account updates and after sale support.I would avoid it
I have the RAZR, just bought s3 for the wife. Played with s3 for a day b4 i gave to her. The s3 is terribly slow in comparison as far as downloads, the web etc. the reception was terrible. If want to buy a camera that you occasionally text and make calls from the s3 is for you. Why does no one mention the lapdock capability of the RAZR? Worth noting also is that my RAZR is LOADED with apps i use to run my business and still blew the doors off the s3 performance wise. Samsung pokes fun at the iPhone yet it is marketed to the same fools who buy apple garbage. Bottom line, I‚Äôve used both, if you need speed and performance there is only one choice RAZR.

I've sat down to write a couple posts here and there and either can't finish or fear coming off as sounding tone deaf to those who are suffering.
We are a country that loves to profile, stereotype, leap to conclusions, assume everyone within a particular demographic thinks the same, troll and clap back. Even trusted journalistic sources mis-inform, either unintentionally because the stories are moving so fast, or deliberately because they have their own agenda to push forward.
When it gets overwhelming I get quiet, partially out of fear for saying the wrong thing, however unintentionally, and partly because there are no easy answers or quick fixes. The rants of "If you don't..." or "You should..." are fueled by emotion (totally understandable), but complex issues require critical thought. I hope, I ask, I pray that before taking to the internet, take a beat, take a breath, and resist the urge to pile on heedlessly. Listen. Seek. Learn. Lend a hand as best you can.

How do you listen to notes.- We're as close to a shooting war with Russia that we've been since the Cuban missile crisis. If the Russians hit Turkey hard, we'll either need to stand up to our NATO obligations and defend them or let them get run over. Given Obama, the latter will likely apply, and that sets a nasty precedent both in terms of how we treat our NATO allies and how we react to Russia. Our enemies will now fear us less and our allies fear us more.
- Race relations are at their worst since the late 1960's. Police are being challenged and, in some instances, flat out murdered. The cops are not blameless, and as we've seen in video in Chicago, murderers are in their ranks as well.
- ISIS runs rampant and has extended their sphere of terror, murder, and rape across continents. Our nation's response has been to demand that we accept refugees, deride those that want that policy vetted, and focus on "climate change" as the most compelling subject to be addressed.
- Planned Parenthood is caught red-handed selling baby body parts, but a dutiful media and Democrat party sweeps their mess under the rug. When a clearly mentally ill shoots up a clinic, they're now the spotless victims.

Virginia, United StatesIs the art world too sensitive to see itself in the corrosively shiny veneer of reality television? To hear artists and art critics kvetch on blogs, in the arts press and at art openings, it appears Bravo‚Äôs new series, "Work of Art: America‚Äôs Next Great Artist," is ruffling feathers.
"Just watched 1st epi of bravo's 'work of art.' truly terrible," wrote an artist friend in her Facebook post. "What's with all the painters? and since when did 'i can't sell this' become a valid critique?" Jenn Graves, art critic for Seattle‚Äôs Stranger, emphatically concurred: "The show was horrible. Really, truly awful. Critic Jerry Saltz was the biggest disappointment for me: Is it the editing, or does he really believe that the mission statement of art is, 'Art is a way of showing the outside world what your inside world is like.' So is vomiting." "The overall quality of artist-crew is at best uneven," writes Regina Hackett in ArtsJournal. Even one of the show's judges, the aforementioned Jerry Saltz, noted his ambivalence in a New York magazine blog posting: "Art on TV and in movies always comes off creepy."
Contemporary art has never quite jibed with mainstream media. Art, it seems, gets close to the mainstream only when it combines big money and pop iconography ‚Äî Damien Hirst, Banksy, Jeff Koons, or the perennial Andy Warhol, who famously cameo-ed on "The Love Boat." But the show has somehow recruited major auction house kingpin Simon de Pury as the mentor figure, and persuaded the venerable Brooklyn Museum to host a solo show of the winning artist (a longtime museum trustee resigned in protest against the Bravo partnership). Both are participating in the show despite the risk of being called "sellouts," one of the art world's biggest insults.
Part of the reason art so rarely flourishes on TV is that most artists are reluctant to be represented in the mainstream media. Just hearing people on television discuss "the work" in art-world lingo, makes us art-world denizens shudder: In the context of highly formatted cable entertainment, it sounds put on and pretentious. The judges on "Work of Art," for example, look for art that makes them "feel" ("Your art didn‚Äôt make us feel anything‚Äù being one of host China Chow‚Äôs steely dismissal lines), and then there are the clownish, obviously expensive designer clothes they wear to their so-called crits. It's enough to make you wonder why artists would want to participate (the casting calls attracted hundreds of hopefuls).
Nao Bustamante, a contestant who works primarily in performance and is in the first episode relegated to the egotistical villain role, admitted in a recent interview that her participation came with artistic intent. "I went on as a narrative experiment," she told me, meaning to upset the standard narrative of an artist‚Äôs career. One thing you don‚Äôt learn on the show is that an art career currently adheres to a chronology: first an MFA, then gallery representation, a string of exhibitions (and maybe sales), a teaching job, a museum retrospective and death (which increases the value of the artwork).
"I wanted to shake up that model, make it uncomfortable," Bustamante said. It‚Äôs an artistically honorable sentiment, though it‚Äôs fairly clear that her attempts at challenging the system didn't always survive the harsh editing of reality TV. (True to form, "Work of Art" includes archetypal characters familiar to anyone who frequents gallery openings ‚Äî though "curated" for catty drama potential, leaving out the eggheads and socially awkward artists.)
"Work of Art" attempts to offer an intimate view of the place where artistic creation happens, but it doesn't quite pull that off, in part because it sticks faithfully to the reality TV structure. Like other shows in the genre, the producers make contestants jump through hoops, in accelerated time frames, to make stuff ‚Äî a format that has very little to do with real-world creative activities. Artists are as likely to make a portrait in nine hours as a chef combining Cheetos and balsamic is likely to make a great meal. In episode 3, the contestants created book covers, a challenge that ignores the distinctions between fine and commercial art. It's no wonder the results weren't very good.
That said, the show does seem to be getting better,?
To cross over into pop culture, we need art icons who can flourish in public, the way Marina Abramovic ‚Äî an artist whose power and charisma courts and can withstand the glare of the media lights ‚Äî did with her MOMA retrospective. Is it any wonder that Jeff Koons, whose work is all about pop sentiment, was the only artist to be mentioned by name ‚Äî twice ‚Äî in the premiere? "Work of Art‚Äôs" $100,000 prize wouldn‚Äôt even qualify as a down payment on one of his million-dollar sculptures, but it is a modest price to pay to put working artists, semi-realistically, on the cultural radar. For that, I plan to keep watching.

The 7-11 you see in 1993 closed in 2005 (or 2006, GM can‚Äôt remember exactly). Absolutely nothing has happened to this property since then. Is it a bad location? Is it a stubborn landlord? How can a space like this sit empty in Georgetown for over five years? Something‚Äôs wrong here.

I believe that good nonprofit operations can change the world. Every process, every policy, every purchase is a chance to create positive change. I aim to ensure that every aspect of the Meyer Foundation‚Äôs operations serves our mission and values.
As the Operations Director for the Foundation, I wear a variety of hats. In essence, I‚Äôm the person staff can turn to when they have questions or need help getting things done! I ensure that our technology, facilities, administrative practices, and human resource functions are operating smoothly. I also manage internal projects aimed at continuously improving our infrastructure and operations. No two workdays are the same. You might find me at a white board drafting project plans or under a desk setting up a new computer. I make sure we have what we need to do our best work.
Prior to joining the Foundation, I was an activist and organizer, focused mainly on public health and inequity based on gender, race, sexuality, and class. My background is in sociology; I‚Äôm interested in understanding and dismantling the systems used to oppress the many for the benefit of the few. When Meyer took on racial equity as a priority, it felt like coming home. Being at Meyer, transitioning into the role of operations, and discovering project management as a talent have given me the opportunity and tools to combine what I‚Äôm good at (getting stuff done), with my passion (equity).
I joined the Foundation in 2010.Description

A state on fire
California is burning ‚Äì now more than ever before. Each year millions of acres of land are reduced to ashes, tens of thousands of buildings razed and countless lives put under threat. As the climate crisis fuels another destructive wildfire season, Louise Boyle meets the crews that are preparing to face disaster head-on
Firefighters struggle to contain flames in Santa Paula, California
In sizzling heat on the outskirts of San Diego, the new recruits to California‚Äôs largest firefighting agency are learning a sombre but essential skill: what to do if they find themselves surrounded by flames with no way out.
Crews can have just seconds to deploy fire shelters ‚Äì resembling oversized, silver sleeping bags ‚Äì then lie down and cover themselves before burying their faces into the earth. For about a minute, these shelters can shield them from a blaze reaching more than 1,000C.
‚ÄúIt‚Äôs the last line of defence if you‚Äôre impinged by fire and cannot get to a safety zone,‚Äù Captain Frank LoCoco tells The Independent. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs the final option if you cannot get out.‚Äù
With each passing year, California‚Äôs firefighters face an onslaught of ever more extreme wildfires ‚Äì and this last resort is becoming increasingly necessary. Last September, 14 firefighters deployed their shelters after being overtaken by flames on Big Sur during the North Complex fire that burned more than 300,000 acres and killed 16 people. The firefighters suffered burns and smoke inhalation, with some needing hospital treatment, but all survived.

President Biden has acknowledged that more resources must be made available to give support those on the wildfire frontline. Pledging to ‚Äúact now and act fast‚Äù, he has committed to hiring more federal firefighters ‚Äî and immediately raised their pay ‚Äî and reiterated the importance of a year-round workforce to combat the growing threat.‚Äú
Because of climate change, wildland firefighting is no longer a seasonal endeavour,‚Äù the White House said in a statement. ‚ÄúWith fire seasons turning into fire years, it is imperative to have a year-round workforce that is available to respond at any time, that is supported and equitably compensated and is available to undertake preventive actions.‚Äù
In 2020, California, Oregon and Colorado saw fires on a level never seen before, and the pace of the spread is now even worse. California had its first recorded ‚Äúgigafire‚Äù ‚Äì the August Complex ‚Äì which burned through 1 million acres along the Pacific coastline. Overall, 4.3 million acres and 10,000 buildings in California were destroyed, killing 33 ‚Äì including four firefighters. The National Weather Service issued what‚Äôs believed to have been the first ever warning for ‚Äúfire tornados‚Äù ‚Äì a phenomenon caused by intense heat from flames pushing hot air upwards ‚Äì for an area near Loyalton, northeastern California.
Funded by our Supporter Programme, The Independent travelled the length of California as the state braced for even more destruction, speaking to those whose lives have been ruined by wildfires ‚Äì and the people preparing to face this inevitable disaster head-on.
‚ÄòWe haven‚Äôt had half the rain we‚Äôre supposed to get‚Äô
California has always burned. But, since 1970, the scale of destruction has hugely accelerated. The amount of land covered by the fires has increased fivefold, while wildfire season itself is lasting longer too, stretching on for at least two additional months.
The larger, more intense fires are being fuelled by extreme heat and drought. These conditions are linked to the climate crisis, caused largely by greenhouse gas emissions from decades of burning fossil fuels.
In California, average temperatures have risen around 1C in the past century. Since records began in the 1880s, the hottest years have been the past seven ‚Äì 2020 was highest, joint with 2016.
This month, before summer even began, a ‚Äúheat dome‚Äù formed over the desert in the southwest, sending temperatures to around 100F (37.8C). Fifty million Americans were placed under a dangerous heat warning, and temperature records were broken across states.

At the same time, California‚Äôs rainfall has become less frequent in autumn and spring, while winter storms have become more volatile. California is historically prone to long periods of drought, but these are expected to increase with global heating and less reliable rainfall. As the state heats up further, moisture evaporates from the vegetation and the soil, leaving it primed for burning.
The Sierra Nevada snowpack, which supplies California with water via a network of aqueducts, has become smaller with each decade. In 2021, the snowpack melted two months earlier than expected. A ‚Äúmegadrought‚Äù has reached its worst point in 20 years and is expected to persist through September, leaving California‚Äôs reservoirs 50 per cent lower than usual and states of emergency in 41 of 58 counties.

One stress point is Lake Oroville in northern California. The lake is currently at about 37 per cent capacity, a worryingly low level for a water resource that helps irrigate 25 per cent of all US crops and powers major hydroelectric plants.
Tony Davis, manager at Lake Oroville‚Äôs marina, which saw boats being removed by the dozen last month, calls the impact of the climate crisis ‚Äúpretty undeniable‚Äù.

‚ÄúWe haven‚Äôt had half the rain we‚Äôre supposed to get, and half the snowpack. It makes it really hard when we don‚Äôt have water,‚Äù he tells The Independent.
On top of the drought, add to the mix the Santa Ana winds in southern California ‚Äì dry, powerful gusts which can reach up to 70mph in autumn when the fire risk is highest, dancing embers across treetops and fanning flames down mountainsides. In the north, the Diablo winds create similarly dangerous conditions.
To really understand what has driven California‚Äôs mammoth wildfires requires a look backwards. Indigenous people across the world, including tribes in California, have for millennia used deliberate, controlled fires to regenerate land, prevent overgrowth, and support the lifecycles of species.
But for more than 100 years, the US government instead followed a path of fire suppression to protect timber supplies and communities. Federal policy ignored the vital ecological role that ‚Äúgood‚Äù fire has played in North American forests for thousands of years. And so the forest floors became carpeted with vegetation, waiting for a spark.
‚ÄòIt‚Äôs too traumatising, every time the wind blows‚Äô
All but three of California‚Äôs 20 largest recorded fires have occurred in the last 20 years. Six took place in 2020. The deadliest of them all was Camp Fire in 2018, which killed 85 people and destroyed 95 per cent of the town of Paradise in northern California.
‚ÄúMy wife and I became separated, we lost cell phone communication early on. We sat in gridlocked traffic with flames on either side for four or five hours,‚Äù Woody Culleton, whose family barely escaped, tells The Independent.
‚ÄúThe whole town was catching on fire. At 9am, it was like midnight because the smoke was so black. Embers were blowing across [the road]. It was just frightening.

‚ÄúInitially we were in shock. We lost our home and our stuff. But it‚Äôs really about the people, routines and community. That‚Äôs the greatest thing that we lost. The fire made me realise how absolutely fragile life is.‚Äù
That wildfire was ignited by a utility provider, Pacific Gas and Electric, which had failed to maintain its faulty electrical grid despite the surrounding area being heavily forested and prone to high temperatures and strong winds. While the blame for starting that fire lies squarely with PG&E, the role of the climate crisis on its spread did not go unnoticed.
‚ÄúFirefighters are living climate change, it‚Äôs staring them in the face every day,‚Äù Paradise firefighter John Singler said in Rebuilding Paradise, a documentary made following the disaster. He described the conditions in the run-up to Camp Fire as ‚Äúa perfect storm‚Äù.
Smoke plumes from the Camp Fire tower over homes in Paradise
Last year, signs of another monster fire sent panic through the town once more, and residents fled. The devastating Bear Fire did not reach the town, but struck about 40 miles away in the towns of Berry Creek and Feather Falls, killing three people.
The terror of wildfire leaves communities traumatised. Paradise has shrunk from a town of around 26,000 people to 6,000 ‚Äì in part because rebuilding efforts have been hampered by red tape, the pandemic, and expensive building supplies, but also because, for many, it has been impossible to return.
‚ÄúI know friends that have not been back to town since the day of the fire. It‚Äôs too traumatising, every time the wind blows. Many of us don‚Äôt sleep hardly at all any more,‚Äù Culleton says.
Prolonged wildfire seasons also bring health concerns. Fires create pollution in the form of tiny particles suspended in the air. These particles, no larger than one-third of the diameter of a hair follicle, can lodge deep in the lungs, causing asthma attacks, heart attacks and strokes, according to the American Lung Association. Studies of children in California found that those who breathed the smoky air during wildfires experienced more coughing, wheezing, bronchitis and colds. Doctors have warned that an hour exposed to wildfire smoke is equivalent to 60 minutes continuously smoking cigarettes.
Air pollution is not just a problem around the fires themselves: satellite data last year revealed that wildfire smoke from the West Coast had spread to eastern Canada, and went as far as the UK and other parts of northern Europe.

Then there is the environmental cost. The California wildfires in 2020 spewed more than 91 million metric tonnes of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere, the Global Fire Emissions Database reported. That amounted to about 25 per cent more than California‚Äôs annual emissions from fossil fuels.
This year looks set to see another prolonged fire season. Up to this week, 3,539 fires have been reported in California, compared with 2,875 last year over the same period. The number of acres burned has jumped 58 per cent year on year.
As more fires ignite and the demand for firefighters increases, the US National Interagency Fire Centre last week raised the national preparedness to level four on its scale, on which the maximum is five. It‚Äôs the fourth time in the last 20 years that it has hit that level in June. Around 9,000 firefighters are already on the ground, battling blazes.
‚ÄòPlaying by a whole new set of rules‚Äô
‚ÄúIt‚Äôs a new paradigm,‚Äù says Captain Eric Just, from Cal Fire‚Äôs forestry unit in San Diego. ‚ÄúThere are signs of another really challenging fire season and everyone right now is training up, getting ready.‚Äù
San Diego is employing a further 300 people at the ‚ÄúFirefighter 1‚Äù level of proficiency ‚Äì a seasonal role that typically starts in late spring and lasts for as long as the major wildfires do. The US fights wildfires using a network of state fire departments, such as Cal Fire, and local and federal agencies.
In training, a stack of shipping containers is used to recreate the conditions of a burning building. Using the carcass of a school bus, recruits learn how to perform extrication with power tools. Fire crews must also be skilled in how to handle, clamp and extend an engine hose line at speed, pull colleagues and themselves through tight, awkward spaces, and perform emergency medical interventions.
‚ÄúIt‚Äôs continuous education and training to stay sharp. Adaptation is paramount,‚Äù says Captain LoCoco.
Firefighters training in San Diego use shipping containers to mimic burning buildings
In March, California governor Gavin Newsom announced emergency authorisation of $81m for an additional 1,400 firefighters in the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection (the state agency Cal Fire‚Äôs official title) to ramp up its wildfire response.
California is expected to have the largest firefighting force ever, heading into peak fire season. ‚ÄúWe aren‚Äôt just waiting for the next crisis to hit ‚Äì this funding will support our heroic firefighters to save lives as they work to prevent and tackle destructive wildfires,‚Äù the governor said.
The state is also racing against the clock to cull heavy ‚Äúfuel loads‚Äù, firefighter lingo for the dried-out vegetation across the state.
In the past 30 years, millions of Californians have moved further out of developed areas into what‚Äôs known as the wildland urban interface (WUI) zone, due to the dwindling housing and exorbitant property prices spurred by the Silicon Valley tech boom. The WUI (pronounced ‚Äúwoo-ee‚Äù) is land where homes butt up against forests and grassland, making them more susceptible to fire.

in 1964, when the Hanly Fire struck Sonoma County, at the heart of California wine country, it destroyed about 100 homes. The 2017 Tubbs Fire blazed across nearly the same footprint in a fraction of the time, razing 5,636 structures and killing 22 people.
While Governor Newsom has also called for an unheard-of $2bn for wildfire preparedness, on the ground crews are already hard at work.
Captain Just‚Äôs unit maintains around 25 ‚Äúfuel breaks‚Äù ‚Äì continuous gaps in vegetation to ideally prevent fire or, at least, slow it down. Cal Fire works closely with Fire Safe Councils (FSCs), a network of about 140 community-led groups that minimise threats in neighbourhoods using techniques such as fuel breaks.
Steve Kerrin is president of Deer Springs FSC, which undertakes projects over a 47 sq m area in San Diego‚Äôs inland North County. It includes the community of Hidden Meadows, a neighbourhood of about 1,800 properties dotted across canyons on the WUI. Three years ago, the council received a state fire prevention grant to clear a five-mile fuel break below people‚Äôs homes.
‚ÄúIn addition to protecting the immediate residents, this could also be a path for a fire to progress into [the cities of] Escondido, San Marcos and Vista,‚Äù Mr Kerrin says.
‚ÄúFires seem to be playing by a whole new set of rules now.‚Äù
Fuel breaks can make a big difference. During the 2017 Creek Fire near Los Angeles, only five out of 1,400 homes within the fire perimeter burned, thanks to a well-placed fuel break, according to ecologists.
California and the US Forest Service have agreed to ramp up the treatment of forests and woodlands to 1 million acres by 2025, but still have a long way to go to reach this goal.
While mitigation is a perennial process, California also has to tackle blazes head-on. Cal Fire already has the largest firefighting air force in the world, with about 60 planes, air tankers and helicopters spread across dozens of bases, but additional aircraft are expected in the next few years.

Battalion chief Nick Brown oversees the aviation program from a base in Ramona. He says that, while the aviation fleet‚Äôs priority is to ‚Äúbox in the fire‚Äù when it covers 10 acres or less, he also acts as ‚Äúeyes in the sky‚Äù for crews on the ground.
‚ÄúDepending on the topography at ground level you might be unable to see past ridge lines, assess the fire‚Äôs acreage, or see if it‚Äôs burning heavier on one flank or the other,‚Äù Captain LoCoco explains. ‚Äú[Aviation crews] give us a pretty good painting from above and suggest augments to response, whether adding more engines and/or more aircraft. It‚Äôs a very integral position.‚Äù
Among the fleet are S-2T airtankers ‚Äì anti-submarine warfare planes from the navy that have been stripped of machine gun turrets, armour and ejection seats, then loaded with 1,200 gallons of fire retardant for tackling raging wildland fires.
The reddish-pink waves of retardant don‚Äôt extinguish wildfires, but they buy time for crews on the ground. Captain Nick Clement, who leads a helicopter crew at a base in El Cajon, recalls seeing trees burst into flames during missions in northern California last year.
‚ÄúI remember thinking how timber is not supposed to burn like that,‚Äù Captain Clements says. ‚ÄúIt wasn‚Äôt even a wind-driven fire. It was just fuel loads were so dry and there was so much of it.
‚ÄúFlying up and down the state, it‚Äôs all brown, and not in the desert [but] on the mountain ranges.‚Äù
‚ÄòEverybody has a trigger‚Äô
As the ferocity of wildfire season grows by the year, so too does the impact on the firefighters themselves. With the danger, the mental and physical toll increases as well, while longer seasons mean less and less time to recover.
‚ÄúEverybody‚Äôs got a breaking point,‚Äù notes Captain Clement.
Captain LoCoco adds: ‚ÄúWe all worked 45-day stretches last year while the state burned [and] have spent 48 hours straight on a fire waiting for resources. The biggest challenge for most is disengaging, especially during fire season. We‚Äôre always in work mode, and all have pride in what we do, but it‚Äôs hard. Your family has to be on board with a job like this.‚Äù
He says that the fire service has vastly improved its mental health support in the last few decades, with counsellors ‚Äúa phone call away‚Äù. Following traumatic events, reviews and debriefs are commonplace.
‚ÄúWe see hundreds of times more death and destruction than the average person, and you still have to go to the next call,‚Äù he says. ‚ÄúEverybody has a trigger. For me, and for anybody I know, it‚Äôs any child-related fatality. At the same time, you still have a job to do.‚Äù
If last year‚Äôs mammoth blazes laid bare how stretched firefighting ranks had become, they also revealed how dismally some firefighters were being compensated for work that is increasingly perilous, more physically demanding, and lasts for many more weeks.
President Joe Biden last week expressed shock at the $13 hourly wage paid to many federal firefighters, calling it a ‚Äúridiculously low salary‚Äù and promising to rectify it while he is in office.
A car burning outside Vacaville, California, during the Lightning Complex fire
Officials at the National Interagency Fire Centre recently said they face a potential shortage of firefighters in 2021 because the starting salary doesn‚Äôt cut it.
While the 2020 California wildfire season was compounded by the constraints and anxiety of rising Covid-19 rates, it also meant a decline in prison inmate firefighters, as outbreaks disrupted training programmes that the state had relied on for decades as a primary line of defence.
These firefighters are typically ‚Äúhand crews‚Äù doing precarious work with chainsaws and tools to establish crucial firelines around communities. They are also integral to the gruelling clean-up operation once a fire has been extinguished.
Cal Fire director Thom Porter said in April that he was concerned about the wildfire readiness of the agency. The number of prison crews available has dropped from 190 to fewer than 70. ‚ÄúThe operational concerns that I have are really in boots on the ground,‚Äù he said.
At one point last September, more than 30,000 firefighters were on the ground in western states. But so many blazes were burning at the same time, agencies scrambled to shift resources from place to place and weren‚Äôt always able to send help where it was needed.
Crews were drafted in from around the US, while countries including Mexico, Israel and Australia sent firefighters to help.
Those in specialised positions, such as aviation crews, are in particularly high demand during peak season.
‚ÄúThe firefighters just kept going and going,‚Äù Captain Clements says. ‚Äú[I was] passing people at Sacramento airport and finding out what fires they were going to.
‚ÄúAs soon as one fire [is over], it‚Äôs on to the next one.‚ÄùRaccoons may look adorable with their mask-like faces and cute little paws, and when they‚Äôre outside, they‚Äôre fun to watch. It‚Äôs when they come into your home that it becomes a problem.
Raccoons are nocturnal mammals that are known for eating just about anything. They‚Äôre omnivores, and in the wild, they‚Äôll eat crawfish, frogs and anything else they can catch in a river as well as plants, fruits and eggs stolen from other nests. Around your neighborhood, you‚Äôve likely seen raccoons poking around trash cans, trying to find their next meal from your scraps.
Raccoons can live just about anywhere. You‚Äôll find them in forests in the northern United States, but surprisingly, you can also find them in tropical areas like Costa Rica. In a way, raccoons are somewhat similar to bears. They like to gorge themselves in the summer and fall months and then spend the winter months asleep in their dens.
You can usually find raccoon dens in the hollow of a tree or log or any secure burrow. They need warmth and protection to survive the winter. In cities, you might even find them in storm drains and other little burrows. You may also find them in the attic of your home.
Female raccoons will usually give birth in the early summer months. Usually one to seven cubs may be born at once. The cubs will stay with their mother for the first two months and then start coming out with their mother. They will start exploring the outside on their own and eventually leave the den completely and go make their own homes.
In general, raccoons are just like any other living creature. They‚Äôre just trying to live, and really most raccoons only live for about three years. But when raccoons get inside your home, they can cause big problems.
5 signs of a raccoon infestation
As mentioned, raccoons look to make their dens in warm places where they can last through the winter. They spend those cold months usually sleeping, so it can be difficult to know whether you‚Äôve got a raccoon infestation until spring. As you‚Äôll note from previous blogs, female wasps can lay dormant all winter in your attic and then wake up and start a colony in the spring. If you don‚Äôt go up to your attic frequently, then you might not notice an infestation before it‚Äôs too late.
If you think you may have a raccoon infestation, here are five signs to look out for:
1. The ongoing smell of feces or urine
When raccoons build a den in your attic, they usually won‚Äôt go in or out of it very much in the winter. They will eat as much as they can in the late summer and fall and then snooze through most of the winter. That means they‚Äôll do all their, er, business in their new den ‚Äî your attic.
Overtime, you will start to smell the urine and feces building up in your attic. You will probably smell it in the upper floors of your home and definitely in areas underneath your attic.
2. Outside damage to your home
Sometimes you can spot an infestation before it really takes hold. You can spot signs of raccoons hanging out around your home, and by doing this, you can try to prevent raccoons from getting inside.
If you think a raccoon is trying to get into your home, you might notice damage to the gutters, shutters, shingles and vents around the outside. This could mean that a raccoon is scouting out your attic and looking for an easy way to get in. Remember, raccoons can catch fish, and they‚Äôre very quick and good with their paws. If they find a weak spot near your roof, they might try to exploit it and work their way in.
3. Scratches and scurrying noises at night in your home
Raccoons are most active at night, so you probably won‚Äôt hear them moving around much during the day. But at night, it can usually be hard not to hear a raccoon moving around.
You can easily hear them scratching around the attic and sometimes even in the walls if they can get access to them. Though raccoons are pretty small, you might even hear them walking around your attic. If the raccoons are able to get into your home, then you will probably see scratches in odd places.
4. Tree branches connecting to your home
You might be thinking, ‚ÄúHow could a racoon even get up to my roof? I don‚Äôt have a patio or an easy way for them to get into my attic.‚Äù But the fact is, you probably do have an easy way to get up to your roof ‚Äî just not for you.
Raccoon love to climb, and they‚Äôre good at it. They‚Äôre small enough and agile, so if you have just a few tree branches dangling over your roof, that will be enough to help them get from the tree to your roof.
5. Pets acting oddly
Sometimes our pets know things long before we do. Dogs, of course, have much better hearing than we do, and some cats are natural-born hunters looking for their next prey.
If you notice your pet acting oddly, it might be because your cat or dog heard a raccoon or even smelled it. Your pet might stare up at the ceiling in a bedroom or pace near a spot where they might hear a raccoon scurrying around in the wall. Your pet might whine or you might have a hard time getting them to leave the room. If you notice these issues with your pet, they might know something that you don‚Äôt.
Raccoon infestations can look a little like rat infestations. If you‚Äôre not sure what could be living in your home, make sure you contact a green pest control expert sooner rather than later.
When you have a raccoon infestation, contact a pest control company that performs the raccoon removal Edmond relies on.Department of Mechanical Engineering

:
1. Do not attempt 'do it yourself' solutions. If you are concerned about an heir contesting your estate plan, the last thing you want to do is attempt to write or update your will or trust on your own..
3. Use discretionary trusts for problem beneficiaries. You may feel that you have to completely disinherit a beneficiary because of concerns that a potential beneficiary will squander their inheritance or use it in a manner that is against your beliefs. However, there are other options than completely disinheriting someone. For example, you can require that the problem beneficiary's share be held in a lifetime discretionary trust and name a third party, you have taken the time to review and revise your plan as your family and financial situations change. This, in turn, will discourage challenges since your plan will encompass your current estate planning goals.
By following these four tips, your heirs will be less likely to challenge your estate planning decisions and will be more inclined to fulfill your final wishes. If you are concerned about heirs contesting your will or trust, you should seek the professional adviceCANape 15.0 SP5
Updates existing installations of version 15.0 to 15.0.50 SP5. The following changes become effective with version 15.0.50:
User Operation and Display

Kanye West Sunday Service Choir Drops 'Jesus is Born'
12/25/2019 12:18 PM PT12/25/2019 12:18 PM PT
The wait is over ... Kanye West and his Sunday Service choir have finally dropped its "Jesus is Born" gospel album.
Kanye had everyone waiting with anticipation since he teased the album in an interview back in October. The 19-track album hit all major digital streaming platforms today ... just in time for Christmas. Instead of going with a major label to release his album, Ye chose a New Jersey-based Indie distributor, Vydia.
Some of the track titles include "Count Your Blessings," "That's How the Good Lord Works" and "Satan, We're Gonna Tear Your Kingdom Down." Kanye, of course, dropped his "Jesus is King" album back in October after many delays. That album featured 11 tracks.
Yeezy had a massive album listening event at The Forum in L.A. when that album dropped. Fans were also treated to a screening of his "Jesus is King" IMAX project.
Kanye and his choir most recently hit up the Lincoln Center and performed "Mary." As we reported ... the stage was decked out in plants, over 100 choir members and props to tell the story of Jesus' birth from the eyes of his mother. There was also a rendition of "The Little Drummer Boy.".

Recent CommentsKinemortophobia ‚Äî (from the Greek kine, meaning ‚Äúmotion,‚Äù and morto, meaning ‚Äúdead‚Äù): is the fear of zombies. Most commonly caused by watching films where zombies are portrayed. It is a common phobia.
And with that bit of distracting foreshadowing aside, a hearty HAPPY NEW YEAR to regular readers, irregular readers (see a doctor), random readers and fellow survivors. We‚Äôve managed to persevere! And make it through one of the worst years in recent recorded human history.
But have no delusions my friends in the ball dropping on 2020 as being nothing more than a faux finish-line. The only thing that‚Äôs going to change is the last 2 digits when you write the date. Other than that it‚Äôs the same s***, different year.
So we can keep casting a backwards thumb, laying blame on an intangible time span (poor 2020). Or we can pointy-finger ahead to improving the future. We can‚Äôt exactly change the world but we can resolve to better ourselves, in turn making it a better place. How you may ask? Why, by making New Year‚Äôs resolutions, of course!
Oh but Mr. Chainsaw, lying to ourselves‚Ä¶ err, keeping resolutions is hard. And we just came through a bad year (stop thumbing). We just can‚Äôt take any more disappointing failures.
Point taken and finger pointed. To boost your moral, what follows is a list of resolutions you can‚Äôt help but keep. Hopefully you will find some confidence and humor for this year with‚Ä¶
CHAINSAW‚ÄôS 21 EASY TO
RESOLVE RESOLUTIONS
1. Resolve to breathe. Look you‚Äôre doing it right now! It‚Äôs almost involuntary‚Ä¶well actually, it is. Still this is one resolution you can‚Äôt help but keep‚Ä¶unless you are dead. In which case, thank you for your continued patronage in the afterlife.
2. Resolve to work out. Didn‚Äôt say what you were going to ‚Äúwork out‚Äù but surely by year‚Äôs end you‚Äôll have worked something out.
3. Resolve to finish this sentence. See that was easy!
4. Resolve to learn to read and read more. Well, look at you, getting the jump on that one ‚Äî reading already. And now you‚Äôve read 17 more words than you had when you resolved to do so! That makes 30 so ‚Äî Keep up the good work!
5. Resolve to change something in your life! You can start with your underwear and socks and go from there.
6. Resolve to buy something brand new. You can easily accomplish this next time you go to the grocery. Unless you‚Äôre eating recycled foods‚Ä¶think about that ((shudders)).
7. Resolve to give someone a random compliment, ‚ÄúMr. Chainsaw, what an entertaining article this week and so well written!‚Äù Done, and thank you!
8. Resolve to learn the phobia term for fear of the undead. And you nailed that one at the beginning of the article.
9. Resolve not to learn a foreign language. Just think positive that you won‚Äôt learn a second language. Before you know it, you won‚Äôt have.
10. Resolve to finish reading this article. C‚Äômon you can do it, you‚Äôre already halfway there. Not to mention the fact that you have the rest of the year to complete it. That‚Äôs like less than a word a day!
11. Resolve not to become a victim of an attempted political assassination.
12. Resolve to not start wild fires. Keep them calm with candy or snacks. Only you‚Ä¶
13. Resolve not to take candy from strangers‚Ä¶unless there‚Äôs a fire. Only you and a stranger‚Ä¶
14. Resolve to have better patients. Not a typo, this one applies to medical personages because patients getting better is your job.
15. Resolve to not be abducted by aliens.
16. Resolve that if you are abducted, to steal some cool s*** from their ship.
17. Resolve to only make necessary mistakes.
18. Resolve to look at least one way when crossing a one-way street. Straight ahead is a way.
19. Resolve not to endanger any species‚Ä¶unless they have it coming.
20. Resolve to use the bathroom. No need to actually live your reputation.
21. Resolve to spend more time with yourself. Seriously, you‚Äôre like right there with you. Grab a bite to eat or maybe just read this together.
Bonus resolution: As for myself ‚Äî I sincerely hope you resolve to tune in each week and see what I resolve to write‚Ä¶at least till the end of the year.
I welcome almost all questions, comments via FOCUS, or E-mail me at wanderingchainsaw@gmail.com.
Hope to hear from ya, until then try and stay focused! See ya.There‚Äôs a great song on the first Sonic Youth album called ‚ÄúShaking Hell.‚Äù The opening minute and a half ‚Äî steely, ominous, unsteadily motoric ‚Äî sounds like a piece of factory equipment malfunctioning in the moments before somebody loses a limb. Then, very suddenly, the machinery jams, the tempo slows to a crawl, and we hear the voice of the bass player, Kim Gordon, at once nervous and bracingly warriorlike: ‚ÄúShe‚Äôs finally discovered she‚Äôs a ‚Ä¶. He told her so!‚Äù
She‚Äôs a ‚Ä¶ what, exactly? One of the first times I heard the song I rewound that part a couple times, listening for the phantom noun. Once I came to better understand Kim Gordon, I realized that it wasn‚Äôt there. Gordon is a master of the beckoning omission, the blank space, the pregnant pause. (She‚Äôs said she picked up her ‚Äúidea of space, and in-between-ness, and the importance of phrasing‚Äù early, from her parents‚Äô jazz collection.) Her lines are cryptic but also legibly caustic ‚Äî a lot of Kim Gordon lyrics feel like inside jokes with Kim Gordon, jokes that are somehow very pointedly and personally and stingingly about you. Men feel at once enticed and threatened by this quality; they have called her things like ‚Äúsexy‚Äù and ‚Äúmysterious‚Äù and ‚Äúaloof.‚Äù Women, though, recognize the code that Gordon speaks as a survival strategy, a way to stay sane and maybe even be taken seriously in this weird world. Keep secrets with yourself, Gordon says with her silence. Do not fill in all the blanks, because the second you do, they‚Äôll think they‚Äôve got you figured out, they‚Äôll think you‚Äôre simple, they‚Äôll find a way to reduce you to what they can see. In her new memoir Girl in a Band, she sums up a lesson she learned shortly after Sonic Youth signed their major-label deal with Geffen in 1990: ‚Äú[F]or high-end music labels, the music matters, but a lot comes down to how the girl looks. The girl anchors the stage, sucks in the male gaze, and, depending on who she is, throws her own gaze back out into the audience.‚Äù That was always the most warriorlike thing about Kim Gordon: the gaze she throws back ‚Äî check the cover of the book ‚Äî is withering.
Over the course of Sonic Youth‚Äôs staggeringly consistent 30-year run, Gordon was a kind of fairy godmother of the underground. She and the band she started with her husband Thurston Moore made 15 albums, and in the meantime she got to know everybody worth knowing and more or less became the Leonard Zelig of the ‚Äô90s: There she is backstage giving Kurt parenting advice a little while after Nevermind broke; here she is casting an unknown, Marc Jacobs‚Äìfor‚ÄìPerry Ellis‚Äìclad Chlo√´ Sevigny in the video for ‚ÄúSugar Kane‚Äù; there she is accompanying a young, wide-eyed Sofia Coppola on a creatively formative trip to Tokyo. Between tours she painted; worked on the clothing line she co-founded, X Girl; and, with Moore, raised an inevitably cool daughter named Coco. Becoming a mom somehow made her more of a badass; decamping to idyllic Northhampton, Massachusetts, somehow made her more of a quintessential New Yorker. She ‚Äî they ‚Äî seemed like the exception to every rule. But that illusion shattered in October 2011, when Gordon and Moore announced they were splitting up after 27 years of marriage (and that Sonic Youth was breaking up, too). A generation who‚Äôd looked to them as a model for a creatively egalitarian, enduringly punk-rock marriage felt personally betrayed and, worse, as the details began to trickle out, they were all depressingly ordinary. ‚Äú[I]t ended in kind of a normal way,‚Äù Gordon said in a revealing Elle profile last year, ‚Äúmidlife crisis, starstruck woman.‚Äù
But this sudden focus on the more salacious details of her private life also violated some unspoken law of being Kim Gordon ‚Äî it filled in the spaces she‚Äôd so purposefully left blank. In a way, Girl in a Band is an attempt to retain the control of her own story; it somehow manages to be uncharacteristically candid and characteristically withholding. Still, brazenly, Gordon does not hide the fact that her wounds have not yet healed. ‚ÄúWriting about New York is hard,‚Äù one chapter begins, ‚Äú‚Ä¶ because knowing what I know now, it‚Äôs hard to write about a love story with a broken heart.‚Äù
Gordon grew up mostly in L.A. and came of age in the late ‚Äô60s, ‚Äútoo young to be a hippie but brushed by whatever rebellion and amped-up freedom there was in the air.‚Äù Her father was the first sociologist to research and name the archetypal cliques of American high schools; her mother was a seamstress who made beautiful caftans that Gordon was sometimes embarrassed to wear to her predominantly preppy school. Her older brother Keller is schizophrenic, though the general vibe of the late ‚Äô60s led to a late diagnosis; even after he started dressing all in white and carrying a Bible around, his behavior, as Gordon puts it, ‚Äúdidn‚Äôt seem all that extraordinary, as back then there were lots of eccentric bearded guys dressed in white roaming around L.A.‚Äù Gordon writes evocatively about California‚Äôs vastness and vacancy, and you can tell she still has some kind of bleak, Didion-esque nostalgia for the moment when the hippie dream began to unravel. (See also: Sonic Youth‚Äôs ‚ÄúDeath Valley ‚Äô69,‚Äù which, for my money, is a far better Charles Manson song than ‚ÄúHelter Skelter.‚Äù) Gordon transferred in and out of a couple of art schools, made friends with young upstarts like Mike Kelley, and then, one day, an event that could have been a catastrophe turned out to be a blessing: As she was turning out of a driveway, another car slammed into her VW Bug and pinned it against a wall. Gordon‚Äôs injuries healed quickly, but the $10,000 settlement check that came in the mail changed her life forever. She used it to move to New York.
Like any good New York story, Girl in a Band is an elegy for the year its teller arrived, which, in Gordon‚Äôs case, was 1980: ‚ÄúWhen did all of the Chock Full O‚Äô Nuts go,‚Äù she wonders, ‚Äúor the Blarney Stone bars with the corned beef and cabbage buffet-table lunch deals?‚Äù She works odd jobs ‚Äî graveyard-shift waitress, disorganized gallery assistant, copy-shop girl. Then one night at a show her friend introduced her to a tall, lanky kid from Connecticut with ‚Äúpillowy lips,‚Äù and he told her he liked her flip-up sunglasses. In 1981, they started the band. In 1987 ‚Äî just a few years before Neil Young asked them to open his arena tour because he thought their ‚ÄúExpressway to Yr Skull‚Äù was ‚Äúthe greatest guitar song ever written‚Äù ‚Äî they got married.
The middle section of Girl in a Band begins with a kind of disclaimer: ‚ÄúA lot has been written about Sonic Youth, so what follows are the songs, or the albums, or the times that I have the most to say about or remember the best.‚Äù
You can probably tell by the tone of that one sentence that this was not Kim Gordon‚Äôs favorite part of this book to write. It‚Äôs easy to want to blame this ‚Äî and everything, really ‚Äî on Moore; having to recall in vivid, literary detail the happier moments of a marriage cannot be fun in the wake of a messy, public divorce. With the exception of an evocative chapter about Murray Street and 9/11, the prose in this section becomes clipped and almost comically flat (on the birth of Coco in 1994: ‚ÄúYes, she changed our lives, and no one is more important to me. But the band played on.‚Äù), and in its least page-turning moments, Girl in a Band sometimes reads like a rote list of cool things Kim Gordon did with cool people, with too little in the way of analysis or depth. I don‚Äôt think this entirely because of the divorce, though. Anyone who‚Äôs ever interviewed Gordon knows she is constitutionally averse to talking about process and the reception of her work ‚Äî we shouldn‚Äôt have been expecting from her 50 pages on the legacy and impact of Daydream Nation. As she puts it, ‚ÄúSelf-consciousness [is] the beginning of creative death to me.‚Äù
I hate to say that the book is at its most riveting when it focuses on the breakup, but it‚Äôs true. The writing is so cuttingly detailed and elegantly scathing that I would almost believe that ‚ÄúElena Ferrante‚Äù is Kim Gordon‚Äôs secret pen name. (One can dream.) After Gordon discovered the text messages that revealed Moore was having an affair, and even after they had publicly announced their split, they finished up their last tour as Sonic Youth. Gordon re-creates the moments before their final show at a festival in S√£o Paulo with the perfect dash of emasculating venom: ‚ÄúThurston double-slapped our bass guitarist Mark Ibold on the shoulder and loped across the stage ‚Ä¶ I found that gesture so phony, so childish, such a fantasy. Thurston ‚Ä¶ has never been the shoulder-slapping type. It was a gesture that called out, I‚Äôm back. I‚Äôm free. I‚Äôm solo.‚Äù
You can watch the entire performance on YouTube, back-slap and all. Sure, there are two sides to every story, but after reading that passage it‚Äôs impossible not to see that small, haunting gesture through Gordon‚Äôs eyes.
I sometimes think Kim Gordon was the first Tumblr kid ‚Äî the aesthetic-minded hipster celebrating what she calls ‚Äúthe darkness shimmering beneath the shiny quilt of American pop culture.‚Äù She loved Madonna unabashedly and unironically; she wrote a mash note to the late Karen Carpenter in a magazine and later turned it into a beautiful post-punk song. Other times, though, Gordon‚Äôs anti-self-consciousness credo makes me glad she didn‚Äôt come up in the digital age ‚Äî that sense of distance and remove so crucial to her cool would have been harder to preserve. (And, anyway, one shudders to think of the ‚ÄúKool Thing‚Äù think pieces.)
But the glittering, electric, hot-pink power that Gordon wielded in Sonic Youth was something rare and completely of its moment. We get so stuck in our internet echo chambers now, only listening to the people who already share our ideologies and occasionally ganging up on those who don‚Äôt. Gordon, though, did something braver than just preach to the choir ‚Äî she fucked shit up from inside the machine. We are talking about a woman who slyly snuck Kathleen Hanna onto MTV, who signed a major-label deal only to write a song about a secretary who‚Äôd been sexually harassed at that very record label. Gordon‚Äôs feminism was the kind that made waves, scrambled frequencies, changed minds. And that‚Äôs probably because her perspective was never treated as niche ‚Äúwoman‚Äôs issue‚Äù but simply another personality within a complex and beloved band. Gordon‚Äôs songs about Karen Carpenter‚Äôs anorexia or sexist bosses were not relegated to the all-girl side project or the less-popular solo album ‚Äî they were the singles, the second songs on the band‚Äôs first two major-label albums. No other band of its time treated girliness as egalitarianly as Sonic Youth. Sure, the Pixies had a Kim, too, but they pushed her more and more to the margins with each album. Eventually they just replaced her with somebody else named Kim, as though she were a secretary herself, as though we wouldn‚Äôt know the difference.
On Monday night, Gordon spoke at BAM, in conversation with the film producer Margaret Bodde. My friend and I wondered how Kim Gordon was going to spend an hour and a half talking about herself, and the answer was that she didn‚Äôt. Instead, she showed a series of self-selected film clips ‚Äî Gimme Shelter, an early Stooges gig, Steven Stills at Big Sur fighting a heckler who‚Äôd insulted his fur coat ‚Äî the unifying thread of which Bodde described as ‚ÄúThings Going Wrong in a Rock Setting.‚Äù This motif delighted Gordon, clearly. She did chat a little bit about her recent gallery shows and her current band with Bill Nace, Body/Head, but mostly she just wanted to share some of her favorite movies with us. The T word was uttered once, when the Stills clip inspired her to reflect a little on the Neil Young tour, on which many things had gone wrong in a rock setting and her ex-husband had smashed a lot of guitars in frustration. She chuckled for a second, and then moved on. She survived. Maybe, in time, a cataclysmic breakup starts to look like an opportunity for a fresh start, another $10,000 car crash.
There‚Äôs a memorable passage in Girl in a Band about being a teenager in the ‚Äô60s and experiencing for the first time all those glorious clich√©s: French New Wave films, hallucinogens, books on eastern philosophy. ‚ÄúFrom that point on,‚Äù Gordon writes, ‚ÄúI would never feel sure, or comfortable, about making conclusions or bold, definite statements about anything. Questioning things fit in with ‚Äòbecoming,‚Äô which in turn brought me closer to living in the present and farther away from that idea that you‚Äôre done, ready formed, or cooked at some preset age like your early twenties.‚Äù Or your 30s, or your 60s, I want to add, though it would be too direct and obvious a thing for Gordon to say herself. She finally discovered she‚Äôs a ‚Ä¶ what, exactly? Bless Kim Gordon for still not giving us the word.Regular price

Council or municipality: City of Greater GeelongOn Kentucky Politics newsletter: Paul's positive sets off firestorm, Fischer's park problem
As Kentuckians continued to grapple with the global coronavirus pandemic this week, officials at the local, state and federal level worked to help constituents adjust and to remind them if they got off the track of best practices.
Fischer delivers parks ultimatum
Mayor Greg Fischer stressed that Louisville residents must adhere to federal health guidelines on social distancing even when enjoying the outdoors ‚Äî or else.
That's because on the first weekend of spring in parts of Louisville, many people seemed to act as if there wasn't a pandemic. Pictures and reports showed dozens of visitors at city parks and other recreational spots playing pickup basketball, soccer and Frisbee.
Just plain unacceptable, the mayor said.
The city's message started off with polite new signage at public parks across Louisville, warning residents not to use playgrounds or play sports. But the Fischer administration is escalating the effort by detaching the basketball rims, The Courier Journal discovered Thursday.
If this keeps up?
"Everything is on the table," Fischer said.
[This is an online version of the newsletter. Sign up here to receive On Kentucky Politics in your inbox.]
Rand Paul tests positive
Sen. Rand Paul, R-Ky., was one of those people accused of not using best practices in the face of the pandemic this week.
Paul, who attended the Speed Ball at the Speed Museum in Louisville on March 7, where the coronavirus sickened multiple people, at first said he wouldn't get tested for the virus, but later did. While waiting for the test results, Paul continued with his daily routine in the U.S. Senate, though, rather than self-isolating before receiving the result ‚Äî which turned out to be positive.
The editorial board of The Courier Journal weighed in on Paul's decision, as did columnist Joe Gerth, who had this to say: "The fact that Paul was, as always, looking out for No. 1 has exposed other members of the Senate, their families and staffs to this dreaded virus. He should be ashamed."
America's Mayor is in Kentucky
"Listen up dipsh*ts and sensible people," has become an international call thanks to Gabe Brown, the potty-mouthed mayor of Walton, Kentucky.
Unlike other Kentucky leaders ‚Äî namely Gov. Andy Beshear ‚Äî who are expressing concern through warmth and patient understanding, Brown spoke to how a lot of people feel about those who refuse to comply with health guidelines.
Brown told The Courier Journal he posted his rant to Facebook after he received word earlier that afternoon that the first positive coronavirus case had just been found in Boone County .
After ‚Äúa little while of some people getting chippy with me and me getting chippy back,‚Äù he said, ‚ÄúI had kind of just had enough.‚Äù
The result has been a good kind of viral ‚Äî the one where Brown gained global notoriety for his tell-it-like-it-is approach.
McConnell delivers on $2T aid package
Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell was able to get a huge bill across the finish line aimed at helping the country deal with the crisis.
Despite Democratic setbacks, the Kentucky Republican was able to get bipartisan buy-in with a vote of 96-0.
If approved, the measure will given U.S. adults a lump-sum check of up to $1,200 ($2,400 for joint tax returns), and those with little or no tax liability would get at least $600 ($1,200 for joint returns). Families would receive an additional $500 for each qualifying child.
This plan also includes $10 billion in emergency grants of up to $10,000 to provide immediate relief for small-business operating costs.
The Democratic-controlled House is scheduled to take up this emergency aid proposal Friday but McConnell is already taking a victory lap after taking a serious hit for leaving Washington for an event with Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh in Kentucky amid the initial negotiations earlier this month.
Another Kentuckian, though ‚Äî Rep. Thomas Massie ‚Äî isn't so sure about McConnell's efforts. He said Thursday he's thinking of voting 'no' or working to slow down the $2 trillion package because of national deficit concerns.
Speaking of Mitch
McConnell didn't want to say a word when asked what he thought of President Donald Trump using the term "China virus" or "Chinese virus" in remarks about COVID-19.
"Our country is in the midst of a health and economic challenge," McConnell spokeswoman Stephanie Penn told The Courier Journal. "...This isn‚Äôt the time for petty squabbling, but for every American to come together to do their part."
That is strange because McConnell has had no problem denouncing anti-Asian comments in the past ‚Äî especially when those comments were aimed at his wife, Elaine Chao, who serves as Trump's transportation secretary.
Legislature keeps meeting
As social distancing has become the norm across Kentucky, and businesses are closing or moving to remote work, there's a pretty important group that continues to assemble in large numbers.
The Kentucky General Assembly.
Gov. Andy Beshear, a Democrat, has called out the Republican-controlled legislature for scheduling votes on bills unrelated to the state budget or the coronavirus challenge, as reporter Joe Sonka points out.
But speaking with The New York Times this week, state Sen. Damon Thayer, of Georgetown, made it clear they aren't listening to the governor on this one.
‚ÄúPeople want to use the virus to shut us down and kill bills they don‚Äôt like," Thayer said.

The Scale-Invariant Vacuum (SIV) theory is based on Weyl's Integrable Geometry, endowed with a gauge scalar field. The main difference between MOND and the SIV theory is that the first considers a global dilatation invariance of space and time, where the scale factor $\lambda$ is a constant, while the second opens the likely possibility that $\lambda$ is a function of time. The key equations of the SIV framework are used here to study the relationship between the Newtonian gravitational‚Ä¶ Expand

In fact, according to a list released travel site Daily Travel Pill, Oxford is the highest ranking UK location.
The list titled ‚Äú50 most beautiful European villages & towns to visit in your lifetime‚Äù has high praise for the city in central southern England.
The message underneath Oxford reads: "When we think about Oxford, the first thing that comes first to mind is Oxford University. However, this English town has a lot more to offer.
"With world-class museums, great pubs, and stunning architecture, Oxford is the perfect destination for your holiday.
"Take a walking tour, go punting, and visit the Oxford Castle. There are tons of activities waiting for you in this fairy-tale town."
Oxford ranks 15th on the list of 50 destinations - My London looks at some of its amazing qualities.
Sightseeing
When you think about sightseeing in Oxford it is easy to immediately cast your mind to the world famous University of Oxford, which was established in c. 1096, making it 925 years ago.
However, that is just the tip of the iceberg when it comes to the amazing sights on offer in the city.
This include taking a day trip to Blenheim Palace, which is located just 8 miles outside of Oxford and from the amazing offers a look into the stunning Baroque architecture, and rooms that are untouched and still have original furniture in tact from a bygone era.
Other attractions include; the largest bookstore in Europe (Blackwell‚Äôs Books), Oxford Castle Prison, the Museum of Natural History and going punting. For those who are unfamiliar with the last activity on the list, punting is a quirky and unique-to-Oxford activity.
Punting is essentially pushing a boat around the rivers and canals of the university with a pole.
Places to eat
It is no wonder that Oxford is ranked as the standout location on the list, when you take into consideration its wide range of food offerings.
Covered Market is a 250-year-old historical market in Oxford with dozens of coffee bars, restaurants, traditional butchers, fish merchants, and independent shops.
There are a lot of homemade meals served here and it‚Äôs the best place to do some cheap shopping for groceries in the city. There are also lots of local vendors selling their handmade wares, including clothing, souvenirs, and jewellery..
Oxford has always prided itself on being a traditional British city, but in recent times it has began to step into the modern era and cater to those with a broader range of interests, namely cuisine.
A trip to Oxford will still see visitors being overwhelmed with options for a cold pint at one of its many pubs, but also a choice of delicacies from various corners of the globe at places like Colombia Coffee Roasters, The Coconut Tree Oxford, Hubble and Home and Spiced Roots.
No day out to Oxford could ever be complete without a full stomach!
Fun facts
Here are a few fun facts about Oxford for all of you trivia buffs out there:
- The University of Oxford is the Worlds Second Oldest University.
- The Name Oxford comes from the World Oxanforda, which means cattle crossing.
- During the Civil War from 1642 to 1646, Oxford was the Capital of England.
- During the World War II, England was never bombed because Hitler was intending to use Oxford as his Capital if he conquered England.
- Rowan Atkinson (Mr Bean) went to Oxford University.
- 27 British Prime Ministers were educated at Oxford University.
- The Oxford Motto is ‚ÄúFortis est veritas‚Äù which means ‚ÄúThe truth is strong‚Äù.
- The People of Oxford are known as Oxonian.
- Oxford was used as a filming location for Harry Potter and Actress Emma Watson (Hermione Granger in Harry Potter) went to school here.
How to get there
Outside of its vast history, one of the main appeals to Londoners will be the ease of access that Oxford offers to those travelling in from the capital..The National Consumer Commission (NCC) says that it has instituted an investigation into the activities of Ford Motor Company Southern Africa and its dealerships, for alleged prohibited conduct.
Speaking on the issue in the wake of the recent Ford Kuga 1.6 Eco Boost vehicle recall, NCC commissioner Ebrahim Mohamed says that his investigators yesterday served Ford Motor Company with an investigation certificate and letter, in this regard.
‚ÄúI can confirm that the NCC has instituted an investigation into the activities of Ford SA and its dealerships after receiving complaints alleging prohibited conduct. I further confirm that the NCC has duly notified Ford SA of this enforcement activity,‚Äù says commissioner Mohamed.
Mohamed says that the NCC received more than 130 complaints against Ford SA relating to various issues, including the combusting of Kuga vehicles, since December last year. He says.
‚ÄúWe have received Ford SA‚Äôs investigation report, and together with the allegations that have been made by consumers, decided to investigate the matter. We plead with affected consumers to allow us the necessary space and time to thoroughly deal with the matter,‚Äù added Mohamed.
‚ÄúA consumer rights violation is tantamount to a human rights violation. It is by no coincidence that the rights in the CPA are somewhat similar to those enshrined in the Bill of Rights of our Constitution,‚Äù concluded Mohamed.
NCC spokesperson Trevor Hattingh says once the investigation has been completed, the Commission will make a recommendation to the Consumer Tribunal. They can recommend that Ford pay an administrative levy not exceeding 10% of its annual turnover. Unless there is a settlement, the Tribunal will hold a hearing during which the Commission and Ford will both have an opportunity to state their case, whereafter the Tribunal will make a ruling.
Renisha Jimmy, sister of the late Reshall Jimmy who burnt to death in his Ford Kuga in December 2015, welcomed the investigation. She has been coordinating complaints by Kuga victims to the NCC. Renisha Jimmy expressed her full confidence in the NCC and said the decision to launch a full investigation corroborates everything the family and other victims have been saying about Ford. ‚ÄúThe fact that the Commission has decided to launch an investigation speaks for itself,‚Äù she said.
She further stressed that the family hopes that during the investigation special priority will be given to her brother‚Äôs matter.

Though the cap on the equity allocation is 15 per cent of the assets, the fund managers attempt to maintain the allocation within 80-100 per cent of the maximum equity exposure permitted. Within this low allocation, they further play it safe by diversifying. They ensure that they have exposure across all the sectors represented by the benchmark and mostly invest in the heavyweights, the result of which is a predominantly large-cap tilt. So while most of its peers are willing to go with a higher equity exposure and take bets in mid caps, this one plays it safe. When its assets rose over the past year, the number of stocks too increased simultaneously from 19 (January 2010) to 40 (February 2011).
On the debt side, quality is not compromised while the average maturity has fluctuated between 1.54 years and 4.06 years. Currently, it stands at 1.96 years. ‚ÄúThe debt of the portfolio consists of papers with 1-3 years maturity and the focus is on capital preservation and generation of regular income. We invest in papers rated at AA and above,‚Äù say the fund managers.
Though the fund has an exposure to G-Secs and floating rate bonds, it has a preference towards Non-Convertible-Debentures (NCDs). Since its launch, around half of its portfolio has been in NCDs which now stand at 63 per cent.
The portfolio construction has ensured good downside protection. Of the six quarters in which its category has been in the red, the fund has outperformed in five of them. Even during its worst 1-year period (November 19, 2007 to November 18, 2008), its fall of 4.69 per cent was lower than the category average (-6.69%).
Launched in October 2002, the equity exposure was capped to 10 per cent and was only raised to 15 per cent from July 2007. Since then it has averaged around 14 per cent and never dipped below 10 per cent, even during the market meltdown of 2008. Still the fund shed just 0.37 per cent that year (category average: -3.42%). From then on, the fund began to impress by way of performance.
The fund has been consistent in its dividend payment and has done so almost every month since launch. In each of the past six months, it has distributed dividend of 0.70 per cent.
Ironically, though assets have increased from Rs137.94 crore (September 2009) to Rs708 crore (December 2010), the expense ratio has increased from 1.47 per cent to 1.80 per cent over the same period.Simon Kelley

The most important thing about the Greenland ice sheet is that it is on land. So while it is ice on land it has no effect on sea level, but when it melts and the water flows into the sea then the level rises.
For large ice sheets on the ocean then the low density does matter because it means the ice floats.

Its a really interesting graph. My take on it is that the wages have lagged behind inflation for quite a while. Current wages growth is varying within the same band it has been for a while but not changing much overall, inflation looks like its at a longer term low.
It sounds like the Telegraph have a story they are telling and they're using the 'graph' like a 'graphic' to illustrate their point rather than as a scientific tool. I think this is pretty common and you have to look at all graphs you see with an eye to what they are trying to communicate. You're obviously looking beyond the message which is good.

The amount of rounding gives an indication of the confidence in the result, and the precision of the measurements. So if we were less confident or the scales only measured to the nearest 10 g then we'd probably round to two sig figs.

Our research has shown that, overwhelmingly, children on the streets share a desperate desire to get an education, to help them escape a life of poverty and hunger. Often, it's just too difficult and expensive for them to go to school, so we're bringing education to them.
We're setting up mobile libraries - project workers on bikes - and taking teaching materials to children who are more difficult to reach.

Inspite of numerous attempts to chang the order of the images I don't seem able to rectify this problem.

Deputy Prime Minister Igor Sechin, who is in charge of the energy sector, said the government was considering creating an oil production reserve ‚Äúwhich would allow it to work more efficiently with prices on the market.‚Äù Sechin would not say how big the reserves would be, but said they should be ‚Äúenough to reach efficient pricing parameters,‚Äù Russian news agencies reported. ‚ÄúOil has become more of a financial instrument than a commodity.‚Äù He confirmed that Russia wouldn‚Äôt cut oil output unlike OPEC nations, which are expected to slash production at an extraordinary session Friday. OPEC Secretary-General Abdullah al-Badri said before a meeting with Russian President Dmitry Medvedev on Wednesday that he would not ask Russia for oil production cuts as global prices fall. Analysts had said Russia was unlikely to agree to coordinated production cuts, given that it already is battling with falling output as West Siberian oil fields mature. Declining oil production is bad news for a resource-based economy where revenues from the oil industry account for about 25 percent of gross domestic product. Russia, the largest oil producer outside OPEC, has seen its stock markets bruised in recent weeks amid deepening fears of a global recession and plunging oil prices. The price of oil has more than halved since peaking at $147 in July. Crude oil in New York traded at $69.5 per barrel on Wednesday. Russian energy stocks had fallen between 6 and 7 percent on the MICEX stock exchange in mid-afternoon trading Wednesday. Russian officials have talked about setting up an oil reserve before but have not taken steps to implement such a strategy so far. Analysts have said it would require considerable investment both to buy the oil and build the necessary facilities. ‚ÄúIt is quite unclear whether (the reserve) will be able to influence prices,‚Äù said Valery Nesterov, an energy analyst at Troika Dialog. Shervani Abdullayev, oil analyst at Alfa Bank, referred to the idea as a ‚Äújabber.‚Äù ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs just a feeble attempt to stop oil prices from falling. Sechin hardly knows how prices are formed on the market and what tools we have for it,‚Äù he said.Descrizione

Why do I feel a little less safe right now?EAST GRAND FORKS, Minn. ‚Äî Rising waters of the Red River necessitated a mandatory evacuation of Sherlock Campground in East Grand Forks on Monday, Oct. 14, displacing dozens of people set to work the sugar beet harvest.
The campground in the Red River State Recreation Area was closed after 9 a.m. with campground manager Catherine Johnson going around to notify people of the closure.
‚ÄúI drove through some of those roads this morning when I was checking. I came in at 7 a.m., just because I was worried,‚Äù Johnson said. The roads she referred to, near the riverside of the campground, were underwater around noon.
The evacuation caused even more trouble, with one person driving an RV into the floodwaters in an attempt to turn around.
‚ÄúHe was down here, and he should have gone straight, but he drove down thinking he could make it, and then realized, oh, this is pretty deep,‚Äù said Johnson. ‚ÄúI think he drove in and tried to turn around. ‚Ä¶ He got hung up on the curb down there ... and it just kept digging and digging and digging a hole, and then there was no getting out.‚Äù
A tow truck eventually got the RV freed.
Brock Larson, an agriculturalist with American Crystal Sugar, was at the campground to take in the scene and check on the seasonal workers for the company.
‚ÄúIt was quite a few, over three-quarters of the campground,‚Äù said Larson, of the displaced workers.
Still, he remained hopeful that they could get back to work soon.
‚ÄúWe‚Äôre going to try to get them to work as fast as we can, if the weather cooperates,‚Äù Larson said.
People in the campground were being relocated to the parking lot of the now-closed Kmart at the Grand Cities Mall.
Pat Tasker came from South Dakota for the harvest. She said someone from Express Employment Professionals came by and told her to take her RV to the Kmart parking lot. She said she has only worked two days out of the month, due to the weather.
Sherlock campground host and third-year law school student Kathey Harouff and her dog, Nona, were in the process of packing up Monday morning, after the evacuation notice.
‚ÄúIt wasn‚Äôt always my plan to stay here,‚Äù Harouff said. ‚ÄúI was just going to stay here for the first semester, and then, when the campground closed in the middle of November, I was just going to get an apartment. I was going to get an apartment for second semester, so we just moved that plan up a month.‚Äù
She said she rushed to get an apartment and find a place to park her camper.
‚ÄúIt was pretty easy to get a spot, and it‚Äôs cheap to park,‚Äù Harouff said. ‚ÄúI put all that together between yesterday and today."
Harouff said she was aware of the rising water situation and had been keeping an eye on it.
‚ÄúWe‚Äôve been watching the water come up; I‚Äôve been taking pictures of it everyday,‚Äù Harouff said. ‚ÄúFrom yesterday to today, and then from this morning until now, it‚Äôs amazing how fast it‚Äôs come in.‚Äù
The campground will remain closed for the season.
‚ÄúI‚Äôve been here for 10 years and this has never happened,‚Äù Johnson said. ‚ÄúThis is the first time."So you‚Äôve got managed to convince that cute girl you met at the coffee shop that you just‚Äôre price her time and scored her number in the process.

This period of life will help determine the future overall health of the child.
The critical window for health
The first few years of life is a crucial period for optimal growth and development. During this time, key milestones develop: the brain grows rapidly, the immune system matures, and even early cognitive and socio-emotional relationships are established.1
Early dietary exposures of children are also shaped at this time and appears to affect body composition and disease risk later in life.2 Indeed, nutrition plays a significant role in supporting this sensitive window of opportunity. Providing optimal nutrition with the right amount of macro- and micronutrients at this critical period is needed to support adequate physical growth, metabolism, and immune development of a child. Other sufficient key nutrients to support neurodevelopment should be given as well.3
Optimal nutrition
Optimal and balanced nutrition among preschool children will allow adequate growth, strengthen immunity, provide energy, and help reduce the risk of early development of noncommunicable diseases. Nutritional challenges in this crucial time relate to giving the right quality of nutrient and avoiding excessive intake of nutrient-poor and high-calorie food.4
Managing optimal nutrition among preschool children will include providing a variety of nutrient-dense food including fruits, vegetables, grains, quality protein, and dairy products.4 Lactose-containing milk with no added sucrose can provide enough energy for the active child and optimum levels of protein in milk can help prevent later risk for obesity.
The benefits of good nutrition are undeniable. Best health outcomes were seen among children who are well-nourished in their early years of life. This window of opportunity provides a great chance to deliver the best nutrition to ensure normal growth development and help every child discover their amazing possibles.

Why it may never be possible to recommend that everyone take a supplement‚Äîas much as people want to believe
Before there was Vitaminwater, there was vitamin beer. In 1936, the Joseph Schlitz Brewing Company promised that its Sunshine Vitamin D Beer would ‚Äúgive you the vitamin D you need for year round vigorous health.‚Äù One ad explained: ‚ÄúModern living; clothing; clouds and smoke; hours spent indoors‚Äîrob us of sunshine benefits.‚Äù So, proposing to overcome the evils of modernity with yet more modernity, everyone should ‚Äúdrink it each day for health.‚Äù
If someone asked why you were now drinking daily, well, it‚Äôs because of the clouds and the clothing.
Certainty of the benefits of vitamin D supplements has grown murkier in the ensuing century. Except for the promise that the beer can had a ‚Äúscientific lining,‚Äù Schlitz‚Äôs claims were threadbare. All that was really known at the time was that this newly discovered compound was great at preventing rickets. Presumably ‚Äúprevents rickets‚Äù didn‚Äôt play well on the beer label. Sometimes morality is the enemy of commerce.
The scientific process behind the health claims was ethically fraught, too, in that it came from University of Wisconsin researchers who owned the patent on producing the compound that had recently been named ‚Äúvitamin D.‚Äù The term started as a colloquialism for what chemists know as cholecalciferol and ergocalciferol, which are not structurally or functionally similar to the other compounds widely known as ‚Äúvitamins.‚Äù
D is technically a pre-hormone involved in multiple metabolic processes but mainly known to affect the levels of calcium and phosphorus in our bodies. Though little was known in the 1930s about exactly how ‚Äúvitamin D‚Äù worked to prevent people‚Äôs bones from warping, the biochemist who patented the process of synthesizing the compound said, ‚ÄúIf the public should demand vitamin D in its beer, there is no reason why [we] should not provide it.‚Äù
The demanding people weren‚Äôt ready for vitamin beer, apparently, and Schlitz took it off the market two years later. Instead cow‚Äôs milk became the delivery vehicle for vitamin D supplements in the United States. A milk-fortification law was passed to combat the scourge of rickets. So arose the belief that drinking cow‚Äôs milk was necessary for strong bones. As the dairy industry made the case in government-sponsored advertising, vitamin D actually became a primary selling point for milk‚Äîthe reason that many Americans believe drinking cow‚Äôs milk is necessary still today. (Even though adult cows don‚Äôt drink it.)
But in the U.K. and elsewhere, the practice of supplementing milk with vitamin D didn‚Äôt stick. Debate still rages, and it took a major step into public consciousness last week with the largest study to date on the effect of vitamin D on respiratory infections. Published in British Medical Journal (BMJ), the study is a meta-analysis of 25 controlled trials of vitamin D intake and respiratory infections. The authors argue that vitamin D fortification could reduce deaths, in addition to inordinate costs from preventable sickness that lead to missed work (and can seriously threaten the health of immune-compromised people).
On BBC‚Äôs web site, the headline was ‚ÄúVitamin D Pills ‚ÄòCould Stop Colds or Flu.‚Äô‚Äù In The Guardian it was ‚ÄúVitamin D ‚ÄòProved to Cut Risk of Colds and Flu.‚Äô‚Äù There a letter to the editor from physician Jenny Goodman also declared victory, as she has been ‚Äúbanging on about the benefits, and indeed the necessity, of vitamin D for decades.‚Äù
In an editorial in the British Medical Journal, though, researchers Mark Bolland and Alison Avenell note that in places where widespread fortification is not common, studies like this have been ‚Äúprovoking passionate arguments for and against widespread supplementation.‚Äù The researchers argue that the effect was small‚Äîa reduction in risk of respiratory infections from 42 to 40 percent. ‚ÄúShould these results change clinical practice? Probably not,‚Äù they concluded. ‚ÄúThe results are heterogeneous and not sufficiently applicable to the general population.‚Äù
On a similar note, the head of nutrition science at the U.K. public-health department Louis Levy told BBC, ‚ÄúThis study does not provide sufficient evidence to support recommending vitamin D for reducing the risk of respiratory tract infections.‚Äù
Still news of the study made its to the United States, where vitamin D deficiency is still less common, and NPR said ‚ÄúA Bit More Vitamin D Might Help Prevent Colds And Flu.‚Äù Time went further, with ‚ÄúHere's How to Avoid Catching Colds and the Flu.‚Äù
The evidence on vitamin D supplements is deeply mixed, of course. At least eight other meta-analyses in the last five years have analyzed the effects of vitamin D supplements on respiratory infections, and only three found benefits. This study was a step toward understanding if fortifying foods would benefit more people than it would potentially harm, but it does not suggest that all people should begin supplementing themselves. So the nut of it‚Äîbecause all of this is understandably tough to make practical, but inevitably will be put into practice one way or another‚Äîis that Vitamin D works differently in everyone depending on their levels of vitamin K, phosphate, magnesium, and other elements of diet, as well as exposure to sunlight, clothing choices, and the amount of melanin in a person‚Äôs skin (blobs of pigment that block sunlight from creating vitamin D in the body).
There is no consensus on how much vitamin D should to be consumed by ‚Äúthe average person‚Äù for optimal health, and I doubt there ever will be‚Äîso long as people‚Äôs diets and lifestyles vary as much as they do. If we have reached a point as a global population where we need to consider recommendations wherein all people are supposed to be taking a pre-hormone every day for the rest of their lives, there is more to interrogate about how and why that could really be necessary and sufficient.
Most of our vitamin D comes from sunlight, and that creates a huge variable for any attempt at dietary recommendations. No one who works outdoors in the tropics is likely ever going to need a vitamin D supplement. Probably almost everyone who lives in Alaska in the winter (and doesn‚Äôt constantly eat fish or drink antique cans of Sunshine Schlitz) would benefit. At the latitudes in between, the amount of melanin in a person‚Äôs skin matters a lot. For people living in the U.S., the FDA‚Äôs approach seems well worded: ‚ÄúIf you are an older adult, have dark skin, or are exposed to insufficient ultraviolet band radiation (such as sunlight), consume extra vitamin D from vitamin D-fortified foods and/or supplements.‚Äù
The lead author of the BMJ study, Adrian Martineau at Queen Mary University of London, is an advocate of fortifying foods with vitamin D, as opposed to testing individuals and ‚Äútopping up those with lowest levels.‚Äù In the meantime, he recommends that people in the U.K. take a supplement during the darker winter months. Even though people in the United States are less likely to have a clinically-defined ‚Äúdeficiency,‚Äù the new study might be useful to consider for people who get a lot of respiratory infections‚Äîor for whom those infections are particularly dangerous‚Äîand considered on a person-to-person basis with a physician.
So people are elaborate ecosystems that aren‚Äôt begging for blanket recommendations. But if sales of Vitaminwater are any indication, vitamin beer today could sell extremely well. Though the only clear benefit would be to the person selling it.Everything Seattle has done in recent weeks points to the team planning on having Russell Wilson as its quarterback in 2021.
But rumors regarding Wilson‚Äôs future ‚Äî even if they have quieted markedly in recent days ‚Äî persist.
On ESPN‚Äôs Get Up! Monday morning, NFL reporter Adam Schefter said again that he thinks Seattle would be ‚Äúopen and interested in moving on from Russell Wilson‚Äù if the Seahawks could get a viable replacement in return.
‚ÄúThey wouldn‚Äôt do that (a trade) without a sure-fire quarterback solution,‚Äô‚Äô Schefter added.
That Seattle appears to have done its most significant salary cap maneuvering without restructuring Wilson‚Äôs contract ‚Äî which by pushing his salary cap hits more fully into the future would be viewed as making more of a commitment to him ‚Äî also continues to raise some eyebrows.
The Jets instead dealt the former USC standout, who was the third overall choice in the 2018 draft, to the Panthers for three draft picks, including a second-rounder in 2021.
Recall that three weeks ago, a report from the New York Daily News stated that Seahawks coach Pete Carroll has ‚Äúa high opinion‚Äô‚Äô of Darnold and speculated that the Seattle could view him as a possible suitable replacement for Wilson.
That report, though, came before the Seahawks reportedly turned down a trade offer from the Chicago Bears, which meant all four of the teams on Wilson‚Äôs list of suitable trade partners no longer appeared to be viable options (the others being Dallas, New Orleans and Las Vegas).
The Bears signing Andy Dalton basically put a death knell into Wilson trade speculation for this year.
But Schefter, whose 8.3 million Twitter followers speaks to his standing as one of the most plugged-in NFL reporters, has kept the rumor mill alive, if maybe just barely.
His report Monday, though, came before the Darnold trade later in the afternoon. And the Darnold trade might kill Wilson trade talk for now ‚Äî unless you think Seattle would have interest in Teddy Bridgewater, who the Panthers might now be inclined to trade, having appeared to commit to Darnold for the next two years (it was reported the Panthers will pick up an option on his contract for 2022).
You‚Äôd also assume at this point anything involving Houston‚Äôs Deshaun Watson can be ruled out until his legal situation is sorted out.
That all makes it pretty hard to see where a logical, immediate ‚Äúsure-fire quarterback solution‚Äô‚Äô would come from for this year.
And at some point before the draft, Carroll and Seahawks general manager John Schneider are expected to talk to the media, and a strong statement that Wilson isn‚Äôt going anywhere can tamp down the rumors for good. But this being the NFL, even that might not be enough.
One interesting footnote to the Darnold trade is that Carolina‚Äôs new general manager is Scott Fitterer, who worked from 2001 until January in Seattle‚Äôs front office, the past six years as either co-director or vice president of football operations.
The Panthers are thought to have turned to trading for Darnold after realizing they weren‚Äôt going to get one of the top three quarterbacks in the draft (they have the eighth choice) and also realizing that any attempt to get Watson isn‚Äôt viable right now.
It‚Äôs also thought they tried to get in on Matthew Stafford and might have been interested in Jimmy Garoppolo.
So, Darnold might have been something of a fallback choice for the Panthers.
But if Carroll truly had a high opinion of him, you‚Äôd assume Fitterer heard that at some point along the way and is hoping now that assessment turns out to be valid.
Seahawks make Woods signing official
The Seahawks on Monday officially announced the signing of defensive tackle Al Woods, a move initially reported 10 days ago.
Woods signed a one-year deal said to be worth up to $3 million to help replace the departed Jarran Reed, who was released and signed with the Chiefs.
Woods joins Poona Ford and Bryan Mone as defensive tackles who have experience on Seattle‚Äôs roster, with those three likely to form a rotation at that spot in the team‚Äôs base defense.
The announcement of Woods also means that all of Seattle‚Äôs reported free-agent signings have now been made official by the team.
However, as of Monday afternoon, the contract for Woods, as well as the new deal for Lockett, had not yet been processed so it‚Äôs unclear exactly what Seattle has left in salary cap room.

new oilfields in Chad. It is also going to build a 600 miles pipeline
through Cameroon's rainforest to reach the Atlantic.
Judging by the contract that has been made with the governments of Chad and Cameroon, the oilcompanies are expecting major trouble with this project. According to the agreement, Shell and partners are granted unlimited power to deal with 'cases of emergency' which 'might threaten the project'. If necesary their private security outfit can count on the assistance of the local police or the army.
The World Bank, which will decide in the very near future whether it will
finance grants for the project, harbours concerns. The Environmental Team
of the Bank has already made short shrifts of the oil companies's
'Environmental Assessments' of their plans. The impact and consequences
for the nature, threatened species, and the indigenous people have been very
sketchily chartered, and compensation for the local stakeholders has yet
to be worked out. The Commission for Environmental Impact Assssment
(which brought out a report on request of the Dutch former development
aid minister Jan Pronk) warns of 'attacks and acts of sabotage against
the project', given the risks of political instability in the countries.
When asked in parliament - in April 1998, whether he felt that Chad may well evolve into a second Nigeria, Dutch finance minister Mr Gerrit Zalm replied with a curt 'yes'.
It is only two years ago that Shell launched its new business principles
at its AGM, including a code of conduct regarding human rights and environmental
issues. Behind this rather radical shift in policy lies the Brent Spar affair,
and also the flack Shell got because of its collusive relationship with
Nigeria's military dictatorship. Shell's CEO of the time, Mr Cor Herkstr√∂ter,
took the lead in a debate about politically correct entrepreneurship.
Openness and dialogue would be henceforth the hallmark of the new strategy.
These glowing promises were met with some suspicion by Friends of the Earth in the Netherlands. For years now, environmental movements have supported their colleague organisations in Nigeria in their struggle against Shell.
'The people at Shell have changed a lot in the way they communicate. They are much more careful now', says Irene Bloemink of Friends of the Earth. Profits and Principles, the first entirely reformulated Shell International yearly Report, has only been published in Dutch and in English. That gives an idea of where they think are the people they view as a potential threat to them..'
May be that Shell's good intentions were only a clever PR exercise intended to take the wind out of its criticists' sails.
The question is whether the Oil Major has learned anything from its
mistakes in Nigeria. The new project in Chad and Cameroon, in which Shell
participates for 40% ( together with Esso and Elf, which are good for
respectively 40% and 20% of the remainder), looks like going wrong right
from the start. According to Friends of the Earth, the environmental assessments
came out too late in the day just at the beginning of this year, where as test drilling
has been allready under way, and the contracts signed two years ago.
And in March this year, over a hundred civilians were killed in massacres perpetrated for the most part by government troops attempting to regain control over the restive Southern part of Chad. The separatist movement FARF fears that the oil revenues will only benefit the presidential clique of Northerners.
Meanwhile, the environmental movement is no longer alone in being critical
of Shell's plans. The Commission for Environmental Impact Assessment
evaluated the plans of the oil companies because the Netherlands
are sitting on the board of the World Bank and wanted its voice heard in
the matter. The team of independent experts was chaired by Professor Dick
de Zeeuw, a catholic political stalward and former president of Wageningen
Agricultural University.
Their findings were rather clear. The commission's final report states, that essential information is lacking. 'On the basis of these Environmental Assessments the project nor its environmental consequences can be fully overseen.'
The commission furthermore noted that Cameroon and Chad are poor countries with weak government structures which cannot be considered politically and socially stable. The reports should have addressed all possible environmental risks resulting from these circumstances. It is also unclear 'how and where revenues will be used for poverty alleviation and how proper royalty management is guaranteed'. These factors put together result in a situation where 'ingredients are present for attacks and acts of sabotage on the project's infrastructure. Such acts will notably cause considerable environmental and social damage.'
Consultations with local communities, one of Shell's good intentions, do not meet the standards prescribed by the World Bank - on the contrary: 'the public participation took place under military escort while military actions against the rebels were taking place in the region.' The commission voiced doubts whether 'such circumstances can be qualified as an 'enabling environment' for public participation.'
There are even instances where the De Zeeuw commission qualifies Environment Assessments as 'sweatheart statements' and a 'scoping exercise'. The consortium's claims about the project 's alleged economic benefit to the local communities are nowhere buffeted by concrete facts and figures. False hopes have been raised amongst the local populations, the Commission warns.
But this unflattering review is mild stuff compared to what the World Bank
itself wrote about the consortium' plans. In 65 points, the
Bank's environmental experts demolished the environmental reports on
the Chad-Cameroon project. A selection from the report which the Bank
intentionaly leaked out this summer:
The Environtal Assessments 'do not provide an adequate basis for Bank project appraisal.' It remains unclear how the choice was made for the pipeline's corridor. The Bank demands a detailled account of the criteria taken into consideration, and wishes also to know whether a 'no-project alternative' has ever been seriously looked into.
The Bank also wonders whether the consequences of building a pipeline in a direct line towards the Atlantic Ocean have ever been properly considered, this with regard to the indigenous Pygmee population, the archeological heritage, and the bio-diversity of the rain-forest.
The oil project will cause a 'pull' on job-seekers from outside in a region where even a limited influx could have a significant impact on the lifestyles of indigenous and local people. And: 'The report does not spell out the critical treshholds for eligibility for involuntary resettlement assistance.' says the World Bank. 'Resettlement entitlements for affected people in case they choose the alternatives to resettlement need to be specifically defined.' The plan needs to be much more specific, to prevent major problems. Will the people be given sufficient time to arrive at a decision? Where the monies for compensation will come from and what the exact nature is of the promised 'assistance' will be remains obscure.
Furthermore, the oil consortium has convened a panel of independant observers who will 'advise' the Chad government in the event of problems arising from the resettlement scheme. 'This seems to imply the absense of any accountability on the part of the consortium for solving problems in project implementation' notes the Bank dryly, and goes on to demand that 'the respective responsabilities of the Government of Chad and the consortium be clearly agreed and detailled in the plan.'
For the oil companies, the importance of a loan by the World Bank is
mostly political. It represents only a fraction of the funds that
need to be mobilised to finance such a project. But with the World Bank's
fiat it becomes far easier to interest other investors. The World Bank's
decision has already been postponed a number of times. And at
the last Bank's meeting, in September in Washington, environmental groups
were staging protests outside, while the oil companies had marshalled a
team of no less than hundred lobbyists to convince the Bank of their good
intentions.
The oil consortium does not really care about the environmentalists' concerns. Friends of the Earth' Irene Bloemink: 'Elf keeps totally mum. Esso says it will only react when the definitive Environmental Assessments are out. But in the meanwhile, all other players are being bombarded with preliminary versions of key documents.' Shell is an even more special case. The open dialogue between the company and Friends of the Earth in the Netherlands has gone on the backburner since this summer. Whereas in April, Shell's CEO for Chad had told Friends of the Earth that 'the project is Chad is in accordance with the World Bank's conditions.', adding: 'but if you find things you're not happy with, come and tell us', now that the environment movement is getting support from independant quarters, the dialogue has trickled down to polite letters of aknowledgements for forwarded material.
In Chad, a member of parliament opposed to the oil project was arrested early June. Ngarledgy Yorongar lost his parliamentary imunity and has in the meantime been condemned to three years in prison for 'defamation of the state'. Since they were denied access to the relevant documents his lawyers refused in protest to conduct his defense.
In Cameroon also, notes the Commission De Zeeuw, opposition against the oil project was silenced as it would have been explained as opposition against the national interest.
Untill recently, few details were known about the contract between the
oil companies and the government of both countries. Through allied NGO's
however Friends of the Earth discovered recently that the official
agreement has reached the status of law in both Chad and Cameroon
(it has been published as such in the Statue Book, the Official
Gazette - Cameroon Law no. 97-16).
The consortium has, for all practical purposes, obtained carte blanche. The section in the agreement in which Shell and partners are granted permission to operate as a para-military outfit is convoluted in formulation but explicit in its purpose. The consortium is granted full authority to investigate any situation that might cause 'immediate danger' to the project. The oil-police is allowed 'under its sole responsibilty and without previous authorisation, to have access to any private or public land' in order to put an end to the threat. If necessary, it can count on the assistance of the local police, the army or other security services.
Further definitions of the terms like 'investigate' and 'immediate danger' are not provided.
In the very next future World Bank's president, Mr Wolfensohn must decide what
the Bank's standpoint will be with regard to the pipeline project. The
overall decision about the whole project is expected early next year.
Realistically it would take at least two years to sort out and answer the
questions put forward by the Bank own environmental assessment team.
Irene Bloemink explains why the clout of the World Bank would have major consequences. Even though a World Bank's loan has only been applied for the pipeline and the exploitation of a single oil field in Southern Chad, it would appear from both the proposed duration of the contract and the estimates about the amounts of oil to be drilled, that more oil fields will be opened in the region. This was also one of the findings of the CEIA. Irene Bloemink: 'The cumulative consequences of the potential pollution in a much larger area have not yet been researched at all.'
Going by its new business principles Shell nowadays
expects a degree of responsability towards society at large from its
employees. Beside endorsing basic human rights and values, this also
includes: 'taking account of the standards for public health, safety
procedures, and security measures which are in accordance with the intent
to contribute to sustainable development.'
Whether this is just public relations or not will show quite soon.
Friends of the Earth has started an international campaign with the motto 'Don't let Chad become a second Nigeria.' The Progressive Green Party in the Netherlands has already tabled questions in parliament about the rather extensive powers enjoyed by the consortium on foreign soil. But for the time being Shell deflects all awkward questions towards its partner Esso. Esso's issue manager has no formal position on the wide critisisms. 'The consortium is trying to answer the World Bank's questions by providing new information, this is an ongoing proces'.

As most Ventura County schools shut down by next week in response to the COVID-19 crisis, virtually all high school athletic events are being postponed and/or cancelled at least through March 20.
Nine area schools districts ‚Äî Conejo Valley, Simi Valley, Ventura, Moorpark, Las Virgenes, Oak Park, Fillmore, Santa Paula and Ojai ‚Äî all announced Thursday that they will close for at least one week beginning Monday. The Oxnard Union High School District said Friday it would also close schools beginning Monday for at least one week.
The closures come after a meeting by county school superintendents Thursday.
Volleyball matches were played Thursday night by teams in the Pacific View League, albeit with precautions. Group hand slaps traditionally staged between opposing volleyball teams at the beginning of matches were skipped.

The volleyball matches could be the last athletic games contested for at least the next two weeks. Before the announcements by school districts, Ventura High had already decided to cancel its invitational track and field meet planned for Saturday.
Steady rain forced postponements of most outdoor events, including baseball and sophomore, scheduled for Thursday and Friday.
Most schools were open Friday.
Most high schools across California are also closing campuses and suspending athletics. The CIF-State has cancelled its biggest event of the season, the state boys and girls basketball championships, that were set for Friday and Saturday in Sacramento.
The situation involving the international coronavirus continues to be fluid in Ventura County, but here's what is known:
The Ventura Unified School District has shut down its schools and all athletic events, including practices, through April 10. Affected are Ventura, Buena and Foothill Tech.
The Simi Valley Unified School District, which include Simi Valley and Royal highs, and Moorpark Unified School District will close Monday through at least Friday, March 27. Athletic activities are suspended.
The Conejo Unified School District, which includes Westlake, Thousand Oaks and Newbury Park highs, will close its schools Monday and remain shut down at least through next week.
The Oxnard Union, Oak Park Unified, Ojai Unified, Las Virgenes Unified, Fillmore and Santa Paula Unified school districts also will close their campuses beginning Monday, and suspend all athletic games and practices through Friday, March 20.
Oaks Christian School remained opened Thursday and Friday, but planned to shut down its campus for students thereafter at least through April 17.
Grace Brethren High tweeted Friday that its athletic events were cancelled from March 16 through March 29.
La Reina announced that its campus will be closed starting Tuesday through April 20, and the school will be going to "distance learning" for its students.
It's unknown what the effect will be for high school sports beyond the next two weeks. Athletic directors are reporting that most nonleague games in all sports are being cancelled.
Decisions will be made on league contests.
"We know nothing more than next week," said Rio Mesa athletic director Chris Ruffinelli. "We are shut down next week, with a decision on how to move ahead next Friday."
Summed up Jason Klein, the head football coach and athletic coordinator at Newbury Park High: "Beyond that, who knows?"

Toy Review - Danger Mouse Action Figures and More!
You‚Äôre going to want to read my review for the re-vamped Danger Mouse series on Netflix before going any further.
All done?
Good. So, having read that [You didn‚Äôt, did you? Of course not, it‚Äôs the age of the tweet after all, TL;DR. ‚Äì Ed.], you should know that I‚Äôm a huge fan of the Danger Mouse. While I certainly didn‚Äôt think about it during the run of the old show‚Ä¶and come to think of it, it really didn‚Äôt occur to me while I was binge watching the new series either‚Ä¶but around the time I finished my review, I got to thinking‚Ä¶were there any toys associated with this children‚Äôs TV program. I mean, anymore, there are ALWAYS toys. So, in a seemingly random mad dash to Amazon, I sought the answer.
And Jazwares heeded the call. Yes, there are indeed toys. That leads us to the next question: Are they any good? I can answer with a resounding ‚Äòmostly‚Äô.
Let‚Äôs get the big negative out of the way first‚Ä¶they‚Äôre small, with Danger Mouse being the tallest at 3.5 inches and Penfold the shortest at 3 inches even (and Baron Von Greenback somewhere between the two). And, in what appears to be a trend amongst toys from British properties (cough*DoctorWhoActionFigures*cough), it‚Äôs a scale that really doesn‚Äôt fit in well with any other line you might be collecting. It‚Äôs certainly not a deal breaker for me‚Ä¶but many action figure collectors do indeed concern themselves with scale.
That out of the way, I have to admit that the amount of articulation they squeezed into these figures is rather impressive. As one would expect, the pinnacle of this would indeed be DM himself. Ball-jointed shoulders and hips, hinges at the elbows and knees and neck, wrist and ankle swivels‚Ä¶I have to admit that this is more articulation than I was expecting. Having said that, you can see that the articulation can lead to breaking up the sculpt, which, if you think about it, is certainly to be expected from an action figure based off a cartoon model‚Ä¶and, again, the small size we‚Äôre dealing with. Keeping those limitations in mind, it‚Äôs clear they did the best they could and honestly, I appreciate it. While it may not look great, the figures remain fun‚Ä¶and isn‚Äôt that the most important aspect of a toy? To continue, Penfold is a step down‚Ä¶but is surprising in the articulation that is present, again, given how short he is. He‚Äôs got a swivel at the neck, shoulders (so no outward arm movement from him) and waist with universal joints on his hips (which was the biggest surprise to me). Greenback proves the weakest of the three with only universal joints on his shoulders. Additionally, the packaging says you can rest Nero on his back‚Ä¶but it‚Äôs more of a trick of balance than anything else‚Ä¶certainly not a ‚Äòfeature‚Äô.
Naturally, no super spy heads out into the field without his dashing sports car‚Ä¶so Jazwares cooked up a Mark IV Danger Car for the figures! Granted, it doesn‚Äôt do much‚Ä¶but it does what it needs to, that being that wings pop out for flight mode at the push of a button. Yeah, it‚Äôs neat that there‚Äôs an openable trunk (or boot since we are talking about British toys here)‚Ä¶but it‚Äôs too small for anything to fit in it. [So clearly DM‚Äôs agency outsourced the Mark IV‚Äôs production out to Italian supercar designers? ‚Äì Ed.] You can see from the pics that the figures fit okay in it. DM seems almost slightly too tall and requires a slight bend at the knees whereas Penfold is a bit too short and thus is prone to a bit of rolling around‚Ä¶which, honestly, probably happens in the ‚Äòreal‚Äô Mark IV, so maybe that‚Äôs a slavish dedication to cartoon reality as opposed to any shortcomings on the manufacturer or designer‚Äôs part. The only thing that can be a bit of a distraction though is that DM‚Äôs feet are behind the steering wheel, pressed up on the dash panel. Thankfully, the decals take that into account, putting the speedometer in a more central location as opposed to where it‚Äôs typically found. Still, it bugs me a little that there‚Äôs no place to put the feet under and thus better capture a realistic set up. Oh, and yes, the car is right side drive‚Ä¶so, accuracy!
Lastly, we picked up three stuffed toys‚Ä¶again DM, Penfold and Greenback. And again, they‚Äôre a bit smaller than you‚Äôd expect‚Ä¶about the size of the ‚Äòmedium‚Äô stuffed toy you‚Äôd win off a midway game at an amusement park or one of the larger items you‚Äôd find in one of those rigged claw games. The only thing to point out is that each one does have a ‚Äòpress here‚Äô electronic gimmick that gives you three sounds/phrases. Nothing that really stands out as memorable or funny (which I can honestly say because as I write this, I cannot remember what phrases they say)‚Ä¶but all applicable to the characters.
All in all, I have to say that while yes, die hard action figure fans or collectors will likely have issues with these toys‚Ä¶well, that‚Äôs just it, they‚Äôre toys. They‚Äôre fun and they‚Äôre for kids‚Ä¶with just enough articulation to make them interesting. If you keep that in mind and are a fan of the show, then these are definitely worth picking up. If you‚Äôre expecting what you typically get with 6 or 7 inch scale action figures‚Ä¶or even Playmates recent Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles line‚Ä¶you‚Äôre probably going to be disappointed.
#actionfigures #cartoons #toysTime to remind staff about seasonal scams
OK, we know it is only October but everyone seems to be gearing up for Christmas already and this can only mean that the scammers are putting the final touches to their campaigns of seasonal misery.
It is a sad fact of life that scammers target people when their guard is down or when they are at their most vulnerable. The thing to remember is that staff getting caught out by online and email scams will not only affect them but it could also damage your business. If you allow your staff to surf the internet in their lunch breaks, receive parcels at work, use their work emails to order goods and services from the internet or just access their personal emails at work then this is a great time to give them a refresher on safe use of the internet and what to do with that unsolicited email.
Below is far from an exhaustive list, but these are the kind of Christmas scams you should ask your staff to look out for.
Bargain gifts
We all want to get the ideal gifts for our loved ones over the festive period, and at the best price too. But, if the advertised price for the latest designer watch or must have toy seems to good to be true, then it probably is. Just a single visit to a malware infected website could spell disaster.
Even advertised links from legitimate websites can lead to trouble. Don't forget that adverts are usually placed on websites by third parties so you shouldn't assume that an advert has been vetted or approved by an organisation you usually trust. Remember that browsing habits change in the run-up to Christmas so you and your staff should be extra vigilant when visiting unknown corners of the internet.
Parcel deliveries
Fake parcel delivery emails can often slip through the 'common sense' net when you are expecting a deluge of packages from numerous delivery companies. As with all emails of this type, just delete them and never click on any links inviting you to order a re-delivery or track your gift.
Bank or PayPal notifications
Christmas is the busiest time of year for the banks and payment providers as consumer spending rockets. The scammers know this and often send very convincing 'phishing' emails designed to trick people into believing that there has been 'suspicious activity' on their account and that they should log in to update security details. These types of email are most definitely scams and should be deleted straight away. Remind staff to never click on links or fill in any online forms asking for password resets. If in any doubt, they should visit the provider through the channels you usually use to put their minds at rest.
Mobile app scams
Company mobile devices are often a weak point for company security and novelty or discount shopping apps can be a tempting download for unsuspecting users. Our advice is to have a secure MDM (Mobile Device Management) policy in place but, if you don't, perhaps remind staff with company devices that downloading apps they don't know anything about is definitely not a good idea!
E-Cards & novelty websites
E-cards and novelty websites seem to spring up everywhere over the Christmas holidays. But, what might seem like a laugh to share around the office, can have serious consequences for your precious company systems and data. If in any doubt, e-cards and emails with links to seasonal frivolity should be deleted immediately.
Fake charities
It's no joke that the vulnerable need our help even more over through the winter period and we would absolutely encourage businesses to help where they can. But scammers know that fake charity emails can get the 'best' response when sent at Christmas. Remind staff to be vigilant for emails claiming to be from even well known charitable organisations.
And why not help your staff to make a difference by selecting a nominated charity that you will work with over the holidays?
Romance
Christmas can be a tough time for people who don't have anyone to share the festivities with and the cyber criminals know this. Scammers can use photos, emails and even text messages to pretend to be a member of a dating website. Messages may contain phishing scams where the person can access personal information such as usernames and passwords or infect a device with malware.
This might be a sensitive topic to cover but it is worth advising staff to only use recognised and reputable dating websites.
Always remember that your staff can be the weakest link in your defence against cyber criminals. But they can also be your most effective resource for keeping your business safe. A little education and refreshing the key messages around IT security can enable staff to help in the fight against online threats.
If any of the scams mentioned here are a concern and you would like some practical advice in securing your business against online threats then please contact us today to discuss your online security with one of our experts.

About the lesson
I believe that thoroughly understanding a concept is far better than memorization and I take into consideration how a child learns best and structure my lessons and teaching method to best suit them.
I specialize in teaching students who are struggling in their classes. In my lessons, I introduce the material and break it down into simple concepts through the use of examples and analogies. I then provide practice problems with increasing difficulty. Learning can be fun, and I like to use games to teach and make lessons engaging. I also share tips on how to take tests, how to study, and how to critically think through problems.

At some point later, Malala was granted with the Nobel Peace prize that she merited. However, is any one without a doubt mindful of the degree of mistreatment and wrongdoing that has been going on against a large number of ‚ÄúMalalas‚Äù since 35 years back by the decision mullahs in Iran? What has been realized before open the wrongdoing of mullahs against the Iranian ladies is only a tip of chunk of ice of what is in fact going on in Iran. So as to have a superior comprehension of the reactionary philosophy of the Iran‚Äôs decision mullahs, it is smarter to peruse a few comments by top positioning pioneers of this system on how they see government and status of ladies.
‚Ä¢ Khomeini: ‚ÄúVelayat Faghih‚Äù(rule of mullahs) resembles deciding a mate for a child. There is no contrast among individuals and a child.
‚Ä¢ Khomeini in his book named ‚ÄúTahrir al-Vasila‚Äù: ‚Äúladies are detestable animals. In the event that a lady ceases from keeping up an appropriate spot for fulfillment of her better half, at that point her significant other has the privilege to bit her and take harder measures until she is compelled to submit.‚Äù
‚Ä¢ Rafsanjani ‚Äì June seventh, 1991:‚Äù the physical contrast among ladies and men demonstrates that men better fit all exercises. The size of cerebrum of men is greater. These distinctions are significant in deciding duties, rights and occupations of ladies.‚Äù
Indeed, with such a belief system dependent on religious autocracy and sexism of the medieval system that Khomeini set up in Iran in 1979, he figured out how to turn into the purpose of yearning for all fundamentalists in Muslim countries.
A brief glance at certain occasions identified with the state of ladies in Iran since start of the standard of mullahs in Iran in 1979:
‚Ä¢ Many ladies lost their positions for resisting Khomeini‚Äôs strict declaration of mandatory cover
‚Ä¢ Khomeini gave a declaration for assaulting of detained young ladies and taking blood of political detainees
‚Ä¢ Women comprise 33% of 120000 executed political detainees in Iran
‚Ä¢ Women and young ladies in boulevards are assaulted with corrosive and shaper for not putting on legitimate shroud
‚Ä¢ Women are stoned and tossed down from high focuses for supposed sexual charges
‚Ä¢ Taraneh Moussavi an Iranian demonstrator was scorched subsequent to being assaulted by progressive gatekeepers
‚Ä¢ Iran has the most noteworthy positioning for ladies self destruction among Middle East nations
‚Ä¢ ‚Ä¶
The couple of previously mentioned realities, make it very clear why the Iranian individuals and Iranian opposition consider the mullahs system the adoptive parent of ISIS, and why the Iranian individuals see Maryam Rajavi as their lone purpose of expectation. Maryam Rajavi is the pioneer of an opposition that has made the entire world mindful of Iran‚Äôs mystery atomic exercises. Past that, she has focused on that the danger of Iran‚Äôs fundamentalism is multiple times more than its atomic risk. In 1993, by distributing a book, the Iranian obstruction called ‚ÄúIslamic Fundamentalism‚Äù the new risk for the world, yet this call was ignored. Also, presently, the world is confronted with an influx of fundamentalism that is the immediate result of West‚Äôs approach of settlement with mullahs. Presently the stirred still, small voice of the individuals of the world have joined the Iranian obstruction and in an assembled front and in the extraordinary social occasion of Iranian opposition on June thirteenth will yell ‚Äù no to fundamentalism ‚Äì yes to a free and non-atomic Iran. No to medieval sexism and no to fear based oppression.‚ÄùCollectors Auction!Coins, Collectibles, Antiques

trying to sleep
This morning, American Airlines called Frank‚Äôs cell to suggest that we take their 1:00 flight, because the later flight, we were scheduled on, would probably not be flying out ‚Äì mechanical problems. So, we got it together and headed to Pearson by 10:30.
It‚Äôs now 6:00 pm, we‚Äôre in the Miami Airport and our flight to Lima doesn‚Äôt leave for another 7 hours.
The airport is a sprawling complex and we put in almost a mile walking from the domestic gate where we landed to the international terminal. And the international concord is a Spanish speaking area. Miami is an eastern gateway to Central and South America.
I always bring my phone and tablet charges with me, but it never occurred to me to also have my laptop charger and do some work while I‚Äôm waiting for a flight. (I‚Äôm just getting used to having WI-FI access at airports.) This is the first post, I wrote at an airport. (Frank is sitting across from me grading papers for his online course-work.)
I couldn‚Äôt sit in the uncomfortable chairs any more and just laid down on the floor. That‚Äôs the image on the right.
Sitting at the international terminal, I can‚Äôt help but think that this morning we left Canada, a country that was part of the British empire; and here we are in Florida and getting ready to go to Peru ‚Äì a country that was part of the vast Spanish empire.
A side note: Our Miami/Lima flight got posted on the Departures board as delayed an hour. When I went up to the gate-agent to ask, she told me that the flight was on-time and that I should just ignore the board. The agent made an announcement about the on-time departure, but only in Spanish. (The Departure board was never corrected.)Hi Francesca, I was searching for idioms and landed on your wonderful post. It was a really good read. Also agree with the thought that learning new languages does not require discarding the ones you already have.

You could say that "The Sentinel" is Michael Douglas trying to do a Clint Eastwood with a role which sees him playing a secret service agent who is on the case of a plot to assassinate the President. You could also say that "The Sentinel" is a movie which tries to capitalize on the popularity of Kiefer Sutherland in "24" with a character which sees Sutherland delivering on his action hero persona. And for those who enjoy watching the beautiful Eva Longoria in "Desperate Housewives" can watch the beautiful Eva Longoria in this. But one thing you can say about "The Sentinel" is that it is style over substance with action scenes being the thing which really grabs you rather than the storyline which whilst not poor is neither hugely engrossing.
Secret Service Agent Pete Garrison (Michael Douglas - It Runs in the Family) has been part of the Presidential Protection detail for a long time and it has lead to him becoming very close to current First Lady Sarah Ballentine (Kim Basinger), in fact too close as they are having an affair. But when another agent is murdered Pete discovers that there is assassination plot with a Secret Service Agent involved. With everyone a suspect Pete ends up failing a lie detector test, trying to hide his affair and in doing so becomes the main suspect in the assassination plot. Forced to go on the run whilst trying to clear his name and work out who is behind the plot he also has to deal with his protege, Agent Breckinridge (Kiefer Sutherland - Ground Control) who dislikes Pete ever since he thought he was having an affair with his wife.
Now whilst "The Sentinel" is a movie which is style over substance I actually like the storyline because it builds in a nice simple way. We go from Pete having an affair to going on the run when he fails a Polygraph test, we have another agent who Pete mentored having issues with him and heading the team who are hunting him down plus of course the assassination plot. All these things link together nicely, maybe not in the most believable away but throwing up some interesting perspectives such as how do the Secret Service get Pete when he is the man who has trained them and knows the playbook of moves inside out.
The trouble is that whilst it strings all of these elements together nicely "The Sentinel" feels so familiar that there is little too surprise you. And as such it becomes a movie less about whether or not Pete will clear his name in time to save the President but the way he goes about it. As such we have Pete sneaking around, bypassing alarm systems, following bad guys etc etc and whilst all of this is entertaining it is the same sort of thing you see in 100s of other action dramas. And it won't come as a surprise when I say that all of this means we get various chase scenes before a big action finale.
It is very much a case that "The Sentinel" trades on the action, the escapades of Pete rather than anything else and so whilst we have back stories such as David Breckinridge total dislike of Pete as he believes he had an affair with his wife, the depth of these back stories are shallow at best. And whilst I am sure many will enjoy the whole action side of things I find myself wishing that the relationships were explored a little more deeply. The whole element of Pete having taken a bullet when he protected President Reagan could have been played on more as could the relationship between the President and his wife, well she is having an affair with Pete.
Now as "The Sentinel" ends up feeling like a familiar story the performances also feel familiar. Michael Douglas delivers that touch of older Secret Service agent surrounded by younger men and women, but we also have what you could call a stereotypical Douglas character, well he does have an affair and get it on with the First lady. In a similar way we have Kiefer Sutherland delivering something we have seen him before as he runs around with gun in hand, shouting. The thing is that whilst the characters and performances are nothing new both Douglas and Sutherland deliver them well. And to be honest whilst "The Sentinel" also features Eva Longoria and Kim Basinger it is a movie all about Douglas and Sutherland being action men.
What this all boils down to is that "The Sentinel" is entertaining but it is nothing new or special, just a well put together action thriller which features an assassination attempt and a good guy on the run, trying to clear his name.Well it‚Äôs been a crazy 4 weeks to get here but here we are with our brand spanking new website ready for rawsome action with what will hopefully include lots of great information for you on all things raw and more!

Although these are considered very good practices, I believe many organizations aren‚Äôt doing it properly or even aren‚Äôt prepared for them just yet. These practices demand many cultural changes in organizations, which most of them aren‚Äôt prepared for or are welcome to changes. Just using tools and automation is not enough to achieve the cultural change needed. Many researchers and authors believe that DevOps itself already includes security in its core and although they may be right since software security is closely related to software quality. Unfortunately, that‚Äôs not the case in most of the companies adopting DevOps yet.
Many organizations are applying DevOps without thinking about Security. That‚Äôs why, I believe, a new term was created, first called Rugged DevOps, or SecDevOps, or DevOpsSec and lately DevSecOps (other terms you may found out here are Agile Security, Agile SDLC or DevOps Security). The goal of DevSecOps, in my opinion, is to raise awareness of the increasing need for security in this shifting culture using the agile and automation mindset. DevSecOps is an evolution to DevOps to make sure that security teams stop being the bottleneck for digital transformation.
DevSecOps is changing the Application Security industry by integrating security verifications and checks within the development process and reducing the vulnerabilities found before launching into production. According to Gartner, here‚Äôs their definition of DevSecOps:
‚ÄúDevSecOps can be depicted graphically as the rapid and agile iteration from development (the left side of Figure 1) into operations (the right side of Figure 1), with continuous monitoring and analytics at the core.
Currently, security testing is generally performed at the end of the application development process, which increases the risks of deployment delays and project costs. Especially if vulnerabilities that require recoding or redesign are found. Companies can overcome this problem by using the ‚ÄúShift Security Left‚Äù (SSL) approach, which according to Accenture and AWS basically says that it ‚Äúintroduces security at the inception of the development lifecycle and automates testing within the DevOps workflow.‚Äù Please don‚Äôt confuse that approach with the SSL/TLS encryption protocols. Let‚Äôs discuss some of these practices and how you can apply them in your software development scenario.
Outdated and vulnerable libraries (SCA)
One of the biggest problems related to security that organizations face is knowing what‚Äôs exactly inside their applications and how to properly and securely patch them. We can all remember the damage that was caused by Wannacry in 2017, which exploited a vulnerability that was fixed three months before the attack was launched. In the same year, Equifax was also breached, in another big attack that was news all over the world, because of an outdated and vulnerable version of the Apache Struts library, which allowed the execution of remote commands on their systems4.
Nowadays it is very rare, if not never,.‚Äù ‚Äì OWASP Top 10 2017
A great example of this issue is WordPress, a famous CMS system that has a strong and well-tested core, at least nowadays, but its themes and plugins are very problematic and unreliable since they are developed by third-party developers that don‚Äôt always follow the same security procedures and verifications in their development process as the core WordPress team.
There are many tools out there that check for outdated software on servers and even update those for you. But that‚Äôs not an easy task especially because of the incompatibility issues with legacy applications and the lack of proper regression testing to make sure everything is working properly once the updates are made. That becomes even harder when the outdated library is embedded in a custom or in-house application and the tools mentioned earlier won‚Äôt work on them. So, what can be done is to verify these issues before the application is even built, generally during the development phase or during pre-build tasks.
There are many tools available that will perform those tasks for you in many different languages and frameworks, some of them can even be integrated into your developers‚Äô IDE and they check and fix these issues before submitting any new code. OWASP has a great free tool available for Java and .NET libraries called OWASP Dependency Check, which also has plugins for CI tools like Jenkins. Other commercial tools that can help you in this process are Snyk, WhiteSource, Synopsis BlackDuck, Veracode SCA, Conviso AppSec Flow and Sonatype Nexus IQ Server.
Automated security scans (DAST)
As we mentioned before security scans are mostly performed at the end of the application development process, usually after the application has been done and it is properly working at least on a Dev or QA environment. So any issues found would either need a system update of some kind or recode to fix the application., containers, orchestrators and serverless it has become very quick and easy to create and destroy environments for testing or proof-of-concept (PoC). For a full list, please check the OWASP Vulnerability Scanning Tools list.
Security code reviews (SAST) number of vulnerabilities in your software after deployment that would need any code change. It will also give your developers fast feedback about the mistakes they are making fast feedback about the security of their applications to take action. Remember what matters to the business and try to balance security with new features.Your quick guide to flights from Townsville to Maryborough

Credit: John O'Groat Journal | 20/10/2013 | ~~
The company behind plans for a new wind farm in the Flow Country will have to overcome an objection from the country‚Äôs biggest nature conservation charity.
RSPB Scotland (RSPBS) has challenged the controversial Strathy South plan proposed by SSE ‚Äì owners of Scottish Hydro ‚Äì and described it as ‚Äúone of the most worrying we‚Äôve ever seen‚Äù.
The application for a 47-turbine wind farm has been criticised by RSPBS for its impact on breeding birds and its location, being in the middle of the Caithness and Sutherland peatlands‚Äô Special Protection Area (SPA). The tract of blanket bog, which is an important carbon store, is home to rare and endangered species such as golden eagle, hen harrier, merlin, black-throated diver, red-throated diver, greenshank and golden plover.
RSPBS fears the turbines would pose a serious risk to many of these already vulnerable bird populations in part of an area which is being proposed as a UNESCO world heritage site.
There is also concern the development would undermine a shared vision from RSPBS, Scottish Natural Heritage (SNH), Forestry Commission Scotland, Highland Council, Plantlife and the University of the Highlands and Islands to restore huge swathes of the Flow Country. Last month the Scottish Government announced ¬£15 million of new funding to support the restoration of Scotland‚Äôs peatlands.
Stuart Housden, director of RSPBS, said: ‚ÄúThis is without doubt one of the most worrying wind farm applications we‚Äôve seen in Scotland.
‚ÄúWind farms play a vital part in tackling climate change but damage to our most important places for wildlife must be minimised.
‚ÄúOver the last few years SSE have shown and we hope SSE reconsiders its plans or that Scottish ministers quickly reject this application.‚Äù
The opposition comes after SSE‚Äôs 33-turbine Strathy North wind farm, around 7km from Strathy, received consent in November 2011 and is now under way. The turbines are due to start arriving next summer, with the site expected to be operational.

Each panel in an exhibit may be presented in one of two ways:
Simple: displays the item between others as viewers scroll through your exhibit, similar to how artworks would be displayed on a gallery wall; this is the default option. In a horizontal exhibit the item will appear with the caption to the right of the image. In a vertical exhibit the caption will appear below.
Immersive: fills the screen with the image. In a horizontal exhibit the caption will overlay the image in the corner, and in a vertical exhibit it will appear below the image. This option also allows you to create a "guided zoom" in a horizontal exhibit.

The company has transformed a former retail unit on the corner of Crossley Hill and Huddersfield Road, opposite Calderdale Royal Hospital, into a ‚Äúmodern‚Äù funeral planning centre, complete with private meeting areas, visiting rooms and office space.
Nicola Smith and Peter Lowe have been appointed to lead the Halifax service, with support from David Billington who joined Full Circle Funerals in 2016.
Full Circle portfolio consists of four UK sites.
Full Circle Funerals‚Äô founder, Sarah Jones, said: ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre really pleased to have launched in Halifax, in a popular and busy part of the town. In recent years, we have supported a number of families in the area to create and pre-plan meaningful funerals, and we were receiving increasing numbers of enquiries from the Calder Valley, which made it a natural location to expand into.
‚ÄúIt‚Äôs also a coup to attract someone with Nicola‚Äôs experience and there‚Äôs no doubt Peter‚Äôs compassion and attention to detail, that he brings from his previous roles, will be a valuable asset and pave the way for him to become a successful funeral director.‚Äù
She added: ‚ÄúWe‚Äôve worked hard to create a warm and gentle funeral service, where we can offer people personalised support with a completely transparent pricing system. We are looking forward to working with local ministers, celebrants, florists and other businesses in the Calder Valley to help people create modern or traditional funerals that are both profound and genuinely helpful for those involved.‚Äù
Earlier this year, Full Circle Funerals announced its expansion into Harrogate, with a new site opening at a retail unit in the town.
Janice Lloyd and Caroline Walker will both lead the Harrogate branch. Lloyd has previously worked as a funeral director, while Walker will begin her position in March after having worked as a deputy manager at a school.(:

The bread, heated for 15 minutes in a 350 oven, is good as new, and a dinner of melted cheese always feels like a little party. A very little party.
I know that I posted a different fondue recipe before, and it was our go-to for years. But now that the children are growing up, they actually prefer this tangier, more robust version that swaps apple cider in for milk, and adds some cheddar to mix up the Extreme Mildness of the Monterey Jack.
Perfect Fondue
Serves ‚Äú6‚Äù (cough *4* cough)
Feel free to experiment with the cheese (Swiss, gruyere, etc.) and liquid (milk, broth, or even the children‚Äôs unfavorite, wine, are all viable options). Also the zestifying ingredients are, of course, fully optional.
2 cups apple cider (something light, like Martinelli‚Äôs is ideal for this)
¬Ω pound Monterey Jack cheese, coarsely grated
¬Ω pound sharp cheddar cheese, coarsely grated
2 tablespoons flour
1 tablespoon cornstarch
Dash each of garlic powder, Worcestershire sauce, and cayenne
While you heat the cider over medium heat in a medium-sized saucepan, toss the cheese, flour, and cornstarch together in a bowl until the shreds are nicely floured. Stir the cheese into the now-simmering cider a handful at a time, waiting until each handful melts (about a minute) before adding the next. When it is all melty and smooth (this will take about 5 minutes altogether), season with the optional seasonings, pour it into a fondue pot, and serve with cubed bread for dipping.
(Other good dippers include cooked potato chunks, other cooked or raw veggies of your liking, cubes of ham, and apple wedges.)
Mmm...fondue always seems like a complicated, "look for the fondue pot and do we actually own those skewer thingies or did we borrow them that one time we made it" sort of meal, but I like the idea of it as after a hard day's night sort of meal. Also, I like mine made with beer, but I will give apple cider a try, for the children's sake. :)
Sigh. All of us lactose-intolerant folks (mine developed in my early 40s) look on wistfully and wish you bon appetit!
Mine in my 30's. My stomach began to bloat like I was 5-6 mo preg. I just love cheese and milk and all things related!!! Suuuucks! Fondue, yum!!! but, alas ....
Choose hard cheese with no added lactose - cheddar for example - and lactose-free milk (if you use milk) and unless you are VERY lactose-intolerant, it will be fine! I can eat hard cheese without problems, even though ice cream, yoghurt, cream cheese, ordinary milk etc are hopeless... Apparently the longer cheese is ripened, the more the cheese bacteria digest to lactose.
Digest THE lactose.
Lactaid pills are my savior when I want a cheesy meal.You chew one right at the meal and it provides the enzymes we're missing. I just pick mine up at a drugstore; I don't think they're hard to find.
Oh anonymous, I feel your pain. Thankfully there is still chocolate fondue, and the sort where you cook meat etc. in hot broth.
We love cheese fondue in our house - it's my husband's specialty - but our recipe uses two cups of white wine and 1/4 cup of kirsch so it's nice and boozy. His recipe is a tattered old piece of paper in a plastic sleeve that we affectionately call 'the parchment'
Hmmmm... now is the time to bring out all the cheese I made with my goat milk this summer. I might have some one year old cheddar in the cheese cave. Bring on the bread! Bring on the cold! We are all set. Now where is the white wine?
I tried to make fondue about a month ago and ended up with a gluey, rubbery cheese wad. So sad. Yours looks so silky and delicious.
I'm getting a roll of white paper tomorrow - I will never have to dust our "always dusty or finger smudged" black coffee table again - and the kids will love it. Win win!
Also just wanted to comment that Santa's bringing Bohnanza, Love Letters, Candy Wrapper Puzzle and the Secret Door. I can't wait - hoping this helps me take a real break from work and enjoy some time off with the kids. Thank you for the recommendations - we've loved all of them so far!
-Amy M from IL
I like the paper on the coffee table idea! Do you fold it under and tape it? Do you end up saving them? I always love reading your posts. Thanks!
So excited. I buy the package cheese foundue at the store when I'm feeling extravagant. For some reason it's something I never thought you could make yourself! BTW, your Kale salad has become a staple in my house. So easy and so tasty! Thank you!
OMG!!!! I want some of that so badly. Love fondue and haven't had it in more years than I care to remember.

Prior to beginning any type of strength--training program, it is essential that you undergo a needs analysis. This analysis will help you determine your current physical condition and help you decide what exercises will best help you achieve your goals. Additionally, a needs analysis aids you in creating clearly defined goals that will help you make the most progress from your training.
Physical Examination
The first step in a needs analysis for a strength-training program is to ensure that you are healthy enough for exercise. Have a trained medical doctor evaluate your current physical state, including your blood pressure, heart rate, body mass index and medical history for any potential problems. In the book ‚ÄúDesigning Resistance Training Programs,‚Äù authors Steven Fleck and William Kraemer also advise that you analyze your injury risk. For example, women have a higher incidence of knee injuries that must be considered.
Physiological Application
Whether you are training for a sport or to better perform daily tasks, the exercises in your strength-training program need to simulate the motions you are training for. On his website Sport-Fitness-Advisor.com, certified sports trainer Phil Davies states that a strength-training program may begin with general conditioning exercises, but should eventually transition into exercises tailored to your specific needs. If you need to develop explosive strength, load your exercises with heavy weights and perform short sets, for example.
Biomechanical Analysis
Because it is easy to injure your body when strength training, understanding the strengths and weaknesses of your exercising form before you begin is important. Have a trainer watch your form while exercising to point out any techniques that you may need to improve. If you do not have access to a trainer, use a mirror or visual recording device so you can make the analysis yourself. According to the National Council on Strength and Fitness, carrying out an effective biomechanical analysis will improve the efficiency of your training and reduce your chances for injury.
Exercise Selection
Choosing the exercises you need to meet your goals is one of the most complex steps of a needs analysis. The American Sports Medicine Institute says to consider a great number of factors, including developing muscles in a balanced way, motion and power specificity and your individual body type. Davies adds that even though you may be training for a specific need, your program should still encompass a full-body training regimen for balance..World / China Suspect in Beijing Child Abuse Scandal: 22-Year-Old Teacher RYB Education 'extremely shocked and distressed' about her alleged crimes By Newser Editors and Wire Services Posted Nov 27, 2017 7:57 AM CST Copied In this file photo from Friday, a woman carries a child as they arrive at the RYB kindergarten in Beijing, China. (AP Photo/Ng Han Guan) View 1 more image (Newser) ‚Äì Authorities in China detained a woman suspected of abusing children at a Beijing kindergarten run by a US-listed company in a case that has caused nationwide anger. Police in Beijing's Chaoyang district said in a statement Saturday that an investigation into a kindergarten run by Beijing-based RYB Education has led to the criminal detention of a 22-year-old female teacher on suspicion of abusing children. The statement, posted on the district police account on the Sina Weibo microblog platform, identified the woman only by her surname, Liu‚ÄîCNN notes Chinese police often don't provide suspects' full names‚Äîand didn't provide further details on her. RYB Education, meanwhile, said it was "extremely shocked and distressed" about the crimes the teacher is suspected of committing. The statement didn't provide details of Liu's alleged abuses. story continues below RYB said it had fired Liu, removed the head of the kindergarten, and is cooperating with further investigations. It also said the company is hiring doctors and psychologists to aid the children who'd been affected, as well as inspecting other branches. The Beijing scandal erupted after local media quoted parents as saying their children were forced to strip as punishment and were found with unexplained apparent needle marks on their bodies. The claims couldn't be independently verified. Chaoyang police said a 31-year-old Beijing woman, who Reuters notes is also surnamed Liu, was detained after admitting to spreading false info about the involvement of a military regiment in sexually abusing the children. The statement said the woman expressed "deep regret" for her actions. RYB and its franchisees operate 1,300 day care centers and nearly 500 kindergartens in 300 Chinese cities.

WEG has recently supplied to the leading provider of fully integrated turnkey Power Generation projects with complete Engineering, Procurement and Construction (EPC) EGESIM Enerji Elektromekanik VE Elektrik Taahhut, a pressurized synchronous generator Model SPI 1120, for a green field project at a geothermal power plant located in Buharkent / Aydin province, Turkey.
Featuring 18,389kVA, 1500rpm, 11,000V, 50Hz, this pressurized generator will be coupled to an Atlas Copco turbo-expander for power generation at the Turkish geothermal power plant.
In terms of operating arrangements, the steam from the subsoil drives the turbo-expander, which will drive the WEG generator, hence producing energy. Due to the presence of H2S gas (hydrogen sulfide), a pressurized generator (Exp) was designed to have an internal pressure in the generator greater than the external pressure, avoiding the contact of the hydrogen sulfide with the internal parts of the generator.
In reference to worldwide raw material platform, there are few countries that have this natural resource available today. Therefore, these projects are always very much disputed by machinery suppliers. Turkey, Iceland, some countries in South America and Asia are the countries that can take advantage of such natural resource.
For EGESIM, the high efficiency synchronous generator represents another key product delivered to a renewable power plant and guarantees large-scale clean energy production level.
This is the first purchase order placed by EGESIM, where Atlas Copco recommended WEG due to the traditional supplies made previously to them for similar projects.
EGESIM stands out by taking on the role of complete EPC by providing a turnkey project to the final customer Limgaz Buharkent Jeotermal.
This power plant¬¥s operating lifetime is expected for a minimum of 20 to 25 years. When it comes to power generation, where the consumption demand tends to increase over the years, the return on invested capital by the final customer will occur long before this period.
About Geothermal power generation:
It is the utilization of the thermal energy (natural heat) available in the earth that is converted into electricity with a generator through a phenomenon called electromagnetic induction in a cleaner way. The advantages arising out of this process include high-energy efficiency production index, low CO2 emissions, and when compared to fossil fuels, it is regarded as a renewable energy.In 2014, March of Dimes is leading an effort to restore funding for the Black Infant Health (BIH) Program in the California budget. Your voices and support will be critical to help successfully advocate for the Legislature and the Governor to restore this funding.
There is a tremendous need for the BIH Program as Black infants have the highest rates of infant mortality and preterm birth among all racial and ethnic groups. The BIH Program is a successful program that helps to improve the health of mothers and babies by addressing all of the complex factors that contribute to these health disparities. Even though this program has proven successful, the California budget situation was so difficult several years ago that significant funding for the program was cut from the state budget. These cuts had a devastating effect on the BIH Program, including staff reductions, fewer women served and the closure of BIH sites.
Given the continuing need for this program, its proven success and the state‚Äôs improving fiscal outlook, the time is right to reinvest in the BIH Program. March of Dimes has identified this issue as our top advocacy priority for 2014 and will be working with a coalition of partner organizations to get this funding restored.
Be on the lookout in the coming months for opportunities to contact your legislators on this critical issue. Thank you for your support!

And even though we‚Äôre just a few chromosomes different from these apes, the differences are massive. Apes look different, they act different, and they communicate differently as well. But the intelligence of these primates is advanced, compared to that of other animals.
In recent years, scientists have found new and improved ways to interact and ‚Äúspeak‚Äù with apes, through the use of laptops, computer screens and even iPads.
Researchers at the Bonobo Hope Great Ape Trust Sanctuary in Des Moines have developed a variety of custom software in order to communicate with these primates. But they need more funding to make their Bonobo Chat app a reality, and provide each of their apes with personal, interconnected keyboards that they can carry around wherever they go.
They also want to add the ability for the app to automatically translate English speech to Lexigrams that the apes understand, and vice versa. In addition, they want to allow the apes to use the app to interact with their environment, opening doors, operating vending machines and even operating robots. Yes, apes will soon be controlling their own robots from their iPads.

North America is facing endless greed. People constantly succumb to their desire for more - more food, more clothing, more gadgets - without thinking about what these products are made of, how they were manufactured, and from where they were shipped. Before steps to stop environmental damage can be taken, people must realize that insatiability and sustainability cannot coexist. Our earth has limited resources, and if we continue to push their limits by demanding more, the environment‚Äôs delicate balance will be permanently damaged.
So what makes an environmentally friendly consumer? The key is to learn about products and act on the information. Ask questions like ‚ÄúWhat is that made from?‚Äù ‚ÄúHow was it made?‚Äù and ‚ÄúWhere was it shipped from?‚Äù Without being aware of this information, positive product choices cannot be made. Perhaps the next time you go to the grocery store, you‚Äôll want to know if the food you eat is genetically modified or organically grown. Or the next time you buy clothes, you‚Äôll check if the label says ‚ÄúMade of 100% organic cotton‚Äù and ‚ÄúSweatshop free.‚Äù If not, you are supporting the effects of tampering with and contaminating nature through the unnatural practices of GMOs and pollutants.
Perhaps you are not concerned about how your choices may affect the environment, but if you discovered that these choices were killing you, your family, friends, and other organisms that inhabit Earth, then you might be concerned. The pollutants responsible for damaging our environment may be just as responsible for causing allergies, asthma, and cancer. So, why should we become green consumers other than for ourselves? Think about it.I didn't think I'd be writing about Stanislaw Burzynski again so soon, but to my surprise a very good article in Newsweek describing cancer quack Stanislaw Burzynski popped up in my Google Alerts yesterday. I hadn't expected much in the way of news coverage about Burzynski for several months, given that the second half of Burzynski's trial before the Texas Medical Board had been delayed by his having suffered a heart attack and isn't expected to begin again for several months. Entitled Cancer "visionary" Stanislaw Burzynski stands trial for unprecedented medical malfeasance and by Tamar Wilner, it's the sort of article I like to see in the mainstream media but, unfortunately, fail to see often enough. Instead, unfortunately, far more common are articles and films using sympathetic cancer patients to try to defend Burzynski. I say I was "surprised" by it because, although I do remember being in contact with Wilner in November, I had more or less forgotten about our exchange and had no idea when or if the article would be published. I have, after all, learned over the years that just because a journalist contacts you about an article doesn't necessarily mean that the article will ever see print.
The Newsweek article begins with the story of a patient. It's one who I haven't blogged about before, surprisingly:.
It turns out that Cohen is like a lot of Burzynski patients about whom I've blogged. She appears to have been helped by conventional medicine but credits Burzynski, although it's not clear to me whether she is joking or not, as the passage is somewhat ambiguous:
Sandra Cohen is a Burzynski success story‚Äîsort of. She went to him seeking antineoplastons, and when she didn‚Äôt qualify, she reluctantly started on chemotherapy and later agreed to surgery. Five years later, she is cancer-free. ‚ÄúDr. Burzynski saved my life,‚Äù Cohen says.
I wish there had been a bit more detail given, as it's very difficult for me to analyze this case the way I've analyzed other Burzynski patients. More important is the description to a wide audience of Burzynski's malfeasance. Kudos to the editor who chose the term "unprecedented medical malfeasance" to describe Burzynski's activities over the last four decades. If there is a precedence to what Burzynski has done, I am unaware of it. Certainly, I'm unaware of anyone who's practiced this way as long as Burzynski has and gotten away with charging patients such outrageous fees to administer an unproven cancer medication. As I've discussed more times than I can remember, he's been doing this at least since around 1977, possibly earlier.
Let's recap the TMB charges:
In a 48-page complaint, the Texas Medical Board says Burzynski and his staff knowingly misled patients, attracting them to the clinic with the promise of being included in trials for antineoplastons, when they knew most of the patients wouldn‚Äôt qualify. The doctor or his staff told patients they would get the antineoplastons, before charging large retainers and ordering other treatments. The Burzynski clinic admits that about 5,700 of its 8,000 patients have received treatment other than antineoplastons.
Yes, this is the "bait and switch" Burzynski does. When he can't give antineoplastons because a patient doesn't meet the inclusion criteria for one of his trials, Burzynski offers him his incompetent version of "personalized gene-targeted cancer therapy" for dummies often containing sodium phenylbutyrate, all the while bragging risibly about being a "pioneer" in the field of genomic medicine.
I also like how Wilner grasps the essence of Burzynski's "make it up as you go along" claims for his "personalized gene-targeted therapy":
On its website, the Burzynski Clinic says it offers ‚Äúpersonalized cancer therapy,‚Äù using genetic analysis to customize treatment for each patient. But in expert testimony for the medical board, Dr. Cynthia Wetmore, director of the Center for Clinical and Translational Research at Emory‚ÄìChildren‚Äôs Pediatric Research Center in Atlanta, said, ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs not a possible way to tell what drug is helping and what drug is not helping. The drugs are given in unstandard [ sic ] combinations that never have been tested. They‚Äôre given in unstandard doses that are not known to be effective or safe. And combining them is experimenting on humans, which cannot be done outside a clinical study. That‚Äôs unethical. ‚Äù
Indeed.
Burzynski's response sounds reasonable if you don't know what he's really doing:
Burzynski takes a different view‚Äîhe says the drug combinations are evidence of his innovative approach to medicine. In an email to his former lawyer, Richard Jaffe, in January 2015, he wrote, ‚ÄúIt takes a single pioneer to abolish dogma and save countless lives. This is our contribution to medical science.‚Äù Burzynski argued that it‚Äôs unfeasible to restrict practitioners only to tested drug combinations, because with almost 100 cancer drugs, testing every combination of five agents would result in ‚Äúhundreds of thousands of trials.‚Äù
Well, yes, that's true in a way, but that's not the only way to do proper clinical trials of new drug combinations based on genomic testing. Has Burzynski ever heard of, for example, the SHIVA trial? Basically, it was a large clinical trial testing conventional therapy for cancer against molecularly targeted therapy based on tumor molecular profiling. Patients with metastatic cancer would be randomized to standard of care or to the sort of approach that Burzynski does. The difference, of course, is that the doctors doing the gene profiling know what they are doing, at least as much as it is possible to know in an area like this, given the uncertainties. They also had very carefully defined protocols about what to choose when certain gene mutations popped up. Guess what? The trial still disappointed. There was no difference between conventional treatment and personalized therapy in progression-free survival. I still believe there's great promise for "precision medicine" using gene profiling to guide therapy like this, but it's clear that we haven't figured out how to do it right yet and that we lack good drugs for a lot of the molecular targets we discover.
Is there any reason to think that Burzynski can do it right when the best minds in genomic medicine have yet to crack this nut? No, there is not. I was particularly heartened to see Andrew Vickers agree. Vickers, you might recall, doesn't like skeptics very much because of‚Äîshall we say?‚Äîa bit of insolence aimed at his acupuncture studies. In any case, Wilner recounts what regular readers have heard about since 2011, namely how Burzynski charges huge sums of money as "case management fees" to administer antineoplastons, how he downplays the toxicity of his magic antineoplastons, and how he has misinterpreted imaging studies. She even quotes Burzynski's lawyer's famous remark about how Burzynski's clinical trials were a "joke" designed to let him treat whomever he wanted to treat with antineoplastons.
Wilner also asks a question that we all ask: Why does the FDA let these studies go on? The response is unsatisfying. First, as with most skeptics who've tried to ask the FDA the same question, the FDA simply refused to answer, leading to this observation:
Yale University oncology professor Joseph Paul Eder argues that it‚Äôs not really the FDA‚Äôs job to stop trials just because a drug doesn‚Äôt do anything. The system isn‚Äôt built that way. ‚ÄúTypically, whoever‚Äôs funding [the trial], the institution, NIH, or somebody else, would say, ‚ÄòYou‚Äôre not meeting your goals. We‚Äôre going to need to stop the study,‚Äô‚Äù Eder says. Since Burzynski funds his own trials‚Äîat least in part through patient fees‚Äî and hasn‚Äôt established a partnership with any institution, there‚Äôs never been anyone to apply the brakes.
Technically, Eder is correct, but the answer is unsatisfying. Technically, it's the job of the institutional review board and/or funding source to stop the trial. Of course, as I've documented before, Burzynski's IRB is run by one of his cronies, and there's no funding source to answer to. It's a loophole that Burzynski's been slithering through for 38 years.
However, it's not entirely true that the FDA has no role. The FDA often has a lot to say about the design of clinical trials to be performed in order to develop evidence to use in support of an application for FDA approval, which is what Burzynski's trials are intended for, at least if you believe Burzynski and his sycophants. Also, as we have seen, the FDA has shut Burzynski's clinical trials down many times, seemingly never permanently despite massive violations of federal regulations overseeing clinical trials. Apparently, even the death of a child is not enough for the FDA to shut Burzynski down permanently. After each time the FDA inspects him or issues partial clinical holds, Burzynski issues soothing responses that somehow convince the FDA that, yes, this time Burzynski really, really, really will be good and play by the rules. In this, the FDA reminds me of Charlie Brown, with Burzynski being Lucy, who promises not to pull the football away again but always does.
And so it has been going for nearly 40 years.
Will the TMB finally stop Burzynski this time, afte so many failed attempts before. Will 2016 finally be the year that he's shut down? It probably won't be in 2016. With all the delays, it's highly unlikely that the TMB will be able to issue a decision this year now. I am, however, still hopeful for 2017.
But not too hopeful.
I read this as being facetious. That is, Ms. Cohen went to Burzynski, didn't "qualify" for his bogus trials so sought conventional treatment elsewhere; thus Burzynski sort of saved her life. I do enjoy seeing Burzynski getting a wider audience for his shenanigans. Well done.
Personally, I think it's kind of unclear whether she was serious or not. If she were joking and I had written it, I would have added a cue to make it very clear, such as, "She said, jokingly" or "She joked."
Do we know how Dr. B's recovery from that heart attack is progressing? The 15 January post linked above mentions that Dr. B needed to undergo a series of procedures as part of that recovery. Sometimes that process goes smoothly, but sometimes it doesn't, and it sounds to me like there is a nonzero chance that Dr. B will be retiring involuntarily no matter what the TMB decides.
The FDA certainly has options available to them to shut down Burzynski's clinical trials. OHRP could also take action, as could the FTC.
Frankly, I'm amazed that FDA hasn't revoked his IRB's authorization to approve studies, given the number of violations they've had, many of which have gone unanswered.
Oh agreed. That particular paragraph is not clearly written.
Todd@4: IIRC Burzynski has some powerful allies in Congress--the sort who can hint to the FDA top brass that bad things are likely to happen to their budget if they are too aggressive in going after Burzynski. So while they might in theory have the power to go after Burzynski's IRB, in practice they don't. Of course that's a bad precedent because any other IRB they threaten to shut down can point to Burzynski's IRB, but that's power politics for you.
"Sandra Cohen is a Burzynski success story‚Äîsort of. She went to him seeking antineoplastons, and when she didn‚Äôt qualify, she reluctantly started on chemotherapy and later agreed to surgery. Five years later, she is cancer-free. "
Wait a second...she had three mets then reluctantly started chemotherapy and surgery? And she's now cancer free? Last I heard, metastatic BC is incurable.
I call this for what it is...more anecdotal BS.
I'm inclined to agree with Eric @ 6: powerful friends in Congress.
This by way of what happened to FBI and Missouri State Police after they each published reports on domestic terrorism that highlighted groups such as "militias" that have sympathizers in Congress. The Congresscritters kicked up a storm and the law enforcement agencies stopped discussing the subject in public. Though, as we see with FBI & Oregon State Police's brilliant handing of the Malheur/Bundy situation (a couple dozen arrests and only one casualty, when it could have been a couple dozen casualties including law enforcement & innocent civilians), backing down in public didn't interfere with doing their jobs effectively.
It would appear that if Burzynski does have allies in Congress (he only really needs one for this), they have successfully cowed FDA. That would be an excellent topic for further investigative reporting. Ideal case, get the goods before November so the voters can weigh in.
Something else to consider. What's the probability that Brzynski is trying to run out the clock on the election, on the basis that certain candidates' stated views (such as supporting anti-vax BS including "parents' right to choose") imply that they may be more friendly to Brzynski continuing his activity? If that's the case, then depending on what happens in November, he may be able to extend his free ride for some additional years (depending on which elected office is relevant here). This calls for more journalism, but pinning down candidates on all the relevant issues will not be easy.
Reasonable people should prefer that government agencies can do their jobs regardless of politics, and ensuring that outcome requires an informed & engaged public.
_Newsweek_ got the ball rolling here, so that's a good start.
Wasn't there some work being done to get one of the House committees to investigate why FDA allowed Burzynski to start doing his trials again? If Bob Blaskiewicz is reading, any updates on your efforts?
Good article. I am somewhat surprised because usually they are way more biased to the pro-quackery side. We can only hope that somehow Burzynski will be shut down so that he can stop profiting off of other people's desperation.
I can't say I'm "amazed" by regulatory inaction... 'Puzzled' maybe? I too find Prof. Eder's explanation, errr, "unsatisfying". It seems Burzynski may be in a bit of a gray area, but one where the FDA has the latitude to do something if they wanted to, and thus 'it's not our job' translates as 'we don't want this to be our job". So we're still left with "why?".
And I'm curious about the nitty gritty of how this works. "Powerful allies in Congress" might be one clue, but it doesn't strike me as any kind of thorough explanation. I can't imagine pols with power being willing to expend that much of their political capital protecting the Burz. If he has allies of the sort that can influence the FDA by dropping hints about budgets, hat doesn't mean they'd necessariy do that for him. To the extent Stan has friends in high places, I wonder who they are (have any names, Eric?), just how friendly they are, how much they're willing to do for him, and most importantly what their motives might be. What do Stan ‚Äì or doing things that help Stan (perhaps incidentally/) ‚Äì offer them in return?
It might not take much to disuade the FDA. I'm sure they have a lot on their plate, and a finite budget of funds and person-hours to use in pursuing the greater good. They may have looked at Burzynski, and just on the basis of the legal skills of Richard Jaffe, done a cost/benefit analysis that concluded the good done by reining in Stan wouldn't warrant the difficulty and expense in comparison to other uses their resources. Or, if they were on-the-bubble about, just a slight amount of friction might have tipped the scales.
As Orac suggested in an earlier post, renewed interest in the Burz by the TMB may be due to Jaffe's departure as his attorney. Perhaps that change will change the calculation for the Feds as well. ??
However, outside of the whole domain of medical licensing and regulation, if Stan is running a bait-and-switch scam by making false claims about eligibility for the antineoplastons, you'd think that would violate the same general legal provisions that make that a no-no for appliance and automobile dealers. Forget the Medical Board, I'm wondering why Stan's not on trial before criminal court. Where are the Texas Attorney General, and/or the prosecutors in Stan's jurisdiction on this? If they're shrugging or turning a blind eye, I wonder why that's the case. What do they gain from inaction, or would they potentially lose by acting?
So ol'Stan had a heart attack? Deep down, the primal savage in me is disappointed he didn't bite the bullet. In an "eye for an eye"-kind of sense he more than deserves to die considering how many people he has actually killed, how many families and loved ones he has robbed.
But then I am quick to correct myself in that it is wrong to wish Death upon someone - no matter how big of a scumbag they are.
Todd: The FDA has proved to be perfectly opaque on the matter. A couple of people have tried to piece it together, but still nothing. Basically, the FDA is saying, "Well, he addressed our concerns." BUT HOLY SHIT ALL THE F-ING CONCERNS, is the right response to that. And I have no confidence in the ability of the Clinic to improve. They've said they'd get better in the past and have if nothing else gotten worse. It's frustrating. We're not done pushing this issue, though.
Re. Amethyst @ 12:
Unless one believes oneself to have supernatural powers, or influence in the decisions of a deity, there is no moral culpability in making wishes.
It's only morally wrong to wish death upon someone if there are means by which the wish would be carried out. For example by engaging in stochastic terrorism: wishing out loud on the radio or TV, to whip up a public hate-frenzy that will foreseeably cause an unknown random actor to carry out the deed.
As rational people, we should steer clear of the magical thinking by which "wishing" is considered to have any operative efficacy other than upon the mind of the wisher. With all manner of fictional media from novels to video games, stable individuals can entertain disturbing notions without the least desire to act upon them; some unstable individuals will be influenced to copy the fictional behavior. Wishes are like that: fictions akin to daydreaming about winning the lottery.
Moral issues aside, wishing is a waste of time: rational activists don't sit around wishing, they seek to bring about practical outcomes. In the present case, by urging FDA to revoke the Burz' (hat tip to Sadmar) means of "experimenting" on hapless cancer patients, and by urging the relevant authorities in Texas to revoke his license to practice medicine.
@Bob
Thanks for the update. The FDA's response is incredibly frustrating. I mean, the fact that he hasn't progressed on his dozens of phase 2 trials alone should be sufficient to close those down. No promise of completion or meaningful results means there is no justification for experimenting on the few people who are enrolled. It's putting them at risk for zero benefit. And that in itself is grounds to shut down the IRB for not doing its job and protecting subjects.
As someone with IRB experience, this is incredibly frustrating.
#14 - Errr... my feeling of it being wrong of me to wish Death on another human being does not stem from my belief that it would have any actual effect of that nature...
It is just a shitty thing to do, I guess. Yet as I was saying, I wouldn't exactly be mourning if he had dropped down dead.
Wow errrr... kinda spooky how my auto-correct in I.E wants to capitalize "death" by default - make it seem as I'm talking specifically about the Grim Reaper himself!
Even if Count Scamula drops dead or the TMB somehow manages to prevent him from practising medicine, isn't his son Greg poised to carry on the family business?
Amythist@ 17:
The capital D made it appear that you were endorsing some kind of "wishing makes it so" woo. That's what prompted me to post my comment.
The arguable purpose of AutoCorrect is to make sure brand names are spelled right, for purposes of making it easier to click the Buy button. Along the way it does to written conversation what crappy cellphone audio does to spoken conversation, as you see.
Take control and turn it off. Humans can think and write for ourselves without some obnoxious AI golem trying to edit our every word.
@ Science Mom:
My thoughts exactly.
As one of those people who has tried to piece things together, with the people I know at the FDA, it appears that the general consensus is:
1) They know his treatments are BS
2) They lost badly when they went after him the first time
3) They are guaranteed to lose the PR fight
4) The number of "patients" he treats is relatively low, therefore, from a resources perspective, it doesn't warrant the resources, pain & agony, etc. to shut him down.
I hate that this appears to be the consensus, but it does explain their relatively lack of activity.
Please, TX board, please. Pull Burzynski's license. Please.
Oh, and, if you have been diagnosed with any potentially dangerous illness such as cancer, please. -- pretty please with a cherry on it -- please research the efficacy of any proposed treatment before committing to it. Chemotherapy has a carefully vetted and highly proven track record ; Burzynski NeoPee doesn't . Homeopathy doesn't. Herbal nostroms do not.
Re. Lawrence @ 21:
That sounds highly plausible. Next step: try the IRS. Unless The Burz has serious accountants and tax lawyers ensuring that his filings are perfect, there is bound to be _something_ amiss.
What's needed is a couple of hours of consultation with a forensic accountant, to find out what The Burz' likely tax filing vulnerabilities are, in light of what is already known about the way he does business. This should lead to some testable predictions, e.g. "If Burz is fiddling his taxes using method X, then we should observe that he does Y and Z." Next, keep an eagle eye out for signs of Y and Z, and upon observing them, report him to the IRS on suspicion that he is doing X.
One likely place to start: W2 vs. 1099: employees vs. "independent contractors." Many companies are in potentially hot water with this item, it is very common. Another possibility is with regard to product inventories and "use tax" liabilities (if you sell Q, you have to charge sales tax; if you use Q while performing service R, you have to pay use tax on your usage of Q), though sales & use tax is a state issue rather than federal.
Remember, many a badguy who managed to avoid arrest for his actual crimes, has been taken down for his tax irregularities.

Suddenly, I am picturing Burzynski being visited by a seven foot tall skeleton wearing a robe of infinite blackness, with two blue lights for eyes, weilding a scythe, and riding a white horse named Binky.
EXCUSE ME, MR BURZYNSKI. IT SEEMS SOME PEOPLE ON THE INTERNET WISH ME TO MEET YOU. WOULD YOU BE INTERESTED IN TEA AND BISCUITS? DON'T TRY THE SAUSAGES.
Gray Squirrel:
Hah! I've turned it off in three different places on my phone, and it STILL wants to autocorrect. Somewhere, there is still a setting hiding SOMEWHERE that thinks it knows what I mean.
Not as bad as Spell Check in Word, which attempts to automatically detect language and load the appropriate dictionary, and which is sophisticated enough to notice when language changes within the same document. Unfortunately, if you have a lot of acryonyms or code snippets it does a really terrible job. For some reason, the acronym table in my Version Description Documents is usually detected as French, while some of the build procedures are declared to be alternately Nynorsk and Norsk Bokmal.
@#24
LOL - If that happens, I hope it has a Ebenezer Scrooge-like effect on him and he turns his life around.
Several things jump out at me (and raise my blood pressure) every time I read about that dirtbag:
The FDA's job is precisely to shut down dangerous quackery. If they lack the resources to do so we should all be howling and demanding adequate funding and legal power for them to do their job. No government agency should be in the position of having "concerns" which a high-powered lawyer can explain and threaten away, to the ongoing detriment of the patients they are supposed to protect. The FDA should have the power to close the clinic and prevent it from opening until every single documented violation has been corrected. Allowing it to remain open while he continues his human experiments is despicable and dangerous. And the clinic has the body count to prove it.
The FDA's continued failure to shut him down for fraud is what gives his "clinic" an aura of respectability that it should not have. I hold them responsible.
Medical licensing should be federal, not state by state. One would think that science standards should be uniform, not open to the interpretation of individual states with political agendas. Clearly, the state of Texas is not qualified to regulate the practice of medicine, or they would have shut down the clinic decades ago.
Where does he go for medical treatment? Does he rely on "mavericks" for his cardiac issues, or does he follow standard accepted medical treatments in real hospitals? He should be willing to run the same risks with his own health that he blithely inflicts upon his patients. Yes, I know that cardiac issues are not the same as cancer, but science is science. If oncology patients can be experimented upon at their own expense and without informed consent, he should be equally confident in dismissing standard practices for his own health, and on his own dime, just like his own patients.
Burzynski charges outrageous amounts to administer unproven cancer medication?
How long will I have to wait for you to mention something about the fact that your acceped cancer treatment is not much different?
Give us your top 10 proven cancer treatments & their prices.
Just because you can't prove something doesn't mean you can discount it either.
Don't a lot of Burzynski's patients go to him after they have gone down the path of your accepted cancer treatments ?
After chemo & radiation treatment where most people get left with an immune system unable to function,it's no surprise Burzynski can't perform miracles on everyone.
I'm sure your accepted cancer treatments have left them to ill to fight off their cancer.
Please do a price comparison on Burzynski's cancer treatment & your accepted cancer treatment
You & your arrogant loyal followers haven't made one contribution to the advancement of cancer treatment
You just push drugs that don't work for big companies that only care about money.
That's a fact.
Your scum.
@Ronnie:
1. No reputable institution charges for clinical trials. Burzynski charges thousands of dollars and forces people to buy chemotherapy (yes, that's what he's giving) from his pharmacy for extreme markups.
2. Reputable institutions have treatments covered by health insurance. Show me ANY insurance in the world that covers Burzynski. While I'm not saying insurance covers everything, it does cover (if you have it) some or most of the costs.
3. You came here with the assertation. You prove, medication for medication, that accepted cancer treatments cost more than Burzynski charges.
(By the way...I doubt you meant to sign off "your scum" although maybe you did. It's a curious thing to call yourself. If, however, you meant to call Orac scum, the phrase would be "you're scum")
However, I doubt you'll be back; I'm sure you're just a drive-by troll.
Ronnie:
In case you drop back by. . .
My wife has multiple myeloma, stage 3. Her chemotherapy includes Velcade, dexamethasone and thalidomide. The cost of each:
Velcade: $9,000 per month
Dexamethasone: $10 per month
Thalidomide: $6,000 per month
Our cost, after our out-of-pocket limit is reached*:
Velcade: $60 per month
Dexamethasone: $0.04 per dose!
Thalidomide: $72 per month
Glad I could help!!
*Early January, best I can tell.
@Ronnie
Believe it or not, there are actually rules about charging for experimental drugs in clinical trials. For the most part, it isn't allowed. Only under certain situations is it acceptable. You can read more in this post.
Burzynski has gotten around this little legal requirement by calling it a "case management fee", rather than a charge for the drug.
Opus, perhaps you could tell us, does your wife's doctor charge a case management fee of tens of thousands of dollars?
Todd W:
Oddly enough, no her oncologist doesn't a massive case management fee. We get charged for labs & drug administration (1 time per visit), physician consultation, (one every other chemo cycle) and PA consultation ( every other chemo cycle). Once she meets the out-of-pocket max for the year there's no charge.
Ok, if you're lucky enough to be covered by health insurance,and you're expenses are reduced for chemo treatment,which if you're being honest,don't do a whole lot for people in most cases,doesn't mean somebody isn't paying for it.As pharma co's & Insurance co's each make big profits,obviously everybody else with insurance share the costs.
But with premiums rising in cost every year,because these mega corps want more & more profits,a lot of people are being squeezed out from being able to afford insurance.
Obviously I'm no doctor & wouldn't know the first thing about clinical trials,research & how a treatment for cancer is decided upon.
But it seems to me,all the cancer councils of the world & all the hospital research that's been done,haven't made much of an impact on coming close to a cure.
I understand clinical trials need to be extensive & thorough,that they are extremely expensive & take years to come to a conclusion,I have also read a study that says there are ways to manipulate the outcome of these trials.When pharma co's are paying millions for these trials that need absolute scientific proof they have a benefit as a treatment,how is it possible that pharma co's have been fined for selling drugs that don't work,and have killed people?
I understand most of you on here don't like what people like Burzynski do,mainly because of the lack of "proven" clinical trial findings,fair enough,but haven't pharma co's tried buying his patents ?set him up to fail in clinical trials? or via govt, made it so any patient he can treat is so sick from cancer & the required chemo & radiation that he can't do much.
I would just like to read something on here about an accepted treatment from the main players in this lucrative business of manufacturing & selling drugs (for any illness or disease)
that you know don't really work.Surely you know of something that doesn't or didn't work ?
If a pharma co is willing to manipulate clinical trials once for profit,surely it's possible they could do it again,considering that the fines they get for breaches don't come close to the profit they made on selling the drug.
I don't know if you people,in all your different fields of expertise, realise how arrogant you come across when you shoot down so called quacks
For educated professionals,that have to admit there is so much in this world we don't know & probably never will,it must be so damn frustrating blindly believing in the religion of science & it being the only trusted source of knowledge.
I mean how many times have you had a "scientific proof"
That turned out to be in fact,WRONG.
Someone be big enough to admit you believed in a well held scientific belief that turned out to be wrong.
Lastly,just because your beloved "science" can't prove something,because it,or human beings,aren't capable,keep an open mind to everything.
A lot of smart people cannot admit they are wrong about a belief they have ,or something they have been taught.
That's ego.
No room in science for ego
Ronnie:
There‚Äôs a lot to address in your response, but at least you came back by - so many times the true believers in woo drive by, drop a coprolite, and never come back.
First, a little background. I am not a doctor but I have much more experience with cancer than I ever wanted. My brother was diagnosed with pancreatic cancer in 2014 and my wife was diagnosed with multiple myeloma last July.
I‚Äôd like to address several of your statements, beginning with ‚Äùchemo treatment,which you‚Äôre being honest, don‚Äôt do a whole lot for people in most cases‚Äù
This statement is really REALLY wrong. My wife‚Äôs oncologist told us that had she been diagnosed with multiple myeloma ten years ago there was no treatment available. Nothing. Now, thanks to the researchers and drug companies that you so despise, there are multiple treatment regimens available. In my wife‚Äôs case treatment options are severely restricted by kidney failure, caused by the myeloma. Many of the standard myeloma treatments are ruled out by her renal failure, but still there is a standard protocol which is working well. With any luck she will move to a maintenance chemotherapy schedule in the near future. And when this particular regimen stops working, as it inevitably will, there are two new treatments, both released in the last six months, which are appropriate for myeloma patients with renal failure. Both of these are, once again, due to the hard work of the researchers and drug companies that you despise.
But it seems to me,all the cancer councils of the world & all the hospital research that‚Äôs been done,haven‚Äôt made much of an impact on coming close to a cure.‚Äù
I think you have missed a couple of major points here. First, there is no such thing as ‚Äòa cure for cancer.‚Äô There are hundreds of types of cancer; it‚Äôs not one disease. Second, you are making an arbitrary distinction between cancer which can be cured vs cancer which cannot be cured. It‚Äôs not that simple; there are lots of shade of grey between ‚Äòincurable‚Äô and ‚Äòcurable.‚Äô Multiple myeloma is incurable. But it is treatable, right now, and the treatment options continue to expand. With any luck, in the next few years myeloma will become a chronic disease, incurable but treatable, which doesn‚Äôt significantly shorten the lifespan of those who are diagnosed with it. A cure would be nice, but we can live without one!
Take a look at this graph, showing five-year survival rates for pancreatic cancer, colon cancer and myeloma.‚Ä¶
Do you really think that no progress is being achieved??
Finally, let‚Äôs look at a simple comparison over time:
- Ten years ago, in 2006, Stanislaw Burzynski was doing stage two clinical trials.
- In 2006 myeloma researchers were doing stage two clinical trials.
- Ten years later, right now, Stanislaw Burzynski is still doing stage two clinical trials.
Over the same ten-year period a number of treatments for myeloma have moved through trials into production and survival rates are sky-rocketing
Now, let‚Äôs assume that the world is perfect, and both Dr Burzynski and myeloma researchers get their wishes granted. What would the world look like?
Myeloma would be relegated to the ranks of treatable, chronic conditions. And Dr Burzynski? He would still be doing stage two clinical trials, raking in those ‚Äòmanagement fees.‚Äô
Hi Opus,hope your loved ones are doing well.
That 5 year survival rate for those particular cancers,if I'm not mistaken,can simply be improved by early detection.
And when I stated research hasn't come close to a cure for cancer,you say there isn't a cure for cancer.
Don't you mean, there isn't a cure yet ?
I know cancer is a lot of different things,and some can be masked & kept at bay for some time on chemo,but there is a lot of cancer that it doesn't do a whole lot for.FACT.
You might be happy masking a particular cancer & not finding the cause,but millions of people don't agree
And on the topic of Burzynski,why won't insurance companies pay for his treatment?
If patients have health insurance,what is it to the insurance companies where they send a cheque for treatment?
People have the right to seek treatment from anyone they wish.
If your accepted doctor tells you to go home & prepare to die,as they can't help you anymore,would you stand in the way of that person seeking treatment from someone like Burzynski?
And in a perfect world,there isn't any need for wishes.
ATTN MI Dawn
You're (happy)statement that no reputable institution charges for clinical trials I believe is wrong.
If these trials cost millions of dollars,don't these pharma co's just get that money back when they put a product on the market ?
Just because the cost of trials comes out of their account to begin with, doesn't mean they don't recuperate that,and then some,when pricing products.
Tell me,if a person has insurance,what business is it of the insurance company where they send a cheque ?
Humans a free to seek any treatment they effing like.
Just had a quick look at a history of pharmaceutical companies getting caught doing the wrong thing.
Anybody visit this blog care to admit that yes,they are,or have in the past,been paid by a pharma company that has ever been caught doing the wrong thing?
Do you believe if a pharma company deliberately lies & deceives patients about the drugs they're selling,that some people at the company should be held more accountable?
Or do you believe fines that they're profits easily cover is sufficient punishment?
What about the relationship between the FDA & Pharma co's ?
Isn't there something seriously wrong when FDA executives end up working at a pharma co ?
Give me some balance in you're blogs ORAC,we all know how you feel about Burzynski,now give us you're thoughts on some of the wrongdoings of pharma co's,the ones we know about, better yet,the ones you know about.
It's called SCIENCEBLOGS right?
But all you talk about is all the things that you don't class as science.
Ronnie:
You asked" If patients have health insurance,what is it to the insurance companies where they send a cheque for treatment?"
The answer is very simple: Just as soon as Dr Burzynski can prove that he is providing treatment, as opposed to "treatment*" insurance companies will start reimbursing him.
Why should my insurance company spend my money on his quackery? Remember, every penny that my insurance company receives comes from subscribers like me. Every dollar wasted on quacks is a dollar less for proven treatments.
* "Treatment," in Dr B's world, means that the reduction in the patient's bank account is approximately equal to the growth in Dr B's bank account.
Buggeration. Forgot to close the blockquote.
Ronnie:
I realized that I may have assumed that you know more about the American medical/insurance system than you actually do. A couple of questions:
Do you realize that insurance companies are not required to reimburse any treatment requested by a patient?
For instance, if my wife found a treatment that involved swallowing radioactive tapeworms while leeches are applied to her chakras, do you know that there is no guarantee that she would be reimbursed?
Thanks in advance!
Give me some balance in you‚Äôre blogs ORAC,we all know how you feel about Burzynski,now give us you‚Äôre thoughts on some of the wrongdoings of pharma co‚Äôs,the ones we know about, better yet,the ones you know about.
Dude, the blog has a search option in the top right corner of the page.
@Ronnie #36: "What about the relationship between the FDA & Pharma co‚Äôs ? Isn‚Äôt there something seriously wrong when FDA executives end up working at a pharma co?"
You mean like when an FDA official such as Daniel Fabricant ends up working for the dietary supplement industry (Natural Products Association) after previously working for the same organization? If you don't believe it, check his executive profile at Bloomberg dot com.
There are so many examples of Big Pharma owning or controlling a major share in dietary supplement companies that the lines have blurred. To name a handful: Pfizer bought Emergen-C; Proctor & Gamble, partners with Teva Pharmaceutical Industries, bought New Chapter, a maker of mostly herbal supplements. Reckitt Benckiser bought Schiff Nutritional. Wyeth makes Centrum and a number of other supplements. Bayer makes One A Day supplements. GlaxoSmithKline, Novartis, and Unilever, are among other big pharmaceutical firms that also manufacture or sell dietary supplements. In Europe, Sandoz makes an extract of passionflower; not an isolated constituent of the plant.
@ Ronnie and Opus
1) Of the three cancer types in the SEER curves, only colon cancer 5-year survival can be related to earlier detection.
2) The increased 5-year survival of myeloma patients preceded approval of bortezomib by FDA. It is likely that better management of known therapies resulted in this improvement.
It is sadly true that the cost of clinical trials is such that only new profitable drugs can be evaluated, while it is crucial to search for better strategies.
Ronnie -
My sister had Synovial Sarcoma in her foot 25 or so years ago, and she is still alive. Early detection had nothing to do with it, as it is a rare cancer, and she had some real MDs tell her it was nothing to worry about. She and I don't blame them, they were expecting horses, not zebras.
But one doctor said 'let's look closer' and after sending tissue samples across the country, zebras were found. One surgery later, she was cured, and the cancer was removed, and has not returned.
To this day, she is enjoying her retired life spoiling her grandchildren.
Real science, and real medicine, saved her. A lot of quack's patients die too soon and in pain. I hope that you never have cancer. But if you do, please go to see Stan.
Dear Ronnie,
I'm in the UK. Very substantial amounts of cancer research are funded by either Government (through the Medical Research Council) and through charities. Cancer treatment (like all medical treatment) is free at the point of care, although of course you can pay for it privately if you want. Charities, Government, medical practitioners and patients all have strong vested financial interests in curing cancer. Yet the evidence based protocols for treating cancer are very much the same as those in the U.S. To me, this seems to confirm that there is not a massive financial conspiracy to prevent cancer cures from becoming public. What's your view?
Of course, I fully agree that big pharmaceutical companies, and big alternative medicine companies, act in their own financial interest. This is called 'capitalism', and many Americans seem quite keen on it.
Ronnie: "I don‚Äôt know if you people,in all your different fields of expertise, realise how arrogant you come across when you shoot down so called quacks"
Ronnie: "Anybody visit this blog care to admit that yes,they are,or have in the past,been paid by a pharma company that has ever been caught doing the wrong thing?"
Ronnie, do you any idea how offensive and foolish you sound when trying to tar posters here with shill accusations?
No one here has insinuated that you're on the payroll of Burzynski or supplement companies. Your claims can be readily countered without resorting to personal attacks.
I am not now, nor have I ever been, paid by a pharma company.
Claiming that because there aren't cures for all cancers, there is "no cure for cancer" is technically true, but it's like claiming that because there aren't cures for all cancers, there is "no cure for disease." There is no general cure for disease, but there are cures for quite a few diseases, including some cancers.
Back in High School I believed in the Rutherford model of the atom. I learned better, but never felt the concept of Trigonoides and Tetragonoides had any validity.
Now, where is the evidence that Burzynski's treatments are more effective than current standard of care for various cancers?
@ Allo V Psycho
There is no conspiracy to prevent cancer cures from becoming public, but you cannot make all the preclinical studies and the big clinical trials without expectation of financial return. This is the main limitation.
Hi, Ronnie. I am not now, nor have I ever in my life been paid by ANY pharmaceutical company. So quit with the "pharma shill" talk.
I do work for health insurance. Because we 1) care about our members' health and 2) care about our members' money, we don't pay for investigational or experimental services. If Burzynski ever finished his clinical trials over the past 30 years, and actually proved his treatment works, it would be paid for. Not paying for Burzynski is like not paying for you to get your chakras aligned. Not proven treatment. Get proof it works, we'll pay. Honest. In the 15 years I've been there, I can name several treatments that were investigational when I started which now are standard of care and we pay for them. And yes, they cost a lot of money in some instances. But they have been proven to work . That's the piece missing: PROOF.
And yes, they cost a lot of money in some instances. But they have been proven to work .
Case in point: Jimmy Carter has now outlived inoperable cancer, and remains on track for outliving the guinea worm.
He's not just "still doing stage two clinical trials." As I understand it, he's still doing the same stage two clinical trials.
LW @ #53:
Is it safe to say that Stanislaw Burzynski is still inventing a triangular wheel??
I am not, nor have I ever been, paid by a pharmaceutical company, drug company or any other variant thereof for commenting, recommending or disparaging any product.

Maybe even her grandkids could benefit from some ,if they're ever in any kind of pain.

Real science,Real medication?
Imagine you're sister was in pain in the past and died from taking a "real medication" as you call it,then dropped dead,I don't think then you would have the same totally trusting attitude,towards you're big pharma crims.
VIOXX
clinical trial - tick
Ok,let's discuss a different clinically approved drug,every day,then talk about the people that died from that clinically approved drug & their family members who suffer a grief to this day because of
1) lying,deceiving pharma co's
2)Complicit,unethical,spineless,first do no harm doctors.
Shall we ?
Didn't think so
Ronnie - give us one example where Big Pharma greed killed someone with a clinically tested and approved drug.
Just one.
And I don't mean when the person died because of the underlying disease (so no, you can't bring up chemotherapy for example), nor someone who OD on (for example) pain killers as means of suicide.
@ amethyst
@ Amethyst
Ronnie already gave us one: Vioxx.
Granted, it was more the commercial branch of Merck than the scientific one which screwed up by downplaying side-effects concerns, out of zeal to sell the drug. But that fit.
There is also the old infamous Thalidomide. Thanks to a FDA suspicious woman, Frances Kelsey, it was not approved in the US.
But it was in Europe, where it ruined a few lives. And the poor Kelsey certainly took a lot of flak for daring to stand between the pharma company and the American market. So "approved", "greed" and "hurt patients" would fit this story, too.
Then there is Daniel Corcos' example, the Mediator. Very infamous in France.
The thing is,Big pharma co's have only one objective,maximum profits.
We know this,therefore they are predictable in everything they do.
Doctors & scientific researchers I thought had no such aspirations.
I truly thought their principles & ethics were non negotiable.
That they,if there is such a thing,were our real heroes.
Not seeking fame or fortune,just quietly going about the business of saving lives.
I'm sure there are some that are doing just that,but I know there are others that just can't get enough of that big pharma teet.
Maybe I was naive in thinking most doctors are a special kind of person who you really could trust with your life,
Maybe everybody does have a price.
Funny, in all those examples I am seeing all the safeguards put in place actively working as they should and stepping in to stop sales/distribution of the drug. Kelsey was a goddamn hero..
Which is the result I already knew I was going to get. Tell me Ronnie - why hasn't Big Pharma overlords used it's Iluminati-like influence and power to stop the FDA and such to stop interfering with their nefarious plans of selling death?
"The thing is,Big pharma co‚Äôs have only one objective,maximum profits."
And you should be damn glad they have that goal. Very little research for the cure of cancer, AIDS/HIV and other nasty stuff would get funded were it not for the enormous profits such cures would reap.
That you are naive enough to believe that "real scientists" work solely for the greater good at no cost is not a valid argument against anything.
@ Ronnie
Doctors & scientific researchers are human beings like anyone else around you. Don't make gods out of them, but don't deny them some right to seek personal achievements.
Academic researchers' career is based on fame, obtained through publishing their findings. The good thing is, it cuts both way in regard to outside temptations: showing that something is harmful will gather as much fame as using this something to cure some disease. Maybe more, even.
Researchers are looking for recognition. It's how good research is being propagated and improved upon. It's part of the job.
And like with anything, among all of us, some are incompetents and some are cheaters.
Don't ascribe to malice that could be just lazy wishful thinking.
When we think we have a solution to some problem, it's very easy to disregard potential issues with this solution. That's what make players of games of chance throwing good money after bad money.
It's actually a worse situation than really having corrupted people: everybody on both sides think they are the side being honest.
The true is, everybody is dishonest. Simply, they are not on the same side.
@ Amethyst
Yes.
But which part of "approved in Europe" did you not understand?
@ Ronnie
I think Big Quack, including dr. Burzynski, is far more greedy than Big Pharma.
Your dr. Burzynski is selling unaproved drugs, that don't help, for big prices and the same goes for all other cancer-quacks and if the patient isn't cured it is only the fault of the patient, but never of the quack method.
@ Renate
If there was any doubt, I will definitively put Dr Burzynski in the "cheater" category I mentioned above. 40 years and counting, and not a single valid scientific article to his name on his "cures".
Ditto as an example of a doctor into money/fame-hunting.
Eh. Thalidomide was case that thrived not so much on greed and unethical behavior as it was a mistake that happened due to the scientific limitations/ignorance of the time (it was not tested for side-effects on the unborn because it was not believed that drugs would pass the placental barrier). It was only tested and approved for the mother and from what I can tell it did no harm to her.
However, that is not to say that it wasn't challenged in Europe at the time: both a German and Austrian scientist at the time did publish theories about it. Nor did the drug get fully endorsed in all of Europe; several countries heavily restricted it or didn't approve it at all.
But yes, it was technically a clinically approved (by the shitty standards of the time) drug that wrecked havoc - I'll grant you that.
@ Helianthus
I think that is exactly what I said.
@ Renate
My apologies, I was not criticizing your post.
I go back at lurking.
@ amethyst
There is nothing that can be said in defence of Benfluorex. They cheated about the mode of action (they did not say it was an anorectic agent) and the lethal side effects could have been predicted from their previous drug, fenfluramine.
Why do you assume I would defend it..? I am curious however - do we really know it was malice on the part of the ones who made/sold it,or negligence on their part or some sort of French regulatory organ?
I'd say some blame can be at whatever the French equivalent of the FDA is called. From what I can tell, the drug has been around since the '70s - which is terrifying to say the least.
@ Amethyst
No, I did not assume that you would defend it. What I meant was that it was a much stronger case of deliberate misinformation than the other examples. First, it was sold as antidiabetic agent, but the mode of action was as an anorectic agent, for which it should not have been authorized in this indication. Second, similar pathologies were observed with a related molecule which had to be withdrawn. Although it had no obvious therapeutic interest, the drug was covered by the national insurance system. This means political connections and conflict of interests.
Ronnie @57
Even the Vioxx story is not as black-and-white as media accounts make it out to be. Every drug which is pharmacologically active usually has side-effects, and it's almost always a matter of balancing risks against benefits. Drugs very similar to vioxx are legally prescribed in Europe : in fact a few years ago I was prescribed one (arcoxia) for disabling back pain. Reading the list of potential side-effects on the leaflet in the drug box made my hair stand on end, but .... the drug did the trick, after five months of other ineffective treatments. Once I was fine again, the doc. was quick to tell me to stop taking the drug.
Reading the wiki on Vioxx, I get the impression that if Merck hadn't been so shifty about the data on it from the beginning, it might still be on the market under that name.
Apart from having taken the drug, I have no links with the manufacturer.
Ronnie,
If you really want to discuss badly done science to promote a commercial end, you might want to check out.
Before you go, though, you wrote above
Before anyone does that, don't you think it would be useful to know the success rates of both? The success rates (as measured by survival) for conventional cancer treatments are published. Where are Burzynski‚Äôs?
Please do a price comparison on Burzynski‚Äôs cancer treatment & your accepted cancer treatment
That's one of the arguments I frequently see for homeopathy. News flash: something that is cheap but has never been proved to work, is no bargain.
shay simmons @ #75:
I believe your comment is off-topic. The issue at hand is a treatment that is expensive and doesn't work.
(snark off)
You mean Burzynski isn't treating people out of the goodness of his heart? I'm shocked, I tell you. Shocked.
ATTN AMETHYST #62
you mentioned that I should be glad big pharma co's are only interested in maximum profits,because as you said,
"Very little research for these cures would be funded if it wasn't for the enormous profits a CURE would reap.
Um.....Isn't big pharma already making enormous profits ?
I don't think you understand what you have written,you're admitting big pharma will not fund a research that could CURE a cancer,AIDS/HIV or other nasty,unless they can profit ENORMOUSLY.
So if a natural element was found to show unbelievable promise as a CURE for cancer that couldn't be patented,
You believe that big pharma wouldn't fund trials,because of no chance of those ENORMOUS profits.
I totally agree.
CURE.... PROFIT.
When I say these two words out loud together
I feel sick.
Hey Amethyst,I can't say that I would be glad a child suffering a cancer,that was soon going to kill them,only because that child's family couldn't afford the newly discovered CURE that,as you say,will be sold for ENORMOUS profits.
Will you be glad ?
Cure,profit,then what for big pharma ?
After ending all disease & illness forever,& nobody having to buy their drugs ever again,maybe they will just take a bow & never be heard of again.
Hey Amethyst,just wondering,if you worked for a pharma co that discovered a cure for a cancer & were responsible for coming up with a price charged to each patient,how ENORMOUS a fee could be charged ?
You are one disgusting thing.
I hope you can afford the fee if you get cancer,if not,don't pack a lot of clothes when you leave here,because where your headed gets extremely hot.
I'm just going to ignore all the personal attacks and be the bigger Gem.
That being said, you need to wake up. As I said before, you live in some kind of fantasy where "real scientists" only work for the betterment of mankind, free of charge. The fact of the matter is that both scientist and medical doctor is a job to pay one's bills.
It sure would be nice if we lived in the StarTrek universe where currency and economics have long since been abolished and everyone just works to better themselves and their professional field of choice, but we don't.
"So if a natural element was found to show unbelievable promise as a CURE for cancer that couldn‚Äôt be patented."
Natural elements can be patented. You realize that a lot of common medicine is derived from "natural elements" such as plants? Asprin is derived from willow tree bark, for example. If a certain plant was shown to contain the cure for cancer, you can bet your sweet ass on the discoverer being able to patent it!
"I don‚Äôt think you understand what you have written,you‚Äôre admitting big pharma will not fund a research that could CURE a cancer,AIDS/HIV or other nasty,unless they can profit ENORMOUSLY."
"Big Pharma" is not a charity. Again with your delusion that all science should be done on a purely altruistic, non-profit basis... That being said, cancer and AIDS/HIV research is going on in full swing so obviously "Big Pharma" are quite confident in the profits of a cure. Plus there are non-"Big Pharma" researchers working on it.
"Hey Amethyst,I can‚Äôt say that I would be glad a child suffering a cancer,that was soon going to kill them,only because that child‚Äôs family couldn‚Äôt afford the newly discovered CURE that,as you say,will be sold for ENORMOUS profits."
I can only assume you are speaking from an American perspective, because in the glorious socialist state/hellhole where I live, that doesn't happen. That is a problem with America's healtcare and insurance system.
"Hey Amethyst,just wondering,if you worked for a pharma co that discovered a cure for a cancer & were responsible for coming up with a price charged to each patient,how ENORMOUS a fee could be charged ?"
See my previous point.
"I hope you can afford the fee if you get cancer,if not,don‚Äôt pack a lot of clothes when you leave here,because where your headed gets extremely hot."
I got good medical insurance, thank you very much. And even if I hadn't, again I live in socialist hell so I wouldn't have to pay a lot out of my own pockets.
Oh and there is no God nor Hell. So you'll forgive me for not giving a rat's ass about your threat of eternal hellfire. :)
Ronnie ignores the fact, that regardless of who does it (government, educational or corporate), research into new drug development is extremely expensive and time-consuming.
And the old "natural" fallacy - as any natural cure or substance would still need to be researched, refined and replicated for any real treatment....
Not to mention that it would still go through the years of clinical trials to ensure both safety and efficacy. These organizations are also still made up of people, people who's families probably experience Cancer, AIDS, etc - so the thought that they would be part of any "cover-up" is just ludicrous.
I love it when the quacks try to sound logical, when they are anything but.
@ronnie
You do know using the pharmashill gambit shows just how lacking your so called "argument" really is.
And while we are at it, how can we tell that you are not a shill for burzynski?
Hey Lawrence ya dropshort,why would a fruit or a vegetable, or even if it was a fish that was recently discovered,as having unbelievable healing powers, why would any of these tings need to be replicated ?
You can't replicate Mother nature
Just answer these question
How much do you think a pharma company if they had it patented, would charge for a CURE of any type of cancer ?
You pick one & give me a price.
Then obviously the floodgates open & everything is cured
No more disease or illness.
Just imagine it were possible,what kind of price tags would your big pharma co's be putting on the average cure
If you honestly think CURES are the objective,it's you that is illogical.
Why the hell would they want no more repeat business ?
And you ask if people in the industry would be a part of the cover up if they had sick loved ones ?
The thing is,you all have special little jobs in certain fields,& it's a good bet most of you haven't got any idea about anything.
A handful of brilliant minds carrying a bunch of morons.
That's all kinds of science really.
@Novalox
Gee you didn't get to specific with that post,what exactly was my argument lacking ?
My thoughts that enormous profits shouldnt be made on a cure for a cancer ? You obviously do.
Having a child die because their family can't afford the price tag for the cure,is a tragedy. you obviously don't agree.
Or was it when I pointed out that AMETHYST actually agrees with me,why else would AMETHYST state big pharma co's are not interested in a cure unless they can make ENORMOUS profits ?
That is my argument,
I won the argument Novalox.The only thing lacking here is your heart.
Why don't you enlighten me to why Enormous profits for a cure is reasonable ?and why a child dying because their family can't afford Enormous fee is reasonable ?
A child dying because of profit.
But the thought of that happening,I bet,just makes you yawn.
ATTN AMETHYST
So where you live in you're socialist hellhole,you really think if a cure was discovered that your insurance company would pay the pharma company for it ?
Out of their own pocket ?
I'm confused,
Would pharma co's charge Enormous fees for the cure or not ?
That is what you said earlier.
You can't have it both ways.
Either it's covered by insurance,therefore you have no need for medical insurance anymore (maybe just cheap accidental insurance or something)& you have no need for big pharma,
Not to mention hospitals,no longer charging their outrageous fees,and who could forget all those medical researchers,don't need therm either.
If the cost of a cure is enormous,you & most others will die,because insurance co's won't cover you.
If cost of cure is cheap & your covered,
Big pharma,health insurers,hospital & researchers are no longer required for the most part.
No logically thinking person can believe a cure for all those terrible cancers etc,is what they truly want.
If you can't see that,you can't be reasoned with,& I actually feel sorry for you
For those here that disagree,is it because you believe in the kindness of big pharma or what ?
Think of it this way people,totally the opposite of a cure.
A product that causes cancer.
Manufacturers deny its deadly,but in fact it is.
Not only does government not ban the sale of product after proven causes cancer
but are profiting from the death of its citizens hopelessly addicted to product.
Tell me one govt in the world that has banned the sale of cigarettes ?
If those in power can ban something that kills people,but don't
Why on earth would those in power make available a cure (s)
that would make them redundant
As u said AMETHYST,doctors have bills to pay as well.
See I told you,you keep making my argument for me
"So where you live in you‚Äôre socialist hellhole,you really think if a cure was discovered that your insurance company would pay the pharma company for it."
Y...you do know how insurance, works, right?
"Would pharma co‚Äôs charge Enormous fees for the cure or not ?"
You can't seriously be this stupid... When I said there is the potential of massive profit to be found in a cure for cancer, I was not talking about them charging millions of dollars per patient/dose but rather how people everywhere, regardless of nationality, can get cancer. It is one thing all humans have in common it is cancer. Even a reasonably priced cure would, through sheer sales numbers, be worth it for a pharmacutical company.
"If the cost of a cure is enormous,you & most others will die,because insurance co‚Äôs won‚Äôt cover you."
Bull. Shit. Insurance companies regularly pay out incredibly costly treatments and drugs already. Again, you don't seem to know anything about it whatsoever.
"you can‚Äôt be reasoned with,& I actually feel sorry for you"
I...I think I just had an irony stroke or something. Before I literally die by continuing this discussion, let me ask you this: what makes cancer so special in your mind? There are plenty of other diseases that we've in the past developed cures for. If your "treatment is more profitable than cure"-gambit is true, that makes absolutely no sense.
@Ronnie the Duck: If you can't write in complete sentences and proper words, don't come to a science forum and try to educate those with more learning than you. You have *no* idea about cancer, treatment, or causes.
Science has been able to cure many cancers, through surgery/chemotherapy/radiation therapy. Sometimes surgery alone cures. Sometimes chemotherapy or radiation therapy alone cure. Sometimes you need all 2 of the 3.
Besides, isn't Burzynski making millions off the poor suckers who come to him? Why don't you attack him? He lies, charges far more for the medications he sells in his pharmacy than a regular pharmacy would charge for the exact same medication and tells people he's not giving them chemotherapy when he is.
You apparently want to go back to the golden era of dying horrible deaths at early ages from disease, leukemia, and childbirth. Go ahead. The rest of us will stay here and enjoy the products of science.
Aye, there is no bigger hypocrisy than a Burzynski devotee summoning the Pharma Shill-boogeyman...
Well, I would say that if a company did find the "cure" for Cancer & attempted to charge exorbitant amounts of money for it, there would be a good chance that the government (or several) would take steps to take possession of this cure (or just pay the company handsomely for it) and literally give it away.
Imagine the massive amounts of money that just about every government on earth would save (since most of them have universal health care systems) if Cancer was eliminated.
Again, use from freakin' common sense - because you are really coming off as a complete idiot.
Why the hell would they want no more repeat business ?
I never understand this twisted logic from conspiracy kooks: even if every single person on the face of the earth with cancer was cured tonight, by this time tomorrow there would be an entirely new crop of people diagnosed and looking for a cure. There might not be repeat business, but there would be a never ending supply of new business. If Big Pharma had "a cure" (sic), it could charge whatever it wanted and there would be a limitless pool of customers lining up. Forever.
Ronnie, you ignorant slut:
There's a miracle substance that has recently been developed that will prevent most cases of cancer of the cervix, vulva, anus and oropharynx. It is relatively cheap, very safe and easy to take. This would result in a significant reduction in cases of cancer and precancer, and the need to treat these conditions. Obviously, it's unavailable because those in power have suppressed it to preserve their bottom line.
Oh wait, it's freely available. It's called Gardasil, you dimwit.
ATTN MI DAWN
Who cares about proper constructed sentences,you moron.
Cutting a certain kind of cancer out of a certain kind of patient,and it not returning isn't a cure,it's luck.
I could fracking do that.
You say I don't know what causes cancer,so tell me what causes brain tumours ?
You think you have more learning than me ?
The only thing you fools know is chemo,surgery,radiation.
It's a joke.
@Woo fighter is the only one that gets my respect,as it's true new cases will still require the treatment to cure them.
That word ....forever,makes me think.
It's the cancers that can be beaten,because the cause has been found,that will make all the difference in the world.But I've never read one thing on here regarding prevention.
And that's because you Educated marvels with more "learning" than me,know nothing,
ATTN Lwrence
Governments will buy cure off pharma co & give it away for free
Because savings on health care.
Ok ,so why don't those same governments ban cancer causing cigarette if that's your belief ??
Please,someone with more learning than me answer that question
That got me thinking, Bruce - why aren't boys given it too? I mean, they may not have the former "bits" but they do have the latter.
@Ronnie:
"Ok ,so why don‚Äôt those same governments ban cancer causing cigarette if that‚Äôs your belief ??"
Because freedom. Though, admittedly I find it kinda strange to sell something so addictive as smokes under the guise of freedom since there is very little freedom of choice involved in addiction. I also find it kinda strange that we're not allowing weed and such under the same flag, but whatever - that's beside the point.
That being said, while not outright banning smokes, governments world-wide do heavily discourage the practice. Smokes are taxed like crazy, and the health risks are both known and advertised. Again, because I live in a socialist heaven/hell, my government is offering free support groups for people who are trying to quit smoking (because no doubt the cost of smoking-related diseases far outweigh the cost of running a support group like that).
Polite people who try to do their best to communicate to others?
Who cares about proper constructed sentences
Generally the same people who care about properly constructed thoughts.
Wait, is this a return to the truly ancient antineoplastinoid-deficiency routine, or are you unable to write?
Some cancers can be caused by viruses. One example is the human papillomavirus, which has been associated with uterine, penile, and other cancers. There is a vaccine for HPV that Orac has written about frequently.
I'll also throw in that many cancers are associated with exposure to certain chemicals, fine dusts, or radioactive substances. If at all practical, reduce your exposure to those substances if you want to avoid cancer. This is no guarantee, and it may not be practical to avoid all of those.
Ronnie:
A couple of questions regarding the payments from 'Big Pharma:'
- Since this is a worldwide conspiracy, who manages the database to track which 'shills' get paid how much? Where is the data center located?
- How are the currency conversion transactions hidden?
- How do the Pharma Overlords locate and pay 'shills' who blog under a pseudonym?
- Are the payments taxable income? Earned income or another type of income? How are they reported to federal/national revenue agencies?
- Where are the payments hidden in company financial records? Since my wife has multiple myeloma and is treated with Velcade, please point out the line on the Takeda Corporation's consolidated financial statement for 2015 where payments to Velcade 'shills' are shown, as well as the costs of managing these payments.
- The Physician Payments Sunshine Act requires that all payments to physicians be posted to a federal database. Where are Orac's payments shown?
- All federal contracts are listed on a database. Where is Orac's contract for 'shilling' listed?
- Payments to shills in certain countries are prohibited by federal law. How are these handled?
I am sure I'll have some follow-up questionss but please enlighten us - given your expertise I'm sure these questions can be answered in a flash!
@ Mephistopheles O'Brien
Indeed. Living underground will help to avoid our sun's UV radiation - and other, more energetic rays. Thus minimizing exposure to a highly contributing factor to skin cancers. But then, by doing so, you will forfeit the benefits of sun exposure, like synthesis of vitamin D.
Oxygen is a big source of oxidative stress in our tissues. But it is very unpractical to try avoiding breathing.
A bit more seriously, I'm afraid the general consensus on cancer prevention comes down to the usual: more vegetables, less meat, a varied diet, not too much spices, definitively no smoking, and do some exercise.
In the archives here and in Orac's other blog, people have written numerous times on the results of studies on cancer prevention. Unfortunately, most of the times the results are on the line of "that may help, a bit" (e.g. high-fiber diet), or "that didn't look like that did any good" (e.g. increased intake of vitamins and anti-free radicals).
Putting on some sunscreen is definitively on the "helping" list, though. And recently, to belabor the point, anti-HPV and anti-hepB vaccines have joined this list.
Not a general consensus, but I would say that if you are a DNA repair mutation carrier, better avoid mammography.

The CDC recommends giving an HPV vaccine series to all children at 11 or 12 years of age. The FDA approved it for use in boys back in 2010.
I have to say that I'm impressed. Ronnie is doing much better at trolling than he/she has ever done with previous 'nyms.
@Amethyst:
Yes, as SteveJ says, the HPV vaccine is recommended for boys as well.
I also forgot to mention cancer of the penis. Probably because I want to avoid thinking about the treatment (penectomy).

So can patients benefit from burzinski's antineoplastons,or is he a quack ?

CONTRADICTIVE.

How many times has burzinski beaten TMB & FDA in court ?
It's unheard of.
So the FDA will spend millions of dollars(trying) to stop burzinski treating patients with something that works on a bigger percentage of patients than anything else
Haven't you fools listened to his patients ?
Of course you haven't because you know it all.
Burzinski has had people testify in court regarding antineoplastons that have a lot more knowledge than you retards,

NBC‚Äôs Ben Collins: Because of algorithm suggestions on tech platforms, people ‚Äúgo down rabbit holes‚Äù and ‚Äúmaybe they start as racists and they end up as extremists"
Published
Discussing the shooting at two New Zealand mosques that left at least 49 dead at the hands of an anti-Muslim extremist, NBC reporter Ben Collins noted that the alleged shooter showed signs of ‚Äúgetting radicalized by these same algorithms‚Äù on tech platforms such as YouTube that previously influenced other mass shooters.
YouTube has a serious radicalization problem because its algorithm sometimes pushes far-right content via recommendations, which Collins noted can cause people to ‚Äúgo down rabbit holes‚Äù and ‚Äúmaybe they start as racists and they end up as extremists,‚Äù leading to harassment, racist violence, and terrorism. Collins also compared the alleged Christchurch shooter‚Äôs reported announcement of the attack on far-right message board 8chan to the alleged Pittsburgh, PA, shooter‚Äôs announcement of his attack on Gab, a social media platform that is a hotbed for white nationalists.
The alleged New Zealand mosque shooter livestreamed the attack on Facebook, and it was also shared on YouTube and Twitter, but the social media platforms have struggled to remove the video. Tech companies have been ill-equipped to proactively deal with this kind of content, in some ways leaving the task of combating it to the most affected communities.
Collins said that the tech platforms ‚Äúcan stop this‚Äù and prevent such radicalization in advance, noting that they have effectively fought ISIS content but have treated far-right extremist content as ‚Äúa political issue that it really isn't,‚Äù presenting it as political speech rather than a gateway to terrorism.
From the March 15 edition of MSNBC Live with Stephanie Ruhle:
STEPHANIE RUHLE (HOST): Ben, the white nationalist manifesto that was posted online before the attacks, you say there are a couple of things that ring obvious bells. And we need to remind our audience, whenever people say, ‚ÄúA nationalist is the same thing as a patriot,‚Äù no, it's not.
BEN COLLINS: Right, so he was a white nationalist. That‚Äôs what he was. And we mean that in the sense that he only wanted white people in his nation. That‚Äôs what white nationalism means.
RUHLE: Yeah.
COLLINS: For a lot of these people -- I think a lot of people try to defang that word and say, ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not as bad as white supremacist,‚Äù right? Well how are you going to get only white people in a nation? This is how you do it, to these people. The entire manifesto is about this. And of course, like, there is trolling in there, right? There is stuff in there -- because he was so reared online.
RUHLE: How -- tell us, because not everyone has seen this. What do you mean there was trolling in there? How? Where?
COLLINS: Right, so he posted this manifesto on this thing called 8chan, which is -- you may have heard of 4chan. It is double 4chan in every way. It‚Äôs an extremist website, effectively, where anonymous people are allowed to post whatever they want. He was actually cheered on after he posted this thing. And it‚Äôs -- this is the blind spot that you're talking about, right, where this stuff isn‚Äôt monitored with the same sort of rigor and it‚Äôs because it's a political issue, it's become a political issue for really no reason, but these people are committing terror attacks over and over again, you know, using the same platforms, getting radicalized by these same algorithms, over and over again. And at some point these tech companies, which, like you said, when was the last time you got recommended an ISIS video on YouTube? Probably never, right?
RUHLE: Never.
COLLINS: Tech companies can do this, they can stop this, but they have made this a political issue that it really isn't.
...
RUHLE: Ben, I want to talk about this because you put a tweet out this morning where you write, ‚ÄúExtremism researchers and journalists (including me) warned the company YouTube in emails, on the phone, and to employees' faces after the last terror attack that the next one would show signs of YouTube radicalization again, but the outcome would be worse. I was literally scoffed at.‚Äù Please tell me about this.
COLLINS: Yeah, I was scoffed at by an executive at YouTube.
RUHLE: Don‚Äôt laugh. Tell me what happened.
COLLINS: Sure, yeah. Look, we have over and over again talked to these companies about -- the last time this happened, right? We were -- it was a couple of days before midterms. There was a guy who shot up a synagogue in Pittsburgh. He used the same verbiage. He said, ‚ÄúInvaders are coming, they‚Äôre coming through the caravan, and they‚Äôre backed by this Jewish cabal that‚Äôs taking over the world, trying to take out the white race,‚Äù right? So we talked to them, we talked to these tech companies, we talked to YouTube.
RUHLE: And what do they say to you?
COLLINS: They‚Äôre like, ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre working on it.‚Äù I‚Äôm like, ‚ÄúWell, are you working on it?‚Äù
RUHLE: What does that mean? So in the last 12 hours when I‚Äôm watching the news, I keep hearing reporters say, ‚ÄúAnd they‚Äôre working on taking these down.‚Äù I don‚Äôt understand the ‚Äúworking on‚Äù part.
COLLINS: Yeah. And that‚Äôs the thing. YouTube put out a statement today, they‚Äôre saying, ‚ÄúOh, we‚Äôre really working to take down the video of the shooting.‚Äù And that‚Äôs great. That‚Äôs wonderful. But it's the months before the shooting, where these people go down rabbit holes and maybe they start as racists and they end up as extremists. That‚Äôs the stuff they‚Äôre really not working on at the level they can. They do it with ISIS. Why can't we do it with this?Outreach Reading Books from Birth Bookbag Program Earth Day with The Lorax Scholarships Storybook Trail Bookmobile Book Spot

Hi , I'm looking for a service manual for the Dynatron CTV27/ 733 chassis . I know the main chassis is the same as the PYE 741 but this dose not include the sub panels for touch tune or vcr input photocopy will do as long as its readable
cheers

Mauritron claim to have it, 3 entries in the list, if no one else can help it may be worth asking what they can supply.
I've got a large amount of PYE CTV service manuals. I will have to have a trawl through them to see if the 733 data is in there. It might be some time but I will get back to you.

Hativagone, who also chairs the Zimbabwe Tourism Authority board and is Chief Executive of Codchem Investments, said the move to cut the days would help bring in investment.
Zimbabwe is among the least attractive investment destinations, according to the annual Doing Business survey coordinated by the World Bank.The Minister of Investment Promotion and International Cooperation, Tapiwa Mashakada, said ZIA now operated a one-stop shop.
The long period taken by officials to be cleared to operate in Zimbabwe has been one of the factors forcing investors to shift their attention to other countries in the region. Mashakada said the government would adopt more measures to attract and retain investment.Post published in: BusinessIn a summer when many public activities, including church services, were curtailed, Living Hope Christian Fellowship of Surrey, B.C., hosted a Vacation Bible School (VBS) program from Aug. 9 to 13. Last year, Living Hope‚Äôs VBS had only 10 children attending in person, with seven online. By contrast, this year 38 children came, all in person.
Reaching out to the community has always been a priority for Living Hope. The congregation has become increasingly multicultural, reflecting the community of Surrey/North Delta, and has a sizable Karen population. Half of this year‚Äôs attendees were community children.
VBS was held in three-hour in-person sessions daily each morning and afternoon, following COVID-19 protocols in place at the time, that did not require the wearing of masks; since then, masks have become mandatory again, following rising COVID-19 numbers in the province.
Living Hope publicized the event by sending registration forms to the local school before the school year ended and putting registration forms on the church‚Äôs front door. A sign was put outside the church advertising the day camp‚Äôs theme, dates and cost, along with mentioning that it would be hosted in person.
‚ÄúWilderness escape‚ÄîWhere God guides and provides‚Äù was the theme for VBS this year.
‚ÄúIn this theme of trusting God, we went through the story of God leading the Israelites to the Promised Land and how he was faithful in his promises to his people, and how he is that same God to us today,‚Äù says Alyssa Hordyk of the church‚Äôs children‚Äôs ministry program.
‚ÄúWe had 25 enthusiastic volunteers helping throughout the week,‚Äù she says. ‚ÄúIt is always a highlight of Living Hope‚Äôs summer. People are always so ready to pitch in and be a part of it all. I am so grateful to the Lord for his kindness and provision as we serve him in spreading the good news of Christ.‚Äù.Try our new ML powered Smart-Search!

Frequently Asked Questions About Wisconsin Cemetery Gravestones and the Krause Monument Company
What is the difference between granite and marble?
The composition of granite and marble is very different. Granite is an igneous rock that was once a molten mass called magma. Marble is created by a concentration of bones and shells of sea creatures that built up a deposit of lime. Therefore, marble is not nearly as hard as granite and will erode over the years. Granite is the preferred material to use for memorials because of its durability.
How Do I Get Information About Wisconsin Cemetery Rules and Regulations?
Click here to learn about Wisconsin cemetery and gravestone (grave markers, headstones, memorials and monuments) information, rules, regulations and guidelines including directions to Wisconsin cemeteries served by the Krause Monument Company.
How is the carving and design put on the stone?
Krause Monument Company prides itself in our manufacturing process. Our main manufacturing plant is at our Viroqua, Wisconsin facility. We employ skilled craftsmen that hand-carve special designs. Through various sandblast processes, your design is permanently engraved in your chosen color and style of stone. Our craftsmen can duplicate any existing design or create a new personalized design made especially for your family.
If I want a special design, can you do it?
We pride ourselves in our ability to personalize each and every memorial. When you sit down with one of our design specialists, they will help you design a very meaningful and personal memorial. We have thousands of design options to chose from, or we can accommodate your special requests.
Do you stand behind your work?
Krause Monument Company guarantees the work we do for you. Please see our Unconditional Guarantee that we offer for all of our products and services.
Should I use years only or month, day and year?
Sometimes this decision must be made based on the amount of space that is available on your memorial with your chosen design. If there is sufficient space, then you may be more specific with information, such as month, day, and year, to offer more detailed information on the memorial. In most cases, there is no additional charge for the more detailed inscription if it is chosen at the time of purchase of the memorial.
If I run into problems at the cemetery, who should I go to for help?
In most cases, individual cemeteries are responsible for pouring the foundation for their monuments and markers to be installed there. A separate fee is collected to cover this work. We then deliver the memorial to the cemetery and set it on the foundation they provide. If there are issues with the foundation work, we will be happy to work with you and the cemetery to resolve them.
Do all cemeteries allow the same type of memorial?
Cemeteries each have their own requirements for the size and type of memorials that they will allow. We will work with you to determine what is allowed at your cemetery and what will look best on your lot. Please call us at 608-637-7726 for answers to your questions regarding cemetery regulations.
Why should I buy a memorial from Krause Monument Company instead of from the cemetery?
Krause Monument Company specializes in making memorials. We have our own manufacturing plant and do our own work. We are experts in the field, having been in business since 1895. Please review our Local Workshop page to see how a memorial is made to see a demonstration of our manufacturing process. While a cemetery may sell memorials as a sideline, it does not specialize in that product. We can provide the expertise to design an appropriate memorial for you, and we offer the most complete selection of designs and colors.
How much should I expect to pay for a memorial?
The cost of a memorial can vary significantly based on several factors. Our lawn level markers start at $500 and increase in price based on the design and color of granite that you choose. Monuments for one and two graves start at $1,300 and increase in price based on the style, size, design, and special features. Our mausoleums are very specialized, and start in price at $25,000. We encourage you to meet with one of our designers to discuss a memorial that will fit your needs and budget.
What is the difference between a hand etching and a laser etching?
Hand etchings are done by an artist who uses specialized diamond-tipped tools to create a series of tiny impressions directly in the black granite. These impressions will last forever and provide the maximum amount of clarity of an image. Laser etchings are done using a computer.Quote Form

Health Insurance 497 views January 18, 2021
Health insurance gives us financial cover against hospitalization expenses resulting from medical treatment. But falling sick regularly and making health insurance claims subsequently could wipe out the entire sum insured amount too over time. The sum insured is the total amount you could get to deal with a medical emergency. So will you be denied a health cover in case you meet with a health emergency and have already exhausted the sum insured? Maybe not if you have a restoration facility added to your health insurance policy. It‚Äôs a facility by which you can recover the sum insured you may have exhausted by claiming it earlier. But this restoration benefit is not as straightforward as it may seem! There are many delicacies associated with the ‚ÄòSum Insured Restoration Facility‚Äô that you should know to maximize. In this post, we will discuss the same. Let‚Äôs begin!
Table of Contents
The modus operandi of the restoration facility depends on the type of offer itself. While some health insurance companies allow you to restore only after you exhaust the entire sum insured including the no claim bonus amount, others can provide this facility even if you have utilized the sum insured partially. Besides, the restoration benefit applies to different illnesses and is available only for one policy year. It means the restoration won‚Äôt get carried from one year to another, much unlike the no claim bonus where the sum insured rises on renewal by not claiming in a year.
Note ‚Äì The general working of Restoration Benefit is explained above. However, health insurance companies can make changes to it.
Health insurance plans come in both individual and family floater basis. As the name suggests, individual plans will cover the particular individual only and not their dependents. This is where a family floater plan can come in handy by covering both. And with more members in the policy, the chances of exhausting the sum insured are greater. So with a restoration facility, you won‚Äôt face the last-minute hassle of arranging money should any medical emergency arise and you don‚Äôt have any sum insured left with you.
The restoration benefit of health insurance policies acts much like an add-on, so the premium amount goes up accordingly. But you could still manage that amount pretty well as affordability varies from one individual to another. So, read policies regarding the premium amount with a restoration facility before zeroing on the right deal.
It‚Äôs only better if we know the working of restoration benefits across different health insurance policies. With that, you could figure out the best policy in terms of this benefit. So, without waiting any further, let‚Äôs check out!To change your profile picture, login to your account and on the right side of the screen you‚Äôll see options near your name.

Hence the term, 'tee box'. Brooke/Topical Press 05, 2019 In common usage, "tee box" is just another term for the teeing area (called the teeing ground prior to the 2019 rules revisions), which is the starting point on each hole of a golf course and the area covered by the space in-between two tee markers and two-club-lengths back from the tee markers. Key Takeaways "Tee box" is a vernacular term used by golfers; the term used by the governing bodies of golf (the R&A and USGA) is "teeing area."The tee box is the starting point of every hole on the golf course, the place from which golfers play the first stroke of each hole.The tee box is the space between two tee markers (set up by the golf course) and two club-lengths behind those markers. Golfers began referring to the teeing area. Like the term "teeing area" is used to refer to one specific set of tees, the phrase "tee box" is also used to refer to one specific set of tees but is also used to refer to the full complement of teeing areas on any given hole. A golf course might have three, four, five or more sets of tees of varying yardages, and often, several of those teeing areas are grouped together, wherein "tee box" refers to that grouping as well. The definition of "teeing area" that appears in the Rules of Golf (and which is generally interchangeable with "tee box," although the governing bodies use only "teeing area")." Tee Markers and Yardage One notable fact about the tee box is that golf courses often use their own tee markers to give golfers details about the course: most often courses use markers to denote the yardage of each hole, but sometimes courses will use fun tee markers to simply make golfers smile instead. Typically, championship matches use a standard black or gold tee marker at each tee box, but outside of championship play, courses also use white markers to denote the "men's tees," which are most often used by middle or high handicap players. Red markers can mean different things depending on whether or not they're in front of or behind white markers: behind white markers, red markets denote championship play, and in front of white markers, red markers are often referred to as "women's tees" and offer the shortest yardage on the course. Green markers usually denote both the starting point for beginners and junior players and a shorter yardage than even the red markers. Alternatively, green markers can be used to denote senior tees, but so can gold or yellow (when gold is not being used for championship play). This position offers the same yardage as the green markers. In short, a golf course can use any colors it wants for its tee markers. The key is that the specific tee box you use on the first hole (for example, the white tees) is the one you'll use throughout the round.

Shares in the fake meat company co-owned by Bill Gates, Beyond Meat, have plummeted as growing numbers of consumers reject bioengineered ‚Äúfood.‚Äù
Despite an ongoing push from the global elite ‚Äì who unlikely consume the stuff themselves but insist that you eat nothing else, demand for lab-grown ‚Äúmeat‚Äù has slowed far beyond shareholders‚Äô predictions.
On Wednesday, Beyond Meat Inc (BYND.O) forecast fourth-quarter revenue below estimates.
The move came as the once red-hot plant-based ‚Äúmeat‚Äù producer reported slowing demand in both grocery stores and restaurants.
The news ended up driving the company‚Äôs shares down by a whopping 19 percent in extended trading.
The company, which generates the bulk of its revenue from retailers, had cut its third-quarter revenue forecast last month.
The company reported taking a hit from fewer people stockpiling plant-based burgers and sausages at home after they returned to dining out.B.S., Communication Engineering, Civil Aviation University of China, Tianjin, China

That‚Äôs not quite how CBS News saw it though. According to anchor Gayle King on Tuesday, the riots began as ‚Äúpeaceful protests, which is what the Black Lives Matter is really about.‚Äù
‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not clear if those setting fires were involved in the initial demonstrations,‚Äù King said. Yet as she described Black Lives Matter‚Äôs supposedly peaceful methods, CBS played scenes of vehicles engulfed by fire, crowds jumping on cars, and businesses still smoldering from the night‚Äôs anarchy.
According to King, the protests spontaneously ‚Äúgave way to clashes‚Äù as night fell. Reporter Mola Lenghi further appeared to excuse the destruction, telling viewers that ‚Äúsetting this truck on fire right here behind me is how some protesters have responded to the authorities‚Äô use of stun grenades, [and] of tear gas.‚Äù
By Tuesday morning, hours of video footage from Kenosha circulated online, showing that the protests were anything but peaceful.

CBS instead focused on the event that triggered the riots ‚Äì the police shooting of 29-year-old Jacob Blake on Sunday. Blake was shot in the back seven times by officers as he attempted to get into his car, collapsing in front of his children. His father told the Chicago Sun-Times that Blake is now paralyzed from the waist down.Also on rt.com Documents show Jacob Blake, shot by Kenosha cops in riot-unleashing incident, has record of domestic abuse
The network wasn‚Äôt alone in whitewashing the riots. The New York Times also described Monday‚Äôs events as ‚Äúpeaceful marches‚Äù that ‚Äúgave way to fires and destruction.‚Äù On CNN, a banner described the protests as ‚Äúfiery but mostly peaceful.‚Äù
The latest conflagration in Kenosha isn‚Äôt the first riot to be given the ‚Äúpeaceful protests‚Äù treatment by the media. As the first wave of Black Lives Matter protests hit Minneapolis in May after the police killing of George Floyd, MSNBC‚Äôs Ali Veshi reassured viewers that the scene was ‚Äúnot generally speaking, unruly.‚Äù As Veshi spoke, a building burned immediately behind him.
When anarchists occupied Seattle‚Äôs Capitol Hill district two weeks later, the Seattle Times described the short-lived ‚ÄòCapitol Hill Autonomous Zone‚Äô as a ‚Äúloose, egalitarian‚Äù paradise of ‚Äúfree snacks,‚Äù ‚Äúfree of uniformed police.‚Äù In reality, the zone was a lawless place, where vigilante justice reigned, thieves profited, and by the end of June, four people were shot, two fatally.
The disconnect between narrative and reality was noticed on Twitter, where conservatives mocked CBS‚Äô friendly coverage of the Kenosha riots. ‚ÄúYou could describe D Day as a peaceful boat trip across the English Channel that gave way to clashes on the beach,‚Äù one commenter joked.
‚ÄúPeaceful...gave way to clashes‚Äù No, thugs and lunatics engaged in riots, arson, and looting- which everyone was expecting- because the mainstream media is full of cowards who pay for their houses in the Hamptons by running cover for BLM criminality on behalf of the DNC‚Äî Buck Sexton (@BuckSexton) August 25, 2020

More than one-third of the current US adult population suffers from obesity, which is the second leading cause of preventable death in the United States, according to the NIH.
More than one-third of the current US adult population suffers from obesity, which is the second leading cause of preventable death in the United States, according to the NIH.
With more research showing the harrowing effects of obesity, researchers are looking for safe and effective treatment methods.
As such, the FDA has recently approved a new and unusual weight loss device ‚Äî an external pump that drains parts of the stomach‚Äôs contents after every meal.
The surgically placed tube, AspireAssist (Aspire Bariatrics), is intended for obese patients at least 22 years old with a BMI of 35-55 and who have already tried and failed to maintain weight loss through non-surgical weight-loss therapies.
The FDA approved AspireAssist following a clinical trial of 111 patients treated with the device and appropriate lifestyle therapy. After one year, patients using AspireAssist lost an average of 12.1% of their total body weight, compared to the 3.6% in the control group.
The study also showed the patients experienced small improvements in diabetes, hypertension, and quality of life ‚Äî conditions typically associated with obesity.
Although officials explained this device should not be used in patients with eating disorders, many critics are dubbing the pump as ‚Äúassisted bulimia.‚Äù
The device, considered minimally invasive, includes a tube that goes from the inside of the stomach and can be attached to a port on the outside of the abdomen.
A disk-shaped port valve outside the body is connected to the tube, and 20-30 minutes after consuming each meal, the patient can open the valve and drain approximately a third of the stomach‚Äôs contents at a time.
Once opened, it takes 5-10 minute to drain food matter through the tube and into the toilet.
Research showed the pump could help morbidly obese patients lose a mean of more than 12% body weight unlike most weight loss fads.
According to William Maisel, MD, MPH, deputy director for science and chief scientist in the FDA‚Äùs Center for Devices and Radiological Health, ‚ÄúThe AspireAssist approach helps provide effective control of calorie absorption. Patients need to be regularly monitored by their health care providers and should follow a lifestyle program to help them develop healthier eating habits and reduce their calorie intake.‚Äù
The most commonly reported side effects included occasional indigestion, nausea, vomiting, constipation, and diarrhea, but the surgical placement of the gastric tube could also be associated with inflammation and tearing.
To aid in safety protocol, the device has a feature that keeps track of the number of times the drain tube had been connected to the port and automatically stops working after 115 cycles (about five-six weeks of therapy).
The patients are required to return to their physician for a check up before receiving a replacement part for the device to continue therapy.
While the device is currently on the market in Europe, the company has not yet revealed what the cost in the US might be, considering the cost for surgical implants could vary by center.

On Tuesday 15 November, we took two teams over to Open Academy for the first Football Smash Up event.
Across the evening, we played teams from Sprowston, Notre Dame, Sewell Park, Thorpe, CNS and Open Acadent finishing with our very own Hellesdon derby (A team vs B team)! Due to the emphasis of the tournament being on playing and having fun, rather than competition and winning, the games were self-refereed and teams played on a rotational basis.
Hellesdon boys played well and showed great sportsmanship throughout their matches - well done to everyone involved!Links and cycles II: families of commutation relations, parametrized by knots, in the mapping class groups and beyond

Palestinian residents of the East Jerusalem neighborhood of Sheikh Jarrah have been fighting for nearly a decade and a half against their eviction
Something has been happening recently in the pro-Palestinian movement that hasn‚Äôt occurred in years. The fight by Palestinian residents in Jerusalem against their eviction from their homes by organizations seeking to settle Jews in their neighborhood has become a pan-Palestinian cause. It has been embraced from East Jerusalem to Arab towns in Israel to Palestinians in the Gaza Strip. And no one really understands what brought it about.
Palestinian residents of the East Jerusalem neighborhood of Sheikh Jarrah have been fighting for nearly a decade and a half against their eviction by organizations seeking to settle Jews there. And for more than a decade, weekly Friday demonstrations have been held, attended by both Israelis and Palestinians, against efforts to expand the Jewish presence in the neighborhood.
The end of Bibi? LISTEN to Anshel Pfeffer‚Äôs quick-fire guide to the latest political drama
Israel was shocked a month ago by footage of police officers beating Joint List lawmaker Ofer Cassif at one of the protests in the neighborhood. Prior to this, however, other than during brief periods, efforts to expand the protest to the wider public failed. Even inside East Jerusalem it was viewed as another local issue ‚Äì just as the East Jerusalem village of Isawiyah was fighting police violence or Silwan was protesting archaeological excavations, Sheikh Jarrah was fighting against Jews‚Äô efforts to evict them.
Recently, however, it seems that Sheikh Jarrah has become a symbol. The young Palestinians who have been meeting at Jerusalem‚Äôs Damascus Gate since the beginning of the Muslim holy month of Ramadan have begun urging people to go to Sheikh Jarrah after mosque services. And they have been coming there every evening.
Israeli police have responded aggressively and dispersed them by force. The stench of skunk water fired by police has not faded from the neighborhood following the recent nighttime clashes, which have included arrests, the use of tear gas and the deployment of mounted police.
A wider circle of support has come from Arab citizens in Umm al-Fahm, Jaffa and elsewhere who have expressed their identification with Sheikh Jarrah and come to the neighborhood for the Friday protests. On Wednesday of this week, they also protested in the center of Umm al-Fahm over the issue.
Another source of support is the underground commander of the military wing of Hamas, Mohammed Def, whom Palestinian media reported as saying, ‚ÄúIf Israel doesn‚Äôt stop attacking the residents of the Sheikh Jarrah neighborhood, they will not remain with their hands tied, and the enemy will pay a heavy price.‚Äù
- Over 200 Palestinians wounded in clashes with Jerusalem police as tensions boil over
- What's behind the latest flare-up in Jerusalem, and what Israel can do to defuse tensions
Sheikh Jarrah has become a hot topic on social media. This week, an Arabic version of the #SaveSheikhJarrah hashtag has been trending in fourth place in Israel on Twitter, ahead of the English version. Each of them has attracted tens of thousands of tweets and retweets. Social media have also been flooded with video clips, caricatures and statements in support of residents of the neighborhood.
Again, the reason for this upsurge in activism isn‚Äôt entirely clear. Undoubtedly the sense of victory that Jerusalem Palestinians felt following the Israeli police decision to back down and remove crowd-control barriers at Damascus Gate encouraged young people to look for a new cause. In addition, Hamas appears to have been looking for reasons to heighten tension with Israel over Jerusalem, after Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas decided to postpone elections to the Palestinian Legislative Council. Hamas fired rockets from Gaza in identification with Palestinians in Jerusalem over the barriers at the Damascus Gate.
But all of that follows the legal drama that is coming the fore again on Thursday. For roughly 30 years, Palestinian residents of Sheikh Jarrah have faced the risk of eviction because they live on land that was purchased by Jews at the end of the 19th century in the vicinity of the Tomb of Simeon the Just. The legal battle is being waged between the Palestinian residents and a company called Nachalat Shimon, which is controlled by right-wing activists seeking to bring Jews into the neighborhood.
In recent months, the Palestinians have suffered a series of legal defeats that put about 300 neighborhood residents, including dozens of children, at risk of immediate eviction. Unlike the handful of prior evictions of residents, the number of cases now involved is evidence supporting the Palestinians‚Äô claim that this is not a local civil dispute over land but a more concerted attempt to change the character of an entire area by bringing in Jewish residents.
On Thursday, representatives of the Palestinians and the Jewish organizations are due to inform the Supreme Court over whether they have reached a settlement agreement. An agreement, which by all indications has not been reached, would include a statement of mutual recognition. The Palestinians would recognize the Jews‚Äô right to the land and the Jews would recognize the right of the Palestinians as protected tenants. The bottom line is that any eviction would be deferred but become an eventual certainty.
In the absence of an agreement, Supreme Court Justice Daphne Barak-Erez will be forced to rule on the Palestinians‚Äô request for leave to file a further appeal to the Supreme Court after the Jerusalem District Court confirmed the eviction. If she decides against the Palestinians, dozens of residents would face the risk of immediate eviction in the middle of the month, after Ramadan ends. In August, there would be another wave of evictions.
The legal proceedings have considered the boundaries of the plots of land purchased by the Jews, the nature of the purchase, relevant Ottoman land law and the rights of the Palestinians, who were settled at the site by the Jordanian government and the United Nations in the 1950s, when Jordan controlled East Jerusalem. Other matters include consideration of legal proceedings over the past 40 years.
But all of this might be seen figuratively as the trees rather than the bigger picture, the forest: Israel‚Äôs policy in Jerusalem, which only permits Jews to recover property that was abandoned during Israel‚Äôs War of Independence in 1948. Only Palestinians are subject to eviction from homes where they legally settled 70 years ago.
Recent weeks have demonstrated that what happens in Sheikh Jarrah doesn‚Äôt stay in Sheikh Jarrah. If the evictions proceed, as the Jewish groups hope, and hundreds of people are thrown out of their homes, it would sharply fuel security tensions in Jerusalem and elsewhere. Hopes that with the end of Ramadan, calm will be restored to the city would be dashed. What won‚Äôt end is the injustice.As you may remember from an earlier post, my bestie got married this summer. I needn‚Äôt wax poetic once again about how beautiful and perfect the day turned out to be (it was seriously AMAZING, you guys), but I will tell you a little bit about the custom jewelry I made for her and show you some pretty pictures to sweeten the deal. üôÇ
If you know my girl Kelly, you know that she loves pearls. It came as no surprise to me that she would want to include pearls as a staple element of her bridal jewelry, and I had so much fun designing a set to go with the delicate, feminine look she had imagined for her bridesmaids.
Pale peach, pink, and seamist were the colors of the day. I decided to use white pearls as a starting point for the bridesmaids‚Äô necklace, then added a peachy-pink floral cabochon to the design to bring in a little color and texture. Since the matron of honor‚Äôs dress was unique from the bridesmaids‚Äô, I used mint-colored mother of pearl beads to tie in the full color palette to her look.
Kelly wanted the coordinated earrings to be simple and elegant, so I suggested a small drop earring with white and pink freshwater pearls. All of the bridesmaids wore this same earring design, which did a nice job of tying together the collective look.
Kelly and Chris‚Äôs wedding day was one of elegance, joy, and beauty. I‚Äôm happy to have had the chance to contribute to that beauty, and to have stood beside my dear friends on the day they committed their lives to one another.
Xo, Ali
